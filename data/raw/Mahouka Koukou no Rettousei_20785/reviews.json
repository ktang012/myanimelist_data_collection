            "content": "- This Review Contains Spoilers -\r\nI'm not entirely sure why I watched all of Mahouka. At some point it was a scholarly interest in why this was the latest hottest thing in light novels. It might have been because people said it gets better in the novels later and I wondered at what stage that would be. At another point it was purely to see if I could finish it as a personal challenge. If I could keep watching I might be able to find something good about this anime. Something that at the end of the day I could say \"sure it was mostlybad, but there was this one thing about the show that was enjoyable\".\\n\\n\r\nI never found that thing. I can find nothing to recommend about Mahouka. It is bad on pretty much every level.\\n\\n\r\nThe first point it fails at, and the main point that drags down the entire show, is the main character. Tatsuya Shiba is a highly talented magician who has been placed in the crappy kids class. He's there because he is bad at pushing a square inch wooden block across a floor with his mind. This is the only thing he is bad at in the world of magic. He is a master magician who can cancel out other magicians magic. He's baffling intelligent to the point that he can calculate mind-bogglingly complex magical problems in milliseconds. In his spare time he's the world's greatest engineer, fronting as the mysterious Silver creating the best magical equipment in the world. He solves magical problems that the rest of the world have been struggling with for years. He creates the power of flight on a whim. He can see through walls. He can take down an entire platoon of terrorists by himself. He can detonate the power equivalent of an atomic bomb over anywhere in the world. He can heal all wounds instantly. He can raise the dead. But he is not very good at pushing a square inch block across a floor so clearly he's a flawed character.\\n\\n\r\nWhen your main character is as perfect as this, there is no tension. There is no struggle. Any problem presented to Tatsuya can be solved with no issue. Yet the show likes to pretend he genuinely has factors against him. It's purely lipservice though that has no practical limitations on his capability to do literally anything. Whenever the show tries to make me feel like Tatsuya is inconvenienced, it ends up flipping around and making me feel like I should be on the side of the people against Tatsuya. It got to the point that for long periods of the show I found it easier to treat Tatsuya like he was the villain.\\n\\n\r\nYou know that big Darwinian speech given by Charles Vi Brittania from Code Geass where he goes on about how the strong will destroy and subjugate the weak and that's why everyone will bow down to Brittania and all hail Brrrrrrrrritannia? That's Tatsuya's, and by extension the author's outlook on life. Except when Charles delivers his speech about the myth of equality, it's by Norio Wakamoto hamming it up to 11 as the most evil character in the world. In Mahouka it's Tatsuya delivering the speech about how equality is a bad thing and we should destroy those who seek to change that, and we're supposed to agree with his outlook.\\n\\n\r\nThe weird thing is, Tatsuya would make a pretty great supervillain. His calm attitude and dangerous intelligence is perfect Bond villain material. He's a cold-blooded killer who wipes out several thousand people without remorse during the show. You can totally do villain as protagonist thing. Light Yagami did a pretty good job of it as a similar smart person with dangerous beliefs and phenomenal power. Tatsuya though is always presented as the hero. All the villains are terrorists, more terrorists, and the Chinese, none of whom are presented as anything other than cardboard cutouts of villains. The first episode shows that the school has a dumb system where less magically talented kids are treated like shit by the upper class of magical students. But instead of coming to the conclusion that the whole system is dumb because it creates a class system, the show comes to the conclusion that the system is bad because it didn't rate Tatsuya highly.\\n\\n\r\nSo we have unstable foundations from which to build this show on, but what about the more superficial presentation angle. Are the magical fights fun? No.\\n\\n\r\nTechnobabble. Magical sequences in the show are interrupted by long explanations of the magical theory behind them. Characters would sit in the cafe and discuss magic. Tatsuya would move a block across a room then launch into a lengthy explanation why this was difficult for him. Tatsuya would explain why wizards flying is really difficult for most of an episode and then proceed to solve it a minute later accompanied by another explanation. I got a pretty good grasp on the world's magic system by the end of the show, but these scenes are all excruciatingly boring even with that knowledge. Eyes glaze over as they talk about oscillating magical frequencies and squiddidly heebijeebies and whatnot. What was even more frustrating is you could use none of this knowledge to enjoy the show more. None of the explanations helped the viewer understanding what was going on in a battle better or let you work out what was going on yourself. Even with the knowledge of magic I gained, it never became useful to know for anything else. It wasn't building lore either since it felt mostly like reading from a highly boring textbook. So what was the point of these lengthy magical explanations?\\n\\n\r\nThe explanation is pretty easy really. You know in Kill la Kill one of the characters would have an explanation as to why Matoi Ryuko gained this incredible power of hers, delving into theories about life fibres and so on, until Mako would burst in and yell \"so what you're saying is Ryuko has awesome powers\", turning the entire previous conversation into a hilarious joke that outlined that none of it was really important? That's Mahouka's magical explanations except it's explaining why Tatsuya is totally awesome. Also it's not played as a joke.\\n\\n\r\nWhat these magical explanations also do is make Mahouka very dull to look at. The vast majority of the show is talking heads with no artistry put into their presentation. The magical fights are equally pretty dull with no interesting fight choreography. In general Mahouka is pretty bland visually and doesn't have great animation either. The music, since I'm on the subject of production values, is also pretty bland. A bunch of generic jpop for OP/ED and insert songs is the most it can muster. The pacing is also awful, in particular during the middle and boringest arc, and again I can attribute this mostly to these Tatsuya-appealing sessions of lengthy magical explanations that ultimately lead to no conclusion beyond Mako yelling \"so what you're saying is Tatsuya is totally awesome right\".\\n\\n\r\nThere's also a whole load of nitpicky problems. One that bugged me was the show's weirdly conservative treatment of women. Tatsuya's sister is madly in love with him, but oddly that didn't bother me too much because it's just another method the show uses to  appeal to Tatsuya. No what I'm referring to is the weird way anytime a woman would wear something other than the most skin-covering clothing, a character would comment on how they should cover up and stop being such a dirty whore. Usually by Tatsuya, because he's a gentleman *tips fedora*. All while the camera pans lovingly up the underdressed woman's skin and makes their boobs really shiny. It's a small thing, but it compounds with lots of other little things that make me really start to resent the author.\\n\\n\r\nI really tried scraping through my memory banks to find something I liked about the show, but I could come up with nothing. I mostly just found more and more nitpicky problems the further I probed. The character designs are bland to the point that I kept mixing up characters. It has too many characters in general and there were a large chunk of them for whom I didn't understand their purpose. That one episode where the student council leader gave a speech during a debate that solved nothing but somehow their opposition thought they were defeated by this incredibly speech. How boring the presentation of the magical sports were and how bloody long they kept showing them. Perhaps the closest I can think of as a good thing about Mahouka is how, by the end, Tatsuya's power goes beyond the point of even self-parody. So what, one wry smile from the whole show, and even that is an ironic one?\\n\\n\r\nHere's a suggestion for you if you're thinking of watching Mahouka. Puff your cheeks out. Now stick your tongue out slightly. Now blow air out of your mouth so it escapes under your tongue. This should cause your tongue to make a rasping noise, not dissimilar to that of a fart. Congratulations. You have now done something more fun that watching Mahouka with about as much artistic merit.",

            "content": "Alright, despite giving a score of 9, allow me to make this perfectly clear, THIS SHOULD NOT BE WATCHED BY EVERYONE!!! There are three very crucial aspects to this show that form a fissure among the viewers. If you are able to tolerate or enjoy these aspects, watch this show. If you find these elements unbearable then you should definitely walk away because they are ubiquitous throughout the entirety of the 26 episodes.\r\nI: An over-powered protagonist. When I say over-powered I mean it in the most literal sense possible. This guy does not lose, ever. He's a genius with combat capabilities surpassing every other personwe encounter within the show. This world practically made him a god. Someone tell Kira to take notes because becoming this guy is how you really conquer the world. You will never have to ponder who will emerge the victor, the contest was won as soon as our hero decided to make his appearance. If this aspect will bother you, DO NOT WATCH THIS SHOW!!! This never proved bothersome to me. I accepted the simple fact that this narrative would have a god in the driver's seat and just enjoyed watching the moments when the other characters realized the true power our protagonist held. \\n\r\nII: Exposition heavy dialogue. The dialogue can be said to bore some people to tears with the snail-like pace it moves at. In this story it's not just that magic exists, no, there is a system to it. This system that is more akin to science than the traditional wizards and wands style. The specifics of this system of magic, it's integration into society, the social standing of those who can use magic, all of it is explored through the dialogue. A fight with magic will occur and the next 10 minutes will be a discussion of the fight.  History, politics, and a magic that behaves as science are all explored in heavy detail. If that sounds monotonous, pass on this title. Personally, I found this fascinating. I loved that the author took time to craft a world filled with detail and societal nuances.\\n\r\nIII: Hints towards an incestuous relationship between the two main characters. With the main characters being an elder brother and sister who are very close, incestuous hints are littered throughout their interactions and thoughts. This never impacted my enjoyment in the slightest, it's a work of fiction, not myself. I can separate my own actions from that of the characters. Not to mention the simple fact that I could not think of any reason as to why incest is fundamentally wrong (potential genetic issues in offspring irrelevant, reproduction not mutually inclusive), but I digress. If you dislike seeing siblings with a relationship that seems to go beyond the standard definition of a sibling relationship, then do not click play on that first episode. \\n\r\nFor all of you who find yourselves unperturbed by the aforementioned elements then by all means, keep reading. Now, onto the standard format for reviewing on this site:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nThis story is far from unique. Two new students showing up to a school and taking an ax to the beliefs and perceptions of the entire student body is nothing new. These siblings arrive and the foundations that everyone believed to be stable are shifted. That being said, I loved the execution of this concept in the world the author created. In my exposition portion I mentioned that this world has an incredible amount of detail to it. Said detail is exactly why I love the idea of shaking the roots society stands upon. The school has a very discriminate social standing that our main characters are able to shatter. \\n\r\nOutside of the school itself we also have the governmental structure of Japan, foreign nations and terrorist groups, etc, etc. These components were all stacked together to build a world that felt real. \\n\r\nThe narrative of this show is arc-based. This shouldn't be surprising given that light novels serve as the source material. The arcs follow a logical sequence of time and progression, so a drastic disconnect between the episodes never seemed to exist. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nThe animation was fantastic. Madhouse once again came through in extraordinary fashion. The movement was fluid which was especially noticeable in the combat scenes. The back-drops were pleasant and the color palette was rich without feeling exceedingly vibrant. \\n\r\nThe character designs are also something I found particularly nice. It's an absolute fact that most men are going to be larger than women. Greater height, broader shoulders, simple size and body mass. Yet all too often this fundamental truth is all but forgotten in the world of anime. But not in this series, no, the characters in this series are for the most part correctly proportioned. This also applies to females in the sense that they weren't erroneously sized in their bust. Not being a fan-service show that may seem to be normal, but even then this show felt real in regards to how the characters were built. The remainder of the character designs (faces, hair, etc, etc) were also pleasant. You won't find exceedingly wacky hair styles or colors. The majority of the main and supporting cast were fairly individualistic in design, but there are a few noticeable exceptions where two characters will appear to be carbon copies of one another. \\n\r\nOh, and a special note: Coolest school uniforms ever. The end.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nThere's not too much I can say in this department. The OST was good, but at the same time it wasn't particularly special. Featuring a lot of techno music each scene was complimented well. \\n\r\nThe voice acting was also solid. The respective actors managed to express the unique qualities of their characters. Their performances weren't too stand-out or deserving of excessive praise, but at the end of the day I could say they did a good job.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\nThis score is probably pretty surprising. I mean, with an over-powered main character there's no way he could actually be a good character, right? Well, this is where I disagree with many people. I am not one to say that \"over-powered\" and \"bad character\" are mutually inclusive terms. They can be synonymous, sure, but no subjective thought could ever be set in stone. Tatsuya Shiba, or as I like to call him - Japan's lord and savior, is a 16 year old genius who comes across as very calm and apathetic. He possesses almost no magical affinity but still shows up at the magic high-school to study as an engineer. His combat capabilities aside, I think Tatsuya is a good character. He may come across as just a boring lump of clay with a sister-complex, but as we come to learn of his dry humor, logical manner of thinking, and direct mannerisms, my perception of him as a character was altered. He never undergoes any sort of development, but we do get insight into his past, learning why he is who he is, discovering why he holds his sister so close to his heart. His emotionless attitude becomes sympathetic, bordering on tragic. \\n\r\nThen we have his sister, Miyuki Shiba. Her character can be summed up as this: \"Onii-sama\". (And get used to that name, you'll hear it a lot.) I kid, I kid, Miyuki harbors extreme love for her brother (so much so that it might as well he obsession), but she does have a few additional aspects that make up her personality. (The name still stands, though. Many, many times will \"Onii-sama\" grace your auditory glands). Miyuki is in part the ideal daughter. She's intelligent, capable, well-spoken, beautiful, her genetics and upbringing ensured she would be nothing but the best. She's also a girl who holds a great deal of resentment towards her family, simultaneously feeling extreme gratitude towards her brother. She has a massive brother complex and most of her actions are taken in an attempt to help her brother or make him proud of her. However, I do think that I am in the minority for finding Miyuki to be an interesting character. The large majority of those who watch this show find her to be bothersome and annoying. But fear not if you happen to be one of those who find her irksome, her initial presentation in the first few episodes changes slightly, accompanied by less screen time as the episodes progress.\\n\r\nThe supporting cast is fairly large. You have the respective councils within the school, the normal students, military personnel, family members of students, etc. None of the supporting cast are particularly deep characters, but I wouldn't classify them as complete cliches either. On first glance these characters will seem to fall into a general archetype. Contrary to that initial perception, however, these characters do not fall into the pitfall that is stereotyping. As I said though, they are lacking in depth. Whilst walking the path of a character, Mahouka's managed to get past the trap of cliches, but stopped short of the bridge of development. One element I loved about the cast on the whole was their perception and strength. Tatsuya will definitely steal the spot-light, but these characters are all skilled in their own regards Some fights they will manage alone, some explanations will come from their own lips. Tatsuya is ultimately the one who will save the day, but prior to his arrival we witness the remarkably adept capabilities of the cast.\\n\r\nA special shout-out for the best girl that is Mayumi Saegusa. The adorable student council president and the only character capable of trolling Tatsuya to the same caliber he trolls others. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nI won't lie, I initially turned this show on after looking up shows with a bad-ass protagonist. I had watched one too many series with a weak male that had to be protected. One too many series where the protagonist was the only character to over-react to a situation. This show was a fulfillment of my wish to not watch a spiky-haired pansy get his ass kicked. I never expected an emotional narrative with compelling themes and deep symbolism, I just wanted a protagonist that would kick ass in a spectacular fashion, and this show delivered. The copious exposition was just a bonus for me who loves detailed world building. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nI loved this show. The sheer amount of \"Holy shit that was awesome\" moments made this show great. From the first episode I never looked to see who would win, I just wanted to see how many jaws Tatsuya could drop when he showed the world how he won.\\n\r\nAll in all, if you want to watch two siblings who love each other very much kick some ass, accompanied by friends that talk about how the two siblings just kicked ass, watch this immediately. \\n",

            "content": "The conception of \"perfection\" we previously had is going to change, because after watching Shiba Tatsuya (the protagonists show) in action, the word we used to describe the type of character which is sightly too powerful among his peers, overpowered, is going to be \"Onii-sama\" from now on. With Shiba Tatsuya, better known as Onii-sama, we reach a level of perfection never seen before in the anime industry, characters we reputed as OP, notable recent examples such as Kirigaya Kazuto (Sword Art Online) or Gilgamesh (Fate/Zero), are practically nothing next to our glorious Onii-sama, capable of turning the Impossible into something actually possible.\r\n> Is aproblem an OP character as main then?\\n\\n\r\nTo that question I reply: \"not necessary\", since an overpowered main character isn't a big iceberg enough to sink an entire ship, we have plot development and side characters after all; and overpowered isn't a synonymous of \" Bad\", sometimes is good to watch a main character that isn't completely a weakling, but problems comes when the plot's development is nothing more than a series of events made to emphasize the greatness of our main characters, plural, because Onii-sama didn't descended from Heaven alone, there is his sister, the main female protagonist, Shiba Miyuki, another example of absolute perfection, to accompany him in his journeys.\\n\\n\r\n> So this is an anime about these perfect couple of siblings and nothing more?\\n\\n\r\nWe aren't that far to describe this show with that phrase up here, but actually there isn't a better phrase to describe this show neither, since the anime I'll now introduce you is going to be the anime with the most perfect main protagonist I've seen in my whole life, and as you've probably noted, the word 'perfect' isn't used with a positive tone in this review. I'll now claim that I haven't read the LN, this is going to be my judgement from what I've seen in this adaptation.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is set on the year 2095 d.c, after the conclusion of the Third World War and the introduction of the Magic System, magician isn't a term anymore related to fairy tails, Science and Technology converged into what we now call Magic. Society developed itself around this new form of Science, and this lead the necessity to create new generations of youngsters capable of crafting this new kind of science, so Magic High Schools were born. This show follows a particular brother and sister, fresh enrolled in the First Magic High School (there are only 9 in the country) at the beginning of the first episode. \\n\\n\r\n\"We're not the same\"\\n\\n\r\nAs everything that isn't \"uniform\" in the Society, it creates a fracture between the population, racism in few words, and Magic is not the exception. Some individuals are more capable of others, that is a fact, and so is also related to Magic. People who show an incredible magic ability form the Course 1 in the High School, and the others, less capable, form the Course 2. Somehow Onii-sama sucked at the enrollment test score and ended in the Course 2, the so called \"Weed\" course, meanwhile Miyuki ended in the Course 1, the \"Bloom\" course. How a perfect being such as Onii-sama ended in the course 2?, that will be explained through the show, something I'll not reveal, let's keep going. Funny fact that actually all Onii-sama's friends, course 2 people, are above the course 1 students in matters of skill combat and magic. This is the classic shounen pattern where all the protagonist's friends are better than everyone else and save the world, with the difference that only Onii-sama is able to save the day here, the rest aren't of any use actually.\\n\\n\r\nIn this 26 episodes adaptation from the best-seller Light Novel, there are adapted three arcs, each of them, naturally, revolving around Onii-sama and his friends dealing with an unexpected conflict, unnaturally always is Onii-sama the center of everything that happens in this show, leading the viewers to ask themselves a such basic question as:\\n\\n\r\n> \"If Onii-sama doesn't want his true identity being revealed, why does he keep trying everything to be in the spotlights every time?\"\\n\\n\r\nSuch a million dollar question sadly didnt get an answer, events just keep happening and Onii-sama always saving the day, in the most perfect possible way. And that just seem to be irony, since a characteristic of this show is that of explaining EVERYTHING, well...at least the things related to magic spells, magic sequences and effects. Practically a huge time was spent on explaining things that aren't real and somewhat irrelevant for the development of the story, time that surely could have been spend in a more useful and productive way.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of characters was surely wide, we have practically a character for every kind of stereotype. There's the glasses girl, the tomboy, the cute and moe girl, the silent girl, the tusndere, the Student Council President, the best protagonist's friend, the bad guy who didn't accept the protagonist but later he accepts him, the rival, ect ect ect. Actually none of them had an important role in this show, since its all about Onii-sama, but we're able to find something in common between them, possibly the only reason why the author decided to create side characters for this show, and that would be: \"to praise Onii-sama and his sister\". Actually that may sound like a joke but believe me when I tell you it isn't, every single side character in every single episode, when they aren't wasting time explaining Magic related things, that remaining time is spend on praising Onii-sama for x, y and z reason, a fact that I found overly above the ridiculous level.\\n\\n\r\nBy the other side there's no need to spend a lot of words for our sibling protagonists, there's only a word capable of containing all their essences, 'Perfect'. Onii-sama is good at everything possible imaginable, every presented female character falls for him but he doesn't have eyes for any of them, because Onii-sama cares a lot about his sister, and that was stated several times through the show. Meanwhile Miyuki is his female counterpart, a beautiful young girl which excels in Magic and in everything she does, I'll just end here to write about them, since my writing skills are way too far of being perfect to describe this pair of siblings in the proper way.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to Animation and Sound, at least, this anime isn't mediocre, animation is made by Madhouse, characteristic trademark of this studio is the high quality animation of its adaptations. The actions scenes were quite fluid and very well done, camera angles and sudden zoom ins and zoom outs were coordinated very well, as well as the OST fitting them, electric-rock oriented, we can't say its perfect as our protagonists but we can say its done quite well, above average for sure. OPs and EDs were quite nice, Rising Hope by LiSA was by far my favorite song from this show.\\n\\n\r\nAt some point of this show I couldn't take seriously anything that was happening, too much perfection, events emphasized to show how great the Shiba siblings were, too much useless explanations, pathetic side characters, and a lot of details I didn't mention because they're spoilers, overall is a quite interesting anime that shows how would be to have a perfect MC gaining the praise for each side character presented, something completely original I must say, nothing that I've seen come close to what I've seen in this anime but this is not surely something I would feel to recommend to people.",

            "content": "Set in 2095, magic is now a form of technology and science. After the 3rd world war, magic wielders were high in demand in the world to defend their individual countries from further chaos. Mahouka follows two siblings, Tatsuya and Miyuki Shiba, who are enrolled in Fist High School. Based on enrolment test scores, the brother becomes a Weed, a presumed low-achieving magician, while his little sister becomes a Bloom, a presumed high-achiever in magic. However, there's more to these two siblings than as first thought. And school life at First High School will no longer be the same...\r\nAnd thus, the most anticipated, but highlycontroversial, anime of the spring season has reached its conclusion. Controversial in the fact that this series ranged from \"Mahouka is the best anime ever!\" to \"Wow, this series is complete BS.\" So how did it truly turn out? Was it as good as the die-hard fans claim it was? What about the opinions of the critics who truly despise this series? I find that Mahouka truly fits in between the two; it's neither really good, nor really bad. It was nonetheless a somewhat enjoyable anime series that I didn't regret watching.\\n\\n\r\n\u2028\u2028Before I begin, I will say that there's a high chance that you may end up being in either of the aforementioned polarizing sides. To make things a bit easier, for those who really like and would only watch a huge action-packed series with an adventurous plot, non-stop fight scenes, and emotional characters like some shounens have, you probably want to stop reading this review and find another anime series. The relatively slow-paced Mahouka will actually bore you really fast, and would DEFINITELY not be for you. I probably weeded out a few of you, and you'll thank me for it. Now, I can't guarantee that this review will be spoiler free, but let's dwell a bit further into this series, shall we?\u2028\u2028\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\r\nMahouka focuses on two main leads, who are the Shiba siblings, Tatsuya and Miyuki. The series is split into three arcs, each having a specific school event attached to them (enrolment, a school competition, and a thesis competition). The general idea of Mahouka is that conflict arises, usually from a specialized group having ulterior motives for magic, preventing these school events from going as calm and smoothly as planned, and the students from First High School and other acquaintances will have to deal with them. Conflict doesn't happen immediately, however; everything is set up with loads of dialogue and explanations. Unfortunately, the huge amount of set up can turn stale for some viewers.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem about Mahouka is definitely its pacing. Some would find this series to be incredibly slow due to all the explanations and dialogue used to set up a conflict, especially as a shounen anime. This is highly prominent in the first arc. Later, the events in the story became extremely rushed, which happened most often in the second arc. Most magic was no longer explained in its entirety, and some prior background have been omitted at times. I ended up consulting light novel readers a few times of what I just witnessed. Regardless of your opinion on Mahouka, this is easily the biggest flaw. I like to turn that around and use it as a way to say that this series is unpredictable in nature because of this pacing. You don't know what will Mahouka bring the next episode, but even this can be a relatively frustrating process, especially considering that the plot had very good potential to be great. In all, the story was executed well to a certain extent, but it definitely could of been better. Viewers will have to acknowledge this imminent flaw should they decide to take the plunge to this series. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, each arc does have some pretty interesting perks in the story. There were very well thought out concepts for all the arcs, but the 3rd arc of the series (Episodes 18-26) was easily my favourite. Of course, I won't say what happens then, but for me, the final arc made the series a worthwhile watch. It might be frustrating to have to consult LN readers at times to know some background facts that Madhouse has omitted, as well as a lot of confusing bits here and there, but it's flushed out enough to at least give a small sense of satisfaction at the end to the typical anime watcher such as myself. 6/10\\n\\n\r\n\u2028Art\\n\r\nNo complaints here. The art style is very typical of shounen anime, and instances where the animation quality gets noticeably bad is extremely rare. Action scenes are fluid and flashy, while the character designs are very cool and slick. Honestly, those are some pretty badass school uniforms. There's nothing about the art and animation that really stands out compared to other series, but it gets the job done, and does the job well. I really give Madhouse credit for the great animation quality of this series. 8/10\u2028\u2028\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nAnother one of the better points of this anime. Mahouka has a huge cast of characters (which will be explained later), and Madhouse pretty much recruited the best of the best to voice them. No character sounds awkward or out of place, as most match their individual character's personality very well. I mean, it's like a dream team of all-star seiyuus, including Yuichi Nakamura (Tatsuya), Saori Hayami (Miyuki), and Kana Hanazawa (Mayumi), just to name a few. A job well done to all the voice actors and actresses involved in this series. \\n\\n\r\n\u2028LiSA's \u201cRising Hope\u201d is arguably one of, if not, THE best opening song of Spring Anime 2014, while GARDiNELiA's \u201cgrilletto\u201d stands up as one of the better opening songs for Summer 2014. The ending themes are decent too, but sometimes, the ending scene of an episode does not transition well into the song, especially when suspense was attempted to be made. Mahouka's OST is good in general, and definitely sounds very shounen-like. A good plus side of the series. 9/10\\n\\n\r\n\u2028\u2028Characters\\n\r\nNow, this is the second category that many individuals critic about Mahouka. The story focuses on Tatsuya Shiba and Miyuki Shiba, two characters that are, for some reason, really hated by a lot of people out there. Do the Shiba siblings make or break the series? For some, there is that chance. So I'll explain the pair to the best of my abilities, alongside the other characters of series, and note the places where some people hate about them. \\n\\n\r\n\u2028Tatsuya is enrolled into the First High School as a weed. This would mean that he's presumably weak in magic, right? Wrong. Rather, this guy is seriously overpowered. We definitely can question how on earth was he determined to be an inferior weed in the first place due to these placement tests. The problem some people have over Tatsuya is that he is claimed to be just another \u201cGary Stu\u201d. He only seems to get more and more OP as the series progresses, making him pretty much the \u201cperfect\u201d protagonist. I personally don't think he's completely perfect; he comes at the cost that he rarely develops emotionally. Tatsuya in a sense doesn't feel human, which does make it difficult for him to fit with his classmates and live a perfectly normal school life with his little sister. His lack of human emotions is definitely a conflict that he must always go through, and is something that is explored throughout the series. \\n\\n\r\nTatsuya's mysterious nature definitely creates some suspense in Mahouka. We know Tatsuya is great, but just HOW good he is? What skills will be pull off next? The enigma that is Tatsuya really makes viewers wonder just who the hell he really is. How many things he can pull of his sleeve is pretty damn incredible. Heck, his classmates don't really know who he really is as well later. Tatsuya is an enigmatic character, but whether this is an enjoyable trait is definitely up to the viewer. \\n\\n\r\n\u2028Miyuki is the other main character, who is perhaps as controversial as his older brother. Miyuki is your beautiful, smart and kind female character that many look up to. However, her personality and ideals in general, like Tatsuya, are very simple. Some may argue that it's even bland. Oh, and she may have a slight bro-con for Tatsuya. I'm pretty sure all the complaints that Madhouse got over her cries of \"Onii-sama\" ended up having her get less screen time later in the series. Now, it definitely isn't as black and white as this; however, Madhouse unfortunately does not dwell into this further, which is something that I'll be looking into in the light novels. I do like Miyuki, mostly because of her sincerity and well-mannered demeanour, while getting notable roles in the story as well. However, I'll note that both Tatsuya and Miyuki barely undergo development throughout the series, at least emotionally and a character as a whole. If you get frustrated about characters who really only develop in terms of OPness, then this probably won't be the series for you. For others who don't mind, you're in for a treat. \\n\\n\r\n\u2028The supporting cast is very cool, but they are the supporting cast for a reason. After all, Mahouka centres around Tatsuya and Miyuki the most, who are relatively mysterious but simple individuals in the first place. Some characters appear in episodes to glue some parts of the story together, but they don't get quite enough spotlight to have them fully develop. Again, a lack of character development may be a flaw of this series for some viewers, but that would be way too much to put in a 26-episode series, especially considering that some parts were already feeling rushed. There's at least enough of a blueprint for all the supporting characters to be able to pick a favourite. I personally love the student council president Mayumi myself, but I was slightly disappointed that she didn't get that much time to develop as a character. Overall, this huge cast of characters is nice, but unfortunate sacrifices had to be made in order to prevent these 3 arcs from stretching over 40 episodes. 7/10\\n\\n\r\n\u2028\u2028\u2028Personal Enjoyment\\n\r\nThis series is flawed, yes. The pacing of the story is my biggest concern, with a somewhat lack of character development being another. But I did have the motivation to continue and look forward for the next episode. I personally found the series to be quite enlightening, and there was enough substance for me to be intrigued to continue in watching, even if I know there was quite a few things wrong about it. The concept of Mahouka is very nice, although Madhouse may have not brought it out to its full potential. I do look forward to reading the light novels and continue the series from there.\u2028\u2028 8/10\\n\\n\r\n\u2028\u2028Overall\\n\r\nOn a completely realistic overview, character and story must be weighed more than the art and sound of an anime series. The former may be the weaker points of the series, but it definitely isn't AS bad as some people say it is, nor you should write if off just because of the flaws I've listed above. This is a series where you really have to see it to give a proper opinion on it. Don't inflate your expectations, or you will be disappointed. If you are interested enough after the first few episodes, I'll say that you'll be on the road to watching a pretty nice series. Will it blow you away? No. Will this be a waste of your time? Mostly likely no as well. All in all, despite some flaws, it has been a pleasure watching Mahouka, and I hope some of you will consider watching this series as well! \\n\\n\r\nFinal score: 7/10\\n\\n\r\n(First review, feel free to give some feedback!)",

            "content": "What does it mean to be a good main character? Does it mean being weak and growing strong throughout the story? Or could it mean starting strong but learning how to overcome your weaknesses in order to continue growing? How about starting off absolutely perfect at everything other than noticing girls affection for you? Well, if you answered \"no\" to that last one, you should probably stay away from this show. If you answered \"yes,\" let me show why I believe that is not the right way to create a protagonist.\r\nShiba Tatsuya is a new high school freshman at a prestigious magic academy in near-futureJapan. Magic is being studied like a science and used in order to gain an upper-hand in a long-lasting global conflict. Tatsuya and his twin sister Miyuki happen to be excellent at using magic. Despite that, due to some poorly explained reason, the absolutely-perfect-at-magic-in-every-way-ever-showed Tatsuya somehow ended up in the lower class at the school though Miyuki ended up in the upper class. Most of the students in the upper class look down on the other students as being inferior. Tatsuya soon breaks that boundary and forces his way (and is forced) into the student council by being absolutely perfect. Still, it will take more time than that to fully mend the broken relationship between the upper and lower students. That's just a bit of the stuff that happens at first in MKnR. The story is divided up into several arcs ranging from a few episodes to around ten episodes in length.\\n\\n\r\nI'll go over the characters first since that really is the biggest downside to the show. There are way too many them. This show throws characters at you left and right with minimal explanation given for most of them, and almost zero back-stories for anyone, even the main duo. There is nothing to connect to these characters with emotionally (unless you can relate to having a brother complex). They are bland, two-dimensional characters who serve almost no purpose other than to further the plot, though most don't even do that much. Most characters' designs are so similar that they are easily confused with one another and made even more forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the main duo, Tatsuya and Miyuki Shiba. They are twins from a wealthy and powerful family that is shown on a couple occasions but left out of the picture for 99% of the show. Tatsuya and Miyuki are both flawless with the exceptions being that Miyuki has a brother complex she cannot admit, and Tatsuya is terrible at noticing he has about a handful of girls with a crush on him. Tatsuya seemed like an interesting character in the first episode to me. He was looked down upon due to the class he was put in despite actually being quite skilled. However, the main reason (as I have said and will say many times) is his utter lack of any flaws. He doesn't even seem human. Similarly overpowered genius protagonists like Yagami Light from Death Note and Shiro from No Game No Life are far better than him for that reason. Despite being extremely cunning and seeming to win in basically every situation, they have flaws that make them seem like actual people. They have greed, lust, jealousy, emotions, goals, etc. Tatsuya just goes through this story beating everyone in his path without showing hardly any emotion at all. Even in unimportant situations like just hanging out with friends, he is stoic and emotionless and bland. He always says exactly what he needs to say and executes plans without any hitches. I really don't see why any other characters are necessary in this story since it seems like he could have done everything himself. Miyuki is also similarly strong, but ends up playing a damsel in distress role on one or two occasions making her not quite as perfect. She tends to be rather emotionless as well unless she is flustered romantically or embarrassed. She and Tatsuya together are just some of the most boring main characters I've ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is not much better. Given the huge character cast and boring main characters, the story tends to be slow paced and takes too long to explain things. 90% of MKnR is spent explaining. Almost every time an action scene occurs or a new magic is shown, the show stops and has the characters indirectly explain to the audience what happened even though I never really cared to know most of the time. There's no letting the viewer piece together events to figure out how things occurred. The information overload often makes you forget things as new info is poured into your brain faster than you can stop and think about anything that's been said. Plus most things that are explained are rather unimportant overall and make it hard to focus on the actual important information.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is shoddily done. Created by the same group in Madhouse who did the failure that was Mahou Sensou, the animation really brings down the company's famous name in the anime industry. The characters' faces are devoid of expression throughout the majority of the show and everyone's design is so similar with nearly the same facial structure given to all characters. The backgrounds are not very detailed and the foreground images are sometimes noticeably poorly drawn. On the other hand, the action sequences have good choreography and are well thought out. Most of them involve group battles that involve strategy between fighters. This is also where the animation tends to be the best.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is mostly techno music with some rock music thrown in for some of the action scenes. The music does a good job of adding a nice calm, yet mysterious atmosphere to some of the scenes with explanations galore and makes them slightly better. There are many tracks that are used too often though, and many scenes are devoid of any music where some really should have been used. The second OP and ED are excellent despite the first ones not being anything out of the ordinary.\\n\\n\r\nThis show flops on nearly all aspects. The gigantic character cast with no personality or development was truly the biggest hindrance. Tatsuya is just so flawless that there is absolutely no tension created because you can be sure that he'll wrap everything up easily and move on to the next problem. This show could have been much better which is the most frustrating part. It had potential and an interesting premise but wasted it all on pointless or bad characters, poor animation,  and an ending that politely asks for a second season without really offering anything worthy of receiving it.",

With it's rave reviews from different sites, you can't help but think that this should be one of the favorites for 2014. \r\nUnfortunately that is not to be and if I could sum up this series in one word, it would have to be \"disappointing\".\r\nIf BGM's were included with reviews, I know mine would play Public Enemy's \"Don't Believe the Hype\" as that's what's been running in my mind when I wrote this.\r\nSo getting back to whyI rate this series poorly:\\n\\n\r\nMahouka isn't original and if anything, tries to borrow a lot of settings/tropes which I've seemed to have come across already in manga and anime:\\n\\n\r\n- You have the magic high school setting\\n\r\n- A 'Gary Stu' who for the most part feels like was written as pure fanfic wish-fulfillment ridden with plot armor\\n\r\n- A 'Mary Sue' little sister who for most of each series is pretty annoying with her \"onii-sama this and onii-sama that\"\\n\r\n- The stereotype society who looks down on said 'Gary Stu' for not being at 'their level'(even though he pretty much overpowers every character in the series so far)\\n\r\n- The stereotype friends who place said 'Gary Stu' on a pedestal \\n\\n\r\nStory: 3\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 5\\n\r\nSound: 4\\n\r\nCharacter: 3\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4\\n\r\nOverall: 3\\n\\n\r\nThe series is bland in terms of animation and sound, and coming from a studio whom I actually like(Madhouse), I am pretty disappointed in regards to the overall outcome in which the series has been portrayed.

            "content": "\"Onii-sama\", these words are the very heights of the human spirit, they are the essence of a male soul. It is the light that will guide a man during his darkest hour. Make your imouto recite these holy words exactly 167 times over the span of 10 hours and you will be granted what your heart truly desires, my child.\r\nMahouka is like solidifying the shit your dog left on your mattress with liquid nitrogen then dipping it into gold and expecting people to buy it just because it's shiny. And well, people buy it. Apparently. ...Well, actually, that's not quite the case. Mahouka should havebeen just another forgettable fighting magic school themed story adapted from a novel, except for some inexplicable reason, it gets popular. Mahouka is really just boring op-magic-imouto-harem garbage that adopts a not-quite-so-distasteful complexity within it's written dialog. About the only positive thing that I can really say in it's defense is that it somehow manages not to be torture. \u2014 Ah, yes! This is proof that the otaku culture is truly a bliss!\\n\\n\r\nEvery damn magic spell is accompanied by long winded explanations and technobabble. None of which is used for world building, characterization, or whatever else that it could possibly be used for. Zip, zero, nada. The \"intelligence\" in the script is just there for the author to stroke himself \u2014 or I should say Tatsuya Stuba's dick, technically?\u2014 Perhaps it's actually an abstract form of fanservice, it follows this sort of mentality of \"the more complicated the vocabulary the more depth the character has\", uguu! It's similar to the intelligence-fetihization of a loli in the whatever plethora of lolicon tittles I couldn't be bothered to mention. Hey, I would even go as far as to say that the whole series was built around this technobabble. I mean, if you're going for needless complexity in such volumes, why not go all the way and write a pseudo-political thriller a la Code Geass instead? We already have Spinzaku here, and Tatsuya is pretty much scumbag Jesus anyway. At least that would have been more eventful than all of the nothing that happens in the twenty-six episode run of this anime. Something else I should mention, they try to incorporate this idea of discrimination but they don't do anything with it. They had actually tried to justify the puerility of these teenagers pretending to be mature just to rather quickly brush it off with an empty speech. Funny because, this whole issue of \"labels\" could have stopped Mahouka's script from further plunging itself down the drain. The script is actually pretty terrible whenever you aren't being bombarded by technobabble. It's either harem garbage, hue hue not-really-incest heh heh heh heh, or indirectly stroking Tatsuya's dick. The action scenes can also reach irksome levels, almost as bad as what you see in hollywood movies. The Incompetence displayed by the terrorists can be described as simply sad. You would think that being equipped with sub-machine guns and RPGs one could be able to at the very least kill one person in a considerably populated school. \\n\\n\r\n\"There's no one who can possibly defeat my brother.\" - Miyuki.\\n\\n\r\nRepeat the above piece of dialog thirty-or-so times with slightly different variations and you can begin to see the quality of writing in Mahouka, if you haven't already. Also, yup, what Tatsuya has isn't just any piece of armor, what he has is reinforced plot armor that's heavier and thicker than a whales hide. \\n\\n\r\nSuffering several bone fractures, damaged organs and massive hemorrhaging? Not a problem, he'll just magically restore himself back to perfect health. Getting shot through the heart? Barely so much as tips him off balance a bit. Catching bullets with his bare hands? You betcha~ \u2014 There's absolutely no tension when a character is this powerful. And that isn't even the worst of it, the biggest offender of all happens in the last episode. It speaks for itself really. \\n\\n\r\nNo, better still is his ability to make girls drop their panties faster than you can say \"bullshit\". He does this in his usual inhumanly calm demeanor without so much as lifting a finger. No, he doesn't even flirt with the girls, the reason for this being because imouto pussy is best pussy. Just about every female subconsciously gravitates towards him and instinctively want to have his babies because they just know that he has superior mating capabilities. \\n\\n\r\nNo, wait, wait, wait, wait!! Tatsuya is a deconstruction of the Gary Stu archetype as he's actually a pathetic fatass okatu in a show that's actually a clever self parody.\u2014 Just an instance of Mahouka's brilliant comedy, when a high-school girl whose been hiding behind a tree gets her position compromised, she escapes her pursuers in the most dramatic way possible: by getting on a cheap looking scooter that actually takes off with two jet engines. You just have to see it for yourself, I'm clearly not writing it down correctly.\u2014 Tatsuya may not look like a fatass with an imouto fetish... but that's because you're already under his spell, see? Yeah, it's a spell of his that affects all your senses so you can't tell. When Miyuki asks if she looks weird in the new apron she bought for him to see her in, he replies with \"You look lovely. So much so that I want to secretly display you in a glass case just for me.\" See? This is proof that he's a fatass basement dweller. It simply won't do you any good to deny facts.\\n\\n\r\nOh, wait, how could I forget? Whenever these two say anything incestuous it's just a joke. \\n\\n\r\nFinal verdict: 0/10 Nowhere near racist enough, needs more propaganda.",

            "content": "I thought this anime was going to be really good. I watched the first episode and thought maybe it gets better later (which I was told happened in the Light Novels). Sadly it didn't. I really wanted this anime to succeed, with my friend introducing it to me. However it's not what it's lacking is the problem, it's what it does too much of.\r\n~Story~\r\n-I gave it a 5 because I hardly could get into the story. When it introduced a school setting, alarms already started going off in my head. 'Oh no, this isn't going to be one of those convoluted teenage identity crisis dramasis it?'. Thankfully it wasn't. Unfortunately it was something else just as bad. Seriously what is it with this \"Blooms and Weed\" classification of the students? This really doesn't make sense because it's just another little path for the Gary-Stu of a main character to completely trample like he does everything else. A little action here and there, mostly exposition, almost NO development of plot or character. Utter bore.\\n\\n\r\n{Art}\\n\r\n-It's not too shabby. The fight scenes are nice with the magical effects and what not. Only problem is, the fights last like what? Less than a second? No seriously that happens. It's foolish. The reasoning behind it is even more so. However it is decent, passable. \\n\\n\r\n[Sound]\\n\r\n-Same here, although the droning of the main character doesn't help. Not much to say honestly because it's just that: fair. Nothing great but at the same time nothing bad to point out.\\n\\n\r\n\\Character/\\n\r\n-Oh boy here we go. Like I said: the MC was emotionless for a reason which was extremely stupid. The relationship between the MC and his little sister is just iffy. Why does it exist? Is the creator trying to tease at some sort of incestuous relationship? Is he trying to induce some sort of comedic value (since it is only hinted at). Besides that little sister is just plain soulless like every other character in the show. She's only there to make the older brother look good like some sick fantasy of a wish-fulfillment  type story. Without him? She's absolutely NOTHING. At least the other characters have some sort of niche trope to fill although still laughable since the main character is just so good at everything. (stu stu stew stoo) \\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment-\\n\r\n-Interesting AT FIRST because I was hyped to see this \"magic\" in action. I saw the first fight. I tried to be forgiving, watching it recapped in the second episode. Disappointment. All this show did was talk about something. Nobody ever said \"I FEEL this\" or \"This makes me want to do X\". And there's the problem right there. Almost little to no expression. And if these characters are so unwilling to show some real emotion? Why should I? Oh yeah like I could feel sorry for that samurai girl when she was an idiot for mistaking her senior's words a few years ago. Honestly, there was nothing to pull me in. Nothing to say: 'Watch this anime, it's interesting for this reason!'. But there is no reason. Do I want to see triumph after triumph? No. I want to see development, feeling, action. Some substance to this lifeless anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\n!Overall?\\n\r\n-It was bad:\\n\\n\r\n-Story was boring. It was a generic school setting with generic student barriers with a generic unbalanced ratio between female and male student characters. Yeah, you know where I'm going with this.\\n\\n\r\n-Art was Ok\\n\r\n-Sound was Ok\\n\\n\r\n-Boring characters with little to no substance. The MC was boring and never made anything interesting. His little sister is a damn barbie doll. Everyone else is there to make our robot of an MC look good.\\n\\n\r\n-Nigh enjoyable, unless you like to jump on hype trains, see Gary-Stus just do boring stuff because of self-projection unto characters FTW. \\n\\n\r\nIt could have been good. It really could have. Removing the little sister because she provides nothing but a pseudo goal for the main character would have immensely improved the story because then it would have been fun seeing a robot own everything and then do some exposition for the hell of it. Giving the characters more substance because: seriously... what are their names again? Anyways, not much to say but don't blame me, blame a boring anime. Cheers.",

            "content": "I just found out about this website... It's pretty neat. I'm going to try writing a review on here for an anime I really enjoyed: Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei.\r\nSo, for the story part of this anime, I have to say that it's really cool. First half of the show takes place in a Magic School, where people learn magic. But not like wizardry magic, but a futuristic technology that allows people to use magic. There's a lot of dialogue that may annoy people, but I personally found the dialogue really interesting. There's a school magic competition, and multiple magic schools compete in it. Pretty funto watch. The second half gets even better. It's about another organization trying to sabotage the Magic High competition, and it goes even further than that. The ass-kicking that goes on in the 2nd half was the best.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and the music are the best parts of the show. The art was perfect HD-level beauty. The opening and ending songs to the show are one of my favorites ever. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters of the show, oh man. This was spectacular, there are so many great characters. But I'll start with my favorite anime character ever, Shiba Tatsuya, the main character. He is so overpowered and badass, it was a beaut to see. Furthermore, my name is Tatsuya! We have the connection! But really, all the characters were awesome, except for Shiba Miyuki, whose love for her older brother was sort of disturbing. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime so much, and I'm guessing that this is where I recommend this anime to people. I definitely recommend this anime to anyone that likes magic and badass main characters, and can sit through some dialogue that I know a lot of people will dislike.",

            "content": "I've probably said this some time before, but I'll say it again. I hate light novel adaptations. Not all of them however. Some of them in fact, have proven to be great in fact such as Baccano, Spice and Wolf and the Monogatari franchise but the vast majority are near enough the exact same god damn thing. Some boring as hell high school character who is a beta male joins a new school and instantly gains a harem and becomes the number one fighter. Rinse and repeat every season. These shows are vapid, boring and appeal to the lowest common denominator and yet, still becomemassively popular. When I saw this show announced a few years back and noticed who were making this anime, I had some hope. Maybe Madhouse can make a light novel adaptation great? Unfortunately my hope dropped as quickly as when Grandma fell down the stairs.\\n\\n\r\nThe Irregular at Magic High School aired in the exact same season as another masterpiece; Black Bullet, which should give you some indication into the quality we're talking about here. The narrative of this wonderful work of fiction centres around the 'God' type of Light Novel guy in a world in which magic has become a technical skill. These main characters are the ones who are the most badass guys around, keep a cool and calm composure and can do literally ANYTHING that the plot demands them to do. The most famous Light Novel guy of this archetype is my good o' buddy Kirito from SAO and Tatsuya, from this show, is NO different. He can seemingly do anything and everything while also remaining insanely strong and overpowered to the point that no one in this can actually lift a finger to him. It's like if you were in a Yu-Gi-Oh! tournament and your first opponent were Yugi; you're royally screwed.\\n\\n\r\nAs a result, none of the fights have any tension what-so-ever since our Light Novel God never loses and even in the few situations where it appears he might be on the edge of losing, he will pull some random power-up out of his ass and end up winning with the power of 'plot armour magic'. It's incredibly hard to attach yourself onto him or to feel any narrative stakes in the show when they're so clearly trying to aim just for that since Light Novel God has no personality to speak of. He is an emotionless robot with no personality and always has the same deadpan expression. He feels lifeless; dull.  It's understandable to think he behaves in this fashion due to his upbringing and the such but the character hardly ever experiences any sense of levity or hints at an actual human underneath his veil of a badass guy. Aside from the fact that he wants to do the birds and the bees with his sister. Yup! \\n\\n\r\nThis is another troupe of Light Novel God's archetype. They ALWAYS have a little sister or cousin that is madly in love with him to the point of them very heavily hinting at them wanting sexual intercourse with their sibling. Light Novel God's imoutoto is also perhaps the most annoying character in this show and that's saying a lot. She is constantly defending her brother from all criticism of others, while not allowing any girl aside from herself to get near him (Yuno Gasi, much?). The show presents any character who so much as slightly dislikes Light Novel God to be an evil asshole! As if anyone who dares not to like him must suffer from the fate of falling down Grandma's stairs. She is presented as the perfect girlfriend only making her waifu bait for body pillows and masturbation purposes. Her character goes nowhere and remains as Light Novel Guy's perfect waifu, only to add onto his list of already perfect qualities. This is lazy writing 101. Why should the audience feel that Light Novel God is anything less than perfect? Why should he have faults which would make him feel more real? Oh, I know why! Because he is now easier to self-insert for all of the damn basement dwellers. \\n\\n\r\nLight Novel God is a guy who is always morally correct, always the one teaching others life lessons and has a sad and 'totally not forced' back-story in a pathetic attempt to make the audience feel sorry for this guy. After Light Novel God and Imouto-whore attend their new school, they're split into two different classes depending on their skill level and despite Light Novel God being the most overpowered character this side of Dragon Ball Zeee, he is placed in the 'weeds' class while imouto-whore is placed in the 'Blooms' class. The anime attempts to try and shove down our throats the theme surrounding the discrimination of wizards between the higher class and lower classes but like everything else in this show, goes nowhere in the slightest. It's a sad attempt to make the people attending the school with Light Novel God to believe he is weak and pathetic for him only to contradict this every episode by showcasing his insane talent. Why the hell he was placed in the lower class, I have no clue. The main idea of this theme was so that the audience can sympathise with the character and feel excited when he proves himself but it becomes so pointless as he has every power under the Sun so his victory never feels earned. \\n\\n\r\nThe story goes nowhere and all of the terrorist attacks, evil organisations and tournament arcs are so forgetful as there are no interesting characters in the slightest. Every other side character is constantly sucking the dick of Light Novel God for his awesome talent and the fact that he is a nice guy. None of the side characters get hardly any screen time and the show feels like it's constantly going around in circles with no direction or plot progression. Light Novel God's attachment to this story is as strong as my attachment to a Twix bar. It's hard to care about what is going on without any characters to feel invested in especially when everything in this show is dull to the eye. That's another thing with this show. It's not remotely interesting visually either. The animation is pretty standard and there are no errors or moments of quality drops it's just that the entire production is so visually dull with boring colours, framing and shot composition that it's hard to stay awake and watching this show feels like a chore, even more so with how little the plot actually progresses half the time. It has a good budget, it's just all of it is boring.\\n\\n\r\nThe exposition in this show is on par with the crap in Black Bullet. They throw around so much techno mumble jumble that it's hard to make sense of what is going on. Light Novel God goes into these long and unbroken narrations into the intricacies of a magic technique which go on for so god damn long it becomes so tedious to watch and makes me want to fall asleep. And these exposition scenes can go on for upwards to ten minutes sometimes! Damn! Show, don't tell! I understand explaining stuff is important but Jesus! Every fight is essentially only two minutes in length followed by a bunch of twats talking for half an hour about what just happened. This makes sense in text form, as time slows down when you're reading but the adaptation is a far different story. This still doesn't make the light novel good; please don't think that...it's still awful.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Mahouka is a poor wish fulfilment piece of garbage and these shows need to die out. The theme exploration is a joke, the characters are overshadowed by Light Novel God, the plot has no sense of direction and it wasn't even entertainingly bad. It's dull, static and does nothing right. It's crappy fantasy empowerment for basement dwellers. \\n",

            "content": "Mahouka is the worst anime of all time. It's the twisted dream of a hateful lunatic who shuts out the outside world. The impression it gives of itself is of something highly paranoid and self-righteous, designed to feed into the delusions of people who want to imagine themselves as silent martyrs.\r\nThe central character, Tatsuya, is a superman, who is impossible to defeat in combat, portrayed as more intelligent than every other character, and is found attractive by every female character in the show. The argument has been made that he is, in fact, an antihero, because he uses these abilities to do things that aretraditionally considered morally bad. To this I would say:\\n\\n\r\n- Even when Tatsuya\u2019s actions are portrayed as morally ambiguous or even morally wrong, he\u2019s still framed as the victim. He\u2019s had his strong emotions removed, and is therefore the show refuses to hold him responsible for anything he does that he really shouldn\u2019t do.\\n\\n\r\n- The show frames him as morally superior to all of the characters who are his enemies, be they foreign terrorists or other students who mistreat him.\\n\\n\r\n- Many of the villains in the show are motivated by jealousy toward Tatsuya.\\n\\n\r\nThe first point is the important one. Tatsuya is treated as a victim at every turn. His sister, essentially the secondary main character of the show, is completely defined by guilt over the fact that Tatsuya had his strong emotions stripped for the sake of protecting her. She becomes a mouthpiece that the show uses to point out when we are supposed to feel bad for Tatsuya, with no agency of her own beyond a profound desire to be subservient to him. It\u2019s not even possible to say that her perceptions of his suffering are just a part of her subjective experience as a character, because what she says is shown to make the other characters agree with her.\\n\\n\r\nA corollary to the victimization of Tatsuya is that other characters in the show who would be victims are blamed for their own suffering. Everything Tatsuya is put through he endures without ever complaining. The people who do complain are framed poorly because of it. The first arc of the show involves tension at the school because the Course 2 students, who did not score well on the entrance exam and were therefore denied instruction, are constantly bullied and mistreated by the others. They want to end this, so they protest by occupying areas of the school. This is nonviolent civil disobedience, which is not inherently bad - there is nothing wrong with breaking the rules when you've exhausted every other measure of making people listen to you. However, the show demonizes the Course 2 students for doing this. After their protest is shut down, they are given an audience with the student council to talk about what they think could be changed in school. However, when they come to the negotiations, the Course 2 students did not have any coherent demands. According to the show, they did this because they wanted and expected the student council to do all the work for them. Already it frames these people as lazy and unintelligent; they were given a pre-arranged meeting, and yet they did not come prepared with any points to make. This is simply ludicrous, an obvious strawman. It follows this with a debate between the student council president and a representative of the Course 2 students. The debate goes that every point made by the Course 2 student was outright false, and the student council president gave a speech. The lengths the show goes to to portray the Course 2 students as stupid or lazy are absurd; the Course 2 representative was so demonstrably wrong in everything he said that we wonder how he even came up with his points in the first place. Then, in her speech, she said the Course 2 students were to blame for their own mistreatment because they didn\u2019t stand up for themselves. At the same time, she chastises the Course 2 students who did stand up for themselves for not doing so in a way that respected the rules - the rules that have so far failed to prevent Course 1 students from trying to literally decapitate Course 2 students. She also said that while she did not think discrimination against Course 2 students was acceptable, she did not want \u201cnew discriminatory practices\u201d to be put in place. This, of course, is a logical inconsistency; the Course 2 students never did or said anything to give the impression that they would cause new discrimination. To say that they did is inconsistent with the show\u2019s internal logic, as it was clearly stated within the same episode that the Course 2 students had no demands or ideas. But the show runs with this strawman. Her speech is accompanied by shots of Course 2 students hanging their heads in shame, and is followed by applause from the whole student body while a golden light glows from behind her. \\n\\n\r\nSo, Mahouka resolved its first story arc by blaming the victims of discrimination for their own suffering because they didn\u2019t stand up for themselves, but also blamed the victims who did stand up for themselves for not doing it in the right way. It did the latter by presenting a completely fabricated strawman argument and acting as though it were sound. The conclusion was that those who lack power have only themselves to blame, and should just respect the status quo in the hope that those who do have power will magnanimously decide to give them rights.\\n\\n\r\nMeanwhile, Tatsuya has also been a victim of discrimination. He was wrongly classified as a Course 2 student, and the (male) Course 1 students treat him poorly for it until he gets the chance to prove himself. He was granted a chance by the system, whose rules he obeyed, and he took it. So, it would be unfair to say that Mahouka totally denies the Course 2 students the chance to make themselves look better; it\u2019s much more insidious than that. It says that the way to make oneself look better is to hold to old-fashioned values, which Tatsuya does, but as the show goes on the real ugliness of those values comes to light. \\n\\n\r\nThe morality to which the show subscribes is rooted in a persecution complex. Tatsuya is portrayed as a stronger and more credible person than any character who actually acts on their own suffering because he endures it all. He is a silent martyr, one who never complains, operating under the assumption that all people who mistreat him are either too evil or too stupid to respond to protest, and that protest is therefore pointless. It also says that such stoic victims like him are heroes, because they\u2019re able to take on suffering other characters can\u2019t endure. Even if you would argue that the casual way he kills people in the show is meant to paint him as an antihero or even a villain, the dialogue later in the show clearly states that he is the real victim and that the only reason what he does seems horrible is because he does things normal people need done, but can\u2019t handle, and that this is why he is the only one fit to carry great power. And yes, the point is that he is the only one: There is a scene in which another character is moved to take action, inspired by Tatsuya's success - only to be stopped by Tatsuya because he can't take it.\\n\\n\r\nThe entire show has a military mentality, as if every single aspect of life should be treated as a war. Some people will agree with this. Those people are fascists. Because of this mentality, it doesn't matter that Tatsuya isn't good at moving eggs across a table with magic when he's immortal, can fly, can destroy an entire country from his living room, and can vaporize people from a distance.\\n\\n\r\nIf his defining character trait is that he suffers quietly, then several other characters are defined by their jealousy of him. They have all gone through suffering, and never see him appear to suffer. The problem with this is that even if it were admirable to take every transgression without complaining, that is no justification for demonizing people who express their pain or break the rules when the system has only hurt them and done nothing to help them.\\n\\n\r\nThe main message of the show comes across as this: The way the world SHOULD be is that those in power are people who can tolerate hardship better than others, and that other people should either learn to suffer silently or know their place so as not to get in the way. It\u2019s completely one-sided in favor of the powerful. You could argue that the show is critical of people in power because they\u2019re the ones who are victimizing Tatsuya, but those are people who do not take suffering as well as he does, and the conflict of the story is that they should not be in power; rather, Tatsuya, Jumonji, Ichijo, and the student council president are the people who should have power, the current people in power are not strong enough to be in power, and everyone else is weak and in need of protection, and therefore civil disobedience is biting the hand that feeds. The problem with this is not even that it's inherently untrue, but that it romanticizes the struggle of people in power (people who don't need romanticizing) and denies the importance of the people under them, treating them only as a burden and another source of suffering.\\n\\n\r\nApparently disjointed from all of this is the show\u2019s attitude toward women. In one scene, the camera lingers on a woman\u2019s breasts in the middle of a serious conversation. This is already bad; what business does the camera have doing that in those circumstances? But what makes it worse is that immediately after this, Tatsuya criticizes the woman for dressing too revealingly. Nothing about this is OK; it gives the impression that what she was wearing was so important that it warranted interrupting a serious discussion, and it makes it so that the previous shot wasn\u2019t just the camera perving at her but trying to frame her in a negative light at the same time. And another thing: Her clothes weren\u2019t actually revealing at all. This happens more than once; that isn\u2019t the only time a character is called out for dressing in \u201crevealing\u201d clothing. In another episode a character wears an outfit that lacks sleeves. It\u2019s a completely innocuous outfit that wouldn\u2019t look out of the ordinary to any reasonable person, but another character takes one look at her and says \u201cOh my, that\u2019s rather revealing.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nObviously it should make no difference whether the outfit is revealing or not, but the fact that the show decides to draw attention to it, especially when using the descriptor \u201crevealing\u201d is outright false, is absolutely Victorian. The only character who dresses in revealing clothing and isn\u2019t called out for it is Tatsuya\u2019s sister, and she never does it in public; she only does it to please Tatsuya. \\n\\n\r\nThe show also draws attention to the women\u2019s outfits during the interschool sports tournament, in which it dismissively labels a sport in which female students participate as something they only do to show off the costumes they wear while doing it. All this is less egregious than the show having a one-off joke about a male student saying he would force himself on a female student before pairing them off as teammates for the rest of the story. Not to mention it was Tatsuya's idea that they should be together.\\n\\n\r\nOn the sports tournament, the show\u2019s second arc that lasts eight episodes: Everything that happens in it is devoid of tension and entirely irrelevant. First High School wins every sporting event in a total blowout, leaving no excitement because you always know from the start that they\u2019re going to win. Also, all their success is attributed to Tatsuya. What\u2019s more, the entire arc, all eight episodes, is almost completely empty of anything significant, offering no substance at all except more glorification of Tatsuya at the expense of other characters. It doesn't have any relevance to the main plot, either, which wouldn't be a problem if it contained any interesting matieral, but it doesn't. It\u2019s one long, boring tangent.\\n\\n\r\nAnd yes, the word boring is actually another good way to describe this show. The vast majority of the dialogue consists of explanations of why the different magic spells used in the show worked. This information is completely worthless; there's no reason why we should need to know all this. Extensive \"worldbuilding,\" in better shows, can be used to discuss a real-life concept, to produce something visually interesting, or even elevate the entire setting into the realm of symbolism. None of this happens in Mahouka. It is one of the least visually interesting shows available outside of a couple action scenes, the extensive explanations of magic aren't even relevant to the show's own plot (let alone real life), and it doesn't reflect the show's ideology. It just creates an artificial veneer of \"complexity\" that doesn't relate to the rest of the show.\\n\\n\r\nBy the end of the show, Tatsuya's powers suck all potential conflict out of the story. That\u2019s when Mahouka becomes a total non-narrative. It\u2019s just a long delusion designed to gratify people who see themselves as being similar to Tatsuya; people who believe that if only other people would notice how great they really are, they would be recognized, and who take pride in the fact that they feel bad all the time but never complain about it. Ultimately the antihero argument doesn\u2019t hold up because the cinematic direction of the anime glorifies him, he never does anything bad to anyone who didn\u2019t deserve it (usually in some overblown evil fashion), and he is never held fully responsible for the bad things he does. Even if he was, the speech given in episode 4 is indefensible, and tilts the rest of the show entirely in Tatsuya's favor no matter how hard it may try to frame him as an antihero.",

            "content": "There is a reason why anime with a setting that revolves around a high school rarely becomes successful. Because it is to me one of the most overused settings for the last few years and only once in a while does it work out particularly well like in the case of the Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. Now with this show there is a lot of hype around due to the proclaimed success of its light novels. I personally haven't read them myself so I can't say for sure how good it is. But after viewing six episodes I feel I can give my unbiased reviewof this show that was adapted. For starters it brings up a topic that's been been shoved down our throuts since any of us as children started school. bullying and discrimination. Yes it tackles this issue head on as the issue many people in this story face comes in one of three types. The oppressed victims who see no way out, The overconfident and biased opressors, and the realists who realize true equality can't exist but can be made better. I feel that part of the reason this show got so popular in the first place was because of how relatable it's premise is because everyone at some point in their life has either been bullied or was the bully for the sake of popularity. Now in this show that reasoning for the bullying or harassment has simply been about perceived intelligence due to grades. Because this show separates people in two classes with outfits that easily distinguish them \"course 1\" the honor students, and \"course 2\" the remedial class students\". The general idea in this school is that if you are in course 1 then for some reason you get the right to be a complete dick to everyone in course 2. They even have a different, more straightforward but offensive term for the course 2 students and have called them \"Weeds\" while course 1 are \"blooms\" due to their potential as magic users and weeds percieved inability to grow. Now that we got the premise here the main character is something that contradicts this class based system. There's Tatsuya Shiba, he is a course 2 student with skills that are in practical use, far superior then even those of course 1 but this is due to how the school evaluates certain qualities in students way more then others which is pretty realistic given how they work. His personality as a character is to be cool an reserved and his motivations are simple. Get the diploma from magic high school and become a magic scientist. Now I know what you are thinking, why did I give this show a 7 out of 10? Because there are some serious faults when it comes to this show.\\n\\n\r\nList of problems\\n\r\n#1 the main character has a blood-related sister who loves him and the relationship is one sided and extremely echhii. I don't understand the big deal with brother-sister relationships in anime and can be extremely off-putting if not in the right light. I have seen this work many times like with attack on titan with Mikasa and Eren and even the show currently airing Hitsugi no Chaika makes it work because they aren't echhii or blood related. If they didn't put too much focus on this I'd probably have a a better time watching this show.\\n\\n\r\n#2 Too big a cast of supporting characters and not enough variation in character designs. There are way way way too many people in this show to make this work for a 26 episode anime, so many that I highly doubt that you can remember half of them as their character introductions are also very short and abrupt and they also all wear essentially the same uniform with the only two things that can possibly make them different are the flower or grey shoulder patch or the the pattern on the blouse for females. It's made it so I can only focus on the main character and what his main focus is for the time being. Because of this I can't feel like I should care about most of this supporting cast as they more or less take up space.\\n\\n\r\n#3 the main protagonist gets all da bitches. Yes just like in sword art online literally every girl in the school is interested in Tatsuya for no real reason. This is serious wish fulfillment right here as some of these girls from course 1 should be shrugging him off but instead are flocking toward him. And that brings me to the final problem\\n\\n\r\n#4 easily distinguished class structure. If a school wants to make honor and remedial classes, that's fine, if they want to categorize these classes, that is also fine, but whoever was the genius to that decided that giving kids uniforms that clearly differentiated their grade level from one another wouldn't cause discrimination has got to the biggest idiot on the planet and isn't realistic as to how schools are ran.\\n\\n\r\nSo with that I give this show a 7 out of 10, it can be an interesting show when the magic starts flying around but don't get your hopes up too high",

            "content": "Honestly, I thought this anime was schlock. Literally the only things I enjoyed about it were the art direction (some of the magic looked really cool, surprisingly) and the premise behind it was intriguing enough to give it a shot. \r\nAfter 10 episodes, I'm done. I can't do anymore, and i can't in good conscious recommend anyone else follows this show. \r\nThe characters are paper thin. Tatsuya Shiba has no emotional depth or complexity in any real or meaningful way. And were that intentional, were the anime to demonstrate how dangerous divorcing oneself from emotion and refusing to empathize with others can be, that wouldbe fine, I suppose. But the prime means by which it could manage this is through his sister. And when presented with this opportunity, the show basically goes \"Fuck that, instead she wants to sleep with him.\" She's used as a means of propping up how great he is, rather than a humanizing element of a show in desperate need of it. Every single character is sterile, boring, serving their plot purpose with no real humanization behind them. Nearly every single female character swoons over Tatsuya, to the detriment of their own character, which is annoying as hell too. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot is garbage, but I could have lived with a garbage plot! I would have been fine with just a schlocky, terribly plotted-and-paced show with cool fight scenes, were it not THIS bad. There are multiple instances in the beginning that basically go \"hey so you know how these people face oppression and a societal system that continually treats them as lesser? FUCK 'EM, IT'S THEIR OWN FAULT.\"  Rather than attempting to take a complex look at a system where people are disproportionately privileged, it chooses a hyper-simplistic route, saying, in essence, that the reason people are less privileged is because they don't deserve it. \\n\\n\r\nThat's not an exaggeration, by the way. There's literally a scene in which they discuss a terrorist organization and Tatsuya basically goes \"Oh well, their main issue is with the disproportionate median income, but you see, magicians DESERVE to be richer, they just work that much harder and they're that much more important.\" \\n\\n\r\nWhat I saw of this series left a bad taste in my mouth. Decent looking animation and some mildly cool magic and concepts don't make up for terrible plot, worse characters, and generally gross Author Preaching coming from the characters. If you could send somebody around to give me a severe enough concussion that I forget everything I know about this anime, that would be fantastic.",

            "content": "Allow me to ask some interesting questions\r\nWhat is the point with action?\r\nWhat is the point wiht suspence?\r\nWhat is the point with character development?\r\nWhat is the point with problems or struggle in anime?\r\nWhile we all have different opinions on this matter we can all agree on one thing, all of those things above are needed in order for us to enjoy a show and feel that the story and characters can make progression, it is then we can say that it was good.\r\nLet me tell you about a show that ignores all that, a show where nothing matters except for one thing, the hero of thestory. A show where only one person matters and the rest of the cast is there simply to serve the hero and to be amazed at how the hero is so good. This hero is named Tatsuya Shiba and the show is called Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei or The Irregular magical highschool in english. So stay a while and listen.........\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nIn the future where magic rules and is the law, where you are considered a outcast if you cant use magic correctly or lack in any department. Even schools are segregated based upon this theory, upper and lower classes. It is here where our main protagonist is introduced. Tatsuya Shiba and his sister Tatsuya Miyuki enters the magical school but in different classes. Tatsuya is placed in the group of Weeds which is the low class magic users. They have scored the low on all the exams and are considered usless while at the same time his sister Miyuki is placed with the Blooms, an elite group who even have different uniforms with more style on them so to speak. \\n\\n\r\nOK, this does not sound so bad right? i mean, this could be good, an documentary about human friction and relationships with different ranks could be quite good. A brother on one side and the sister on the other, this boils down for some good and emotional conflict right?. WRONG. The very first episode and ep 2 showcases that Tatsuya is simply placed wrong becouse he cant clean bathrooms but he is very powerful, in fact, it is showcased that he can do everything and when i say everything i mean exactly that. The conflict between Blooms and Weeds are later thrown out and it does not even matter after few episodes becouse this show is not about society nor its struggle, its about a light novel protagonist that is so OP that nothing matters anymore. This show simply becomes Tatsuya Shiba adventure where he is put into different scenarios but even this is pointless. Story from now on simply stops and i dont care.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nDear lord, lets begin.............\\n\\n\r\nTatsuya Shiba\\n\\n\r\nThe main hero of this stupid non existent story. Tatsuya is one of the worst characters i have ever seen in anime and i have up to this point watched around 216, sure it may not be much but enough to judge this asshole and how ridiculous he is. This show is supposed to be an action show but with him, sorry, all the battles, everything he does boils down to that he is so OP that nothing matters, nothing. I bitched about Kirito from SAO the way he was but let me tell you, Kirito is simply a child and a crybaby compared to what Tatsuya is. Tatsuya can heal, revive people from death, stop nuclear weapons, disable weapons with an EMP, pretty much nothing stops him. He is cold and only speaks wise words, you know becouse its edgy. I think that he would fit more of an antagonist role becouse he is smart and everything he does, he had planned it from the start.\\n\\n\r\nThis is not an human being, he is a monster of an character, he is what many cool kids wants to be, allways win, allway be on top of things and allways have the cutest girls around him so they can drool on how amazing Tatsuya truly is. The fact that he is still a kid in school makes this almost like a comedy of sorts on how retarded and pendering this entire light novel adopations truly are. Tatsuya Shiba is everything that is wrong with OP charcters, well no, not character becouse and actual character have a personality, Tatsuya Shiba is everthing in one, a Monster that a mad doctor made in a lab somewhere.\\n\\n\r\nMiyuki\\n\\n\r\nAnd now to his sister, an incest infected sister at that. Miyuki is there for one thing and one thing alone, to glow and drool over her big brother and how awsome he is. Oni sama, oni sama and more oni sama, thats her character in a nutshell. To make things even worse, she is also in love with her own brother and blushes every time he says somethng good to her. When other girls show any kind of interest towards Tatsuya she becomes hostile to them and to her own brother for daring to offer his affections to someone else than her. What an pure garbage character, like any girl in this show, she is there to be rescued when danger appears, she lacks her own goal, her character is basicly to have her brother for herself and allways want his body near her. i think you get the point.\\n\\n\r\nAction scenes and expositions:\\n\\n\r\nIf Tatsuya was not bad enough the entire show is so damn boring, remember those long and boring science classes, for me i allways fell asleep during them. this is exactly how i feel about this garbage, the long expositions is simply way too much dragged out. One battle takes about less than a minute to conclude but the show then spends over 3 minutes to talk about the battle and what happened during it. The writers felt the need to go into detail about magic, science and what not. I dont think a lot of people will even care about it, they are here for the action not some badly written expositions and tries to be so in deph that we all loose the interest. Instead of flashing out the world,setting and story the show spends time instead on science which i dont even care about. This show gets it all wrong, exposition is good but only if it serves the overall narrative.\\n\\n\r\nThen we come to the villains and the battles, man, what the hell went wrong here?. Oh yeah, Tatsuya. I mentioned previously what the point with action series was and this show simply does not care about suspence, tactics, strategy,planning and consequences after each battle and what would happen if you loose. This show says goodbye to everything and makes Tatsuya a hero who defeats his opponets with absolute ease without even trying. The series tries to establish that a bounch of terrorists is about to attack and they have powerful weapons on them. Damn,getting good right? WRONG, Tatsuya can disable the weapons with one swoop by using EMPs or whatnot. Yeah, so much for suspence. \\n\\n\r\nOne othe scenario that is often showed is that the girls gets trapped but by now you know by now that Tutsuya will save them and that is what the show is waiting for. He allways shows up and he for some reason, allways can forsee everything that will happen. By that point, you realize that nothing is exiting anymore and also i started to question why they even animated the battles to begin with, calling it battle is even insulting to the word itself. Pure self insert garbage from the beginning to the end.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\\n\r\nThis show is the worst pieces of gargabe that ever came out from Japan. Everything that is wrong with anime protagonists and LN:s is here. OP character that ruins every battle, has control on all situations, having even other characters to be there just becouse of him and more. Kirito was also Op in his own show but at least he had some human side to him but Tatsuya is on a whole new level of retardness. A fantasy \"self insert\" written by an 10 year old who just started to write fanfiction for the first time. Everything that happens in this show lacks becouse there is nothing at stake and even if it is, you know it will be solved, the show simply holds time until Tutsuya shows up and resolves the situation in less than a minute but we have to spend about 25 minutes per episode on this garbage.\\n\\n\r\nThe irregular Magical Highschool is one of the most pontless shows ever made in my book. If you watch one episode, you have seen them all. Incest sister, OP Tatsuya, pointless and wasted potential, non existent characters, stupid expositions that is pointless and wasted budget on the animation for the battles which by the way can be predicted by simply watching 2 of them.\\n\\n\r\nMahouka Koukou no Rettousei is a monster of a show and an insult to your intelligence.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

It was most likely the next hot thing when I first saw it probably...\r\nWell, it's terrible and here's why.\r\nI've read the LN as well, won't add it to my list as I don't wanna see it there.\r\nIt's bad as well.\r\nThe only good thing about it was the concept behind the magic being scientific. But if it ain't executed right, does it matter? lol.\r\nThe thing that drags the entire show is the terrible as hell main character.\r\nFirst of all, it doesn't miss a single moment to pamper the main protagonist.\r\nWithout even trying I already haveabout 9-10 times they repeated ''how great he is''... ''what a prodigy he is''  ''How capable he is'' ''He's the strongest in the world'' in mind.\\n\r\nYet they also love to victimize him at the same time so he is sympathetic as well... well it doesn't work when he's probably the definition of perfect.\\n\r\nHe's overpowered as fuck. A talented magician placed in a crappy kids class. He\u2019s there because he is bad at pushing some block on a floor with his mind. Surely they will not judge his capabilities solely based on that and will give him other tests? Nah, dude... why would they? -__-\\n\\n\r\nHe is a brilliant magician and can cancel any other magician's attack and he\u2019s stupidly intelligent to the point that he can solve the world's hardest magical problems in less than a second. When he has some free time he is an engineer, going by the name of the oh so mysterious Silver creating the best magical gear in the world. He solves magical problems that the rest of the world have been struggling with for years. He creates the power of flight just cause he suddenly thought of doing that. He has a freaking X-ray vision. He can take down an entire team of terrorists by himself. He can detonate the power equivalent of an atomic bomb over anywhere in the world. He can heal all wounds instantly. He can raise the dead. But he is not very good at pushing a square inch block across a floor so clearly he\u2019s a flawed character.\\n\\n\r\nWhen you're main character's as perfect as this, there's no tension.\\n\r\nTatsuya resolves problems without any effort and without any trouble. Any danger that is presented in the series is meaningless as he overcomes it with ease.\\n\r\nMahouka likes to fake danger, like it has some factors against him. It doesn't.\\n\r\nThat's just meaningless words that mean nothing at the end of the day.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime loves to over-explain every little thing. The Light Novel is so riddled with this issue to the point that there are pages upon pages of explanation of something he did like 10-15 pages ago.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters constantly discuss magic and barely anything else, there's no chemistry between any character cause of that. Every single character interaction feels forced.\\n\r\nHell, Tatuya would walk about 2 meters and go into a massive explanation of why it was sooo hard for him. The show loves to make it seem like he sacrifices something for everything he does or that he puts negative effects on his body. But as I said, that's all just words. It's not like that, he doesn't act like anything negative affects him and in the end it doesn't affect him or anything else around him thus it means they're just pointless words.\\n\\n\r\nAnd you know what's appaling? All these huuuge info dumps do not build anything about the lore.\\n\r\nThey're like gigantic text books that teach you the magic... come the f*ck on, that's something the character should learn, not me, go on with the freaking story.\\n\\n\r\nWhat these magical explanations also do is make Mahouka very dull to look at. The vast majority of the show is still frames of talking with no artistic quality put into their presentation. The magical fights are just as boring and dull and have no choreography whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nNot only is Mahouka extremely bland visually, it doesn't have good animation either but the music is forgettable as hell.\\n\\n\r\nThe whole thing is boring and extremely flawed... and all of countless flaws derive from only 1 character... and that's the protagonist. That means they're going to be present forever until the protagonist somehow magically changes.\\n\\n\r\nAre you all wondering why I barely mentioned any plot progression? THERE IS NONE! THE PLOT BARELY PROGRESSES! ALL THESE INFO DUMPS MAKE IT SEEM LIKE ALOT OF IMPORTANT DIALOGUE HAS BEEN SAID BUT NOTHING OF THAT SHIT IS IMPORTANT.\\n\\n\r\nThe explanations for their powers are non-sensical. Doesn't matter how much you try to make it seem scientifically possible... it's not. SO GO ON QUICKLY ABOUT IT AND STOP WASTING MY TME!\\n\\n\r\nMaybe I should mention something about the other characters?\\n\r\nTHEY'RE ALL STUPID ARCHETYPES USED IN EVERY LIGHT NOVEL.\\n\r\nA character is usually that, an archetype who is made unique by having many more traits besides the archetype he/she is.\\n\r\nNow let's say that the characters in Mahouka are just the archetype, without any of the additional traits. That's how bad the characters are. I didn't care about any of them and completely forgot about some even.\\n\r\nOh, also, his sister is also in love with him, that's to further imply how incredibly awesome he is. -_-\\n\r\n(I based this review of 5camp's really good review, because of that some sentences might be strikingly similar but I also gave some of my opinions on why I hate this piece of ass anime).\\n\\n\r\nOverall this show is bad in every possible way and I give it 2/10.",

Whether it is an anime, light novel or manga, we can't deny that this anime is a combination with bits and pieces from \"Harry Potter\" and James Bond sagas, and frankly, the series' combination of Sci-fi with magic wasn't bad except that it lacks one thing........and yes, it lacks a formidable antagonist, also there is the geo-political thing added to this anime where it indirectly concerns Japan's  current conflict with China. But enough of thatas I present my ratings for this anime:\\n\\n\r\nStory:  Fair 6.\\n\\n\r\nOk, high rating is for the anime's story plot where from the first arc involves the conflict between the Blooms and the weeds, where I like the part that them \"Blooms\" got owned by a weed in Tatsuya, however, as the first arc ends the second arc wasn't a bit exciting because the main character become one of the blooms and all of the sudden the conflict between the weeds and the blooms were forgotten. Another thing about the story plot was the fact that it has that geopolitical theme that was present on the last two arc where it indirectly concerns Japan's current conflict with China as I've mentioned, as if writer Tsutomu Sat\u014d was trying to put his nationalist thought into it in which in my opinion is unbecoming of the latter. Ok, so I do enjoy this anime's action-combine with magic and sci-fi, however I just couldn't fathom the fact that in this series where magic is turn into rocket science, which is not bad except that more emphasis was given to most of the blooms and little for them weeds, which is the reason why this part should be fair enough co'z it ain't that good but ain't that bad either.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: Pathetic 1.\\n\\n\r\nOk, so my question is  what's up with the granny dress that them First High schools were wearing? Now, this is probably the only anime where there isn't much moe in it, where the schools girls wear what can be describe as nun- attire and the boys who wears nerdish coat, generally speaking I just don't like the school attire that the characters wore.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good 7.\\n\\n\r\nBasically, the score is for the closing theme in the last arc and the 1st opening theme that I like. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Poor 3.\\n\\n\r\nWhether it is an anime, light novel or manga, on thing is for sure.....that everything was put on the siblings and they are not other than Tatsuya and Miyuki, frankly the two obviously have an incest relationship and there is no denying it. I gave this part a poor score since at first, Tatsuya being able to owned them blooms was exciting, however he becomes a disappointment when he becomes one of the blooms despite of being a weed, though, for him to be this top dog isn't bad, but, he lacks one thing and yes he lacks a formidable opponent and I'm talking about an antagonist who has the capability to kick him hard and make him suffer, unfortunately his portrayal as an protagonist who is the best was seemingly a one side affair where it gets boring when he can kick his enemy's ass like hot knife to butter. It isn't just limited to him where it also includes the entire student council as well who also have their share of being able to defeated an enemy in a snap that also adds to the boring stuff, however the only consultation here is Miyuki whose allure and sweetness keeps ones boredom of this anime at bay.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Decent 4.\\n\\n\r\nDespite of the predictability that the protagonist can defeat the antagonist in a snap, it was still enjoyable enough to finish it up to the last episode, but only barely.l\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Poor 3.\\n\\n\r\nIMO, writer Tsutomu Sat\u014d should have not put any geopolitical theme in this series, also, since the latter didn't put his main character in such hard predicament and by making him have such godlike abilities really proves to be a drag which is why this anime deserves a poor score. Another reason why this anime (including the manga and the LN) should have a 3 was the fact that the title alone as I've mention was misleading, since how the heck can the main character (Tatsuya) be an irregular when he is suppose to be high school student and not someone working a part-time job in some cafe or restaurant, also it wasn't clear as how writer Tsutomu Sato defines 'Irregular\" in his work title,which is one more reason why I gave  this anime a low score.",

            "content": "Mahouka is the worst anime I've ever watched. I finished it just to be able to say this with no doubts.\r\nThe story... well there's no story. There's Tatsuya killing everyone and being flattered by his blind followers. If there's any plot there, you just don't care. The slow pace and flat characters make you forget that there's somethign actually happening.\r\nThe art was the only reason I started to watch this bomb, it looked good... But in the end it wasn't. Repetitive school uniforms, all the students have the same faces, there's little to no facial expressions in any character, the scenery looks always the sameplace. There's also a lot of fanservice boobs.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is some horrible random electronic pop everytime. OPs and EDs completely forgettable. The voices are emotionless and drowsy.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the worst thing I've ever seen in a work of fiction. There's the Mary Sue & Gary Stu couple of perfect protagonists who don't suffer anything bad in the whole series, to the point I wanted to throw a brick on the screen. Or maybe an entire wall of bricks. The others students are a bunch of clones of one another. No importance, little to no personal traits and personality, no backstory, no desires. The only thing they do is to flatter and love Tatsuya onii-sama just because he breathes. The women are the worse: they're all in love with Tatsuya for no reason. And they show it by rubbing their boobs on him. Miyuki is a ridiculously flat and conservative younger sister whose only function is to repeat 'oniiiiii-samaaa' infinitely and then blush. And there's the incest thing, ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww. Also, Mahouka has a very conservative morality, especially for its women, what is ridiculous when you see their boobs popping on the screen. That's just sexism.\\n\\n\r\nThere's no enjoyment. The pace is so slow you can skip 3 or 4 episodes and see that you haven't lost anything important (as if there was something important in Mahouka at all). The whole series could be made in a movie. It would be less painful. 5 anime episodes would be enough to tell the whole thing. I. Am. Not. Kidding. The fights are just random pop playing in the background, extremely boring explanations on magic execution and some guys flying when Tatsuya sneezes at them. When you get to episode 8 or 9 and see this for the 54th time, congratulations! You've seen all of Mahouka. No point getting to the end, that's it.\\n\\n\r\nMahouka wins a lot of trophies: Is the worst anime I've ever watched. Tatsuya is the worst character I've ever seen, and his sister is the second in the list. The soundtrack is also in my list of the most boring ones. See? It's a very prized anime! C'mon, lose your time and watch it!",

            "content": "Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei (translated as The Irregular at Magic High School) isn\u2019t entirely what I see as irregular. Nothing too irrational happens throughout the course of the show and the majority of the cast doesn\u2019t have that \u201cit\u201d factor. Rather, Mahouka does have something we won\u2019t see regularly because of there is magic at high school, or more specifically the Private Magic University Affiliated High School. It\u2019s here where we meet the main characters and siblings - Tatsuya Shiba and his sister Miyuki Shiba. And with their enrollment sets forth this story at an irregular high school where regular things happen and sometimes doesnot. \\n\\n\r\nAdapted from the light novel of the same name written by Tsutomu Sato, the series takes place in a more advanced future in the year of 2095. In this world, magic exists as a sort of technology for both utility and weapons of war. Essentially, the series depicts the setup of the prequel with the aftermath of a world war. And now, magic reigns as dominant source of power. In fact, its concept is held so high in regard that students are separated into classes based on their scores, performances, and skills based on their magic. But hey, it\u2019s a school so students still attend it regularly but with magic as an additional element. Yet, Mahouka has an irrational pacing when adapting its story. By irrational, I don\u2019t mean it as inconsistency but rather by execution. It doesn\u2019t fully come to life when it tells the story and unfortunately lacks a bite to take in what people may expect.\\n\\n\r\nThe first episode doesn\u2019t blast off well. It lacks any sort of wow factor and feels lifeless at hand. Instead, what you get is a mass amount of info dumping regarding the setting and some basic concepts of the series. Rather than telling though, the series explains it in packages. This first arc (known as the Enrollment Part 1 adapted from volume 1 of the light novel) is more like a genre mashup with an overly emphasis that almost forces the viewers to understand every piece of the premise. And to do it that way, they also introduce the majority of the main characters. Besides the Shiba siblings, a host of other characters including ones from the student council make their debut. We don\u2019t know much about them besides their position, some bits of their personality, and in essence a weak general perspective of how we might be interested in them. Then, there\u2019s the weak world building in the first arc with a mass amount of exposition of the mechanics involving the series\u2019 generics. While generic is fine, the show fails to deliver this with comedy. It could have been humorous or at least tried with some attempt at jokes. Even fan service could\u2019ve helped here in some respect. Instead, what you get is pseudo-incest undertones between the siblings. Actually, looking at it from a more perspective angle, it\u2019s often Miyuki that takes the initiative to please her \u201coniisama\u201d. \\n\\n\r\nI wouldn\u2019t say the show is about a cast of characters learning magic. In fact, the series\u2019 story arcs adapt them and give each character some sort of role. However on many occasions, their roles chokes up the plot with their gimmicks. Besides Miyuki\u2019s borderline obsession with her beloved brother, she literally has little to no personality. We don\u2019t learn much about her past either as characterization is fairly weak throughout the entire series. And since the show doesn\u2019t adapt a specific volume from the light novel, we don\u2019t see much else about her from a personal perspective. Regardless, the siblings\u2019 relationship is polarizing as they lack chemistry. Their personalities aren\u2019t compatible and it\u2019s hard to relate to them by any term of realism. In fact, a viewer could easily dictate the duo as a couple. It\u2019s indirectly implied that Miyuki does have forbidden feelings for her brother. Not to mention the fact, many characters makes jokes about their couple-like status. And when that happens, Miyuki\u2019s clich\u00e9 denial and Tatsuya\u2019s indifference obliterates any sort of humor from itself. As for Tatusya though, he has a strict personality with sometimes an authoritative tone when he speaks to others. His commanding presence feels unwelcoming on occasions and can be seen as a man of few words. The way he behaves around others suggests that he lacks an ability to feel strong emotions towards others. (this is in fact true as revealed) However, all of these factors aren\u2019t what\u2019s noticeable about Tatsuya. What Tatsuya brings into the show is in fact his overpowered abilities and skills as a student. Despite failing a practical exam and his inability to use unconventional magic, he has several traits that makes him stand out on a technical basis. The show reveals this during certain situations that becomes obvious as he shows more and more of his skills. Unfortunately, his lack of characterization makes Tatsuya as more of a stale character. There\u2019s little development or focus on him as a person rather than his roles during each arc. In retrospect, Tatsuya is a character that some people might admire for his abilities but hard to appreciate or understand.\\n\\n\r\nBased on a light novel, there\u2019s a certain incentive to adapt everything that fans will be eager to see. As a light novel reader, I can only say that it barely reaches moderate levels when it comes to adaptation. It does adapt some of its main concepts well but fails to reach entertainment levels. The prominent \u201cNine Schools Competition Arc\u201d (NSC) stretches over 10 episodes and introduces many new concepts and characters. While it explores the concepts in their world quite well by actually showing on occasions, it doesn\u2019t do well when it comes with more of its dynamic moments. Most of the games feels relatively fast with the basics and predictable outcomes. Only certain characters stand out despite their already established reputations. Of course, Miyuki and Tatsuya are key players. Other characters that earned a spotlight includes Erika Chiba, Mizuki Shibata, Shizuku Kitayama, and Katsuto Jyumonji. However, their spotlights doesn\u2019t last enough and some are easily forgettable. In essence, their lack of characterization makes them look flat and 1-dimesional with little hope of development. At the same time, don\u2019t forget competition. When it comes to competition, Tatsuya is the epitome of power that only seems to rivaled by a member of another school by the name of Masaki Ichijo. Unfortunately, it\u2019s hard to appreciate their rivalry since the buildup is weak with poorly constructed tropes such as Masaki\u2019s crush on Tatusya\u2019s sister. (no, it\u2019s not even a love triangle since none of the three has any sort of chemistry). It\u2019s just probably best to take it to face value with what the competition as to offer when it focuses on the games themselves. The positive is that there are various games that are offered with interesting concepts during this NSC arc. Not only that but there is also bits of outside jeopardy that becomes intertwined with events of this arc in which viewers might be interested. Similarly, the final arc of the series also has more mature themes with a serious feeling. This should be taken for granted though since the show does take itself seriously. There\u2019s little room for jokes whether it tries die-hardly or not on most occasions.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing to praise Mahouka is perhaps the amount of mechanics are explored. The basis of the CAD (Casting Assistant Device) is presented with great depth throughout the course of the show in various ways. The Nine School Competitions Arc focuses more on its show\u2019s mechanics with new forms of magic such as flight. At its core, Mahouka deals fairly well with its technical aspects. The info dump answers many of the series\u2019 questions whether it relates to spells, classification of magic, Japanese change in culture, and various political topics. There is also a distinctive form of rivalry when it comes to the \u201cblooms\u201d and \u201cweeds. The blooms are the top 50% of the class while the weeds makes up the latter half. The sense of rivalry reaches to antagonistic levels on most times that may keep viewers at their seats to see what to expect. Finally, while the show has oddly placed comedy, there are moments to laud for when it embraces on its subcultural context. This could be expanded upon its mechanics throughout the show that can be creatively intriguing. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation production falls into the hands of Madhouse. For most parts, the visuals makes sense with the general setting and its tropes. Despite being generic, characters does stand out especially for characters of the student council. Miyuki can also be presented as an ice beauty of sorts. The female characters of the series also wear veils to add a bit of cosmetic design to their outfits. On the other hand, most of the characters\u2019 uniforms looks stale and nothing really memorable. There\u2019s also nothing memorable about Tatsuya\u2019s character design for his stoicism. Beyond that, the school\u2019s design itself is fairly regular despite the series\u2019 title. The only other exceptions includes some of the more detailed and enhanced technology later on throughout the show. Background visuals fills its purpose though when it comes to credibility for its setting. Otherwise, there\u2019s nothing praising about the visuals besides the fact that it makes sense on most parts.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack stands out as a more noticeable feature. Just be aware that the voices can be a sting for the ears when you hear ONIISAMA being said over 10 or 15 times during some episodes. However, certain characters has a well-balanced voice that fits his or her personality. The OP and ED songs of the series is also catchy with some foreshadowing and gags. The OST also has a pleasant tone with what is to offer despite some of it being overused or placed at awkward moments. However, the dialogues of the series is cheesy during the majority course of the show. Not even magic can salvage that.\\n\\n\r\nAfter over prioritizing the mechanics of its setting and magic shenanigans, Mahouka will in the end be an average series vacuumed with its even more mediocre cast of characters. What the show has is this interesting premise but it decides to add toppings on toppings of gimmicks until becomes insufferable. Not that the show is entirely terrible though since a few of the arcs has moments that outshines itself with the competition. But with a lack of appreciable comedy and pseudo-incest tendencies, one has to wonder what the purpose of this show is really about. Maybe it\u2019s not trying to communicate that message since some of the episodes are mindless entertainment with the usual gags. If Michael Bay was to direct this series, the entertainment level would skyrocket through the roofs. In the end, Mahouka wastes a promising premise and cast of characters for what it may be worth.\\n",

            "content": "Pop Quiz: What happens when you take a giant sturdy, steel block and throw rocks at it to try and move it? \r\nIt won't move right? The rocks will all crumble, right? And doing it repeatedly will get frustratingly boring, right? Well that experience would still be more thrilling than watching 26 episodes of The Irregular at Magic High School.\r\nBased on the light novel series of the same name, and animated by Studio Madhouse, Irregular at Magic High School, also known as Mahouka is what happens when a writer completely gives up making an interesting story or cast and instead tries to make their maincharacter, Tatsuya Shiba in the case, be on top of things in every situation imaginable. Since so many of Mahouka's problems exist because of this character, and his existence massively drags down any interesting elements the show might have going for it, let's talk about Tatsuya first. \\n\\n\r\nTatsuya AKA Onii Sama AKA Jesus kun mk 3 times infinity, is completely overpowered in every way possible. The show literally says that: \"there's nobody can surpass you in either studies or martial arts\" in the very first episode. But it gets worse. \\n\\n\r\nHe never loses any fight, never shows any signs of emotional weakness, can weaponize magic to be able to fly before anyone else, has a countermeasure for his opponents moves before they even attack, can take a sniper wound head on and heal instantly, can destroy a magic raven just by looking at it, invade people's psyche, can catch and dissolve multiple bullets shot directly at him, develop new technology for their society in secret/make flawless weapons for everyone at his school, has a radar to see where any person comes from, never misses with his weapon, takes down a terrorist organization from the inside singlehandedly, BRINGS PEOPLE BACK FROM THE DEAD, and most painfully, gets nearly every single one of the many girls in the series, including his sister, to never stop talking about him or even falling for him because of how \"cool\" he is. \\n\\n\r\nThe worst part (no, the worst part is a HORRIBLE plot point that comes out of nowhere in the last three episodes, but the second worst part) is that the show's way of justifying all of this overpoweredness is by saying he does SLIGHTLY worse at moving a heavy block across the floor with his mind than anyone else. This \"weakness\" is only brought up in a vain attempt to convince the audience that God Almighty is not overpowered, and it's never mentioned past this or used as an obstacle in any fight he enters.\\n\\n\r\nWhat Mahouka doesn't get is that intelligent audiences won't think a character who always wins is \"cool\". A character is admired for trying, and then eventually succeeding with more effort. Pixar's first rule of storytelling is \"You admire a character for trying more than their successes\", so in turn, a character who always succeeds gives you no reason to admire them or be invested in their growth. Some of anime's most beloved protagonists like Guts from Berserk, Simon from Gurren Lagann, Edward Elric from Fullmetal Alchemist or Lelouch from Code Geass are ones who don't always succeed, and have to learn to overcome their physical and emotional flaws to grow as people. Nothing of the sort happens with Tatsuya, he starts at Square Infinity and his feats keep growing from there.\\n\\n\r\nNow, having an overpowered protagonist doesn't immediately make a show terrible. A writer could use their overpowered character as a joke and build the show around their strength (One Punch Man), you could make your character fun to watch personality wise (Sora from No Game No Life or Alucard from Hellsing) or have an interesting side cast to make up for the overpowered protagonist (again, Hellsing). But they don't take advantage. Mahouka is solemnly serious the whole show, Tatsuya has a dull expression on his face at all times and never truly emotes, and as I'll get into later, other characters have less character than the rocks thrown at the steel block and are made obsolete in the story.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the story itself, it's suprisingly pretty shallow. In 2095, a sizable portion of the human population has died off, but those remaining learned how to use magic as technology and made schools that have competitions with it. Trite. Enter Tatsuya and his sister Miyuki. Because Tatsuya failed that square inch block test I mentioned earlier, he's put in the lower of the school's two classes, and the early parts of the series are all about Tatsuya being seen as the underdog just for being in the lower class because of that BS test method. There's only one other major character in the lower class, and she's taken out of the plot far too quickly. Tatsuya is far stronger than anyone in their world, let alone the upper class, so it gets really annoying.\\n\\n\r\nOther elements of the story include various terrorist attacks, and a high school competition, and while some ideas for the competitions are creative like Magic Bat and the Surf Races, they aren't fun story wise because Tatsuya's overpoweredness transfers to everyone on his team at \"First High School\". Wow. What creativity there in the naming. One of the dumbest scenes in the show (and that says a lot) involves one girl in First High School crying her eyes out for losing in the finals of an event, which might've worked if it was against another school, but it's against the girl's own teammate! She has no reason to cry because their school wins anyway!\\n\\n\r\nOne interesting thing the show does attempt to do is create its very own magic system with lots of types and intricacies, but they also fail because their system of blending magic with technology is incredibly confusing or it's only used to justify Tatsuya winning a fight through technobabble and info dumping. It's unimportant and important in the same story which never works. Something like RWBY, where the characters have two magic powers a piece and their own technology makes it much more clear and practical. Aura for defense, Semblance for a unique power. Mahouka doesn't need such a complex and confusing magic system to make the fights interesting, and no matter how easy the system might've been, it doesn't matter because how strong Tatsuya and his team are compared to everyone else. \\n\\n\r\nNothing is interesting in the story beyond that. Even the various side character subplots brought to fill up the runtime mean nothing in terms of relevance or even development for most of them. How could you make a cool idea about military grade magic weapons into a cliche high school not-harem Jesus fantasy?! It's lazy, cheap, incredibly full of itself, frustrating and boring, and no amount of polished looking techno animation can save it.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the animation, it's not bad, but really doesn't have much to work with. By Studio Madhouse, all of the character designs have a nice polish to them and unique faces with well inserted lips, and the character animation is fairly smooth and consistent. Even some of the technical explanations have very Tron-esque backgrounds that fit the style of the show well. But at the same time, it feels wasted on being given so little to work with. The backgrounds are, for the most part, very unoriginal and standard with little to distinguish them from other future city series, the choreography can occasionally be very flat (in one case literally being two characters walking at each other to shoot each other with guns really slowly), some character designs don't fit for their gender or feel unoriginal, and the flat directing leaves a lot of times where characters are positioned in rooms at very basic angles. Overall, the animation is good, but held back by the source material's lack of anything interesting to animate. Even Guilty Crown, bad as it was story wise, at least had some creative designs and ways to use their animation.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is a similar story. Rising Hope is a solid OP, but it can't hold a candle to LiSA's other song Crossing Field. The first ED and second OP aren't very memorable, but the second ED is actually very nice. In the series, the OST mostly consists of techno and dubstep themes, which aren't really bad but very unmemorable. So overall an OK soundtrack, but what puts it at a 5 is the rather bland delivery from most of the voice actors, and Miyuki's constant need to say \"Onii sama\" over and over again in the dialogue. It gets rather annoying, even if that's more the fault of the script and her \"character\".\\n\\n\r\nAs as characters in Mahouka, everyone in this show is either bland, one note, or a missed opportunity. And there is 0.1% character development whatsoever in 26 episodes. \\n\\n\r\nI've already talked enough abou Tatsuya, but I'd like to add that making him emotionless  only feels like a lazy decision to not have him react to anything and not to actually show subtle character change (Oreki Houtarou from Hyouka). Now to everyone else.\\n\\n\r\nMiyuki Shiba- Tatsuya's sister. Not only the worst character in this anime, but one of the worst characters in any anime ever. And this is coming from someone who watched Mirai Nikki and Guilty Crown. Her only character trait is incest. You heard that right, the ONLY character trait Miyuki has in 26 episodes is loving her brother, being clingy to him, and getting all rosy red cheeks every time he's nice to her. She even rolls around in her bed basically orgasming over him once. It's not even delved into. Even Sword Art Online did a better job handling an incest plot because we actually got to see Suguha's inner thoughts and how she learns to get over it. Here, it exists to be incest, and no other reason. She looks cute, loves her brother, and is the most pure, precious, literal special snowflake with her ice powers. Honestly she's a worse character than Tatsuya! Because at least with Tatsuya, we could understand why he acted the way he did, but with Miyuki we get nothing. The most memorable thing about her is her constantly saying \"Onii-sama\" over and over and over again nonstop. For being the second most important character in your show, this is absolutely pathetic.\\n\\n\r\nNot-Suzaku- I'm serious, the show literally just stole his character design. Basically he's Tatsuya's rival as indicated by the OP. His first appearance had me curious about what type of character he would be as he stood in a room with blood all over the walls, and he had a weapon that kills people just like Kira in Jojo Part 4. I thought he would be some sort of Face of an Angel, Mind of a Demon type character who'd encounter Tatsuya many times and be some sort of diabolical mastermind but NOPE! Mets Tatsuya a grand total of once, fails like a chump, and then he turns into the most generic Pok\u00e9mon rival possible, with whom Tatsuya lets his sister dance with. You had an interesting idea and then you completely forgot about it. WHY?!!!!\\n\\n\r\nErika Chiba- A tomboyish girl with a very teasing personality with a relationship to her brother and a mentor to another character. While by no means a good character, she's the ONLY character in Mahouka to have something resembling a personality and at points she was the most fun character to watch. That said, it's the difference between a two dimensional character with a cast of one dimensional characters, but an achievement for how little it may be.\\n\\n\r\nMibu Sayaka- I brought her up because she's the character who has that 0.1% of character development I mentioned earlier, by realizing that it wasn't right to turn against the High School for their class discrimination based on one test. She could've been a much better candidate for representing the underdog theme, but the show thought it was better to ignore her for the rest of the run save for one tiny moment later, and make Tatsuya the underdog in a laughably bad display. Just another missed opportunity by Mahouka...\\n\\n\r\nNo one else is even worth talking about. All of the other girls do is look cute, stick to an archtype and talk about how cool Tatsuya is. Heck, one girl terrorist literally tries to hack into the First High School system JUST to get Tatsuya to notice her. All the other guys do is make you wish any one of them was the protagonist instead of Tatsuya. The villains are absolutely pathetic, being nothing more than the most one dimensional terrorists and gang leaders and leaving NO impression.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, a horribly unmemorable and generic cast of characters, and those who are memorable aren't exactly well known for good reason.\\n\\n\r\nAfter 26 episodes of watching Mahouka, the payoff was nothing more than a sigh of relief that it was finally over and I could add another series to my Completed list. So in conclusion,\\n\\n\r\n+Overall smooth animation and polished character designs \\n\r\n+First OP and second ED (which aren't even because of the show itself) \\n\r\n+Cool Techno Sequences \\n\r\n+Some decent ideas for Magic Games \\n\r\n+Ends with a bang...courtesy of God Almighty\\n\r\n+Erika is passable but...\\n\\n\r\n-AWFUL main characters: Tatsuya is invulnerable emotionless GOD and Miyuki has less character than a rock \\n\r\n-Horribly generic and unmemorable side characters with absolutely no development \\n\r\n-Fails at the underdog theme so hard that it's laughable \\n\r\n-All important information is given through info dumps \\n\r\n-Villains are the most generic terrorists possible \\n\r\n-Fanservice so pointless you wonder why it exists \\n\r\n-Incest for no reason besides Incest. \\n\r\n-Animation has very little to work with\\n\r\n-Side character plots that literally exist just to fill time \\n\r\n-Manages to be boring and frustrating at the same time \\n\r\n-Stupidly overcomplicated Magic System \\n\r\n-Wastes every good idea it has \\n\r\n-Completely tensionless at every point\\n\\n\r\nSCREW THIS SHOW.\\n",

In psychoanalytic theory, the satisfaction of a desire, need, or impulse through a dream, fantasy, or other exercise of the imagination.\"\r\nI've never written a review before, so I hope this proves helpful to ya'll! For this review, I'm going to be talking about an anime that I watched for quite a different reason than probably most other people. To explore this, I'm gonna go over all the major categories - hopefully, by the end of this review, you'll have a helpful understanding of the pros and cons ofthis anime! Please keep in mind that I've watched the anime up to it's most recent episode (14), and I've not read the LN, although I have looked up some info on the wiki to clarify some points. I'll do my best to keep this spoiler free.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 4\\n\r\nBy itself, the story isn't bad. In fact, if you were to remove the male and female MCs, the story would probably shine. However, story and character are inevitablely inseparable, and thus must be judged in light of each other.\\n\\n\r\nI personally found the story to be engaging. The first arc flowed well enough, and the second one is also doing a fair job of keeping my attention. People have said there are pacing issues, but I haven't really found this to be the case. Worldbuilding (especially the magic system) has been done really well - it's very obvious that a lot of care and detail went into the world to make it work so logically and tacitly. The lore is very interesting, and I genuinely want to know more about the world of Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei as the show goes on. Then again, there are a HUGE number of plot holes as well. A lot of the show seems to have been made up for the purpose of plot and convenience, and so a lot of things don't make sense. Here's a short list:\\n\r\n1) Why does First High have a First and Second Course program? Only the Firsts get magic trainers, but to enroll at the magic-oriented university in the first place, you have to be exceptionally good at magic. That's like saying a typical university takes only people who get 35s and 36s on the ACT, but only provides classes and instructors to those who got the 36s, and everyone else gets to take Shop classes forever.\\n\r\n2) Why is the Bloom and Weed discrimination only perpetuated by a few of the cardboard cutout characters (which is discussed below)? I thought it was supposed to be a school-wide problem?\\n\r\n3) Why even HAVE a Nine Schools Competition when First High has the absolute best magicians? Like, this isn't a matter of subjective opinion - First High only accepts the absolute best. This competition is desperately trying to mimic the Tri-Wizard Tournament from Harry Potter, but in HP, it made sense. After all, the British magic people went to the British school, the French magic people went to the French school, etc. In Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei, this is not the case. And indeed, as we see, First High can only lose due to repeated (um, where are the referees?) sabotage due to hostile third parties.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, a HUGE problem is that there is nothing at stake in the story. Since both the male and female MCs are so insanely good at pretty much everything they do (with a few exceptions), nothing is being risked at any point. There's no uncertainty over what'll happen, there's no fear for the MCs' safety, and more unfortunately, there's no unpredictability. Everything is painfully obvious from the get-go. While other animes with OP MCs will at least throw them into some peril, this is absolutely not the case in Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei. Fights are over in under ten seconds each (which isn't bad, but there's no emotional involvement as a result, especially since the MCs always win), and dangerous situations happen to others or are also resolved in under ten seconds.\\n\\n\r\nSuspension of disbelief is one thing, but when I know what's gonna go down even before the episode happens, then there's no reason to care much for what's going to happen. This is due to the MCs, which I'll discuss in a little bit.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nThis, honestly, is one of the show's two strongest points. Everything is gorgeous, the magic looks fantastic, and the animation never dips even when action is scarce. A lot of love went into making this world look and feel fantastic, and the vibrancy of the world is truly a pleasure to behold.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nMany people seem to judge a show on the OP and ED, but I personally skip OPs and EDs to avoid spoilers, so I'll be judging Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei by the actual sound. Which is fantastic as well. All of the effects are crisp and visceral - the pops pop deliciously, the crackles crackle with fervor, and overall, the sound does a phenomenal job of bringing the world to life.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 1\\n\r\nThis brings me to the biggest problem of the anime, and the reason for my original dictionary quote at the beginning of this review. Every. Single. Character. Is flatter than a sheet of paper. And while the male MC does have an intricate backstory, his overwhelming ability annihilates any interest I might have in him. But even worse than this is the way everyone treats him. As a writer myself, it's very hard to avoid making a Gary Stu; due to the fact that we as writers want to write what is most natural to us (ourselves), and we want to live adventures that are only possible for our characters. So writing yourself into a super awesome character is very easy to do.\\n\\n\r\nThis does not make it excusable.\\n\\n\r\nEVERY. SINGLE. PERSON. In the anime absolutely ADORES the male MC (except for his rivals, of course). And they take EVERY. SINGLE. OPPORTUNITY. To tell him how awesome he is. I'm not exaggerating on this. The MC gets complimented (and I don't mean a \"good job\" kind of compliment, but a \"you are so amazing I wish I were dating you or better friends with you or more like you\" type of compliment) OVER and OVER and OVER and OVER and OVER. At least 2-5 times per episode. And yes, the male MC is superpowered, but that doesn't justify the kind of foot-worshiping we see in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOn a base level, this becomes aggravating and wearying very, very quickly. But on a deeper level, it takes an unfortunate chunk out of the story. Without giving away too much, there's one point in the anime where the male MC does something absolutely extraordinary by completely revolutionizing a concept previously thought impossible. In any other anime, this would be grounds for the MC to be amazing and for your admiration of that MC to grow. However, due to the constant barrage of incredible feats the male MC consistently performs in Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei, this major revolution comes across as flat. Stale. Uninteresting. There's no room for significant praise when such praise has been unendingly heaped on the male MC from episode 1. This is a very clear example of severe wish fulfillment.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the female MC, she's about as deep a character as a puddle of water. And she has about the same amount of charm too. Her main purpose, aside from PWNING N00BS, is to ceaselessly praise and talk up to the male MC. Like, ALL the time. In the second episode, she is given a great honor, but instead of accepting it graciously, she throws a fit that the male MC isn't being recognized for his awesomeness instead. And actually, she does that in episode 1 too. And in other episodes. This female MC only backs down when given a commanding nod from the male MC, which clearly means he is her superior in every regard. This is also a very bad case of wish fulfillment.\\n\\n\r\nThis wouldn't be so bad if she was a servant or indebted to the male MC somehow, but the kicker is that she's... his sister. His younger sister. I get that sibling relationships are supposed to be good, but the male MC is clearly the female MC's idol. I'm not even gonna talk about the incest between them, which this anime clearly is in favor of. Such incest is a design choice, and so I'm willing to accept it as part of the story. But the female MC's foot-licking toward her older brother comes off as possessive and creepy.\\n\\n\r\nPeople relate to characters who have flaws, and despite the desperate assertions of Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei, neither of the MCs have any real flaws. The male MC's absolute lack of emotions could be considered a flaw, but the fact that everyone still loves him regardless means that it really isn't a flaw. The male MC's lack of skill in a certain area of magic could be considered a flaw, but the fact that he still is insanely OP means that it really isn't a flaw. The male MC's social aloofness could be considered a flaw, but the fact that he's described as absurdly handsome and a chick-magnet means that it really isn't a flaw. Etc.\\n\\n\r\nAs for every other character, I genuinely can't remember a single name of anybody else. And I'm usually pretty good with names. The only exception would be Ririka (or something like that - I could look it up, but then again, this is a great example of how underdeveloped the other characters are) - she actually comes off as interesting and slightly multifaceted compared to the other characters. Then again, that's not saying much in this anime, but regardless, she serves as a breath of fresh air in an otherwise lifeless and stale list of cardboard cutout characters whose only purpose is to populate the much more interesting world of Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and the villains are overwhelmingly under-established. They have poor motivations, awful direction, and almost no planning. What were the villains up to in the first section of this anime? Something about magic and equality? Something relating to terrorism? I'm not quite sure. And as for the villains in the second part? That hasn't been revealed yet, so I honestly can't comment. But it seems like a persona vendetta against the MCs' school, which also doesn't make sense.\\n\\n\r\nBut I've gone on this for long enough.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2\\n\r\nI really, really wanted to like this. I very much did. The magic system is remarkable and impressive, and the world itself is interesting and engaging. But absolutely abysmal characters, non-existent character development, and a mundanely routine plot served to detract sharply from any charm the world might have had on its own. What truly sinks the ship, however, is the flattery of the male MC. While this might seem as nitpicking, it happens on such an exaggerated and persistent level that it honestly causes me to literally moan aloud every time the male MC is worshiped by his fans (which happens multiple times per episode). It's so forced and jarring that it kills any immersive qualities Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei might otherwise have, and it causes me to constantly look to see how much more of the episode is left to go. If the ridiculous and never-ending compliments were removed, as well as the obsessive sister MC, this show would be much, much, much, much, much more enjoyable.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3\\n\r\nThe art is awesome, and the sound is phenomenal. But the awful and wooden characters, the lack of any character development whatsoever, and the completely predictable story serve to tank what could have otherwise been an impressive and fun anime. Overall, all the ingredients for success are found here, but absolutely nothing good is done with them. Instead, negative elements are thrown in - meaning that in the end, like with an uncooked cake, all you have left to eat is a soppy, flower and sugar and egg goop that has been further poisoned with toxic nuclear waste. An extreme statement, I know, but hey - at least it's on par with the compliments given to the male MC, albeit in a negative manner instead of a worshipful one.",

            "content": "- This Review Contains Spoilers -\r\nI'm not entirely sure why I watched all of Mahouka. At some point it was a scholarly interest in why this was the latest hottest thing in light novels. It might have been because people said it gets better in the novels later and I wondered at what stage that would be. At another point it was purely to see if I could finish it as a personal challenge. If I could keep watching I might be able to find something good about this anime. Something that at the end of the day I could say \"sure it was mostlybad, but there was this one thing about the show that was enjoyable\".\\n\\n\r\nI never found that thing. I can find nothing to recommend about Mahouka. It is bad on pretty much every level.\\n\\n\r\nThe first point it fails at, and the main point that drags down the entire show, is the main character. Tatsuya Shiba is a highly talented magician who has been placed in the crappy kids class. He's there because he is bad at pushing a square inch wooden block across a floor with his mind. This is the only thing he is bad at in the world of magic. He is a master magician who can cancel out other magicians magic. He's baffling intelligent to the point that he can calculate mind-bogglingly complex magical problems in milliseconds. In his spare time he's the world's greatest engineer, fronting as the mysterious Silver creating the best magical equipment in the world. He solves magical problems that the rest of the world have been struggling with for years. He creates the power of flight on a whim. He can see through walls. He can take down an entire platoon of terrorists by himself. He can detonate the power equivalent of an atomic bomb over anywhere in the world. He can heal all wounds instantly. He can raise the dead. But he is not very good at pushing a square inch block across a floor so clearly he's a flawed character.\\n\\n\r\nWhen your main character is as perfect as this, there is no tension. There is no struggle. Any problem presented to Tatsuya can be solved with no issue. Yet the show likes to pretend he genuinely has factors against him. It's purely lipservice though that has no practical limitations on his capability to do literally anything. Whenever the show tries to make me feel like Tatsuya is inconvenienced, it ends up flipping around and making me feel like I should be on the side of the people against Tatsuya. It got to the point that for long periods of the show I found it easier to treat Tatsuya like he was the villain.\\n\\n\r\nYou know that big Darwinian speech given by Charles Vi Brittania from Code Geass where he goes on about how the strong will destroy and subjugate the weak and that's why everyone will bow down to Brittania and all hail Brrrrrrrrritannia? That's Tatsuya's, and by extension the author's outlook on life. Except when Charles delivers his speech about the myth of equality, it's by Norio Wakamoto hamming it up to 11 as the most evil character in the world. In Mahouka it's Tatsuya delivering the speech about how equality is a bad thing and we should destroy those who seek to change that, and we're supposed to agree with his outlook.\\n\\n\r\nThe weird thing is, Tatsuya would make a pretty great supervillain. His calm attitude and dangerous intelligence is perfect Bond villain material. He's a cold-blooded killer who wipes out several thousand people without remorse during the show. You can totally do villain as protagonist thing. Light Yagami did a pretty good job of it as a similar smart person with dangerous beliefs and phenomenal power. Tatsuya though is always presented as the hero. All the villains are terrorists, more terrorists, and the Chinese, none of whom are presented as anything other than cardboard cutouts of villains. The first episode shows that the school has a dumb system where less magically talented kids are treated like shit by the upper class of magical students. But instead of coming to the conclusion that the whole system is dumb because it creates a class system, the show comes to the conclusion that the system is bad because it didn't rate Tatsuya highly.\\n\\n\r\nSo we have unstable foundations from which to build this show on, but what about the more superficial presentation angle. Are the magical fights fun? No.\\n\\n\r\nTechnobabble. Magical sequences in the show are interrupted by long explanations of the magical theory behind them. Characters would sit in the cafe and discuss magic. Tatsuya would move a block across a room then launch into a lengthy explanation why this was difficult for him. Tatsuya would explain why wizards flying is really difficult for most of an episode and then proceed to solve it a minute later accompanied by another explanation. I got a pretty good grasp on the world's magic system by the end of the show, but these scenes are all excruciatingly boring even with that knowledge. Eyes glaze over as they talk about oscillating magical frequencies and squiddidly heebijeebies and whatnot. What was even more frustrating is you could use none of this knowledge to enjoy the show more. None of the explanations helped the viewer understanding what was going on in a battle better or let you work out what was going on yourself. Even with the knowledge of magic I gained, it never became useful to know for anything else. It wasn't building lore either since it felt mostly like reading from a highly boring textbook. So what was the point of these lengthy magical explanations?\\n\\n\r\nThe explanation is pretty easy really. You know in Kill la Kill one of the characters would have an explanation as to why Matoi Ryuko gained this incredible power of hers, delving into theories about life fibres and so on, until Mako would burst in and yell \"so what you're saying is Ryuko has awesome powers\", turning the entire previous conversation into a hilarious joke that outlined that none of it was really important? That's Mahouka's magical explanations except it's explaining why Tatsuya is totally awesome. Also it's not played as a joke.\\n\\n\r\nWhat these magical explanations also do is make Mahouka very dull to look at. The vast majority of the show is talking heads with no artistry put into their presentation. The magical fights are equally pretty dull with no interesting fight choreography. In general Mahouka is pretty bland visually and doesn't have great animation either. The music, since I'm on the subject of production values, is also pretty bland. A bunch of generic jpop for OP/ED and insert songs is the most it can muster. The pacing is also awful, in particular during the middle and boringest arc, and again I can attribute this mostly to these Tatsuya-appealing sessions of lengthy magical explanations that ultimately lead to no conclusion beyond Mako yelling \"so what you're saying is Tatsuya is totally awesome right\".\\n\\n\r\nThere's also a whole load of nitpicky problems. One that bugged me was the show's weirdly conservative treatment of women. Tatsuya's sister is madly in love with him, but oddly that didn't bother me too much because it's just another method the show uses to  appeal to Tatsuya. No what I'm referring to is the weird way anytime a woman would wear something other than the most skin-covering clothing, a character would comment on how they should cover up and stop being such a dirty whore. Usually by Tatsuya, because he's a gentleman *tips fedora*. All while the camera pans lovingly up the underdressed woman's skin and makes their boobs really shiny. It's a small thing, but it compounds with lots of other little things that make me really start to resent the author.\\n\\n\r\nI really tried scraping through my memory banks to find something I liked about the show, but I could come up with nothing. I mostly just found more and more nitpicky problems the further I probed. The character designs are bland to the point that I kept mixing up characters. It has too many characters in general and there were a large chunk of them for whom I didn't understand their purpose. That one episode where the student council leader gave a speech during a debate that solved nothing but somehow their opposition thought they were defeated by this incredibly speech. How boring the presentation of the magical sports were and how bloody long they kept showing them. Perhaps the closest I can think of as a good thing about Mahouka is how, by the end, Tatsuya's power goes beyond the point of even self-parody. So what, one wry smile from the whole show, and even that is an ironic one?\\n\\n\r\nHere's a suggestion for you if you're thinking of watching Mahouka. Puff your cheeks out. Now stick your tongue out slightly. Now blow air out of your mouth so it escapes under your tongue. This should cause your tongue to make a rasping noise, not dissimilar to that of a fart. Congratulations. You have now done something more fun that watching Mahouka with about as much artistic merit.",

There are three very crucial aspects to this show that form a fissure among the viewers. If you are able to tolerate or enjoy these aspects, watch this show.

When I say over-powered I mean it in the most literal sense possible. This guy does not lose, ever. He's a genius with combat capabilities surpassing every other personwe encounter within the show. This world practically made him a god. Someone tell Kira to take notes because becoming this guy is how you really conquer the world. You will never have to ponder who will emerge the victor, the contest was won as soon as our hero decided to make his appearance. If this aspect will bother you, DO NOT WATCH THIS SHOW!!! This never proved bothersome to me. I accepted the simple fact that this narrative would have a god in the driver's seat and just enjoyed watching the moments when the other characters realized the true power our protagonist held. \\n\r\nII: Exposition heavy dialogue. The dialogue can be said to bore some people to tears with the snail-like pace it moves at. In this story it's not just that magic exists, no, there is a system to it. This system that is more akin to science than the traditional wizards and wands style. The specifics of this system of magic, it's integration into society, the social standing of those who can use magic, all of it is explored through the dialogue. A fight with magic will occur and the next 10 minutes will be a discussion of the fight.  History, politics, and a magic that behaves as science are all explored in heavy detail. If that sounds monotonous, pass on this title. Personally, I found this fascinating. I loved that the author took time to craft a world filled with detail and societal nuances.\\n\r\nIII: Hints towards an incestuous relationship between the two main characters. With the main characters being an elder brother and sister who are very close, incestuous hints are littered throughout their interactions and thoughts. This never impacted my enjoyment in the slightest, it's a work of fiction, not myself. I can separate my own actions from that of the characters. Not to mention the simple fact that I could not think of any reason as to why incest is fundamentally wrong (potential genetic issues in offspring irrelevant, reproduction not mutually inclusive), but I digress. If you dislike seeing siblings with a relationship that seems to go beyond the standard definition of a sibling relationship, then do not click play on that first episode. \\n\r\nFor all of you who find yourselves unperturbed by the aforementioned elements then by all means, keep reading. Now, onto the standard format for reviewing on this site:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nThis story is far from unique. Two new students showing up to a school and taking an ax to the beliefs and perceptions of the entire student body is nothing new. These siblings arrive and the foundations that everyone believed to be stable are shifted. That being said, I loved the execution of this concept in the world the author created. In my exposition portion I mentioned that this world has an incredible amount of detail to it. Said detail is exactly why I love the idea of shaking the roots society stands upon. The school has a very discriminate social standing that our main characters are able to shatter. \\n\r\nOutside of the school itself we also have the governmental structure of Japan, foreign nations and terrorist groups, etc, etc. These components were all stacked together to build a world that felt real. \\n\r\nThe narrative of this show is arc-based. This shouldn't be surprising given that light novels serve as the source material. The arcs follow a logical sequence of time and progression, so a drastic disconnect between the episodes never seemed to exist. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nThe animation was fantastic. Madhouse once again came through in extraordinary fashion. The movement was fluid which was especially noticeable in the combat scenes. The back-drops were pleasant and the color palette was rich without feeling exceedingly vibrant. \\n\r\nThe character designs are also something I found particularly nice. It's an absolute fact that most men are going to be larger than women. Greater height, broader shoulders, simple size and body mass. Yet all too often this fundamental truth is all but forgotten in the world of anime. But not in this series, no, the characters in this series are for the most part correctly proportioned. This also applies to females in the sense that they weren't erroneously sized in their bust. Not being a fan-service show that may seem to be normal, but even then this show felt real in regards to how the characters were built. The remainder of the character designs (faces, hair, etc, etc) were also pleasant. You won't find exceedingly wacky hair styles or colors. The majority of the main and supporting cast were fairly individualistic in design, but there are a few noticeable exceptions where two characters will appear to be carbon copies of one another. \\n\r\nOh, and a special note: Coolest school uniforms ever. The end.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nThere's not too much I can say in this department. The OST was good, but at the same time it wasn't particularly special. Featuring a lot of techno music each scene was complimented well. \\n\r\nThe voice acting was also solid. The respective actors managed to express the unique qualities of their characters. Their performances weren't too stand-out or deserving of excessive praise, but at the end of the day I could say they did a good job.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\nThis score is probably pretty surprising. I mean, with an over-powered main character there's no way he could actually be a good character, right? Well, this is where I disagree with many people. I am not one to say that \"over-powered\" and \"bad character\" are mutually inclusive terms. They can be synonymous, sure, but no subjective thought could ever be set in stone. Tatsuya Shiba, or as I like to call him - Japan's lord and savior, is a 16 year old genius who comes across as very calm and apathetic. He possesses almost no magical affinity but still shows up at the magic high-school to study as an engineer. His combat capabilities aside, I think Tatsuya is a good character. He may come across as just a boring lump of clay with a sister-complex, but as we come to learn of his dry humor, logical manner of thinking, and direct mannerisms, my perception of him as a character was altered. He never undergoes any sort of development, but we do get insight into his past, learning why he is who he is, discovering why he holds his sister so close to his heart. His emotionless attitude becomes sympathetic, bordering on tragic. \\n\r\nThen we have his sister, Miyuki Shiba. Her character can be summed up as this: \"Onii-sama\". (And get used to that name, you'll hear it a lot.) I kid, I kid, Miyuki harbors extreme love for her brother (so much so that it might as well he obsession), but she does have a few additional aspects that make up her personality. (The name still stands, though. Many, many times will \"Onii-sama\" grace your auditory glands). Miyuki is in part the ideal daughter. She's intelligent, capable, well-spoken, beautiful, her genetics and upbringing ensured she would be nothing but the best. She's also a girl who holds a great deal of resentment towards her family, simultaneously feeling extreme gratitude towards her brother. She has a massive brother complex and most of her actions are taken in an attempt to help her brother or make him proud of her. However, I do think that I am in the minority for finding Miyuki to be an interesting character. The large majority of those who watch this show find her to be bothersome and annoying. But fear not if you happen to be one of those who find her irksome, her initial presentation in the first few episodes changes slightly, accompanied by less screen time as the episodes progress.\\n\r\nThe supporting cast is fairly large. You have the respective councils within the school, the normal students, military personnel, family members of students, etc. None of the supporting cast are particularly deep characters, but I wouldn't classify them as complete cliches either. On first glance these characters will seem to fall into a general archetype. Contrary to that initial perception, however, these characters do not fall into the pitfall that is stereotyping. As I said though, they are lacking in depth. Whilst walking the path of a character, Mahouka's managed to get past the trap of cliches, but stopped short of the bridge of development. One element I loved about the cast on the whole was their perception and strength. Tatsuya will definitely steal the spot-light, but these characters are all skilled in their own regards Some fights they will manage alone, some explanations will come from their own lips. Tatsuya is ultimately the one who will save the day, but prior to his arrival we witness the remarkably adept capabilities of the cast.\\n\r\nA special shout-out for the best girl that is Mayumi Saegusa. The adorable student council president and the only character capable of trolling Tatsuya to the same caliber he trolls others. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nI won't lie, I initially turned this show on after looking up shows with a bad-ass protagonist. I had watched one too many series with a weak male that had to be protected. One too many series where the protagonist was the only character to over-react to a situation. This show was a fulfillment of my wish to not watch a spiky-haired pansy get his ass kicked. I never expected an emotional narrative with compelling themes and deep symbolism, I just wanted a protagonist that would kick ass in a spectacular fashion, and this show delivered. The copious exposition was just a bonus for me who loves detailed world building. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nI loved this show. The sheer amount of \"Holy shit that was awesome\" moments made this show great. From the first episode I never looked to see who would win, I just wanted to see how many jaws Tatsuya could drop when he showed the world how he won.\\n\r\nAll in all, if you want to watch two siblings who love each other very much kick some ass, accompanied by friends that talk about how the two siblings just kicked ass, watch this immediately. \\n",

            "content": "The conception of \"perfection\" we previously had is going to change, because after watching Shiba Tatsuya (the protagonists show) in action, the word we used to describe the type of character which is sightly too powerful among his peers, overpowered, is going to be \"Onii-sama\" from now on. With Shiba Tatsuya, better known as Onii-sama, we reach a level of perfection never seen before in the anime industry, characters we reputed as OP, notable recent examples such as Kirigaya Kazuto (Sword Art Online) or Gilgamesh (Fate/Zero), are practically nothing next to our glorious Onii-sama, capable of turning the Impossible into something actually possible.\r\n> Is aproblem an OP character as main then?\\n\\n\r\nTo that question I reply: \"not necessary\", since an overpowered main character isn't a big iceberg enough to sink an entire ship, we have plot development and side characters after all; and overpowered isn't a synonymous of \" Bad\", sometimes is good to watch a main character that isn't completely a weakling, but problems comes when the plot's development is nothing more than a series of events made to emphasize the greatness of our main characters, plural, because Onii-sama didn't descended from Heaven alone, there is his sister, the main female protagonist, Shiba Miyuki, another example of absolute perfection, to accompany him in his journeys.\\n\\n\r\n> So this is an anime about these perfect couple of siblings and nothing more?\\n\\n\r\nWe aren't that far to describe this show with that phrase up here, but actually there isn't a better phrase to describe this show neither, since the anime I'll now introduce you is going to be the anime with the most perfect main protagonist I've seen in my whole life, and as you've probably noted, the word 'perfect' isn't used with a positive tone in this review. I'll now claim that I haven't read the LN, this is going to be my judgement from what I've seen in this adaptation.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is set on the year 2095 d.c, after the conclusion of the Third World War and the introduction of the Magic System, magician isn't a term anymore related to fairy tails, Science and Technology converged into what we now call Magic. Society developed itself around this new form of Science, and this lead the necessity to create new generations of youngsters capable of crafting this new kind of science, so Magic High Schools were born. This show follows a particular brother and sister, fresh enrolled in the First Magic High School (there are only 9 in the country) at the beginning of the first episode. \\n\\n\r\n\"We're not the same\"\\n\\n\r\nAs everything that isn't \"uniform\" in the Society, it creates a fracture between the population, racism in few words, and Magic is not the exception. Some individuals are more capable of others, that is a fact, and so is also related to Magic. People who show an incredible magic ability form the Course 1 in the High School, and the others, less capable, form the Course 2. Somehow Onii-sama sucked at the enrollment test score and ended in the Course 2, the so called \"Weed\" course, meanwhile Miyuki ended in the Course 1, the \"Bloom\" course. How a perfect being such as Onii-sama ended in the course 2?, that will be explained through the show, something I'll not reveal, let's keep going. Funny fact that actually all Onii-sama's friends, course 2 people, are above the course 1 students in matters of skill combat and magic. This is the classic shounen pattern where all the protagonist's friends are better than everyone else and save the world, with the difference that only Onii-sama is able to save the day here, the rest aren't of any use actually.\\n\\n\r\nIn this 26 episodes adaptation from the best-seller Light Novel, there are adapted three arcs, each of them, naturally, revolving around Onii-sama and his friends dealing with an unexpected conflict, unnaturally always is Onii-sama the center of everything that happens in this show, leading the viewers to ask themselves a such basic question as:\\n\\n\r\n> \"If Onii-sama doesn't want his true identity being revealed, why does he keep trying everything to be in the spotlights every time?\"\\n\\n\r\nSuch a million dollar question sadly didnt get an answer, events just keep happening and Onii-sama always saving the day, in the most perfect possible way. And that just seem to be irony, since a characteristic of this show is that of explaining EVERYTHING, well...at least the things related to magic spells, magic sequences and effects. Practically a huge time was spent on explaining things that aren't real and somewhat irrelevant for the development of the story, time that surely could have been spend in a more useful and productive way.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of characters was surely wide, we have practically a character for every kind of stereotype. There's the glasses girl, the tomboy, the cute and moe girl, the silent girl, the tusndere, the Student Council President, the best protagonist's friend, the bad guy who didn't accept the protagonist but later he accepts him, the rival, ect ect ect. Actually none of them had an important role in this show, since its all about Onii-sama, but we're able to find something in common between them, possibly the only reason why the author decided to create side characters for this show, and that would be: \"to praise Onii-sama and his sister\". Actually that may sound like a joke but believe me when I tell you it isn't, every single side character in every single episode, when they aren't wasting time explaining Magic related things, that remaining time is spend on praising Onii-sama for x, y and z reason, a fact that I found overly above the ridiculous level.\\n\\n\r\nBy the other side there's no need to spend a lot of words for our sibling protagonists, there's only a word capable of containing all their essences, 'Perfect'. Onii-sama is good at everything possible imaginable, every presented female character falls for him but he doesn't have eyes for any of them, because Onii-sama cares a lot about his sister, and that was stated several times through the show. Meanwhile Miyuki is his female counterpart, a beautiful young girl which excels in Magic and in everything she does, I'll just end here to write about them, since my writing skills are way too far of being perfect to describe this pair of siblings in the proper way.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to Animation and Sound, at least, this anime isn't mediocre, animation is made by Madhouse, characteristic trademark of this studio is the high quality animation of its adaptations. The actions scenes were quite fluid and very well done, camera angles and sudden zoom ins and zoom outs were coordinated very well, as well as the OST fitting them, electric-rock oriented, we can't say its perfect as our protagonists but we can say its done quite well, above average for sure. OPs and EDs were quite nice, Rising Hope by LiSA was by far my favorite song from this show.\\n\\n\r\nAt some point of this show I couldn't take seriously anything that was happening, too much perfection, events emphasized to show how great the Shiba siblings were, too much useless explanations, pathetic side characters, and a lot of details I didn't mention because they're spoilers, overall is a quite interesting anime that shows how would be to have a perfect MC gaining the praise for each side character presented, something completely original I must say, nothing that I've seen come close to what I've seen in this anime but this is not surely something I would feel to recommend to people.",

            "content": "Set in 2095, magic is now a form of technology and science. After the 3rd world war, magic wielders were high in demand in the world to defend their individual countries from further chaos. Mahouka follows two siblings, Tatsuya and Miyuki Shiba, who are enrolled in Fist High School. Based on enrolment test scores, the brother becomes a Weed, a presumed low-achieving magician, while his little sister becomes a Bloom, a presumed high-achiever in magic. However, there's more to these two siblings than as first thought. And school life at First High School will no longer be the same...\r\nAnd thus, the most anticipated, but highlycontroversial, anime of the spring season has reached its conclusion. Controversial in the fact that this series ranged from \"Mahouka is the best anime ever!\" to \"Wow, this series is complete BS.\" So how did it truly turn out? Was it as good as the die-hard fans claim it was? What about the opinions of the critics who truly despise this series? I find that Mahouka truly fits in between the two; it's neither really good, nor really bad. It was nonetheless a somewhat enjoyable anime series that I didn't regret watching.\\n\\n\r\n\u2028\u2028Before I begin, I will say that there's a high chance that you may end up being in either of the aforementioned polarizing sides. To make things a bit easier, for those who really like and would only watch a huge action-packed series with an adventurous plot, non-stop fight scenes, and emotional characters like some shounens have, you probably want to stop reading this review and find another anime series. The relatively slow-paced Mahouka will actually bore you really fast, and would DEFINITELY not be for you. I probably weeded out a few of you, and you'll thank me for it. Now, I can't guarantee that this review will be spoiler free, but let's dwell a bit further into this series, shall we?\u2028\u2028\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\r\nMahouka focuses on two main leads, who are the Shiba siblings, Tatsuya and Miyuki. The series is split into three arcs, each having a specific school event attached to them (enrolment, a school competition, and a thesis competition). The general idea of Mahouka is that conflict arises, usually from a specialized group having ulterior motives for magic, preventing these school events from going as calm and smoothly as planned, and the students from First High School and other acquaintances will have to deal with them. Conflict doesn't happen immediately, however; everything is set up with loads of dialogue and explanations. Unfortunately, the huge amount of set up can turn stale for some viewers.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem about Mahouka is definitely its pacing. Some would find this series to be incredibly slow due to all the explanations and dialogue used to set up a conflict, especially as a shounen anime. This is highly prominent in the first arc. Later, the events in the story became extremely rushed, which happened most often in the second arc. Most magic was no longer explained in its entirety, and some prior background have been omitted at times. I ended up consulting light novel readers a few times of what I just witnessed. Regardless of your opinion on Mahouka, this is easily the biggest flaw. I like to turn that around and use it as a way to say that this series is unpredictable in nature because of this pacing. You don't know what will Mahouka bring the next episode, but even this can be a relatively frustrating process, especially considering that the plot had very good potential to be great. In all, the story was executed well to a certain extent, but it definitely could of been better. Viewers will have to acknowledge this imminent flaw should they decide to take the plunge to this series. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, each arc does have some pretty interesting perks in the story. There were very well thought out concepts for all the arcs, but the 3rd arc of the series (Episodes 18-26) was easily my favourite. Of course, I won't say what happens then, but for me, the final arc made the series a worthwhile watch. It might be frustrating to have to consult LN readers at times to know some background facts that Madhouse has omitted, as well as a lot of confusing bits here and there, but it's flushed out enough to at least give a small sense of satisfaction at the end to the typical anime watcher such as myself. 6/10\\n\\n\r\n\u2028Art\\n\r\nNo complaints here. The art style is very typical of shounen anime, and instances where the animation quality gets noticeably bad is extremely rare. Action scenes are fluid and flashy, while the character designs are very cool and slick. Honestly, those are some pretty badass school uniforms. There's nothing about the art and animation that really stands out compared to other series, but it gets the job done, and does the job well. I really give Madhouse credit for the great animation quality of this series. 8/10\u2028\u2028\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nAnother one of the better points of this anime. Mahouka has a huge cast of characters (which will be explained later), and Madhouse pretty much recruited the best of the best to voice them. No character sounds awkward or out of place, as most match their individual character's personality very well. I mean, it's like a dream team of all-star seiyuus, including Yuichi Nakamura (Tatsuya), Saori Hayami (Miyuki), and Kana Hanazawa (Mayumi), just to name a few. A job well done to all the voice actors and actresses involved in this series. \\n\\n\r\n\u2028LiSA's \u201cRising Hope\u201d is arguably one of, if not, THE best opening song of Spring Anime 2014, while GARDiNELiA's \u201cgrilletto\u201d stands up as one of the better opening songs for Summer 2014. The ending themes are decent too, but sometimes, the ending scene of an episode does not transition well into the song, especially when suspense was attempted to be made. Mahouka's OST is good in general, and definitely sounds very shounen-like. A good plus side of the series. 9/10\\n\\n\r\n\u2028\u2028Characters\\n\r\nNow, this is the second category that many individuals critic about Mahouka. The story focuses on Tatsuya Shiba and Miyuki Shiba, two characters that are, for some reason, really hated by a lot of people out there. Do the Shiba siblings make or break the series? For some, there is that chance. So I'll explain the pair to the best of my abilities, alongside the other characters of series, and note the places where some people hate about them. \\n\\n\r\n\u2028Tatsuya is enrolled into the First High School as a weed. This would mean that he's presumably weak in magic, right? Wrong. Rather, this guy is seriously overpowered. We definitely can question how on earth was he determined to be an inferior weed in the first place due to these placement tests. The problem some people have over Tatsuya is that he is claimed to be just another \u201cGary Stu\u201d. He only seems to get more and more OP as the series progresses, making him pretty much the \u201cperfect\u201d protagonist. I personally don't think he's completely perfect; he comes at the cost that he rarely develops emotionally. Tatsuya in a sense doesn't feel human, which does make it difficult for him to fit with his classmates and live a perfectly normal school life with his little sister. His lack of human emotions is definitely a conflict that he must always go through, and is something that is explored throughout the series. \\n\\n\r\nTatsuya's mysterious nature definitely creates some suspense in Mahouka. We know Tatsuya is great, but just HOW good he is? What skills will be pull off next? The enigma that is Tatsuya really makes viewers wonder just who the hell he really is. How many things he can pull of his sleeve is pretty damn incredible. Heck, his classmates don't really know who he really is as well later. Tatsuya is an enigmatic character, but whether this is an enjoyable trait is definitely up to the viewer. \\n\\n\r\n\u2028Miyuki is the other main character, who is perhaps as controversial as his older brother. Miyuki is your beautiful, smart and kind female character that many look up to. However, her personality and ideals in general, like Tatsuya, are very simple. Some may argue that it's even bland. Oh, and she may have a slight bro-con for Tatsuya. I'm pretty sure all the complaints that Madhouse got over her cries of \"Onii-sama\" ended up having her get less screen time later in the series. Now, it definitely isn't as black and white as this; however, Madhouse unfortunately does not dwell into this further, which is something that I'll be looking into in the light novels. I do like Miyuki, mostly because of her sincerity and well-mannered demeanour, while getting notable roles in the story as well. However, I'll note that both Tatsuya and Miyuki barely undergo development throughout the series, at least emotionally and a character as a whole. If you get frustrated about characters who really only develop in terms of OPness, then this probably won't be the series for you. For others who don't mind, you're in for a treat. \\n\\n\r\n\u2028The supporting cast is very cool, but they are the supporting cast for a reason. After all, Mahouka centres around Tatsuya and Miyuki the most, who are relatively mysterious but simple individuals in the first place. Some characters appear in episodes to glue some parts of the story together, but they don't get quite enough spotlight to have them fully develop. Again, a lack of character development may be a flaw of this series for some viewers, but that would be way too much to put in a 26-episode series, especially considering that some parts were already feeling rushed. There's at least enough of a blueprint for all the supporting characters to be able to pick a favourite. I personally love the student council president Mayumi myself, but I was slightly disappointed that she didn't get that much time to develop as a character. Overall, this huge cast of characters is nice, but unfortunate sacrifices had to be made in order to prevent these 3 arcs from stretching over 40 episodes. 7/10\\n\\n\r\n\u2028\u2028\u2028Personal Enjoyment\\n\r\nThis series is flawed, yes. The pacing of the story is my biggest concern, with a somewhat lack of character development being another. But I did have the motivation to continue and look forward for the next episode. I personally found the series to be quite enlightening, and there was enough substance for me to be intrigued to continue in watching, even if I know there was quite a few things wrong about it. The concept of Mahouka is very nice, although Madhouse may have not brought it out to its full potential. I do look forward to reading the light novels and continue the series from there.\u2028\u2028 8/10\\n\\n\r\n\u2028\u2028Overall\\n\r\nOn a completely realistic overview, character and story must be weighed more than the art and sound of an anime series. The former may be the weaker points of the series, but it definitely isn't AS bad as some people say it is, nor you should write if off just because of the flaws I've listed above. This is a series where you really have to see it to give a proper opinion on it. Don't inflate your expectations, or you will be disappointed. If you are interested enough after the first few episodes, I'll say that you'll be on the road to watching a pretty nice series. Will it blow you away? No. Will this be a waste of your time? Mostly likely no as well. All in all, despite some flaws, it has been a pleasure watching Mahouka, and I hope some of you will consider watching this series as well! \\n\\n\r\nFinal score: 7/10\\n\\n\r\n(First review, feel free to give some feedback!)",

            "content": "What does it mean to be a good main character? Does it mean being weak and growing strong throughout the story? Or could it mean starting strong but learning how to overcome your weaknesses in order to continue growing? How about starting off absolutely perfect at everything other than noticing girls affection for you? Well, if you answered \"no\" to that last one, you should probably stay away from this show. If you answered \"yes,\" let me show why I believe that is not the right way to create a protagonist.\r\nShiba Tatsuya is a new high school freshman at a prestigious magic academy in near-futureJapan. Magic is being studied like a science and used in order to gain an upper-hand in a long-lasting global conflict. Tatsuya and his twin sister Miyuki happen to be excellent at using magic. Despite that, due to some poorly explained reason, the absolutely-perfect-at-magic-in-every-way-ever-showed Tatsuya somehow ended up in the lower class at the school though Miyuki ended up in the upper class. Most of the students in the upper class look down on the other students as being inferior. Tatsuya soon breaks that boundary and forces his way (and is forced) into the student council by being absolutely perfect. Still, it will take more time than that to fully mend the broken relationship between the upper and lower students. That's just a bit of the stuff that happens at first in MKnR. The story is divided up into several arcs ranging from a few episodes to around ten episodes in length.\\n\\n\r\nI'll go over the characters first since that really is the biggest downside to the show. There are way too many them. This show throws characters at you left and right with minimal explanation given for most of them, and almost zero back-stories for anyone, even the main duo. There is nothing to connect to these characters with emotionally (unless you can relate to having a brother complex). They are bland, two-dimensional characters who serve almost no purpose other than to further the plot, though most don't even do that much. Most characters' designs are so similar that they are easily confused with one another and made even more forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the main duo, Tatsuya and Miyuki Shiba. They are twins from a wealthy and powerful family that is shown on a couple occasions but left out of the picture for 99% of the show. Tatsuya and Miyuki are both flawless with the exceptions being that Miyuki has a brother complex she cannot admit, and Tatsuya is terrible at noticing he has about a handful of girls with a crush on him. Tatsuya seemed like an interesting character in the first episode to me. He was looked down upon due to the class he was put in despite actually being quite skilled. However, the main reason (as I have said and will say many times) is his utter lack of any flaws. He doesn't even seem human. Similarly overpowered genius protagonists like Yagami Light from Death Note and Shiro from No Game No Life are far better than him for that reason. Despite being extremely cunning and seeming to win in basically every situation, they have flaws that make them seem like actual people. They have greed, lust, jealousy, emotions, goals, etc. Tatsuya just goes through this story beating everyone in his path without showing hardly any emotion at all. Even in unimportant situations like just hanging out with friends, he is stoic and emotionless and bland. He always says exactly what he needs to say and executes plans without any hitches. I really don't see why any other characters are necessary in this story since it seems like he could have done everything himself. Miyuki is also similarly strong, but ends up playing a damsel in distress role on one or two occasions making her not quite as perfect. She tends to be rather emotionless as well unless she is flustered romantically or embarrassed. She and Tatsuya together are just some of the most boring main characters I've ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is not much better. Given the huge character cast and boring main characters, the story tends to be slow paced and takes too long to explain things. 90% of MKnR is spent explaining. Almost every time an action scene occurs or a new magic is shown, the show stops and has the characters indirectly explain to the audience what happened even though I never really cared to know most of the time. There's no letting the viewer piece together events to figure out how things occurred. The information overload often makes you forget things as new info is poured into your brain faster than you can stop and think about anything that's been said. Plus most things that are explained are rather unimportant overall and make it hard to focus on the actual important information.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is shoddily done. Created by the same group in Madhouse who did the failure that was Mahou Sensou, the animation really brings down the company's famous name in the anime industry. The characters' faces are devoid of expression throughout the majority of the show and everyone's design is so similar with nearly the same facial structure given to all characters. The backgrounds are not very detailed and the foreground images are sometimes noticeably poorly drawn. On the other hand, the action sequences have good choreography and are well thought out. Most of them involve group battles that involve strategy between fighters. This is also where the animation tends to be the best.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is mostly techno music with some rock music thrown in for some of the action scenes. The music does a good job of adding a nice calm, yet mysterious atmosphere to some of the scenes with explanations galore and makes them slightly better. There are many tracks that are used too often though, and many scenes are devoid of any music where some really should have been used. The second OP and ED are excellent despite the first ones not being anything out of the ordinary.\\n\\n\r\nThis show flops on nearly all aspects. The gigantic character cast with no personality or development was truly the biggest hindrance. Tatsuya is just so flawless that there is absolutely no tension created because you can be sure that he'll wrap everything up easily and move on to the next problem. This show could have been much better which is the most frustrating part. It had potential and an interesting premise but wasted it all on pointless or bad characters, poor animation,  and an ending that politely asks for a second season without really offering anything worthy of receiving it.",

With it's rave reviews from different sites, you can't help but think that this should be one of the favorites for 2014. \r\nUnfortunately that is not to be and if I could sum up this series in one word, it would have to be \"disappointing\".\r\nIf BGM's were included with reviews, I know mine would play Public Enemy's \"Don't Believe the Hype\" as that's what's been running in my mind when I wrote this.\r\nSo getting back to whyI rate this series poorly:\\n\\n\r\nMahouka isn't original and if anything, tries to borrow a lot of settings/tropes which I've seemed to have come across already in manga and anime:\\n\\n\r\n- You have the magic high school setting\\n\r\n- A 'Gary Stu' who for the most part feels like was written as pure fanfic wish-fulfillment ridden with plot armor\\n\r\n- A 'Mary Sue' little sister who for most of each series is pretty annoying with her \"onii-sama this and onii-sama that\"\\n\r\n- The stereotype society who looks down on said 'Gary Stu' for not being at 'their level'(even though he pretty much overpowers every character in the series so far)\\n\r\n- The stereotype friends who place said 'Gary Stu' on a pedestal \\n\\n\r\nStory: 3\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 5\\n\r\nSound: 4\\n\r\nCharacter: 3\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4\\n\r\nOverall: 3\\n\\n\r\nThe series is bland in terms of animation and sound, and coming from a studio whom I actually like(Madhouse), I am pretty disappointed in regards to the overall outcome in which the series has been portrayed. The world building is one info dump after another and the pacing is as slow as my grandmother!\\n\\n\r\nIt's only because I've picked up the light novel that I've given the remaining series the benefit of the doubt, but considering we are 9 episodes in to the show(from when I wrote this) does not give the series any hope that it will be in the top 100 by the end of 2014.\\n\\n\r\nSo to wrap up this review; all I can say is that if you're a first-timer to anime(have seen around 5-10 series) this 'may' be a hit for you, but if you've seen a fair few series like me then be prepared for a snorefest.",

            "content": "\"Onii-sama\", these words are the very heights of the human spirit, they are the essence of a male soul. It is the light that will guide a man during his darkest hour. Make your imouto recite these holy words exactly 167 times over the span of 10 hours and you will be granted what your heart truly desires, my child.\r\nMahouka is like solidifying the shit your dog left on your mattress with liquid nitrogen then dipping it into gold and expecting people to buy it just because it's shiny. And well, people buy it. Apparently. ...Well, actually, that's not quite the case. Mahouka should havebeen just another forgettable fighting magic school themed story adapted from a novel, except for some inexplicable reason, it gets popular. Mahouka is really just boring op-magic-imouto-harem garbage that adopts a not-quite-so-distasteful complexity within it's written dialog. About the only positive thing that I can really say in it's defense is that it somehow manages not to be torture. \u2014 Ah, yes! This is proof that the otaku culture is truly a bliss!\\n\\n\r\nEvery damn magic spell is accompanied by long winded explanations and technobabble. None of which is used for world building, characterization, or whatever else that it could possibly be used for. Zip, zero, nada. The \"intelligence\" in the script is just there for the author to stroke himself \u2014 or I should say Tatsuya Stuba's dick, technically?\u2014 Perhaps it's actually an abstract form of fanservice, it follows this sort of mentality of \"the more complicated the vocabulary the more depth the character has\", uguu! It's similar to the intelligence-fetihization of a loli in the whatever plethora of lolicon tittles I couldn't be bothered to mention. Hey, I would even go as far as to say that the whole series was built around this technobabble. I mean, if you're going for needless complexity in such volumes, why not go all the way and write a pseudo-political thriller a la Code Geass instead? We already have Spinzaku here, and Tatsuya is pretty much scumbag Jesus anyway. At least that would have been more eventful than all of the nothing that happens in the twenty-six episode run of this anime. Something else I should mention, they try to incorporate this idea of discrimination but they don't do anything with it. They had actually tried to justify the puerility of these teenagers pretending to be mature just to rather quickly brush it off with an empty speech. Funny because, this whole issue of \"labels\" could have stopped Mahouka's script from further plunging itself down the drain. The script is actually pretty terrible whenever you aren't being bombarded by technobabble. It's either harem garbage, hue hue not-really-incest heh heh heh heh, or indirectly stroking Tatsuya's dick. The action scenes can also reach irksome levels, almost as bad as what you see in hollywood movies. The Incompetence displayed by the terrorists can be described as simply sad. You would think that being equipped with sub-machine guns and RPGs one could be able to at the very least kill one person in a considerably populated school. \\n\\n\r\n\"There's no one who can possibly defeat my brother.\" - Miyuki.\\n\\n\r\nRepeat the above piece of dialog thirty-or-so times with slightly different variations and you can begin to see the quality of writing in Mahouka, if you haven't already. Also, yup, what Tatsuya has isn't just any piece of armor, what he has is reinforced plot armor that's heavier and thicker than a whales hide. \\n\\n\r\nSuffering several bone fractures, damaged organs and massive hemorrhaging? Not a problem, he'll just magically restore himself back to perfect health. Getting shot through the heart? Barely so much as tips him off balance a bit. Catching bullets with his bare hands? You betcha~ \u2014 There's absolutely no tension when a character is this powerful. And that isn't even the worst of it, the biggest offender of all happens in the last episode. It speaks for itself really. \\n\\n\r\nNo, better still is his ability to make girls drop their panties faster than you can say \"bullshit\". He does this in his usual inhumanly calm demeanor without so much as lifting a finger. No, he doesn't even flirt with the girls, the reason for this being because imouto pussy is best pussy. Just about every female subconsciously gravitates towards him and instinctively want to have his babies because they just know that he has superior mating capabilities. \\n\\n\r\nNo, wait, wait, wait, wait!! Tatsuya is a deconstruction of the Gary Stu archetype as he's actually a pathetic fatass okatu in a show that's actually a clever self parody.\u2014 Just an instance of Mahouka's brilliant comedy, when a high-school girl whose been hiding behind a tree gets her position compromised, she escapes her pursuers in the most dramatic way possible: by getting on a cheap looking scooter that actually takes off with two jet engines. You just have to see it for yourself, I'm clearly not writing it down correctly.\u2014 Tatsuya may not look like a fatass with an imouto fetish... but that's because you're already under his spell, see? Yeah, it's a spell of his that affects all your senses so you can't tell. When Miyuki asks if she looks weird in the new apron she bought for him to see her in, he replies with \"You look lovely. So much so that I want to secretly display you in a glass case just for me.\" See? This is proof that he's a fatass basement dweller. It simply won't do you any good to deny facts.\\n\\n\r\nOh, wait, how could I forget? Whenever these two say anything incestuous it's just a joke. \\n\\n\r\nFinal verdict: 0/10 Nowhere near racist enough, needs more propaganda.",

            "content": "I thought this anime was going to be really good. I watched the first episode and thought maybe it gets better later (which I was told happened in the Light Novels). Sadly it didn't. I really wanted this anime to succeed, with my friend introducing it to me. However it's not what it's lacking is the problem, it's what it does too much of.\r\n~Story~\r\n-I gave it a 5 because I hardly could get into the story. When it introduced a school setting, alarms already started going off in my head. 'Oh no, this isn't going to be one of those convoluted teenage identity crisis dramasis it?'. Thankfully it wasn't. Unfortunately it was something else just as bad. Seriously what is it with this \"Blooms and Weed\" classification of the students? This really doesn't make sense because it's just another little path for the Gary-Stu of a main character to completely trample like he does everything else. A little action here and there, mostly exposition, almost NO development of plot or character. Utter bore.\\n\\n\r\n{Art}\\n\r\n-It's not too shabby. The fight scenes are nice with the magical effects and what not. Only problem is, the fights last like what? Less than a second? No seriously that happens. It's foolish. The reasoning behind it is even more so. However it is decent, passable. \\n\\n\r\n[Sound]\\n\r\n-Same here, although the droning of the main character doesn't help. Not much to say honestly because it's just that: fair. Nothing great but at the same time nothing bad to point out.\\n\\n\r\n\\Character/\\n\r\n-Oh boy here we go. Like I said: the MC was emotionless for a reason which was extremely stupid. The relationship between the MC and his little sister is just iffy. Why does it exist? Is the creator trying to tease at some sort of incestuous relationship? Is he trying to induce some sort of comedic value (since it is only hinted at). Besides that little sister is just plain soulless like every other character in the show. She's only there to make the older brother look good like some sick fantasy of a wish-fulfillment  type story. Without him? She's absolutely NOTHING. At least the other characters have some sort of niche trope to fill although still laughable since the main character is just so good at everything. (stu stu stew stoo) \\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment-\\n\r\n-Interesting AT FIRST because I was hyped to see this \"magic\" in action. I saw the first fight. I tried to be forgiving, watching it recapped in the second episode. Disappointment. All this show did was talk about something. Nobody ever said \"I FEEL this\" or \"This makes me want to do X\". And there's the problem right there. Almost little to no expression. And if these characters are so unwilling to show some real emotion? Why should I? Oh yeah like I could feel sorry for that samurai girl when she was an idiot for mistaking her senior's words a few years ago. Honestly, there was nothing to pull me in. Nothing to say: 'Watch this anime, it's interesting for this reason!'. But there is no reason. Do I want to see triumph after triumph? No. I want to see development, feeling, action. Some substance to this lifeless anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\n!Overall?\\n\r\n-It was bad:\\n\\n\r\n-Story was boring. It was a generic school setting with generic student barriers with a generic unbalanced ratio between female and male student characters. Yeah, you know where I'm going with this.\\n\\n\r\n-Art was Ok\\n\r\n-Sound was Ok\\n\\n\r\n-Boring characters with little to no substance. The MC was boring and never made anything interesting. His little sister is a damn barbie doll. Everyone else is there to make our robot of an MC look good.\\n\\n\r\n-Nigh enjoyable, unless you like to jump on hype trains, see Gary-Stus just do boring stuff because of self-projection unto characters FTW. \\n\\n\r\nIt could have been good. It really could have. Removing the little sister because she provides nothing but a pseudo goal for the main character would have immensely improved the story because then it would have been fun seeing a robot own everything and then do some exposition for the hell of it. Giving the characters more substance because: seriously... what are their names again? Anyways, not much to say but don't blame me, blame a boring anime. Cheers.",

I'm going to try writing a review on here for an anime I really enjoyed: Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei.\r\nSo, for the story part of this anime, I have to say that it's really cool. First half of the show takes place in a Magic School, where people learn magic. But not like wizardry magic, but a futuristic technology that allows people to use magic. There's a lot of dialogue that may annoy people, but I personally found the dialogue really interesting. There's a school magic competition, and multiple magic schools compete in it. Pretty funto watch. The second half gets even better. It's about another organization trying to sabotage the Magic High competition, and it goes even further than that. The ass-kicking that goes on in the 2nd half was the best.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and the music are the best parts of the show. The art was perfect HD-level beauty. The opening and ending songs to the show are one of my favorites ever. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters of the show, oh man. This was spectacular, there are so many great characters. But I'll start with my favorite anime character ever, Shiba Tatsuya, the main character. He is so overpowered and badass, it was a beaut to see. Furthermore, my name is Tatsuya! We have the connection! But really, all the characters were awesome, except for Shiba Miyuki, whose love for her older brother was sort of disturbing. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime so much, and I'm guessing that this is where I recommend this anime to people. I definitely recommend this anime to anyone that likes magic and badass main characters, and can sit through some dialogue that I know a lot of people will dislike.",

            "content": "I've probably said this some time before, but I'll say it again. I hate light novel adaptations. Not all of them however. Some of them in fact, have proven to be great in fact such as Baccano, Spice and Wolf and the Monogatari franchise but the vast majority are near enough the exact same god damn thing. Some boring as hell high school character who is a beta male joins a new school and instantly gains a harem and becomes the number one fighter. Rinse and repeat every season. These shows are vapid, boring and appeal to the lowest common denominator and yet, still becomemassively popular. When I saw this show announced a few years back and noticed who were making this anime, I had some hope. Maybe Madhouse can make a light novel adaptation great? Unfortunately my hope dropped as quickly as when Grandma fell down the stairs.\\n\\n\r\nThe Irregular at Magic High School aired in the exact same season as another masterpiece; Black Bullet, which should give you some indication into the quality we're talking about here. The narrative of this wonderful work of fiction centres around the 'God' type of Light Novel guy in a world in which magic has become a technical skill. These main characters are the ones who are the most badass guys around, keep a cool and calm composure and can do literally ANYTHING that the plot demands them to do. The most famous Light Novel guy of this archetype is my good o' buddy Kirito from SAO and Tatsuya, from this show, is NO different. He can seemingly do anything and everything while also remaining insanely strong and overpowered to the point that no one in this can actually lift a finger to him. It's like if you were in a Yu-Gi-Oh! tournament and your first opponent were Yugi; you're royally screwed.\\n\\n\r\nAs a result, none of the fights have any tension what-so-ever since our Light Novel God never loses and even in the few situations where it appears he might be on the edge of losing, he will pull some random power-up out of his ass and end up winning with the power of 'plot armour magic'. It's incredibly hard to attach yourself onto him or to feel any narrative stakes in the show when they're so clearly trying to aim just for that since Light Novel God has no personality to speak of. He is an emotionless robot with no personality and always has the same deadpan expression. He feels lifeless; dull.  It's understandable to think he behaves in this fashion due to his upbringing and the such but the character hardly ever experiences any sense of levity or hints at an actual human underneath his veil of a badass guy. Aside from the fact that he wants to do the birds and the bees with his sister. Yup! \\n\\n\r\nThis is another troupe of Light Novel God's archetype. They ALWAYS have a little sister or cousin that is madly in love with him to the point of them very heavily hinting at them wanting sexual intercourse with their sibling. Light Novel God's imoutoto is also perhaps the most annoying character in this show and that's saying a lot. She is constantly defending her brother from all criticism of others, while not allowing any girl aside from herself to get near him (Yuno Gasi, much?). The show presents any character who so much as slightly dislikes Light Novel God to be an evil asshole! As if anyone who dares not to like him must suffer from the fate of falling down Grandma's stairs. She is presented as the perfect girlfriend only making her waifu bait for body pillows and masturbation purposes. Her character goes nowhere and remains as Light Novel Guy's perfect waifu, only to add onto his list of already perfect qualities. This is lazy writing 101. Why should the audience feel that Light Novel God is anything less than perfect? Why should he have faults which would make him feel more real? Oh, I know why! Because he is now easier to self-insert for all of the damn basement dwellers. \\n\\n\r\nLight Novel God is a guy who is always morally correct, always the one teaching others life lessons and has a sad and 'totally not forced' back-story in a pathetic attempt to make the audience feel sorry for this guy. After Light Novel God and Imouto-whore attend their new school, they're split into two different classes depending on their skill level and despite Light Novel God being the most overpowered character this side of Dragon Ball Zeee, he is placed in the 'weeds' class while imouto-whore is placed in the 'Blooms' class. The anime attempts to try and shove down our throats the theme surrounding the discrimination of wizards between the higher class and lower classes but like everything else in this show, goes nowhere in the slightest. It's a sad attempt to make the people attending the school with Light Novel God to believe he is weak and pathetic for him only to contradict this every episode by showcasing his insane talent. Why the hell he was placed in the lower class, I have no clue. The main idea of this theme was so that the audience can sympathise with the character and feel excited when he proves himself but it becomes so pointless as he has every power under the Sun so his victory never feels earned. \\n\\n\r\nThe story goes nowhere and all of the terrorist attacks, evil organisations and tournament arcs are so forgetful as there are no interesting characters in the slightest. Every other side character is constantly sucking the dick of Light Novel God for his awesome talent and the fact that he is a nice guy. None of the side characters get hardly any screen time and the show feels like it's constantly going around in circles with no direction or plot progression. Light Novel God's attachment to this story is as strong as my attachment to a Twix bar. It's hard to care about what is going on without any characters to feel invested in especially when everything in this show is dull to the eye. That's another thing with this show. It's not remotely interesting visually either. The animation is pretty standard and there are no errors or moments of quality drops it's just that the entire production is so visually dull with boring colours, framing and shot composition that it's hard to stay awake and watching this show feels like a chore, even more so with how little the plot actually progresses half the time. It has a good budget, it's just all of it is boring.\\n\\n\r\nThe exposition in this show is on par with the crap in Black Bullet. They throw around so much techno mumble jumble that it's hard to make sense of what is going on. Light Novel God goes into these long and unbroken narrations into the intricacies of a magic technique which go on for so god damn long it becomes so tedious to watch and makes me want to fall asleep. And these exposition scenes can go on for upwards to ten minutes sometimes! Damn! Show, don't tell! I understand explaining stuff is important but Jesus! Every fight is essentially only two minutes in length followed by a bunch of twats talking for half an hour about what just happened. This makes sense in text form, as time slows down when you're reading but the adaptation is a far different story. This still doesn't make the light novel good; please don't think that...it's still awful.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Mahouka is a poor wish fulfilment piece of garbage and these shows need to die out. The theme exploration is a joke, the characters are overshadowed by Light Novel God, the plot has no sense of direction and it wasn't even entertainingly bad. It's dull, static and does nothing right. It's crappy fantasy empowerment for basement dwellers. \\n",

            "content": "Mahouka is the worst anime of all time. It's the twisted dream of a hateful lunatic who shuts out the outside world. The impression it gives of itself is of something highly paranoid and self-righteous, designed to feed into the delusions of people who want to imagine themselves as silent martyrs.\r\nThe central character, Tatsuya, is a superman, who is impossible to defeat in combat, portrayed as more intelligent than every other character, and is found attractive by every female character in the show. The argument has been made that he is, in fact, an antihero, because he uses these abilities to do things that aretraditionally considered morally bad. To this I would say:\\n\\n\r\n- Even when Tatsuya\u2019s actions are portrayed as morally ambiguous or even morally wrong, he\u2019s still framed as the victim. He\u2019s had his strong emotions removed, and is therefore the show refuses to hold him responsible for anything he does that he really shouldn\u2019t do.\\n\\n\r\n- The show frames him as morally superior to all of the characters who are his enemies, be they foreign terrorists or other students who mistreat him.\\n\\n\r\n- Many of the villains in the show are motivated by jealousy toward Tatsuya.\\n\\n\r\nThe first point is the important one. Tatsuya is treated as a victim at every turn. His sister, essentially the secondary main character of the show, is completely defined by guilt over the fact that Tatsuya had his strong emotions stripped for the sake of protecting her. She becomes a mouthpiece that the show uses to point out when we are supposed to feel bad for Tatsuya, with no agency of her own beyond a profound desire to be subservient to him. It\u2019s not even possible to say that her perceptions of his suffering are just a part of her subjective experience as a character, because what she says is shown to make the other characters agree with her.\\n\\n\r\nA corollary to the victimization of Tatsuya is that other characters in the show who would be victims are blamed for their own suffering. Everything Tatsuya is put through he endures without ever complaining. The people who do complain are framed poorly because of it. The first arc of the show involves tension at the school because the Course 2 students, who did not score well on the entrance exam and were therefore denied instruction, are constantly bullied and mistreated by the others. They want to end this, so they protest by occupying areas of the school. This is nonviolent civil disobedience, which is not inherently bad - there is nothing wrong with breaking the rules when you've exhausted every other measure of making people listen to you. However, the show demonizes the Course 2 students for doing this. After their protest is shut down, they are given an audience with the student council to talk about what they think could be changed in school. However, when they come to the negotiations, the Course 2 students did not have any coherent demands. According to the show, they did this because they wanted and expected the student council to do all the work for them. Already it frames these people as lazy and unintelligent; they were given a pre-arranged meeting, and yet they did not come prepared with any points to make. This is simply ludicrous, an obvious strawman. It follows this with a debate between the student council president and a representative of the Course 2 students. The debate goes that every point made by the Course 2 student was outright false, and the student council president gave a speech. The lengths the show goes to to portray the Course 2 students as stupid or lazy are absurd; the Course 2 representative was so demonstrably wrong in everything he said that we wonder how he even came up with his points in the first place. Then, in her speech, she said the Course 2 students were to blame for their own mistreatment because they didn\u2019t stand up for themselves. At the same time, she chastises the Course 2 students who did stand up for themselves for not doing so in a way that respected the rules - the rules that have so far failed to prevent Course 1 students from trying to literally decapitate Course 2 students. She also said that while she did not think discrimination against Course 2 students was acceptable, she did not want \u201cnew discriminatory practices\u201d to be put in place. This, of course, is a logical inconsistency; the Course 2 students never did or said anything to give the impression that they would cause new discrimination. To say that they did is inconsistent with the show\u2019s internal logic, as it was clearly stated within the same episode that the Course 2 students had no demands or ideas. But the show runs with this strawman. Her speech is accompanied by shots of Course 2 students hanging their heads in shame, and is followed by applause from the whole student body while a golden light glows from behind her. \\n\\n\r\nSo, Mahouka resolved its first story arc by blaming the victims of discrimination for their own suffering because they didn\u2019t stand up for themselves, but also blamed the victims who did stand up for themselves for not doing it in the right way. It did the latter by presenting a completely fabricated strawman argument and acting as though it were sound. The conclusion was that those who lack power have only themselves to blame, and should just respect the status quo in the hope that those who do have power will magnanimously decide to give them rights.\\n\\n\r\nMeanwhile, Tatsuya has also been a victim of discrimination. He was wrongly classified as a Course 2 student, and the (male) Course 1 students treat him poorly for it until he gets the chance to prove himself. He was granted a chance by the system, whose rules he obeyed, and he took it. So, it would be unfair to say that Mahouka totally denies the Course 2 students the chance to make themselves look better; it\u2019s much more insidious than that. It says that the way to make oneself look better is to hold to old-fashioned values, which Tatsuya does, but as the show goes on the real ugliness of those values comes to light. \\n\\n\r\nThe morality to which the show subscribes is rooted in a persecution complex. Tatsuya is portrayed as a stronger and more credible person than any character who actually acts on their own suffering because he endures it all. He is a silent martyr, one who never complains, operating under the assumption that all people who mistreat him are either too evil or too stupid to respond to protest, and that protest is therefore pointless. It also says that such stoic victims like him are heroes, because they\u2019re able to take on suffering other characters can\u2019t endure. Even if you would argue that the casual way he kills people in the show is meant to paint him as an antihero or even a villain, the dialogue later in the show clearly states that he is the real victim and that the only reason what he does seems horrible is because he does things normal people need done, but can\u2019t handle, and that this is why he is the only one fit to carry great power. And yes, the point is that he is the only one: There is a scene in which another character is moved to take action, inspired by Tatsuya's success - only to be stopped by Tatsuya because he can't take it.\\n\\n\r\nThe entire show has a military mentality, as if every single aspect of life should be treated as a war. Some people will agree with this. Those people are fascists. Because of this mentality, it doesn't matter that Tatsuya isn't good at moving eggs across a table with magic when he's immortal, can fly, can destroy an entire country from his living room, and can vaporize people from a distance.\\n\\n\r\nIf his defining character trait is that he suffers quietly, then several other characters are defined by their jealousy of him. They have all gone through suffering, and never see him appear to suffer. The problem with this is that even if it were admirable to take every transgression without complaining, that is no justification for demonizing people who express their pain or break the rules when the system has only hurt them and done nothing to help them.\\n\\n\r\nThe main message of the show comes across as this: The way the world SHOULD be is that those in power are people who can tolerate hardship better than others, and that other people should either learn to suffer silently or know their place so as not to get in the way. It\u2019s completely one-sided in favor of the powerful. You could argue that the show is critical of people in power because they\u2019re the ones who are victimizing Tatsuya, but those are people who do not take suffering as well as he does, and the conflict of the story is that they should not be in power; rather, Tatsuya, Jumonji, Ichijo, and the student council president are the people who should have power, the current people in power are not strong enough to be in power, and everyone else is weak and in need of protection, and therefore civil disobedience is biting the hand that feeds. The problem with this is not even that it's inherently untrue, but that it romanticizes the struggle of people in power (people who don't need romanticizing) and denies the importance of the people under them, treating them only as a burden and another source of suffering.\\n\\n\r\nApparently disjointed from all of this is the show\u2019s attitude toward women. In one scene, the camera lingers on a woman\u2019s breasts in the middle of a serious conversation. This is already bad; what business does the camera have doing that in those circumstances? But what makes it worse is that immediately after this, Tatsuya criticizes the woman for dressing too revealingly. Nothing about this is OK; it gives the impression that what she was wearing was so important that it warranted interrupting a serious discussion, and it makes it so that the previous shot wasn\u2019t just the camera perving at her but trying to frame her in a negative light at the same time. And another thing: Her clothes weren\u2019t actually revealing at all. This happens more than once; that isn\u2019t the only time a character is called out for dressing in \u201crevealing\u201d clothing. In another episode a character wears an outfit that lacks sleeves. It\u2019s a completely innocuous outfit that wouldn\u2019t look out of the ordinary to any reasonable person, but another character takes one look at her and says \u201cOh my, that\u2019s rather revealing.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nObviously it should make no difference whether the outfit is revealing or not, but the fact that the show decides to draw attention to it, especially when using the descriptor \u201crevealing\u201d is outright false, is absolutely Victorian. The only character who dresses in revealing clothing and isn\u2019t called out for it is Tatsuya\u2019s sister, and she never does it in public; she only does it to please Tatsuya. \\n\\n\r\nThe show also draws attention to the women\u2019s outfits during the interschool sports tournament, in which it dismissively labels a sport in which female students participate as something they only do to show off the costumes they wear while doing it. All this is less egregious than the show having a one-off joke about a male student saying he would force himself on a female student before pairing them off as teammates for the rest of the story. Not to mention it was Tatsuya's idea that they should be together.\\n\\n\r\nOn the sports tournament, the show\u2019s second arc that lasts eight episodes: Everything that happens in it is devoid of tension and entirely irrelevant. First High School wins every sporting event in a total blowout, leaving no excitement because you always know from the start that they\u2019re going to win. Also, all their success is attributed to Tatsuya. What\u2019s more, the entire arc, all eight episodes, is almost completely empty of anything significant, offering no substance at all except more glorification of Tatsuya at the expense of other characters. It doesn't have any relevance to the main plot, either, which wouldn't be a problem if it contained any interesting matieral, but it doesn't. It\u2019s one long, boring tangent.\\n\\n\r\nAnd yes, the word boring is actually another good way to describe this show. The vast majority of the dialogue consists of explanations of why the different magic spells used in the show worked. This information is completely worthless; there's no reason why we should need to know all this. Extensive \"worldbuilding,\" in better shows, can be used to discuss a real-life concept, to produce something visually interesting, or even elevate the entire setting into the realm of symbolism. None of this happens in Mahouka. It is one of the least visually interesting shows available outside of a couple action scenes, the extensive explanations of magic aren't even relevant to the show's own plot (let alone real life), and it doesn't reflect the show's ideology. It just creates an artificial veneer of \"complexity\" that doesn't relate to the rest of the show.\\n\\n\r\nBy the end of the show, Tatsuya's powers suck all potential conflict out of the story. That\u2019s when Mahouka becomes a total non-narrative. It\u2019s just a long delusion designed to gratify people who see themselves as being similar to Tatsuya; people who believe that if only other people would notice how great they really are, they would be recognized, and who take pride in the fact that they feel bad all the time but never complain about it. Ultimately the antihero argument doesn\u2019t hold up because the cinematic direction of the anime glorifies him, he never does anything bad to anyone who didn\u2019t deserve it (usually in some overblown evil fashion), and he is never held fully responsible for the bad things he does. Even if he was, the speech given in episode 4 is indefensible, and tilts the rest of the show entirely in Tatsuya's favor no matter how hard it may try to frame him as an antihero.",

            "content": "There is a reason why anime with a setting that revolves around a high school rarely becomes successful. Because it is to me one of the most overused settings for the last few years and only once in a while does it work out particularly well like in the case of the Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. Now with this show there is a lot of hype around due to the proclaimed success of its light novels. I personally haven't read them myself so I can't say for sure how good it is. But after viewing six episodes I feel I can give my unbiased reviewof this show that was adapted. For starters it brings up a topic that's been been shoved down our throuts since any of us as children started school. bullying and discrimination. Yes it tackles this issue head on as the issue many people in this story face comes in one of three types. The oppressed victims who see no way out, The overconfident and biased opressors, and the realists who realize true equality can't exist but can be made better. I feel that part of the reason this show got so popular in the first place was because of how relatable it's premise is because everyone at some point in their life has either been bullied or was the bully for the sake of popularity. Now in this show that reasoning for the bullying or harassment has simply been about perceived intelligence due to grades. Because this show separates people in two classes with outfits that easily distinguish them \"course 1\" the honor students, and \"course 2\" the remedial class students\". The general idea in this school is that if you are in course 1 then for some reason you get the right to be a complete dick to everyone in course 2. They even have a different, more straightforward but offensive term for the course 2 students and have called them \"Weeds\" while course 1 are \"blooms\" due to their potential as magic users and weeds percieved inability to grow. Now that we got the premise here the main character is something that contradicts this class based system. There's Tatsuya Shiba, he is a course 2 student with skills that are in practical use, far superior then even those of course 1 but this is due to how the school evaluates certain qualities in students way more then others which is pretty realistic given how they work. His personality as a character is to be cool an reserved and his motivations are simple. Get the diploma from magic high school and become a magic scientist. Now I know what you are thinking, why did I give this show a 7 out of 10? Because there are some serious faults when it comes to this show.\\n\\n\r\nList of problems\\n\r\n#1 the main character has a blood-related sister who loves him and the relationship is one sided and extremely echhii. I don't understand the big deal with brother-sister relationships in anime and can be extremely off-putting if not in the right light. I have seen this work many times like with attack on titan with Mikasa and Eren and even the show currently airing Hitsugi no Chaika makes it work because they aren't echhii or blood related. If they didn't put too much focus on this I'd probably have a a better time watching this show.\\n\\n\r\n#2 Too big a cast of supporting characters and not enough variation in character designs. There are way way way too many people in this show to make this work for a 26 episode anime, so many that I highly doubt that you can remember half of them as their character introductions are also very short and abrupt and they also all wear essentially the same uniform with the only two things that can possibly make them different are the flower or grey shoulder patch or the the pattern on the blouse for females. It's made it so I can only focus on the main character and what his main focus is for the time being. Because of this I can't feel like I should care about most of this supporting cast as they more or less take up space.\\n\\n\r\n#3 the main protagonist gets all da bitches. Yes just like in sword art online literally every girl in the school is interested in Tatsuya for no real reason. This is serious wish fulfillment right here as some of these girls from course 1 should be shrugging him off but instead are flocking toward him. And that brings me to the final problem\\n\\n\r\n#4 easily distinguished class structure. If a school wants to make honor and remedial classes, that's fine, if they want to categorize these classes, that is also fine, but whoever was the genius to that decided that giving kids uniforms that clearly differentiated their grade level from one another wouldn't cause discrimination has got to the biggest idiot on the planet and isn't realistic as to how schools are ran.\\n\\n\r\nSo with that I give this show a 7 out of 10, it can be an interesting show when the magic starts flying around but don't get your hopes up too high",

            "content": "Honestly, I thought this anime was schlock. Literally the only things I enjoyed about it were the art direction (some of the magic looked really cool, surprisingly) and the premise behind it was intriguing enough to give it a shot. \r\nAfter 10 episodes, I'm done. I can't do anymore, and i can't in good conscious recommend anyone else follows this show. \r\nThe characters are paper thin. Tatsuya Shiba has no emotional depth or complexity in any real or meaningful way. And were that intentional, were the anime to demonstrate how dangerous divorcing oneself from emotion and refusing to empathize with others can be, that wouldbe fine, I suppose. But the prime means by which it could manage this is through his sister. And when presented with this opportunity, the show basically goes \"Fuck that, instead she wants to sleep with him.\" She's used as a means of propping up how great he is, rather than a humanizing element of a show in desperate need of it. Every single character is sterile, boring, serving their plot purpose with no real humanization behind them. Nearly every single female character swoons over Tatsuya, to the detriment of their own character, which is annoying as hell too. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot is garbage, but I could have lived with a garbage plot! I would have been fine with just a schlocky, terribly plotted-and-paced show with cool fight scenes, were it not THIS bad. There are multiple instances in the beginning that basically go \"hey so you know how these people face oppression and a societal system that continually treats them as lesser? FUCK 'EM, IT'S THEIR OWN FAULT.\"  Rather than attempting to take a complex look at a system where people are disproportionately privileged, it chooses a hyper-simplistic route, saying, in essence, that the reason people are less privileged is because they don't deserve it. \\n\\n\r\nThat's not an exaggeration, by the way. There's literally a scene in which they discuss a terrorist organization and Tatsuya basically goes \"Oh well, their main issue is with the disproportionate median income, but you see, magicians DESERVE to be richer, they just work that much harder and they're that much more important.\" \\n\\n\r\nWhat I saw of this series left a bad taste in my mouth. Decent looking animation and some mildly cool magic and concepts don't make up for terrible plot, worse characters, and generally gross Author Preaching coming from the characters. If you could send somebody around to give me a severe enough concussion that I forget everything I know about this anime, that would be fantastic.",

            "content": "Allow me to ask some interesting questions\r\nWhat is the point with action?\r\nWhat is the point wiht suspence?\r\nWhat is the point with character development?\r\nWhat is the point with problems or struggle in anime?\r\nWhile we all have different opinions on this matter we can all agree on one thing, all of those things above are needed in order for us to enjoy a show and feel that the story and characters can make progression, it is then we can say that it was good.\r\nLet me tell you about a show that ignores all that, a show where nothing matters except for one thing, the hero of thestory. A show where only one person matters and the rest of the cast is there simply to serve the hero and to be amazed at how the hero is so good. This hero is named Tatsuya Shiba and the show is called Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei or The Irregular magical highschool in english. So stay a while and listen.........\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nIn the future where magic rules and is the law, where you are considered a outcast if you cant use magic correctly or lack in any department. Even schools are segregated based upon this theory, upper and lower classes. It is here where our main protagonist is introduced. Tatsuya Shiba and his sister Tatsuya Miyuki enters the magical school but in different classes. Tatsuya is placed in the group of Weeds which is the low class magic users. They have scored the low on all the exams and are considered usless while at the same time his sister Miyuki is placed with the Blooms, an elite group who even have different uniforms with more style on them so to speak. \\n\\n\r\nOK, this does not sound so bad right? i mean, this could be good, an documentary about human friction and relationships with different ranks could be quite good. A brother on one side and the sister on the other, this boils down for some good and emotional conflict right?. WRONG. The very first episode and ep 2 showcases that Tatsuya is simply placed wrong becouse he cant clean bathrooms but he is very powerful, in fact, it is showcased that he can do everything and when i say everything i mean exactly that. The conflict between Blooms and Weeds are later thrown out and it does not even matter after few episodes becouse this show is not about society nor its struggle, its about a light novel protagonist that is so OP that nothing matters anymore. This show simply becomes Tatsuya Shiba adventure where he is put into different scenarios but even this is pointless. Story from now on simply stops and i dont care.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nDear lord, lets begin.............\\n\\n\r\nTatsuya Shiba\\n\\n\r\nThe main hero of this stupid non existent story. Tatsuya is one of the worst characters i have ever seen in anime and i have up to this point watched around 216, sure it may not be much but enough to judge this asshole and how ridiculous he is. This show is supposed to be an action show but with him, sorry, all the battles, everything he does boils down to that he is so OP that nothing matters, nothing. I bitched about Kirito from SAO the way he was but let me tell you, Kirito is simply a child and a crybaby compared to what Tatsuya is. Tatsuya can heal, revive people from death, stop nuclear weapons, disable weapons with an EMP, pretty much nothing stops him. He is cold and only speaks wise words, you know becouse its edgy. I think that he would fit more of an antagonist role becouse he is smart and everything he does, he had planned it from the start.\\n\\n\r\nThis is not an human being, he is a monster of an character, he is what many cool kids wants to be, allways win, allway be on top of things and allways have the cutest girls around him so they can drool on how amazing Tatsuya truly is. The fact that he is still a kid in school makes this almost like a comedy of sorts on how retarded and pendering this entire light novel adopations truly are. Tatsuya Shiba is everything that is wrong with OP charcters, well no, not character becouse and actual character have a personality, Tatsuya Shiba is everthing in one, a Monster that a mad doctor made in a lab somewhere.\\n\\n\r\nMiyuki\\n\\n\r\nAnd now to his sister, an incest infected sister at that. Miyuki is there for one thing and one thing alone, to glow and drool over her big brother and how awsome he is. Oni sama, oni sama and more oni sama, thats her character in a nutshell. To make things even worse, she is also in love with her own brother and blushes every time he says somethng good to her. When other girls show any kind of interest towards Tatsuya she becomes hostile to them and to her own brother for daring to offer his affections to someone else than her. What an pure garbage character, like any girl in this show, she is there to be rescued when danger appears, she lacks her own goal, her character is basicly to have her brother for herself and allways want his body near her. i think you get the point.\\n\\n\r\nAction scenes and expositions:\\n\\n\r\nIf Tatsuya was not bad enough the entire show is so damn boring, remember those long and boring science classes, for me i allways fell asleep during them. this is exactly how i feel about this garbage, the long expositions is simply way too much dragged out. One battle takes about less than a minute to conclude but the show then spends over 3 minutes to talk about the battle and what happened during it. The writers felt the need to go into detail about magic, science and what not. I dont think a lot of people will even care about it, they are here for the action not some badly written expositions and tries to be so in deph that we all loose the interest. Instead of flashing out the world,setting and story the show spends time instead on science which i dont even care about. This show gets it all wrong, exposition is good but only if it serves the overall narrative.\\n\\n\r\nThen we come to the villains and the battles, man, what the hell went wrong here?. Oh yeah, Tatsuya. I mentioned previously what the point with action series was and this show simply does not care about suspence, tactics, strategy,planning and consequences after each battle and what would happen if you loose. This show says goodbye to everything and makes Tatsuya a hero who defeats his opponets with absolute ease without even trying. The series tries to establish that a bounch of terrorists is about to attack and they have powerful weapons on them. Damn,getting good right? WRONG, Tatsuya can disable the weapons with one swoop by using EMPs or whatnot. Yeah, so much for suspence. \\n\\n\r\nOne othe scenario that is often showed is that the girls gets trapped but by now you know by now that Tutsuya will save them and that is what the show is waiting for. He allways shows up and he for some reason, allways can forsee everything that will happen. By that point, you realize that nothing is exiting anymore and also i started to question why they even animated the battles to begin with, calling it battle is even insulting to the word itself. Pure self insert garbage from the beginning to the end.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\\n\r\nThis show is the worst pieces of gargabe that ever came out from Japan. Everything that is wrong with anime protagonists and LN:s is here. OP character that ruins every battle, has control on all situations, having even other characters to be there just becouse of him and more. Kirito was also Op in his own show but at least he had some human side to him but Tatsuya is on a whole new level of retardness. A fantasy \"self insert\" written by an 10 year old who just started to write fanfiction for the first time. Everything that happens in this show lacks becouse there is nothing at stake and even if it is, you know it will be solved, the show simply holds time until Tutsuya shows up and resolves the situation in less than a minute but we have to spend about 25 minutes per episode on this garbage.\\n\\n\r\nThe irregular Magical Highschool is one of the most pontless shows ever made in my book. If you watch one episode, you have seen them all. Incest sister, OP Tatsuya, pointless and wasted potential, non existent characters, stupid expositions that is pointless and wasted budget on the animation for the battles which by the way can be predicted by simply watching 2 of them.\\n\\n\r\nMahouka Koukou no Rettousei is a monster of a show and an insult to your intelligence.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I watched the whole thing... why did I waste my time? It was most likely the next hot thing when I first saw it probably...\r\nWell, it's terrible and here's why.\r\nI've read the LN as well, won't add it to my list as I don't wanna see it there.\r\nIt's bad as well.\r\nThe only good thing about it was the concept behind the magic being scientific. But if it ain't executed right, does it matter? lol.\r\nThe thing that drags the entire show is the terrible as hell main character.\r\nFirst of all, it doesn't miss a single moment to pamper the main protagonist.\r\nWithout even trying I already haveabout 9-10 times they repeated ''how great he is''... ''what a prodigy he is''  ''How capable he is'' ''He's the strongest in the world'' in mind.\\n\r\nYet they also love to victimize him at the same time so he is sympathetic as well... well it doesn't work when he's probably the definition of perfect.\\n\r\nHe's overpowered as fuck. A talented magician placed in a crappy kids class. He\u2019s there because he is bad at pushing some block on a floor with his mind. Surely they will not judge his capabilities solely based on that and will give him other tests? Nah, dude... why would they? -__-\\n\\n\r\nHe is a brilliant magician and can cancel any other magician's attack and he\u2019s stupidly intelligent to the point that he can solve the world's hardest magical problems in less than a second. When he has some free time he is an engineer, going by the name of the oh so mysterious Silver creating the best magical gear in the world. He solves magical problems that the rest of the world have been struggling with for years. He creates the power of flight just cause he suddenly thought of doing that. He has a freaking X-ray vision. He can take down an entire team of terrorists by himself. He can detonate the power equivalent of an atomic bomb over anywhere in the world. He can heal all wounds instantly. He can raise the dead. But he is not very good at pushing a square inch block across a floor so clearly he\u2019s a flawed character.\\n\\n\r\nWhen you're main character's as perfect as this, there's no tension.\\n\r\nTatsuya resolves problems without any effort and without any trouble. Any danger that is presented in the series is meaningless as he overcomes it with ease.\\n\r\nMahouka likes to fake danger, like it has some factors against him. It doesn't.\\n\r\nThat's just meaningless words that mean nothing at the end of the day.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime loves to over-explain every little thing. The Light Novel is so riddled with this issue to the point that there are pages upon pages of explanation of something he did like 10-15 pages ago.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters constantly discuss magic and barely anything else, there's no chemistry between any character cause of that. Every single character interaction feels forced.\\n\r\nHell, Tatuya would walk about 2 meters and go into a massive explanation of why it was sooo hard for him. The show loves to make it seem like he sacrifices something for everything he does or that he puts negative effects on his body. But as I said, that's all just words. It's not like that, he doesn't act like anything negative affects him and in the end it doesn't affect him or anything else around him thus it means they're just pointless words.\\n\\n\r\nAnd you know what's appaling? All these huuuge info dumps do not build anything about the lore.\\n\r\nThey're like gigantic text books that teach you the magic... come the f*ck on, that's something the character should learn, not me, go on with the freaking story.\\n\\n\r\nWhat these magical explanations also do is make Mahouka very dull to look at. The vast majority of the show is still frames of talking with no artistic quality put into their presentation. The magical fights are just as boring and dull and have no choreography whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nNot only is Mahouka extremely bland visually, it doesn't have good animation either but the music is forgettable as hell.\\n\\n\r\nThe whole thing is boring and extremely flawed... and all of countless flaws derive from only 1 character... and that's the protagonist. That means they're going to be present forever until the protagonist somehow magically changes.\\n\\n\r\nAre you all wondering why I barely mentioned any plot progression? THERE IS NONE! THE PLOT BARELY PROGRESSES! ALL THESE INFO DUMPS MAKE IT SEEM LIKE ALOT OF IMPORTANT DIALOGUE HAS BEEN SAID BUT NOTHING OF THAT SHIT IS IMPORTANT.\\n\\n\r\nThe explanations for their powers are non-sensical. Doesn't matter how much you try to make it seem scientifically possible... it's not. SO GO ON QUICKLY ABOUT IT AND STOP WASTING MY TME!\\n\\n\r\nMaybe I should mention something about the other characters?\\n\r\nTHEY'RE ALL STUPID ARCHETYPES USED IN EVERY LIGHT NOVEL.\\n\r\nA character is usually that, an archetype who is made unique by having many more traits besides the archetype he/she is.\\n\r\nNow let's say that the characters in Mahouka are just the archetype, without any of the additional traits. That's how bad the characters are. I didn't care about any of them and completely forgot about some even.\\n\r\nOh, also, his sister is also in love with him, that's to further imply how incredibly awesome he is. -_-\\n\r\n(I based this review of 5camp's really good review, because of that some sentences might be strikingly similar but I also gave some of my opinions on why I hate this piece of ass anime).\\n\\n\r\nOverall this show is bad in every possible way and I give it 2/10.",

            "content": "The Irregular at the magical school........Frankly the title alone was a bit misleading, since the main character-in this case Tatsuya was more like a overly protective brother to Miyuki. Whether it is an anime, light novel or manga, we can't deny that this anime is a combination with bits and pieces from \"Harry Potter\" and James Bond sagas, and frankly, the series' combination of Sci-fi with magic wasn't bad except that it lacks one thing........and yes, it lacks a formidable antagonist, also there is the geo-political thing added to this anime where it indirectly concerns Japan's  current conflict with China. But enough of thatas I present my ratings for this anime:\\n\\n\r\nStory:  Fair 6.\\n\\n\r\nOk, high rating is for the anime's story plot where from the first arc involves the conflict between the Blooms and the weeds, where I like the part that them \"Blooms\" got owned by a weed in Tatsuya, however, as the first arc ends the second arc wasn't a bit exciting because the main character become one of the blooms and all of the sudden the conflict between the weeds and the blooms were forgotten. Another thing about the story plot was the fact that it has that geopolitical theme that was present on the last two arc where it indirectly concerns Japan's current conflict with China as I've mentioned, as if writer Tsutomu Sat\u014d was trying to put his nationalist thought into it in which in my opinion is unbecoming of the latter. Ok, so I do enjoy this anime's action-combine with magic and sci-fi, however I just couldn't fathom the fact that in this series where magic is turn into rocket science, which is not bad except that more emphasis was given to most of the blooms and little for them weeds, which is the reason why this part should be fair enough co'z it ain't that good but ain't that bad either.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: Pathetic 1.\\n\\n\r\nOk, so my question is  what's up with the granny dress that them First High schools were wearing? Now, this is probably the only anime where there isn't much moe in it, where the schools girls wear what can be describe as nun- attire and the boys who wears nerdish coat, generally speaking I just don't like the school attire that the characters wore.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good 7.\\n\\n\r\nBasically, the score is for the closing theme in the last arc and the 1st opening theme that I like. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Poor 3.\\n\\n\r\nWhether it is an anime, light novel or manga, on thing is for sure.....that everything was put on the siblings and they are not other than Tatsuya and Miyuki, frankly the two obviously have an incest relationship and there is no denying it. I gave this part a poor score since at first, Tatsuya being able to owned them blooms was exciting, however he becomes a disappointment when he becomes one of the blooms despite of being a weed, though, for him to be this top dog isn't bad, but, he lacks one thing and yes he lacks a formidable opponent and I'm talking about an antagonist who has the capability to kick him hard and make him suffer, unfortunately his portrayal as an protagonist who is the best was seemingly a one side affair where it gets boring when he can kick his enemy's ass like hot knife to butter. It isn't just limited to him where it also includes the entire student council as well who also have their share of being able to defeated an enemy in a snap that also adds to the boring stuff, however the only consultation here is Miyuki whose allure and sweetness keeps ones boredom of this anime at bay.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Decent 4.\\n\\n\r\nDespite of the predictability that the protagonist can defeat the antagonist in a snap, it was still enjoyable enough to finish it up to the last episode, but only barely.l\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Poor 3.\\n\\n\r\nIMO, writer Tsutomu Sat\u014d should have not put any geopolitical theme in this series, also, since the latter didn't put his main character in such hard predicament and by making him have such godlike abilities really proves to be a drag which is why this anime deserves a poor score. Another reason why this anime (including the manga and the LN) should have a 3 was the fact that the title alone as I've mention was misleading, since how the heck can the main character (Tatsuya) be an irregular when he is suppose to be high school student and not someone working a part-time job in some cafe or restaurant, also it wasn't clear as how writer Tsutomu Sato defines 'Irregular\" in his work title,which is one more reason why I gave  this anime a low score.",

            "content": "Mahouka is the worst anime I've ever watched. I finished it just to be able to say this with no doubts.\r\nThe story... well there's no story. There's Tatsuya killing everyone and being flattered by his blind followers. If there's any plot there, you just don't care. The slow pace and flat characters make you forget that there's somethign actually happening.\r\nThe art was the only reason I started to watch this bomb, it looked good... But in the end it wasn't. Repetitive school uniforms, all the students have the same faces, there's little to no facial expressions in any character, the scenery looks always the sameplace. There's also a lot of fanservice boobs.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is some horrible random electronic pop everytime. OPs and EDs completely forgettable. The voices are emotionless and drowsy.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the worst thing I've ever seen in a work of fiction. There's the Mary Sue & Gary Stu couple of perfect protagonists who don't suffer anything bad in the whole series, to the point I wanted to throw a brick on the screen. Or maybe an entire wall of bricks. The others students are a bunch of clones of one another. No importance, little to no personal traits and personality, no backstory, no desires. The only thing they do is to flatter and love Tatsuya onii-sama just because he breathes. The women are the worse: they're all in love with Tatsuya for no reason. And they show it by rubbing their boobs on him. Miyuki is a ridiculously flat and conservative younger sister whose only function is to repeat 'oniiiiii-samaaa' infinitely and then blush. And there's the incest thing, ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww. Also, Mahouka has a very conservative morality, especially for its women, what is ridiculous when you see their boobs popping on the screen. That's just sexism.\\n\\n\r\nThere's no enjoyment. The pace is so slow you can skip 3 or 4 episodes and see that you haven't lost anything important (as if there was something important in Mahouka at all). The whole series could be made in a movie. It would be less painful. 5 anime episodes would be enough to tell the whole thing. I. Am. Not. Kidding. The fights are just random pop playing in the background, extremely boring explanations on magic execution and some guys flying when Tatsuya sneezes at them. When you get to episode 8 or 9 and see this for the 54th time, congratulations! You've seen all of Mahouka. No point getting to the end, that's it.\\n\\n\r\nMahouka wins a lot of trophies: Is the worst anime I've ever watched. Tatsuya is the worst character I've ever seen, and his sister is the second in the list. The soundtrack is also in my list of the most boring ones. See? It's a very prized anime! C'mon, lose your time and watch it!",

            "content": "Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei (translated as The Irregular at Magic High School) isn\u2019t entirely what I see as irregular. Nothing too irrational happens throughout the course of the show and the majority of the cast doesn\u2019t have that \u201cit\u201d factor. Rather, Mahouka does have something we won\u2019t see regularly because of there is magic at high school, or more specifically the Private Magic University Affiliated High School. It\u2019s here where we meet the main characters and siblings - Tatsuya Shiba and his sister Miyuki Shiba. And with their enrollment sets forth this story at an irregular high school where regular things happen and sometimes doesnot. \\n\\n\r\nAdapted from the light novel of the same name written by Tsutomu Sato, the series takes place in a more advanced future in the year of 2095. In this world, magic exists as a sort of technology for both utility and weapons of war. Essentially, the series depicts the setup of the prequel with the aftermath of a world war. And now, magic reigns as dominant source of power. In fact, its concept is held so high in regard that students are separated into classes based on their scores, performances, and skills based on their magic. But hey, it\u2019s a school so students still attend it regularly but with magic as an additional element. Yet, Mahouka has an irrational pacing when adapting its story. By irrational, I don\u2019t mean it as inconsistency but rather by execution. It doesn\u2019t fully come to life when it tells the story and unfortunately lacks a bite to take in what people may expect.\\n\\n\r\nThe first episode doesn\u2019t blast off well. It lacks any sort of wow factor and feels lifeless at hand. Instead, what you get is a mass amount of info dumping regarding the setting and some basic concepts of the series. Rather than telling though, the series explains it in packages. This first arc (known as the Enrollment Part 1 adapted from volume 1 of the light novel) is more like a genre mashup with an overly emphasis that almost forces the viewers to understand every piece of the premise. And to do it that way, they also introduce the majority of the main characters. Besides the Shiba siblings, a host of other characters including ones from the student council make their debut. We don\u2019t know much about them besides their position, some bits of their personality, and in essence a weak general perspective of how we might be interested in them. Then, there\u2019s the weak world building in the first arc with a mass amount of exposition of the mechanics involving the series\u2019 generics. While generic is fine, the show fails to deliver this with comedy. It could have been humorous or at least tried with some attempt at jokes. Even fan service could\u2019ve helped here in some respect. Instead, what you get is pseudo-incest undertones between the siblings. Actually, looking at it from a more perspective angle, it\u2019s often Miyuki that takes the initiative to please her \u201coniisama\u201d. \\n\\n\r\nI wouldn\u2019t say the show is about a cast of characters learning magic. In fact, the series\u2019 story arcs adapt them and give each character some sort of role. However on many occasions, their roles chokes up the plot with their gimmicks. Besides Miyuki\u2019s borderline obsession with her beloved brother, she literally has little to no personality. We don\u2019t learn much about her past either as characterization is fairly weak throughout the entire series. And since the show doesn\u2019t adapt a specific volume from the light novel, we don\u2019t see much else about her from a personal perspective. Regardless, the siblings\u2019 relationship is polarizing as they lack chemistry. Their personalities aren\u2019t compatible and it\u2019s hard to relate to them by any term of realism. In fact, a viewer could easily dictate the duo as a couple. It\u2019s indirectly implied that Miyuki does have forbidden feelings for her brother. Not to mention the fact, many characters makes jokes about their couple-like status. And when that happens, Miyuki\u2019s clich\u00e9 denial and Tatsuya\u2019s indifference obliterates any sort of humor from itself. As for Tatusya though, he has a strict personality with sometimes an authoritative tone when he speaks to others. His commanding presence feels unwelcoming on occasions and can be seen as a man of few words. The way he behaves around others suggests that he lacks an ability to feel strong emotions towards others. (this is in fact true as revealed) However, all of these factors aren\u2019t what\u2019s noticeable about Tatsuya. What Tatsuya brings into the show is in fact his overpowered abilities and skills as a student. Despite failing a practical exam and his inability to use unconventional magic, he has several traits that makes him stand out on a technical basis. The show reveals this during certain situations that becomes obvious as he shows more and more of his skills. Unfortunately, his lack of characterization makes Tatsuya as more of a stale character. There\u2019s little development or focus on him as a person rather than his roles during each arc. In retrospect, Tatsuya is a character that some people might admire for his abilities but hard to appreciate or understand.\\n\\n\r\nBased on a light novel, there\u2019s a certain incentive to adapt everything that fans will be eager to see. As a light novel reader, I can only say that it barely reaches moderate levels when it comes to adaptation. It does adapt some of its main concepts well but fails to reach entertainment levels. The prominent \u201cNine Schools Competition Arc\u201d (NSC) stretches over 10 episodes and introduces many new concepts and characters. While it explores the concepts in their world quite well by actually showing on occasions, it doesn\u2019t do well when it comes with more of its dynamic moments. Most of the games feels relatively fast with the basics and predictable outcomes. Only certain characters stand out despite their already established reputations. Of course, Miyuki and Tatsuya are key players. Other characters that earned a spotlight includes Erika Chiba, Mizuki Shibata, Shizuku Kitayama, and Katsuto Jyumonji. However, their spotlights doesn\u2019t last enough and some are easily forgettable. In essence, their lack of characterization makes them look flat and 1-dimesional with little hope of development. At the same time, don\u2019t forget competition. When it comes to competition, Tatsuya is the epitome of power that only seems to rivaled by a member of another school by the name of Masaki Ichijo. Unfortunately, it\u2019s hard to appreciate their rivalry since the buildup is weak with poorly constructed tropes such as Masaki\u2019s crush on Tatusya\u2019s sister. (no, it\u2019s not even a love triangle since none of the three has any sort of chemistry). It\u2019s just probably best to take it to face value with what the competition as to offer when it focuses on the games themselves. The positive is that there are various games that are offered with interesting concepts during this NSC arc. Not only that but there is also bits of outside jeopardy that becomes intertwined with events of this arc in which viewers might be interested. Similarly, the final arc of the series also has more mature themes with a serious feeling. This should be taken for granted though since the show does take itself seriously. There\u2019s little room for jokes whether it tries die-hardly or not on most occasions.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing to praise Mahouka is perhaps the amount of mechanics are explored. The basis of the CAD (Casting Assistant Device) is presented with great depth throughout the course of the show in various ways. The Nine School Competitions Arc focuses more on its show\u2019s mechanics with new forms of magic such as flight. At its core, Mahouka deals fairly well with its technical aspects. The info dump answers many of the series\u2019 questions whether it relates to spells, classification of magic, Japanese change in culture, and various political topics. There is also a distinctive form of rivalry when it comes to the \u201cblooms\u201d and \u201cweeds. The blooms are the top 50% of the class while the weeds makes up the latter half. The sense of rivalry reaches to antagonistic levels on most times that may keep viewers at their seats to see what to expect. Finally, while the show has oddly placed comedy, there are moments to laud for when it embraces on its subcultural context. This could be expanded upon its mechanics throughout the show that can be creatively intriguing. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation production falls into the hands of Madhouse. For most parts, the visuals makes sense with the general setting and its tropes. Despite being generic, characters does stand out especially for characters of the student council. Miyuki can also be presented as an ice beauty of sorts. The female characters of the series also wear veils to add a bit of cosmetic design to their outfits. On the other hand, most of the characters\u2019 uniforms looks stale and nothing really memorable. There\u2019s also nothing memorable about Tatsuya\u2019s character design for his stoicism. Beyond that, the school\u2019s design itself is fairly regular despite the series\u2019 title. The only other exceptions includes some of the more detailed and enhanced technology later on throughout the show. Background visuals fills its purpose though when it comes to credibility for its setting. Otherwise, there\u2019s nothing praising about the visuals besides the fact that it makes sense on most parts.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack stands out as a more noticeable feature. Just be aware that the voices can be a sting for the ears when you hear ONIISAMA being said over 10 or 15 times during some episodes. However, certain characters has a well-balanced voice that fits his or her personality. The OP and ED songs of the series is also catchy with some foreshadowing and gags. The OST also has a pleasant tone with what is to offer despite some of it being overused or placed at awkward moments. However, the dialogues of the series is cheesy during the majority course of the show. Not even magic can salvage that.\\n\\n\r\nAfter over prioritizing the mechanics of its setting and magic shenanigans, Mahouka will in the end be an average series vacuumed with its even more mediocre cast of characters. What the show has is this interesting premise but it decides to add toppings on toppings of gimmicks until becomes insufferable. Not that the show is entirely terrible though since a few of the arcs has moments that outshines itself with the competition. But with a lack of appreciable comedy and pseudo-incest tendencies, one has to wonder what the purpose of this show is really about. Maybe it\u2019s not trying to communicate that message since some of the episodes are mindless entertainment with the usual gags. If Michael Bay was to direct this series, the entertainment level would skyrocket through the roofs. In the end, Mahouka wastes a promising premise and cast of characters for what it may be worth.\\n",

            "content": "Pop Quiz: What happens when you take a giant sturdy, steel block and throw rocks at it to try and move it? \r\nIt won't move right? The rocks will all crumble, right? And doing it repeatedly will get frustratingly boring, right? Well that experience would still be more thrilling than watching 26 episodes of The Irregular at Magic High School.\r\nBased on the light novel series of the same name, and animated by Studio Madhouse, Irregular at Magic High School, also known as Mahouka is what happens when a writer completely gives up making an interesting story or cast and instead tries to make their maincharacter, Tatsuya Shiba in the case, be on top of things in every situation imaginable. Since so many of Mahouka's problems exist because of this character, and his existence massively drags down any interesting elements the show might have going for it, let's talk about Tatsuya first. \\n\\n\r\nTatsuya AKA Onii Sama AKA Jesus kun mk 3 times infinity, is completely overpowered in every way possible. The show literally says that: \"there's nobody can surpass you in either studies or martial arts\" in the very first episode. But it gets worse. \\n\\n\r\nHe never loses any fight, never shows any signs of emotional weakness, can weaponize magic to be able to fly before anyone else, has a countermeasure for his opponents moves before they even attack, can take a sniper wound head on and heal instantly, can destroy a magic raven just by looking at it, invade people's psyche, can catch and dissolve multiple bullets shot directly at him, develop new technology for their society in secret/make flawless weapons for everyone at his school, has a radar to see where any person comes from, never misses with his weapon, takes down a terrorist organization from the inside singlehandedly, BRINGS PEOPLE BACK FROM THE DEAD, and most painfully, gets nearly every single one of the many girls in the series, including his sister, to never stop talking about him or even falling for him because of how \"cool\" he is. \\n\\n\r\nThe worst part (no, the worst part is a HORRIBLE plot point that comes out of nowhere in the last three episodes, but the second worst part) is that the show's way of justifying all of this overpoweredness is by saying he does SLIGHTLY worse at moving a heavy block across the floor with his mind than anyone else. This \"weakness\" is only brought up in a vain attempt to convince the audience that God Almighty is not overpowered, and it's never mentioned past this or used as an obstacle in any fight he enters.\\n\\n\r\nWhat Mahouka doesn't get is that intelligent audiences won't think a character who always wins is \"cool\". A character is admired for trying, and then eventually succeeding with more effort. Pixar's first rule of storytelling is \"You admire a character for trying more than their successes\", so in turn, a character who always succeeds gives you no reason to admire them or be invested in their growth. Some of anime's most beloved protagonists like Guts from Berserk, Simon from Gurren Lagann, Edward Elric from Fullmetal Alchemist or Lelouch from Code Geass are ones who don't always succeed, and have to learn to overcome their physical and emotional flaws to grow as people. Nothing of the sort happens with Tatsuya, he starts at Square Infinity and his feats keep growing from there.\\n\\n\r\nNow, having an overpowered protagonist doesn't immediately make a show terrible. A writer could use their overpowered character as a joke and build the show around their strength (One Punch Man), you could make your character fun to watch personality wise (Sora from No Game No Life or Alucard from Hellsing) or have an interesting side cast to make up for the overpowered protagonist (again, Hellsing). But they don't take advantage. Mahouka is solemnly serious the whole show, Tatsuya has a dull expression on his face at all times and never truly emotes, and as I'll get into later, other characters have less character than the rocks thrown at the steel block and are made obsolete in the story.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the story itself, it's suprisingly pretty shallow. In 2095, a sizable portion of the human population has died off, but those remaining learned how to use magic as technology and made schools that have competitions with it. Trite. Enter Tatsuya and his sister Miyuki. Because Tatsuya failed that square inch block test I mentioned earlier, he's put in the lower of the school's two classes, and the early parts of the series are all about Tatsuya being seen as the underdog just for being in the lower class because of that BS test method. There's only one other major character in the lower class, and she's taken out of the plot far too quickly. Tatsuya is far stronger than anyone in their world, let alone the upper class, so it gets really annoying.\\n\\n\r\nOther elements of the story include various terrorist attacks, and a high school competition, and while some ideas for the competitions are creative like Magic Bat and the Surf Races, they aren't fun story wise because Tatsuya's overpoweredness transfers to everyone on his team at \"First High School\". Wow. What creativity there in the naming. One of the dumbest scenes in the show (and that says a lot) involves one girl in First High School crying her eyes out for losing in the finals of an event, which might've worked if it was against another school, but it's against the girl's own teammate! She has no reason to cry because their school wins anyway!\\n\\n\r\nOne interesting thing the show does attempt to do is create its very own magic system with lots of types and intricacies, but they also fail because their system of blending magic with technology is incredibly confusing or it's only used to justify Tatsuya winning a fight through technobabble and info dumping. It's unimportant and important in the same story which never works. Something like RWBY, where the characters have two magic powers a piece and their own technology makes it much more clear and practical. Aura for defense, Semblance for a unique power. Mahouka doesn't need such a complex and confusing magic system to make the fights interesting, and no matter how easy the system might've been, it doesn't matter because how strong Tatsuya and his team are compared to everyone else. \\n\\n\r\nNothing is interesting in the story beyond that. Even the various side character subplots brought to fill up the runtime mean nothing in terms of relevance or even development for most of them. How could you make a cool idea about military grade magic weapons into a cliche high school not-harem Jesus fantasy?! It's lazy, cheap, incredibly full of itself, frustrating and boring, and no amount of polished looking techno animation can save it.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the animation, it's not bad, but really doesn't have much to work with. By Studio Madhouse, all of the character designs have a nice polish to them and unique faces with well inserted lips, and the character animation is fairly smooth and consistent. Even some of the technical explanations have very Tron-esque backgrounds that fit the style of the show well. But at the same time, it feels wasted on being given so little to work with. The backgrounds are, for the most part, very unoriginal and standard with little to distinguish them from other future city series, the choreography can occasionally be very flat (in one case literally being two characters walking at each other to shoot each other with guns really slowly), some character designs don't fit for their gender or feel unoriginal, and the flat directing leaves a lot of times where characters are positioned in rooms at very basic angles. Overall, the animation is good, but held back by the source material's lack of anything interesting to animate. Even Guilty Crown, bad as it was story wise, at least had some creative designs and ways to use their animation.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is a similar story. Rising Hope is a solid OP, but it can't hold a candle to LiSA's other song Crossing Field. The first ED and second OP aren't very memorable, but the second ED is actually very nice. In the series, the OST mostly consists of techno and dubstep themes, which aren't really bad but very unmemorable. So overall an OK soundtrack, but what puts it at a 5 is the rather bland delivery from most of the voice actors, and Miyuki's constant need to say \"Onii sama\" over and over again in the dialogue. It gets rather annoying, even if that's more the fault of the script and her \"character\".\\n\\n\r\nAs as characters in Mahouka, everyone in this show is either bland, one note, or a missed opportunity. And there is 0.1% character development whatsoever in 26 episodes. \\n\\n\r\nI've already talked enough abou Tatsuya, but I'd like to add that making him emotionless  only feels like a lazy decision to not have him react to anything and not to actually show subtle character change (Oreki Houtarou from Hyouka). Now to everyone else.\\n\\n\r\nMiyuki Shiba- Tatsuya's sister. Not only the worst character in this anime, but one of the worst characters in any anime ever. And this is coming from someone who watched Mirai Nikki and Guilty Crown. Her only character trait is incest. You heard that right, the ONLY character trait Miyuki has in 26 episodes is loving her brother, being clingy to him, and getting all rosy red cheeks every time he's nice to her. She even rolls around in her bed basically orgasming over him once. It's not even delved into. Even Sword Art Online did a better job handling an incest plot because we actually got to see Suguha's inner thoughts and how she learns to get over it. Here, it exists to be incest, and no other reason. She looks cute, loves her brother, and is the most pure, precious, literal special snowflake with her ice powers. Honestly she's a worse character than Tatsuya! Because at least with Tatsuya, we could understand why he acted the way he did, but with Miyuki we get nothing. The most memorable thing about her is her constantly saying \"Onii-sama\" over and over and over again nonstop. For being the second most important character in your show, this is absolutely pathetic.\\n\\n\r\nNot-Suzaku- I'm serious, the show literally just stole his character design. Basically he's Tatsuya's rival as indicated by the OP. His first appearance had me curious about what type of character he would be as he stood in a room with blood all over the walls, and he had a weapon that kills people just like Kira in Jojo Part 4. I thought he would be some sort of Face of an Angel, Mind of a Demon type character who'd encounter Tatsuya many times and be some sort of diabolical mastermind but NOPE! Mets Tatsuya a grand total of once, fails like a chump, and then he turns into the most generic Pok\u00e9mon rival possible, with whom Tatsuya lets his sister dance with. You had an interesting idea and then you completely forgot about it. WHY?!!!!\\n\\n\r\nErika Chiba- A tomboyish girl with a very teasing personality with a relationship to her brother and a mentor to another character. While by no means a good character, she's the ONLY character in Mahouka to have something resembling a personality and at points she was the most fun character to watch. That said, it's the difference between a two dimensional character with a cast of one dimensional characters, but an achievement for how little it may be.\\n\\n\r\nMibu Sayaka- I brought her up because she's the character who has that 0.1% of character development I mentioned earlier, by realizing that it wasn't right to turn against the High School for their class discrimination based on one test. She could've been a much better candidate for representing the underdog theme, but the show thought it was better to ignore her for the rest of the run save for one tiny moment later, and make Tatsuya the underdog in a laughably bad display. Just another missed opportunity by Mahouka...\\n\\n\r\nNo one else is even worth talking about. All of the other girls do is look cute, stick to an archtype and talk about how cool Tatsuya is. Heck, one girl terrorist literally tries to hack into the First High School system JUST to get Tatsuya to notice her. All the other guys do is make you wish any one of them was the protagonist instead of Tatsuya. The villains are absolutely pathetic, being nothing more than the most one dimensional terrorists and gang leaders and leaving NO impression.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, a horribly unmemorable and generic cast of characters, and those who are memorable aren't exactly well known for good reason.\\n\\n\r\nAfter 26 episodes of watching Mahouka, the payoff was nothing more than a sigh of relief that it was finally over and I could add another series to my Completed list. So in conclusion,\\n\\n\r\n+Overall smooth animation and polished character designs \\n\r\n+First OP and second ED (which aren't even because of the show itself) \\n\r\n+Cool Techno Sequences \\n\r\n+Some decent ideas for Magic Games \\n\r\n+Ends with a bang...courtesy of God Almighty\\n\r\n+Erika is passable but...\\n\\n\r\n-AWFUL main characters: Tatsuya is invulnerable emotionless GOD and Miyuki has less character than a rock \\n\r\n-Horribly generic and unmemorable side characters with absolutely no development \\n\r\n-Fails at the underdog theme so hard that it's laughable \\n\r\n-All important information is given through info dumps \\n\r\n-Villains are the most generic terrorists possible \\n\r\n-Fanservice so pointless you wonder why it exists \\n\r\n-Incest for no reason besides Incest. \\n\r\n-Animation has very little to work with\\n\r\n-Side character plots that literally exist just to fill time \\n\r\n-Manages to be boring and frustrating at the same time \\n\r\n-Stupidly overcomplicated Magic System \\n\r\n-Wastes every good idea it has \\n\r\n-Completely tensionless at every point\\n\\n\r\nSCREW THIS SHOW.\\n",

In psychoanalytic theory, the satisfaction of a desire, need, or impulse through a dream, fantasy, or other exercise of the imagination.\"\r\nI've never written a review before, so I hope this proves helpful to ya'll! For this review, I'm going to be talking about an anime that I watched for quite a different reason than probably most other people. To explore this, I'm gonna go over all the major categories - hopefully, by the end of this review, you'll have a helpful understanding of the pros and cons ofthis anime! Please keep in mind that I've watched the anime up to it's most recent episode (14), and I've not read the LN, although I have looked up some info on the wiki to clarify some points. I'll do my best to keep this spoiler free.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 4\\n\r\nBy itself, the story isn't bad. In fact, if you were to remove the male and female MCs, the story would probably shine. However, story and character are inevitablely inseparable, and thus must be judged in light of each other.\\n\\n\r\nI personally found the story to be engaging. The first arc flowed well enough, and the second one is also doing a fair job of keeping my attention. People have said there are pacing issues, but I haven't really found this to be the case. Worldbuilding (especially the magic system) has been done really well - it's very obvious that a lot of care and detail went into the world to make it work so logically and tacitly. The lore is very interesting, and I genuinely want to know more about the world of Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei as the show goes on. Then again, there are a HUGE number of plot holes as well. A lot of the show seems to have been made up for the purpose of plot and convenience, and so a lot of things don't make sense. Here's a short list:\\n\r\n1) Why does First High have a First and Second Course program? Only the Firsts get magic trainers, but to enroll at the magic-oriented university in the first place, you have to be exceptionally good at magic. That's like saying a typical university takes only people who get 35s and 36s on the ACT, but only provides classes and instructors to those who got the 36s, and everyone else gets to take Shop classes forever.\\n\r\n2) Why is the Bloom and Weed discrimination only perpetuated by a few of the cardboard cutout characters (which is discussed below)? I thought it was supposed to be a school-wide problem?\\n\r\n3) Why even HAVE a Nine Schools Competition when First High has the absolute best magicians? Like, this isn't a matter of subjective opinion - First High only accepts the absolute best. This competition is desperately trying to mimic the Tri-Wizard Tournament from Harry Potter, but in HP, it made sense. After all, the British magic people went to the British school, the French magic people went to the French school, etc. In Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei, this is not the case. And indeed, as we see, First High can only lose due to repeated (um, where are the referees?) sabotage due to hostile third parties.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, a HUGE problem is that there is nothing at stake in the story. Since both the male and female MCs are so insanely good at pretty much everything they do (with a few exceptions), nothing is being risked at any point. There's no uncertainty over what'll happen, there's no fear for the MCs' safety, and more unfortunately, there's no unpredictability. Everything is painfully obvious from the get-go. While other animes with OP MCs will at least throw them into some peril, this is absolutely not the case in Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei. Fights are over in under ten seconds each (which isn't bad, but there's no emotional involvement as a result, especially since the MCs always win), and dangerous situations happen to others or are also resolved in under ten seconds.\\n\\n\r\nSuspension of disbelief is one thing, but when I know what's gonna go down even before the episode happens, then there's no reason to care much for what's going to happen. This is due to the MCs, which I'll discuss in a little bit.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nThis, honestly, is one of the show's two strongest points. Everything is gorgeous, the magic looks fantastic, and the animation never dips even when action is scarce. A lot of love went into making this world look and feel fantastic, and the vibrancy of the world is truly a pleasure to behold.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nMany people seem to judge a show on the OP and ED, but I personally skip OPs and EDs to avoid spoilers, so I'll be judging Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei by the actual sound. Which is fantastic as well. All of the effects are crisp and visceral - the pops pop deliciously, the crackles crackle with fervor, and overall, the sound does a phenomenal job of bringing the world to life.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 1\\n\r\nThis brings me to the biggest problem of the anime, and the reason for my original dictionary quote at the beginning of this review. Every. Single. Character. Is flatter than a sheet of paper. And while the male MC does have an intricate backstory, his overwhelming ability annihilates any interest I might have in him. But even worse than this is the way everyone treats him. As a writer myself, it's very hard to avoid making a Gary Stu; due to the fact that we as writers want to write what is most natural to us (ourselves), and we want to live adventures that are only possible for our characters. So writing yourself into a super awesome character is very easy to do.\\n\\n\r\nThis does not make it excusable.\\n\\n\r\nEVERY. SINGLE. PERSON. In the anime absolutely ADORES the male MC (except for his rivals, of course). And they take EVERY. SINGLE. OPPORTUNITY. To tell him how awesome he is. I'm not exaggerating on this. The MC gets complimented (and I don't mean a \"good job\" kind of compliment, but a \"you are so amazing I wish I were dating you or better friends with you or more like you\" type of compliment) OVER and OVER and OVER and OVER and OVER. At least 2-5 times per episode. And yes, the male MC is superpowered, but that doesn't justify the kind of foot-worshiping we see in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOn a base level, this becomes aggravating and wearying very, very quickly. But on a deeper level, it takes an unfortunate chunk out of the story. Without giving away too much, there's one point in the anime where the male MC does something absolutely extraordinary by completely revolutionizing a concept previously thought impossible. In any other anime, this would be grounds for the MC to be amazing and for your admiration of that MC to grow. However, due to the constant barrage of incredible feats the male MC consistently performs in Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei, this major revolution comes across as flat. Stale. Uninteresting. There's no room for significant praise when such praise has been unendingly heaped on the male MC from episode 1. This is a very clear example of severe wish fulfillment.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the female MC, she's about as deep a character as a puddle of water. And she has about the same amount of charm too. Her main purpose, aside from PWNING N00BS, is to ceaselessly praise and talk up to the male MC. Like, ALL the time. In the second episode, she is given a great honor, but instead of accepting it graciously, she throws a fit that the male MC isn't being recognized for his awesomeness instead. And actually, she does that in episode 1 too. And in other episodes. This female MC only backs down when given a commanding nod from the male MC, which clearly means he is her superior in every regard. This is also a very bad case of wish fulfillment.\\n\\n\r\nThis wouldn't be so bad if she was a servant or indebted to the male MC somehow, but the kicker is that she's... his sister. His younger sister. I get that sibling relationships are supposed to be good, but the male MC is clearly the female MC's idol. I'm not even gonna talk about the incest between them, which this anime clearly is in favor of. Such incest is a design choice, and so I'm willing to accept it as part of the story. But the female MC's foot-licking toward her older brother comes off as possessive and creepy.\\n\\n\r\nPeople relate to characters who have flaws, and despite the desperate assertions of Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei, neither of the MCs have any real flaws. The male MC's absolute lack of emotions could be considered a flaw, but the fact that everyone still loves him regardless means that it really isn't a flaw. The male MC's lack of skill in a certain area of magic could be considered a flaw, but the fact that he still is insanely OP means that it really isn't a flaw. The male MC's social aloofness could be considered a flaw, but the fact that he's described as absurdly handsome and a chick-magnet means that it really isn't a flaw. Etc.\\n\\n\r\nAs for every other character, I genuinely can't remember a single name of anybody else. And I'm usually pretty good with names. The only exception would be Ririka (or something like that - I could look it up, but then again, this is a great example of how underdeveloped the other characters are) - she actually comes off as interesting and slightly multifaceted compared to the other characters. Then again, that's not saying much in this anime, but regardless, she serves as a breath of fresh air in an otherwise lifeless and stale list of cardboard cutout characters whose only purpose is to populate the much more interesting world of Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and the villains are overwhelmingly under-established. They have poor motivations, awful direction, and almost no planning. What were the villains up to in the first section of this anime? Something about magic and equality? Something relating to terrorism? I'm not quite sure. And as for the villains in the second part? That hasn't been revealed yet, so I honestly can't comment. But it seems like a persona vendetta against the MCs' school, which also doesn't make sense.\\n\\n\r\nBut I've gone on this for long enough.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2\\n\r\nI really, really wanted to like this. I very much did. The magic system is remarkable and impressive, and the world itself is interesting and engaging. But absolutely abysmal characters, non-existent character development, and a mundanely routine plot served to detract sharply from any charm the world might have had on its own. What truly sinks the ship, however, is the flattery of the male MC. While this might seem as nitpicking, it happens on such an exaggerated and persistent level that it honestly causes me to literally moan aloud every time the male MC is worshiped by his fans (which happens multiple times per episode). It's so forced and jarring that it kills any immersive qualities Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei might otherwise have, and it causes me to constantly look to see how much more of the episode is left to go. If the ridiculous and never-ending compliments were removed, as well as the obsessive sister MC, this show would be much, much, much, much, much more enjoyable.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3\\n\r\nThe art is awesome, and the sound is phenomenal. But the awful and wooden characters, the lack of any character development whatsoever, and the completely predictable story serve to tank what could have otherwise been an impressive and fun anime. Overall, all the ingredients for success are found here, but absolutely nothing good is done with them. Instead, negative elements are thrown in - meaning that in the end, like with an uncooked cake, all you have left to eat is a soppy, flower and sugar and egg goop that has been further poisoned with toxic nuclear waste. An extreme statement, I know, but hey - at least it's on par with the compliments given to the male MC, albeit in a negative manner instead of a worshipful one.",

            "content": "Ah Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei (hereafter Mahouka). I'm going to start off this review by saying this is the worst anime ever created - this is THE worst anime ever created. Don't worry though, while the review will be largely negative, I'll hopefully be able to convey why I think this is the case with as little bias as possible.\r\nMahouka's story follows Tatsuya Shiba and his sister Miyuki. They're in their first year of First High, which is the top school in the country for magicians. This is it. There isn't really much of a story, but rather several story arcs which don't really connectin any way. This lack of overarching story isn't technically an issue. Some of my favourite shows also lack an overarching story - Lupin III, SoreMachi and so on. The problem with Mahouka is that none of the story arcs really contribute to anything. They kinda just tell a story (albeit very slowly) and finish. The first story arc was introduced us to discriminatory practices within the school. It was just extremely silly considering all students that go to First High are the top 1% in Japan, yet the top half discriminates against the bottom half. They don't provide much characterisation beyond what we know already about the characters nor do they end with anything that'd help us learn more about the world our characters inhabit.\\n\\n\r\nWhich leads me to the characters. In a word: boring. In a few more: none of them really develop. Again, not developing characters is totally fine, but in this case, your characters need to be interesting. Unfortunately none of Mahouka's characters are particularly compelling. Tatsuya is a Gary Stu - he's the strongest character in the show by far and puts no effort into achieving anything. He's the smartest and strongest character in the show. If another character dares to achieve something in world of Mahouka, they will attribute their success to Tatsuya helping them out as seen about a dozen times in the second story arc when some girls in the school win some sporting events. Even in shows like No Game No Life or Sword Art Online, the Gary Stu still looks like he has to put effort into achieving their goals - Tatsuya never breaks a sweat, even against enemies that are hyped up to be extremely powerful. To be fair, Tatsuya is so perfect that he was pretty fun to watch in the first episode - his ability to flirt with girls and his overall charming personality. But this got old fast and it was never really as good as how it was done in episode 1. The rest of the characters are just there to tell us how awesome Tatsuya is. Seriously, I'm not exaggerating. Every single episode has at least one mention of how good Tatsuya is at something. The character who does this the most is his sister Miyuki, who I should mention, is in love with him. Therefore I don't believe any of the other characters are really worth mentioning. There's a whole heap of them, but none of them are really distinguishable from each other.\\n\\n\r\nWhich leads us to the visual side of things. The character designs are rather generic. I think Tatsuya looks kinda cool despite that, but the rest of the characters look like they could've been lifted from any other magic school show. The art isn't too bad, but there's nothing very standout about it. Animation is where we have problems. This show is made by Studio Madhouse who are well known for their great animation. We're given glimpses of this animation quality early on in the show with some decent fight choreography in episode 1. It's disappointing then, that this all goes downhill. The animation has no personality in it. For example, when we're shown the school bus driving down the road, there are no other cars on the road. It's just an empty road. Or when our characters are out on the streets, there are no people hanging around. There is very little action in the show, but even when there is, it has very little animation, but rather is an amalgamation of still shots, flashes, close ups and looped animation. The animation gets progressively worse as the show goes on. Even the cinematography is rather weak. In a dialogue heavy show, cinematography is somewhat important so we don't get bored. The new iteration of Fate/Stay Night understands this to some extent, but Mahouka doesn't. The majority of the show is thus a head talking to the camera.\\n\\n\r\nStill with me? So let's get to why this is the worst show ever created despite already looking pretty bad with the above. The show is all talking. Now now, talking again is not inherently a bad thing. If the characters are talking about interesting things (like philosophy, or details about the world), or giving us background information to set things up for later, that's totally fine (in most cases). However, the characters in this show talk non-stop about magic. When magic is cast, one of the characters needs to explain how the magic works in full detail. This can take anywhere from 1 to 5 minutes or even longer, depending on how complicated the magic being used is. This is incredibly poor storytelling. Not only does our knowledge of how this magic works not important to the story, it's incredibly boring to sit through a mini lecture on things that don't really exist. Boring is one thing, but if it doesn't contribute to anything later on, what is the point of telling us how the magic works? If the explanation for why Tatsuya can run super fast is because he can strengthen his legs with magic, I'm sure no one would complain - that's a satisfying enough explanation. However, an explanation the show gives us would include talking about the absolute fundamentals of what Tatsuya does - creating psion waves which are the basic forms of magical energy and shifting them to the feet where waves of energy are released upon the foot's contact with the ground at a 45 degree angle - I'm sure you understand by now. The explanations are just too long and unnecessary, especially when they're not crucial for our enjoyment of the show.\\n\\n\r\nDespite wanting to be taken seriously, the show can't help but have it's fair share of generic high school hijinks. Mahouka is a harem. None of the male characters get any significant screen time except for Tatsuya, and all other female characters are either in love, or appear to be in love with Tatsuya. As a result, you get silly little moments like walking into a girl changing clothes, girls being embarrassed when they themselves wear skimpy outfits (skimpy used in the loosest sense of the word), inability to convey feelings and so on and so forth. These moments aren't even done as well as other series that have them. If you're looking for fanservice, you're not even going to get that, unless you think close ups clothed boobs are better than close ups half naked ones. One interesting point does derive from this however and that is some of Miyuki and Tatsuya's flirting. I personally found some of it pretty funny because of how sarcastic the flirting was. Apart from this, all other attempts at humour fall so short, it never passes the starting line.\\n\\n\r\nAs a general rule, I would urge everyone to stay away from this show. I've seen my fair share of bad anime and Mahouka takes the cake. Why then did I finish the show? It was a morbid curiosity with how bad an anime really can be. This is the sort of show that isn't so bad it's funny. This is the sort of show that is so bad it's boring. If you have 26 episodes worth of time to waste, I'd recommend giving this a shot. If you'd rather not waste that time, I'd give another anime a go because Mahouka is not satisfying in any way whatsoever.",

            "content": "It seems that for years now, there has been this trend of light novels receiving adaptations, and given a lot of these adaptations, this trend gets a bad rep. Yet, out of all the things in the trend, this has to be the worst of them all.\r\n*SPOILERS FOR MAHOUKA KOUKOU NO RETTOUSEI.  THIS REVIEW WILL BE TITANICALLY BIG.  ALSO, DON`T WATCH THIS SHOW. IT IS NOT WORTH YOUR TIME*\r\nSo, many people hate light novel adaptations. Yet, this anime seems to not get the scorn shows like Absolute Duo, The Asterisk War, and other hated LN adaptations. Why is that? Why do people hatethese adaptations in general? Why does this deserve their hate? Well, we won`t find the answer to the first question, but the second one will get that treatment. So, let`s find out, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 1/10\\n\\n\r\nWe begin with Tatsuya and his sister quarreling in a beautiful school environment in what feels like an emotional climax in your average shoujo high school manga, but lo and behold, the first signs of incest have arisen. Plus, this is an awkward way to start off the show, for reasons that I just went over. It is 2095, and magi-tech has taken over as our way of life, sports, and combat. Side note, this may be a bit pedantic, but this show needs to know the difference between regular magic and magi-tech. Literally everything here aside from recreational combat and hand-to-hand combat is magi-tech but they refuse to address it a such. The methods of magic usage are inconsistent. Also, sometimes they use the CADs to initiate magic, but other times, they do it on their own despite the fact that CADs are supposed to be the only way to use magic. No one makes this problem more apparent than Miyuki, Ichijou, and of course Tatsuya, and the final arc is where that becomes particularly egregious. Well, there are 3 arcs, one about introducing students and explaining how the hell stuff works, a sports tournament arc, and a school and military vs terrorists arc. None of which are particularly interesting at all. In fact, all of them suck donkey dick. Let this long ass story section go over why, starting with the fist 3 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 1 is just combat and introductions, and aside from bad combat and shoving 5 combat system down our throats without explanation, it`s relatively lukewarm, albeit, it sets up things the show doesn't follow through well. It introduces the discrimination between magically adapt magicians and less skilled magicians, only for the rest of the show screw that up and then forget about it after episode 14. Now, for the problems of episode 2. At one point, the Student Council hound Tatsuya to join them. Tatsuya gives literally every single logical reason he shouldn't join the council, all of which are more than enough to make a reasonable person agree with him, but they egg him to join regardless, and of course, they get him. There is one major mistake in the fight in this episode. That being:Remember when one of the girls said \"No weapons\" as a rule of a magic duel? Then why the hell are they allowed to use guns? I shouldn't have to explain why this is wrong, since that is self-explanatory.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 3 starts off with a long ass info dump to explain the episode 2 fight that ended instantly. Speaking of long info dumps (which are while standing and talking or sitting and talking),the info dumps are constant, and are the only way we learn information. This is not a good way for a show to make us understand the intricacies of its combat, magic, or tech, especially when they go on for minutes beyond end, amounting to nothing more than a glorified PowerPoint with far too much on each slide; the information is nigh-unobtainable due to the piss poor methods.so much of this series is just sitting/standing and talking while nothing is going on, even if there isn't an exposition dump. They do this at minimum twice per episode, always lasting at least 2 minutes each. This is the fastest way to consistently bore viewers, like, of course, myself. Like I said, it's bad enough that they do this during info dumps (which are already far too prevalent) but they do this when not much new is being presented, and coupled with ill-fitting music, this above all else, makes this goddamn abomination a chore to sit through.This episode is the one that introduces this issue to us, as well as another one.\\n\\n\r\nWhen they DO explain info like in episode 3, it's in the form of boring and long exposition dumps post-battle that fail to properly engage, plus the fact that they often take too long to explain anything anyway. When things are proven impossible to justify, they shrug it off. Plus, sometimes, they take way too long to explain things that demand it in order to be acceptable. One such case is Tatsuya`s instantaneous self repair. Tatsuya's self-repair system is BS. Then again, that\u2019s little more than a minor nuisance at this point given everything else in this armageddon to the integrity of the industry. How does one fail like this? Sure, there are other problems here, but they lie with the characters.\\n\\n\r\nI could easily keep going, breaking down a lot of things that destroy every episode's logic, like how in episode 5 Mibu does a poor attempt at explaining her goals despite that the obvious examples being right there (like how the magically adapt students discriminate against those less fluent in magic and how the school is doing so little to help prevent that aside from sending out people to deal with brawls despite the fact that it is in direct violation of school rules) or how Kirihara\u2019s revealed motivations in episode 6 for being despicable in episode 3 clash with his actions and demeanor in episode 3 completely, but not only do you get the point by now, but I would lose all sanity trying, even if there are notable exceptions I'll cover. Besides, there are plenty of other problems that deserve their own paragraphs to say the least. \\n\\n\r\nEmotional climaxes like the one in episode 6 aren't given the proper buildup, weight, or execution they need for those moments to work. That one in particular would've been interesting if Mibu actually grew to realize her wrongs in her fight against Erika, and if the fight ended on a fair conclusion, while Mibu started remembering via this fight why she picked up her sword in the first place. Speaking of emotional climaxes, why does Shizuku (a nigh-emotionless loli, I`ll get to that generic point eventually) cry when she loses to Miyuki in episode 14? It makes no sense and wasn't even built up to be the emotional climax of the second arc. Also, I mentioned episode 1 and the combat, but here is a more detailed version of it.\\n\\n\r\nThey shove approximately 5 combat systems down our throats without any explanation into any intricacies or things that set them apart (I get that it's the first episode, but this is how you handle this kind of stuff poorly) making us demand explanation as to how this all works that way we're not completely lost. Plus, they keep introducing more in the first 2 episodes without explaining the previously established combat systems, and it takes forever to know how any of this works, like, again, with the Tatsuya regeneration BS. By the end of episode 5, we have 7 combat systems, and only two of them have any details shown to us. The 3 hand-to-hand systems aren't distinguished from one another, another one is military magi-tech, and the last one is regular military equipment, which you'd think they'd be down with given all the military magi-tech and other magi-tech that can be not only just as lethal, but more effective as well. By the end of all this, we mix it up with a goat robot and a way to use the dangerous magi-tech in regular, non-military combat, and it still sucks.\\n\\n\r\nI'll touch on this in the character section, but Tatsuya is such a Gary Stu (nigh-infallible and OP AF) that it causes rage to anyone who tries to see the reason in anything here, especially since a lot of these moments make no sense no matter which way you look at it. The worst example of our protagonist being the world\u2019s worst Gary Stu is in episode 9 where he reveals himself to be Taurus Silver.. Doesn't that mean that he was a super-duper magi-tech genius ever since he was about 6, and no one but Miyuki and Tatsuya's employees know about this, and he's been developing some of the world's finest magi-tech and CADs as well as military magi-tech ever since that age, and no one has caught on?! In the finale, they do an I do dump that's supposed to make Tatsuya look tragic because of his power, but it fails massively.\\n\\n\r\nIt`s pretty apparent that this piece of sh*t has a nigh-innumerable amount of problems so I clearly won`t get to all of them, but here are some other ones. The magic system is super complicated, and the info dumps and inconsistancies do not help here. RWBY and Fairy Tail had more comprehensive and consistant magic systems in place, and that is only one reason those shoes are better, but that isn`t entirely relevant here, much less, the point I was trying to make. The incest is obvious, and not funny, as they try to make it, yet they don`t even have the balls to go anywhere with it. Moments like the conflict about Hanzo vs Tatsuya are generic AF. onto the final few episodes. There is no sense of transition between any of the last 4 episodes, which messes with the pacing. Other stupidly random stuff (like mechs) are added because this show isn't stupid enough as it is. Plus, the pacing of the final 5 episodes is horrid, and the finale is rather bleh, as per usual with an average episode of this show. Also, before you blame the source material, multiple people have informed me that the source material was good and that the anime made so many awful omissions and changes (chief among them being Tatsuya becoming otherworldly in terms of OP-ness), so this was also terrible as an adaptation. Way to go, Mahouka. You suck even more!\\n\\n\r\nAnd we`re nowhere near done with the buffet of grievances this show presents. I am running out of both patience and sanity right now.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 1/10\\n\\n\r\nThere is almost nothing good about the cast of this goddamn show. Let`s start with Tatsuya, shall we? Tatsuya's personality is \"Gary Stu + calm down Miyuki + blunt guy who doesn`t entirely understand jovial social queues. What\u2019s worse, in the manga (or better yet, the original light novel before becoming a manga), apparently he\u2019s an introspective character, meaning that our perception of him is more so due to his thoughts on certain situations rather than his demeanor, as his personality is expressed through his head. Such a shame that Madhouse took out that element for most part and made him boring as all hell, as it was the only interesting thing about Tatsuya. Hell, his Gary Stuness gets even worse the more we progress, like his physically impossible hacking skills, his random inventing of the flying spell overnight without any explanation as to how he did it, and surviving a fatal sniper shot and dispatching of him after shrugging it off in a matter of seconds, and even more BS! No, seriously, he is the ultimate Gary Stu. Kirito looks like Shinji by comparison, it is that bad. At least Kirito has struggles and even losses during his battles, but Tatsuya effortlessly cheeses almost single fight, sometimes instantaneously. Plus, he has his own harem too. Another bland and uninspired quality. It is really impossible to sit through this without questioning at least something, unless you like having a boring ass God Mode MC without a clear and defined personality, or you genuinely don't care about what you watch.\\n\\n\r\nNext, *sigh* Miyuki. Miyuki's only traits are: I romantically love my awesome brother but don't feel comfy showing it, respect my brother otherwise I get furious, and I'm sorry for literally everything I say and do. The moment I lost all respect for her was when she flirted with her brother and then proceeded to attack him because he was having fun talking with other girls. Just, wow. Plus, she\u2019s a Mary Sue, effortlessly trumping every opponent in every match as well. To think that someone as beautiful as her would be such a pathetic character. What. A. Shame. The other characters band and one note as hell. The only interesting ones are Kyouko (only relevant in arc 3 but is easily the hottest girl here), Kirihara (irrelevant past episode 7 until finally being a badass again in episode 25), Haruka (some relevance in each arc), and Mayumi (some relevance each arc, and gets some stuff done, more so than most non-Mary Sue protags.)\\n\\n\r\nOther potentially interesting characters like Mibu are wasted due to poor decision making of them being shoved out of the limelight by the real protags who don't even have much development or fleshing out. Erika was one of the livelier ones, but she got progressively bitchy in the second arc, and episode 15, where she\u2019s a complete and utter BITCH to her brother and to Mari, just so happened to be the episode where I lost any ounce of respect for her, until quickly trying to bring it back, to some semblance of effect. The Student Council vice-president, Hanzo is initially such a prick that goes out of his way to judge horribly based on class status, and be a complete hypocrite, that it's absurd how he was allowed to even be on the council. Then again, a surprising amount of them are assholes that hardly have a right to be here, like that one dude that is such a prick to Tatsuya and is all \u201cus blooms are superior to you, Weed!\u201d (he even gets a full conflict about it that goes nowhere). Sure, Hanzo mellows out, but he's just as uninteresting as the rest of them. Jumonji was meh for most part, but I do not take kindly to the not so subtle attack on those like me, who question a show when it violates it's logic and makes no sense, that he did in episode 18, to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nThe antagonists are your typical generic 95% off bargain bin brand baddies, like a lame manipulator that turns out to be a little bitch once his plans are foiled, and a bunch of old corporate dudes doing nefarious things for money while being boring and being in a circle (reminds me of those guys from Death Note episodes 18-25). The final antagonist, Maya, who was built up via OPs and dialogue doesn`t even show up until a cameo in the last few minutes of the finale for some lame ass sequel hook because of course this would be an incomplete adaptation, am I right? Doing that in a light novel adaptation seems to be all the rage, isn`t it?\\n\\n\r\nART: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nI can hear you right now. \"But Code!\" you cry. \"The art and animation is brilliant!\" you continue. \"Surely you aren`t that petty or blind, surely you jest, right?!\" you passionately conclude. Well, you might be doing that about me ripping off Glass Reflection, but let me explain why the art and animation category has such a low score here. It`s not for the character art or the regular (and ok) animation itself, but for everything surrounding that.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is obnoxiously bright. Seriously, it's like they increased the brightness up to 11 here on their TV  and decided that that would work for the show. There\u2019s a time and place to light up a scene, and almost none of them exist here. Ufotable is the master at this, with Fate/Zero and UBW using this to excellent effect. Here, whenever it's used in a scene (since it's used in literally all of them minus one or two, one of which is where they use city lights, admittedly well I might add), the ratio of it working to not working is 1:99, no hyperbole included. It is very oversaturated, and that gets hard to deal with. It uses and overuses the type of bright lighting that would be used for an impactful moment. It gets to a point where occasionally, the characters don't look like they're part of the scene, looking like they were awkwardly plastered on there like bad CGI. Speaking of which, the rest of the CG is pretty bad too, except for the snowflakes and other actually well done effects in the EDs. \\n\\n\r\nThe backgrounds are horrendously blurry that coupled with the horrible CGI classmates that spawn often and the egregious lighting and bland character designs, it literally hurts my eyes to watch at times. The fights don't even have good choreography (especially most of the hand-to-hand combat scenes), except for episode 6\u2019s sword fight, and a lot of them go by in a complete flash, leading to annoying anti-climaxes, like the fights in episodes 2 and 3. This, along with literally every other problem I have with the art makes every scene increasingly excruciating to watch. I have a hard time because it forces me to sometimes squint my eyes in order to handle the obscene brightness present in certain moments (especially Leo running in the OP). \\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nThey sorta butchered LiSA's song, Rising Hope (OP1), even if the song itself is good, even though they didn`t do the best job incorporating it here. OP 2, grilletto, by GARNiDELiA, is pretty awesome, except for the awkward battles in the OP (another knock against the art section) and for the fact that it doesn't ultimately fit. Why wasn't such great music on such a putrid show? ED 1 is generic and bleh. ED 2 is rather meh as well, so, whatever. The actual OST is F*CKING AWFUL!. The techno songs suck ass and get both annoying and over-played. Plus, some of it feels very out of place, like super pleasant music in a boring exposition scene about the Student Council or, again, the techno. Even potentially good music suffers from that issue, which is a travesty. Also, I DETEST the song with the GOD DAMN BEEPING!! It drives me of the frickin\u2019 wall! Incessant ass beeping. Who the hell even out that as part of an OST? WHO THE HELL KEEPS ASSAULTING MY EARS LIKE THIS?!?! GYAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!!\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 1/10\\n\\n\r\nThe show is so dull that the only other emotion I get is sheer frustration as literally everything else I mentioned above, and watching it fully made me realize that this is one of the worst shows ever made, no exaggeration. Each episode is as dull as the last, and in some cases, even more aggravating. I find it tiresome to question so many of these scenes but all i feel is bored, annoyed, and tired. This show drains you, especially with all of those info dumps and other moments of just talking without anything happen (each being around 3-5 minutes long and there being on average, approximately 2 per episode). Even the action is stupid and dull, along with basically everything else, when it isn`t laying down a particularly frustrating moment on me. I wasn`t even satisfied that it ended, it was that draining. Ironic how the art can be so bright but everything else can be so dull. When you make a show, you want to entertain, but it feels like they deliberately tried to do the opposite. The production feels spiteful, and I can feel them all not caring about this wasteful product. They didn't even come up with creative titles! Just (insert arc name here) part (insert Roman numeral here). No other show has done something so shameful and lazy, to my knowledge at least.The dialogue being robotic as hell (just listen to the first scene in episode 1 again for clarification) doesn`t help either. This show can rot in hell!\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 1/10    RAW SCORE: 5/100\\n\\n\r\nOver the course of this review, I mentioned several cliche aspects about this show that also permeate other generic light novel adaptations. The OP self-insert protagonist, the harem surrounding him, CGI robots, generic characters, incomplete adaptation, loli that either doesn`t show too much emotion (like in this particular case) or complains about puny chest size (lets her friend nearly get groped because the friend has bigger tits than her, so its sorta here too), a tsundere character that does it to at least one character, a character getting slapped for accidentally peeping on a girl in a nigh-fanservice scene.  It`s all here! That`s the thing. It is an amalgamation of all of these cliched, annoying, tropes in all these shows we hate; a Frankenstein of these tropes and more! It is not only dull and stupid as hell, but it doesn`t even haver much of a true identity, much less a soul! Even Fairy Tail, as much as you can bash it for all its problems, has some life. It's a crime that it was allied to have nice animation put into the magic, OPs, and EDs, when the rest of the art sucks, the music sucks, and the rest of the show is irredeemable, top to bottom. This show is pathetic, a tumor that plagues the industry, embodying all that we hate about LN adaptations. That isn`t to say that LN adaptations can`t be good; Fate/Zero is downright amazing and it was a Light Novel adaptation. Still, I think you get all of my points, right? Before I bid you adieu as usual, I have one last quote to share that sums up my feelings for this show. Well, Goodbye.\\n\\n\r\n\"IT\u2019S TIME TO STOP!! IT\u2019S TIME TO STOP, OKAY?! NO MORE! This...this needs to stop! This needs to stop, now! THIS IS CANCER! This...is so much cancer that I can feel the tumors growing on my back, AND IT\u2019S NOT OK!\" -Francis of the Filth, 2015.",

            "content": "Mehouker Review:\r\nMINDSET:\r\nLight novels are a shift media, as they mass produce the same tasteless product for the mass appeal, as we anime critics just sit there, and are forced with casual opinions into the face.\r\nSYNOPSIS:\r\n21XX it is the magical century, a century in which magic has been advanced into extreme levels of power has become the Earths main source of power, research, finances, health (etc.) and because its a Light Novel Adaptation, highchools. We centre around two siblings, Tetsuya and Miyuki in a near incest relationship who are dealing with such current affairs, trying to adapt to the changes of there world and have Yourtypical high school light novel adaptation \u201cFun\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nREVIEW:\\n\r\nLets start of with one of the most obnoxiously large crowds of cloned opinions in the Anime Comunity, \u201cTetsuya\u201d he is this amazing magician who can utterly achieve anything without looking like a downfall, and is the one most OP character in the series. My problem?\\n\\n\r\nThe show tries to have mysterious situations, foreshadowings and plot holes to keep You invested from the bigger picture in which is trying to build tension, but Tetsuya is so OP and so omnicient, and always looks like he too barely to no effort takes so much away of the tension and what the Anime is trying to pull.\\n\\n\r\nAt least  the writers were clearly having fun with how OP Sora was in No Game No Life, or how the JoJo's did it with style, and how Loenghram had a very sensitive emotional double-edge and not just being one of the smartest fleet admiral in history. But in Tetsuya's case, he is near to emotionless and drops all sense of tension, mystery because he is so OP that he can almost do anything like its the back of his hand!\\n\\n\r\nEvery time the writers finally decided to give the probability of Tetsy losing a battle, its like the writers all of sudden pull out plot armor out of there buttocks! (as if he isn't OP enough, even the director had to make him more OP to milk the fans) Like how Tetsuya gotten shot from the chest by a sniper, he turns back time when before he was shot and it clearly looked like Tetsuya was dead since the bullet shot through he's heart!\\n\\n\r\nTetsuya even lack the character appeal of having barely to know personality as a pseudo three dimensional character, being this completely empty persona and whose only existent emotion was he's sister. \\n\\n\r\nIf there was anything that I truly hate between the differences of a lightnovel and an Anime, its when they use there conventions WAY too often, we have the quiet girl, the tsundere, the tomboy, the kind spirit, the cool president, used about a 100 times in an Anime, and a 1000 times in a Light Novel. There are a few male characters, but pffft who care about them? Its not like they have there very own fan club or fan base!\\n\\n\r\nAll what the audience truly cares about is this pseudo three dimensional character beating all competition as the most predictable outcome ever. No need for such horror to be placed under the plot if such character has powers on par with an alternative and superior being!\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is just being pretensous by having all of these small details of how the powers work, and a very super in-depth explanation about them to somehow make them look cooler since this is magic and science being combined and jazz, though it may sound cool on paper it can become rather tiresome for a while as the explanations start to feel more boring, more confusing and convoluted as it feels more like a boring science lesson that seems to draaag. Even if You somehow managed to like it, You may still feel the fact that You may have forgotten of such knowledge and when they revisit other pieces of science, it can become even more confusing as they leave plot holes feel unanswered, like whats with the CAD? Whats with these psion waves? And why the hell is pushing ever became so flipping complicated?! I see it, then forget it.\\n\\n\r\nBy this point, I don't even care about the show since it was so horrible to begin with, I don't care if Tatsuya dies permanently, I don't care if there school gets destroyed and I definitely do not care if Miyuki gets raped by main villain.\\n\\n\r\nEver since Death Note, it became a true demonstration on what Mad House can really do with there computers. And Mahouka seems no different, though time for this kind of Animation no longer feels as impact full or as strong as it is back then. It feels like an upgraded version of Your regular animation which I commend around a 5 or a 6 for, it has better lighting, shading, models, backgrounds, colour schemes, action scenes etc. Character designs feel pretty generic, but its super easy to tell who is which.\\n\\n\r\n The only gripe I can give for such a style, would be that it feels a little too reliant on its CGI to make quality backgrounds, and it can sometimes feel rather artificial at times. There were moments when it really stood out, like how they made ice to be so threatening, and cool at close ups. Though moments like these are far from between, the budget feels very consistent!\\n\\n\r\nThere's nothing too special about the music, all what I really remember was a nice piece of dubstep whenever Tatsuya does something super cool. The first opening gets me super hype every time, (despite the show being so bad) and screw the second Opening! First and second ED were pretty boring for the most part, so just skip it actually.\\n\\n\r\nLEGACY:\\n\r\nThis is like every Light Novel Adaptation, the only difference is the occasional emotionless OP protagonist to spice things up, when in reality its failing. If You ask any similar Anime or light novel for Mahouka, then its every single 21st century Light Novels that have ever been made.\\n\\n\r\nSCORES:\\n\r\n3/10- For mass cloned characters, and badly written protagonist\\n\r\n2.5/10- Uses basic techniques, but explanations become far too convoluted and tension? There is no tension. \\n\r\n7.510- Mad House is simply MAGICAL.\\n\r\n6.5/10- Above average with an awesome first Opening.\\n\\n\r\nFINALE: 3.5/10",

            "content": "When you usually watch anime, a common problem the comes up is lack of explanation, better known as plot holes or missing information.  Anime does this major fault a lot due to the constrained timeframe that they have, confining so much information into a 30 minute window for however amount of episodes ranging from the normal 12-13 to the ungodly long amount of 700+.  Usually, all the details of a certain subject are never fully explained, which leaves much to be desired from the audience.  But sometimes...things can go the other way.  One of these examples is in Mahouka Koukou noRettousei, or, the Irregular at magic high school.\\n\\n\r\nStory (6.42/10): The story of Mahouka, or rather, the base idea is rather simple.  In a world in the future, technology has advanced remarkably.  Technology has gone so far that the things it can do can be considered in today's time to be...magical.  It is because of these extraordinary properties that the technology is called \"magic.\"  It is here that two siblings named Shiba and Miyuki enter a high school for up and coming magicians so that they too, can advance their studies in the wonderful technology that is...magic.  \\n\\n\r\nAt the beginning, this story intrigued me quite a bit.  The actual story idea was interesting and different from anything in the spring season, so I thought that this would be a good watch.  (Plus, it's 26 episodes, so it can entertain for quite a while.)  But as time went on, the series sort of...deteriorated.  There were four MAJOR flaws that the series had, and it was because of these flaws, that the show just went completely downhill.  \\n\\n\r\nThe first flaw is the idea of Magic.  Now, as contradictory as this sounds, the idea of Magic was a big problem for the series.  The reason?  Time.  For a good twenty or so episodes in the series, half of the actual run time/episode was devoted to explaining magic.  Every aspect such as the Psions (whatever those are), the CAD's (supposed \"magic wands\"), and cast time and magic sequences, relics...ugh...  To put it in simple terms, the series tried too hard to explain its sort of roundabout focus, leading it to be over explained, and most of all, boring.  In my opinion, watching a series where the characters talk about stuff that didn't feel completely necessary to the plot just didn't interest me.  \\n\\n\r\nThe second flaw is the plot itself.  Because the series spent roughly half of its run-time to explain magic, the plot suffered majorly due to the sheer fact that there wasn't enough time to show all of the necessary plot details, leading to massive plot holes and confusing plot lines.  In addition, the three arcs that the series featured weren't even different from one another.  One arc was about discrimination, end it up with terrorism.  Another, an olympic style event, end it with terrorism.  And finally, a public presentation, end it with more terrorism.  In addition to having to me, what seemed to be a recycled plot idea, was the fact that the supposed terrorism was being done by what looked to be nameless groups of generic, \"oh, we're the bad guys!\" who didn't seem all that threatening since they get their asses kicked by children.\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally, the final flaw was the ending.  You know, when you get a \"Read the light novel/manga ending\", people tend to get angry because well, the story's incomplete and they want to know how it ends.  This...was one of those cases.  The series is left so completely open ended that it wasn't even funny.  The entire plot was wrapped up in the span of two minutes with a bunch of details left out, leaving a huge, gaping hole as to what really happened during that time.  Plus, there were an absurd amount of plot convenience that made the show a bit too ridiculous.  Pacing was decent though.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Great plot idea\\n\r\n+  Decent pacing\\n\r\n-   Over explanation\\n\r\n-   Not enough plot (leading to plot holes)\\n\r\n-   \"read the manga\" ending\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (6.45/10):  Characters were also a huge flaw in this series.  This is mostly due to the fact that there were so many of them, both major and minor, that it was hard to keep track of them due to their varying amounts of screentime that varied from character to character.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, first, we must talk about the main character, God, I mean...Tatsuya Shiba.  Tatsuya is a kuudere male character; very obvious from the start.  From the beginning of the series, we can see him as being the cool guy that doesn't show any emotion, who also serves as a bodyguard for his little sis'.  The only problem is, it's boring.  There is no change in his character from start to end, so much so that he doesn't even smile.  (not once.)  There is no character growth from start to finish, and he just seemed so lackluster due to the amount of change that he could've had.  While I understand that that is what the character is supposed to be, it just seemed boring to see our main character be so...platonic.  In addition, his character just seems to be a world of plot convenience because his very existence has the ability to solve problems or major disputes.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd finally, we have his sister, Tatsuya Miyuki.  Miyuki is a very opposite character to her brother.  Miyuki is a character that is quite reliant on her brother.  As her brother's protectee, she is more \"vulnerable\" one and seeks out her brother whenever she wants an opinion for something, or just straight up companionship.  (She's supposedly incestuous, but there isn't very much wincest as far as I can see.)  Apart from her ice magic, there wasn't really anything I found to be really remarkable about her, since her whole character is wrapped around her brother and how much she cares for him, leading her to be reliant on her brother for development, which in and of itself isn't saying much.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast for Mahouka faces what I call Angel Beats Syndrome, which entails too many side characters that are quite interesting, and a main character who isn't as interesting.  Mahouka has a lot of side characters, which I feel was a big fault in the series, since none of them really get completely fleshed out (apart from maybe like 1 or 2), and most of them just sort of fall into the category of \"helping move along the plot.\"  Several characters like the ever so bombastic and awesome Erika, to the ever so coy Saegusa actually had very interesting personalities and backgrounds that were never really used and had so much unused potential due to the fact that the actual plot was very lackluster.  \\n\\n\r\nThe villains of the series were practically non-existent to be honest.  Even though they were supposedly villains,(with the evil chair sitting and their evil plotting), they never really showed themselves often and had motives that didn't seem clear or were either completely unknown to the audience.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the characters were an incredibly mixed bag.  Some of them were very interesting, others were there just to move the plot along in some way, shape, or form, some of them just seemed like they were just...there, and others were interesting initially, but had no growth which made them quite boring characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Very interesting side cast\\n\r\n-   Boring main characters\\n\r\n-   Unexplained villains\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound: (8.21/10 and 7.22/10):  Mahouka was created by Studio madhouse, the same people who in the same season, created No Game No Life.  (guess they have a pension for cliffhangers over at madhouse)  And, as expected by madhouse, the animation is fantastic.  The animation for the show goes towards the white gradient, and as such, has a very almost shiny color to everything in the series, which looks rather nice.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, the show uses some 3-D animation side by side with the normal animation of the show, which actually melds quite nicely without any sort of awkward or funky images.  And one final thing, I have to congratulate Madhouse for making those magic circles or ringlets because those things are fantastically designed, and they look gorgeous.  \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of sound, the music for the show is rather decent.  The two openings for the series were nice to listen to and added a nice feel for the show.  (Personally, I feel like the first opening sounded better, and was more fitting for the show's feel.)  For the endings, the soundtrack sounded good as well, but and fitted well with the show as well.  (Similarly, I think the second ending fitted the show's feel better.)\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Great animation\\n\r\n+ Good soundtrack\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment (6.33/10):  Mahouka had a good first impression on me.  The idea of taking a \"magical\" theme and making it into a sci-fi/technological show seemed like a very interesting idea.  I was quite intrigued by the plot and saw a lot of potential in this show.  But, as time went on though, the show grew more and more complex, and more and more confusing and less and less enjoyable.  In the end, the open-ended ending was the final nail in the coffin the ultimately left a bitter taste in my mouth.  \\n\\n\r\nDid I like the show?\\n\\n\r\nIn some sense, I did.  The animations and the soundtrack gave some fantastic aesthetics to watch the show in, and the idea of the show, while overcomplicated, was still a nice, original plotline that was still very interesting to watch.\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about the show?\\n\\n\r\nThe plot for me was a big mess.  There were an absurd amount of plot holes, and the two siblings were rather bland characters that didn't have as much depth as they could or should have.  Above all, while the \"magic\" part of the show was interesting, the show did spend an absurd amount of time explaining it, leaving only half of the run time to run the story through, which ended in a rushed nightmare that made the story feel very incomplete.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this show?\\n\\n\r\nWell, yes, actually.  While there were many unfavorable things about the show, in the grand scheme of things, the show was still watchable and had some interesting points to it.  The show was no means a fantastic show, but it wasn't bad in any way.  If you're a fan of sci-fi shows, this show would probably be a good fit for you.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: (6.44/10)",

Honestly it shouldbe a 1 but I didn't want to put everything I had a problem with as a 1 so I didn't. The story is very slow and features tons of exposition about the magic featured in the world. These were huge problems for me but I could overlook them. The real problem I had with the story were the themes. Discrimination is a big one in the episodes I watched but, I didn't really understand why it was a problem. The show opens by saying that even getting in to the school is extremely prestigious and gives us a scenario in which the better students or blooms treat the \"bad\" students or weeds pretty terribly. That doesn't make sense, if we go by the introduction in the very first episode every student there is better than the average person, even the weeds. There are other horrible messages this show puts forth and, it also tries to politically indoctrinate it's viewers by shoving meritocracy and capitalism in their faces everywhere but, I don't really want to write a book about how horrible the themes of this show are so, I'll move on.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 6\\n\\n\r\nThis is probably the only thing that this show does well. The magic looks cool and the school uniforms are unique compared to other high school shows. How the characters looks apart from the uniforms is pretty standard though.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 4\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I don't remember the soundtrack being good or bad. I gave it a four because it seemed like the appropriate rank for neither adding or detracting from the show, which is all I can say about it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 1\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are the weakest point for this show. Yes, the main characters are OP... we've all seen it before and, we even have another show from this season that featured OP characters (NGNL), why is this show's OP main characters worse than all of the rest of them? That's because Tatsuya isn't interested in having meaningful interactions with any other character in the show (besides his sister, I guess) and, Miyuki is only interested in her brother. See the problem? Why even have other characters? I don't know, because it's a school and, it would be weird if they supposedly went to a school and, were the only people there. As you can guess all other characters really aren't important and are only there to show you how much better than everyone else the two MCs are. I could stand them if they were your standard OP main characters but, they aren't. Miyuki is an annoying character whose only point in the episodes I've seen is to fawn over her brother so there isn't really much to talk about besides the fact she's annoying. Tatsuya on the other hand is a truly awful character. What really made me hate him completely was his speech about the equality \"terrorists\" in episode 4 (maybe 3, i don't remember). Basically, he says that equality is a farce and, the only people who wish for it are the people who didn't try hard enough to succeed. That message coming from Tatsuya, who is born with power and ability that far surpasses everyone else in the entire world completely disgusted me. Miyuki and Tatsuya explain that magician deserve their higher economic standing because of the \"hard work\" they put in to develop their talents which is a complete joke because you have to be born with an affinity for magic. Essentially these characters are just terrible people who justify the power given to them by their family by saying that it was their hard work that got them to where they are while dismissing everyone else by saying \"You just didn't try hard enough.\"\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 1\\n\\n\r\nIf you couldn't tell, I detest this show and, did not enjoy it. Usually, I can see why someone might enjoy something but this... I just can't see anything redeeming about this show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 1\\n\\n\r\nA terrible story with terrible themes, standard art, a sound track that does nothing for the show, and awful characters add up to a horrible experience.",

I have liked anime where people have supernatural powers and I felt this one should be suitable to add to my list.\r\nThe first episode was charming. Although different from other animes I'm used to, I liked the art. (Okee, the art of animes like Fairy Tail or HxH isnt breathtaking either..)  The main character came across as mysterious and a powerful underdog character that would grow throughout the storyline. At least, this is what Iexpected. \\n\\n\r\nWhat felt a little odd to me was the brother-sister romance the writers wanted to picture. I couldn't really relate to their relationship as it seemed more and more romantic rather than sibling love. As an older brother myself I felt disgusted seeing this. But hey, maybe it's an cultural difference..\\n\\n\r\nAs soon as the arc really started off, the excitement started to grow.There were more duels between student and the spotlight towards the main character began to lighten up as well. This arc was fun to see.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, as soon as this arc ended my interest in this anime ended as well. I couldn't hold onto the excitement of the following storyline and I couldn't relate to the main character or any other character for that matters. It felt that I wasn't spending my time optimally while watching this anime.\\n\\n\r\nAn anime that catches me is mainly due to plottwists or cliffhangers, whether I can relate to characters, or its just plain fun supernatural action. It looked promising, but unfortunately to me the anime lacked in all of those aspects.\\n\\n\r\nOverall rate: 5",

            "content": "Story: (7/10)\r\nMahouka Koukou no Rettousei is about a brother and sister duo that attend a magic academy in their first year, in the year 2095 magic is common and interwoven with science and used in everyday life. The series is split into smaller arcs within the 26 episodes with the first couple of episodes focused on introducing the characters, then moving on to an inter school magic competition and then finally developing a bit at the end using the characters to start on a deeper plot with a small scale war. The ending of the anime suggests that there is more seasons planned after thisone as it introduces more characters that are essential to the backstory and development of the main characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are introduced slowly in the first 2/3 of the series and the relationships of the supporting characters are only developed a little bit however it is very heartwarming to see some of the characters warm up to one another, I think the wide cast is introduced well enough that we can enjoy watching all their small antics. There is actually no character development for the main character at all, however as the ending suggests, if more seasons are made for this anime, I think there will be much more interesting development for the two main characters.\\n\\n\r\nSound: (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending themes didn't strike too special, however it wasn't bad. The music during the anime reminds me a bit of games where if the battle theme starts up, you know stuff is about to get serious and it pumps you up, over all good soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nArt: (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was very beautiful and I spent a lot of time watching the characters eyes and the gradients that were used in the art. The Magic sequences and seals were very well drawn. The art style definitely draws you in.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nI managed to watch the entire thing and it didn't feel tedious at all, I actually wish it was longer so that more of the story could be revealed, this needs a second season definitely and they have set the story up in the first season for a second season. There is not much comedy in this however and much of it is just really well drawn action scenes, sometimes it's refreshing to see an overpowered character smash through everything.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nI think there is a lot of potential for the company to make more of this series and continue from the ending, and I'm sure they will. I enjoyed it and didn't find much that I didn't enjoy about it. The lack of character development in the story and the overpowered main character I think will be balanced out later on with more story and a second season, however for now it does drag down the series a bit that Tatsuya does not seem to have any weaknesses or development at all this brings down my overall score a little.",

He had some special ability (hidden power). Everything looks good at the start of the anime but the story didn't seemed to progressed at all. 26 episodes seems too much as there is not much explanation on the character's background unless there is another season. \r\nThe most important thing is not sure whether you guys have noticed or not but the guy and his sister are way too strong, for the first timei am feeling mercy for their enemies. There was not a single time when the guy ever gets beaten or revealed his full strength. Still both siblings are too overpowered. I think the guy is not needed after all, his sister is more than enough to deal with all the enemies.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime had potential if the story was more of a dramatic.

            "content": "Mahouka, huh? Known by many people as the supposed \u2018AOTY\u2019 after Shingeki no Kyojin and Sword Art Online, it tries to appeal to everyone, whether or not they watch anime on a basis. Aired as a two-cour, it started on Spring 2014. I wanted to watch it as it aired but due to commitments, I really couldn\u2019t and I had to put it on hold. Finally, I had some time a while later and I took the opportunity to marathon this long series.\r\nThe story starts in a futurist setting (literally 2095 - that\u2019s mad) when the Shiba sibling pair, Tatsuya and Miyuki, starts their highschool experience. The two are put in different classes that teaches magic different. While Miyuki is placed in First Course, which is recognised as students with high magical skills, Tatsuya was placed in Second Course, despite being first in scoring the theory examination. They meet new characters as they continue their school lives, and from then on, things start to get interesting.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of this anime splits into three arcs, filled with the intended action. As the arc progresses, it usually gets more serious and eventually more characters show up. A little tip when watching Mahouka: as long as you don\u2019t spend so much time trying to memorise all the characters, you\u2019re fine. (I\u2019ll touch on that later.) Each arc tells a different story and they follow a typical \u2018introduction-problem-solution-conclusion\u2019. There is a lot of explanation into magic which may either bore or excite you but I wouldn\u2019t care much about it, unless it relates a lot to the story.\\n\\n\r\nIndeed, a lot of people have been criticising Mahouka because of the story. I have to agree that it has some problems. One of it being that there are some parts of the story left not elaborated or kept as plot holes. I wasn\u2019t really satisfied of how the story went because of how it was executed. Occasionally, I felt that the story forgets a certain point and just moves on. Another problem is that the story is sometimes predictable. Some factors have arose to this problem, including the characters\u2019 personalities and actions. Predictability is always a problem in shounen anime, and Mahouka fell for it.\\n\\n\r\nAnother huge problem about Mahouka is the pacing. Many have said that the pacing for this anime is too messy. While there are parts where a lot of explanation and dialogue were used to slow the pacing, there are also parts which misses some points that may confuse the viewers due to the amount of action added and so this rushes the story.\\n\\n\r\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, but I absolutely love the setting, although there are similar ones out there. Sure, it could\u2019ve been weird at times, but it tried to vary the content they want to showcase. But with all these problems, it basically screws the whole story up.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said before, more characters get introduced in every arc and probably in every episode. It\u2019s tiring, I know. I would like to categorise the characters in three sets: the main, the supporting and the minor. The main characters are the Shiba siblings, of course. The supporting characters are those who involve themselves with the siblings and to what has been going on in the story. Finally, the minor characters drive the story so that at least there\u2019s some content to look up on.\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters have some form of a backstory which isn\u2019t largely told as the story moves on. And as they start school, they seem to cling together as \u2018sibling love\u2019. The depiction may have led into many misinterpretations such as incest, but truth be told, Miyuki\u2019s personality shows that she totally loves his brother a lot.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem with the story has to lie with Tatsuya. You may have known already, but Tatsuya is definitely overpowered. It frustrates me looking at the way he never puts himself in much danger because he\u2019s basically indestructible. He brings himself to the battlefield like there\u2019s never a serious consequence to follow. He fights against his enemies and at the end most of the time, he feels like nothing has happened. You have to wonder: why is he even on Second Course? It\u2019s really stupid to see him in this way, honestly.\\n\\n\r\nMiyuki, on the other hand, does nothing much really. Aside from being with his brother and showing affection to him all the time, she gets herself involve in some fights, crazy ones included. She doesn\u2019t seem to fit like a main character at all, hence it feels like the story just revolves around Tatsuya alone.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting characters are a good bunch. The characteristics vary and they seem to be pretty cool as you are introduced to them. These characters have been supporting the Shiba siblings since the start of the story. At different arcs, they have different roles of playing in the story. Each arc focuses on a set of characters that relate to the events leading in the story. It\u2019s hard to remember all of them since it\u2019s a huge cast, but all you need to care if how they are involved in the story.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s seldom character development in the main characters because of their personalities and actions - they act as how they act overall in the story. The supporting characters may have showed some development but it doesn\u2019t give a role in the story. It\u2019s honestly disappointing, since there is some potential in Mahouka. I know that many shounen anime are like this, but Mahouka really have some potential in making the characters more brighter and varied.\\n\\n\r\nLooking at the art in Mahouka, it isn\u2019t surprising that it has some nice quality. The sceneries all around look great, both exterior and interior, and I like the atmosphere around them which makes the scenes alive. The colour choice looks a bit stale, like there\u2019s no beautiful touch at all. The character designs are nice as of what you expect in a shounen anime. Most of the time, the emotions expressed by the characters are good.\\n\\n\r\nMahouka combines technology and magic and both of them work alongside. It\u2019s creative in the sense that there are a variety of magic a character can spell out. In action scenes, the magic captures brilliantly. There\u2019s some cool smooth animation that follow as well.\\n\\n\r\nBefore even starting the marathon, I already fell in love listening to Mahouka\u2019s first opening. Rising Hope, sang by LiSA, is catchy and the instrumental is awesome. Her vocals are strong and it matches what you may have expected watching the anime. The ending song is totally opposite. Millenario, sang by ELISA, is such an emotional song. It may have been weird since there\u2019s nothing in the story which invoke such feeling. I love her vocals so much in the song as she sang fluently and the instrumental is great and dramatic. It\u2019s hard to love the second opening and ending more because their predecessors are too awesome to loop. GARNiDELiA\u2019s grilletto has a similar feeling to Rising Hope, and if you have heard their \u2018ambiguous\u2019 opening song from KILL la KILL, it sounds almost the same. Rei Yasuda\u2019s Mirror is great and it\u2019s more cheery than Millenario.\\n\\n\r\nIf you know Taku Iwasaki, you may have recognised Mahouka\u2019s background music. Overall, it is awesome. With the varying genre from techno to classical piano, the background music knows what to play in a particular scene. If you\u2019re sick of techno, you may be disappointed that music on most action scenes are based on it. The voice acting is good too. The voice actors did well in expressing their characters\u2019 thoughts and emotions well enough. They are a number of well-known and experienced voice actors, so you wouldn\u2019t feel let down.\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, with the let-down of the story and characters, you may expect that I didn\u2019t enjoy Mahouka at all. While I see that many do hate it after watching a full around, I think that you shouldn't be too serious when watching it. It just blows your mind off with this much explanation to remember, so lay back and watch for the action.\\n\\n\r\nI personally enjoyed the first arc a lot. There are certain parts of the story which are uncalled for. The next two arc gives off a lot more problems, hence I felt a bit bored watching after a while. Hence, I\u2019m having mixed feelings after finishing Mahouka. While I definitely love the setting the story holds, the execution is very disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nBut who cares, right? This anime is too famous.",

            "content": "I felt compelled to write this review as a counterpoint to all the negative reviews this anime receives. \r\nFirst off, it is a hard anime to understand at first as it gets very science-y explaining how all the magic works and you get lost in the technical terms a bit. Bare with it. The biggest thing I couldn't figure out at first was what the CAD they kept referring to was so if you haven't seen it: a CAD is a Casting Assistance Device. Basically the devices they use to cast the magic. They can be anything from a cellphone looking device to a gunto watch to a baton or sword. I can say I enjoyed my second watching more than my first.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I love this anime and it is easily in my top 5 of all time. It does a little bit of everything, from sci-fi to action to school days and even a bit of romance and it does all of these things quite well. I have re-watched it completely 7 or 8 times and every time I pick up on something I missed the first time. It's that deep. The main character Tatsuya hits all the right notes for me. He is not naive. He is not emotional. He is not a lovable kind-hearted child who still thinks the world is like disney movies and only can make morally correct choices. If you like that feel free to watch almost literally any other anime because that trope has been done to death and I find it either annoying or frustrating now. I like the progression that builds up to the final arc and slowly reveals just how underestimated Tatsuya is. While they spend a good deal of time on introducing characters and developing relationships in the beginning, they never overdo the romances or the humor like most anime do. nothing comes off forced, it's all very natural. When it gets into the action in the later episodes it's very gritty and real. This anime is not afraid to show graphic violence and death and nobody cries about it after. I could keep rambling about what I enjoy about this show but suffice to say there is a lot to like about it.\\n\\n\r\nSome of its flaws would have to be its initial complication, but after so many viewings it wound up being something else I liked. The main issue with it for me though is that the other characters are never really developed. At the end of my first viewing I kind of couldn't remember who was who especially because a lot of them look the same. As there is quite a lot of them, it's only the first season and everybody wears the same uniform it's forgivable. The lack of development also makes it hard to care about them much but I have to say it's refreshing how it doesn't force your hand so to speak, as most anime do. They never drag you through a filler episode for some 'B' character's background story. Also it ends just as it's getting awesome. And it's weird that you never see any faculty at the school. That's really all I have. \\n\\n\r\nThe main arguments against it seem to be that it is slow or has a weak plot and that the main character is extremely overpowered. I can't agree with any of these statements and if people saying them had really paid attention to the show they would see it actually addresses these concerns. The ending arc, which is where all the action is, actually begins building up in the first arc. It's done in a way that's very easy to miss if you aren't actively thinking about it. Something you might dismiss as meaningless conversation or vague inner thoughts will usually make a lot more sense later on, or even the second time around. Suffice to say, the show alludes to more than it actually projects or reveals. As for the main character, he is very powerful yes, but they also state that there are about 50+ others on his level and each country or alliance has at least a few people equally or more powerful. The only people you have to compare him with the whole time are basically other first year high school students who had led somewhat normal lives where it is explained numerous times both mains had a very different upbringing. This isn't a dragon ball z thing where it's just gotten ridiculous (and everybody loves dbz). Almost everything tatsuya can do his peers are capable of as well just not at their age and experience level, with a few exceptions both ways.\\n\\n\r\nI'll conclude by conceding maybe this show is not for everybody, as is the case with almost everything but its flaws are greatly exaggerated. It requires you to actively think about whats happening and make connections yourself. It is not like every other anime where characters are so easily definable. It doesn't paint an easy black and white picture of it's world and society therein. There is no accelerated love story or childish panty humor. In a way it's just as enjoyable for what it's not. I give MKNR a 10/10",

After watching eight episodes and not being able to take it anymore I began reading reviews here to see what people thought was so good about it, but I found mostly the reviewers feeling the same way I do.  \r\n     I finally got around to watching this about a week ago because it had a lot of hype and I heard it was supposed to be very good, and I was super disappointed.  From the start, the main charactersseem too perfect and the \"bad guys\" all seemed more relatable than anyone on the \"good side.\"  This actually kept me watching for eight episodes because I was waiting for Tatsuya to realize he was on the wrong side of the equality argument in the show and change sides, having to fight his friends and loved ones, however, nothing changes.  \\n\r\n     It is a parade of Tatsuya being perfect to the point of ridiculousness and having no real obstacles to overcome.  I was rooting for the terrorists trying to gain equality in vain though, as the fights are about as one sided as you can get.  The artwork was great, though, I will say that, but art is just a bonus for me, story is the important part and this show fails miserably to tell a story that is engaging.",

            "content": "(Spoiler free)\r\nThis anime abounds with interesting intellectual ideas, including the equality-ideal mirage, deterring effects of excess emotions on performance, socially constructed morality and its price, and \"power\". People say Tatsuya of this anime is the most over-powered character in anime industry (Unfortunately, they're just being ignorant. Have you not seen Modocka the world?), this makes a good place to see how immense power can play out. For these qualities, this show will broaden your outlook on life. It will not do much more for you, I'm afraid.\r\nThis anime also entertainment value, as hinted by its popularity. I believe in \"ArtAdmittism\": Art (including anime) is mostlyuseless to an individual's growth, thus it must only be judged by the emotional joy it activates in the brain of the individual. In other words, Art is created to stir the desired emotions and it is good to the extent it does so.\"\\n\r\nThis anime did this to a great degree for me. The badass attitude of Tatsuya the perfect activates the mirror neurons, resulting in great enjoyment. \\n\r\nMy greatest recommendation for you: Do not bother with anime reviews. Just check the genres, summary, general weighted score and give it a shot. This is a heuristic to choose anime, and it is the most efficient one I have found. And please spread this heuristic, because it will save a lot of time for a lot of people, and they'll enjoy seeing better anime (Search in the google for why a heuristic can turn less into more). Thank you.\\n\\n\r\nPS: I do not mean \"ignorance\" in a negative way. We are all ignorant. We have to admit it. You can search for \"the turkey illusion\" and the \"black swan\" for more evidence for this.\\n\\n\r\nMy old review (Don't bother by this one):\\n\\n\r\n(Spoiler Status: NA)\\n\r\nFirst I have to say,I am a fan of the original LN and I have decided to write this review,because other reviews by people who have not read Light Novels is really doing an injustice to this anime.\\n\r\nThe story here is made of:Interesting Characters (As a whole) - A highly Overpowered protagonist (Which his true power won't be shown in this season,I believe) - His bro-con sister (Which can be annoying or desirable,based on VIEWER's viewpoint,and I did like her very much) - A good Si-Fi Magic theory - Fast battles focusing more on how someone wins,not that someone wins or loses - Some big issues which likely aren't going to be solved (Like the conflict between protagonist and Yotsuba,USNA threats,Miyuki's fears of future which are real and serious,...)\\n\\n\r\nSo,let me honest and brief and fast: This anime is for persons:\\n\r\n1- Have read novels \\n\r\n2- Like OP characters and/or Mary Sues.\\n\r\n3- Are not narrow-minded enough to dislike the 'certain' relationship between protagonists (Which is kinda one-sided really)\\n\r\n4- Are not looking for battles in this\\n\r\n5- Like theory-based fantasies (Which are a rarity,I think.Take harry potter for example.It doesn't have any real theory behind its magic.Why the hell is that voldemort so strong?There are lots of people who can kill easily with magic Avadekedavra (?).)\\n\r\n6- Like sound and art\\n\r\n7- Have accepted wish fulfillment as a good way of having enjoyment in a world so cruel that all dies and nothing remains.\\n\\n\r\nWhy I insist on reading novels?The anime does a very bad job at developing the characters,explaining the magic theory and more importantly explaining who Shiba siblings (protagonists) are and why the hell are they so powerful.\\n\\n\r\nStory is not that great in my opinion,but still is good.\\n\r\nIf you liked novels,do watch anime.It is highly enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nNow you can consider this review finished and I would be happy if another fan edits and polishes this review and republish it here.\\n\r\nNow I go and answer some of the criticisms of other reviewers who plainly have not read light novels (May contain spoilers).\\n\\n\r\n\"We are special, we are awesome, but our society doesn't appreciate us, everybody is against us, so we will show them what we can do, and win all the time, and have all the girls call us awesome.\\n\r\nRead more at http://myanimelist.net/anime/20785/Mahouka_Koukou_no_Rettousei/reviews#YuCF4rGrEUciefRR.99\"\\n\\n\r\nThat is kinda right for the viewer but is not at all the case with the protagonist.He IS appreciated highly by Research companies,national army,powerful individuals,his sister and later on pretty much all his peers.And he actually is trying to hide his abilities (Which are on highest grade,not 'smart' techniques) and never wants to be in spotlight in the first place.He does zero work at 'showing them what we can do'.And either gender calls him awesome and he really doesn't cares.\\n\\n\r\n\"Having an OP main character is the death of any story, period. There is nothing the rest of the cast can do if he is around and in this case HE IS AROUND ALL THE TIME. Just imagine that in an episode we are allowed to have a duel between two girls, just because Tatsuya didn't bother to capture the bad girl himself in a fraction of a second. Other stories will try to make it seem like the MC can die, or focus on other characters for awhile, or at least not make it seem like it\u2019s all too easy. But not here. Here it is all about Tatsuya doing everything effortlessly and everybody being amazed with him.\"\\n\\n\r\nThat is basically the draw of story.If anyone doesn't like it,do stay away.But i can not get the idea how \"Other stories will try to make it seem like the MC can die, or focus on other characters for awhile, or at least not make it seem like it\u2019s all too easy.\" is a good thing.Those stories are much shallower in my opinion and they are just trying to make false tension.Here,yes,none of these weak highschoolers can beat Tatsuya but that doesn't mean he is invincible or can protect everyone he wishes (Though of course,those things are not brought in light because the show inclines to be happy).That is perfectly natural,only if you knew his unique stance.But to know that,you need to read the novels.\\n\r\n\"Tatsuya doing everything effortlessly\" is also completely false.He has worked really hard and payed very high prices for his power.However,you of course can not see that effort in combat.It's just like a exam.The one who worked the hardest, will do the test most effortlessly.Got the point here?(Again,anime does not mention his hard working.)\\n\\n\r\n\"So the only thing you get in this show is a guy effortlessly brushing off a few school bullies, under the surveillance of the teachers. There is literally nothing to feel excited about.\"\\n\r\nAnd this guy happens to have decided the outcome of 3 large-sacle battles.Why just can't this person understand he has only seen 5 episodes?\\n\\n\r\n\"School settings in general are sapping away all tension and ruin the atmosphere.\"\\n\r\nThe settings will change in more serious parts.And well,that is part of the core of story.Erase it and you will have another story altogether.\\n\\n\r\n\"They are supposed to be there to offer a haven and familiarity for teenagers but at the same time raise endless questions of the sort \u201cWhy does everything happen the way it does, and why the adults don't do anything to stop it?\u201d And the answer is a simple \u201cbecause adults are terrible people who create unjust societies, and only we, the hormone-crazy teenagers, can do the right thing by smacking the crap out of everything.\u201d\\n\r\nWell,above is not right,however is not completely wrong.There are adults who do things (Kazama,Fujibiyashi,Yotsuba's butler,police,...).However,our protagonist is a strategic-class magician,so it's natural for him to do some 'adult' work.Here we also have children of 10 master clans and other elite students who have the ability.Above statement doesn't get that the adults in this school are much more weaker than their students (As they have become high-school teachers,they can't be anything special after all).And well,age fades in the face of ability.\\n\r\nIn parts though,I agree heartily to above sentence and that is the case with almost all of shounen animes.\\n\\n\r\n\"Furthermore, the themes are not even presented properly. For a society that runs on meritocracy, the mages of that school are all rare and gifted. There is little reason for the Weeds to feel bad, if they have powers that place them above every other mundane person. And even the most gifted of them, the Blooms, are acting like they are constantly threatened by the Weeds, as if their position can be snatched away if the errant boys try really hard and surpass them. If they really are superior, they shouldn't feel threatened. And if hard work can indeed make Weeds surpass Blooms, then they shouldn't have casts to begin with. These double standards are very easy to spot and because there is a lack of an actually threatening conflict, you are not even distracted from realizing that. This is what makes this plain bad fantasy empowerment.\"\\n\\n\r\nIndeed true to some extent.However \" hard work can indeed make Weeds surpass Blooms\" is pretty much impossible (Tatsuya is indeed gifted with huge magic power). \"they shouldn't have casts to begin with\" is wrong,as they didn't create casts for lack of ability but lack of teachers.\\n\r\nAnd there are some more explanation regarding the origin of this casts in light novels.\\n\\n\r\n\"Because equality is evil all of a sudden\" is also explained in novels and is also completely true.Do you think you and I are equal (I don't know who of us is better,but we indeed are never equal)?Do you want to be equal with everyone?\\n\\n\r\n\"A school contest! We literally moved from a terrorist attack to teenagers playing sports.\"\\n\r\nThe attack ended and the enemies were annihilated.What is the problem of that new arc?\\n\\n\r\n\"I understand how that can work much better in text form\"\\n\r\nIndeed,truer than anything!\\n\\n\r\n\"it is bad storytelling, masked with fancy words, appealing to easily satisfied teenagers, which doesn\u2019t translate well when adapted to tv format.\"\\n\r\nThe story is not very good,I agree.Fancy words,however,are very hard to make.Try to write something yourself to see.\" easily satisfied teenagers\" maybe true,however I am one of the people who is satisfied quite hardly.\\n\\n\r\nAnd at last,this is just a work of entertainment.It should not be perfect and it is not.\\n\r\nHowever,those 3/10 and 4/10 are just non-sense,even for the art and sound alone.\\n\r\nAnd I don't deceive you,my true rating for this anime adaptation is 8/10.",

The first arc gotten my interest greatly with some good development that I found in my eyes. However, when it gotten to the second arc, I was confused to see what is really going on anymore. Then when the final arc came in, it gave it's improvement with some average information to me so far.\r\nSound 10/10:\r\nThe sound inthis anime was pretty outstanding for my ears. The explosions and original magic activation was pretty nice. The way how they showed an \"ability\" of Tatsuya's strength with the sound effects was done really nice. So the sound in this anime seem to have some nice originals to it, such as the magic activation, and the explosions.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10:\\n\r\nThe characters in this series was pretty good. Though I wish I had seen more development into those people. Though I did manage to see some development in each arc, but however one of them did not show too much of it. Though the final arc did have some good development that I have found so far, for certain characters at least.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10:\\n\r\nI had my great enjoyment level at at maximum, though after the second arc came in, I did not have much fun as I thought I might be. Maybe this because how rushed it was, and seeing how not much information I wanted was not really shown. There were many questions that I still have but most of them get answered in the end.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 6/10:\\n\r\nAs much as I had my fun times with this series at the beginning, though it had some problems that I found in my own eyes, and ears. This series I will give is a 6/10. However, I did have a great ride with it in between certain episodes.",

            "content": "Having read the novels that this anime is based upon, I can only be let down by this show.\r\nIn terms of art and animation, the show is fairly good. The animation (especially during action or magic sequences) makes it so you can simply forget about the story and background and enjoy the art for a while. Unfortunately, that's about as good as it gets.\r\nI believe the main problem with this show is the poor translation from novel to television. It seems as though the writers wanted to create Tatsuya (the protagonist) into some sort of badass, magic weilding hero who wipes out terrorists and solvesgreat scientific problems in his spare time, all while attending a magical high school. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, all the time spent on action sequences and minor dialogue leaves almost no time for world-building and character background, which in the novel is very critical to the enjoyment of the story. Additionally, it seems that entire chapters (and an entire volume) of the novel are completely ignored or shortened to montages if they focus on any character besides Tatsuya. One of the best parts of the novel is the story about characters other than Tatsuya. This is practically non-existant in the anime, and other characters serve only to provide dialogue for our oh-so-perfect protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nAll of this comes to a very noticeable peak in the \"Yokohama Disturbance\" arc, where (spoilers ahead) we see Tatsuya fully exhibit a jarring lack of emotion when he kills thousands of enemy soldiers in an instant by personally deploying a WMD-grade magic simply because he was ordered to. All the viewer sees is Tatsuya coldly killing people, since the writers somehow decided to leave out an entire volume of the novels in which it is explained that Tatsuya is actually the result of militaristic experimentation, and parts of his mind were forcefully removed via magic. I'm sure you can guess which parts were removed.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei is an novel that probably should have not been made into an anime. If you watched any of this show and felt let down or confused, I'd strongly recommend trying the novels. In the written form you see both better world development and internal dialogue. In the novels, you see Tatsuya become more than a flat and static. He actually has desires, major personality flaws, and a past that can probably explain why he is the way he is. Even more importantly, the novels show the secondary characters as more than just dialogue tools for Tatsuya.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give it a 7/10, because it was fun to watch some scenes I'd read being played out in animation.",

            "content": "***Some parts of this review may kind of give the story away, discretion is advised.***\r\nMahouka Koukou no Rettousei, or The Irregular at Magic High School, is set in a post-World War 3 era, where people can cast magic, implemented with the use of CADs (Casting Assistance Devices). The plot revolves around the life of siblings Tatsuya and Miyuki Shiba, students at the First Magic High School in Japan.\r\nStory (8/10)\r\nI have read the light novels and to be honest, the anime was really well-made. It did cut some corners, but then in my opinion, there isn't much compromise with this adaptation.\r\nOne doesn't have to be nitpickyto see plotholes, for example, how people deal with secrecy in this anime. However, I still gave it an 8 because of how the series explained the principles behind magic. Instead of going the usual route (based on folklore), here they made magic more \"scientific.\" They broke down magic to a more fundamental level (i.e., freezing=slowing down particles, and making blunt objects sharp=resonance), which agrees with physics to some degree.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nI'd say that the fight sequences in this series are well-drawn. However, during other times, the characters' faces seem disproportionate (Miyuki sometimes have this subtle change in the shape of her face).\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nI really liked the scoring and I thin the music fit the scenes well. Upbeat situations are upbeat and funny situations are funny (especially with the Tatsuya x Miyuki scenes, the BGM just cracks me up).\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe series explains the characters' backgrounds well enough, and many people in Mahouka are capable in their own respect. However. HOWEVER. This anime features one of the most overpowered characters in the history of anime: Shiba Tatsuya. It's funny how people in the forums refer to him as \"Jesus,\" and I can't say they're far off the mark.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe thing I enjoyed the most in this series is, like what I explained above, the concept of magic in their universe. I like it when things are explained to me, though some people may not really want to bother with it.\\n\\n\r\nWhether a story is good or enjoyable by having an overpowered main character is always a subject for debate. I enjoyed Mahouka Koukou but to be honest, after watching this, I felt kind of desensitized, seeing the MC blow through every conflict like it was nothing. It's like, all things happened so that the MC can show off his power. It's action porn.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nI would like to recommend this series to everyone who's into science-y stuff, and those who enjoy stories with overpowered characters. I consider watching the exploits of Shiba Tatsuya to be some sort of stress reliever. If you are into anime with good portrayal of conflict and struggle, this one may not be for you.",

But all you need to know from my perspective is that this anime series tried TRIED to push a story that was dreadfully uninteresting toa degree and I never seen before. The only reason it's not a 1 is because I personally feel that maybe there is an interesting story there but since it was so uninteresting I couldn't care less. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation (6/10) Fair\\n\\n\r\nNow since this is by Madhouse it doesn't look bad, but it's nothing outstanding either it's just fair, it's fine. Madhouse probably kept the art style to look exactly how it's manga looks which is why the character designs don't look like a Madhouse character art style design which i don't have an issue with. The animation was also fine nothing amazing was it good? That's debatable it wasn't bad but I think \"Fair\" or \"Fine\" is the best word for it. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10) Good \\n\\n\r\nThe OST for the opening and endings are probably the most enjoyable thing about this series which is sad because you know at the end of the day that really means nothing that's credit to the animation studio that chose that music but I do give credit where credit is due, barely skipped the intro because like I said it was the only time I felt like I was enjoying myself with this series. Sound effects and voice acting all are fine, background music was decent also so overall this section is good.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (2/10) Dreadful  \\n\\n\r\nGeneric Generic Generic Generic is the only word that can be used when describing ever last character in the anime. Obviously one can assume that the manga is probably still ongoing which it is and the characters probably got some sort of character development. And at the end of the anime you can see that they setup series for a possible sequel in the future if it ever got one. But knowing that this is Madhouse that's probably never going to happen and quite frankly I don't think this series deserves a second season. 26 episode in my personal opinion was too much to begin with anyway. In my opinion nothing happen with these 26 episodes felt significant from a story plot or a characterization standpoint. I thought the least I would see is some sort of rivalry between Tatsuya and Ichijou which they were hinting at this entire series and I thought AT LEAST by the end of it we could have at least gotten something... nope nothing.. just dreadful let down and disappointment\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (1/10) Appalling  \\n\\n\r\nThis is why I rarely take something out of my dropped section. This was placed there and honestly it should have stayed there this was so not worth it to any degree. My enjoyment couldn't be any lower it this site aloud negative numbers I probably was have giving this a -3. I dozed off multiple times, I had to do anything to keep myself from turning this boring excuse of an anime off. This has to be the most boring anime I have ever completed.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall (3/10) Poor \\n\r\nMore Specifically (3.60/10) (Who the fuck cares when it's this low but it's here anyway)\\n\\n\r\nLike I stated in my Enjoyment section for this review there are certain things that should stay in your drop list. This is one of them, the only reason I finished this anime is because I made a deal with a friend and if he watched something I really like I'll do the same for him, and unfortunately it was this. Next time if my grudge feel it's not worth it I'm just going to tell him straight up \"No deal bro that anime is not coming out of the drop list\" LOL. But anyway this anime i saw a little potential in around episode like 2 with the training seen with the bald character but nothingness only awaits for you by the time you finish this 26 episode dreadfully generic work of trash called Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei it's a poor I'm sorry I'm going to have to slap my friend in the face for wasting my time with this one. If you are reading this wondering if you should at least give it a chance DON'T.",

            "content": "Hmm... Where to begin with this anime. Well, I'll start with a disclaimer. I marathon-ed this anime over the past day, so I didn't go through the wait of a week per episode as others have, so my opinion on some things will drastically be different for this reason.\r\n---\r\nLet's start with the minor stuff.\r\nArt. The animation was pretty awesome, susuga Madhouse! The character models were quite nice and the uniforms were interestingly done without going too overboard where it was disturbing. Overall, the animation was well done with not too many disappointing moments. 9/10\r\nSound. The music was quite well done. I found the background musicand ost well fit for the scenes, especially the fight scenes. I personally found the electronic/somewhat dubstep quite catchy. Now for the part where the music shines, but fails at the same time. The OPs and EDs for Mahouka, as songs and the animation, were just brilliant. Both OPs, especially \"Rising Hope\" by LiSA, were *very* catchy, and the EDs deserve merit as well. The only problem I had with this was the \"timing\". I feel like most episodes the scene just before the OP or ED just did not match. It was like watching Code Geass R2 OP2. Don't get me wrong, \"World End\" by FLOW is a great song, but I personally didn't find it fitting for the burning world setting of Code Geass at the time. Similarly, there weren't many episodes where I found the OP very \"fitting\" for the current position of the anime itself. In the end, music is a personal preference, so this (along with the rest of this very opinionated review) is all my opinion and are quite subject to bias. By the way, the cast if fucking awesome. This cast was filled with many popular VAs. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter. I'm quite positive that this is where I will come into conflict with others' opinion on the show. Many people are quite unhappy the characters, particularly the SUPER OP main character, due to the lack of background information and our very superficial knowledge on their personality, characteristics, etc. However, putting the fact I'm watching this after Kill la Kill (where the main character is constantly beat down), I personally found the VERY OP main character refreshing. When I went into this anime, I wasn't hoping for anything overly serious, though it may seem that the anime does strive to be one at times. The VERY OP main character really makes the anime relaxed in a sense simply because he can't be beaten. It's like No Game No Life, Blank just doesn't lose. Now the other main problem with the show is the lack of explanation, this happens with everything. Plot, characters, random devices or the magic behind this or that. The characters are just thrown at you with very little development and background information. There was actually a point where I felt like new characters were just thrown at us. (This is most prominent in the last arc.) Don't expect any \"deep\" characters. 7/10 \\n\\n\r\nPlot. Ok, lets start with the pacing. Considering the fact I marathoned it, the pacing would of course feel different for me compared to one who watched while it aired. I found the pacing very interersting yet effective. In my case, the anime was interesting enough to distract me of time and the episode would leave off at the most random of choices. For one, there wasn't a single episode that ended on a really big cliffhanger like in the middle of a battle or anything. However, it was done in a way where you could predict what would happen next which would lead to you wanting to watch more.\\n\r\nAs for the plot itself, it was quite interesting. I was very absorbed in the anime itself through out (I don't typically marathon a 20+ anime). Though it was interesting, it did have its flaws. The plot holes were ALL over the place. There were so many things left unexplained! The first arc did well to try to explain much of what was going on, but as the second and third arc continued, the explanations decreased as action scenes increased. About action scenes, personally, I found them very short. They were short and straight to the point. There was no overly dramatic trade of glances for 5 minutes or anything. The magicians just executed their strategy and that was that. There was a bit of a transition in the last arc. In the last arc in particular, I felt as if the anime started to speed up, which would make sense with how much was left unexplained. The atmosphere also feels much different in the third arc. It's not the type of change that makes the anime drastically worse than what it was, but it definitely felt different. Regardless, to sum it up, the plot was interesting, but much was left unexplained. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment. Well, this one is probably easily the most weighted out of the rest. This anime was one hell of a ride to marathon. I found the first two arcs VERY entertaining. The main problems I had with this anime are the lack of explanation and the ending. The ending wasn't bad (it kind of set up a second season or whatever they want to sequel this with), but it felt very anticlimactic. The main character was just absolutely overpowered with countless trump cards to pull out. There were also a few unresolved problems in the ending, but it can be ignored for now. Again, I watched this after Kill la Kill, so I enjoyed the OP protagonist, but I'm sure many people would find this very very annoying due to the fact his outrageous capabilities take away a great amount of the tension out of the show. It's like watching a Dragon Ball Z movie that doesn't have the part where Goku gets beat up prior to his transformation that would lead to the win. Regardless, this was quite a pleasure to marathon based on my conditions going into the anime (I can't stress Kill la Kill enough...). 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall. Well, this anime was overall quite a nice watch. To sum it up, it's an interesting magic anime with small hints of romance, but it's short comings are lack of explanation and tension (due to main character). The animation and music are well done. The cast is flipping AWESOME! Well, let's just say that I recommend this anime, no promises though. I think this is one of those love it or hate it animes... It seems I fell in the \"love it\" category.\\n\r\n87/100 >> Rounds up to 9/10.",

            "content": "(Sorry if this is kind of a lame review)\r\nThis anime caught my eye for two reasons: watching the first episode was visually pleasing and one of my favorite voice actors was one of the main characters. I guess that was part of the reason I tried super hard to like this one (and believe me, I REALLY wanted to like this anime). Honestly I wish I could explain what this anime was about but after a while, I really didn't know.\r\nStory:\r\nThe story, as stated before, was personally very hard to grasp. I understood that it was (or at least it seemed) set in the futureand technology was extremely advanced and there was this \"magic\" that they used (nothing like the magic in Harry Potter). In the school that the protagonist attends, it's all about magic and you're either really good at it and be enrolled as a Bloom, or you're not so good and end up being enrolled as a Weed (and those who were Weeds were frowned upon and sometimes bullied by the Blooms). It's basically a day in a life anime where you see the main character, Tatsuya and his little sister Miyuki enroll in this school which is the main setting. Also Miyuki has romantic feelings for her brother which I found pretty weird because she makes it kind of obvious but it's kind of unclear whether or not Tatsuya knows and goes along with it or really is oblivious about his sisters feelings. The entire story (whatever it was supposed to be) just really didn't stick with me which is why I ultimately ended up dropping it after the 20th episode. Anyways the entire story I gave a 4/10\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nI thought the art was VERY VERY VERYYY good, especially when they were performing magic. I always got excited when they would start using it, even if it was for a class, because everything was just fantastic! There really were no flaws about this, so I gave it a 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was pretty good, and got very intense around the times Tatsuya was performing his magic against someone else (so fighting, dont know why I just didnt say that before). I gave it a 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe character development............ sucked. In fact, there really was none, it was that poorly done. I know I've only watched 20 episodes a while ago but the one thing that stuck with me was that there was no development. Plus I really don't know why Tatsuya was placed as a Weed when he was EXTREMELY good at magic. I honestly have no clue if they ended up getting to that or if I missed something in the episodes that I've watched but that part really got me thinking if A: he was being modest or B: that school had super high standards but even if that was the case, he was better than a lot of the other students. Plus he kicked major ass while fighting. From the episodes I've watched, the younger sister Miyuki really didn't do any magic but when she did, I'll admit, it was pretty damn cool. She was practically a futuristic Elsa and in fact, her magic kind of got out of control when in an emotional state, like Elsa. She's pretty, kind although a bit odd in having romantic feelings for her brother. The supporting characters were nice people and all and filled the comedy relief factor but other than that, there really was no development for them at all. I gave this a 3/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nAs I said before, after a while the show kinda just got... lame. Boring even. The beginning was pretty interesting and it did get me hooked for as long as it did but after about the 12th or 13th episode, I was always questioning whether or not I should give this anime the benefit of doubt and hope it would get better or if I should just drop it. Obviously I ended up dropping it after a while. What I really enjoyed about this anime was the magic and I enjoyed watching Tatsuya fight a bunch of jerks that thought they were \"the shit\" when they looked weak and pathetic fighting against Tatsuya. I gave this a 5/10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nOverall I gave it a 4/10, and I truly wish I could give it a higher score but I just didn't like it. It had so much potential, especially given the amount of episodes it has out but in the end I was very disappointed.",

Joe goes undercover with his X-Man sister (whom he has almost an incestuous relationship with) at Number one Harry Potter school in 2090s post-war neo-feudal Japan, while battling the Chinese military and an array of mafia gangsters in his spare time. Sounds like it's got something going for it yeah? And yet somehow it gets bogged down in explaining high tech magic techniques and gadgetry like how one on one Shonen series battles get bogged down with opponents explaining their fighting technique to each other to the power of ten. What could be an amazing thing is dourand boring three quarters of the time and I feel sympathy or affinity with absolutely none of the characters. \\n\r\n On the plus side, the nationalistic and bald faced anti-Chinese propaganda is amusing as hell. The writers totally give their commie neighbours across the pond a big middle finger. It will be interesting to see how an American dub handles this matter. A second series is teased so we will probably get it whether we want it or not. The anime seems to have elicited strong opinions of loathing and fanboydom, I'm left shrugging my shoulders and wondering if I can order a decent CAD off Tor.",

            "content": "Hi guys!~ This is my first ever review ^^ I found this anime via Crunchyroll and it's pretty good. With a fast paced story, great characters and beautiful sound effects, it's worth watching!~\r\nStory: 8 \r\nSince the synopsis has been given, I'll just quickly do a run through. Even though it seems like it's just about school kids learning magic, it is so much more than that. Through Tatsuya, we can see so much of how magic can corrupt people and how it can change everyone's lives. The story was very well developed and I was impressed with the idea that magic can be scientific. Ifyou don't understand any principles, the show did a mini series that explained all the theories and systems in 2095. Just search up in the Funimation channel on YouTube. The story was also very unpredictable, which made it very exciting and tense. Another interesting thing was one of Tatsuya's friends and classmates uses Ancient Magic, as opposed to Modern Magic. It was very enjoyable to see the old and new world mix together. Even though there's so much more, I felt the story was very satisfying. Additionally, this anime proved that not all animes need a pervert or a sexual joke at every turn.  \\n\r\nArt: 8 \\n\r\nThe art was very nice. The scenery was gorgeous especially on the First High School Campus during the spring. The sakura tree scenes made me wish I was in Japan. \\n\r\nSound/Music: 10 \\n\r\nThe sound effects were great. They sounded really realistic. The ops and endings are quite nice too. The first one, Rising Hope by LiSA, is one of my all time favorites.\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nAlthough the story was good, the character development was a bit trippy. I'll give you this example. In the first episode, we see a flashback where we see Miyuki seemingly scared and Tatsuya seemingly protecting her. I wish the anime further explored what happened that day. In the light novels, which I read a bit, they do explain and this event is very crucial to character development for the Shiba siblings and explaining why Tatsuya and Miyuki are so attached to each other. There's so much in Mahouka to explore and help further develop the characters. I was a bit upset when the anime ended and not much of Tatsuya's past was revealed. He is a character that has so many features worthy of development. If only the anime had more episodes...\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9\\n\r\nI loved the story, which always brought suprises and action in every episode, but, as I said before, I was a little disappointed with character development. \\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nThis anime was a roller coaster ride and I'm glad I watched it. It's really worth watching~",

Okay, not SnK level, but who doesn't want a badass MC who 1) isn't phased by clingy girls (except for maybe his sister), 2) has amazing, HIDDEN talent, 3) has a mysterious backstory, and 4) comes out well in terms of art?\r\nAlthough Miyuki, the MC's sister is slightly annoying with \"onii-chan, onii-chan\" all the time, at least she's not a weak or stupid female who needs to be protected all the time. She's pretty powerful too. \r\nThrow in magic and school life, and MKnR really comes to life!\r\nI'm sure that almost allthe female characters fall in love with the MC at some point but it's not harem or anything. \\n\\n\r\nI think the only unsatisfying thing is the ending - the way they left it on a cliffhanger at the end teases us with the possibility of a 2nd season, but who knows if/when that's gonna happen? There's definitely more to the story cause there are still a few questions left unanswered at the end of the series -- I guess I'll have to read the LN to find out.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, I've never read the LN and the manga hasnt been translated fully, but I really enjoyed this series and rated it an 8 overall. This series shouldn't be avoided because of previous low ratings, or you're really missing out on an interesting series.",

I personally lover the art style in the anime and it was beautifully optimized with a great show of color with perfect balance for the theme of action.  The Symbols were clear and the View Direction at times was Jaw dropping. The story has some major inconsistency Issues. There are a lot of plot holes as far as i could I find. The story has a invincible person. Which Just takes out the fun in watching it. The Development even if he is a strongcharacter is seriously suffering. With zero to no development with almost god-like knowledge is almost a waste of time watching it. the sounds were Good to Bad in my opinion and were not used in sync with the story. Overall it was very mediocre, good if you consider the art style of the anime to be main aspect of judging. \\n\r\n~Xavier Frost. Freezing Ice itself.",

Now for me Tastsuya was so nonsensically  OP that it was like watching mike tyson punch the shit out of some babies then explain why he punched said babies and win a nobel peace prize for punching said babies then none of his friendsfigure out that hes OP or even question it. Now the MC in Irregular was not just overpowered physically he was also overpowered mentally and it was hilarious that none of his friends ever caught on when it was in front of them,it reminded me of Dora where I always  wonder how can some one be so oblivious.

            "content": "And so ends Mahouka. This Anime is undoubtedly exactly for you, or not at all. All of what's written below is spoiler-free, and a bit long. Without wasting any more words, i'll start by stating the 3 main reasons for the somewhat large dislike of this Anime.\r\nOne of the problems with Mahouka and it getting average ratings is that it realistically lacked in the action department. The Light Novel is actually incredibly hard to properly animate, it has alot of terminology and alot of explanations. The info dumps we were getting in Mahouka are still nothing compared to the real thing. Despite that, it stillfelt monotone, so most people simply got sick of it. I, however, admire the attempt of sticking to the original story at the expense of action.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's the protagonist, without a question one of the most important elements of any Anime. Typical \"love or hate\" character, Tatsuya is extremely strong, extremely smart, good looking, popular with the girls, kind yet ruthless, humble yet confident - in short, he is almost flawless. Fortunately for me, he is just what i like watching, but many still prefer the established \"forever weak, but strong-willed\", or \"gradually-improving\" type of MCs. I admit, it's pretty hard to get excited about a new villain when you know what Tatsuya is capable of, but, again, i find joy in that. \\n\\n\r\nThen there's the other main character - Miyuki. If you still like Mahouka despite the aforementioned \"flaws\", this is the final challenge. The brocon characters have long existed in Anime, so here's another one - light-yandere type. As her profile page says, Miyuki Shiba has feelings stronger than sibling love for Tatsuya, and this is made apparent in every episode, specifically by the (over)use of honorifics, blushing, the usual Japanese anime drill. Once again, this is not a problem for me (she is nothing compared to the abomination that is Kirino Kousaka), in fact, i thought she was cute, especially considering hers and Tatsuya's past, which isn't covered in the Anime, regrettably.\\n\\n\r\nThese are the 3 factors that tipped the scales against Mahouka in terms of rating, at least on this site. Now that that's out of the way, what follows is my honest rating of this show.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10. The story is vivid, large-scale political-warfare type, mixing magic and science. It is portrayed incredibly well in the LN, but, for one reason or another, it was somewhat hard to get into it with the Anime, not much of the actual story was revealed, and many things were hinted at, but never explored.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7.5/10. The characters are well done, consisting of both cliches and relatively new and interesting ones. A big issue is that everyone besides the two main characters has their screentime drastically lessened in the Anime, and because of that they feel like too much of fence-sitters, making it hard to build a connection.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10. Not much to say here, the art is simply very appealing, as expected of Madhouse. \\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack: 8.5/10. Mahouka's soundtrack is very good, whether you like the techno-type or not. Both openings and endings are pleasant. The fact that i even remember it speaks for itself, since there are many animes with pretty much bland, forgetful soundtracks.\\n\\n\r\nThis brings my final score to an 8/10. Mahouka is a good attempt at an adaptation of a very good light novel, and if you have patience and a soft spot for strong main characters, you will undoubtedly come to enjoy it.",

            "content": "So, a ton of people have complained about the main character, Tatsuya Shiba, being way too overpowered for the show. This is undoubtedly true, but, in my experience, it didn't take away from the enjoyment at all. If you are the kind of person who, for some obscure reason, wants to see an MC grow slowly and then become slightly cooler than they were before, then you might not want to watch this anime. But if you love badass scenes, great animation, and a solid plot, then you definitely should. Of course, it's not as if the MC just uses all of his power tojust rampage through everything; instead, he slowly reveals each of his powers one at a time and *then* rampages through everything. But, all joking aside, the MC's background is really interesting, and his \"OPness\" comes at a pretty significant cost, so it's kind of justified. He still faces somewhat serious conflict, and while otherwise dangerous situations may feel somewhat less harrowing due to his immense power, there are a few of them that left me in suspense. Plus, there are quite a few other characters that are involved in the action, so you can't forget about them.  And also, once again, I must stress this: the MC is utterly BADASS. It's just plain fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nEssentially, watch this if you don't mind a very OP main character and are more interested in the action sequences or the immersive plot. Or pretty much anything aside from the fact that Tatsuya is an OP main character.",

And I think does it always have to be a weak guy gets strong. Can't we have a guy who is strong from the get go who doesn't need to struggle against every two bit bad guy that he comes across?  Well one of the answers to that is \"Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei\". The main malelead Shiba, Tatsuya is an unstoppable unfeeling killing machine, and his sister is not to shabby herself in the fighting (or cute looks) department.\\n\\n\r\nNow I didn't give it a 10 out of 10 for although I love this anime its not what I would call a masterpiece. Its still a High School Magic school anime, although not as fluffy or kiddy as most. And how the magic works was explained but not very well, not that I was really following it very closely but it was too much fake science and half explained notions for me and would have been better if they would have just left it out in my opinion. Also the very strong brother/sister complex may turn some people off though it didn't bother me any.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum it up if you like the concept of a strong male character that as soon as he steps on the screen starts taking out his enemy's without having to go through episode after episode of watching him getting completely owned then this show is for you!",

            "content": "[May contain minor spoilers. Sorry if my english is bad.]\r\nAs what i read from others reviews, Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei is getting hated by people. But let's say this straight. The show was really not that bad and personally was a good one for me.\r\nStory : 8/10\r\nThe story was set somewhen in 22nd century, when Magic concept had been recognized as formal Technology and mainly used for military purposes. Every country competed each other to get and train strong magic users. As of this there was Magic Highschool. Place where students studied magic and were trained to be magic masters. The season was spring. Thebrother and sister Shiba Tatsuya and Shiba Miyuki enrolled as new students in first Magic Highschool.\\n\\n\r\nI personally found the story unique and interesting, and i really like it. One i don't like from this anime is the characters conversations. Everytime they talked about magic things, the conversations were really hard to understand. Since they told unfamilliar words, things, and terms. But as i went through, i was finally able to understand those quietly. But others than that were decent and great. The sci-fi plot, concepts, e.g. If you are a sci-fi fan, maybe you'll enjoy the story pretty much.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters : 7/10\\n\r\nOne of the most interesting point in this anime was the main character. Shiba Tatsuya, who was exremely overpowered. Some people complain and hate the OP Shiba. I don't know why people hate him. I think Tatsuya is a really interesting character. And i'm always happy and really excited to see Tatsuya became 'badass'. It was really fun to see him so overpowered. So far it's one of my favorite character. Aside from that, i didn't like his 'sister-complex' trait to his sister, Miyuki. The same thing goes with Miyuki. And then Shiba Miyuki. I actually was pretty annoyed by her, really. I just it everytime Miyuki become spoiled to his brother.I thought it was really weird. For the supporting characters for me they were good and really interesting.\\n\\n\r\nArt : 8/10\\n\r\nThe art was beautiful, tho. The sceneries, backgrounds, etc. It was really nice. And also for the magic powers art, i thougt it was really cool.\\n\\n\r\nSound : 9/10\\n\r\nFor me, Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei was one of the anime which had really great Opening-Ending combo. Both openings, grilleto and Rising Hope, were great and both are my favorites. The endings were also really good. The soundtracks were also pretty cool. It had modern and some dubstep soundtracks on it, which fitted perfectly with the sci-fi and modern plot.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 9/10\\n\r\nYes,it was pretty enjoyable to me, no doubt.\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 8/10\\n\r\nOverall it was a really great one and so far one of my favorite anime. People may dislike it, but i don't really care coz i really loved the show. Well, this review is based on what i thought. You may like the show or hate it. If you want to find some good-interesting sci-fi anime, then you should give Mahouka Koukou no rettousei a try.\\n",

            "content": "I wrote a review for this show a while ago, somewhere along the 12 episode mark and so it was deleted upon the release of the last episode, but I figured rather then just letting it sit on my computer, I'd just post it back up if anyone was interested. While some of the points in it are no longer relevant, it does contain some backstory that some people might find interesting/enjoyable. So just keep in mind that this is NOT a review of the completed series and please enjoy.\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nThe purpose of this review is primarily to address the points raised in previous reviews aboutthis anime. If you're looking for an accurate evaluation of the show, I'd suggest watching a little yourself or holding off until more episodes are released and the story develops further. Hopefully, this review will make the anime more enjoyable for you, or atleast clear up some questions. I'll try my best to avoid any spoilers, but in case I let anything slip, I apologize in advance.\\n\\n\r\nLet me first state that I believe a review should reflect upon the entire show, not just the first half of it. For many anime, it is common for the first half to be slow and ease the audience into familiarity of a new world, yet all of the reviews so far are based solely upon the first 9 of 26 episodes. I strongly recommend that you stick with the show atleast up to the end of the 9 Schools Competition arc, where you'll be able to make a more holistic judgment about the anime. At the very least, I wanted to provide a counter balance to the other reviews in order to not mislead potential viewers. With that said, let's begin!\\n\\n\r\nI'll start with a quick introduction of the show: \\n\r\nMahouka Koukou no Rettousei is based in a world where magic has only recently become more accessible through the invention of the Casting Assistance Device (CAD), but even so, the number of individuals capable of using magic are still in the minority. While the benefits of magic have just barely been explored, the potential of magic in domestic and global, especially military, affairs has the entire world scrambling to establish domination over this new resource. It is in this discordant situation that we find our main characters, a pair of siblings enrolling in their first year at the prestigious magic high school, First High School. However, even in an environment filled exclusively with fellow magicians, the siblings cannot escape the conflicts inherent in magic. Of the 200 students admitted into First High, only 100 with greater magical talent are selected to receive personal instruction (Course One or \"Blooms\"), while the other half shares the same curriculum, but instead receives their education solely from digital sources (Course Two or \"Weeds\"). Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei follows Tatsuya and Miyuki Shiba as they face the discrimination, abuse, greed, and jealousy that their status as magicians entails.\\n\\n\r\nSo, one of the biggest qualms people seem to have with this series is the fact that the Tatsuya is essentially the most powerful character of the entire cast and, to be honest, I completely agree. Tatsuya's status as a Course Two student suggests that his magical talent is inferior to that of Course One students, yet as the story progresses, we quickly see that this is far from the truth. In fact, Tatsuya's mastery of martial arts and magical theory and engineering elevate his combat ability beyond that of any character, allowing him to easily overcome any and every obstacle he faces. And thus rises the protest: \"Why, this is just wish fulfillment! The 'weak, unappreciated guy' turns out to be some overpowered, unbeatable hero and becomes popular with everyone!\" \\n\\n\r\nHowever, if you look closely, Tatsuya is far from that ideal, likable protagonist that you might think he is. Consider the following: Tatsuya isn't an attention seeker, doesn't seem to particularly enjoy life at First High and is a major target for bullies who are jealous of him. With his combat abilities and magical knowledge, he could easily find a position in society that would acknowledge his talents, yet he still choses to attend school. What possible incentive could he have for choosing to remain in such a place? (I'll cover this more later)\\n\\n\r\nAnother problem arising from Tatsuya's unmatched abilities is that he dispels any sense of danger or crisis from the predicaments he faces. While this is true for the first few episodes, the scale of the opposition he faces can only grow, so give it some time to develop and you'll be rewarded with more interesting situations and action. After all, a story with absolutely no major conflict couldn't possibly have become so popular.\\n\\n\r\nSome question the decision to use a school setting for this story, and perhaps, on a superficial level, the bright and slightly childish environment of a school seems to ruin the dark themes of the anime. But as we'll soon see, a magical high school is anything but a safe haven to develop a young magician's abilities. In fact, the shocking difference between our expectations and reality contributes greatly to the idea that there is a appalling lack of protection for these maturing magicians, who could decide the future of the nation and even the fate of the world.\\n\\n\r\nThe high school setting also gives us insight into the status of the magical community. As stated previously, the only real difference between the Course One and Course Two students is the presence of a magic instructor. The limited number of educators reflects the relatively recent expansion of the magic community, which can be likened to a third world country, but armed with enough power to change the world. In such a situation, it's only to be expected that outside powers would fight for exploitation of such an opportunity while others would fear its potential and plot its annihilation. Such is the daily environment that our characters find themselves in as they struggle to avoid succumbing to a variety of plots ranging from those of terrorists to governments, of classmates to family members.\\n\\n\r\nThe class differentiation between Course One and Two leads to a multitude of major problems in the show. While all 200 students have proven themselves through their enrollment to First High, the talent and effort of Course One students have been acknowledged to be above the that of Course Two students, as designated by the flower symbol on their uniforms that Course Two students lack. Driven by their families to become the strongest magicians, yet living in a world where the majority of the population is unaffiliated with magic, the only sense of security for these young magicians lies in their superiority over their Course Two peers. However, having already proven their ability, some Course Two students have the potential of overtaking Course One students and replacing them through hard work, and thus Course One students resort to using derogatory terms like \"Weeds\" to both flaunt their status of \"Blooms\" while discouraging Course Two students from attempting to work their way up to Course One.\\n\\n\r\nThe Course Two perspective is much more complicated, as they are caught between two conflicting ways of thinking. Having once been the cream of the crop, after entering First High, one of the most prestigious magic schools in Japan, these young magicians find themselves at the bottom of the pecking order, looked down upon by peers of superior heritage, talent, performance or even all three. On one hand, these youths are tempted by the anti-magic calls for \"equality\", which is to eliminate magic from all evaluation processes, but essentially ignores all the work that magicians put into honing their magical prowess. On the other hand, all Course Two students have already been acknowledged to hold substantial magical ability through their acceptance into First High. As such, it's only natural that they too would be proud of their magical talents and therefore would be loathe to simply surrender a major part of who they are. Then, the only choice left would simply be to work hard to earn a spot in Course One. But how does hard work hold up in the face of pure talent, or the lack thereof? Against peers with seemingly monstrous magical power and the fact that effort can only take one so far, it's unsurprising for some students to completely lose hope.\\n\\n\r\nNow enter Tatsuya, a high school freshman labeled as a magically inferior Course Two student, yet whose unrivaled combat abilities allow him to challenge even the most powerful Course One students. The appearance of such an irregular existence has the entire school beginning to question the class system that has been such an intregal part of the school, as well as the Course One students' egos. In the presence of such a misfit, it is inevitable that people would start to raise questions, some of which can be applied to our own societies and lives. How are people and their abilities evaluated? To what extent are we able to appreciate a person as a whole through our current standards? Perhaps what we see as important today really came from insignificant roots.\\n\\n\r\nIndeed, these are legitimate questions in their own right, but the story lies beyond them and focuses more upon Tatsuya himself. For what reason would someone who clearly understands that he would be undervalued choose to enter such a place? He's hardly the hopeless idealist that would take the time to prove society wrong and he would be much more appreciated had he chosen to attend a school with less of a focus on magical ability. And while we're at it, why has Tatsuya invested so heavily in the martial arts? He hardly seems to care about being combatively superior to his peers and practicing the martial arts doesn't seem to be his passion. In fact, Tatsuya barely seems to have any passions and nearly never shows any sort of emotion at all.\\n\\n\r\nNow, let's talk about our other main character, Miyuki. Miyuki is what would widely be described as \"perfect\": beautiful, extremely talented, well mannered and intelligent. With Miyuki as the little sister to the plain and less talented Tatsuya, one would naturally expect for there to be some tension in their relationship. What's more is that despite Tatsuya being nearly a year older, both siblings are enrolled in the same grade, with the younger sister ranked as #1 of the entire class while the older brother is just barely accepted into the school.\\n\\n\r\nEven so, Miyuki respects Tatsuya to the point worship. Perhaps in some other shows, there would be no explanation for their relationship, or it'd be a simple and lame \"Oh, he's nice\" excuse. But in Mahouka, the commonplace relationship between older brother and younger sister is completely skewed by the magic world and in order to fully comprehend how it came to be this way, you'd have to understand the dark secrets behind magic families and the public perception of magicians, which may or may not be revealed later in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum it all up, ladies and gentlemen, the anime is not even halfway through yet! Things have only just begun to get interesting! I believe that Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei has not yet had the chance to develop its main themes that made it so popular and if you choose to give it the time, it will undoubtably prove itself to be a remarkable anime. Thanks for taking the time to read this and I hope you found it worthwhile! Any feedback is greatly appreciated from both \"helpful\" and \"not helpful\"s alike!",

Read on.\r\nThe first feeling that may dissuade you from the show is apparent at the start of the first episode: \"Onii-chan\", you will hear that line about an average 6.6 times per episode. I say \"may dissuade\" because this imperfect world is filled with silly things like: \"Opinions\"and \"facts\" to me they're different sides of the same coin, instead of sharing my philosophical view with you, I shall proceed with the review: The protagonists' sister has a massive brother complex and the show itself is self-aware of it, some view it as a side-joke, some view it as a turn on and some will be turned off.\\n\\n\r\nIt's ever present through out the show so whether you either ignore it, embrace it, power through it or just out-right drop it after the 3 episode rule is up to you, but this isn't kiss x sis or monogatari. that's not the reason why this show has a mean score of 7, maybe it is but that's not the point.\\n\\n\r\nThis show has a character nick-named magic-Jesus by it's fans. A common complain is that the character to Overpowered (OP), I ask you, as oppose to solving everything with friendship and hard-earned training?\\n\\n\r\nThis show, this show is what happens when James Bond has magic powers and goes to a Japanese high school. Do you watch James Bond for the deep plot? Do you watch James Bond for him to go through character development?  Do you watch James Bond so he can defeat his enemies with friendship and pure willpower?\\n\\n\r\nHell no.\\n\\n\r\nYou watch James Bond because he's a mother-fucking badass that sweeps all the ladies and make his enemies cry.\\n\\n\r\nThis is Magic Jesus James Bond: The Anime.\\n\\n\r\nStory? Just another word for \"more reasons why Tatsuya is the most badass character ever    conceived\" \\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound? It's by Mad House, nothing can go too wrong.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: A loose anime adaptation of the book: \"The life and times of Magic Jesus Bond\"\\n\\n\r\n007/10 would Onii-Chan again.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I so much wanted to write a Mahouka No Rettousei review for various reasons, mainly positive \r\nStory 8:The anime centers to the life of two siblings Miyuki and Tatsuya Shiba while being in a prestigous magic school.The girl has a natural charisma while the boy mainly uses his brain and knoweledge to close this gap.The plot also has subrootes and thats 1 him being an undercover and moreover (2) Shiba's status in Tatsuya family.\r\nAt this point i would like to comment on the mechanics and characteristics of the magic spells implemented in the anime, they are versatile huge in number and very complicated which personallygave me a great impression since the start of the anime, with other words its quite deep.They dont just throw a fireball or an iceball.There is a ridicously wide range of spells, that can be activated with a very interesting way, Ono Manabu has obviously worked a lot on this.Its not easy to build a magic world and try to adjust/enhance those spells (through an engineer character) and most important to make it beleivable to the audience\\n\\n\r\nArt 9: Outstanding art, from the costumes, the spells through various of items, the battle between students are quite enjoyable and so fun to watch and art plays a major role to that\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound 10 : What can i say its almost perfect the music during the battles catchy and succesfull, the sound effects of various spells are close to perfect , simply amazing\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7: There is so much arguement about Shiba Tatsuya which i really dont understand i disagree with the majority of them, to be specific. Tatsuya is an amazing character he is not the super talent in magic nevertheless he is quite incompetent, he varies from the other MCs with the ridicoulus powers, try hard/shout mentality that after a while he becomes the ''one'' the chosen the superhero.Not even close, actually Tatsuya starts as a Weed*and remains) he is very humble(something i like) modest and straightforward(think i like very much since most of MCs today are cupcakes who never express themselves), and with his efforts he starts to rise in peoples prestige level.\\n\r\nLets not forget that Tatsuya is considered a magic mind brilliance ,and not because he borned like that but because he owns facilities and he propably has studied a lot. He is one of the rare occations that i dont mind getting all this female attention,and thats because he deserves it, whereas in other animes nowdays MC gets all the attention for simply no reason. I have to agree though that as far as the other characters are concerned , stories are kinda swallow yet but the characters are lovable! The female MC is indeed a bit one sided ,\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8.5: I personally liked a few anime the spring season but Mahouka is sincerly the only anime that kept me excited(and still does) in all its episodes with no exception,The anime has many MANY ''wow' moments and that says a lot\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8: Overall i would normally give it a 8.5 but characters are a main part of every anime so i will give it an 8. I recomment this anime to everyone its great and it will keep u excited all the time.Tatsuya is one of the best characters i've seen , and Mahouka No Rettousei its the most perfect made and well worked example of How world would be if we all had a little bit of magic inside us!",

While many people think that Shiba Tatsuya is over powering I don't really think that's the case. He looks to be strong and really smart among the students of First High but when it comes to members of the ten master clans he's not all that strong. People like Jumonji, Saegusa, and even Erika seemed to be on par in terms of strength with Shiba. None of them really showed their true power in the first season for Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei but you candefinitely tell that they have their own strong abilities and trump cards. Shiba has his own weaknesses and strengths as well. While he's an genius with magical engineering, his practical magic side is terrible even in as a course 2. The only real over powering strength would be his healing magic \"Regrowth\" but that's the only over powering ability he has and from what I watched and heard, it seems that Shiba's true enemy is his aunt, the head of the Yotsuba clan and she most likely has the means the suppress his Regrowth Magic since she was the one who genetically modified him.",

            "content": "Here goes my first review. There may be a spoiler or two in here. Sorry.\r\nA while ago, an irl friend told me to watch Mahouka when I asked him what I should watch next. I found that it was on Netflix, so I watched it. I went about eight episodes in. I felt I wasn't going to like this around the fifth episode. After the eighth, I put Mahouka on hold. A few weeks had passed, and I considered dropping Mahouka, but my friend asked me how far I'd gotten into it. When I said I was eight episodes in and I had stopped, hetold me to keep going. So I did. I finished Mahouka about four to six months later. Very slowly, watching the show one episode every week or two. I really didn't enjoy it, but I give a damn about my friend, so I finished it for his sake.\\n\\n\r\nTatsuya was a massively overpowered character who never lost. One-shotting named characters, annihilating all the mooks in seconds, always smarter than every other character, and every time someone is doing a voiceover claiming that something is possible, he manages to do it. It happens so often it's predictable. Don't get me started on how thick his plot armor was. I know he was the main character, but oh boy, he brought himself back to life. How? Magic. Phlebotinum at its finest. He was a bigger male Mary Sue than Kirito from SAO was. He never lost, and it made his character boring.\\n\\n\r\nDon't get me started on how thirsty Miyuki was on Tatsuya's ass. I know brother-sister incest is a common thing in anime, but this case managed to annoy me the most. If you were to take a shot every time she flirted with her brother, you would be dead before the end of the first arc. It bothered me so much that I had the urge to break something every time I heard those words. Those haunting, god damn words...\\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\n\"Onii-sama!\"\\n\\n\r\n80% of the episodes include, in chronological order:\\n\r\nMiyuki praising her brother while flirting with him.\\n\r\nSomeone claiming Tatsuya isn't all that great.\\n\r\nMiyuki angrily replying to said person.\\n\r\nTatsuya declaring he will defend his sister's honor through a battle/duel.\\n\r\nTatsuya humiliating said person through a one-sided fight.\\n\r\nRepeat.\\n\\n\r\nOne final thing.\\n\r\nA lot of magic terms were made up in Mahouka. I didn't know what the hell they were, so a character in Mahouka would explain what it was.\\n\r\nAfter the explanation, I still didn't understand it. Confusing as hell, man.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: Overpowered protagonist. Annoying amount of incest subtext. Predictable progression of events. Confusing technological mumbo-jumbo.\\n\\n\r\n5/10.",

            "content": "This anime is a bit controversial especially when it comes to its characters. I have seen most people give it bad reviews although I believe it deserves better. \r\nTL;DR: I enjoyed the anime and I think the characters are in some way unique.\r\nStory: 5\r\nThe world setting is interesting and tries to be more mature than the other anime about magic.\r\nThe story itself is broken into arcs. I liked its pacing since it was fast enough not to make me bored but slow enough to engage me into it. The story is well told but a bit rushed nearing the end. I particularly liked that mostof story elements were very logical with the except of couple last episodes which spoiled all the fun. I would put 8 for the story if they did not do that.\\n\r\nI also have to say that I felt like the anime needed more time to show everything in order to enrich enjoyment of watchers. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nThe art is great. I mean really great. Everything feels like in place for the world setting. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nThe sound is amazing. It complements the story and probably one of the best I have ever seen in anime. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\r\nI would say this is the most controversial point in this anime. \\n\r\nThere is a lot of people who hate the way Tatsuya is overpowered and what he does. This is something you either like or hate. Not much to say here. \\n\r\nWhat I would like to point out is the way characters behave and live through the story. This is a strong point of this anime. Most of the characters who get enough screen time feel very natural and realistic. They are given some set of characteristics and they go through the story logically according to their personalities.\\n\r\nI find the siblings really great.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nI really enjoyed Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei. Although it could have been better.\\n\r\nI felt like the anime should have been longer to really develop the story. \\n\r\nThe story is unfortunately the weakest point of it. As I said the anime was ruined by 2-3 last episodes. These episodes just took away all the realistic approach to the whole series.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMore details on characters and why I liked them. Might contain SPOILERS but I will try to avoid them:\\n\\n\r\nI would say I have liked all the characters maybe with the exception of school psychologist. \\n\r\nThere can be written a lot about every character but I will write only about main cast. I have to say that probably what I saw in Shiba siblings is what I wanted to see or how I interpreted it.\\n\\n\r\nBoth Shiba siblings are victims of their family. I would really like to see the continuation of these series to get more details of what and how it happened.\\n\\n\r\nTatsuya:\\n\r\nThe way he is fond of his sister is very interesting and at the moment of writing I cannot recall any other character who was similar to him in this way. The love (well, if you can call it so) to Miyuki is probably the only emotions set he feels and it is interesting to see to what it might lead when a human is only capable of one emotions set. \\n\r\nI would say that Tatsuya is generally a good person. This is another interesting point of his character when you see someone good but emotionless. \\n\r\nSome have said that he is like Mike Tyson who beats children in kindergarden with a smile but I would rather say that he is like an adult who, because of certain circumstances, must protect a child in kindergarden. He does not enjoy this superior position. He does not like to beat other students in order to protect his sister or her wishes. He seems to do not like to be in the school but he loves Miyuki and will do anything to please her.\\n\\n\r\nMiyuki:\\n\r\nWell behaved on public (mostly) but in a charming way spoiled and a bit wicked girl when it comes to her brother. I find her very cute and realistic female character. Her love to her brother sometimes goes on the edge of sanity.",

            "content": "Let me make this clear before I begin: I rate things with a very heavy weighting towards enjoyment. This is why I rated Mahouka a 10 overall, despite it's only decent characters and storyline. With that said, this anime is definitely not for everyone.\r\nI honestly have trouble seeing what the disconnect is between Mahouka's reviews (an average of roughly a strong 3) and it's ratings (a solid 7.5ish). Either some people are too critical, or far too many people don't appreciate the time, effort, and dedication that goes into building a world as complex and detailed as this one.\r\nStory - 7\r\nMahouka's story is fairly generic,but well done overall. Typical high school setting, nearly deteriorating into a harem anime at some points, but somehow Madhouse managed to make the issues feel a lot more important than most similar shows can pull off. Be prepared, though, for exposition. Lots of it. This show will have a 2 minute fight, then spend 10 minutes explaining what happened, over and over again. If you don't mind trawling through an hour's worth of information condensed into a few minutes on a regular basis, though, there's plenty of interesting nuances that really make the world come to life.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10\\n\r\nMahouka is an absolutely beautiful show. The character designs are a bit more subtle than most shows, giving it a better sense of realism. There are only a couple mild cases of protagonist hair, and even those wouldn't be impossible naturally. The animation is smooth and fluid, especially during fight scenes, drawing you into the action like few shows can. Even the environments are well done, fitting the show's atmosphere to a T and never getting out of sync with the characters or action going on in front of it.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8\\n\r\nTwo good but not great OPs, one awesome and one decent ending, and great SFX and voice acting the entire way through. Could be better, but not by a ton.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters -  6\\n\r\nFairly generic and OP, but not altogether bad. A ridiculously overpowered protagonist, a borderline incestuous sister, and an entourage of supporting characters with good personalities but minimal backstory comprise most of the cast. However, unlike many shows that fall along the same lines, there is not a single named character in the show that's useless. Not. One. Every character is shown at some point doing something completely, unbelievably, incredibly badass, and every character serves their purpose in a big way over the course of the show, with not a single one falling by the wayside in unfulfilled anonymity. The show gives the sense that, without the godlike protagonist stealing the show, the characters would still find some way to win, even if it was one on 1000.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now for a couple categories that you don't really see much, because I don't think reviewing Mahouka without them would be fair.\\n\\n\r\nWorldbuilding - 10\\n\r\nGood world building, in my opinion, always falls at either end of a spectrum. There are vast, expansive worlds like Star Wars or Lord of the Rings that give the sense that there is truly no end to the possibilities of the world, and there are smaller worlds like Harry Potter that are fleshed out down to the last tiny detail. Mahouka falls firmly under the latter. A dedicated viewer can take the huge, dense amount of information that the show throws at you and tear it apart piece by piece to uncover the very foundations of Mahouka's world, and not a crack is left unfilled. The sheer detail with which the world is constructed gives it an immense sense of realism, especially for science fiction - you get the feeling that, while there is certainly more to be discovered, the rules of the world have been well defined to the point it becomes almost real.\\n\\n\r\nMagic System - 10\\n\r\nThere is no getting around the fact that Mahouka is a magic anime, even with it's tech elements. Personally, there is not much I love more than a well-done magic system, and Mahouka fits the bill perfectly. Far too many stories make magic this arcane, incomprehensible thing with only the barest of rules if any (looking at you, Fairy Tail). Mahouka does not. It's magic system is not only unique and innovative in it's technological ties, but is thought out and defined down to the last tiny little detail, much as the world itself is. You will not find characters in Mahouka breaking the rules of the world - even when they do things that were thought to be impossible, there is always an explanation to come of exactly how they found the loophole in the system or rethought the problem and came out victorious.\\n\\n\r\nTech Talk - 8\\n\r\nBeing not only a magic anime, but also a tech anime, Mahouka inevitably fell into the trap of meaningless tech babble a few times. However, this didn't happen nearly as much as I expected going in, or as much as other reviewers seem to think. 95% of the time, what other reviewers have construed as tech babble actually fits the world, and makes sense once you dig in a little bit and uncover the structure of the system. This applies to both magic-related and more mundane talk; there simply isn't much actually meaningless tech babble to go around. It's all very well thought out and planned, so that even when they're speaking what would be gibberish with real world concepts, it actually fits and explains the system in a very coherent way.\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\\n\r\nI absolutely loved Mahouka. End of story. I love a show that can pull off such a complex, detailed world as this without any glaring holes. Simply wrapping my mind around the magic system was enjoyable for me, and really isn't that hard as long as you pay attention to the \"meaningless\" tech babble - like I said, almost none of it is actually meaningless. The beautiful art, well-scripted fight scenes, and layer of realistic technological detail behind it all amounts to possibly one of my favorite action-centered shows yet.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10\\n\r\nAs I said, I rate with a heavy weighting towards enjoyment. Mahouka, in my opinion, probably deserves an 8 if you take that out of the equation. The show is definitely not for everyone, with it's over-the-top exposition, incestuous undertones, and simply the sheer level of detail you need to grasp to fully understand and enjoy the show. However, if you enjoy or can put those aside, it is definitely worth the watch, and I highly recommend it. All in all, I will definitely be looking forward to the movie scheduled for July 2017.",

            "content": "I'll attempt to do my best to not reveal any spoilers but that may be difficult  in a review where it's really critical to analyze a confusing story that contained an inordinate number of characters.\r\nI'll preface this by saying that I still consider myself a relative novice in the anime community as I've really only been watching anime outside of the mainstream for the past year or so. That being said, I think I probably have seen enough to accurately judge basic elements of a show at this point. Anyway, like most shows I see these days, I didn't know much about this showbeyond the generic description provided by Netflix that this was a show about a magical high school. While this topic isn't necessarily unique at this point, it stilled piqued my interest and I don't mind school drama or magic shows.\\n\\n\r\nAs depicted in the prologue of this show, the premise was that in the 21st century, the population of Earth was ravaged by war due to an inadequate and depleting supply of natural resources. This Third World War was ended and the planet saved by magicians but the population dropped to 3 billion and the world was left to recover from the remnants.\\n\\n\r\nProblems have already crept up as early as this simple expository setting. During this story, we are told that nuclear weapons are never used. While I know that's not a serious issue and I can suspend my belief for something like this but this show constantly fails to provide basic background information. In fact Mahouka did a very poor job at world building and even after seeing the entire anime, I really don't understand this futuristic Earth. Some necessary elements that are critical for the viewer at this point might be the basic structure of the world order, where did the magicians even come from, and how does this system of magic even work? For a show whose foundation is built on a society of magic, I never fully grasped the magical system or the role of magicians within society. Now there are many shows that will present a simplistic view of magic that don't quite require any complex explanation of how things exactly work  like Fairy Tail or such. We're presented with the fact that magic exists throughout the world and individuals can learn to master and specialize in it. Mahouka does go into detail when describing how spells work but since as a viewer I never was given a rudimentary and understandable explanation of how the magic system works, there is no way I can comprehend a discussion over the course of a few minutes on the intricacies of the theories behind a particular spell. For instance, in one scene, a spell is described as the user generating three magical areas in the shape of three dimensional squares with each square being within each other and each vertex containing another magical circle with a six meter diameter or radius) which can be detonated by the user pulling the trigger on a CAD. It's pointless to have so many technical discussions like so filled with obscure jargon that is nonsensical to the viewer. I typically don't watch shows expecting to be bombarded with incomprehensible scientific facts that might be seen in high level physics courses.\\n\\n\r\nEnough of that, so after the prologue I assumed that this show was likely going to be about newly developed high school academies devoted to magic preparing their students for a world that was basically in a magical arms race. Apparently I was wrong. I can't really tell you what this show was about. Mahouka seemed to want to have every possible element in it to the point where the story was largely incoherent. The story was broken into three arcs that were fairly distinct from each other but seemed to bounce from themes of discrimination, manipulation, terrorism, athletic competition, theoretical magic, love, etc. etc. This was a mix of James Bond goes to Hogwarts where he reveals himself to be Superman who has discovered all the Dragon Balls to start a harem where he competes in the Tri-Wizard Competition and wins the Nobel prize for science and then wins the heart of his imouto...wait...he probably won the heart of his sister before the show started. ONII-SAMA!\\n\\n\r\nThe first arc focused on the fact that the high school had a discriminatory practice in place in which students who scored highly on their exams were put on the Course 1 track and called Blooms and those who didn't score as high were put on the Course 2 track and called Weeds. This system of discrimination made absolutely no sense because this high school was apparently the most prestigious high school in all of Japan and only seemed to accept the best students. Also the discrimination seemed to be something that was largely instituted by the students themselves so I'm not sure how this system became institutionalized if it wasn't done by the administration. Also, the majority of characters we are introduced to are either very sympathetic to Course 2 students (like everyone on the Student Council, what a coincidence) or Course 2 students themselves. Even though you think the first arc is going to focus and resolve this issue,  it doesn't really. Instead they have a polite discussion about how discrimination is bad but Course 2 students are in fact just lazy moochers who don't really deserve better treatment anyway...also they should give up magic if they can't cut it. There are other issues that do get resolved that are a bit bizarre in and of themselves but I've rambled for long enough.\\n\\n\r\nI guess I won't go any further with the story except to state one last point and that is that I never understood  what the antagonists' motives were during this entire show. They were largely just there for plot purposes.\\n\\n\r\nOn to the characters and there were so many of them. At times I thought I was watching one of the later seasons of Durarara except this time not only could I not recall what everyone's name was, half the characters looked so similar I had an incredibly difficult time telling them apart. Besides so many characters looking similar (there were a number of males with short mouse brown hair and then a number of females with mouse brown hair who I could not differentiate between for large portions of the show), many characters had extremely similar names. Now as a native English speaker, I already have difficulties remembering Japanese names especially considering the Japanese cultural usage of primarily using one's surname instead of first name. Anyway, as for similar names, there was a Miyuki, a Mayumi, a Masaki, a Mizuki, a Mitsui, and a Mibu. At least they referred to one character as George, I could remember that one. Anyway, even after 26 episodes, Mahouka rarely spent any time actually developing the characters. I never learned much about the backgrounds of any of the characters nor do many of them have much of a personality beyond a stereotype or caricature meant for the plot. Characters are critical for any good story but the characters in Mahouka are just quantity with absolutely no quality. I don't know anyone's underlying motivations, some of the characters' actions make no sense at all, and because of this I can't emotionally connect with anyone on any level in this show.\\n\\n\r\nI will go over the two main and most controversial characters in this show, the siblings Tatsuya and Miyuki Shiba. Now Tatsuya is a very typical overpowered character...maybe not typical in that he is perfect in everything and that's not true most of the time. Ironically, you usually only see one overpowered character but Miyuki is also overpowered. Tatsuya starts high school as a Course 2 student but we quickly learn that he is probably the most gifted magician in the entire world. The reason we're given for him being put in a lower tiered track in high school is that he apparently can't use \"practical\" magic at a great level which was part of the high school exam. Even though, he just happens to be a genius who not only can read spells as they are casted, he can invent new magical weaponry and devices, prove magical theories, disable spells, visualize through sensory magic his surroundings and individuals, make people combust, disable weapons, cast some of the highest level spells, not die, bring others back to life, program CADs, and have all the girls fall in love with him while being oblivious. He's also pretty emotionless throughout the show which is never really explained. Miyuki, on the other hand, has great capacity for normal magic and can cast some of the most devastating spells in the show but she doesn't quite have the sheer invincibility of her brother. She does have this strange, unexplained, romantic, and incestuous love for her brother which is also never explained. She even incapacitates Tatsuya at one point because he doesn't acknowledge her as a woman when she is half naked. Beyond that she often freezes the surrounding environment and loses control of her magic when she thinks Tatsuya is getting too close to other women, she nearly kisses him in one scene and then runs to her room and cries when she got caught, she rolls around half naked in her bed blushing after Tatsuya wipes her tears away, and she blushes every time Tatsuya says nice things to her. Just a normal brother and sister relationship. Miyuki went from being weird to annoying to creepy to being yandere for me. I did not like either of the main characters. If a character is going to be invincible then you need to play off that. You could go the One Punch Man route and make it a comedic parody or you could make the show about overcoming obstacles outside of sheer strength. These characters are just too perfect and while people want themselves to be perfect, watching perfection is boring.\\n\\n\r\nMahouka apparently did not fully cover the light novels and I'm not sure if there are any plans for further seasons, though I'm not sure if it would be worth it to watch Tatsuya walk through another 26 episodes unchallenged. It seems the light novels do provide some explanations past where the anime has ended but I still can't comprehend the light novels resolving all the various flaws in this story. Character development needs to come earlier and can't wait until volume 8 or so for critical background. Also no story can sustain this many characters with absolutely no development. But I can't imagine that the main characters could possibly be any better in the light novels. Tatsuya is presented as invincible. I doubt that was necessarily the animation studio's choice so I assume that comes from the light novels. Also the story is from the light novels so if the plot was nonsensical in the show, it's probably not any better there.\\n\\n\r\nI won't judge anyone who enjoyed this show or disagrees with my opinion. The ability to enjoy anything is always an incredible thing and anyone who enjoys something (as long as it's not sick and twisted or hurtful to others) has the right to it. Everyone also has the right to their own opinions because we all have different tastes. I'm sure many people hate my favorite shows but that's life for ya. \\n\\n\\n",

It was a stunning departure from the clich\u00e9 I have come to expect from media in general. \r\n How many shows have I watched where the plot is always exactly the same? In a normal anime, we know the main character is going to have a huge emotional breakdown and emerge from it with superpowers that defy logic and use them to thwart the supervillan, despite being weaker to begin with. Ok, that's cool a few times, but the more times yousee it over and over, the more you get tired of the predictability of it.\\n\\n\r\n This is not the plotline in Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei. The plot was utterly unpredictable, at least until the \"thesis arc\" brought forth a bit of deja vu, but it still managed to pull more surprises out from under the hat. \\n\\n\r\n Some very important themes were spoken here and I feel like this anime was much closer to reality than the emotional garbage spewed out by most others.

            "content": "It started off good, with an excellent premise and setting. I liked the entire cast (except Miyuki) at first, and I liked the idea of the Bloom/Weed prejudice, even if it's nothing new. But as the show went on and conflicts arose, it felt like I was watching Rhett and Link's \"Rub Some Bacon On It\" given anime from, with Tatsuya Shiba being the bacon, and with all the humor removed. (Saying \"Rub Some Tatsuya On It\" in response to my friends' problems has become an inside joke among us.) Every time a conflict arose, precious Onii-Sama would always erupt on the scene and solveit in a matter of seconds. I liked the idea of a talented Weed closing the gap between the classes, but as the show went on, I felt like it was just a half-baked attempt to make him seem sympathetic or flawed. To top it all off is the fact that he's so humble about it. I'd like it if he was a conceited, smug jerk about it better than this bland, uninteresting cardboard cutout.\\n\\n\r\nI hate Miyuki just as much, but for mostly different reasons. True, there was the whole \"that move is difficult to pull off even for experts\" thing, and the \"she's so overwhelmingly powerful that she made the EMOTIONLESS GIRL, the RUNNER-UP in the competition, CRY\" thing, which are bad enough, but mostly, it's her creepy incestuous obsession. I'd take Suguha's love for Kirito over this any day. It was still an eye-roller, but it didn't feel nearly as... revolting as Miyuki's. I'm usually a huge sucker for protective older brothers and cute younger sisters, but this pair honestly makes me want to retch every time they make eye contact. Miyuki is one of the most one-dimensional characters I've ever seen in an anime. Everything about her is just \"Onii-sama\" this and \"Onii-sama\" that, with no hint of any motivation beyond making life easier for her precious Onii-sama.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's the rest of the characters. First off is Takeaki Kirihara, probably the only character I started off not liking, then liked more as the series went on. After episode 5, he becomes a sympathetic, capable and pretty cool guy, but his transformation, to put it bluntly, was bull. He attacked a girl with lethal magic and force under the pretext of showing her that magic would forever be superior to non-magic, then later states that he did it to bring out the best in the girl he attacked. His excuse is pathetic and tacked-on, resembling something I wrote when I was making my own manga at the ripe old age of 13. And even THEN, I realized what a bad move that was. He would have been one of my favorite characters if he had just been introduced for the first time in episode 6, but as he stands now, I only like him a bit.\\n\\n\r\nPretty much the entirety of the female cast is uniform in my eyes. I liked them a lot to begin with, each with their own charms and quirks, even if a lot of them were just re-applications of old Tropes (Rei expies are always good, though). As the story went along, however, almost every one of them followed Miss Yandere in falling in love with precious, wonderful, perfect Onii-sama. Being near that man is enough to make any female cast member blush. EVEN THE EMOTIONLESS SHIZUKU! THAT'S RIGHT, EVEN THE REI AYANAMI CLONE! Her and Mibu falling for him were the last straw for me. The whole reason why people love Rei clones is entirely because of their stoicism! Having one blush and smile when alone in a room with the perfect main character whom everybody loves just shows how blatantly the creators don't understand the archetype! If a character that previously never uttered sentences longer than six words in length is suddenly talking in full paragraphs to praise almighty Onii-sama, then there is clearly something wrong with this picture! Honestly, at that point I was convinced they were just doing it on purpose.\\n\\n\r\nThe male cast members, at least, are alright, because they can't be attracted to him. Still, all of them (except Katsuto Jyumonji and people that hate sweet, precious Onii-sama) seem to rely on him to solve every single problem. I would go so far as to say that the majority of all of the characters exist SOLELY to provide means by which Onii-sama can prove that he is the very best like no one ever was.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, amid this sea of Onii-sama-worshipping zombies (and I'm not talking about the fanbase) there are still a few good characters. Mizuki Shibata and Erika Chiba are so far, two of the maybe three female characters that have gotten any focus to not show any romantic interest in him. Erika is very much a standard tsundere, but I think both of these girls have potential, and I wish they could have been the female leads instead of Miyuki. Katsuto Jumonji is probably my favorite character overall, as he's powerful but holds back quietly, leading well but not stealing the show like someone else. His quiet nature makes every time he opens his mouth to give a command its own small moment of awesome. In my opinion, anime could use many more characters like him. (To be fair, he reminds me of Onua, one of my favorite characters of all time, so I'm biased here.)\\n\\n\r\nLooking at the male characters unobjectively, Mikihiko Yoshida is probably the best. His magic is genuinely difficult to use but has much potential, is much more mysterious than the other forms, and he as a character has seen more growth than any other by the point I stopped at. I think he could have had IMMENSE potential as a main character, and I would certainly watch a spin-off show about only him.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on, in the inter-school competition, their student council seems so confident of their superiority that they're dissatisfied just having someone with half as many points as them. On top of that, it seems like only the girls get any focus while the guys are apparently only performing moderately well, which shows a thinly concealed (if even that) excuse to just focus on the pretty girls. Oh, except for Tatsuya, of course.\\n\\n\r\nTo reiterate: Why don't we see any of the male competitors? Because the viewers want to watch their waifus dominate. Why are the male competitors doing so poorly? Because we need Tatsuya to fix everything so that the girls make up for them.\\n\\n\r\nAt this point, the show is unwatchable for anyone with common story writing sense and self-respect. No dedicated author who knows his stuff could watch this show and not come out of it feeling dirty by the time they've gotten to around episode 9.\\n\\n\r\nAs an added thought, a lot of people praise the ingenuity of the magic system in the show, but I feel it is over-hyped, and not really all that spectacular. It's original, and I by no means dislike it, but I feel like people put this aspect up on a pedestal, and some even give the show a perfect rating purely due to it, which, with an anime this horrible, is a crime of the highest degree.\\n\\n\r\nA part of its mediocrity is the fact that, to this point, the magic battles are hardly spectacular. You don't get the sort of trading of magic attacks that could be found in, say, Fullmetal Alchemist or Fairy Tail. I wouldn't attribute this purely to the magic itself, of course, it's simply that the most spectacular aspect of the battles is the physical part, while the magic either just adds a sparkly, mystical side to it, or otherwise provides a simple and easy way to just end the battle before a real exchange of blows has begun. This aspect alone, I would rate 7/10 at MOST. Intriguing, but nothing to write home about.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now we come to Suzaku. Or whatever his name was. I liked this guy, and even though I didn't think for a minute that he could pull it off, I still hoped he could pull Onii-sama down a notch. True to my expectations, he failed, despite getting close. Some might argue it was good that he technically beat Tatsuya, but the moment was so short it took away all of the potential. Tatsuya immediately heals himself and unleashes a sonic boom, ending the match. I lost interest after the student council finished discussing it and stopped watching there entiely, deciding to pretend Tatsuya stayed dead and everyone lived happily ever after.\\n\\n\r\n\"But it gets better later!\" some say. To which I say \"Later is TOO late!\" If you want a good series, you need to start off well and keep it there, something this show failed spectacularly at. Onii-sama sucks any sense of danger out of the story, and Miyuki layers a load of revolting incest on top of the show's desiccated remains, resulting in a mess of utter garbage. Now, I am by no means an expert, and the pool of anime I've watched is shallow, but as far as my experience goes, this anime is the worst I have ever watched, and I would give it a solid 0, it is just that bad.\\n\\n\r\nThere IS one way to salvage the show, though. First off, kill Tatsuya, then make Miyuki commit suicide. With the two of them gone, the rest of the characters should become capable of standing up without Tatsuya designing new legs for them. Of course, we all know this is never going to happen, so with that I'll end my rant here by saying this show is a cesspool of everything that can go wrong with a good idea, and that I can't understand how anybody could possibly give it a rating of more than 5/10 after watching past episode nine.",

            "content": "Now I'll admit this show isn't for everyone. However, I'll try to explain why I enjoyed it and yes I'm hoping for a second season. First of all the characters: \r\nTatsuya is by far a favorite of mine. I think he's for a certain type of audience however. If you enjoy the overpowered, incredibly intelligent type who you kinda already know will win then he's your type (Sherlock holmes is an example of this type). As someone who goes to a school for the \"gifted\" ( yeah that's what they call it, it's stupid) where 9 year olds are in calculus I enjoyed the waythey portrayed the emotional gap that many intelligent people face. Everything needs to be rational meaning that emotions are often ignored or thought of as useless. Tatsuya was very good at portraying this in a similar way to how I encounter it in my everyday life. \\n\r\nI also enjoyed the way they didn't create an atmosphere where it was okay to think that pure equality was possible. The way the show portrayed how every person has both strengths and weaknesses and therefore nothing can be entirely equal was wonderful. I'm sick of shows sympathizing with characters who believe that simply because they lack in one area that they're useless. (Spoilers) when one of the characters fought for equal rights for less magically talented people at a magic high school I was very glad that Tatsuya pointed out the irrationality of that and the way people simply complain about inequality yet never propose a solution. At my school I am what you would call a \"weed\" among nine year old geniuses I expect to be treated as lesser. It only makes sense as its a school and therefore being smart is highly valued, just as at this magic school being magical is highly valued. \\n\r\nNext, the long magic explanations. I can understand where this can get boring but as I'm highly interested in science getting to see the mechanics of the world and its magic was amazing. I liked getting to work through the ideas and think about their applications. I often get frustrated when these things are not explained so this show was perfect for me in that respect. The fact that the writers took the time to think about the mechanics of the world in such depth was very impressive. \\n\r\nOn the down side, I found miyuki's obsession with her brother rather odd, along with the way the characters constantly pointed out the immodesty of the girls' outfits while the camera provided lingering boob shots. But hey animes fan service so I didn't really expect anything different.",

            "content": "So here's another one of my short reviews. The animation in this production is fantastic, bright vivid colours that catch your eye from the very start. If you liked Sword Art Online, you'll probably like this. People who hated SAO, I'd recommend to stay away. The main character is extremely OP and is incapable of dying. Besides that, I find the characters in this anime somewhat enjoyable, the story line seemed a bit clouded at first, however as the anime progressed I felt there was more momentum. Hopefully there will be a second season to elaborate on the gaps in the plot but in allhonesty I was so caught up in the moment I didn't really care. If you take this anime for it's positives rather than it's negatives you'll find it's a pretty down right awesome experience.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime was enjoyable for me, I found myself watching several episodes before looking at my watch and realising it was 3AM. If you want to watch an anime that has to do with pretty girls, school life, magic and a pretty decent storyline without having boobs shoved in your face every 2nd episode. Then this is the one for you. If you're looking for something with an in depth storyline and plot twists.. then it really isn't. Unless they start revealing some of our answered questions in the 2nd season, I will wait with anticipation. Until then, this anime gets a thumbs up from me!",

            "content": "After watching this series, I was left with a sense of profound disappointment. I loved the premise and the setting of the show which deals with a tightly integrated science and magic fusion. Also the concept of the quiet, loner boy who was the 'weakest' but secretly most overpowered character is an oft repeated and well loved theme in all forms of media. Yet at the end, I was left feeling that this series could have been so much more.\r\nA good story has to have 2 elements - relatable characters and suspense/tension.\r\nUnfortunately Mahouka does it's best to keep it's audience at arm's length while failingto provide any suspense or tension as the story progresses. I have nothing against characters progressing to overpoweredness or having secret weapons, yet there should always be a sense of growth through conflict and that there is something at stake or a cost to be paid.\\n\\n\r\nI won't go into spoilers but suffice to say that there is no sense of development in the relationships between Tatsuya, his sister nor his classmates/teammates. As you watch you wonder, what's wrong with the characters? Do they not have feelings? There is a vague sense of unease that the only relationship is a semi incestous one between the siblings but no sense of romantic tension with other characters.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, without the risk of defeat or loss, the story fails to engage and excite the viewers. The fight scenes while well drawn, do not really convey any emotional impact. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, this is a very disappointing series. For a truly rollicking and exciting ride, I would recommend Code Geass - that is a series with true twists, turns, highs and lows. As it is, Mahouka started off with promise but ultimately faded without a whimper.",

            "content": "I can start off by saying  that this anime is not for everyone. If you're looking for intense action throughout the series, you're not gonna get it in Mahouka Koukou.  However, if you are open minded and you can accept the fact that the series is very complex when comes to its lore and you appreciate how much effort the author has given to expanding a mere book, then you'll probably love this series. Mahouka Koukou has lots of dialogue and that is not a bad thing in my honest opinion. On the contrary, few anime series barely gives you enough story andinformation and makes the story feel hollow and unfinished with many plot holes. Many for some reason find the excess of the plot to be unattractive, but I find it to be Mahoukas strongest point. Here is my review of Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei:\\n\\n\r\nStory: The story is very straightforward and intense at times. While the whole incest topic is taboo among many viewers, I actually kinda supported the ship. It didn't feel too disgusting, not even the scenes where it was taken to another level. Yes, Miyuki might be one of the biggest bro-con in anime history but I felt like the incest in this anime made the series better. I am not quite sure why but somehow, the series got a trademark which of course makes it stand out. It dares to go beyond the norms that are accepted but not too greatly as to gross out the audience. Another plot thing that has been done before that I enjoyed was Tatsuya's background. He is unable to feel any strong emotions. The only emotion he has left is his protection and love for his younger sister. Tatsuya might seem weak, but Mahouka actually shows off his strongest points. Tatsuya is a bad ass! The other protagonist is Shiba Miyuki, the ice queen and Tatsuya's younger sister. She is strong, beautiful, independent and perfect in every way. Her only weakness is her forbidden love for her brother.  While she is the flawless and perfect one, Tatsuya is the irregular and worst one (oh the irony). In reality, Tatsuya is made to look like the perfect one and Miyuki the worst ones thanks to the plot. Almost every time a problem shows up, Tatsuya is the one who fixes it. I really liked this twist in the anime. Now, the actual plot is about Tatsuya who enrolls to Mahouka Koukou as a reserve or Weed while Miyuki enrolls as a Bloom, one with better test results and stronger magic capabilities. Right off the bat, we get introduced to fantastic characters who are friends with the siblings, all with varied and unique characteristics. Miyuki is adored by the entire school due to her being a Bloom as well as good looking while Tatsuya is discriminated and looked down upon for being a Weed. Yes, a cast system at a high school. This discrimination is short lived for Tatsuya as he proves himself to be more than meets the eyes. I won't spoil why but it's definitely badass. \\n\r\nTL: DR\\n\r\nIt's about two siblings who enroll to a school where one of them is discriminated and the other adored. The older brother joins the student council and gets involved in serious shit. The rest is about a sort of contest between different schools and action happens. \\n\\n\r\nArt: The art style is fantastic and it has that subtle futuristic feel to it. The colors are vibrant and make the world feel alive, being a perfect mix between redundant and realistic. The characters look unique and they really fit the story of the series looks. Background and nature are not the focal points of the anime but they look very nice and I didn't notice anything strange about them as the series progressed. There isn't a lot to say about the art other than what has already been talked about so I am moving on.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I must start off by saying that the two main protagonists Tatsuya and Miyuki's VA did an outstanding job voicing them. They fit the characters perfectly and were exactly how I wanted them before the series came out (I read the light novels before). They are flawless and I  doubt anyone else could have done a better job, let alone compare. The music intense during action scenes and has a techno vibe to it. During dialogues, the music is calm and relaxing. I think the music is superb, but the only thing that's missing are a bit more varied music. Some tracks repeat themselves.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: The action scenes are very fun to watch with really cool moves being performed. Couple that with the outstanding animation and you get some of the best action in anime history. I feel that the number of action scenes can be a bit underwhelming and the dialogues that dominate can be off-putting but nevertheless, it is still really enjoyable. That isn't to say that you can enjoy the series dialogues but if you are looking for nonstop battles, look somewhere else. Oddly enough, the incest can be quite enjoyable as it is almost comedic at times. Romance is not the focus of the anime but the only romance you'll find is the incest. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I think Mahouka is one of the best anime in recent years. It really is good and enjoyable to watch. I highly recommend watching it, even if you find some of the stuff to be unenjoyable. Give it a watch and judge after the first four episodes or so.",

            "content": "*This review might contain spoilers* \r\nI normally don't write reviews but I had to get this off my chest. Not the best review ever ( maybe the worst.) There is a TL:DR at the end.\r\nMahouka Koukou no Rettousei was an enjoyable in the first episodes. I assumed that the show would be great since the Light Novels were the most popular in Japan and U.S. (I think U.S.) It even had potential to be amazing. Boy was I disappointed when I finished the show. Still unsure why I went all the way to end of the show when I could have just dropped it inthe middle.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3/10\\n\r\nI'm aware that the story gets better after the end of the adaptation but I will only review the ones the adpated. The story is either everywhere or it just drags on for like 8-9 episodes. The show is pretty much fillers the entire time with no clear story spotted. As for pacing, its like a fat kid running as fast as he can for a little then to walking .1 Mph ( .016 KmpH.) \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 2/10\\n\r\nThe main character Tatsyua is like Kirito (Sword Art Online) since Tatsyua is so damm overpowered and looks perfect. He can solve problems that people have and fix it in a fucking flash! Dude calculate pretty much any magic and what that spell would be. He can see through walls and even win a fight just by snapping his fingers. Also can REVIVE PEOPLE BACK FROM THE DEAD with his magic. The man even killed guys with one punch to the face. His Sister has a thing for him and almost did something that me yell at my TV for almost doing what she was about to do. As for the supporting characters, they were to many of them and they were flat and static as hell (Shizuku best girl.) Even the villlians were just carboard since there is nothing behind them and just terrorists \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10 \\n\r\nEven though the show had some problems, what made the show a little bit better was the artstyle. For me, I really enojyed this the most of the show. Character designs were fantasic and I will admit that they looked good. the only problem I had was the kind of colours it used since most of the show I saw white that any other colour but it was a big deal.  \\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nThe VA's did a great job for there character roles. But other than, it was the soundtrack that brought the score down. For me, It was not that good. I didn't like the music choices that they used for the fights and the score just seemed forgetable. As for OP/ED, that was the only nice ones.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\r\nEven if I gave the show low marks. I still enjoyed the show. The only reason for enjoying it was because I turned off my brain and sat back. At glance, Tatsyua might be the most bad ass person in the world. If your brain is off, you will enjoy the show. If you leave it on, you will hate the show with a flamming passion.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\r\nSome people loved this show to death while others want to see it rot in hell with School Days or some other show. For me I just don't want to see this show or hear about again with it's bad storytelling and boring characters.\\n\\n\r\nTL:DR: Mahouka has good Art while everything else sucks. No good se\u00f1or.",

            "content": "Going into this anime, I was expecting a borderline average plot about some school that does magic and a character that has to prove themselves despite their position. What I found was something unexpected, with quite a few things worse than my initial assumptions, but somehow made up for with a few absolutely brilliant things.\r\nCharacter (5/10): This is the worst area for a reason, it simply didn't develop enough.\r\n+ Tatsuya (The main character) is a total badass. Although little about who he actually is and why is shown by the end, small things manage to build up piece by piece parts of who he is.While it appears that his only emotions are related to his sisters wellbeing, over time this just doesn't appear to be wholly true.\\n\r\n+ The student president as a counterweight to Tatsuya and her own ideals was pretty interesting.\\n\\n\r\n- Tatsuya really wasn't developed on enough.\\n\r\n- The student president was generally sidelined, and her relation to Tatsuya grows to be just like the others over time.\\n\r\n- Every other character (I'll give credit to Erika now for being one other who has some other defining characteristics) seems to be built on their relation to Tatsuya; Some characters would follow him even if he was a lemming jumping off a cliff, some only revolve around a rivalry or desire to destroy him. There is no in between for some reason and this kind of destroys and nuance between characters apart from their magical powers.\\n\r\n- There is a really overplayed and in your face thing between Tatsuya and his sister. From Episode 1 it goes on and while it seems to be some unrequited romance, it is kind of unnecessary, and the time could have gone into other characters development.\\n\\n\r\nStory (6/10): The story seems to be more focused on power building than anything else.\\n\\n\r\n+ A positive of not knowing a lot about Tatsuya for a lot of this is that anything which reveals more is actually genuinely interesting. In this sense, the pacing of the story is actually decent.\\n\r\n+ While not integral to the main plot, the story does at times tackle some interesting questions such as whether people just go after their perception of equality for their own position, or if they actually believe in going into it for merits sake.\\n\r\n+ While few moments actually make it in, some of the comedy here was pretty good.\\n\\n\r\n- There really wasn't enough development of the main antagonist(s) going into the next season. They did something to Tatsuya and seem evil is about as far as it goes.\\n\r\n- The story is kind of let down by the characters. A lot of the plot seems to be taken up with keeping characters relevant whenever Tatsuya gains power himself.\\n\r\n- The characters though are also let down by the story. The story essentially reverts them to deus ex machina devices who advance the plot in various ways. Additionally, some arcs appeared rushed, leading to underdeveloped antagonising characters who were a disappointment compared what they were expected to be.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10): This goes along with the sound to make the absolute highlights of the anime.\\n\\n\r\n+ The battle scenes are amazing.\\n\r\n+ The battle scenes last a long time and are amazing.\\n\r\n+ Did I mention that my God the battle scenes are amazing?\\n\r\n+ There is some awesome art at the second ending which just somehow makes Tatsuya seem even more badass than he already is.\\n\\n\r\n- I'm only going to begrudge them a very small amount for not being Ufotable Fate Zero level of style in the fights.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10): While it doesn't have a real negative, it's not a 10 because I've heard better.\\n\\n\r\n+ This goes brilliantly with the fight scenes.\\n\r\n+ I really found the second opening to have quite good music.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10): You should have guessed it: The fight scenes make this anime.\\n\\n\r\n+ The fight scenes. Yes i'll mention it multiple times because every time I saw one in an episode I remembered why I was watching one after another.\\n\r\n+ The pacing of this wasn't fast enough to confuse me, but neither was it slow enough to bore me.\\n\\n\r\n- The brother sister thing really wasn't needed in this and kinda threw me off at points.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10): Main points of both good and bad:\\n\\n\r\n+ Yep the fight scenes will keep you coming back. I'm not sure if that's more just because you learn more about Tatsuya or more because they are actually brilliant, so I'll go 50/50 on both.\\n\r\n+ The soundtrack on this one is actually pretty good.\\n\r\n+ It didn't give away enough that I did want to watch more episodes.\\n\\n\r\n- The brother sister thing again. It kind of puts a dent in an otherwise completely different story.\\n\r\n- The characters are seriously lacking in some respects. A couple are pretty good, but most are too generalised.\\n\r\n- The story essentially feels like a set-up to a bigger season. While I don't mind that terribly, it does feel like some things were intentionally not developed on in order to make this the case.\\n\\n\r\nOverall while Mahouka appears for the time being to be lacking in the overarching plot, and has deficient characters, it's good enough overall to retain interest throughout the whole series.",

Characters are already well developed in meany layers that keeps your attentions then other anime that might be base in the same Genres. \r\nStory:7\r\n   Even though the story/plot has alot of depth to it, I began to feel there was to much going on and by the end I had more questions then I started with.\r\nArt:9I love the art in this anime, they spells are flashy and explosive. The nominal seance are not down played Visually, however the art for example  when they were dancing made me go ew did they get lazy and CG it.\\n\\n\r\nSound:10\\n\r\n    All i can say is there was alot of attention to the sounds accompanying for every action. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\n   Hmmm... Miyuki a sister with a brother complex that leaves you face palming wile you try not to laugh. Tatsuya a brothers who can only feel emotion when its connected to his sister. If you have a problem with implied incest you might not want to watch Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei. Even with the comic relief of sibling love that borders on funny, there is lot of character depth in this show that slowly peels it layers away as the show goes on.just for the record my favorite character is Erika.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:9\\n\r\n   there is a good amount of fan service in this anime that dose not over shadow the action and vary base of the anime AE the magic. I really enjoyed this anime and when/if there's a season 2 I will be watching it for sure.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\n  I gave this anime an 8 because there are some things that annoy me but not enough to dissuade any one form watching the one. I really enjoy having an action based anime not bomb on the plot with being over flashy or go way over the top on fan service.\\n\\n",

            "content": "This is my favorite anime. It's one of the few \"smart\" anime out there, it's beautiful in its art, and there are plenty of characters to love. By smart, I mean it feels as though a physicist or an engineer wrote this story. The theme is that magic has long been dismissed as legend and is now technology and goes into great detail on how spells work and magical theory. It is a bit hard to follow if you don't pay close attention or are uninterested, but there are 4-5 short episodes that you can watch to prepare for the show, which explains how magicand the society works, as well as introduces some of the characters. There are a few things that many people don't seem to enjoy about the show, one being the science of it, as I mentioned. The other aspects involve incest and the main character's emotionless state. The love between brother and sister in this story leads to a lot of implied incest themes, which goes beyond the norm, but hey some people are into that. However, this relationship is explained further on in the story and if you're not into the semi-incest then bear with it and see that there's more to it later in the show and in the manga. The main character, Tatsuya Shiba, is often considered by viewers as emotionless and cold and hard to like. However, he is supposed to be that way and there are reasons that you will see later in the show and it is well worth it once you realize how he's one of the most OP, badass characters ever created. If I were to be any character I'd want to be him because he is charismatic, intelligent, a natural leader, confident, and has goals and everyone in the show loves him. The other characters are very likable and the class president Mayumi Saegusa has effectively become one of my fav anime crushes. I definitely recommend this show but be sure to keep an open mind throughout.",

The irregular in question, has a sis-com and a big secret.\r\nNow, Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei has plenty of ups and downs. Unfortunately, I believe I can list more downs than ups. \r\nBefore I begin, I would like to tell you, I'm judging the anime to after I have read several of the novels, the anime covers the first 7 novels of the series.\r\nWhen I watched it for the first time, I thought it was an amazing anime. This is because of the plot and the logical explanations of why themagic worked and partially watching a supposedly low achiever (the underdog, or as they say, the weed) be better than people who are supposed to be better than him (the blooms). However most of the anime was logical explanations of magic. \\n\\n\r\nThere were lots of names and characters to be wary of, there were figuratively +10 names you had to remember to understand the dialogue. I had to watch the episode several times and use the wiki to pinpoint who was who when watching the anime. It got frustrating. \\n\\n\r\nThen, there's the magic. The characters got shocked with the magic being used, but because we're not in their world, we can't understand why they were shocked, we can't understand why that bit of magic was impressive compared to the rest of the magic and why some people couldn't use magic that others could (I\u2019m excluding Tatsuya, because he has a reasonable reason as to why he can and cannot do some magic).\\n\\n\r\nWatching the anime, you will come across a lot of things you just won't understand, for example, what they are doing, why they are doing it, what they are thinking and, just what can the main character, Tatsuya, do??\\n\\n\r\nTo answer these questions, you will need to use the wiki or read the novels.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the anime when I first watched it, watching it after reading the novels, not so much.\\n\\n\r\nOn the contrary, I would recommend people to read the novels and answer the questions you still have from the anime.\\n\\n\r\nHonsetly, I lowered my original rating for the anime after reading the novels because the anime cut out a lot of parts I felt were crucial to the story and they altered several parts of the story. I bumped the anime down a whole 2 grades upon the second viewing. On the up side, the anime does help you comprehend what the novel is talking about.",

            "content": "Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei or The Irregular at Magic High School as it is known in English, delivers in depth knowledge of magic, incest, op characters, and cartoony villains all with mixed results.\r\nStory: 5/10\r\nThe setting takes place in the distant future, in the year 2095. By this time, magic has become the ultimate source of power and whoever has the gift to control it can achieve greatness. The story follows Tatsuya Shiba and his younger sister Miyuki as they navigate and adapt to their new settings at the prestigious First High School for magic. Tatsuya is placed in the Course 2 classes after excelling inone area of the entrance exams and failing the other area being labeled a \"weed\", while Miyuki tops the entrance exams and is place in the Course 1 classes being labeled a \"bloom\". The story is separated into 3 different arcs: the Enrollment Arc, the Nine Schools Competition Arc, and the Yokohama Disturbance Arc. The Enrollment Arc follows Tatsuya and Miyuki as they adapt to their new high school and meet new friends such as: Erika Chiba, Leo Saijo, Mihiko Yoshida, and Mizuki Shibata. This arc includes themes of discrimination and espionage, in which Tatsuya gets caught in the crosshairs when he befriends another Course 2 student named Mibu, who becomes involved in an anti-magic terrorist group known as Blanche as well as a group that protests the labels \"weed\" and \"bloom\", and the main plot involves thwarting their plot. I would have to say that this was the most interesting arc of the entire anime, even though that it is more or less forgotten by the beginning of the next arc and not really connected to it either. The Second Arc is the Nine Schools Competition Arc, where Tatsuya and friends compete in an Olympic style competition to determine which school has the best magicians. This is the arc where I lost interest in this series as it was nothing more than info dump after info dump and showcased how OP the characters were with its predictable ending. Finally, the third arc is the Yokohama Disturbance Arc, where after Tatsuya is given almost all the credit for the predictable victory of the last arc, he continues to show how OP he is during another competition and ensuing battle with another terrorist organization. If these last two arcs sound silly to anyone, its because they are. I mean come on a terrorist organization that targets a group of OP high school magicians, how wacky, cartoonish, and outlandish can this plot possibly become?\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4/10\\n\r\nEasily the weakest component of this anime was the character cast. The supporting cast is quite possibly the weakest cast of any anime I've ever seen. But as for the main characters first you have:\\n\r\nTatsuya Shiba: He's our main protagonist, introduced as the titular \"irregular\", he is initially portrayed as an underdog that we're supposed to feel sympathy for, however, that trait is quickly put to bed when we discover by the second episode just how OP, he is when he defeats the Vice President of the Student Council in the mere matter of a few seconds! Talk about OP!!! As for his personality, he's pretty dull, socially inept, somewhat robotic, and maybe even a little arrogant. It also doesn't hurt that literally every FUCKING girl has to point out how great he is!!!!!!! He's just a cookie cutter Gary Stu, a boring, bland shounen protagonist.\\n\r\nNext we have:\\n\r\nMiyuki Shiba: She's Tatsuya's younger sister, and hands down the most annoying character in the entire anime. Each of her scenes vary from cringe inducing to just plain stupid. She has zero character development and exists solely for the point of trying to make Tatsuya more human and care for something when he barely shows any emotion throughout the entire anime. Her biggest character trait, is her incestuous love for her older brother. Now let me mind you, I'm an American and here, incest is considered taboo and held in very low moral standing, so I'll go ahead and say that I fucking hate when this particular storyline is used to enhance the drama of any anime, I find it very unnecessary. So, needless to say I never warmed up to Miyuki's character at all, she was nothing more than a Mary Sue to Tatsuya's Gary Stu, a product of the occasional untasteful type of fanservice, and an incestuous pervert who almost went so far as to attempt to  violate her own brother in his FUCKING SLEEP!!!!!\\n\\n\r\nNext, before I give a very brief description about the supporting cast, I thought I would focus on the dynamic of the sibling relationship between Tatsuya and Miyuki, that didn't involve incest. I honestly didn't find their relationship all that great. It lacked the close bond that exists between siblings in most shounen anime and I found that disappointing. It's also why I think incest in anime is a shitty plot device because it takes away from what could've have been a compelling strong point for the series.\\n\\n\r\nNow as for the supporting cast, you aren't going to find anyone dynamic. The female side of the gender coin basically drools over Tatsuya and constantly praises him for how wonderful he is, while the male cast simply acts as Tatsuya's support whenever necessary, and nothing more. The only supporting character that I found decent were Erika, Leo, and Mikihiko if they had received more development or were the main characters then this could have been a better story, imo.\\n\\n\r\nNow that my rant on most of the negatives of this anime is finished I will now focus on the positives.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThe art and animation were produced by Madhouse one of the greatest anime studios our there. The characters were well drawn and the setting was also quite lovely. The animation is also a high point and executed well during the battle scenes, despite the OP nature of the characters, but I digress.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThe music in Irregular at Magic High School was excellent on the other hand. LiSA's  \"Rising Hope\" was used as the first opening theme and imo is the best song used in the anime, she has also done some excellent music for other popular anime such as: Angel Beats!, Sword Art Online, and Fate/Zero. The second opening \"grilletto\" by GARNiDELiA was also quite catchy. The endings were fine as well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\r\nDespite its many flaws, I did enjoy this anime to an extent. I enjoyed the first half particularly more than the second half. As noted before, my interest in the series waned after the unwarranted Tatsuya praise. This anime ranged from occasionally fun and illogical to sinfully boring.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nOne final note, I have not read the light novel that the source material is based off for this anime adaptation, so I can't comment on which is better.\\n",

            "content": "Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei or known as The Irregular at Magic High School, is a future based anime that is usually passed on due to its title or some other reasoning. I'll be reviewing this anime with the knowledge of reading the LNs' and rewatching the anime a few times. Note that I did not read the fan translated light novels and I read the Original Japanese version instead due to unofficial translations, please understand. The fanbase's translations may be done really close but I'd prefer to read the original if I can.\r\nThis anime has many pluses that make it interesting and great.\r\n1. The artworkand animations are great. Not a single thing threw me off besides something I'll tell later on.\\n\\n\r\n2. The voice actors did an amazing job connecting with the characters personalities and emotion.\\n\\n\r\n3. Our protagonist is a badass including his little sister.\\n\\n\r\n4. Comical timing is done really well, each time something funny came up, I got a laugh out of it.\\n\\n\r\n5. The explanations behind how something happened are explained really great, almost anyone can understand the most confusing thing if they pay attention.\\n\r\n6. A simple and well though out or straight forward plot.\\n\\n\r\nBasically, what I'm saying is that if you like action, this show's got it.\\n\r\nIf you like great artwork, this show's got it.\\n\r\nIf you like Imoutos', this show's got it. \\n\r\nIf you like badass characters, this show's got it. \\n\r\nIf you like great explanations on behind a situation, this show's got it.\\n\r\nIf you like school life anime, this show's got it.\\n\r\nIf you like stuff like that, watch this anime, the following cons will not stop you from enjoying it.\\n\\n\r\nLike many anime, this one is not perfect. Despite having many great things about it, there's a hefty amount of cons...\\n\\n\r\n1. Characters, meaning the side and supporting characters that is. The characters introduced later in the story, lets take Kei for example, have no background or true motives. We have no information on what's their personality, goals, and skills. Literally, the only reason they're introduced is just to hang out with the main protagonist, Shiba Tatsuya, because somehow, people gravitate to his character. If they weren't even introduced, the anime itself would not be even changed at the least if they were removed.\\n\\n\r\n2. Like many anime of this generation, CGI, or Computer Generated Images, has become a commonplace. This anime has quite the amount of them too. Because how well the artwork is, it makes CGI stand out way too much in comparison. You'll see CG models either walking, sitting, or just being there in the background. Just to fill in as students of sorts. But what surprised me is that how hidden they are, sometimes you cannot even notice that they're CGI, unless you're paying attention or just really good at noticing the difference. I saw them as blurry characters in backgrounds.\\n\\n\r\n3. Random ass OST. In some scenes, they'll just play music that doesn't even match with the situation. The OST isn't bad or anything, it's just the really bad timing of music placement. \\n\\n\r\n4. New people to anime may find the Bro/Sis-Con relationship really disturbing in a way.\\n\\n\r\n5. They try to force a somewhat harem onto Tatsuya, but he does not give a damn.\\n\\n\r\n6. Plot holes, a lot of them too. If you're an anime adept, you can figure these out pretty easy.\\n\\n\r\nI gave this anime an 8/10. The reason is that, the anime itself was interesting and fun to watch. Compared to the light novel, I ma say it was a bit rushed but in the end it was great otherwise. Anyone who likes this type of genre will enjoy the show to the fullest no matter the cons. It was worth my time and surely mostly a lot of other's too. This show, in my opinion is suitable for newcomers and veterans alike. If you want to watch something good to watch to pass time or spend your free time, go ahead and pick this up. It'll be worth your time. You have a synopsis of the anime provided by MAL, go check it out.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nP.S.\\n\r\nOnii-Sama is badass.",

            "content": "Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei is a mixed bag of good fights - exzellent art and music and story but unfortunately a bad deconstruction and character development. Its sounds harsh, but it makes it a choice, like it or like it not - it ultimately needs investment and it isnt easy to simply sit down and look it. It feels a little rushed, let me explain why:\r\nThe story has you follow Tatsuya Shiba and his (not so) younger sister Miyuki. They both live in a world where magic became a part of the military arsenal, magicians are trained to be death machines and dominate their battlefield,for this 10 highschools opened and Miyuki and her Brother join the First High. \\n\r\nWhat you will notice in the very first episode already, is the very overly attached sisterly love that miyuki has (which sometimes extends to rather akward situations.) For Bleach -Fans , im not talking from a combination like Byakuya und Rukia, but a much more attached one.\\n\r\nAnyways, the two of them join the highschool and after passing the test , they are confronted with some of their classmates being bullied from people that have a flower sign on their vest.\\n\r\nThis will be explained in the next episode but basically , the schools do separate classes for weaker and for superior magicians and call them ,,Weed'' and ,,Bloom''. Unfortunately you see very often that Tatsuya or his friends are underestimated for this reason and like you surely can guess, their enemy was defeated anyways.\\n\\n\r\nThis is however a major plotpoint, since what happens next is a quarrel between two kendo clubs , tatsuya - now joint forces with the disciplinary squad- saw them being buliied. The captain of the Weed-Kendo club -Mibu wanted then to talk to him. She said she felt herself and the other ,,weed'' student bullied and wants tatsuya to help her change that, yet he finds her resolve not worthy and thus he left her sitting. \\n\r\nLater you find out that she has been decieved by an enemy organisation and ,,Blanche'' which wants to attack japan and take informations from their main database. \\n\\n\r\nThe point is that the story seems very fast, even with 26 episodes you feel like everything runs from a-b in split seconds - trying to explain or leave it open. What is surely new and refreshing is the Art style and the premise. In that world ,2 different kinds of magic exist, first is modern magic which bases itself around a CAD - a device that a magician wears as a cuff or weapon to amplify spells fast. And older spirit magic, which requires time for the magician to prepare. Both are very well introduced and fit to the universe, it is especially shown at the end of the first arc - when they hold a competition between the schools, thus a good amount of cool and interesting spells are seen.\\n\\n\r\nSound is...not very interesting , that is if you are a sound lover like me. The first opening and the fighting theme nail it with a techno-ish beat. It makes you feel pumped for the fight and be like ,,yeah!! beat him down!'' I ultimately dont remember any other theme to be exceptionally special. It was a little bit disappointing for me, at least in this point.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters, are honestly not that well explained - or at least , there were often things that were questionable which ultmatively lead to read the manga or the novel for more information. One particular scene bothers me very very much , while the other ones could be understood to an amount, this one really is not an understandable choice for me. In an episode at the end, where the Great Asian Alliance attacks, was the first high school cornered in a conference room. The military (naturally) comes conveniently to save them before the main enemy force could join and proceed then to greet Tatsuya as their special officer ,,oguro''. Now you'd expect his friends to say something like : ,,Omg Tatsuya, Why didnt you tell?'' or something like that - right? Doesnt Happen. Everyone seems calm and confused even though it was confirmed that their friend was a super agent, working for the military. Later Miyuki even explains that he has a live saving ability and their was no question at all like ,,Why does he have that? Why didnt he tell us?'' Its a bit strange and makes you feel weird.\\n\\n\r\nOverall however, I think I had a good time with looking the story. Even though it is sometimes extremely confusing, there are also a lot of times where you get good and exciting fights and themes.\\n\\n\r\nThats why I issue Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei a 7.5-8.\\n\\n\r\nI hope this review could help you, dear reader :)",

            "content": "=MAY CONTAIN SPOILER=\r\nThe Anime starts at the year 2095 where magic is a reality and instead of using weapons to fight war they use magicians that was trained thru the 9 affiliated Magic schools by the government. The anime contains 3 arcs from the LN plus one if you include the movie \r\nFirst arc is enrollment arc where they introduce the First High, the school of the MC, each school has 2 courses in which called blooms and weeds (Reserves) the students are put to a certain course based on their magic activation grades etc but not based on combat like hand to hand andmilitary grade magic and this is where the MC comes in with her blood related sister \\n\\n\r\nThe MC known as Shiba Tatsuya or Godsuya either is fine is placed as a course 2 student (weed) and his sister Shiba Miyuuki top 1 of the upcoming 1st years and placed as course 1 student (bloom)\\n\\n\r\nFirst Arc is Mostly Discrimination between blooms and weeds\\n\r\nSecond Arc is some sort of school olympics where they battle plenty of events all 9 schools competing\\n\r\nThird arc another school competing event but in magic thesis\\n\\n\r\nThe anime focuses on action and fantasy magic with explanation (quite hard to understand at first) the story itself is great making a future world where magic is invented and things the may lead into potential world breaking problems,\\n\r\nThe Animation and Sounds are greatly synced into together and when magic fighting they did not save budget on anything just watching tatsuya handle hand to hand combat in the first episode is already amazing \\n\r\nCharacters are great with each individual having development AND NOT FALLING in love with the MC where other characters get their own relationships but do take in note the incest between the MCs but dont let it annoy you they wont do something that couples usually do yeah they tease people thru words only tho (for now) theres a reason why they have a relationship like that will be slightly explained thru out the anime\\n\r\nI enjoyed the anime so much where the MCs is too OP but not well known and well done i rewatched the anime 8+ times and will rewatch it more! The action is trilling and exciting with the combination of synced sounds animation.... \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall Anime is 10/10 (id give LN 11/10)\\n\r\nThe anime would be better if the magic is explained more (i read some of the LN to understand the background and Magic use)\\n\r\nJust don't mind the incest and you'll be fine\\n\r\nHoping for season 2 so they can explain briefly about the Magic And Background of the fantasy world",

            "content": "During and after World War III, magic became the main military weapon, that is to say, not only military but also civil. This magic is a little different from what we see in other anime, it's a kind of technological magic activated from CAD's that I'll talk about next. CAD's (Casting Assistent Device) are instruments that help in the use of the spell leaving it stronger depending on the user. Usually CAD's look similar to cell phones and calculators (actually look more like \"metal wallets\"), but they can also resemble bracelets, gloves, cards, weapons and even swords. To use magic, the characters enter a seriesof codes pertaining to the desired spell. A concussion in the concept of student values begins to occur with the arrival of Tatsuya Shiba, a new student of course two, who despite being harassed and despised by many students of course one, proves to be a true genius with great skills and powers, the Which go completely unnoticed in fitness tests. This shows that the evaluation system is too generic to assess individual talents and that they completely escape established standards.\\n\\n\r\nTatsuya Shiba(\u53f8\u6ce2 \u9054\u4e5f)\\n\r\nTatsuya is the main male protagonist of the work, he is a tall young man, with a good athletic structure, has short, dark hair and has blue eyes, most of the time we see him in the school uniform, during the story he demonstrates To be somebody serious and extremely intelligent, not to mention that it is very risky to say a little cold and calculating, but one time or another makes a joke, although he almost does not change his expression of the face to give the impression that he was serious. Tatsuya joined the Disciplinary Council at the request of the council chairman, due to the level of his knowledge and his exceptional vision, being able to read the activation of a spell quickly, find out what its nature is and also is able to neutralize it. Secretly he works as an agent for a national security agency, and so is the mysterious software engineer and CAD known as \"Taurus Silver.\" Tatsuya protects her sister at all costs, he is like a \"guardian\" for her.\\n\r\nMiyuki Shiba(\u53f8\u6ce2 \u6df1\u96ea)\\n\r\nMiyuki is the main female protagonist, Tatsuya's younger sister. She is a bit short compared to Tatsuya, she has long dark hair and blue eyes, she is recognized as the most beautiful by both the male and female characters as well, she shows in the anime a little shy, but it is worth mentioning that She certainly has loving feelings for her brother, and if it were not for the blood ties, they might have a love relationship. As for her abilities, in almost every battle she uses a very strong freezing spell that also manifests itself when she is irritated, Miyuki is the representative of the beginners and undoubtedly is a high class magician, is not atoa Which was for first year, and very quickly became part of the Student Council.\\n\r\nMayumi Saegusa(\u4e03\u8349 \u771f\u7531\u7f8e)\\n\r\nShe is the president of the first college student council, and in my opinion, the most beautiful character in the anime. She is friendly and approachable, especially with Tatsuya, after all, * I think she likes him. Most of the scenes she and Tatsuya are together, she asks if he does not get nervous about a girl as beautiful as she is.\\n\r\nErika Chiba(\u30a8\u30ea\u30ab\u5343\u8449)\\n\r\nErika is a student of Year 2 of Year 2. She is the youngest daughter of the Chiba Family, one of the families at the height of the Hundred Families. She is classmate of Shiba Tatsuya and not long after she became a constant friend and companion of the Shiba brothers. A good mage, and has a lot of experience with swords, which is something that has come from many generations of the Chiba family. Erika is a very fun character, extroverted, with a good sense of humor and almost always with the high astral high above, but of course when the matter is serious, she does not play.\\n\r\nLeonhart Saijou(\u897f\u57ce \u30ec\u30aa\u30f3\u30cf\u30eb\u30c8)\\n\r\nSaijou Leonhart is a student of First High School, a year 2 Course 2. He is also referred to as \"Leo\". He is the first male student who approached Shiba Tatsuya on the day of registration, and has since been his companion and friend. On the appearance and personality Leo possesses Germanic traits, brown hair, green eyes and an athletic body. He is also considered handsome and has met the interests of some girls. He has an easy personality and a brilliant disposition along with a straightforward and straightforward attitude that often leads him to heated discussions with Chiba Erika. He has an inhuman resistance, and uses a fortification spell most of the time. Leo is easily motivated or persuaded to do favors, I find him a very fun and strong character.\\n\r\nMizuki Shibata(\u6c34\u6728\u67f4\u7530)\\n\r\nMizuki and another classmate from Tatsuya of course 2, he met her along with Erika. Mizuki is described as a shy-looking girl who wears glasses. In their day, it is rare for girls to wear glasses because a vision correction procedure is already widespread. Tatsuya correctly inferred that their glasses were to reduce their over sensitivity to Pushion energy, allowing their \"crystal eyes\" to even perceive the hidden aura and the exact nature of the spirits. Regarding her personality, despite being a shy person, Mizuki is the person who loses patience with the rude actions of the students of Course 1, for example, during the first day of class, when a group tried to persuade Miyuki to join they. She provoked Morisaki Shun, the leader of the Bloom student group, which almost resulted in a \"magic battle\" between students, which is forbidden at school.\\n\r\nYoshida Mikihiko(\u5409\u7530\u5e79\u5f66)\\n\r\nHe is a direct and confused character, although he seems calm, he is also very shy when he is with mizuki. His magic is very important in reconnaissance missions by controlling spirits of various shapes and elements.\\n\r\n---THE PREJUDICE---\\n\r\nSpecifically in the first college there are two forbidden but widely used terms: BLOOMS and WEEDS. The Blooms have an extreme contempt for the Weeds for being in the second grade and being \"dumb\".\\n\r\n---Blooms---\\n\r\nThe Blooms are students of Course 1 of the first college, these were the ones who took good marks in both practical and theoretical exam. A detail of them is that in their uniform in the part of the chest and arm the symbol of the school is stamped.\\n\r\n---Weeds---\\n\r\nThe Weeds, in turn, are those who took bad or reasonable marks on any of the exams. Unlike the Blooms, the Weeds do not have the school symbol printed on their uniform. Tatsuya was the first student to score 100 on the theoretical examinations of the selection process for the first college, but he was recruited for Course 2, because his marks on the practical exam were very bad.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOne of my favorite anime styles is and always will be SCHOOL, so the anime pleased me right away. He also has great oppenings and good music. It is that typical anime that the protagonist is an appeal but no one knows, in the anime is implied that he is someone very important, I can not say who would not spoiler much, but I was kind of \"bugged\" because they did not explain it right. I really liked the anime, but I think it might be better if they split the fight pieces in the same proportion as the parties, the first part of the anime made it look like I was watching a school slice of life. The leisure parts and the championship that they participate are very cool, but I do not think that was the central idea of the anime. The anime itself is very good I liked it a lot because the anime showed a new idea, I always find it interesting anime like that, but the anime loses in the adaptation issue, that is, they adapted the parts more day by day and left the important events all pro final . The person who would probably be the villain of all anime having named name mentioned in several scenes does not appear much. As season 1 did not explain so much, I think it will be explained more in the film because I think the madhouse considered making the film as a 2nd season because it is cheaper, I'm not sure, but if that happened, it would be a shame Anime so good to end like this. With an original ending it might be cool, anime's do that a lot, especially the ones that did not sell well.\\n\\n\r\nPros\\n\\n\r\nDespite the strange idea (\"Technological Magic\"), the anime is very interesting, it has a good story, good fights, and cool characters, it holds you very close to watching you make you want more.\\n\\n\r\nCons\\n\\n\r\nThe end of the anime is very broken and without much explanation. The events are all in the last episode, leaving a great door for a 2nd season, as I said up there, I think they have adapted badly to light novel by showing almost nothing in the whole anime. But Mahouka's studio has just announced a movie about probably the latest bow released, which puts the chances of a new season down.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was very top also, in the fights, almost always is a music with electronic beats, I have no complaints to make about, because for min did not leave much to be desired. About opening and ending, I particularly enjoyed a lot, are very good, especially the ending 2 I enjoyed it too much.\\n\r\nOverall the anime gets a little lost leaving all the events to the end of the anime, leaving us who are watching a bit confused, but despite all this in my opinion and my taste was rather a great anime, even because I was not so lost So he accompanied the ramifications of the manga both the original and what tells the story of him as a child.",

And it never did.\r\nI listened to hours of explanations of magic, and watched countless scenes demonstrating the main character's power.  The whole time, I was optimistic that it had to be building to some kickass storyline where all the intricacies of the magical system come together in some sort of catastrophe.The main character's ridiculously hyped powers would finally not be enough, and the audience would be left in awe of this new challenge that can take down the great protagonist.

            "content": "tl;dr version/summary in the last paragraph.\r\nMahouka Koukou no Rettousei is an anime adaptation by studio Madhouse of a highly acclaimed light novel series of the same name. In honor of the upcoming movie and the fairly recent start of the publishing of official English translations of the light novels, I decided to write this review so that I might raise some awareness and maybe help someone discover this series that I greatly enjoyed.\r\nHowever, before I start with the review, there is one thing I must adress. There are plenty of people out there, that despise this show for a variety of reasons. If you despiseincestuous undertones, you should probably leave now, because they're very apparent in Mahouka. If you have an irrational hate of overpowered protagonists, this show is probably not for you either. That said, I think most people who hate this show for that reason have a serious case of hypocrisy, as the same people seem to love One Punch Man. If however, those things don't bother you, I urge you to read on as I explain just why I like Mahouka so much.\\n\\n\r\nThe story starts in year 2095. The world has been ravaged by famine and war, and the population of Earth is only a small portion of what it used to be. The only reason a nuclear apocalypse was avoided was due to discovery of the magic at the dawn of the millenium, and the solidarity of the world's magicians in eradicating nuclear weapons. After several decades of relative peace, our two main protagonists - siblings Tatsuya and Miyuki - are about to enter one of the prestigious magic high schools in Japan and trigger a course of events that will change the people, society and the world around them.\\n\\n\r\nI personally find the universe of Mahouka to be absolutely fascinating. The amount of thought and detail the original author has put into it blows my mind. While the anime does not let us fully appreciate all the detail, the visualization and the beautiful art by Madhouse is truly a fine replacement. Everythings from clothes (for the record, Mahouka has the coolest looking school uniforms ever period) to everyday utilities to buildings and infastructure looks absolutely amazing.\\n\\n\r\nMahouka's cast of characters is also very well done. The character designs are interesting, all the characters have plenty of backstory to them and they all have their unique way of being badass. Not to mention I absolutely love the character dynamics, and there's an abundance of potential ships for all the shippers out there. Despite having a massive cast of side characters, it handles them admirably.\\n\\n\r\nOn a side note - the Oreimo-Mahouka crossover memes are hilarious.\\n\\n\r\nSaying that the soundtrack of the anime is \"different\" from most anime is an understatement. The OST has music from a multitude of genres, and the music itself ranges from emotional to light hearted to epic. While I definitely enjoy the OST, and it definitely fits in, I feel that the composer tried too many different things, which makes it feel like something of a jumbled mess. Both of the two openings of the show get you hyped up, whilst the two serene endings let you peacefully lay in your chair while you think back to the episode. And although I might be somewhat biased on this matter since the show has a good deal of my favourite seiyuus (voice actors), I think the voice acting and casting is overall very well done.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself isn't anything that special. It's formatting is fairly generic for novels, where enemy \"X\" is trying to interfere with event \"Y\" and the protagonists must stop them by solving a mystery involved. But the sheer amount of content and depth put into it does fill the void somewhat.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the biggest downfall of Mahouka's anime adaptation: exposition. Since it's based on an extremely exposition heavy light novel series, it can be difficult job to translate all that into the dialogue. Without the existence of a proper narrator, plenty of things will be left unexplained. I found it particularly ridiculous how the anime failed the explain the abbreviation \"CAD\" (casting assistance device) which is probably the most single used item and second most used word (after \"Onii-sama\", which you will hear approximately every 3 minutes). If English is not your first language, you will probably struggle understanding what on earth is going on, when the characters start speaking in mostly scientific vocabulary.\\n\\n\r\nDuring my first time watching Mahouka, there were several times where it had to rewind the video, pause, carefully read a line and ponder it's meaning before I fully understood it. It's kind of like science class, except with magic. If you've read the light novels first and already know what's going on, this won't be a problem to you, since you're already familiar with the terminology and can focus on the beautiful visuals. But obviously, reading the novels shouldn't be a requirement for understanding the anime, and that's something the anime adaptation fails horribly at.\\n\\n\r\nAs everyone who knows anything about Madhouse can attest, they're really good at at making action scenes. Mahouka is most certainly not an exception to that. I can with full honestly say that it has some of the most stunning and badass fight scenes ever made. I distinctly recall the pain of my jaw dropping to the floor several times while watching this.\\n\\n\r\nTo summarise, Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei is a sci-fi, magic, action show based on a light novel series of the same name. The main character is a badass and completely overpowered. His sister is a massive brocon. The visuals are stunning and the fight scenes will make your jaw drop. The exposition is overall poorly done, and will leave you confused unless you've read the novels or are willing to rewind multiple times. There's a large and interesting cast of fleshed out characters with interesting pasts and numerous ideals. The character dynamics are awesome. The OST is a weird mix of numerous genres, but it does it's job well enough. Overall, I feel it's done very well, and every episode gave me an irresistible urge to watch the next one (I binge-watched the whole thing). I rate Mahouka as a solid 9/10.",

            "content": "I am baffled as to why this story is so popular. The best I can say about it is that it was \"fine, I guess, if you have 11 hours to waste in the least gratifying way possible.\"\r\nThe good\r\nThe world has a very complex magical system that the characters will tell you all about in an extremely boring, unhelpful way. But I guess it's consistant and thoroughly explained, so there's that. The art also wasn't terrible, however I have to say I found the use of 3D modeling a little jarring. It didn't fit in with the style of the art at all, and allI can chalk it up to was either laziness or lack of funding. It looked sloppy, clunky, and just...bad. Sorry, this was supposed to be \"the good\" section. Spoiler alert: the best thing about this is the art, and even that isn't very good.\\n\\n\r\nThe bad\\n\r\nI suppose the worst part about this is that there was never any suspense. It's very clear by episode 2 that Gary Stu Wonder Boy (aka Tatsuya) is going to get everything he wants without even having to work very hard. He makes a big show of \"not wanting to be in the spotlight\" at all ever, and yet somehow he always always always ends up not only involved, but right in the center of it all. There's an unfair discriminatory policy towards course 2 students? Well, now that Tatsuya is here, suddenly everyone is against that unfairness.  Secretly, the student council has been against it all along! There's an amazing CAD engineer who can make the impossible possible? Jeez, I WONDER who it could be???? What, our entire team got wiped out right before the finals of Generically Important Sports Competition?? But they don't usually allow replacements?? But this time they will??? And guess who it's going to be??? Tatsuya?!?! Whhaaaat?? Crazy. \\n\\n\r\nThis show is ridiculous, honestly. It was almost laughable in how predictable it was. The last arc was by far the worst. The MC is OP, yes. But honestly, he's not the only one. Let me summarize something that happened with not one character, but two (at least): \"Hey Dad. Yeah, we got caught up in a terrorist attack...again. Could you send over some helicopters? Sweet. thanks, Dad! You're the best!\" Seriously. That happened. TWICE. There's also this weird incestual overtone that is played for jokes...kind of. I really don't get why it was included. It added nothing to this story. Not to mention that OPMC gets a harem for...no reason in particular? He regularly expresses opinions that are unfeminist at best and misogynistic at worst. He never hesitates to tell a girl that what she is wearing is \"inappropriate\". Even one of his teachers! To be fair, the design of this particular teacher is pretty much \"talking boobs\". She, like all of the characters on this show, is given no character development.  This anime is set in 2095! Are gender problems still that bad??? How depressing. \\n\\n\r\nThe final nail in the coffin of this show is that there is literally no point. There's no overarching goal the MCs are trying to accomplish. No Big Bad to defeat. No internal struggle to overcome. The last episode heavily indicates that there's more to the story. So maybe there's a lot of context missing that the Light Novels go into. I'm not sure; I have literally no desire to spend any more time with this franchise.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want to watch a MUCH BETTER show about a clueless bodyguard high school aged soldier, go watch Full Metal Panic. Don't waste your time on this anime. Just...don't.",

            "content": "Mahouka...mahouka...mahouka, judging by the score you might I hate it, and you are partially right, but I don't hate the show as an entity by itself but more of what it stands for. And here is the thing, Mahouka is not an entity by itself, by itself it is merely an average gary-stu story, I have seen at least 50 similar works in surfing Qidian all of them pre-date Mahouka. But Mahouka gets the hate because it signalled an era, an era of utter putridness that is coming forth to swallow us whole, the era of horrible WN adaptations. (Well technically SAO takes part ofthe fall, but its effect is less than Mahouka's)\\n\\n\r\nStory - 2\\n\\n\r\nThe story gets 2 marks, 1 for actually trying to pretend it have one and 1 for all trying to explain things in techno bullshit. The thing is the entire story can be summed up in one phrase \"Tatsuya (self-insert name) is awesome!\" Yes that's it, Tatsuya is Jesus, and anything in his way shrivel pathetically in front of his almighty finger poke of doom. Politics? Setting? How do they matter at all when your MC is so OP, that nothing matters at all. There is no real stakes, no real conflict, all the politics, all the fancy explaining, they are all deception creating an illusion of depth.\\n\\n\r\nThe story like almost all these terrible WN adaptation is simply a masturbation power fantasy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 1\\n\\n\r\nMiyuki is an annoying mary-sue, created by the author to be the perfect waifu for him (You should read the part in the novel describing her, the author fanboying is very creepy). Beyond that she is nothing more than an extension of Tatsuya.\\n\\n\r\nWhich bring us to the halbringer of WN OP protagonist, Tatsuya. He is emotionless except he does have emotion, he is OP, a genius, and basically good at everything, and as for the \"feel other people pain\" part, that is totally bullshit, he have no reaction at all. Pain is shown, pain is when the MC fall to the ground screaming, looking pathetic, and showing your weakness, trembling unable to get up. Tatsuya have none of this, so \"Pain\" my ass.\\n\\n\r\nAs for other characters, when a black-hole-sue exist, all other character cease to have any purpose other than be insects for tatsuya to step on, or worshippers who kiss the very ground tatsuya walks on.\\n\\n\r\n--------Effect on the LN industry-------\\n\\n\r\nSee the word \"weakest\" in bahamut's title? The trend of \"MC-kun have is actually super-duper awesome and the school is flawed\" is popularized by Mahouka's success. But there is an even more terrifying result.\\n\\n\r\nMahouka's success had opened the flood gate that used to hold back the abominations of WN, but now the seal is cast off, and the WN tide now sweeps towards us. Things like GATE (Xenophobic propaganda power fantasy/Spunkgargleweewee), Overlord (standard Qidian power fantasy), and many not yet animated WN turned LN are flooding forward. It would be like the dark age of Qidian all over again, power fantasy running rampant, all challenge is lost until the medium is known as nothing but a putrid pond of masturbation. Now the LN industry is pretty much dead with half of what it output being \"pretty pictures and toilet paper\" with the other half being \"Power Fantasy Masturbation\"\\n\\n\r\nDo you see the problem of this kind of shows now?\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 1.5\\n\\n\r\nLike I said, Mahouka by itself is not too much of an abomination (it still is), by it self it probably deserves a 3 or 3.5, but the result it caused is catastrophic, and due to the horrible personality of its author, the entire thing deserves a 1.5 out of 10.",

The colours used are bland, and Tatsuya Shiba is essentially a one-man army dealing with the threats for an entire school. There's also those weird moments approaching incest with Miyuki, something I feel should have been left out.\r\nHowever, for all its shortcomings, the battle scenes are glorious and exploring Tatsuya's psyche and lack of magical powers is in-depth. The animation style makes theuniforms seem sharp, a selling point for the anime with otherwise boring animation choices. Repetitive music, but used to great effect.\\n\\n\r\nOverall good impression, but with a few things to work on for the next season.",

            "content": "This show won't contain spoilers, but will gloss over some of the story arcs.\r\nI see a lot of hatred for this show, and while I am not surprised, I am a bit saddened. I wrote a review for this show back when it was in ep 16, and have since completed the entire show at least 4 separate times; the only other show that I've seen so much of was Code Geass.\r\nI would like to start with the biggest complaint that everyone seems to have with this show: the main character, Shiba Tatsuya. While this anime most certainly seems to be your run-of-the-mill show featuringmagic and highschools, you'd be wrong to believe that you'll find here what you've found in countless other shows. Having now seen my fair share of anime, I know that your average MC is usually someone who doesn't know much about what's going on, is somewhat clumsy, is extremely squeamish and often times find himself following other people's plans, even if s/he has doubts about it, and is extremely powerful. \\n\\n\r\nHaving said this, a few of the readers may think of a few shows that do not do this; personally, Code Geass and Death Note (two of my personal favorite shows) come to mind. In my previous review, I compared the MC from Code Geass and from Death Note to the one portrayed in this show, which upset a lot of people. The truth is, all of these characters are pretty much the opposite of what I just described as being the average MC, aside from power. It would seem we can't have a show where the less powerful defeat the more powerful without becoming more powerful themselves.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOne of the most astonishing things about Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei is the pacing. It's slow; very, very slow. I was initially thrown off by how slow it was, and held it against the show; however, as it progressed, I started to realize how great it was that it was taking its time. Truth is, this anime does more than tell a story; it paints a complete picture of how magic works, why it works, practical applications, the effect that power and the lack thereof has on people, has reasonably extensive background stories for nearly all of the secondary characters. If you simply want a fast-paced action show, run away as far as you can from this one.\\n\r\nTruth be told, the way this show likes to detail how everything fits together reminds me of Tolkien's works with Middle Earth, and that is not a comparison I will do easily.\\n\\n\r\nThe one thing that I truly dislike and that feels the most out of place with this show is the extremely strong brother complex that goes on between Tatsuya and Miyuki. I understand that the sister has to like her brother (for that one thing that happens later on in the show to happen), but this is just overkill.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI'm not good with art. I like the simplistic, clean look of the characters and the environments, even if they can feel a bit lacking at times.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI usually don't really care about sound. I just don't notice it for the most part; however, Code Break has joined my music library as one of the very few songs that I have bothered to get from anime. I really enjoy the mix of drums, whistles, vocals and dubstep. It really added quite to the few battles in the show.\\n\\n\r\nI did, however, deduct 1 point for the weird violinish songs played during brother complex segments. Just no.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI mentioned characters in the preface. I would say that MC does not change throughout the show, as this show is primarily about revealing who he is and what he can truly do. However, all other character significantly evolve around the MC, which is made possible through the slow nature of this show. It's quite interesting to see the change of mentality and how people change their opinion of Tatsuya throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nTruth is that I really wish all MCs could be like this. I have no personal interest in shows where the MC is \"clumsy, fiery and lovable\". However, opinions are like assholes; everyone has one. I just happen to enjoy cold, calculating MCs that rely on their intelligence rather than their \"guts\" to complete challenges.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI can count the amount of anime shows I've seen a second time in one hand. I'll even list them: No Game No Life (4x), Code Geass (4x), Death Note (2x), Highschool of the Dead (2x) Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei (4x). Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei is one of the few anime shows out there that encourages the viewer to actually think about what they're viewing. This is a show that is best viewed while thinking about what's being presented to you. If I had to find the exact opposite viewing experience, I would say Gurren Lagann; a show good in its own right, just as long as you don't think about it and just enjoy the spectacle of robots larger than galaxies throwing, well, galaxies at each other.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI actively search for shows similar to this one quite often. Not many exist, and often times they can be quite buried down in their rank, as they're not necessarily the most popular types of story. This is most certainly a good acquisition as the 5th show I give a rating of 10/10. I really hope that there will be a second season.",

            "content": "To start, I have NOT read the manga. That said, I wouldn't know if this is a great chapter-by-chapter adaptation or not. \r\nTatsuya (mmc) is a refreshing look at a shounen lead. He is neither weak, OP. He has his flaws, yet is a dominating force that can be admired. The same cannot be said for other characters. Many characters are sterotypical. You've got the overly shy (Azusa Nakajou), the moe glasses type (Mizuki Shibata), the silent \"android\" type (Shizuku Kitayama), as well as many other tried and tested anime tropes. In fact, there are so MANY characters introduced, that even in 26 episodes moreoften than not, character development is lacking.\\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, the story is rather erratic at times. I did like the division of the series into arcs, and I enjoyed the story overall, but significant details were either glossed over or left out completely. We get a glimpse of Tatsuya's background, but that's all. I would have liked a little more explanation on what exactly was done to him, how rare he is, and a deeper look into his relationship with his \"sister\" Miyuki and the non-existent relationship he has with their family. Again, a 12 episode one-shot series, I couldn't expect much. But I expect a little more cohesiveness and development from a 26 episode adventure. \\n\\n\r\nThe basis of the story is interesting: Magicians developed as weapons. Seeing this power grow and how it could be abused made me excited to see more. The series also took a more scientific approach with the presence of magic through CAD's (which were never fully explained either). \\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's not a bad series. I would hesitate to settle in for 26 episodes if you're on the fence about this one. I can't imagine there are not better options out there. But on concept alone it's a win for me. Execution makes it average.\\n\\n\r\nIf this series gets greenlit for another season, I hope there is more explanations and deeper character developments, and not just the fan service kind.",

            "content": "Mahouka is not a story about an underdog struggling to break social stigmas and stereotypes, nor is it a show about whatever else it tried to be about. It's a show about the man, the hero, the legend, the universe - the brilliant Onii-sama.\r\n=Writing & Directing\r\nIt's straight up shit. Even though I overall enjoyed the show it's not really good in any regard but its way of being bad can be really amusing. The story itself can be divided into a few acrs each loosely connected around the same theme of how magic affects the world of mahouka: be it discrimination based on ability, technologicalprogress or military resource. None of that really matters cause in the end there's little in terms of exploration or resolution to any of that. The only thing that matters is that awe inspiring Onii-sama is amazing and nothing can be done to stop him.\\n\r\nThe show gets a bit more boring after Nine Schools Competition arc cause more focus is put onto side characters and plotting evil organisations but action also steps up a notch so I guess it's fine.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to characters it's about as mediocre as every anime out there, most of them can be adequately summed up with just one word that described the way they feel or act majority of the time, some are permamad, some are always halfway to orgasm and so on. The spotlight of course is magnificent Onii-sama who apparently can't feel a damn thing other than hatred for anyone who dares hurt his sister. It would be a huge downside in every other series but seeing him knock every asshole or a confident prick down a peg is so satisfying that it's probably the sole reason I watched the show. The thing is, at first virtually every other character hates the great Onii-sama simply because magical test and class systems in his school are kind of dumb, so despite being a prodigy when it comes to engineering and theoretical knowledge of magic, amazing Onii-sama is considered a second class citizen cause his practical use of magic is nowhere near good. His otherwise otherworldly skills are the reason why people say there's no tension in this show, there isn't because it's not a question of whether fantastic Onii-sama will win or lose, it's a question of who will he destroy today.\\n\\n\r\nAnother part of writing that's important to note is the sheer amount of unstoppable exposition and technobabble, it's gonna take a simple thing like blasting someone with magic really hard and then try really hard to present it as complicated techno-magic science which sometimes makes glorious Onii-sama's victories all the more amusing.\\n\\n\r\nDon't have any complaints when it comes to directing, it doesn't stand out but it's still competent when it came to pacing and delivery on exposition dumps. I've seen better shows that were harder to get through due to above being badly done.\\n\\n\r\n=Art & Sound\\n\\n\r\nWhile the designs for almost everything are bland, the color coordination, use of digital effects, filters and overall consistency are fairly decent and animation quality is good when it needs to be. As for sound the music while not great still did a decent job of setting the mood and feel for some scenes. There were some questionable things like constant autotuned vocals with occasionally jarring engrish or one comedy track that had rasta influences but otherwise there's some good variety to it and it doesn't feel like one of those cheap OSTs made by an doujinshi circle of amateur artists whose specialty are tracks so bland you would never be able to tell who made them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it's a really shit anime but it's kind of shit that's fun to look at in the right mood.",

I see Mahouka as a one huge preview that is supposed to get you pumped for the anime to come and that's where it shines. It just presents you with a plot, tells you all the basic stuff you'd want to know about the anime before watching it and then it's just done.\r\nStory:3\r\nTatsuya and bunch of other guys from his school, but mainly Tatsuya, fight the bad guys. Don't expect serious plot and mind-crushing plottwists, for it's pretty straight forward.\\n\r\nArt:7\\n\r\nLooks good.\\n\r\nSound:5\\n\r\nThere were about 3 or 4 instances that I actually registered any soundtrack what so ever. The only reason why it gets 5 there is because it was pretty cool in those instances and because there was no point where i thought the sounds were bad.\\n\r\nCharacter:1\\n\r\nTypical. Anime. Characters. From bottom. To the top. Although to the end there is something slightly visible that could represent some form of character development.\\n\r\nEnjoyment:10\\n\r\nMade my point at the start.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:1///10\\n\r\nAwfully bad anime. Hell of a good preview. I honestly hope it gets a sequel and it lives up to my expectations, because if it does.. Oh boy.",

            "content": "So first off I'm watching anime for about half a year now and on one destined day I stumbled across this Masterpiece of an anime with, at least practically, two different plots, which both take about one half of the whole season. Actually I' don't even know how I learned about this anime anymore, but whatever, I'm definitely glad I did. \r\nSo now to the anime.\r\nThe story takes place in the year 2095 after a World War and is about the protagonist Shiba Tatsuya, who enrolls at a Highschool for Magicians together with his Sister. At first everyone thinks he stands in the shadow ofhis sister,which is but in reality he is a genius with prodigious history, who is sworn to secrecy about it. From time to time his fellow students realise that he is more than they seemed to notice at first. And he uses this fact to his advantage to weaken the discrimination between the higher and lower class students in that school. He established himself not only as a genius magical engineer, but also as a magician with astonishing physical and magical abilities. \\n\r\nThat said, it's hard to deny that he is probably one of the strongest and most overpowered characters I've ever seen in an anime but he has a rather great flaw since he has nearly no emotions. But even this is one more fact I like this anime since he has such an unclouded mind and analyses everything with a cool head. That doesn't mean that he is a totally irrational douche with no understanding for feelings an emotions.\\n\r\nAnd so to sum it up, it's really an anime I would recommend to everyone, even if it really starts to roll at the 5th episode but if one can overcome that you are sure to be rewarded, believe me :D",

            "content": "Mahouka 8/10 - is very good, but has a big flaw\r\n---------------SPOILER FREE-------------------\r\nGreat Anime, a mix of action and comedy/romance. It has a great story split into 2 arcs of seperate \"incidents\".\r\nSet in a High school where students are split into 2 courses it deals with the issues of discrimination mainly until a certain point.\r\nThe big flaw with this anime is the main protagonist. He's a really ridiculus character, which makes things kinda stupid.\r\nThe things that differ from this world, that make magic possible are really irritating me, since they introduce facts that are\r\neither wrong to current understanding or just don't fit into this worlds rulesvery well, which are then used in Mahouka nontheless.\\n\r\nIts like someone saying:\" Hey, here 8/9 is 1, but all other Math laws apply\", which is NOT POSSIBLE, but with programming things.\\n\r\nI'm not saying thats \"bad\" or something that shouldn't be done, but its very irritating to someone of knowledge.\\n\r\nThe first arc is great. It introduces the viewer to the mechanics that are present and talks about real problems, that we have too.\\n\r\nThe storyline is really interesting and has a good way of hiding the way the arc is going to play out, which is really good.\\n\r\nCharacters introduced here are well done and carry a meaning in existing, altho Mahouka has a few filler characters.\\n\r\nThe ending of the first arc is well done and has no cliffhanger whatsoever, so I recommend stopping here. Just stop after the \"last dance\".\\n\r\nOverall the second arc is good, but it feels really rushed towards the end. The arc is set up well at the start, but the setup is so big,\\n\r\nthat it cannot really finish everything of in the last episodes. In this arc the unexplained/crazy stuff happens.\\n\r\nIt feels like someone said:\"WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH ACTION\" and they just filled episodes with fights that are pointless to show.\\n\r\nI also feel like the setup of the arc overhypes whats going to happen.\\n\r\nStill, it doesn't break character or the worlds setup so I hope they make a followup to this arc.\\n\r\nAll in all, a great storydriven anime, really no big logic loopholes and interesting concepts of magic.\\n\r\nI enjoyed it and would recommend it.",

            "content": "A story, weaved through paper or computer, is supposed to incorporate elements that are common to a plot, such as rising action, climax, and falling action. These stages of plot development are usually driven along by either character development or action sequences, all with an end goal in mind. In SAO, it was to get out of Aincrad alive. In Love Live, it was to participate and ultimately win Love Live. In Pokemon, it was to become the very best, like no one ever was. However, Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei, else known as The Irregular at Magic High School, defies these common standards. It isa story that does not focus on its action sequences too acutely, for the main protagonist is too overpowered to serve as an equal opponent to anymore. Since the main protagonist is overpowered and literally emotionally dead, character development also is negated. So what happens in this show? Something extraordinary, in the fact that the plot is guided along, not by characters, not by action, but by the pure virtue of the plot itself. Here is a show that does not adhere to normal story-telling procedures, and instead forges its own path, using anything other than the protagonist to drive the story. The protagonist is not just the main hero of the story anymore, but rather a kind of savior known only in fantasy.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\r\nThe story isn't terribly original, but it is wonderfully executed overall. However, the interesting thing to bring the score up so high is that it seems as if the show starts out at the middle of the story. The beginning is not explained, but rather revealed in hints and snippets through the entirety of the series. The background of the siblings is hinted at at moments, along with their precarious relationship, but is not fully expounded upon. This sort of tantalizing gesture would normally cause a score to go down, but the story arcs themselves are so interesting and engrossing that it is truly hard to drop the show. From the beginning of the school year to the summer break tournaments, The Irregular makes the plot interesting with a constant state of tension, relieving the stress occasionally with good comedic moments that make the plot feel relaxed and fresh. The story hides the tension easily, concealing under a slice-of-life type of setting. It is a wonderfully crafted story that trumps the holes left by a mysterious backstory of the sibling protagonists.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound:\\n\r\nMadhouse truly put full efforts in the animation of this show, as every combat scene, every slow-motion effect, even the cafe sit downs, look excellent, with the proper lighting and excellent shading in every single aspect. The semi-3D effects, the spell circles, the character outfit designs, all of it are excellently planned out and animated. The sound within the show is very good as well, and the two openings are catchy and upbeat, while retaining that high-energy feeling the show emanates. The last ending, however, deserves to be praised for its sound. Rei Yasuda does an excellent job on \"Mirror\", and it nicely closes off the last few episodes with a strong sound.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nAlthough I did previously say that the story is not character-driven, that is the exact reason why I gave this section a solid 10/10. How can a character that is already fully developed, with a complete backstory and locked in with his emotional state, develop even further? Simple, he can't. I'm sure there's arguments that could argue that the sister could've changed through the show, but the sister's own feelings and unchangeable, and thus making the main characters change would be untrue to the plot itself. If the main characters don't change, then the side characters pick up the slack slightly. Though I won't mention specific characters, in the end, the side characters do develop nicely from the beginning to the end of the show. However, this development does not make a difference in the plot overall, as the main protagonist siblings completely overshadow them in power. This unchanging nature of the characters is what deems this section a 10, because the directors realized that changing the characters would not be staying true to the plot, and thus the 10 is to symbolize the characters' true worth as unchanging stone characters that can defeat anything that comes their way.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nThe show had its funny moments, exciting moments, its tense moments, and its angry moments. The show is a rollercoaster, but it doesn't feel too fast or too slow at any given point.\\n\\n\r\nThe Irregular at Magic High School does not fit within the normal stock of plot and conflict, in the essence that the conflict, which should contribute to rising action and ultimately the climax, does not result in anything at all due to the sheer power of the protagonists. It is a show which does nothing and yet everything within its plot. It is a show of two separate dynamics; of both change within its side characters, and stagnation within its main characters. This combination of two seemingly opposite tropes makes this show an utter masterpiece that manages to make two opposite themes attract. If you're searching for a series that does not rely on its protagonists and instead focuses on the setting and the story more, look no further, and have no fear, for all will be solved by power in the end.\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10",

            "content": "OVERALL - 8/10\r\nIf you are new to anime, have been living under a rock for a few years, or just awoke from cryogenic slumber, you may not have heard about The Irregular at Magic High School. If you have heard of it, but haven't watched it yet, I don't know what you are waiting for. There are many reasons why you should watch this anime, and I will go through some of my favorite reasons why you need to watch:\r\n1. Packed to the brim with Onii-sama - This anime has more \"Onii-sama\" than any other series, and most of them combined. Research done while boredhas proven there to be 172 seperate utterances of \"Onii-sama\" packed into 26 episodes. Thats over 6.5 \"Onii-sama\" per 24 minute serving!\\n\\n\r\n2. The most ridiculously OP MC in history - Yes that's right, Tatsuya is the bastard love child between Saitama (One Punch Man) and Hermoine Granger (Harry Potter). He can do anything when it comes to the magic system used in the story. While I am sometimes bothered by overpowered protagonists, because he is so far over the top I found it more entertaining than grating or annoying.\\\\n\\n\r\n3. Its Madhouse - Madhouse is not known for producing poorly animated shows, so its no surprise that The Irregular at Magic High School is a beautifully drawn and animated show. \\n\\n\r\nTL;DR - In short, come for the \"onii-sama\" but stay for the animation. This may not be the most innovative or unique story out there, but for what it is (AKA Magic School Battle story) it is a type specimen and a ruler to judge other Magic school batlle anime against.",

            "content": "When I First Heard Mahouka Koukou No Rettousei I Didn't Took It Seriously Until The  Itself Got Surprisingly High Rating At The Time Of Its Finish. So When I Watched The  I Fairly Enjoyed It Like I Watching SAO Or Rakudai Kishi No Cavalry But With Different Style Of Uniqueness. \r\nSince This  Is Adaptation Of LN I Wouldn't Compared It In Light Novel Point Of View. This Is My  Point Of View:\r\nThe Story ? Well, I Found It PRETTY GOOD\r\n*Well, The Story Centered In Two Protagonist Enrolling Same Magic School But With Very Different Degree Due To Entrance Results. At First,I Found This Nothing Unique But As The Story Progressed I Realized There's More Complex Story Than Just Ordinary Lives Story Of Protagonist And I Pretty FASCINATED And CURIOUS About It.\\n\\n\r\n*The Plot Pace However Can Make Some People Bored Because It's Pretty Damn SLOW But It's Okay For Me Because They MAKE UP For It In The Awesomeness Of Action Combat Scene And Brilliant Strategic Thinking Scene. History, The Governments, Magics, Socials, And Politics Were Explained In Great Detail Making Me Even More EXCITED With The World In Mahouka Koukou No Rettousei. \\n\\n\r\nThe Art ? I Think It Is EXCELLENT\\n\r\nMadhouse Has Done It Perfectly. The Animation Was EXCELLENT, The Movement Was Pretty AWESOME In Action Combat Scenes, The BG Was Also NICE. I Found The Character Design Was Pretty GOOD Too, They Designed It Not Too Excessive Or Not Too Bland. The School Uniform Was Also Pretty COOL Too.\\n\\n\r\nThe Sound ? Hmm.... Well I Think I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH IT.\\n\r\nThe 1st And 2nd OP/ED Was NOT TOO BAD I Think And I Have No Problems With It (Even Though I Often Skipped It Both For Saving Time) The OST Is Also Pretty GOOD But Not Particularly SPECIAL For Me. \\n\\n\r\nThe Character ? I Think It's GREAT\\n\r\n*If You Know Kirito From SAO I Cannot Deny It That Shiba Tatsuya Has SAME Characteristic In Terms Of Overpowering Power As Kirito Did. But While Kirito Is Freeloader Type Personality Tatsuya Are Cool And Genius Type Personality. Some People May Brand Tatsuya As Siscon Type Since Tatsuya And His Sister Miyuki Has Harboring Love To Each Other More Than Anyone Else. I Think Tatsuya Is GREAT Character. He May Make You Confused At First Due To Complex Personality But Almost All His Action Was To Protect His Beloved Sister. \\n\\n\r\n*Then We Have His Sister Shiba Miyuki. She Is Intelligent, Capable, Beautiful, And Sometimes Pretty Moe. She Always Very Obsessed With His Brother Tatsuya And Even Her Friends Calling It Lovey-Dovey Relationship Rather Than Familial Sibling Relationship. I Very Enjoyed It Watching Their Relationship. She Also Sometimes Jealous If She Seen Her Brother Dating, Charming, Or Blushing With Another Girls And I Found It Pretty Hilarious To Watch. While Some People Thinks Miyuki Is Pretty Annoying Or Bothersome But In My View Miyuki Pretty INTERESTING. \\n\\n\r\n*The Supporting Characters Are Also Making Me INTERESTED About Them. Supporting Character Pretty Big Almost Equaling Shirobako's Side Charcters. \\n\r\nHowever, There Is One Supporting Character That Make Almost Have SAME STANDING As Main Character It's Name Is Mayumi Saegusa. She's The Only Person That I Very Remember The Most Due To Her Capability To Trolling Tatsuya To The Same Caliber He Troll Others And Her Affection Towards Tatsuya.\\n\\n\r\n*While Mahouka Koukou No Rettousei Triumphs In Dodging The Cliche's Or Confusing Situation Unfortunately It FALL SHORT Of Expectation In Supporting Character Development. If Supporting Character Development And Plot Was Very Good Mahouka Koukou No Rettousei May Will Be In Top 5  In Spring 2014\\n\\n\r\nThe Enjoyment ? I ENJOYED IT VERY MUCH \\n\r\nAlthough At The Time I'm Hyped About Another MadHouse Project  No Game No Life Which Released At The Same Time. But I Didn't Regret It Nor I Hate It , In Fact I Was Very Grateful The Decision To Watch Mahouka Koukou No Rettousei Proved To Be CORRECT One. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Mahouka Koukou No Rettousei Is Very Good . Pretty Satisfying And Very Enjoying To Watch",

            "content": "Mahouka, despite what it may appear, it isn't an action show, and it isn't really a harem or even romance show. What it is, rather, is a Science Fiction show that just happens to contain some anime cliches and stereotypes, for better and for worse. Mahouka is very centered on world-building and introducing it's viewers to the ins and outs of it's setting, as well as creating a plot that centers very heavily on said world-building.\r\nStory(8) - Mahouka introduces us to a world where magic has been slowly gaining prominence, and is on the cusp of changing the political and technological landscape of the planet.Mahouka starts off with Tatsuya Shiba, the protagonist of the show, arriving at First High, one of several academies that are dedicated to the advancement and study of magic. Magicians are ranked according to their proficiency in casting spells as well as their ability to influence \"Psions\", particles that are the catalyst of Magic. While Tatsuya is ranked as one of the lower class students, various events bring him to the attention of the student council, who quickly realize that while he may have been ranked low on the tests, Tatsuya's practical and real-world application of magic far outstrips any of his other classmates, and he is inducted as a member of the discipline enforcement branch, to show off his inner kirito to all the other helpless non-main characters in the story.\\n\\n\r\nWell it's easy to see where the anime influence shows itself, but right around here is where the show starts to get interesting (also i will be refraining from mentioning any further specific story points, can;t have too many spoilers)\\n\\n\r\nAt this point the show starts to really shine in my eyes, as it starts to focus on the interactions of magicians, and the work said magicians do. In a nutshell, the first arc covers the politics of First High, the Second Arc Covers the interplay between the academies, and the third arc focuses on the use of magicians in conflict between countries. Mahouka is at it's best when you can sit down and marathon and entire arc(typically 7-8 episodes) in one go. The story doesn't hold up very well when watched piece mental, as some episodes can be nothing but exposition, while some episodes can be entirely devoted to conflict. Either way, the story holds together quite nicely, and escalates at just the right pace, giving you time to adjust to the new scope of action.\\n\\n\r\nArt(8) - The animation in Mahouka is what you would expect of an anime coming out in 2014, the visuals and characters all look anime, and there is never really a drop in quality at any point in the story (Even the CGI is implemented responsibly, something that is often hit-or-miss in shows). The artistic design team did an excellent job, the cities and outfits all have an interesting blend of modern style and architecture pushed through a futuristic filter. The magic spells are a great treat to watch, the smoothly implemented special effects make the spells appear both menacing and otherworldly.\\n\\n\r\nSound(9) - The music of Mahouka fits the theme of the show perfectly, with varied techno, dubstep and otherwise \"current\" music trends. While I normally wouldn't think of a \"wub wub\" kind of mix fitting this anime, it surprisingly does the job, and actually gets you pumped up in the action scenes. The sound effects are both visceral and well designed, with very little stock sound effects thrown in, most if not all of the design seems to have been originally created for the show. If you have headphones or a decent surround sound, definitely use those.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (6) - The characters of Mahouka are for the most part quite likable, and despite the sheer number of supporting cast, each person has their own distinguishing feature to help set them apart. While the show doesn't make time to explain the backstory of nearly anyone, it doesn't really detract from the interactions they have with one another, leading to varied and enjoyable dialogue. Since they are the main focus of the show, i'll do a quick analysis of the lead protagonists.\\n\r\nTatsuya- The protagonist of Mahouka, Tatsuya is a reserved young man with ties to one of the most powerful magician families who is trying to strike out on his own. While Tatsuya may initially appear to be the completely overpowered hero who can do no wrong, we quickly realize that if your job name is \"magician\" your so far above normal humans that Tatsuya no longer appears to be the god he initially seems to be. Part of this is how the show goes in depth to the mechanics of how magic works, and how Tatsuya approaches Magic. The further into the show we go, the more Tatsuya appears to be a person who has achieved such strength through equal parts natural talent and hard work. This makes all the difference between a character who is insanely strong for plot convenience, and a character who actually deserves to kick so much ass his foot smells permanently of farts.\\n\r\nMiyuki- Now on to the reason characters received a 6. Miyuki is Tatsuya's doting sister and...thats it really. Her character is so unbelievably devoid of, well, character. Her sole purpose is to say \"onii-sama\" every chance she gets, and to generally be a bitch. Matters are not helped by the fact that she is the overpowered for no reason archetype, and we aren;t ever given any explanation for why she is so absurdly strong. Her annoyance is further compounded by the fact that she figures prominently in every arc, so we are never really given a chance to forget her.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8) - Despite Miyuki dragging down the show, as well as some very uneven pacing in the episode by episode info dumps, Mahouka is easily one of my favorite Sci-Fi shows to come out in awhile(Live action included, not just limited to anime). The mechanics of the Mahouka's world are genuinely entertaining and interesting to watch, and excellent production values just make the ride even more enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nIn closing, if you are looking for a heavy-duty science fiction show, I would highly recommend Mahouka. If you aren't into sci-fi, or are looking for just some mindless action fun, DO NOT assume this show has these characteristics. Scientific exposition and even some political intrigue are the main courses of Mahouka, while action is just a delicious side-dish.",

Every little detail had to be explained. Something would happen for a minute and then the rest of the episode would be characters hashing out why it happened the way it did. If this style is what you enjoy, then this anime is right up your alley.\r\nThe concept of magic was interesting and the story had potential, but it was too slow and fell flat in its delivery.Just my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nYou might enjoy this if: You like to hear technical explanations of how and why everything happens.\\n\\n\r\nYou might not like it if: The strange brother/sister love scene that occurs on occasion in anime bothers you.\\n\\n\r\nNote to the Viewer: This anime takes all the sexiness out of magic.\\n\\n\r\nEXPANDED REVIEW:\\n\\n\r\nOur anime group, Salt Lake City (SLC) Anime, reviewed The Irregular at Magic High School this month and here is what the group thought:\\n\\n\r\nThe group was split on what I mentioned earlier about the pace of the show. Some people enjoyed the slow, explanatory pace while others did not. Some people were bothered by the brother/sister love situation while others were not. Some people thought the character development and interaction left something to be desired. There were some that really enjoyed the connection of magic and technology combined with how everything was explained in great detail. One person mentioned that they really appreciated how the anime would give you some detail and then leave the viewer with a lot more to think about. Overall, people either loved or hated The Irregular at Magic High School.",

            "content": "I've always hated the fact that magic does not exist. Yet, I believe that technology will advance so much one day that we will be able to call it magic. And imagine this now, just ten days ago I came across an anime that kinda pictures that \"Techno-magic\" I was thinking about. I'll let you now enjoy the review on \"An Irregular at Magic High School\". \r\n Plot and Story Line \r\nYou remember maybe how Sword Art Online did that story-line thing, where the whole plot is actually made up of shorter stories (SAO, ALO, GGO...). Well, you have the same situation in AIAMHS too.They tell one shorter story in about eight episodes, and three or four such stories made the show. But what is this anime about now?\\n\r\nAs I mentioned in the beginning, magic is not magic how it used to be. Instead of colorful spells, bright lights, stars, cepters etc, you have codes. One code, one spell and they are all casted by Casting Assistant Devices, or in short CADs. The CADs are all designed and made by magic-engineers. One of those, and very talented one, is our protagonist Shiba, Tatsuya. Still, most of society knows him as just Tatsuya, a first-grade student at First MAgic High School. Because of his \"bad test results\" Tatsuya made it only into the second course, while his sister Miyuki attends the first course lessons. That's basically it about the plot. The short stories now are mostly result of governmental affairs,  competitions, and teenage problems. Talking about teenage problems, I kinda got used to first-degree-cousin-relationships in anime, bit this went to far. This could have been the best sibling-relationship ever, but no. Let's make a romance of it. I mean that looks just ridiculous. That's the first problem I have with this anime, but it can be overseen somehow. The second problem is way bigger. It's not a huge, it's an enormous plot hole. What or who is Tatsuya, who is his aunt, what happened to his mother, why is his family acting like this? This anime leaves all these questions open, just like that. However, I liked this anime enough to believe that this is not the end. I think, or more hope, that there will be a second season that will answer all the questions I have.  But despite all that, this anime still has a point that blends out the cons at least for a little bit. One word. ACTION! This anime has one of the best action I've ever seen. The fights were just epic, with so many different powers and bad-ass characters. I was amazed. Both thumbs up for that. that was also the most interesting thing about this anime. \\n\r\nMy first thought about this show was \"Techno-Magic, really?\". I mean it kinda humiliates the good-old magic we all know. However, it was interesting and fresh. Something new. It proved that there are still some makers that don't lack in ingenuity. Who would have ever thought that sci-fi and magic could be combined in this way. \"The Irregular at Magic High School\" (If only they had a better title).\\n\r\nCharacters \\n\r\nNow we come to problem three in this anime. The characters. The personalities are basically are the same, there is not a single character development and no uniqueness at all. There are maybe four or five characters that stood out a little bit like Erika, Sayaka and Misaki, and of course the main Tatsuya. But that's it. Still, as always I'll introduce you to the two mains. Tatsuya and Miyuki.\\n\\n\r\nSHIBA TATSUYA. Dear makers, was it possible to make Tatsuya even better? I think not. He was perfect, and I hate perfect character. He is strong, unbeatable, good-looking, smart, charismatic, should I continue? He was invincible. Although it was awesome to see him fight, his personality was boring. Also it was impossible for him to develop his character. I didn't like him.\\n\\n\r\nSHIBA MIYUKA. This is probably the most anoying character I've ever seen. She is cute and everything, but sooooo annoying. Still I have to say that she is a caring, talented and hard-working girl. She is also kind of that perfect characters that everybody adores. One of the cutest scenes in the anime is when Masaki, from Third Magic High School, askes her to dance with him. Kawaii. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Style\\n\r\nThis is one of the pros of this show. The animation is just perfect. I really enjoyed watching it. It shone the most in the action scenes. The way the spells were casted was so amusing. I loved it. When it comes to the style, it's probably nothing special. Just standard character looks, landscapes and backgrounds. On the whole it was good, no objections here. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\r\nWell, well, well. An Irregular at Magic High School was a good anime. It is not a waste of time, but there are more better anime worth wasting your time on. It is amusing, interesting and catchy. The thing that made me like this anime is probably the fact that it reminded me on my school and system. My school also has some kind of first and second course, and competitions with our \"Sister-Schools\". Try this anime I hope you will like it more than I did.  \\n\r\nYour AnimeGirl",

            "content": "Now, this anime does have flaws. But why is this ranked THIS LOW? It has flaws, but not enough to put this anime this low. I thoroughly enjoyed this anime. There is a good story, good characters, good visuals and mediocre to good sound. Yet for some reason it is said to be a bad anime by a lot of people. Obviously this isn't the majority, as this anime would have an even worse score that it already does. But it truly baffles me that an anime, by MadHouse, that has a good plot as this, and great assets like good art and sound, couldbe ranked and rated this lowly. \\n\\n\r\nStory 9/10\\n\r\nThis anime is the kind where the main character is seemingly powerless against the rest of the school, but is revealed that he is actually really powerful. This anime does this type of story pretty well, for a light novel, as there are a ton of light novel animes that are really bad.\\n\r\nI also thought that the idea for CADs was a really cool concept not seen in much anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\nThe artwork is beautiful. The magic., to the special effects, it adds to the fact that magic really isn't magic in this world, which is a concept I really liked.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\r\nThere wasn't anything that good in this department, but nonetheless I liked it as a mood indicator, as most songs fit their parts. Nothing great though.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 7/10\\n\r\nThis is the worst part of the anime. One of my least favorite kind of characters are the ones that love their siblings, especially if that sibling is the main character. This is why I absolutely HATE characters like Leafa/Sugu in SAO and Shizuku in Chivalry. It makes me cringe every time I see a fanservice or intimate moment between sister and brother.And that's EXACTLY Myuuki is. Hate it so much. Like the rest of the cast.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\r\nThis anime was fun to watch, but Myuuki put a damper on my enjoyment. I like everything about her except the fact that she's smitten for her brother. My favorite character, who was the most entertaining to see, was (call me weird) is the main character. I like seeing how characters like him adapt to his changing surroundings, like Haciman/8man from SNAFU and Houtarou from Hyouka. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\r\nThis anime was a blast to watch. Though I hated Myuuki, the rest was fine, and I liked it a lot. This would go on my top 10 if I had one, but as my enjoyment does not determine the overall, an 8 was the most I could give.\\n",

I saw them as a fictional organization thats try take down certain clans and you guessed it, take over the world, also thats what the main villain group was in Firefly.\\n\\n\r\nSome interesting trivia, Tatsuya is based off the Hindu god, Shiva The God of Destruction and Miyuki is based off the goddess Parvati, Shiva's devoted wife.\\n\\n\r\nAlso In Japan, The Irregular at Magic High School was the best selling light novel series of 2014.",

I really did love it.\r\nNow I'm a sucker for anime like this, with the magic and all the drama, it really is one of my favourite types.\r\nI really did love idea of having a magic school and the way the use the CAD (Casting Assistant Device) to use magic.\r\nThe conflict between the two groups, the course 1 and the course 2 students in the first arc because it starts off the anime with a load of drama and I loved that.\r\nI also loved Tatsuya, I'm not really sure why, It's just the way hedidn't really give a shit about anything and well I liked that.\\n\r\nI loved the characters as well, they were funny and lightened up the show when it got rather serous at times.\\n\r\nThe animation really was pretty as well with how they showed the magic and just how everything was presented it really made me swoon. If an anime had pretty animation I will be on it quicker than you can say animation :P \\n\r\nI have watched this anime like 3 times because I really, really liked and each time I was hooked.\\n\r\nI liked the fact it was split into three separate arcs because it made the story a lot clearer and easier to follow.\\n\r\nMy favourite arc was the second one because it was quite drama filled and you really got to see all the characters potential and there was a lot of magic use meaning I got to see lots of pretty animation :D\\n\\n\r\nNot going to lie the relationship between Tatsuya and Miyuki did freak me out a tiny bit but I got used to it by the end so I guess it's not really a dislike just a little something that weirded me out.\\n\r\nOh yeah and that ending also frustrated me because you suddenly get all this information about Tatsuya and its not fully explained, there is also the fact that it was ended in a cliff hanger that gave a chance for another season even though there probably wont be one.\\n\r\nI also guess again I would have like a tiny bit more back story, while there was a bit of it and hints at it it still wasn't fully explained which leaves me wondering about it and it's annoying.\\n\\n\r\nSO this was one of my favourite anime so far and I hope other people love it as much as I do",

The pacing was definitely not perfect, and the arcs seemed unrelated and almost insignificant. Despite its flaws, it doesn't have any major plot holes or other problems, and is mostly enjoyable.\r\nArt: 10/10\r\nSome of the best art, animation and character design I have seen. All the combat scenes were gripping to watch (although mostly short) and the large character cast had varied and fitting appearances throughout the show.\r\nSound: 10/10\r\nIncredible OP, and a loadof intense electronic backdrop for gripping fight scenes and such. Definitely one of the highlights of the show. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe character development was by no means bad in Mahouka, although it could have easily been better. An obvious problem is the massive cast, making major character development not a priority, or so it seems. Despite this, Tatsuya's secrets and overall overpowered-ness made the show interesting to watch, and is definitely a must-see for those who love OP MC's. However, depending on your standpoint on incest, it has the potential to make this show more or less enjoyable, even if the relationship dynamic is well done between characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI had fun watching this anime, but the enjoyment you get from it comes alot from the MC Tatsuya's overpowered-ness, how you take strong incest vibes, and how much the art/sound matter to you. I think most people would enjoy this show, and regardless of the points lost for the slightly-above average story, it was definitely worth the watch.",

I started to watch the show without any expectation whatsoever, and this show still disappoints me. Almost everything in this anime make no sense whatsoever. Now shall we enter to the review?\r\nStory: 2\r\nOne of the biggest problem with this show is the story. The premise of the show is interesting but theexecution is a total abomination. Almost nothing happens and basically everything happen in this show is only to make the MC looks awesome. This show has 3 arc and basically these arcs are like: MC-kin involved in some events, boring buildup, then something happens, Tatsuya solves it and everyone around him likes him. In most of the episodes, there'll be some very boring magic explanation nonsense going on. I know they did this to make the audience understand what's happening, but it's so boring that makes the audiences want to sleep. Tatsuya's OPness also make this show boring because he basically can solve anything. When this happen, there's no tension. There's no struggle and conflict because Tatsuya is basically God. He can solve everything.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nThe art style in this anime is honestly one of the reason I started to watched the show. But as I watching this show, the art is honestly kinda average to me. Sure the characters are beautifully draw, but the problem I have with the art is almost every characters in this show looks almost identical without their eye color and unique(kinda) hairstyle.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is kinda the another saving grace for the show for me. Some of the songs are good but unfortunately very generic and forgettable since I have heard something similar for over hundred times.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 2\\n\r\nThis is definitely the worst part of the show. Almost very characters in this show is boring, forgettable and lack development, even for the main character. The MC, Tatsuya and Miyuki is bland and boring. Tatsuya is basically a one-dimensional Gary Stu without anything remarkable about him. Miyuki is also very annoying with all of the \"I love my brother\" nonsense going on. Both Tatsuya and Miyuki is boring, stoic and unrelatable. No characters in this show feels like a actual person.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2\\n\r\nI didn't enjoy this show. Every time I watching this show, I almost fell asleep and spending my time more on messing around with my Lego sets. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3\\n\r\nAlmost everything is wrong about this show. The premise of this show is interesting, but the execution is so terrible that I presume that even myself can execute the idea of this show better. \\n\\n\r\nThis is a boring and terrible show. Find better shows to watch instead of....... this.\\n\\n",

            "content": "This show is violently defended by the sea of plebs who, having unfortunately stumbled upon it early in their anime development, don't have a proper sample to compare it to. I have frequently heard that the commercial success of this show (which was actually limited in Japan) is proof of its excellence. I'm going to settle this right now. Nicki Minaj is highly successful, and Vincent van Gogh was a failure as an artist during his lifetime. However, there is no question as to which one of these two created better art. Now that that's cleared up...\r\nDisclaimer: I apologize if this review is rather unstructured.\\n\\n\r\nThe irregular at magic high is lazy and commercialized. All the \"interesting\" dynamics in the show are taken from other, better anime. A Kuudere main character who has unbelievable hidden talents is overwhelmingly commonplace in anime. In this show however, they did change part of that formula. Overpowered MC are generally overpowered due to their overwhelming commitment to their discipline, but because of this, they are often lacking in other areas. The MC of IaMH is simply good at everything, so overwhelmingly so, that not for a moment is there the slightest bit of tension in this show. The conflict loses all it's meaning as he brushes past all obstacles with ease. Even death isn't an obstacle as he can resurrect people. The show is a never-ending series of dues ex machinas as the MC constantly uses new abilities that for some reason scale as the scope of the \"conflict\" increases. \\n\r\nThe plot has no direction what so ever and the conclusion isn't even a conclusion.The show just stops. This would be acceptable in other shows, shows that follow an episodic format or, contain separate arcs, but this show follows a linear progression. The reason this show ends this way is quite clear. The show is based on the source material (idk, if it was manga or a light novel) and the anime simply didn't last long enough to make it to the end of the source. The show suffers a great deal from pacing. Unlike truly brilliant anime, such as FMA, which effectively spread the plot across their episodes, this anime stumbles through the plot of the source.\\n\r\nAs far as the more tangible elements, the art/sound, there isn't a whole lot to be said. The artistic \"style\" of the show is limited to the excessive use of softlight. This was a prominent stylistic element in anime that had already been beaten to death long before this anime was created, but not so long ago that it offers any sense of nostalgia or even long enough that we aren't still tired of it. As for the quality of the animation, it's not terrible and it's not excellent. I'd say it's \"acceptable\" at least in my eyes. It's certainly modern animation, containing tweens and adobe flash like elements. I'm no expert on these things but those of you who actually care about such things will probably understand what I'm referring to. The use of \"lazy\" animation tactics, that new technology has made it so easy to fall back on, are certainly present in this show, but not to the point where I feel the need to give them shit about it. The voice acting didn't leave much of an impression aside from the tender relationship moments between the main character and his sister. I feel they successfully enhanced the feelings they intended to with the voice acting around these moments.\\n\r\nAs a whole, it's not like this show has nothing to offer. I mean I did watch it all the way through. There are many \"things\" happening in the \"plot\" that could be described as \"entertaining\" or \"exciting\" (sorry for all the quotes). The school genre is quite popular, and for good reason. I certainly like it, and this show has those elements. Also, for those of you who enjoy Moe little sisters, and heavily implied incestual (but never confirmed) incestual relationships, there's a lot of that. For fans of violent action anime and the whole dynamic where the OP guy pretends he's, like wimpy or something, yup got it. The point, which I hope I have established by now, is that none of it is particularly well done compared to other shows. Anime is a vast universe and if ya explore a little deeper I'm sure you'll see what I'm talking about, hopefully, even those of you who are overwhelmed by nostalgia vibes.\\n\\n",

I rather they make proper introduction of everything before moving on. Then it starts to get even worse and worse.. One thing i don't like it the most is the voice actors... They don't even seems to know what they are saying , i think... EVERYTHING IS just so stupid. I mean its cool to make new skills like \"Chidori\" ,\"Bankai\" ... But when they introduce stuff that totally soooo lame , \"CAD\" i was like , ami in some elementary school or what? And yeah .. Not badass at all.. Typical harem.. Cringy part most of it... Really hope to give it another chance BUT I JUST CAN'T.... I just don't understand how so many people like this anime as well. AND , This is not really a review , i was just probably commenting about this anime. *Probably , People have different tastes in anime after all :)* I Don't really like fiction animes like the skills name soooooo lame -_- Perhaps if they come out with better names , it will be better.",

When i say he is op (shitty spoiler alert) , i mean that he literally revives out of nowhere when he gets killed by an accident ,that kind of opness.\r\n2nd: this is what this show thinks is a good complex magic system: characters explain EVERY single spell in 5-10 minutes talks,where they talk shit no one cares about just so a braindead viewer says \"hey ,this is very complex ,such a mature show wow\" it is not complex ,the show doesn't explain how it rly works and it doesnt even matter what they say ,the main character breaks these rules anyways so.\\n\\n\r\n3rd: the plot makes no sense ,i mean.....i mean nothing it just doesnt make sense ,students agaisnt terrorist for no reason.\\n\\n\r\n4th: well almost every single character is a walking cliche, thats quite shit tbh.\\n\\n\r\n5th: this is the only good thing ,both openings are quite good.\\n\\n\r\nSeriously ,this show is probably one of the worst shows I've seen in my life ,I dropped it in chapter 21/26 because I just coulnt handle all this cliche and unnecesary exposition where a guy shoots a fucking fireball or whatever shit and they talk like it was some kind of deep mechanic for half an episode.",

This was an incredible waste of time for not only the viewers, but whoever the hell made it. \r\nThe story presents an interesting concept of a world controlled by this science driven magic, and then really limits it to school. So there's no real sense of adventure because it's all just academic nonsense.\r\nThe characters are terrible. No REAL personality written for them. They're just tropes of anime/manga stories plopped into a series. 8/10 % of the dialogue is meaningless and pushes the story forward in no way whatso ever. It's not even interesting. It's the over-explanation of how someone's magic works or it's just poorly timed meaningless banter about nothing at all. Biggest issue is the lack of growth in the main character. They downplay him as an underdog, despite the fact that he's not in any way shape or form and then just let the story continue down the same path which is \"no one can beat this guy so lets just put him in danger and watch him win easily every-time\".\\n\\n\r\nThe music is literally ear cancer. Way to drop the ball with scoring music that adds a sense of urgency. I've literally heard elevator music that resonates more emotion than this trash. \\n\\n\r\nDropped at episode 6 because the pattern of the episodes were the same and there was zero character growth. No one cares about these boring characters, placed in an incredibly boring scenario in a mediocrely interesting world. \\n\\n",

            "content": "A summary of this anime in a few words would be this:\r\nIt's pretty much magic replacing live weaponry as the tools for the world. A super OP main character with a splash of brother sister love add in some magic combat and you get this anime. Oh and most people who are magicians are badasses. \r\nNow that I've gotten the super quick summary done. I'll do the main focus of my review. The anime itself focuses around Tatsuya (older brother) and Miyuki (sister). These two have a powerful bond for each other and they continue to make everyone of their friends uncomfortable as they displayaffection for each other in public. \\n\\n\r\n(I do not do spoilers btw or at least I try not to.)\\n\\n\r\nTatsuya as I said is completely over powered. He only has one setting it seems. Extremely calm. Nothing seems to rattle him as more and more drastic situations arise. Oh and don't mess with Miyuki. He will FIND YOU and KILL YOU. \\n\\n\r\nMiyuki is the loving sister who adores her big brother. She's also extremely powerful. Her favorite spells are usually ice based. She's also really beautiful. \\n\\n\r\nThe focus becomes them going to this magic high school where magicians develop their skills for later on in life. Due to testing Tatsuya winds up as a second class student (a weed) and Miyuki is first class (a flower). \\n\\n\r\nThere are three different phases that go down in this anime throughout the 26 episodes. One focusing on the school. On focusing on this all schools sporting event and lastly...all out war. That is all I can say. The last one was especially gripping with all the action that started to come out. \\n\\n\r\nI did feel there were some unanswered questions from this anime when I finished it. Like the strange purple haired guy Zhou and what his true deal is.\\n\\n\r\nI finish by saying. If i haven't convinced you to watch it why not try it out. If you love OP Main Characters and pretty bad ass side characters and romantic situations...plus some brother-sister love fest. This anime will be for you! If over powered main characters aren't your thing maybe watching for the side characters would be a focus.",

            "content": "This is not your average magic school show. The show attempts to blend magic and technology together to present a more refined take on the magic genre. \r\nThe story is centered around the Shiba siblings as they attend a magic high school. Instead of fighting monsters and making the world safe, the show focuses on the school and the activities of the school such as tournaments and internal strife. Additionally, the show is never episodic with all episodes tying into one of the three story arcs. This maybe be off putting to some viewers who prefer definitive start/stop moments or villain of the week shows.\r\nArtis done by studio Madhouse and is very good. Magic spells are well done and flow smoothly. (I'm not a stickler for art details so there's not much to say.)\\n\\n\r\nSound is good and varied. Openings and endings are enjoyable to listen to even if they probably won't fit into a playlist. The show has transition music between scenes and various tracks for sporting events and battles. This keeps reused the assets low and adds to the overall enjoyment. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the high point of the show for me. All of the major and minor characters are given some amount of screen time. Most of this involves analyzing a recent event or a person's actions that reveals each character's perceptions and personality. This creates a wide option of characters to use in a scene without forcing them into specific situations. It has to be mentioned that the Shiba siblings are an odd couple and often flirt with incest, much to the dismay of their classmates. While never actually having a incestuous relationship, their behavior can be objectionable. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment depends on the viewers preferences. If you enjoy desperate battles and clothing inexplicably melting from magic power; this isn't the show for you. Magic is explained and enhanced through science. Which means sometimes lengthy explanations. This slows the pace down making battles more calculated and decisive. Additionally, the siblings are incredibly OP. Overall power is something determined at birth in this series, so training montages or power growth is not present. Because of this viewers could feel unsatisfied at the lack of challenge facing the characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it is a very good show. It won't win points for riveting action or over the top flashy sequences, but viewers who stick around for story and characters won't be disappointed.",

I mean if everything else was average then this anime would have no redeeming features, but it creates a setting, background intrigue and a lattice of interrelationships on multiple levels and does it fairly well to form a story not about Tatsuya and Miyuki, but about how a world of magic doesn't just make it about saving princesses or fighting a single bad organization with one side good the other evil. Rather thereis no good side only the lesser of two evils. Take the first villain of the story Blanche, their  agenda was normal people fighting against elitism of magicians, which really turned out to be just a political play from another country, in the end elitism and national safety won against equality and foreign interference (I think that was a really indirect jab at America but I can't say).\\n\r\nThen the next one was about establishing how magic was used and opening a darker plot of Boosters (experimentation and torture of magicians to make killing weapons, kind of glazed over it a little) vs enjoyment and fun of magic (NSC). They also tossed in lineage and skill vs technological back up and planning. \\n\r\nLastly we have the Theoretical Competition where it is just about freedom of information vs safety and finally how magic works in realistic combat (I don't think the fight scenes were that great though).\\n\\n\r\nThe art I liked the characters weren't over the top with spikey hair, or blue and green hair colors, as well as the magic animation wasn't overblown but executed nicely.\\n\\n\r\nI did like the OP and ED it was nice and had no complaints.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters, well we have OP MC to infinity he can't die, he can kill easily and he doesn't care about anything except his sister or if people ask him to help. Miyuki was poorly done since they didn't really explain her near Yandere devotion to her brother. Then the rest were mildly done with little development but like I said they focused more on development of groups and relations like the 10 Familys, the Army, the country, and such. As for the supporting characters we have Tatsuya's group which consists of new students all trying to overcome their limitations as Weeds, each one has a unique skill which makes them useful but they never really take center stage, except in group fights or against other students, but they are never involved in the main story to a major role throughout.\\n\\n\r\nWell that aside seeing a guy disintegrate other people is always fun and it was new, plus how they applied magic was unique as oppose to the annoying fire, water, wind, earth elements, it was more similar to Nanoha system of magic relying on tech assist. I enjoyed it because it moved the progression of perception of Tatsuya ,Weeds  & Blooms, and the role of magicians in society and how they are working to overturn the soldier mentality and stuff.\\n\\n\r\nWell that aside the anime is one of the better ones out there and I would watch another season if possible, well that's all I got.",

            "content": "I still remember being told that this anime was going to be one of the greatest animes of the spring season. While I do have to say that it has a few strong points, it also has multiple flaws that prove that prediction wrong. (spoilers here)\r\nStory-8/10\r\nThis anime is actually an anime that explains magic. Magic in this time period was engineered so that magicians could be created and used in war and such. It's 2095 and World War III ended years ago, but magicians are still being bred for the future. Tatsuya Shiba and Miyuki Shiba are extraordinary magicians who start off attending First HighSchool for magicians. Tatsuya is constantly looked down upon and underestimated for being a \"Weed\"--a 2nd course student who didn't place as a 1st course student like his slightly younger sister.\\n\\n\r\nArt-6/10\\n\r\nI have to say that the art style is pretty original but average. The character designs aren't perfect and neither is the scenery, but it's consistent. And by consistent, I'm saying that it doesn't go from shitty to slaying from one scene to another.\\n\\n\r\nSound-8/10\\n\r\nThe sound is a pretty strong point in this anime. Both of the OPs are fantastic and background music is nicely matched most of the time. The voice actors were alright, but my favorite was Tatsuya's because his voice was so dull sounding because he was a pretty dull character.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-5/10\\n\r\nThis is where everything gets a bit messy for me. Tatsuya Shiba is your typical 'OP Male MC'. Emotionless but slays the game everytime somehow. Everytime someone underestimates him, Tatsuya shows them that doing that was the wrong thing to do by kicking their ass. Of course, there were times where I would scream,  \"YAAAAS TATSUYA LEEGOOOO\". But after awhile, that's all he ever did. He never failed or ever got emotional. It got boring. Of course, I know the reason why he's so emotionless, but they don't even explain that in the anime!! I found out by how? Spoilers. I think that they should've explained Tatsuya's dullness a bit more than they did. Anyways, I'm glad that a \"Sword Art Online\" wasn't pulled where the MC starts having trauma so \"big\" that they go into a mental breakdown for like 3 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then there's Miyuki Shiba. I feel like they pulled an Asuna Yukki on her. (Sorry I just compare shitty things to Sword Art Online out of habit now) Miyuki is a total badass, but I hate to admit that they belittle her character to being a brocon. Miyuki is great; freezing things with magic is her specialty and she is super smart. But of course after a while, Miyuki only fights every now and then and then what's left is Tatsuya Shiba slaying the game once again and protecting Miyuki which makes her blush every five seconds. One of the things that irritated me the most was that it seemed as if Miyuki only lived for her brother. She always wanted to get permission  from him first about things and always listened to him and even if someone said his name in her presence, she'd turn to them and give them a hardcore death glare. You see, when I say that they pulled an Asuna Yukki, I mean that they made Miyuki seem like she was JUST an obsessive person. Obsessed with the person she loves. A Tatsuya Shiba fangirl. They write a character with great potential and just wreck it so that the male mc seems so cool. I've watched animes with brocons before, but this is one of the the only times that I feel that the character would be super irrelevant if the fanservice didn't rely on them. What's even grosser is that when you look up \"tatsuya shiba mahouka koukou no rettousei\" on google, you see a shitload of fan art and caps of Tatsuya + Miyuki, and it pretty much assured me 99.9% that a lot of the readers/viewers only mention Miyuki when Tatsuya's present. It's as if Miyuki's not even her own character.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-6\\n\r\nThe first arc and Nine Schools Competition excited me the most, but they ended on one of the most confusing and boring arcs.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-6\\n",

            "content": "What do you get if you mix sibling love, magic and a protagonist who barely has any emotion? You get this anime. \r\nStory: 9/10\r\nThe story in this anime can make you sit for hours, just watching it, continuing without a care of what's happening in the outside world. It gave me goosebumps, watching through this anime. A story like this is very similar to other anime, also most of them being successful too. A protagonist who is a mere highschool student on the outside, but being one of the strongest characters in that anime in the inside. The only unique part here is of course,the sibling love, which can be very comedic most of the times. Each episode leaves you hanging, wanting to know what happens next.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe colors are very vibrant, not too dull. The animation is also smooth. Nothing much to say, this anime was released in 2014 so the art was to be expected.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI find myself rocking to the music sometimes, recognizing that there is some type of electric music playing in the background. The OP matched the theme of this anime, being mostly action. The ED fitted too, fading in at the last minute of every episode. I'm not the type to really judge on OP/ED.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI was looking for an anime that had a cool protagonist in an action anime, and I was impressed when I first saw this anime. Tatsuya is that type of guy who doesn't care about anyone else deeply except for one person. The way he handles things, how he talks, strategizing with his peers, he's basically the biggest badass in this anime. Miyuki, on the other hand, acts very elegantly. Of course, she has some weak spots like her brother, blushing whenever her brother compliments her dress, her looks or her actions towards people. Of course, if the relationship between the 2 siblings progress into incest, I would be fine with that mainly because their relationship was strong even at the beginning of the anime. But of course, laws in media in Japan bans incest.\\n\r\n(i'm not a siscon/brocon)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10 \\n\\n\r\nThis anime has very high re-watch value for me, not only because it has 24 episodes, every time you watch an episode, there will be surprises and maybe hair standing on your neck, if you're watching Tatsuya fight.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nWhat else can I say? It worked nicely as a school, sci-fi, romance, magic, supernatural, shounen anime. I'm surprised action isn't listed in the genre, but oh well.",

I liked the sound effects too. I don't know how they made them, but that was cool (actually though it's interesting to listen to the sound effects for each spell). I'm probably just a sucker for any anime nowadays that doesn't have a stupid useless main character, but this show comes off a bit too much on the high end of that. Our protagonist is exceptional in everything he does and this leaves essentially noroom for character development, and we don't see much in the way of development apart from secondary characters. I would rate this a 6.5 because of great art and sounds and story, but then I realized that the art is actually pretty decent so I decided to give it a 7. Worth a watch if you like magic anime with a strong male protagonist.",

Along with a boring show, the characters were stale, hiding any type of human emotion and making the characters unbelievable.  First off, the magic in the show isn't even magic, it is all future technology, secondly, they hardly spend any time in school, they actually divided the show into three parts that have nothing to do with each other. Further more, the sound track was terrible, andat times a little cringe worthy.

            "content": "Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei was quite an enjoyable watch! \r\nRight off the bat, though, it must be mentioned that this anime is not for everyone! I say this for a couple of reasons. \r\n1. The main character (protagonist) is extremely talented, borderline perfect. He is a very talented magician and engineer with only a minor flaw. \r\n2. There is a lot of dialogue explaining the theories behind the magic used. \r\n3. There is a hint of incest between the main character and his younger sister. \r\nIn any case, some of the same points mentioned above can be reasons one would like the anime. \r\nAs forone, I enjoyed watching the main character. Although he is very talented and intellectually gifted, he lacks a fundamental skill: the physical manipulation of magic. Throughout the anime, it can be observed that the main character works around his limitations by using his other skills to the max. It is his thinking process and the way he works through a predicament that makes the story and conflicts interesting, despite his character being near-perfect. It is also interesting to see how the plot slowly reveals how much power this character possesses. (It's almost as if the main character is a little mysterious, and you slowly uncover the mystery as you watch the anime.)\\n\\n\r\nAs for another, I feel that the theories and explanations regarding the magic used in a fight, or a newest invention, really makes the anime more realistic. It shows that magic is really contingent on science. It shows that magic is not only an innate ability, but also a system that involves science and technology. Hearing the hypothetical theories and analysis of magic used in fights is quite interesting and makes it seem more logical and practical.\\n\\n\r\nAs for incest... well, I can't say I approve of it, but their interaction, if you overlook that they are siblings, was quite sweet, even if it is a bit edgy, in a romantic sense. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime is not only technical from a logical perspective, but also includes the fantasy aspects, such as a lot of magic. \\n\\n\r\nSo, if you enjoy slowing finding out about a character as the anime progresses, this anime is for you. If you enjoy watching characters plan and problem solve, this anime is for you. If you enjoy reasoning, and you just like to hear what some would consider to be \"textbook boring\" dialogue, then this anime is for you! If you enjoy sweet sibling interactions, this anime is also for you! \\n\\n\r\nI hope you enjoyed this review, and hopefully it was helpful. Thanks for reading!",

Honestly, I think the former are uninformed/younger watchers who are just along for the ride without looking at the technical aspects of a good anime, while the latter are the pompous otakus who overanalyze the hell out of everything they watch. This anime is a solid average. Will you remember it for years to come? Probably not. But it is enjoyable to watch. Here's a quick and dirty list of some pros and cons:\r\nPros:\r\n- Fantastic art\r\n- Good soundtrack, if a little repetitive\r\n- Badass fight scenes\r\n- A few likeable characters (Erika and Leo for me)\r\n- Take onmagic is unique and interesting\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- Bad story. Plot essentially felt nonexistent at times\\n\r\n- MC is boring and extremely overpowered (it is fun to watch him wreck people though)\\n\r\n- A bit harem-ish for my liking\\n\r\n- Sister-brother love. That's just wrong\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, this kinda seems like it was designed to be a wish-fulfillment anime for fat, lonely otakus with little attention paid to the story. The MC is ridiculously strong and constantly has women throwing themselves at him, even his sister. There were so many scenes that I felt were designed expressly to make Tatsuya look cool in front of his friends (hey soldier, we're gonna discuss your top secret mission in front of everyone so they can all see how badass you are). The villains are forgettable, mainly just there so Tatsuya has someone to destroy. They kept dropping hints about the MCs backstory but I guess decided to never explain it (What happened to Tatsuya  when he was young? Why are they no longer Yotsubas?).\\n\\n\r\nBut aside from all that nonsense, I still enjoyed the anime. The fight scenes were awesome, and the science/magic hybrid concept is pretty unique and cool. I actually enjoyed the exposition that everyone seems to hate. It's not as bad as these snobs would have you believe.",

            "content": "When I first saw the show, there was something about it that made me want to watch it. I wasn't sure what it was at first, but as soon as the plot started to move along I really started to like it. The show is fast paced with great characters who really allow the show to set itself apart from others. The introduction of magic, slowly shows the rift between those who can use magic and those who can't. The show never has a dull moment. Whether it is the Nine Schools Competition Arc or the Yokohama Disturbance Arc, the show just keeps building onitself. The main character Tatsuya and his sister Miyuki have an interesting relationship between one another to say the least. This was my one gripe with this otherwise incredible show because I felt very awkward whenever Miyuki tried to make a move with her brother. However being able to look past these moments, always proved to be the best thing because the show always followed it up with a very well done action sequence. The art for this show is done very well. It is both bright and vibrant, which really make the show stand out in an action genre. The way this anime integrated CGI into the 2-D world make it look really well. I would compare it's flawless integration to that of the CGI in the Neon Genesis Evangelion rebuild films. Overall, I highly recommend this show to anyone who wants an all around great show.",

            "content": "Here's a video review of it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQ9NlSmJZ8\r\nFirst off wow.... Just wow.\r\nAt the start of this anime I expected nothing but generic and to be honest this anime doesn't start off the best way.\u00a0\r\nIt doesn't really do much to explain what is going, why can't he use magic, why is he at a lower level, and the uniform colors felt so plain.\r\nBut if you like anime shows with action and a decent story line similar to anime series like Guilty Crown and Tokyo Ravens then this is right up your alley. At the start this anime starts off with two main characters who are brother andsister, while the relationship between them feels off you can tell its mostly on the sisters side.\u00a0\\n\r\nThis anime series is based off a world where magic exists and has been utilized as a technology for nearly a century and while explaining it would be rather confusing without watching the anime\u2026 I'll try my best to break it down in simpler terms. In the anime Mages use something called a Casting Assistant Device or CAD\u2026 at least that\u2019s how I pronounce it. Mages use thought particles or psions to activate sequences which invoke magic spells basically. A good way to sum up this concept is imagine if you wanted to do a spell, rather than memorize each spell mentally you could save it in CAD and simply activate it with the thought of wanting to use that spell.\\n\r\nThe plot in the anime is basically about Tatsuya and Miyuki who are both brother and sister. They are new students who enrolled at a Private Magic University Affiliated High School. In this school the students are ranked based on their test scores reflecting on mainly their practical magic ability skills. Students who score higher are put into a Course 1 curriculum and those who score lower are enrolled in Course 2.\\n\r\nUnfortunately, when you separate students based on a certain attribute you eventually end up with issues mainly things like bullying which this school has. The two separate courses are known as Bloom and Weed although the term is against the school policy and it's quite disrespectful.\\n\r\nTatsuya unfortunately was put in Course 2 while his sister was put in Course 1. As the story progresses you immediately see the mistreatment of Course 2 students. Tatsuya however isn't on the same level as the rest of the students. He may lack skills in magic, but his stamina for what he has allows him to learn some high level Magic Spells that don't require a high amount of magic to be used. Also while he isn't good at magic all that well, he is incredibly smart and extremely good at physical combat, combined with his magic, he makes simple basic magic spells become amplified and much stronger than they were initially.\\n\r\nWhile Tatsuya is the main character of the story for the most part, his sister plays a role in sort of guiding Tatsuya and pushing him to try to push himself to prove that magic isn't the only important skill. Throughout the anime you see that to be true.\\n\r\nThe Story itself is pretty damn good, as generic as the anime may sound it does have its own way of telling its story. At the start is does a very good job explaining a lot of the spells so that you understand how this world works, the plot for the main half of the story is probably the most exciting part in my opinion. While I left out some stuff, a lot of the good stuff I'd love to talk about contains spoilers to the anime that could down play some of the plots, but there is more to Tatsuya that really builds up his character that I didn't mention.On that note I'd love to say that the cast of characters was pretty good, while they never went too deep with those characters and their backgrounds, they never felt bland or boring at all.\\n\\n\r\nLet's get to the review.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 8 | Amazing!\\n\r\nBefore I get bashed on this, the story itself if beyond amazing\u2026. But for the first half, everything is paced out a bit too slow but at least they take time to explain a lot of the magic and go into detail about the main characters, mainly towards the lives they live and what else they work on aside from the school itself. But the second half is what hurts the anime, it sort of becomes a war without meaning, at least not well explained. I don't want to spoil what goes on during the second half, but it sort of rushes you through everything, and kind of destroys a lot of the mystery behind Tatsuya who the whole anime was based on. In a way I can say that if there is a second season the school portion part will either be a hit or miss, it can be worked into something real good or can completely be a disaster.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 7 | Quite Good\\n\r\nThe characters in the anime are extremely good when it comes to support, they actually feel like they are part of the story and not just there to fill the gap of other students the school. The majority of the cast gets very little back story if any at all aside from one or two characters. However for this particular case I didn't mind all that much, for what we learned about the characters throughout the anime was good enough and the support towards the Main Characters Tatsuya and his sister was enough to keep the anime going strong. But while I enjoyed the characters, I did wish the relationship between the characters could've grown more, each character had some character development but it always had to be when Tatsuya was there, never anything aside from that. If Tatsuya wasn't there then there would be no character development, just a minor gripe against it.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation - 6 | It's Okay\\n\r\nFor 2014 the anime feels kinda dated, it not that the visuals are bad but so many anime series are pushing on towards looking so colorful and smooth, while this anime had extremely dull color pallet overall. Nothing really popped, and while sometimes it didn't matter, other times it just made some of the characters sink in with the background, if it was not for the story this anime could have fallen part cause of this. Luckily the fight scenes are pretty damn amazing, and while the colors feel dull, the animation for the fights and suspense of the story keep you sucked in enough to not care. Which proves art isn't everything.\\n\\n\r\nMusic/Sound - 6 | It's Okay\\n\r\nThe OST itself was okay, mainly the one issue I had was that there was one song that always played when there was a fight scene but at least it was a good song. The sound and voice acting were good\u2026 not amazing but not terrible though it was better than acceptable. The Opening and Ending Tracks I actually liked a lot.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9 | Astonishing!\\n\r\nYou may be wondering why everything else seemed so low and this score is much higher.. Well the best way I can put it is that this anime may not have the best visuals or even the best characters but the story and world is so good. Sure it's not amazing, but it's different from most anime shows that use magic with science. Tatsuya grows and proves that Magic really isn't everything despite him not being the best Mage there. He knows when he can win a match versus when he needs help. To be honest if it wasn't because they explained how the magic worked I would've turned away but because they explained it enough to the point where I can understand I wanted to learn more about enemies in the anime and how Tatsuya could overcome things that were out of his level in some way. This anime is likely a guilty pleasure of mine.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Rating: 7 |  Quite Good [Exact Rating - 7.2]\\n\r\nLet's be clear the anime isn't the best anime to ever come to existence, it has some faults which are pretty big and my make some people not want to watch the anime like the pacing at the start, not much story for a lot of the characters, and the art being just overall okay. But the Story in the anime really holds it, the way everything is explained in the first couple of episodes and how Tatsuya proves himself out throughout the anime. Where the plot gets dull is around the end but it kind of left me wanting more and wondering what would turn out after what happens. What also kind of sucked is we didn't really  learn much about the organization or gang thing that they were sort of associated with which I was left like uhhhh okay???? The characters were basically there for just support, and while that's okay maybe some story about the ones who were seen the most would have been nice, but there was some character development going on but not much since the anime was centered around Tatsuya. The OST could be rather forgettable aside from the Opening and Ending songs which I liked, but it could be cause it had LiSA's song \"Rising Hope\", and LiSA has had other songs I really enjoyed. Probably my main issue was the uniform colors, it just felt so boring and dull, but you get over it eventually. I will end with saying that the first 1-3 or 1-4 episodes were pretty boring because it has a lot to do with explaining a crud load of stuff and for an \"action\" anime there isn't much action until a few more episodes down. Around Episode 5 the anime begins to stir some interesting plots and the action begins soon after, I recommend most stick with it if you liked Anime Shows like Guilty Crown and Tokyo Ravens, but if you didn't like those anime then this won't be your cup of tea. As for me I loved both Guilty Crown and Tokyo Ravens and while it wasn't as amazing as those two, it was anime worth watching.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I will not write a large review because all the other reviews cover almost all the good/bad aspects of this show. I will mention some bad points I found:\r\n -First of all, despite all what fans say about novels, what you get on screen is what is important for an anime; and what you get on screen is what you would get if you put Hadji from Blood+ in a high school & magic series. The MC is an emotionless guardian of a High School girl, but what you see in the series is that he is more focused in helping in club activitiesthan guarding this girl. This overpowered emotionless sis-con main character ends up involved in some \"High-school police club\" and in a \"science project\" in the last arc, only to show he is super cool minded and intelligent and strong. But if he has no feelings why he participates in activities that feed ego, and if he is so intelligent how the convince him??\\n\r\nThe only girl that doesn't fall for him, is just used for a scene where they say something like this : \"You like Tatsuya but as he is super power full and cool and you are just mediocre you choose a mediocre boy, because you will never be as godlike like him\"\\n\r\n -Second, they over explain everything. When they cast a spell they explain all the steps and the names and the calculations,etc. It is not intelligent, it fills empty spaces with senseless blah blah blah...\\n\\n\r\n Conclusion: As the anime is 100% the main character and the main character is inconsistent and empty (ON SCREEN) and isn't enough interesting (At least without the novels information) , the show is quite monotone and repetitive. \\n\\n\r\n(Story 2 + Art 6 + Sound 5 + Character 1 + Enjoyment 1)/5 = 3",

            "content": "Another long english title. Here we have a show that seems to have a ton of production value go into it, and what came out of it was an uneven balance scale. On one hand, you got amazing action scenes with a hit or miss soundtrack for viewers, on the other you got a very underdevloped world with under developed characters. What happens when you combine these two? The irregular at magic high school.\r\nI'll start with the story which seems to be really unfocused and seems to be an ass pull as means to develop the world we experience in the show. Well it sureas hell did not do that. The show starts with our prodigy main protagonist Tatsuya go to school. I wonder who the title can be referring to. The story is pretty vague until the end, this prodigy protagonist has a sister he very much adores and the feeling is mutual. Tatsuya is amazing but is ranked as low as a noob; so the story starts out with all the characters finding out just how amazing he is and the potential he holds. Then we get to see him pull shit out of his ass and everything just happens to be better/resolved whenever he does it. \\n\\n\r\nNow the beef that I have with this story is that we get an understanding of how magic became part of the world, but the story does not dive deeper into what it could be. Things like discrimination are briefly mentioned, but that is just within the school. What about the rest of world? Is there a reason some people can't use magic and what are the terrorist groups true motives? Unfortunately these realistic themes were not tackled; I believe part of this was due to this show being a high school setting. Overall, story is wasted potential and is very predictable with a bunch of asspulls and plot conveniences.\\n\\n\r\nOkay so the characters can be summed up with 2 words, one dimensional. It's not a big deal for me if the main protagonist was a genius and that their overpowered abilities were justified, but having a bunch of characters being on the same boat? It just makes every action scene feel underwhelming, predictable, pretentious, tedious, etc. There is really nothing much to say about the characters because they were so underdeveloped and there was a boatload of characters introduced to us. The show is set up where viewers just need to watch the eye candied action scenes. As for other aspects of the characters, you know the show's romance is bad when the side characters have a more genuine romantic relationship compared to the main protagonist and heroine. \\n\r\nside note: it got pretty annoying when the plot influenced Tatsuya's actions and the characters were on his d!ck the whole time, especially Miyuki (onee sama)\\n\\n\r\nSound is hit or miss for viewers i think. There is a mix of dubstep, EDM and soft medleys through the OST. I found it to be pretty average, no standouts. I liked the first opening and both endings. Disliked the 2nd opening. Voice actors are a little bland but its deserved since bland characters and bland story.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation is pretty sick. Leave it to Madhouse to make some sick action scenes involving magic and matrix like movements. Character designs were standard, but the gore and spells were on point. \\n\\n\r\nI came into this show knowing that Tatsuya was a very very strong protagonist and its not like that bugged me, but the lack of development for everything put me off. There were just too many plot conveniences that made him stand out and it was like a broken record by the end of the show. I felt like I've been left in the desert to dry up while Tatsuya goes does whatever and makes it better. The potential of the story is astounding, but it is limited to this high school setting. I mean it's just so convenient to have a high school freshman be so capable right? Assuming the intended audience is for teens, then this show certainly fulfills that gap. \\n\r\nWell for what we got, its pretty decent to watch for the animation. I can't recommend this though since it feels repetitive and gets boring quickly. It amazes me that top tier class production studios and voice actors were used for this. \\n\\n\r\ni never want to hear the words \"onee sama\" ever again",

They also spiral out of control and describe, in excessive detail, the overly specific nature of some of the things happening in the show.\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10: Animated by the famous Madhouse, which means it is excellently fluid and well animated, especially during high-action moments. But this also means the chances for a second season is virtually none. Not that it is a bad thing, considering where the Light Novel is currently treading as of Volume 16 onwards. It would likely be torn apart and cop-out filled nonsense, so that is a plus.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10: Perfectly fine sound and voice acting. Ironically stars a few voice actors from \"OreImo\" as the main characters with incest subtext surrounding them. Action sequence sound and \"Magic\" casting are all well done and didn't seem out of place either, moreover they fit in well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10: Character development was moreover sketchy in this. In reality there was very little character development outside of select moments which then escalated to dramatically.\\n\\n\r\n- Tatsuya Shiba - Incapable of feeling any emotion towards anyone but his sister. Sees women flirting with him as general annoyances and cannot comprehend their feelings whatsoever. He frequently turns a blind eye to any flirty behavior towards him and even mocks them in some cases while confirming to his sister that he is thoroughly not interested. He even brushes off a love confession in the Light Novels with a completely emotionless face.\\n\\n\r\n- Miyuki Shiba - Tatsuya's younger sister by a poultry 11 months, meaning they are virtually the same age and even misinterpreted as twins early on in the first episode. She is disgusted by the mere notion of spending her life with anyone but her brother, and is incredibly obvious about her Incestuous love for him. Of which is convenient since he is effectively lobotomized and can only feel any emotion towards her specifically. She is also portrayed as \"the perfect women\", flawless looks, polite, ladylike, graceful, etc. So much so that even her brother is frequently mesmerized by her beauty and has to regain his composure. He also comments on her, which makes her extremely happy, considering her Incestuous thoughts.\\n\\n\r\n- Saegusa Mayumi - The student council president, and also an airhead with, as Tatsuya quotes, unrealistic and unreachable ideals that would destroy the foundation of society. She apparently has feelings for Tatsuya, of which he is thoroughly annoyed by and ignores.\\n\\n\r\n- Masaki Ichijou - Some bloke introduced halfway through the anime series. So egotistical that he ignores any and all women that try to get his attention, and only sees Miyuki as a love interest because she is powerful and perfect. This crush is incredibly one-sided though as Miyuki is especially repulsed by him. This is very evident in the novels, as the anime instead opts to have her reluctantly ignore his very presence without further explanation.\\n\\n\r\nNobody else specifically matters, and is only there to push the plot forward at times.\\n\\n\r\n- SPOILER - After a marriage is *gleefully* arranged between 2 other characters in Volume 16 of the light novel, the fathers of Mayumi and Masaki try to force the marriage apart for their own personal gains. What is even more insulting about this is that the Mayumi and Masaki have little to no intentions themselves to break up the marriage. It's just that their fathers forced them to confess their undeveloped feelings for the soon-to-be-wed couple and are trying to use these undeveloped feelings as leverage. It doesn't work at all, and to the contrary it is reinforced by saying that they were quite literally made for and are destined to be with one-another. Reinforced further by quoting that \"Separating them is quite literally causing the end of the world\".\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10: The plot wasn't actually very predictable in each story arc, which is a plus. Loads of anime you can guess exactly how a story arc is going to end as soon as it starts. In this case yes, you know the overpowered Main Characters Tatsuya and Miyuki will probably win. But it is never really obvious that they will, nor does it follow an overly linear path. The smaller arcs within the main arcs are frequently explored and solved in interesting ways.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10: A reasonable introduction to the series, as most of Madhouse' productions are seeing as they generally refuse to do sequels or second seasons of any kind. It explores the original content well and doesn't exclude too much detail to the point that continuing with the source material doesn't make sense. For those who hate overpowered Main Characters, probably don't watch it. For others, it serves as an intro and nothing more to the series, as it doesn't go too far into detail, but doesn't quite go far enough if you think about it too hard.",

Skip the paragraph explanation if you dont want it. \r\nIt's a pretty boring show, you wait and wait for something interesting to happen, even the fights are boring, the main character being the strongest never really does anything cool like the usual norm, I got to episode 23 after getting fed up with their \"turbo encabulator\" explanations and long drawn out talks. Its pretty annoying that they try to push the incest thing so hard, the sister gets my blood boiling, her average dialogue includes the words I'm sorry every other sentence. Cliche characters as faras the eye can see, the MC heartless and super strong but he loves his sister and will do anything including snipe bad guys from 2km's away standing on top of a sky scraper. Then theres the  tom boy friend, there's the cute feminine one that cant make eye contact without blushing and cant get 2 words out without stuttering. theres sexual tension all over the place that never gets resolved. The story is pretty slow, its kind of like a detective show, something happens, they investigate, and the the genius MC figures it all out pretty anticlimactic. \\n\\n\r\nI guess if I watch the last 3 episodes I might find some closure to my complaints but its too boring to sit through that hour...I read the summaries on Wikipedia and...MEH.\\n\\n\r\nstory = 7 its good but didnt keep me on the edge of my seat,,, matter fact i was constantly pausing playing a game of csgo cause Its pretty boring. I tended to skip about 5-10 mins an episode. There's shows that are smart, and are smart about being smart, this isnt, hence the \"turbo encabulator\" reference. \\n\\n\r\nart = 7 its good, your average anime\\n\\n\r\nmusic = 6 that stupid whistle bell song is pretty annoying, nothing sound wise really got my attention. \\n\\n\r\ncharacters = 5 cliche. no real development.

Secrets that reveal how powerful he actually is.\\n\\n\r\n-Spoilers Below-\\n\\n\r\nTatsuya actually wields a unique type of magic (counter-magic), being the potential heir to the Yotsuba clan, his family\u2019s clan and also one of the strongest clans amongst the Ten Master Clans, he got rejected as a member when his Sister was born due to his inability to wield \u2018proper magic\u2019 (destruction magic) the thing is, Tatsuya\u2019s magic is extremely powerful, much stronger than his Sister whom is also Overpowered as hell.\\n\\n\r\nTatsuya got subjected to experiments to enhance his magic powers in hopes of allowing him to use other magic making him even more powerful. He is basically a weapon and because he would not be the heir, the heir was passed on to his sister whom he got reduced to be the guardian of. Not to say he doesn\u2019t love his Sister, he loves her very much and holds no grudges against her.\\n\\n\r\nHe has sworn to protect his Sister and also, since he was a genius he devised and manufactured weapons and magic spells/techniques for the military and personal use enhancing his weak magic prowess making him an even larger force to be reckoned with. Now we begin to ponder why he doesn\u2019t just take back the heir by battling his aunt, the master of the clan.\\n\\n\r\nAlong the anime, the people he meet are weaker than he  however are also extremely strong because Tatsuya is in a world of his own, unrivalled.\\n\\n\r\nThese strong people command much power and begin to acknowledge Tatsuya after catching glimpses of his prowess.\\n\\n\r\n-Spoiler End-\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is filled with intense fight scenes with a very good development of characters, not the best but there is a sequel movie I hope they will provide the other details in. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound effects are also very good and OP is of SAIKO as LiSA is in it.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are also pretty decent except some like Fujibayashi and Mibu, aren\u2019t they just rip-off designs of Rin Tohsaka???\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR\\n\\n\r\nGreat anime\\n\r\nLiSA sang the OP\\n\r\nOverpowered MC with a mountain of secrets\\n\r\nOVERPOWERED MC from an OVERPOWERED FAMILY\\n\r\nMC has a hell lot of family problems and is a big mystery\\n\\n\r\nMC has a harem\\n\r\nCute girls and beautiful slice of life scenes, even a \u2018accidentally walked in on a pretty girl bathing scene\u2019\\n\\n\r\nCool graphics and sound effects\\n\\n\r\nDope ass visuals\\n\\n\r\nBro sis romance\\n\\n\r\nSister Complex\\n\r\nBro complex\\n\\n\r\nHentai <<Jk if there is, the reruns on this show will be uncountable",

            "content": "So this Anime has quite the variation of reviews on it, so heres my take on it. \r\nI stumbled onto this anime after watching Hagure Yuusha no Esthetica, and it was in my PTW for a while.  Apparently when it came out it was a \"hot\" anime at the time, one of those highly anticipated ones. \r\nStory\r\nIts good but not great. Honestly its largely a rerun on the magic school genre with an overpowered MC in the mix. Its a good formula, but not an original one. This anime also uses the \"three-arc\" storyline for the anime, but this time around it felt muchmore in place, and connected with each other. For the most part, the arcs connected together, most likely due to it's 26-episode length. Story was engaging, but the OP MC never loses, so you already know vaguely whats going to happen. The Romance aspect is there and its a great counterpoint to the fighting/competition. However, this anime does have A LOT of moving parts that don't get explained even with it's dialogue heavy beginning. I liked the premise of how magic became accepted and the world alliances were a nice dystopian touch. overall an 8 out of 10. \\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\r\nArt and animation was fluid, dynamic, and it was visually appealing. Basically the girls were cute and the guys were cool looking. Gears, weapons, unifroms were appealing, and modern. building architecture was futuristic. none of the colors were too bright or sharp, although they were more pastel-y than I would have liked. This is one of the few anime that doesn't suffer from the colorful hair syndrome, where all the MCs have colorful hair and everyone else doesn't. However, I did notice that for some reason there seemed to be a huge amount of guys in relation to the girls. that is at other schools. anytime there were a crap-ton of students gathered, most were guys, even though there must have been girls too. Either way, a solid 10/10 for art.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nHOLY. CRAP. IT. IS. GOOD. Not only were the opening and ending songs great pieces of music, it was the quality of music WITHIN the anime that really got me. the combination of subtle techno/electric music with the futuristic setting and the cool-animated magic was a master move by the director. And im not one to exaggerate. I rarely ever hear the sound in an anime, and I rarely listen to opening/closing songs, but man these were great. Voice actors fit the characters well, there werent any curveballs or misfits. The sound of weaponry, magic, and fighting was more or less realistic. 10/10 cus I actually noticed the music for once, and it just fit so well with the anime. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nTheyre all pretty damn good. like i said before, visually appealing. Most of them do not undergo any sort of character change though. However, they all do serve some purpose, and all exemplify a certain strength that makes them work well as a team. And thats were the bulk of the points for the characters come in. Even though there is alot, and even though I cant remember the names of them all, all of them had a purpose, they weren't placed there just as placeholders or people for the MC to exploit. All of the characters had genuine personality, struggles, and purpose. These come together beautifully, and the synergy between them is amazingly done. however...\\n\r\nNote:OP MC\\n\r\nOk so spoilers maybe. THIS MC IS SUPER OVERPOWERED. he is basically a military genius who enrolls in a high school for magic. But, because he can't move a block on the floor with ease, he sucks by academy standards. He is literally on the cutting edge of magic in his world and is coming up with analytical solutions to age-old magic conundrums. He goes around one-shotting anything that can move (living or mechanical), and also can obliterate a platoon of 20-30 warships with one shot. He has the ability to do a complete and instantaneous regen on himself or his allies. . He has extremely high pain tolerance levels, but not that he ever needs it for himself cus he almost never gets hurt. He's holding back on his power for like 90% of the series. With that said, I personally actually loved that. his power is awesome. the best i can describe it is he has the ability to take apart/ put things back together at the atomic level. with one shot of course. But I also understand that OP MCs, or MCs that never lose aren't for everyone so be forewarned if you dislike this. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nObviously this is a subjective category but for me I was highly influenced by my own \"chuunibyou\" fantasies. I have always dreamed up of a setting where I had an Overpowered ablilty like Tatsuya's and the support of a diverse team behind me. To see it now 10 years later in an anime, and such a well done one at that was a trip down nostalgia lane. However, that was not the only reason I enjoyed it. It has all the elements that I like such as fantasy, romance, school setting, and of course the OP MC. On top of that this was the first 26-episode series that I watched, and I have to say the length was actually enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\na weak 10/10. I would give it a 9.5 or 9.7  if I could. I liked everything about it except the story. It had great premises, setting, and meshing but it was just a bit too unexplained, and a bit too trite for me to absolutely enjoy. The OP MC was also predictable with outcomes, but I can't bring myself to dock a full point for just those things. so Id say overall, 2 for story + 2 for characters + 2.5 for art +2.5 for music + 1 for nostalgia - 0.2 for unexplained story and -0.1 for predictability = 9.7/10. \\n\\n\r\nPeace.",

Don't get me wrong, there are anime that have emotionless characters, but are still able to make the characters interesting and understandable. This anime doesn't even try to explain SO many things in this anime. I finished this anime with so many questions and the anime gloss over it like it is nothing. The \"romance\" is pretty lame as the sister likes the brother, but the brother sees his sister as someone he has to protect than alove interest.\\n\\n\r\nThe main thing that made this anime one of my least favorite anime was the tension. There was absolutely no tension. The main character is so powerful, it is hard to feel like anyone will ever be in danger. It makes the fight scenes boring because you already know the good guys are going to crush the bad guys. The anime makes me root for the bad guys because I want some sort of tension. When you combine a boring, emotionless, and overpowered main character, you get a slow anime to watch. The anime honestly gets worse each arc as you realize there will be no tension.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime was very weak, had an emotionless main character and had no tension which made this anime hard watch.

But this wasn't well made.\r\nThe story was okay. The idea to use weapons to use magic was a bit refreshing and to combine it with physics was also relatively good. But always those explanations why something works exactly this way and so on really bored me. \r\nAlso, I hated the characters. I hated them so much. The protagonist Shiba only cares about his sister and she only cares about him. I didn't want to watch a sci-fimagic anime for fucking incest. I had to cringe so much during the anime. And then everyone in the show thinks he's so cool while I could only vomit. With his \"super cool\" attitude, he makes almost every girl wet. The other characters weren't as unlikable as him but you didn't really care about them. For example Chiba Erika who SOMEHOW also has a brother complex. Just WHY? \\n\\n\r\nBut back to Shiba. He is the most unlikable character I've ever seen without being the villain. Well, they tried to make him seem less perfect because he wasn't that good in one aspect and that he has a weakness for his sister but otherwise he is just your average hero who always saves the day.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't listen to the opening or ending but the soundtracks were really bad sometimes. Some weird electro bullshit.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I really didn't enjoy it. I don't drop anime that often, especially not when I've almost finished them. But I just realized that I'd only torture myself if I continued watching it. So yup, dropped the show at 23/26 episodes.",

Can someone explain to me if that's a thing going on now in Japan?

I wouldn't say there was anything special about the character designs; let's just say they're aesthetically pleasing to the eyes. There's this one character (Miyuki) whose character design is quite generic, yet she constantly receives praise for her beauty (I still don't get that). Then we have Tatsuya, Mr. OP (he's seriously one of the most OP anime characters I've ever come across). He's such a badass though. Anyway, throughout the story you will meet interesting characters, each with their own specialty and powers. Theplot is quite interesting: it's set in an alternate universe in our world (alternate timeline), where magic is harnessed with the help of technology. The story focuses on a pair of siblings: Miyuki and Mr. OP, but other than that, the story isn't anything special (I would say one of the anime's weak points is how it handles the plot). There are a bunch of badass action scenes covered by Mr. OP in this anime, and there really needs to be a season 2 for this anime because there were quite a few plot holes. The soundtrack for this anime however is probably one of the most exhilarating and liveliest ones I've heard; a mix of electro beats, rap, and classical instrumentals that'll sure tickle your ears. This anime features quite an exciting world with an OP character, so if you're into OP characters, flawless fight scenes, and badass battle music, watch this anime. -flamingshitbag",

            "content": "I'm going to be honest here. I have no idea why this anime gets as many gripes as it does. I get that it excludes a lot from the light novel. I get that because of this the pacing is too slow and sporadic for the average shounen viewer. But some of the complaints I've seen just make me shake my head. I personally genuinely enjoyed this anime, and I will explain why.\r\nStory - 7\r\nWhile it has plenty of potential, I have no issues saying for those that read the light novel there are plenty of parts omitted to make way for the excellent lastarc in the anime. This can leave the viewer occasionally questioning various aspects of the show, I personally was able to grasp or understand well enough what happened, but I don't expect everyone to. In fact, I didn't even know that much had been removed from the show until I looked up the reviews for it. I checked what arcs were removed and read the summaries, and I really couldn't care less that they were removed. God forbid they don't insert the beach episode. \\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, I was kept interested nearly every episode. Even though the first arc is slow and contains lots of talking, I wanted to know more. More about the characters, more about our lord and savior Tatsuya Shiba (We'll get into that later) , more about magic, more about the world itself, more about the societal struggles faced in the show, more about everything.\\n\\n\r\nSimply put, for those that cannot stand sitting still and having to learn more about the world of the show, you just have to watch more explosions and action, and the protagonist getting up wiping blood from his mouth, spouting some line repeated over and over in the show related to friendship then barely beating his smug enemy with a massive OP move out of nowhere, this anime isn't for you.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, there are no filler episodes where the plot frustratingly just stops, the plot is always advancing, regardless of pace. Which I find fantastic.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8\\n\\n\r\nThe art isn't extremely stand out in the field of anime, however it is done fairly well, and I like the character designs well enough. Certainly, the art quality far exceeds shows like Naruto, where when I quit watching the characters seem to be made of play doh wearing clothes, vaguely resembling people.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9\\n\\n\r\nMy man, Iwasaki Taku. I love his work. The composer for this soundtrack was also behind other anime soundtracks such as Jojo's Bizarre Adventure: Battle Tendency, Soul Eater, and Gurren Lagann. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is extremely unique, containing Indian music, electro, jazz, funk, songs in French, and a ballroom dance song that contains some of the best English I have ever heard sung by a Japanese person in Vespertine Bloom.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 8\\n\\n\r\nThis is where most of the controversy happens. A lot of people accustomed to specific plot types and character arcs find the different directions the story takes unlikable. We'll start with the biggest topic.\\n\\n\r\nGod- er, I mean, Tastuya Shiba, is possibly one of the most badass characters in anime as of late, yet seems to get a lot of hate. This completely baffles me. He is not at all the typical anime protagonist, nor is he a \"Gary Stu\". The anime doesn't try to make him some relatable everyman learning about how the world works and being dragged blindly through the story along with the viewer, nor does he showcase any other tired and worn out protagonist cliches. He is, refreshingly, a totally competent, logical, dignified, polite, socially adept, and obviously a hilariously broken individual the anime doesn't really try to downplay or hide.\\n\\n\r\nIt seems a lot of people just wanted another anime where the same boring cycle of \"most powerful bad guy yet shows up, wins for 95% of the arc, but then through BS gets defeated by the protagonist just barely.\" Rinse and repeat. No, Tatsuya ignores that by just being awesome. And his OPness isn't from the writers just being lazy, there are very obvious plot reasons that will likely get thoroughly expanded upon if a season 2 comes out. \\n\\n\r\nOne thing some viewers didn't seem to wrap their minds around was the results Tatsuya had in his practical skills test at the very beginning of the anime. \"Why are they so low, this is just some lazy way to pretend that the main character is flawed.\" I respond by saying not at all. It has nothing to do with making Tatsuya seem flawed. Instead, it is to further establish on the idea that the society they live in is flawed and uses narrow-minded tests to measure ability and competency, resulting in genuinely talented people being regarded as average or less. Sound familiar? Tatsuya, due to plot reasons, is extremely unbalanced when it comes to his abilities with magic. He is completely unable to use some forms of magic, and is extremely proficient in his own unique abilities. So it is completely believable that he couldn't perform well in a test such as that.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, moving onto another character, Tatsuya's younger sister Miyuki is probably one of my bigger issues with the show. She is completely infatuated with her \"Onii-sama\", to where it seems to dominate her character. There are implied reasons for this, and we will get an explanation for it in season 2 of the show. Aside from that, she just seems polite and mild-mannered despite her absurd amount of magical power.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast is decent and has some interesting foundations for development in the next season , aside from maybe Mizuki at the moment, the shy glasses character, but that is more likely just because I am worn out on that character stereotype. Some mentionable side characters for me are Erika, Mikhiko, and of course, Mayumi. Mayumi, in particular, is a character I like. She is logical, intelligent, and an excellent leader. It is nice to see an intelligent female anime character that isn't also just monotone and matter of fact to communicate how smart her character is.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9\\n\\n\r\nI feel I have spoken enough on most aspects of the show, and it is clear I enjoyed the experience greatly. If one isn't wanting cookie cutter stories and characters (once again, aside from Mizuki), then I think enjoyment can be had a plenty watching this show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- 8\\n\\n\r\nI encourage those that watched it and disliked the OPness of the main character to re-evaluate the plot elements in the show and try to deviate their mindset from typical shounen archetypal stories and characters. I legitimately like this show, and think it is worth watching for those not wanting just explosions, maybe some story as well.\\n\\n",

I watched this show assuming it would be one of the best slices of bread you can get from the anime culture as some people tend to talk about it a bit, however I didn't find the hype of it most of the time.\r\nStory 5/10:\r\nThe story has a cool concept a future where the world relies on magic high schools to train magicians for war. The story is a bunch of arcs the first being an introduction to the 20 or more characters in the first 2 to 4episode. This one section of the story focused on introducing so many characters that is took over most of the first few episodes. The second arc is a magic competition between magic schools. This part would have been a lot more interesting if eight episodes of it did not feel like filler. The last arc which I will not say for spoiler reasons was actually good and worth watching. The series did have some epic moments that I thought where pretty awesome however most of those do not happen for the second half of the series.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10: \\n\\n\r\nThis anime had some of the most beautiful animation I seen in an anime. This includes the magic animations and the animations for effects like fire and ice. There are some 3D animations as well which where done pretty well. The only problem I have is some of the censoring in certain scenes where stuff gets really violent however I cant say anymore about this with out spoiling the show so I will leave it at that for the art.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10: \\n\\n\r\nThere was no music other then the openings that really got to me. The usual background music is usually instrumental while the other half of the music is a woman singing really fast while rock rythms play.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 6/10:\\n\\n\r\nI mentioned how the first arc was pretty much introducing 20 characters, the problem with this is that you tend to easily forget that many people very quick. They do try to develop them later but as the viewer you would not really get to attached to character unless they do something memorable right after they are introduced. When I ever watch a anime I tend to remember the names of 90% of the characters but for this show I cant. The good news is that there where some characters that I liked but that was only in the second half of the show. \\n\\n\r\nI want to talk about the main character Tatsuya who you can call pretty much a god considering how OP he is. I tend to really like the OP characters but this guy its complicated. He is literally in my top five most OP characters  but that is all there is to his character. He is metaphorically a blank slate that has been drawn on slightly and given the powers of god. He is set up to be a flunky in the school but he can do in reality the most metal things possible. Any thing interesting about or gives him any character like his past is thrown out the window leaving the slate uncompleted.  There was a lot of opportunities to make his character more likable but they blew it. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 5/10:\\n\\n\r\nThe last arch was really good but the slow pace of the competition arch really reduced the enjoyment factor out of the show. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall 6/10",

            "content": "The irregular at magic high school, better known as Mahouka, is a well produced anime. It's a much more standard Shounen anime than I first thought, and you could easily place it with recent anime such as Tokyo Ravens or Accel World.\r\nGood:\r\n+ Magic system is interesting. So broken that it's not.\r\n+ Large cast of characters.\r\n+ Decently paced. Doesn't drag on to fill the animation budget.\r\n+ Drama is kept to a reasonable level.\r\n+ Characters aren't dying left and right.\r\n+ Leaves room for a second, and/or third season.\r\n+ Relatively unique concept of magic\r\nBad:\r\n- Shiba siblings aren't well explained nor explored.\r\n- Characters aren't dying left and right.\r\n- Magician's\"mana\" limits are ill-defined. \\n\\n\r\nUgly:\\n\r\n-- It's a standard Shounen series in disguise.\\n\r\n-- Haters seem to really hate characters that are completely overpowered to the point of nigh-invincibility. (I say this only because Tokyo Ravens and Mahouka have a score difference of .09, but the top reviews for Mahouka are 7-3-5-7, and Tokyo Raven's top reviews are 8-8-7-8.) Don't people realize that main character's lives are only on the line at season endings? \\n\\n\r\nAgain, Mahouka is a standard Shounen. It doesn't have a mind blowing plot, it's characters aren't getting slaughtered by the dozens.  What really interests quite a few people is the premise. Sadly, the premise isn't the complete driving force of the anime. However, magic in the anime obeys it's own laws. And by it obeying it's own laws, I mean its overpowered in every aspect, especially those that are figureheads.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of overpowered, that's where our main characters come in. Shiba Tatsuya, and Shiba Miyuki. Technically they're the main characters, but they're quite dull. One is practically soulless, and the other has a Big Brother complex. Neither are particularly interesting, raw power is where they stop. \\n\\n\r\nThe redeeming aspect of the show is the large cast outside of the Shiba siblings. The student council is interesting, the Nine Schools participants are solid, and it just feels like many of them are people.\\n\\n\r\nI do recommend Mahouka, mostly because of it's magic. If you've done programming, it's like programming with physics, so some interesting concepts come up. The characters are likable enough, and there's enough action, plus drama doesn't swallow up the show. I'm looking forward to the next season",

            "content": "Overall impression:\r\nThose series have some sort of a slow and relaxing feeling to them (despite having violent scenes), and most of the time can be described as \"okay\". Aside from few episodes near the end, where this anime tried to be something that didn't make much sense, most of the episodes are \"alright\". They aren't dull, aren't annoying, but aren't very exciting either.\r\nCharacters:\r\nMain character is overpowered. Due to his personality it isn't annoying (because he's just very strong, but not perfect), but in those few episodes near the end there are few somewhat ridiculous scenes.\r\nMost characters are somewhat faceless, although there were few interesting ones.For example, I found Chiba Erika interesting. Interactions between characters usually are somewhat \"flat\", although there were few scenes that were somewhat enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nSomeone spent a LOT of time creating theory of magic for this setting. Most of the time anime looks like a long overview of the world with magic in it. That's where the anime works. However, when this anime tries to get more dramatic, the story stops being very believable. Over course of story, anime picks few important topics, and then sorta just forgets about them, apparently after being distracted by main character's power. \\n\\n\r\nStory consists of multiple arcs and they're all very long.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nNothing outsanding there. Character faces are standard triangular low-detailed faces that are used in the modern anime often. The art style doesn't have any unique personality to it, although I found few side-characters interesting visually. The anime uses anime-stylized CG models on some occasions, most of the time for background crowds, but in those few weaker episodes near the end I mentioned, there are scenes with obviously not hand-drawn objects and characters, and they don't look too well in movement.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nMusic in those series is disappointing. Nothing in soundtrack stands out, and on few occasions it gets slightly annoying and somewhat disruptive to the dialogue. \\n\\n\r\nBottom line:\\n\r\nI'm not sure if I'd recommend it. Due to slow pacing and methodical explanation of the world and its magic, it can be a decent show to kill time (most of the time it isn't dull or boring, but not exciting either), but ultimately there aren't many memorable things about it.",

            "content": "I would like to write a short review to provide my opinion of this anime.\r\nTo begin, this review is based purely on the Anime itself as I have not read the Light Novels. Furthermore while I will avoid spoilers, I cannot provide a review without some references to the story.\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n1. Should you watch this anime?\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n- The protagonist is powerful, so if you want to watch a power creep punctuated with hard fights this is not the anime for you.\r\n- If I were to categorise this anime I would say that it is a story anime with battle undertones, so it would be best suited toviewers willing to explore the universe.\\n\r\n- If you like that moment in animes where the cast see the protagonist's new power and are impressed/in awe, you will probably like this.\\n\\n\r\nSo, I would strongly recommend this, but feel free to read on if that doesn't convince you.\\n\\n\r\n2. Some analysis on the anime.\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nThe main aspect of the story that some will hate is that the main character is powerful. While he is only evaluated as a 'weed' or 'irregular' when entering school we discover that this is due to the assessment being unsuited to his skills. The story does not see the protagonist power up, or train to overcome problems since he is alrady more than capable, instead we are gradually introduced to what his abilities are, how and why he has them and where he fits into the universe.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the cast in general. They are brought to life by great voice acting, artwork, and their interactions throughout the show, with occasional references to their past to help explain certain traits. There is very little use of flashbacks or timeskips to explain the characters which means that it will take longer for each character to be explained through the story, but since you don't get pulled out to see the past, you are much better immersed within the events.\\n\r\nOverall I found that the supporting cast felt like a group of individuals I could really get behind, and found myself remembering names, traint and backgrounds much more than other anime's.\\n\\n\r\nThe story while being critisised by some reviews, was actually highly interesting and well developed. The integration of magic as a science and the detail that the show goes into to explain it was new and interesting. The gradual discoveries about the lead characters background provides an underlying storyline. While the individual story arc's work well to introduce the charaters and further the backstory.\\n\r\nThe progression of the story is primarily based on dialogue, though it didn't feel slow as the interaction between the characters was often valuable in either explaining the universe, story or providing insight into a charater.\\n\\n\r\n3. Overall opinion.\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nI loved it and have now watched the series multiple times.\\n\\n\r\nI tend to get emotionally invested in whatever I watch, so I love it when things go well. As such I found it refreshing to have a main character who didn't get his ass kicked in every fight.\\n\\n\r\nThe fights while largely one sided were interesting and displayed a balance between what Tatsuya could do, what he shouldn't do, and what the cast saw him do. Which provided a pleasant change from the common theme of repetative struggle and training.\\n\\n\r\nFor me the second best bits in the anime are the times we discover more about the lead characters, with the best bits being the interactions with the cast where they gradually discover how powerful Tatsuya is, and his position outwith the school.\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n-I would also mention this is not an anime with much 'fan service' though some dialogue will hint at such things, and there is some infrequent mild nudity.\\n\r\n-The show does use some hits at incest, though this is purely in dialogue and mostly to embarrass members of the cast for humerous effect.\\n\r\n-There is violence, mostly gore free with rare scenes of blood as part of dismemberment.",

            "content": "I decided to watch this anime because I once looked up best anime fight scenes on YouTube and found one from this anime. One of the best fight scenes I've ever seen, good enough to convince me to start an entire 26-episode show. However, some caveats.\r\nAfter seeing majesties like FMAB, Code Geass, Hunter x Hunter (2011), etc. this was disappointing. The relationship between Tatsuya and his sister is interesting, although a bit unnerving in that Miyuki loves her brother as more than a brother. Still, the fight scenes (magic) are good and the concept of building a society around magic as a technology is intriguing.The sound wasn't anything special, kinda annoying actually when listening to it separately. The character development of Tatsuya, an insanely powerful magician, is pretty awesome, although not as awesome as Ichigo's or Naruto's. It was pretty enjoyable, but not addicting. I would only recommend this if you are interested in the high school genre, magic with magicians genre, or are a serious anime viewer and want to see them all.",

            "content": "Alright, so right now you are probably thinking: \"Hey, isn't this that show where the main protagonists are siblings and in love with each other and there's incest and sh*t?\". And I can't deny it, you are right to some degree. But there's also so much more to this show that a lot of people seem to just gloss over, so in this review, I'll be attempting to explain why I found Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei to be as enjoyable as I did.\r\nNow, a very important thing to note when it comes to this show, is that it's not for everybody. If you are thetype of person that absolutely hates overpowered characters, turn around right now, because this show isn't for you. In order to fully enjoy Mahouka, you as a viewer have to come to terms with the fact that our main protagonist, Tatsuya, is literally God in human form. This guy doesn't know the definition of the word \"lose\", as he has never lost in anything ever. This is the type of guy that goes 32-0-12 in League of Legends and singlehandedly carries your entire team to victory like its nothing. As long as you can accept the fact that Tatsuya = God, you are good to go.\\n\\n\r\nThe second point I'd like to touch on is the topic of \"incest\" in this show. Our godlike protagonist just so happens to have a little sister, who (of course) is madly in love with him. Now, where other shows like to use the excuse of \"they are not related by blood\", this show wears its incest coat with pride, clearly stating that they are biological siblings and still in love. I'm not gonna lie, this kinda rubbed me the wrong way initially, as I just found their relationship to be incredibly weird, especially considering that they are LEGIT SIBLINGS, AND THIS KIND OF LOVE GOES WAY BEYOND THAT WHICH IS NORMAL FOR SIBLINGS. But after getting into it, you start to realize that their incestuous relationship really doesn't mean a whole lot in the larger scope of things, as there are only a few scenes in the entire show where the creator really points out the fact that yes, they are siblings, and yes, they are indeed in love. It's really up to you whether you think this kind of relationship is okay or not, and whether you are willing to tolerate it.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, where this show really starts to shine is in its worldbuilding. You see, magic in this world is more akin to that of science than the traditional wizards and spells. Each magic \"spell\" is built up sorta like a mathematic formula, where long components have to be correctly put together in order to perform actual working magic. Its obvious that the creator of this show really wanted you to learn about his type of magic, as a good deal of time is spent explaining the different magic spells and how they work. This can get quite heavy at times, with exposition-heavy dialogue that carries on for tens of minutes just to explain what it was you just saw. If this kind of thing turns you off, I would not recommend picking up this show, as you will quite simply be bored out of your mind.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: Now, with all of that said, I still found Mahouka to be a genuinly enjoyable show. Its entertainment value is simply through the roof, and I often found myself thinking \"damn, that was so badass\". In a world full of weak male protagonists that needs to be protected, Tatsuya really stands out as the \"alpha dog\", as he is pretty much the human incarnation of the phrase \"1v5 me irl bro\". If you are looking for a deep show with rich psychological value and philosophical thoughts, you are better off elsewhere. But if you are looking for a show where you get to see a human God fight terrorists and other threats with magic, this is exactly the thing for you.",

            "content": "The Irregular at Magic High School. As the title is relatively long, it can mislead people into thinking it's one of those garbage anime *cough-ICouldn'tBecomeaHeroSoIReluctantlyDecidedtoGetaJob-cough*, but that sure as  hell didn't stop me from giving it a shot. And honestly, when I started watching it the first time around on Netflix (which, by the way, is scheduled to remove it from netflix entirely in about...less than an hour at the time of writing this, give or take), I didn't exactly hate it, but I wasn't too fond of it either. If I could remember why, I'd talk about it...but I can't, so...sorry.\r\nAnyway, at thetime, I left off at the dead-beginning of episode 10, and didn't get back around to finishing the series until literally 3 days ago, at the time of writing this. The only real reason I finished the show this time around was because of the removal that is about to happen on January 1st from Netflix. In other words, I felt pressured to watch it. And when I DID finally finish it, I came out of it speaking this quote, \"Not too bad.\"\\n\r\nThe first episode began by being rather blunt. And this was a consistent pattern I noticed throughout the large majority of the show. More often than not, people like Tatsuya Shiba will be like (and I'm paraphrasing here), \"Get to the point, spare me the details.\" And while, yes, I get that it's the whole point of his character, it just made him and many other characters so very bland for the main protagonists of the show.\\n\r\nThe plot revolves around Tatsuya and Miyuki Shiba, a brother and sister who both got through their entrance exams for Magic High, but Miyuki, the self-proclaimed \"weaker\" of the pair, ended up getting a far higher score than her older brother. As such, Tatsuya is put into a category of students called weeds, whereas Miyuki gets to be a bloom, and student rep. Beyond that, however, the ending was subpar, at best. The most emotion I got out of it was the final discussion between Masaki Ichijo and his closest partner, Shinkurou Kichijouji, and even then, I was barely fazed.\\n\r\nTiny spoiler: Even if Tatsuya was very by-the-books, his inevitable bromance with Masaki Ichijo was actually really interesting to see, especially considering the fact that Masaki had a major crush on Tatsuya's sister. It was also pretty cool seeing Tatsuya being so accepting of the relationship between the three of them. I was initially expecting the two young men to have a blatant hero-villain sort of setup to them, not much unlike that of Vash & Knives in Trigun. I was happy to see I was wrong. Not that it's a bad plot twist, but it would've felt like they stole the plot somewhat from Trigun.\\n\r\nIn summary,  I felt like this anime was enjoyable, but sooooo bland.",

So slow that a snail would like sports car next to it. Also there are hints of an incestous relationship between the 2 main characters, though one could bear it to a certain degree, it is just plain weird. So if don't like stuff like that, this anime is not for you. Also this anime sometimes has a harem feel to it too.\r\nSo, my recommendation is to watch this if you want a strong protagonist, good for you.",

            "content": "There was this school that I really wanted to get into.  Around the time the decision of that school was coming out, I was watching Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei (Mahouka from now on).  After around five episodes, I thought to drop it.  However, because I really wanted to go to this school, I made a promise with myself to God: if I got into the school of my dreams, I would watch the rest of Mahouka.  I know, I know, that\u2019s pretty dumb; why the hell would God care about me watching some random anime?  As it turns out, Igot in.  Because I didn\u2019t want to incur the heavenly wrath on myself or anyone I care about, I decided to watch through the rest of Mahouka.  After finishing, I realized that this actually was a fair trade between God and me.  Watching this show was actually a huge price to pay.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I would rather do work than watch Mahouka.\\n\\n\r\nThe show has good production value, as expected of Madhouse, one of the best studios in the game.  However, not even Madhouse can salvage the trash story.  Mahouka depicts Tatsuya during his time at First High School, a high school for magic users.  He\u2019s been put into the second level, \u201cno talent\u201d student pool.  However, as it turns out, Tatsuya is perfect, in every sense of the word.  He gets all the girls, is wicked smart, has the best physical fitness and combat ability, and is crazy gifted in magic (despite what the show might say in narration or dialogue).\\n\\n\r\nAt first, the story sounds pretty cool.  After all, who wants to keep watching stories about people rising from the bottom to become number one through determination?  Some variety is always welcome.  However, as a result of this characterization of Tatsuya, the story wrote itself into a hole.\\n\\n\r\nThere is literally no tension in Mahouka.  At the beginning of each conflict, the villains are introduced, and they always look stupid.  Looks might be deceiving, but in Mahouka that\u2019s not the case; all the villains actually are stupid and weak.  Not only that, they are so one-dimensional that it\u2019s impossible to sympathize with any of them.  The result is that conflict does not actually exist in this show.  A \u201cproblem\u201d shows up, Tatsuya is dispatched, problem is solved easily.  \\n\\n\r\nIf there is no conflict, there is no reason to care.  Terrorists?  Walk in the park.  Mafia?  LOL.  All are powerless before Tatsuya.  What the writer could have done to fix the story would have been to create a problem that Tatsuya could struggle against.  That way, we could feel tension.  That way, we could watch episodes without falling asleep.  That way, this show wouldn\u2019t suck enough to be a price that a deity would ask for in exchange for a wish.\\n\\n\r\nWhy doesn\u2019t the writer do this?  It\u2019s because Tatsuya was created to be the pinnacle of wish-fulfillment.  He has to win everything, every girl has to fall for him, and every problem must be solved by him.  While being perfect, Tatsuya also has no personality to speak of.  Tatsuya, in other words, is a slot where the audience can insert itself and pretend they are him.  Creating a problem he cannot solve would contradict the entire mission of this show.  The writer doesn\u2019t create a good villain because he cannot.\\n\\n\r\nThe fact that a show completely devoid of substance managed to attain this level of acclaim is alarming.  We need to worry about the people that like this stuff; maybe their lives aren\u2019t very fulfilling.  If this describes you, go do things with people!  It\u2019ll be fun, I promise.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the irony has not been lost on me.  I mentioned that God was the motivation for watching Mahouka.  I also described Tatsuya as the perfect being.  So maybe Tatsuya is God?  Maybe he rewarded me for watching his show.  We\u2019ll never know, but just to be careful, I didn\u2019t say anything bad about Tatsuya in this review\u2026just in case.\\n",

The main protagonist in the series is one of my favourite male anime characters because of his emotionless personality and unbeatable ability. The series has a lot of action sequences and is very enjoyable to watch. The use of magic in this series is very unique on how they use it with \"Magic Sequences\" to power weapons. The soundtrack of the series is also something to admire, along with the art style, clothing and magic sequence designs. If you enjoy magic battles in schools with school magicrankings you would enjoy this anime, I personally did. \\n",

All I'll say is get ready because im on a roll today. (SPOILER ALERT THERE ARE MANY BELOW!)\r\nSo when I started watching this anime I was a bit turned off by the art style itself, the main characters are hardly memorable in the way that they look and sound. After I put a couple of episodes under my belt Ibegan to see how bad this was going to become so as a result I turned not to expect much from it and I'll say that from that point on, the show actually surprised me with how good it was in comparison to my expectationsSo let's start from the beginning of the anime, at episode 1 they show how magic originated and the first episode as is common for most anime is just backstory, alright from episodes 2-6 this is when things just become monotonous, they drone on and on about magic sequences and different forms of using magic and the main character's pistols being special and how all this stuff is going on, but in truth... They don't actually explain what you need in order to completely understand the show.\\n\r\n*this is a part where I'd like to mention I'm doing one arc of the story at a time, the first So resuming,being the Competition Arc the second being the Thesis Arc.\\n\r\nFrom there on out the story falls into a competition with the other Magic High Schools (nine of them total.) and this arc in general just serves no purpose whatsoever except for maybe some additional character development that in general is completely useless since the character development is HORRENDOUS in this anime. all-in-all I had fun with it but it's very incoherent so it's a general no-go.",

Also I liked the godtsuya / Miyuki sister brothercomplex (gave me couple of laughs). Art was pretty good, music was normal, thought I like the first intro, characters were not bad, but the story and plot plus delveloppement was a bit confusing for me, since I wasn't too concentrated when I was watching this  show.

Instead of calling him onii-chan like any normal imoutos out there, she called him onii-sama with full respect and obedience. \r\nShe never calls her brother \"baka\" or flying kicking her brother like those hordes of tsundere imoutos out there. So it make me think that her brother must be a no-brainer, breast-groping, skirt-peeking, panty-sniffer, onsen-peeker pervert who have no other purpose than making this series into a full-blown ecchi series.\r\nBut I couldn't be more wrong, becausehe is a genius, cool, dependable but can be cold and unfriendly most of the time but knows how to avoid others from feeling offended by his superiority in knowledge and skills.\\n\\n\r\nI have watched a lots of ecchi series, so personally I want to find a series where the male protagonist who is actually strong and capable of great things on his own instead of just relaying on his harems to boost his power and occasionally by unintentionally molesting them on daily basis. XD\\n\r\nI like how the female characters in this series have their own preference to the guys they like instead of all the girls in the school is crazy over the lead male protagonist like they were subjected to mind control of some sort.\\n\\n\r\nSo, after finished watching this series I can proudly say that I got what I want. Even though the 1st half of the series is kinda boring (especially the girl's competion), but as soon as the REAL VILLAIN makes their appearance, the story become more fun with more fight scenes.\\n\r\nFanservice-wise, this series have little of it. No onsen episode, no beach bikini episode watsoever! Or did I missed it somehow? Nevermind that.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the art, which I rated 6 because it failed to amaze me but it is still acceptable. The character design is okay but the surrounding environment, weapon design, the clothing design and the fight scene graphics is kinda LAME and BLAND. When I finally get to see the suit Tatsuya wear in action, I instantly recalled the CRYSIS suits. Compared to that, Tatsuya's suit look like shit to me except that it can fly and and not from alien origin.\\n\\n\r\nI totally looking forward for 2nd season and hopefully some OVA containing a summer beach bikini episode will be released. The girls in this series have a lots of \"potential\" that only a bikini episode can truly  unleash.",

I can't tell if I'm just not picking up on a ton of 'foreshadowing' or 'developing' they're doing between the lines, or if it's really all just filler actions and dialogue that add to nothing. \\n\\n\r\nI want to finish it because I'm just 3 and a half episodes from the end, and when I think about the premise and appearance of the show, it seems like a no brainer to do it. But watching it is a chore.\\n\\n\r\nI paused the middle of my episode to come right this review in an effort to 'take a break' without closing the tab of the episode. \\n\\n\r\nVery disappointing. On paper, this should've been one of my favorite shows. \\n\\n\r\nMaybe someday I'll try the light novels after a few more years of Japanese study.",

            "content": "This anime for me was one of the most refreshing and great anime i have seen in a long while. Why ,  because of the characters , the music and the story makes such an interesting combination that it feels new and interesting. First of all a character that i will admit is kinda OP i still loved it because of it. A Main character that start of as a great at what he does is so rare in anime that its sometimes a discovery in itself to find it. What has also made me like this anime alot is that i read theoriginal Novel which i will say gave me a greater understanding and also a greater love for the anime. The more i watched it the more addicted it became for me. And at the end the great music which made my body move as i watched the anime and exhilarated battles. \\n\\n\r\nThough i will say that if long explanation and slightly incestous pointers isnt your things i wouldnt say this is for everyone. And for some you might feel like something is missing or left out.  \\n\\n\r\nSo if you dont like long explanation , have a high limit on moral and hate when things are missing then it might not be for you. But if you love battles that almost make your body move in tune with the music. And like that the main character dont slip up on every turn until he finaly gets strong in the final episode then this deffinetly is an anime to watch. This is an anime which will show how great every character can be from start to finish but might leave you with a question or two but dont worry every anime has its ups and downs but i decided to review this because it had too many ups that the downs couldnt really strike it down much.",

            "content": "Warning This review may contain spoilers.\r\nFirst impressions, so we got an underdog story in the world where magic and science have fused into one. So this sounds interesting enough what could possibly go wrong?\r\nStory, 3/10\r\nIn a world where magic and science come together. Where a massive world war took place Which was not going to show you because that might be too  complex to show and care about good storytelling, How about instead we show you the adventures of a two siblings a brother named Tatsuya and his sister Miyuki going through magic high school, Which for some reason has a caste system inplace. That puts you in different classes depending on your magical ability instead of your actual skill or talent you may have. Basically what happens is are sibling duo take this test with the Little sister ending up in top classes known as the bloom with her older brother Tatsuya who is the main character being put in the weed cast. Who surprisingly possesses skills and knowledge that reach way higher levels than 99% of his  classmates even those who are bloom class are nothing more than mere pebbles when compared to him.\\n\r\nSo basically this try's to be some sort of underdog story that also trying to do a critic of some of the negatives of human society. Which on paper sounds like a good idea. But it falls apart when your main character is overpowered as all fuck and your content is about as shallow as a kiddie pool, Like why would you have a caste system in a  magic high school where everyone comes from powerful magical family\u2019s or have skills way above the average joe. So any student that would be going to this school  have already proven  that there a cut above everyone else and also if the goals of these schools are to train new magicians as weapons and etc then why wouldn\u2019t they just go like full  Meritocracy and just have the students  compete against one another  in various fields to find the best students and those who performed well get awarded and have certain privileges, that would have been better and far more effective for training  the next generations  of magicians. Instead of my magical ability better than yours reee so I going to be a one Dimensional asshole towards you. \\n\r\nAnd to top it all off add in a whole cluster fuck of overused tropes and clich\u00e9s from light novels In Till it becomes an unbelievable cringe-fest of epic proportions. But if you want to know the story contains I am happy to tell you. The story from about 5-6 episodes is about this school class system bullshit which at face value was kind of interesting and thought-provoking when I first watched it when I was first getting into anime.But when I stepped back and actually thought about it.I realized that the conflict is shallow. And that basically the same thing for every theme this show try's to do.\\n\r\nAt face value it all good and Dandy But when you look back and think about it.You start seeing these big holes in logic But back to the story. The rest of the story basically just, terrorist Attucks, school torments and a bunch of random shit that just isn't interesting or has any tension to it.Especially Because the main character can pretty much kill any threat in an in a split second without much effort. But To make my point more clear there is one scene where he gets shot straight in the heart and their blood everywhere. And I don't need to tell you that even if you live past a gunshot to the heart which is pretty much is unlikely to happen. You would basically die from blood loss if you didn't get to the hospital in time. What happens is that his sister gets rid of one of the limiters that holding his power back and he gets back up no problem at all even with the blood loss and during the end, he just goes full This is a featured article. Click here for more information. Page semi-protected Listen to this article Jesus-kun mode and blows up an  entire naval fleet in a few seconds so in honesty this show story has failed in almost every aspect it done. Calling it generic as an insult would probably be the understatement of the century. Even for an anime based on a light novel, it's horrid. it\u2019s almost like this series just wants to test the waters to see how little effort people you have to put into your series while at the same time making tons of money from your bottom of the barrel trash.\\n\r\nThe only positive I can actually list is that I think the setting is interesting. With how the magic works, the magic families and there politics and the how modern science and magic has become to this one thing.  Like the idea of magic and technology merging into this one thing is really interning idea and the whole idea of these magic clans, governments, or other terrorist factions battling each over to get a leg up over one another. That makes the world and the politics feel way more organic and gives the series some actual depth if they actuality focused on it.  But even that can't save face fully when it doesn't go in as deep as it should as what this series is adapted is mostly focusing on school bullshit and when it comes to the magic system they throw so much techno babe at you. That it really hard to get a proper footing when you\u2019re trying to wrap your head around this magic system. What would have been really cool is that instead of this high school bullshit, they could have turned this series into some epic global political thriller with various organizations trying to one-up each other similar to darker than black. That would have been cooler and way better than what we got.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters, 3/10\\n\r\nThe main character Tatsuya is bland as toast with no emotions because his family literally took his emotions away except for slight protective feeling for his little sister, basicity his family turned him into a sociopath. Which could have been interesting if they were using his character exploring and talking about the inhumanity of such individuals or what makes them tick and guides their moral compass. That would have been cool and deep, but no all we get is another soulless self-insert who kind of a nice-ish guy despite his sociopath \"testacy\u2019s\".  At least the show took the time to explain why it happened, But even the reasoning behind it was stupid. Basically, the main character had his emotions taken away from him Because from what is shown so far is that his family thought he would turn ageist the clan and kill them all of them because he was very powerful even as a young boy.  And I guess if you\u2019re a young child that is basicity a ticking time bomb of magical power and emotions then it would make sense why his family would want to try to get that under control or at least prevent the possibility to him losing control of his power and going themo nuclear on everyone asses. \\n\r\nBut the logic and reasoning behind it still fall apart, when you consider if he no emotions. That would means his mind is mostly running on a logos based  thought process correct, ok  So what would actually happen if it became logical to turn around and kill his entire clan in order to reach a certain  goal and  he has no emotions and dosnt even have a bound with 99% of  his family because of what they did to him and also the fact they treat him like dog shit, (even though he is handsome, smart, owns a very successful business on the side and is highly trained in various combat skills.)                                           \\n\r\nBottom line is that his clan are imbecile because if they thought taking his emotions away would make him easy to control and he never turns ageist them despite how they treat him they are dead wrong. Because of there such a thing as psychopaths/ sociopath who in laymen terms have every little emotions or empathy for others at all and have no problem killing people at all. and even though Tatsuya isn\u2019t really malicious in most of his actions. You cant forget the fact that in this series alone he has killed a lot of people with zero fucks given, grated most of the time it was in self-defense or he was protecting his sister, but who to say he won\u2019t turn around and do the same thing to his family. Also if he has no emotions then why the fuck does he actually invest time In combat training or anything for that matter. Because he would have to have some sort of motivation or passion to do that. Which he doesn't because he's a robot that will never become a real boy.\\n\\n\r\nAlso his younger sister Miyuki has to be by far the most annoying character in the whole show. Even more annoying than the one-dimensional assholes that populate the show like flies. She is basically then the only thing the Main character has a slight emotional attachment to and for some reason she has a brother complex. Which doesn't really make much sense because we find out that in the past even she treated him like shit in till awhile ago. Plus he has been an emotionless robot for most of his life. So Whatever speck of humanity that was in him is already long gone. I mean she would probably have a deeper relationship with a teddy bear than her robot of a brother.\\n\\n\r\nThe side characters are pretty much hollow shells with no personality or anything interesting about them. They are basically just so one note. There like background characters. Because every time I watch this show I have to remind myself that these characters actually exist. And when they talk about themselves or some sort of backstory. Its  like for me who the fuck are you again.\\n\\n\r\nArt, 7/10\\n\r\nThe animation was good, backgrounds are kind of average.\\n\r\nIt has some very bright colors which help add to the magic ability\u2019s that go on in the series It has some of the c.g.i Animation and considering japan tack record for CGI in anime this is quite imperative that it looks nice and doesn't clash with the 2d animation  The art style of generic as fuck.The characters design look so plain and hollow. It basically a copy and paste from most light novel series. \\n\\n\r\nSound, 5/10\\n\r\nThe op and ending songs I don't give a fuck about in the lest. the ost is ok as a whole. Nothing really good or bad about it. But I think it's ok to check it out. The ost was done by Taku Iwasaki who has done the ost for soul taker and black butler for example. When it comes to voice acting I felt everyone did an ok job distaste how bad this series is and the dialog is dry as toast.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, 2/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment or lack of enjoyment, in this case, I found nothing really enjoyable about this show. I found it a very soulless watch. it is one of worse shows  I have watched in my life And I would put this show in my top ten worse anime I have watched list. I am pretty sure I would have enjoyed this show more if there was personally or spirit put behind it, because of the world and some of the elements this show was slightly interesting. But it's hard to care when it every clear that the people to did this show had a gun pointed at their head.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall,3/10 \\n\r\nThere is no way in hell I would recommend this to anyone under any circumstances. Even my worse enemy's I wouldn't show this trash to them. If your new to anime don't waste your time on this show, Because you\u2019re going to look back and realize your wasted time. And that you could have watched someone else that you probably would have enjoyed ten times better than this. My advice just pretends this doesn't exist, Hell even madhouse who did the anime for this pretends it doesn't exist as well. The only reason I can see people watching this is that the music is passable and the visuals look very nice. Because story and characters are pretty much non-existent.\\n\r\nIf you like the ideas this series has your better of watching failed knight, a certain magical index or strike the blood.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I really liked this anime, but I understand that it is not for everyone. So what did I like about this that other people may not like?\r\n1. Shiba Tatsuya, the protagonist: If you do not connect with this character, you have little chance of liking this anime. The other characters are nothing special, and he gets the vast majority of the attention in terms of character development and close shots. \r\nHe is definitely not for everyone. Cold, unemotional, overpowered, he often seeks like he is just going through the motions of life, not really engaging in anything.\r\nWhat did I like? His lazer like focus ona single person was captivating. He didn't care if the world burned, he didn't care if people hated him. But he did care because if the world hated him, then that would reflect badly on his sister. \\n\r\nIn terms of overpowered, I don't think that it is as bad as other reviewers make it out to be. Most of the action here is him dealing with the limitations that are imposed on him, and overcoming those limitations, or breaking them. His greatest weakness is being unable to connect with the emotions of people around him, and one of the larger plot threads is how he manages to gain the trust of those people even though he has no feelings for them, which is about as impressive to me as it sounds. \\n\r\nThere is one more thing I like about this character which is more personal. I go to an elite liberal arts college, and try to find the very best and brightest there and surround myself with them. And so I am friends with some amazing people. I know people who just describing a list of their skills would be considered bragging, and so they intentionally hide their skills so that others don't feel inferior. I know people who care little about anything other than success and are willing to do anything to find that success. People who I have seen almost no emotion from whatsoever after years of interacting with them. So to me, Shiba is not this weird alien character, but in fact, a representation of these overachievers I know and love. \\n\\n\\n\r\n2. The technobabble: As this is a novel adaptation, there is an awful lot of technobabble. The characters spend about as much time talking about their magic as they do using it. Now, to me this is pretty great. After all, I am a computer programmer who likes discussing technical stuff. And it is decently well done, as good as I could have hoped for in an anime. But it really does take an awful lot of time, and is not fun to look at. \\n\\n\r\n3. The incestuous implications. The brother-sister relationship is much stronger than most, which I found fascinating and compelling, and crucial to the plot. But others might find it disturbing.\\n\\n\r\nNow,\\n\\n\r\nJust taking into consideration the above combined with the superb animation, etc, this could have a 9. But there were some serious flaws that I found lacking.\\n\\n\r\nWhat did I find lacking?\\n\\n\r\n1. The 9 schools tournament story drags on forever (11 episodes). From a story perspective, it seemed to me that it is a slow reveal to all the other characters that Shiba is amazing. They tried to show how Shiba and his sister's overpowering skills hurts some of the  people around him, perhaps exposing flaws? I didn't really get why this was so important. It takes nearly half of the anime, and since Shiba is my favorite character, and he has little development in this section, I was pretty bored. \\n\\n\r\n2. No backstory worth mentioning. I love backstories, and Shiba's was super incomplete.\\n\\n\r\n3. Side characters are not all that great. The only characters with any development or backstory are the ones who side with the bad guys. The other side characters are totally flat, and there are way too many of them.",

            "content": "Magic has become a part of technology and is hence taught as a type of technical skill. First High School divides their students into two types which they call \"Blooms\" (the \"express course\") and \"Weeds\" (the \"normal course\"). The show follows the Shiba siblings, Tatsuya (or Godsuya as I like to call him) and Miyuki.\r\nThe show was off to a fair start imo, but as it progressed, I saw no clear plot. Fights were all right, but they could have been much better. Especially the fight between Tatsuya and the one who could potentially be his toughest opponent in the show, which for me, lackeda lot of intensity and served as a major turnoff. There's also Miyuki, who can be really annoying with her constant \"onii-sama\"-ing and her seemingly incestuous dialogue. Music was all right. I personally liked the second ending theme, Mirror by Rei Yasuda.\\n\\n\r\nI think this show would appeal to people who would like an OP MC, some futuristic magic stuff and a little pinch of incest. Nothing actually happened though, just Miyuki's potentially incestuous and slightly cringy dialogue.\\n",

            "content": "I first got interested in this anime after I heard from several forums, reviews, and anime sites that Tatsuya was an exceptionally cool character and fell into one of the genres I liked.  After seeing this anime in it's entirety many times, I can say he is a very cool character.  The show hits upon many genres and does so seamlessly and very well.  The story is enrapturing without falling into the tired BS so commonly associated with Anime in general like the dozens of cliches and reused character templates.  It has great characters and though the author himself denies it,half the cast appears to have some form of Autism.  So maybe he created characters with Autism without realizing it but they pass muster for strong qualities befitting of the condition.  That is actually one of the reasons it is such a great show.  It is one of the few if not only times, Autism is not shown as a strictly negative condition but is shown in a strongly much more positive light than any other story, movie, or tv show I have ever experienced.  Wether they actually have it or not as the author claims they do not is irrelevant.  At the very least, they are characters people with Autism can very strongly identify with.  The explanations of magic are rather convoluted and sloppy and the strong hint of the bro-con sister gets a bit dull.  In fact, Miyuki is probably the worst and most annoying character in the show and the biggest drawback.  If the author were to ever somehow make them end up together it might well ruin the story completely, but thankfully so far that has not happened and hopefully it won't.  Aside from those few negative issues, the show is addictive to watch.  If you were into spies you would love all the secrets, undercover work, and hidden conflicts going on under the surface.  It has magic, hidden powers, high school, drama, espionage, war, mechas, and hints of love.  \\n\\n\r\nTatsuya is not omnipotent nor OP as many others would have you believe nor is he 'emotionless'.  His lack of emotion is an illusion.  If you read the novels especially, you will know he is more than capable of emotional outbursts that have nothing to do with his sister as the show claims the only emotion he has left is his sibling love for her.  The series and novels suggest several characters who can or have defeated him and several even Tatsuya is wear about if not fearful.  Mayumi is the perfect potential love interest even if Tatsuya doesn't know it.  She is without exception the best and probably most powerful of the main characters since Miyuki lacks much confidence anyway.  Erika is the next most significant character and one of the main sources of humor and social interaction among the group of friends.  Leo is probably the closest thing to a best friend and the first male friend his age Tatsuya makes.  Mizuki is not much different personality wise than Miyuki but a much better, more solid, and more stable character.  Miki is almost a male version but is still a better character who gradually develops some confidence in part to support the more meek Mizuki.\\n\\n\r\nLike many anime some important scenes are skipped or sped through so viewers may miss a few points but sadly this is very common in virtually all anime ever made.  This is an excellent hidden power show as several characters either hide from others, hide their powers, or hide their full or true abilities or even hide their identities.  There are many good 'ah-ha' moments, where your excitement is stirred by something incredible.  The last episodes has some of the best season ending moments ever.  The beginning maybe a bit slow but it does establish who is what pretty well such as when Mayumi is the first and only female who ever treats Tatsuya like a human and an equal from the get go.  (No his sister does not qualify, though it does not show it in the anime, it does have subtle hints, but until just a few years prior, Miyuki treated him like a worthless object so she doesn't get to claim true love even if she wasn't his sister).  Leo is the first guy to do that so, he belongs as his first and best friend.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a solid entertaining and enjoyable anime with a compelling and deep story filled with action, drama, humor, martial arts, and fascinating displays of magical powers.  What it gets right it gets very right: great action; martial arts mixed with magic; modern and ancient magic classifications; characters (except Miyuki); opening and closing songs (filler songs get repeated and tiring though); aha moments; use of magic; hidden powers angle; character development; the freshman monolith code event; and use of awesome powers near the end.  Only a few things prevent me from giving it a perfect ten and that is: Miyuki both her bro-con obsession and her subpar character; the show ended too soon and needs more episodes; long winded explanations of magical power and engineering; skipping on key components and backgrounds from the novels; and a few cheesy scenes like the ones between Mizuki and Mikihiko before the thesis competition.",

            "content": "To put it bluntly, the anime suffers from terrible characters, which impact the story severely to the point it's... not unwatchable, but you gain nothing at it and get really annoyed as to why you wasted your time after you finished the anime.\r\nAs a main character, Shiba Tatsuya is boring to hell. He does not emote, or show any emotion whatsoever. There's an explanation as to why he  does this, but you don't find out until the end, hell I'm not even sure that I figured out in the anime, I think i had to read the manga to get the full explanation.\r\nHis abilitiesalso rob the series of any conflict or challenge whatsoever because within the middle of the anime, I figured out that basically he'll pull some technobabble out of his pants and own the competition no matter how hard they tried. I hate to spoil, but the thing is... Tatsuya's disability isn't actually a disability. It's one of those blatantly stupid \"he's too powerful to do simple stuff, he has to use nuke powers and nothing else\". \\n\\n\r\nCombined with Tatsuya's bland character, the abilities he has writes out any meaningful conflict within the series. The series tries to say he struggles to do what he does, but he doesn't emote, so he never shows it. \\n\\n\r\nThis is not to say non-emotional characters are boring, but they need to be written better so that their lack of an emotion is an interesting conflict. Unfortunately, the Irregular at Magic High School has people throwing themselves in praise of Tatsuya despite the fact that... he's got the emotions of a robot, and is a bit of an arrogant jerk to boot.\\n\\n\r\nThe problems with Tatsuya as the main character extend to the rest of the cast, who embody basic anime cliches to the point that I sometimes find it difficult to differentiate the male members of the cast from one another as they often embody the same \"comrade/buddy\" cliche. His sister's characterization is even worse as she's portrayed as an emotional woobie, but a magical powerhouse... which would be interesting if she actually faced any kind of meaningful conflict her brother wouldn't just solve in two seconds.\\n\\n\r\nThese poorly written characters thus really don't do well for the story, which can't give a conflict that Tatsuya and his band of overpowered, bland, ensemble cast members can't solve without too much difficulty.  Thus the story... suffers.\\n\\n\r\nTo make matters worse, while the art is pretty good, the actions scenes... are not well-designed. The magic system they use is a technobabble system that relies on strategy/cunning rather than simple brute force.  But... it's so technobabble heavy nobody can understand whats happening and so it instead becomes an excuse for Tatsuya to make stuff up and own everybody. And yet, one can't get a good sense of how crazy this is because the system itself isn't really flashy, so no tension or sense of fulfilment is built up.\\n\\n\r\nAt their worst, fight scenes thus devolve into, who can spew more technobabble.  At their best, they're...people hitting each other with special swords or shooting each other with guns. Not particularly fun for a Shounen anime.",

            "content": "Irregular at Magic Highschool is probably the most infuriatingly incompetent anime I have ever had the displeasure of witnessing. Do not watch this. Just save yourself the pain and don't. Writing, story, characters, plot, animation, sound, every single part of this anime is mediocre to average, barely scraping an acceptable pass or failing entirely due to its sheer lack of trying.\r\nPretty much all that happens in the story is this, but three times: Some random terrorist organization with no clear or sensible motive but is set up as bad because they want to shoot people or whatever makes a stupid move to piss off themain character, main character strolls in and kills or captures everyone without any difficulties because he is a god, end plot arc. Riveting stuff, truly. Not even kidding, this same plot happens *three times*, just in slightly different ways. And yet, the presentation of this story somehow still manages to be janky and weird even with how basic it is. I often found myself confused as to why I was even being shown stuff. Many scenes could simply be removed and nothing would change, due to being completely pointless or introduced in such a confusing way or way too early so that you forget about them by the time they are relevant. If the story wasn't already lacking anything compelling, the writing is something a tenth grader could write, causing actions that are meant to make me care more about the story or characters to fall completely flat.\\n\\n\r\nWell, what if you want to watch for the characters? It's simple really, don't. Almost all of the characters, dare I say maybe even every single one, are forgettable and bland basic characters that have been boiled down to one or two simple personality traits, along with no character development throughout the entire runtime. None of the characters changed from episode one to the last episode in any meaningful way, they're all exactly the same. This is partly due to trying to handle too many characters, many got barely any screen time to the point where you almost forget they exist. The main character is the worst of them all, the writers were clearly trying *so god damn hard* to make him the most badass character ever, giving him way too many abilities, taking away his emotions so he seems cooler, and writing in a bunch of cheesy lines.\\n\\n\r\nInterested in the lore and universe? Don't watch for that either. The backstory makes barely any sense when scrutinized, as no explanation is given for any of the presented history and it doesn't hold up much to common sense. The world is pretty much just modern day, even though it's eighty years in the future with magicians, plenty of what is shown could be made today or *is* made today, this problem being especially prevalent in the beginning of the anime. But don't even get me started on the magic system itself. Every time they introduce a new spell or element they try and explain how it works, great right? Except every single explanation in this godforsaken anime is a bunch of technobabble nonsense using made up words that are never clearly defined. It took me approximately fifteen episodes to even have an elementary grasp of the simplest and most vital of the terms they use to explain every other phenomenon. Even then it's only a rudimentary understanding that still leaves you with no actual comprehension if you stop for even two seconds to try and figure out how any of this magic actually works. This is a huge over-arching theme with the explanations in Irregular at Magic, is that every single one is missing some huge key point that fits it all together, but without this piece, it all is just nonsense babbling filling the time slot. This is never fixed in any of the twenty-six episodes.\\n\\n\r\nAnother huge problem is how there is never any tension in the plot, as every situation is dealt with by some new ability of the main character that we haven't seen until now. And every time it happens, every other character is shocked because it is some top secret military tech or some new tech created by the main character. They then give one of those infamous technobabble explanations that don't really help you understand anything at all then move on. What makes the lack of tension or stakes even worse is that the enemies they face are almost all idiots, especially in the first half of the anime. Anyone who is not on the side of the main cast instantly loses about fifty IQ points. As well as that, anything that is thrown at the main cast is handled with extreme ease. Guns, mechs, tanks, bombs, everything is dealt with as if it was a marble thrown by a toddler. What is even worse is that by the ending episodes it has devolved to the point where even if a character were to die it isn't a big deal because we can literally just regenerate them instantly. Where are the stakes at that point? The most egregious part, and I cannot stress this enough, is how over-powered the main character is. He has so much power he is on the level of a god. The only thing that *might* stop the main character is fifty nukes all aimed at him. But even then it's not a guarantee. What do you even do when your character is so powerful that there is not a single scenario I can foresee where he would ever be defeated? There are simply no stakes at all by the time you know the full extent of his powers. Even before he starts using the full extent, he can still bring down almost anyone he wishes while barely trying.\\n\\n\r\nOn top of all the other terrible factors, the animation is simple and basic, the absolute minimum that is acceptable to look at all decent. It only barely scrapes by as looking okay, with the barest of movements for characters to look alive, even at the peak moments of the story. They also made the terrible decision to employ 3D CG throughout some of the more difficult scenes, and while I can handle a little use of 3D in the right places, they go overboard here. There is some truly terrible CG, but the true sin is how they went and used it for a major portion of the final few episodes, making what I assume are meant to be formidable mechs and interesting fight scenes look laughable.\\n\\n\r\nAudio work is also barely passable. The opening is extremely average and nothing new or special at all, and the background music often just sounds like a bunch of crap being mashed together. Need it to sound techy? Add in a bunch of annoying computer-sounding bleeps. Sports event? Add in some whistles or something who cares even at this point. There was never once a piece of music or sound work that actually stood out at all. It was all just passing.\\n\\n\r\nThe entirety of Irregular at Magic Highschool is the definition of aiming for a passing grade and not going any further. If you stripped the entire anime down to the most bare-bones form, then fleshed it out with good content, it would be fine. But that isn't saying much as instead, we are dealing with this trash heap. Everything combines to create a boring, generic, brainless piece of nonsense. There is not a single thing I can find to praise. Save yourself the time, and watch something better.",

Course 2 students, known as weeds, are the underperforming magic students. And Course 1 students, known as Blooms, are the overperforming magic students. \r\nThe story was good. It had interesting aspects that a lot of magic anime don't really have, such as the whole CAD thing, which makes casting spells faster and more efficient. The master clans was cool, I just wish they went deeper into it, because all they mentioned was that there were these clans which were run by differentfamilies. That's it. That's all there was. It sounded like a good start, but there wasn't much else about the clans. Magic is a favorite theme in anime. I love these types of things, since they don't happen in real life. The school system was a cool feature, but there were a lot of things that didn't stick in the overall plot, and were just there to serve one task, then were forgotten. Which was a little sad, but it happens all the time in short anime series, so I'll let it slide. Overall, the story was pretty cool.\\n\\n\r\nI wont go into art and sound, beyond the fact that they did it really well. I loved the colors, although it was overdone sometimes.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were Mediocre at best. There was a loli, a sister with a brother-complex and a brother with a sister-complex, A flirty manipulator who may or may not be the student council president, a loud mouthed girl with wild hair who is friends with a quiet girl, two quiet girls one who is most likely in love with the main character but too afraid to say anything and the other who is there to support the other quiet one, and lastly, to finish my point, a big guy who can be nervous, but stands up for others.\\n\\n\r\nI did enjoy it, besides all it's flaws. It is an enjoyable show, mostly later on in the series, but if you enjoy school anime, you'll like this anime early on. It does have a softcore incest type thing going on, but not quite fullblown incest. So you've been warned if you don't like that type of thing. The incest starts loud, then calms down, then gets out of control near the end.\\n\\n\r\nWell... I don't really know what else to say. I just finished the anime, and the ending was extremely disappointing. I won't say anything beyond that.",

            "content": "When I first saw this series, it peeked my interest, however I didn't get around to watching it for several months. A time came around when I had little on my agenda to watch, and so something brought me back to this anime, and I'm quite glad that it did. \r\nAs the anime progressed, I found that the more episodes I watched, the more interested in it I became. Seeing as how there are three main story arcs in this short anime, I would say that they get better and better. The first story arc was a little dull for my own taste and theaction only came in closer to the end. The second one got a little more interesting, and the third finally gave us that battle/war story line that had been hinted at during the previous episodes. \\n\\n\r\nThere are several reasons that this anime may be a turn off for some people, such as the very VERY strong and slightly uncomfortable relationship between the main siblings, the very quick escalation of sometimes rather grotesque violence, and the fact that there is little character development. However, the violence is in no way bad enough to be considered a horror/gore anime and let's be honest, many great anime do have that unusual sibling bond. As for the lack of character development in the main character, that is something which the audience just has to be fine with in order to fully appreciate this short anime for what it is.\\n\\n\r\nOne point of this anime I was satisfied with was the characters. Even though the number of important characters increased during the second story arc, each character had a unique personality to them (for the most part as far as the important characters go) that added to the story. Another aspect of this anime I enjoyed was the overall concept. The way that it was set in the future and used a combination of sci-fi/mecha with fantasy/magic was rather pleasing for me, seeing as how I have a hard time watching straight up mecha anime; they managed to combine the two in a successful way that made sense and didn't get too jumbled together. \\n\\n\r\nThe biggest downfall to this anime was the shortness of it. Unfortunately, shorter, more rushed anime are what is to be expected these days I find. When it ended, I found myself wishing that there had been more to it as I was still left with a number of unanswered questions. Watching the final arc, I found myself eager to get to the next episode, hoping for answers or further character development on some of the newly introduced characters, but found myself rather disappointed when the final episode came to a close and I had many questions still. The story to this anime had major potential had it gone further to touch on more aspects in further detail which makes me wonder about how much further the story went in the manga.",

            "content": "First of all before the review I would like to inform the two groups that (IN MY OPINION) watch this anime. \r\n1. I completely agree that this anime is definitely not for everyone and that this anime would have converging sides based on the persons interest as well as what they perceive the character to be.\r\n2. This leads to the two groups. People who actually really love this anime and would recommend it 10/10 and the people who may actually dislike the story due to a 'wasted' plot or just in there opinion.\r\nI however, am siding with the recommend side of this anime as Ihad so much fun watching it. In my opinion this story is great if you're looking for this total badass character who literally gives no S@!?. This perhaps may put people off due to this guy literally not losing, but I guess that this is why I like the character so much. I don't know why but I think this character is really likeable, has other great mains and secondary, which people may argue unnecessary, but I still like watching their interesting backstories as well as their development.\\n\\n\r\nWithout further elaborating, my second point is that the merging of science, technology and magic creates a great story. I think they can expand to zero limitations of their imaginations as well as the powers of every individual and the increasing plot and story lines. However, due to such a great explanation and foundation people may see it as a 'wasted' plot centred around a character who seems to have it all. But further on I still think this can be increased.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, to summarise I really enjoy this anime and for anybody who is looking for an entertaining anime to watch should definitely consider Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei. Thank you!\\n\\n\r\n-JanZPH",

            "content": "Story: The story is about a high school that hard to get into. You have to have some ability to get in. The anime shows that the school also has a segregation issue. The people that have high magic known as course 1 students or blooms and the other group with low magic or some other ability is course 2 also known as weeds. The vibe of the high school is blooms are better and should not be seen talking to a weed. The magic system in this anime works like a hash table. There a particular sequence of number that you would into adevice and that launches a magical attack. A person knowning what magical attack you are doing is konwn to be impossible (well except for the one character)\\n\\n\r\nThe focus is on two siblings. One is the younger sister. Who has lot of magical potential and since she was the best from teh entrance exam she gave the speech. She was placed in the bloom. The other person who did not do so well in the magical exam is a weed the older brother. The younger sister respect the older brother a lot. She knows that her brother is much better than any exam. His knowledge of magic is unmatched and how his magic is different from everyone elses. He also can read and know what magical attack you are going to do. Not only that but the brother is also super strong and agile. All of these make him irregular. SO the story follow these two going throug the magical school.\\n\\n\r\nRating time:\\n\\n\r\nPlot: This is interesting. The plot overall seem fine. You have a powerful character and you see that he is fighting towards a goal. The problem may be fixed with additional seasons, but as it currently stand there is a lot of holes in the anime. Like why are they put in this situatin, why are they like this. Why is he like that. Whose that. There a lot of questions. Secondly, there a lot of explanation. Like lots of it, there over explaning every little thing sometimes. The action part of the anime is great, but there less action and more talking it seem like, and I like talking anime but this one kinda took a point and kept talking about it and it like I get it. Please move on lol. I give this a 7/10\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: I think the animation of this anime is great. They quality seem like today type of anime. And it not even a ecchi anime lol. I give it a 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: I watch this anime in japanese dub. The voice acting was fine, I had no issue with it. The music and background music. I was fine with some and was like what for others lol. I would give this a 6.5/10 \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Introduction to characters were great. Character evolving, well the main character didn't really have a progression, it was mostly the surrounding cast that were accepting but that about it.The character past was done poorly, but maybe because they needed more seasons. Based on the information I have I would give this a 6.5/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall with bias: It wasn't a bad anime, it was a lot of explaining and you can get tired of this. I enjoy the fight scenes or scenes when they weren't explaining things. I think I would give this anime a 7/10. It might  be better in future season though.\\n\\n\r\nRecommendation: Hard to say. If you like the idea then you might like it and would recommend as long as you know there are lot of explanation going on in the anime.",
