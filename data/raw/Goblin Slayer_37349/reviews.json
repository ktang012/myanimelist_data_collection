Jesus Christ, just stop it.  Take your pretentious, Tatami-Galaxy-loving-ass outta here, so us real fans can enjoy the kick-assery that is Goblin Slayer.\r\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.No.  I\u2019m serious, leave.  RIGHT NOW!  Only true fans will have the pleasure of reading this phenomenal review.  Shit, if you gave this series anything less than a \u201c10,\u201d you\u2019d best stop watching anime altogether, you wannabe-otaku.\r\n \u201cSo, where are thegoblins?\u201d \u2014 Goblin Slayer\\n\\n\r\nThe genius of Goblin Slayer comes from its uninhibited objective to underscore the savagery of the goblins; thereby, forcing the audience to immediately empathize with the lowly adventurers who\u2019s virginities will be forever lost to those disgusting green chodes.  The first episode may have been a bit overwhelming, but it was necessary to highlight the evil nature of the goblins.  And boy, were they ever evil.  But when all hope seemed lost, the vigilante known as Goblin Slayer entered the proverbial arena, to lay-the-smack-down on all their candy asses.  And layeth-the-smack-down he did.  Essentially, if you think about, he\u2019s the Japanese equivalent of Batman \u2014 mother f\u2014king BATMAN, people \u2014 set in a medieval world.  It\u2019s f\u2014king awesome!  But instead of breaking bones and scaring his foes psychologically, the Goblin Slayer just straight up murders those little dick-wads.\\n\\n\r\nAlong with his ruthless nature, the Goblin Slayer utilizes a myriad of techniques to kill goblins and keep the viewer entertained, including: curb-stomping goblin teeth against jagged rocks; rearranging goblin face\u2019s with his knuckles; splattering goblin brain matter across cave walls; shooting arrows through goblin eyeballs; and performing a mass genocide of all goblins, including the young-lins (NOT THE YOUNG-lins!).  Also, the Goblin Slayer\u2019s battle armor looks amazing, and his sturdy resolve to remain a \u201cgoblin-slayer,\u201d despite the ridicule of his fellow (ASSHOLES!) Compatriots was admirable.  His heart is filled with a deep hatred for those vile creatures, and people calling him an \u201cedge-lord\u201d simply don\u2019t understand how traumatizing of an experience he went through.  If the anime community had any inkling of what empathy was, then they would know what time it is.  But the Goblin Slayer knows: it\u2019s f\u2014king goblin-slaying time!  Amirite.\\n\\n\r\nThe genius of Goblin Slayer comes from the formation of a great coalition of diversified talents and people to accelerate the slaying of even more goblins.  Simply put, they paired the Goblin Slayer with a lizard-dude, a flat-chested elf, a geriatric dwarf, and Onna the high \u201cpriestess\u201d to go on a super-cool adventure to destroy an enormous goblin nest.  When the elf-girl used her magic to guide the single arrow through the two goblins and a wolf, I was straight up marking out.  Woooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!  (Ric Flair style).  But the episode wasn\u2019t over quite yet, because just as my erection was at its limit, they started playing epic rock music as the main crew walked towards the Goblin den with bad intentions, enough weapons to terrify the whole country of France, and a whole lot of awesomeness.  Schwing!!!!!!  Party time, bitches!\\n\\n\r\nBut, alas\u2026.it\u2019 not all good, dear friends (friends only include people who have Goblin Slayer in their favorites list).  Episode five deviated from the norm, omitting the Goblin Slayer\u2019s main objective in lieu of a silly side quest by some arbitrary character\u2019s.  EXCUSE ME!  Are we watching \u201cGoblin Slayer\u201d or \u201cPummel a Rat With a Giant Club Because You\u2019re Too Incompetent to Pull Your Sword From a Dead Rat Carcass\u2026Slayer?\u201d  The show, obviously, lost its focus, leaving the viewer in a deep pit of despair, wondering if the Goblin Slayer would ever resume his normal duties of goblin slaying (#depressed).  This sort of blunder would have been unforgivable, if not for the following episode when the MOTHER F\u2014KING Goblin Slayer lit those goblins up like a Christmas tree\u2026\u2026.wi-with his sword (it makes SENSE!).\\n\\n\r\nThe genius of Goblin Slayer comes from the application of Sun Tzu\u2019s, \u201cThe Art of War,\u201d via the Goblin Slayer\u2019s willingness to think like a goblin (i.e. \u201cTo know your enemy, you must become your enemy\u201d); hence, why the Goblin Slayer used goblin blood to conceal his own scent and displayed an indifferent, callousness during his various killing-sprees.  In addition, his level of perception to distinguish between goblins and non-goblins was especially on point, rarely finding himself in a situation where he cannot fulfill his goblin killing responsibilities.  Developments throughout the series highlight the contemplative side of the Goblin Slayer, as it\u2019s revealed that the internal goblins inside his head haunt him \u2014 \u201cBullshit.\u201d \u2014 inspire him to become enraged and go on the greatest goblin slaying spree of all time.\\n\\n\r\nThe genius of Goblin Slayer comes from its beautiful blend of \u201chappy,\u201d vibrant colors of the real world, juxtaposed with the dark, bloodcurdling atmosphere of the real-er world.  The contrast exemplifies the duality of life itself and how transient bliss can be supplanted by life long despair, due to circumstances that are beyond our control.  The Goblin Slayer experienced a fate worse than death, having witnessed the gang rape and eventual death of his sister.  Instead of acquiescing to his own fears, the Goblin Slayer hardened his resolve, choosing to never forgive the creatures that robbed him of his remaining family and his innocence.  The Goblin Slayer, himself, is not an exceptionally powerful warrior, nor is he blessed with unique gifts/powers that elevate him to the status of being \u201cone of a kind\u201d (perpetuating the Stock Sh\u014dnen Hero archetype).  What makes the Goblin Slayer \u201cspecial,\u201d is his devotion \u2014 some may call it, insanity \u2014 to exterminate every last goblin in existence and make no apologies about it.  Just as Michael Jordan etched his name in history as the G.O.A.T with his unmatched competitive fervor, the Goblin Slayer\u2019s inexorable zeal to eradicate his mortal enemy, is an unparalleled intensity that instills fear in his adversaries and certitude in his comrades.  \\n\\n\r\nThe genius of Goblin Slayer comes from the tactical vision and strategic planning of the Goblin Slayer.  His ability to foresee goblin battle plans and construct effective countermeasures, validates his meticulous nature and his profound cognitive capacity.  While other adventurers were caught off-guard by the goblin riders and the goblin champions, the Goblin Slayer, in all his clairvoyant glory, ensnared the repulsive creatures with his superior traps and delegation of responsibility; thus, paving the way for his final showdown with the Goblin Lord.  A showdown, in which the Goblin Slayer harnessed all his rage and pent-up frustration to fuel his fighting spirit to its absolute maximum.  \\n\\n\r\nSo why, you may ask, does the community hate the Goblin Slayer?  Detractors have argued that the Goblin Slayer\u2019s combative fury embodies the worst aspects of the \u201cUnstoppable Rage\u201d archetype.  You know, the same \u201cUnstoppable Rage\u201d every Sh\u014dnen hero experiences when they lose their shit and unlock a dormant power they never realized they had, until that very moment when they needed it most.  In addition, they claim that the excessive amount of fan-service has been rather excessive.  Excessive or not, the fan-service has been a point, with a plethora of great camera angles and side boob action to boot.  Lastly, they assert that none of the characters exhibit a genuine personality, or display any growth throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, these are just words, with a sprinkling of even bigger words (so many words).  And are we really going to accept the words of a bunch of salty bitches who conform to groupthink psychology, to avoid being ostracized by the anime \u201celitists\u201d for having \u201cshit-tastes?\u201d  I think NOT!!!  Why is that?\u2026\\n\\n\r\nBecause Goblin Slayer is the hero the MAL community deserves, but not the one it needs right now, so we\u2019ll ridicule him.  Because he can bear it, because he\u2019s not a hero.  He\u2019s a stoic defender, a warrior-savant, an ardent gladiator, a competitive eccentric, an iron-clad inspiration\u2026.\\n\\n\r\na GOBLIN SLAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYEERRRRRRRRRR!!!!!",

            "content": "Another fun little romp through fantasy-land, quests to be ventured and gold to be reaped... or maybe not quite. \r\nWelcome to 2018's most controversial anime, Goblin Slayer. Little known by western anime fans, it came much out of nowhere, with a first episode that made viewers aghast and the social medias ablaze. And why, you may ask. I will have to leave that unanswered for a moment, as you should not yet be reading this review if you are unfamiliar with what scene I am referring to. But I will leave a word of caution: you should probably not watch Goblin Slayer if you areeasily disturbed. \\n\\n\r\nSpoilers of the first episode, necessarily, will follow. \\n\\n\r\nWhat transpires in the first episode overshadows everything that comes in the following eleven episodes. And so, this review will be centered primarily on the first episode and its resulting controversy. Though I will also be discussing the artistic merits of the anime as a whole, this will be as much a critical analysis as it is a response, an answer of sorts to whether the controversy Goblin Slayer brewed ever had any meaning in the first place. \\n\\n\r\nAnd, I will tell you, no, it really did not.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the second episode onward, a 'viewer discretion' warning appears in the subtitles provided by Crunchy Roll. But nowhere does it appear in the show itself, in Japanese. It is quite clear who was actually offended by this show... and it was not the Japanese audience, for whom this anime was made.\\n\\n\r\nI'm going to be quite blunt, as this perception that westerners' views are always, unquestionably important is bothersome. Japanese anime studios do not care about what English-speaking YouTubers have to say, for they cannot even understand them in the first place. They do not care about Tumblr, nor do they care about anyone except viewers in Japan who could potentially buy BluRay discs of their series. They are companies, not political organisations. They are from Japan, not from the United States. The only thing the west could do to make an anime studio utter more than a flippant 'oops, sorry' is to have a spot on CNN or some other giant television network, in the same vein as the infamous adult game, 'Rapelay'. So, unfortunately, if you think yourself a sort of champion of justice, destined to rid the world of all portrayals and even mentions of rape, in countries you have never even visited and which do not share your beliefs\u2014 then, sorry to say, your words have fallen upon deaf ears.\\n\\n\r\nIf you have ever played a visual novel, read adult-oriented manga or watched an R-18 anime (and the Japanese audience for Goblin Slayer most certainly has), then sexual assault, as vile and irredeemable an act as it is, is not particularly unusual or shocking. I suppose it may be shocking in the context of Goblin Slayer being a TV anime, in which these sorts of acts are seldom depicted. But you also have to keep in mind that Goblin Slayer airs past midnight on a weekend, well into the usual watershed hours of western television. Kids are not meant to be watching this in the first place. And sexual assault is not rare in late-night anime so much because it is 'going overboard', but because the anime community in Japan is obsessed with the concept of virginity and do not take kindly to their imaginary characters being touched by a man other than them. Hence, the reason for why sex is not so much as mentioned in non-erotic anime, whether it be consensual or not. If sex is not graphically depicted (i.e. genitals showing and thrusting and all), then it is, generally speaking, safe to air past midnight on Japanese television. Goblin Slayer's now infamous scene, unpleasant as it is to watch, was not especially graphic. It did not black-out and fast-forward to the end as most anime do, and so while this scene is not entirely innocent (true, it is difficult to not feel at least a little bit sick in the stomach), it is hardly the traumatic viewing experience that some claim it to be. Say, for example, \"13 Reasons Why\", a western Netflix series, was far, far more graphic in its depiction of similar subjects and yet it was extremely popular among western teenagers, particularly females. But when an obscure late-night anime aimed at a completely different culture, and with drawings instead of real actors, tries to tread the same waters? Take it down. Take it all down, they say. Right. Good luck with that one. \\n\\n\r\nI suppose the deeper question, then, is whether these scenes were actually necessary. I highly doubt these scenes were meant to be erotic, to arouse its viewers when they were preceded by a brutal stabbing and a brutal massacre. And the attempted rape that follows the first is abominable enough that it defies any and all human logic, clearly meant to invoke deep feelings of hatred for goblins rather than a boner-pop and an \"oh yeah, baby, show me more.\" Goblin Slayer showed these scenes to create a sense of danger and to make you root for the titular character's, uh, titular slaying of said goblins. And fair enough. But equally fair is the question of why they chose rape in particular, rather than some other wretched act that would make you want to see goblin heads hitting the floor. Hatred was necessary for the story to continue, but not so much rape itself. My guess is the author chose that route because other fantasy series such as Re:Zero have already done the same with violence alone. The author wanted to set their series apart, to invoke a sort of hatred that anime-only viewers have rarely or perhaps never experienced before, and, well, the result of that is laid bare for all to see: angry westerners, and Japanese fans who just want to see some dead-ass goblins.\\n\\n\r\nIt is not so much from an artistic perspective that I am defending the author's choice, however. Gratuitous and pretentious, it is, when what follows in the later episodes is of little importance and does not in any meaningful way make use of the hatred instilled in the audience. Rather, it returns to the exact same silly and carefree tone of the anime's opening few minutes, as if it what happened in the first episode was just some sort of dream. Heck, the second episode may as well have been the beginning episode\u2014 the first completely obliterated from existence\u2014 and little would change at all with regards to the story and the characters. Goblin Slayer does not contain much in the way of themes other than 'goblins suck' and 'revenge begets revenge', and the trauma the heroine experienced during her first encounter is hardly touched upon or even acknowledged afterwards. Indeed, after an experience that horrifying, you would expect the heroine to, if nothing else, be apprehensive about another goblin slaying adventure, but by the next day she gives almost zero damns and throws herself to the protagonist's side merely because he is tough and can protect her, I guess? A bit of an idiot, indeed. Other characters will casually talk about their traumatic experiences as the camera pans lustfully over their breasts... almost as if it is a joke, making it pretty well clear the anime has no intention of taking these issues seriously. How are you supposed to care for characters that don't even know how to care about themselves? In the end, the main thing that sets the rest of the anime (everything sans the first episode) apart from any other fantasy series is the level of blood involved. Goblin Slayer is a strong dude, the heroine is cute, and screw goblins\u2014 there you go, Goblin Slayer's deep themes interpreted by yours truly. \\n\\n\r\nIf a darker fantasy anime in the lieu of Berserk is something you are clamoring for (as, well, there really are not a whole lot of them), then Goblin Slayer is if nothing else a serviceable adventure. The titular protagonist, Goblin Slayer, is essentially a more calm and composed version of Guts from Berserk: taciturn, a dark past, filled with hatred and a desire for vengeance, armor and all... albeit with a sword a size that humans can actually wield. His cold but logical manner of speaking are refreshing in a genre that is largely defined by self-righteous protagonists spouting idealistic nonsense. Goblin Slayer will save whom he can, but he is also capable of recognising the limits of his power and putting those with mortal wounds out of their misery. He knows that fighting requires planning and a clear head just as much as it requires strength. An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth is his way of living, but he does not try to moralise his lifestyle, instead believing that his endless lust for revenge makes him just as violent and as brutal as the goblins themselves. He has a sort of awareness and intellect that most anime protagonists lack, which makes the desolate world he lives in feel just a little bit more authentic. But those who are not a fan of darker or more morally ambiguous protagonists will only find the anime more unappealing with his presence. \"Edgy\", \"pretentious\", others might say. Considering that one's enjoyment of Goblin Slayer is almost entirely decided by their interest in the protagonist, and consequently his goblin slaying journey, those who do not find these sorts of characters appealing are well within their right to dislike the anime as a whole. But to say he is dark merely for the sake of being dark would be something of a lie. No, he is dark because he grew up in an awful world with rapey, murderous goblins. \\n\\n\r\nConsidering the natural path for most fantasy anime is to gradually hunt stronger and stronger monsters, the fact that Goblin Slayer is perpetually chasing weaker monsters\u2014 goblins\u2014 and even being ostracised for it by his fellow adventurers, is a refreshing change of pace for a genre that is often so predictable that you can already guess the events of the final episode based on the first. Sure, those in search of climactic fights may find themselves bored with an adventure that stays at largely the same difficulty level for its entire duration (with the rare boss battle here and there), but then again, how many times does one need to see a big bad dude or a dragon slain before they are satisfied? While most anime increase the stakes as the opponents get stronger, Goblin Slayer is able to portray weak little creatures as menacing, something few anime do, slimes and goblins brushed aside as if it is a necessity. The issue is that Goblin Slayer, despite it having a clear, singular focus with goblins as the villain, never really does or say a whole lot with them. They are almost entirely identical to one another, existing to rape, kill or be killed and little else. When the antagonist of a story lacks a motive and a personality, it's kinda hard to care much about where things go in the end. \\n\\n\r\nGoblin Slayer is neither horrible nor is it great. And sometimes it is both. Putting aside all the noise surrounding the series, and looking at it as a piece of fiction like any other, what is left is merely a decent dark-fantasy anime. Its artistic merit is hardly comparable to its big brother, Berserk, and while there are very severe issues afflicting the show, in a season where truly abysmal, irredeemable rubbish such as \"Ore ga Suki nano wa Imouto dakedo Imouto ja Nai\" has aired, Goblin Slayer is not what I could consider a bad anime. There's enough of interest here with the protagonist and the setting that I am at least considering reading the light novels in Japanese, where perhaps things are a bit better explained. Those regarding Goblin Slayer as the worst anime they've seen are more likely than not fishing for attention by exaggerating their opinions as much as possible. Either that, or they have just not watched a whole lot of anime, I would have to guess. \\n\\n\r\nBut to say I am a fan of Goblin Slayer, or that I even liked it would to be as dishonest as saying I hated it. My defense of Goblin Slayer is my defense of the author's right to artistic freedom. Being offended by this show is reasonable. Using said offense to try and shut down an author's livelihood, or to generalise an entire country of 130 million people as perverts or as morally bankrupt, is not. Some may even say it is despicable. And, you know, I think there is some truth in that. \\n\\n\r\nSo, feel free to watch Goblin Slayer if you enjoy dark-fantasy and have a tolerance for uncomfortable content. Or skip it, because truth told, Goblin Slayer was never really worth caring that much about in the first place.",

            "content": "\"Psst, kid, wanna roll some D20s?\"\r\nGoblin Slayer is a series that, paradoxically, is underrated because of how popular it is. Popularity means a wide audience, which means a wide array of stupid uninformed opinions that undersell a good work of fiction. Here is a shortlist of wrong statement about this show one might hear, as well as where those statements originate from: \r\n\u201cIt\u2019s edge-fest/fetishistic porn/literally neo-nazi propaganda\u201d - originates from sheltered, entitled life without any hardships plus never reading/watching any serious fiction, thus having no context whatsoever for how a dark/whatever show looks like. Goblin Slayer is just an ordinary R-rated show.\r\n\u201cIt baits you withgore and then becomes generic SoL\u201d - from sheltered, entitled life without any hardships plus never reading/watching any serious fiction, thus having a warped idea that to be \u201cmature\u201d a story needs a character getting killed/raped/eaten every 30 seconds, \u201cjust like it happens in real life\u201d.\\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a generic isekai\u201d - from thinking SAO invented fantasy anime and not knowing such words as \u201ctabletop\u201d or \u201cD&D\u201d.\\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bad adaptation\u201d - from not even knowing what medium the source material comes from, and mistakenly believing it\u2019s manga. Between manga and anime, the anime is a better adaptation of the original light novels. Alternatively, from fundamentally not understanding how \u201cadapting\u201d from one medium to another actually works.\\n\\n\r\nBrushing the nonsense aside, I want to emphasize what makes this show good:\\n\\n\r\nGoblin Slayer perfectly captures the spirit of a D&D campaign - that is, the spirit of murder-hoboing, with all the glorious total party kills, rule-lawyering and cheesing of the encounters. You can constantly see deliberately written moments where the players are implied to be rolling the dice, and how good of a roll that was based on the outcome.\\n\\n\r\nIt is a well-written dark fantasy in a market where this commodity is in deficit. Many little details show that a lot of thought and research was put into world building. While it\u2019s not quite on the speculative fiction level, it comes pretty close to being a D&D setting written as a real functioning world.\\n\\n\r\nA unique and fascinating main character and his character arc. The premise initially implies that Goblin Slayer is going to be a faceless killing machine. He was born to be a completely unremarkable average person, but then a single event radically changes his life making him fanatically focus on a single goal (of killing goblins) in favor of which he abandons everything else, including growing into a well-adjusted human being. But that doesn\u2019t mean he isn\u2019t a human being, or even that he is crazy. The foundations to lead a normal life are there, and the more Goblin Slayer comes in contact with other people, the more he grows, becoming more and more complex and constantly re-evaluating what he is.\\n\\n\r\nGood adaptation. Not slavish adaptation, but actually good adaptation. Things are swapped around and changed to accomodate episode length and season length limitations, thus having a proper story arc in 12-episodes format. Between the things that are the point of anime medium - fight scenes choreography, music, voice acting - the former two are great. And while the latter is nothing to write home about, hearing Priestess say Goburin Sureiya-san is a reason enough for an anime adaptation to exist. Also, main character\u2019s model is CGI and it looks fine unless you hate CGI on religious principle, not based on how it looks. For those who desire faithfulness, the anime is more faithful than the manga, which has an annoying manner of randomly changing characters\u2019 reactions/behavior, therefore changing the characters themselves and making them look inconsistently written.\\n\\n\r\n9/10 because this series succeeds in what it tries to achieve with basically no issues.\\n",

You will be worse. Rip and tear, until it is done. \r\n- Intro Dialogue to Doom (2016)\r\nHaving watched Goblin Slayer in its entirety, I can\u2019t help, but be reminded of the video game Doom (2016). In fact, the quote above perfectly encapsulates what Goblin Slayer is really about. Killing, slicing, dicing, burning, piercing, bludgeoning, ripping, and tearing goblins apart. The violence is brutal and extremely gory. Our main protagonist, Goblin Slayer, will use any means necessary to kill as many goblins aspossible. During the first episode, he kills by himself, while keeping count, exactly 22 goblins. That\u2019s a lotta damage. And also a lotta dead goblins. But, to our main protagonist any dead goblin is a good goblin.\\n\\n\r\nGoblin Slayer is also a very controversial series. It goes without saying that violence and gory isn\u2019t what made this series so controversial rather it\u2019s \\n\r\nthe sexual content and rape. Within the same first episode, we have the gang-raping of a female adventurer and the molestation of another one. Future episodes contain implied rape and torture of many female adventurers. And while the series could have minimized these elements, I believe it adds to the setting and enemy characters, i.e., the world is dark and brutal, and goblins do terrible things to female characters.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, if you\u2019re like me, who only watches to see Goblin Slayer kick ass, then you\u2019re not going to be disappointed. In fact, I would argue that watching Goblin Slayer kick ass alone makes this series really entertaining and worth watching. Everything else be damned.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY:\\n\\n\r\nGoblin Slayer is a dark fantasy based on the light novel and manga of the same name. The series sticks to its source material and doesn\u2019t remove any of its ultra-violence and sexual content. It should be noted that this series is not a isekai, where the main character is transported to another world and does whatever shit the main character needs to do. There are no fun adventures in this series, just death and destruction. Mainly the death of many goblins and other creatures, and occasionally some adventurers. But, that\u2019s just the general setting of this world, i.e., it\u2019s dark, cruel, and merciless.\\n\\n\r\nIf I had to simplify the story, it would mainly be about Goblin Slayer\u2019s \u201cadventures\u201d, how one man elects to do only goblin quests, in order to satisfy his anger and thirst for revenge. And, of course, based on his adventures you can expect numerous goblins to be killed in the most brutal ways possible. In fact, he would go as far as kill goblin children because to him \u201cthe only good goblins are the ones who never come out of their stinking holes\u201d, which unfortunately the goblins never do, so he has to kill them all. And I have to hand it to him to stick to his principles: to kill every single goblin in the world.\\n\\n\r\nNow, one may notice that some episodes feature \u2018slice of life\u201d moments, such as Goblin Slayer repairing his equipment, interacting with other adventurers, participating in shopping, checking his surroundings on the farm, etc. These moments are pretty boring, but it does add to the setting and provides some characterization for our main character. Furthermore, there are plenty of scenes where episodes focus on different characters along with their actions, fanservice from the main female characters, and jokes and laughs. However, in Goblin Slayer fashion, our main character doesn\u2019t care about other adventurers beyond his own friends, he doesn\u2019t care about the fanservice from his female companions and friends, and he doesn\u2019t care to have a sense of humor. The only thing he cares about is knowing where the goblins are and killing them.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\\n\r\nOur main character, Goblin Slayer, does what his name implies. He slays goblins, and nothing else but goblins. His reasons for killing goblins and only goblins originated from a tragic event that occurred in his childhood, i.e., the death of his older sister, and the destruction of his village. These two awful events changed him and, on that day, he swore vengeance against every goblin in the world. It\u2019s this vengeance that allows him to keep on living, in fact, even in situation where he should have died, he gets back up, and continues to kill as many goblins as possible. He\u2019s literally to angry to die. I have to admire his dedication and devotion to killing these goblins, even when he\u2019s about to die.\\n\\n\r\nAnd because, Goblin Slayer is our main character, he gets a lot of screen time and thus get some character development, e.g., he changes and becomes friends with other adventurers, he works with other adventurers as oppose to working sole, and we learn about his reasons for vengeance. Our other companions, mainly High Elf Archer, Priestess, Dwarf Shaman, and Lizard Priest, don\u2019t really have much background information and their personalities are somewhat the same, i.e., they are all kind, caring, and concerned towards Goblin Slayer; they are much more cheerful and happier than Goblin Slayer; and their appearance and job description are implied in their name.\\n\\n\r\nSome tidbits that I like about Goblin Slayer include: 1) he speak little to no words, mainly sticking to phrases like, \u201cI see\u201d, \u201cthat\u2019s right\u201d, \u201cyes, that\u2019s right\u201d, and is that right?\u201d; 2) he\u2019s not swayed by woman and their advances even when he\u2019s seen them nude, and finally 3) his eye become bright red indicating he is angry and filled with rage, this happens quite frequently.\\n\\n\r\nART/ANIMATION/SOUND:\\n\\n\r\nGoblin Slayer\u2019s art and animations are hit-and-miss. On one hand, they feature outstanding battle scenes with fasting-moving animations, such as sword-swings, arrows flying though the air, people rolling and dodging attacks, and, of course, brutal executions and various attacks. They also feature a great setting, e.g., dark and narrow caves, wide and spacious fields, and dimly-lit caverns, thus creating an effective atmosphere and ambiance. However, there is the obvious and overused CGI Slayer that somewhat clashes with the cartoonish-look of other characters, especially the female adventurers. I guess the creators deliberately did this to make Goblin Slayer standout, but more importantly to make him appear like a badass. Which, in that case, I could forgive because every time he starts fighting and kicking ass, he does look badass. Another noticeable feature is the number of close-up shots of the female character\u2019s pink and glossy lips, I guess the creators did this to show that the females have wits and charm, or just to make them appear sexier in front of Goblin Slayer.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound design is also pretty good. The background music does an excellent job of providing the right mood for the right moments. such as heavy badass music before and during fight scenes. The opening song is dark and eerie which is perfect for a dark and brutal setting. The voice actors and actress do a great job at making the characters feel alive, especially our main character who, thankful, doesn\u2019t sound too \u201cdark and edgy\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\\n\r\nHaving read Goblin Slayer, the manga version, I already knew what I was getting into, in fact, I was looking forward to watching this series. And did it disappoint? Not really. Goblin Slayer stuck to its source material. It doesn\u2019t shy away from implying rape and torture scenes, and the numerous \u2018glory kills\u2019 only reinforce the dark and brutal setting. I\u2019ll admit the story and characters are somewhat simple and straightforward, especially the characters, however its entertainment value lies within this simplicity.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I mean is this: Goblin Slayer, our protagonist, kicks ass and kills goblins, anytime and anywhere. That\u2019s it. And for me that\u2019s what makes it so enjoyable, watching this \u2018madman\u2019 or \u2018crazy bastard\u2019 kill a bunch of goblins in the most brutal manner possible has never been so entertaining. As, for the story, it\u2019s basically a depiction of Goblin Slayer\u2019s \u201cadventures\u201d. A vehicle that showcases what Goblin Slayer does to the goblins. And we all know what he does to them. And this alone makes this series worth watching.",

            "content": "TL;DR: at bottom ***Minor Spoiler from episode 1 below***\r\nI am not familiar with the source material, my review is solely based on the first 4 episodes.\r\nCHARACTERS: 2/10\r\nThe worst part of the show is the main character. He is an empty tin-can, both literally and figuratively.\r\nHe is always wearing full body armor which covers his face and body at all times. This might look bad-ass in a character with \r\nless screen-time. But when the main character is wearing armor doing mundane things, like eating though though his metal visor, \r\nit really makes him look retarded.\r\nOne might overlook the superficial appearance of MC if he was givensomething resembling a personality.\\n\r\nHe is obsessed with killing goblins because TRAGIC BACKSTORY.\\n\r\nBoo-Fu*king Hoo\\n\\n\\n\r\nHis responses are monotone, like a robot.\\n\r\n99% of his responses are\\n\r\n \"Is that so?\"\\n\r\n \" Fine..\"\\n\r\n \"I See..\"\\n\r\n \" Where are the goblins?\"\\n\\n\r\nThese repetitive responses, combined with his appearance really get on your nerves over time. You don't care about him at all.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe Main girl character has turned 15 and she really wants to be an adventurer. That's her motivation & \"personality\".\\n\\n\r\nSupporting cast is your generic tropes in an adventure anime. Most of them are there to talk about Goblin Slayer, to make up for his cinder block personality.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 1/10\\n\r\nStory is non existent until now. Just kill goblins thats all.\\n\r\nThe biggest flaw here is TONAL INCONSISTENCY\\n\r\nCharacters are non-serious, joking and bickering, sometimes, even during dangerous quests, followed by scenes of carnage, immediately followed by same jokes.\\n\\n\r\nIts almost like the things happening aren't real and have no effect on them.\\n\r\nThey look like Edgy teens running around in a Adventure game.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nART, ANIMATION & SOUND 6/10.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNOW LETS TALK ABOUT THE INFAMOUS SCENE * SPOILER FROM EPISODE 1*\\n\\n\r\nThere is a random girl adventurer that gets raped by goblins. She is immediately cast aside by the end of episode. \\n\r\nWhy not make her the main girl? She has a lot more reason to fight goblins and the motivation behind her actions would be self-evident.\\n\r\n And this would have made a dark action packed emotional drama with cathartic violence.\\n\r\nBut the show neither had the intellect nor the courage to actually deal with such an issue.\\n\r\nThat is why I would say the rape scene was unnecessary, exploitative and only there to seem edgy.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR:\\n\r\nA Human shaped Tin-can, a stupid girl, an elf, a dwarf and a lizard-man walk into a bar.\\n\r\nAll of them talk about how great the Tin-Can is.\\n\\n\r\nTin-Can says \"Where are the goblins?\"\\n\\n",

            "content": "\"Slice of life really just tends to write itself.\"\r\n- Gen Urobuchi \r\nThese were the words I found myself saying when watching this newest iyeshikai (=healing anime) by White Fox. After the dark and edgy filled last season where a nameless series contained a traumatizing hand-twist scenes, I was blessed with a series that values the comfy and cozy side of every day life. These type of 2pure4this world narratives may to be very well-written or plot heavy series in generally, but they offer something most other series can only dream of: beauty.\r\nOur story centers around the daily life of a man who we simply referas the Goblin Slayer. His favorite past time includes slaying goblins, hence the name. Just like in many other healing centric series, Goblin Slayer himself is a very likable and strong person who essentially is offering the viewers a certain feeling of \"safety\" and \"comfort\" and overall a welcoming atmosphere that could be compared to the safe-space level of ASMR videos. This feeling is presented so well and in such a powerful manner that even other characters are feeling the healing and safety effect of Goblin Slayer by simply being close to him. This is the type of stuff that relieves my stress and gives me hope for better tomorrow, and also works as the main motivator for character development seen in the series. The character development for other character, I mean, as Goblin Slayer himself is already flawless.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest difference between Goblin Slayer and typical comfy stuff are the existence of \"villains\" in the series, who are -of course- essential part of the series, after all, how can man slay goblins if there are none? The \"green little shits\" side of this story is where the real good stuff is at. Essentially, these characters are what us humans would be if we didn't have someone as awesome by our side as Goblin Slayer. The acts of goblins are something us modern humans couldn't even comprehend. They do not follow such human-made concepts as moral compass or right or wrong. However, this is not to be mixed with one-dimensional characterization. Oh, no. What we, once again are seeing here, is what us humans would be if we didn't limit ourselves with self-invented moral codes. When the first goblin incident occurred, I didn't see any evil doing, but the natural act of uncensored person who is enjoying the good things life. These including the intimate acts inspired by our natural need to reproduce.\\n\\n\r\nThis might raise the question: what else exactly happens in the series? And that's the smartest decision that was made here: Absolutely nothing. That's right. The entire series is about slaying goblins and unwilling acts of mating. As a person who appreciates the simple things in life, the content where quantity is not prioritized but the quality of it -- anti-jack of all trades, master of none -- I truly appreciate what Goblin Slayer does with its overall story. It doesn't extend its art forms: it masters them. To get back to my original \"this is beauty\" claim, Andre Gide, a famous French writer and poet, has been rewarded for the quote \"Only those things are beautiful that were inspired by madness and written for a reason.\" And I find myself thinking these words whenever a goblin gets its head smashed in or the distant screams of unwilling sexual intercourse are echoing in the walls of any dungeon. This is what the rough, natural reality of life is all about, and life is ugly yet beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in the series is completely flawless because the scenes where goblins are slayered are great and the rapey scenes are also neat and nothing else happens. Therefore, no flaws. In all honesty, the art is the best part of the series and the single biggest upscaling from the manga. The highest maturity level, the cold and brutal atmosphere, the feel of a dark fantasy series and overall the badass characterization all have been changed to match what this series truly is about. For one, the color pallet is just ridiculously happy bright rainbows and unicorns -tier stuff that really brings alive the aesthetics and the all-positive look on things, serving the series and making it soothing to watch. \\n\\n\r\nSounds-wise, only smart decisions have been made. Whenever the characters mention Goblin Slayer, I find myself repeating out loud after them \"Gobulin Shleiyaa\". The foot-step sounds alone are already creating an awe-inspiring feel as this is the most badass walking sequence since the reappearance of The Mountain. I unplugged my bass, but the water surface on my glass was still making waves like in Jurassic Park. This is the type of stuff I like. The OST is also uplifting when it has to be and beyond calming and has a real home-feel to it especially in the tavern scenes and the sexual intercourse scenes.  Every part serves to warm its viewer's heart.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the content may occasionally be \"dark\" the series itself is radiating positivity and spirit, showing us how amazing humans can be even in situations that are less amazing and not preferred. By humans, I mean the ideal humans -- such as Goblin Slayer. Seeing how the weaklings, baka-boats and other people in the series who do not know how the world really works -- all are getting what is coming to them, is nothing less than a form of honesty. Only the strong, smart and most fit survive, and while many will not like it, this is what the ideal world looks like. There is no way to rig this game, and that's precisely why this series has a powerful healing effect. Equality in its purest sense. After just 4 episodes, I already feel like my very soul has been cleansed from everything that is evil, from all the injustice and acts in our very own world that make no sense and should not be. These things never occur in Goblin Slayer because it is a genuine work written based to how the world works and not how society wants it to work. 10/10",

            "content": "Goblin Slayer is an anime about a dude named Goblin Slayer who slays goblins. \r\nNow here's the part of my review where I wish I could say \"but there's just so much more to Goblin Slayer than that!\" Unfortunately, I just can't. In fact, with the exception of a few dark scenes, this show possesses all of the qualities of a typical fantasy world anime. Now is this a bad thing? Of course not. It's just that Goblin Slayer was hyped as a new and innovative approach to the genre. Yet from what I've seen so far, this simply isn't the case. In this preview,I'll list the two most prominent aspects of this anime that make it absolutely plain and generic.\\n\\n\r\n1. A lackluster plot that doesn't go anywhere.\\n\\n\r\nAt this point of a show, one would expect the story to have actually, you know, PROGRESSED in some way. Not Goblin Slayer. Other fantasy anime that many would probably classify as \"standard\" like DanMachi had already established some plot elements like character motivation and world building by this point. Yet in Goblin Slayer, what do we know? Well, there's a run of the mill guild that serves as the location for literally every relevant conversation and character interaction in the show...Okay, what else? Umm, apparently the demon lord is threatening the world, but no one seems to care too much...Wow, that's TOTALLY original...Oh, and goblins raid villages, pillaging and raping everything they see. Hmm, how...innovative? Seriously though, we know absolutely NOTHING about the world of Goblin Slayer. There's just a lot of much needed depth that's simply missing from this anime. All I've gotten out of this show is that goblins are bad and must be slayed. And to be honest, that's quite disappointing. \\n\\n\r\n2. One note characters with little to no depth.\\n\\n\r\nThe most prominent example is the protagonist Goblin Slayer. Anyone who has simply heard about this anime or read the source material knows that this man loves to kill goblins. Aaaaand that's it. So far, his personality hasn't developed at all. In fact, it's a stretch to say that he even has a personality. I'll give you a basic example of why his fixation on goblins can be detrimental to the already weak narrative. \\n\\n\r\nElf, Dwarf, and Lizard: \"Hey bro, we heard that u r supah cool fighta & want you to help us kill da demon lard.\"\\n\\n\r\nGoblin Slayer: \"Did you say goblins?\"\\n\\n\r\nElf: \"wtf\"\\n\\n\r\nYeah, that's basically how the meeting between these characters went down. Well, at least Goblin Slayer's given a good reason for hating goblins. And he looks cool when he's not animated in hideous cgi, so that has to count for something, right?\\n\\n\r\nSo while I was composing this preview, I realized that I didn't know the name of any other character in the show. Then it dawned on me that none of them actually have NAMES. They're just given titles like \"Priestess\" and \"Cow Girl.\" I mean what the hell? If that doesn't completely detract from any connection to the characters that a viewer might have, than I don't know what does. Well, I guess I might as well talk about some of them. Priestess is a cute, innocent girl who follows Goblin Slayer because...she can. Cow Girl is Goblin Slayer's childhood friend who clearly loves him and dotes on him but gets completely shafted by Goblin Slayer's fixation on goblins. Dem feels doe. High Elf Archer is obviously best girl cause she's a hot tsundere elf girl who gets drunk easily. Oh yeah, there are also some dudes in this show, but nobody really cares about them, so...moving on!\\n\\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, I have no problems with the cast. I even hope that the anime gives them much needed development down the line. But for now, there's just nothing that noteworthy about any of them. They're just, well, average.\\n\\n\r\nOn a positive note, the anime has decent technical aspects, but nothing outstanding. The opening theme is a pretty good song. It's a captivating combination of both modern and classical music that perfectly coincides with the tone of the anime. The seiyuu do a fine job and perform their roles adequately enough. The visuals are pretty standard, and I have no problems with the animation besides the choppy and unrefined cgi. \\n\\n\r\nSo I've established that Goblin Slayer is basically average in every sense of the word. But there has to be something special about it, or else it wouldn't receive so much attention. So what does Goblin Slayer have that makes it stand out from the rest of the crowd? Extreme Edgyness! \\n\\n\r\nThough in all seriousness, it's not nearly as edgy as people make it out to be.\\n\\n\r\nI simply couldn't end this review without discussing what made Goblin Slayer so popular (or maybe \"infamous\" is a more suitable word). Yes, this anime has rape and gore, which is heavily demonstrated in the first episode. Thankfully, it's not used to the extreme in every episode, which would, for me, be quite detrimental to the anime. Instead, it's used as a means to show that fantasy worlds aren't all fun and games, and that they contain a lot of pain and misery too. Makes you think twice about wanting to live in a fantasy world full of monsters even if you get all of dem waifus, doesn't it? \\n\\n\r\nThat's right, I'm actually defending the dark scenes in this show because they do, in fact, add layers to this anime (albeit pretty thin layers). I betcha thought that I was a butthurt snowflake who would complain about the rape scene after seeing my score for this show. But it was I, Di- *ahem* Anyway, like I wrote in this review, Goblin Slayer's flaws lie elsewhere.\\n\\n\r\nYou know, if the anime continues down the path it's going, but starts to include some good plot progression and character development, then I think it could actually be at least a semi-decent and entertaining anime. But for now, it's just lacking too much to be anything but mediocre and generic, which is really unfortunate.",

            "content": "\u201cAnyone who likes/dislikes this show is a Nazi/Libtard.\u201d \u2013 The state of the anime community after episode 1.\r\nI think it is fair to say that no other anime has caused such controversy and overwhelming divide amongst anime fans after a single episode like Goblin Slayer has. The pilot almost effortlessly setting a spark across the community that would act as ignition to countless flame wars lasting for weeks on end. A scene lasting around fifteen seconds receiving more vitriol and condemnation than arguably every other anime airing this year. On the surface, the divide seems clear: on one side lies those vocal to their displeasureof even the sheer existence of this series, labelling it as edgy, repugnant and pornographic. Some going even so far as comparing the anime to Nazi propaganda decades ago. And on the opposing side lies the fandom, constantly upset by criticism their beloved show receives and reverting to insults and name-calling them with popular phrases such as the dreaded \u201cSJW\u201d for example. But these are simply gross generalisations of both the series and its viewers, centring upon a small group of outspoken individuals that unfortunately leads any attempt of discourse astray. Instead my aim here is to hopefully bring a more critical view on Goblin Slayer to the discussion; of the series\u2019 perceived intent, as well as numerous faults and issues prevalent throughout its first season.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cThe gods of light, order and fate, and the gods of darkness, chaos and coincidence decided to throw dice in order to determine which side would rule the world. The gods threw the dice over and over and over again, until they began to feel faint.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nGoblin Slayer is a dark fantasy anime adapted from both the manga and light novels of the same name, highly inspired by tabletop role-playing games. Initially the story follows a young woman known as \u201cPriestess\u201d that has recently become an adventurer and joins an upstart party on her first quest. Their naivety and inexperience ultimately lead to their grim demise, ravaged by goblins who commit heinous acts such as rape and dismemberment depicted in much more graphic fashion compared to other fantasy anime of recent years. Before the Priestess can be dispatched however, the actual protagonist appears from the shadows, intent of massacring every goblin in sight. From this point, the series is predominantly focused on this mysterious adventurer commonly referred to as \u201cGoblin Slayer\u201d and his efforts to exterminate the entire goblin species.\\n\\n\r\nThe beginning to this story gives what I believe to be a clear sense of what Goblin Slayer strives to be. Simplistic, cheerful dialogue to elucidate fundamentals of the adventurer system, a light-hearted tone able to create a strong optimistic mood, even the visuals and audio utilizing light colours for character designs coupled with an upbeat tune all try and convey a presentation akin to the typical fantasy anime of recent memory. The group of upstart adventurers each can be seen representing archetypes one would expect to be present in such a series: tsundere, loli character, main character for a harem, etc. Numerous times before a goblin appears on screen, subtle signs are revealed about the party\u2019s lack of preparation and expectation to indicate this quest will not be as successful as they hope, and then what follows is a shocking realization of what the world of Goblin Slayer truly entails. Essentially these characters were tools for the series to subvert people\u2019s initial expectations of the story, with the tragic events that entail further emphasizing this point. The sickening portrayal and detail of these actions going to further lengths than most anime fans have probably ever experienced previously in the medium. Disgusting to watch even for the short time shown, and from the reception this anime received, it looks to have garnered the initial reaction staff had intended. From this perspective, while many can find these scenes crass and tactless in their depiction, I find it difficult to call this part of Goblin Slayer lazy writing.\\n\\n\r\nShortly followed by the introduction of the titular protagonist reveals a change that strongly contrast to events that just transpired earlier. Compared to the almost wilfully ignorant upstart adventurers that end up decimated to the lowest mob type in the world, Goblin Slayer\u2019s approach to killing goblins is much more tactical. Shown to analyse nearly every time he murders a single goblin, often determining the most effective method for slaughtering the mob step-by-step before executing his strategy in cold, calculated fashion. Through this he not only personifies the kind of badass main character one would expect for a darker fantasy story, but also provides a solid understanding of how a high-level adventurer would be expected to act in battle. Armed with various weapons and antidotes whilst always on the lookout for signs, Goblin Slayer has enough tools at his disposal to face any goblin he would come across. A clear juxtaposition to how many inexperienced adventurers would conduct themselves. Him slaughtering the horde also raises an intriguing question of Goblin Slayer\u2019s morality when intending to murder the child goblins. While the protagonist remains steadfast of his opinion on the species, the Priestess brings forth the possibility of a \u201cgood goblin\u201d. Despite going through with eliminating them, he does admit there could be one out there. From this, viewers have a grasp on how this tale could further develop this idea with having both character\u2019s ethics challenged as Goblin Slayer\u2019s quest continues. There is potential in this tale to be more than just the fun schlock of the season. Unfortunately, that potential slowly gets squandered every episode following, and personally even loses the series\u2019 initial appeal.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the more detrimental choices I find a story can make is following an attempt to create a purposeful, serious tone, and then reverting to what it tried to distance itself from initially. After Goblin Slayer\u2019s shocking start that firmly established the story as a dark fantasy that supposedly takes itself seriously, the anime takes an odd change in tone that is rather baffling to understand. Numerous quests later in the series showcase characters in a way you would never have expected in Goblin Slayer, with an array of playful, trifling scenes one would more commonly associate with a slice-of-life anime than this show. Somehow the series decided to skip on possibly showing some of the effects trauma experienced from death, sexual assault or even just being an adventure can have on a person, instead these scenes barely contribute to the characters on a notable level. The change in tone can lead to breaks in one\u2019s immersion of the story and the protagonist it follows, with transitions feeling awkward and out of place more often than not. A notorious example can be found in episode 2 where the episode cuts to a well-endowed redhead girl waking out of bed and stretching, followed by some of the most prominent jiggle physics to be found this season. I thought this was meant to be a serious tale. For a dark fantasy to work, usually it requires the atmosphere of a series to remain constant enough to a degree where the earnestness and consequences of actions can still be felt through the more cheerful scenes. Berserk, Attack on Titan and Fullmetal Alchemist 2003 are just some examples of dark fantasy anime that constantly have a sombre air about them, constantly felt when witnessing the actions of their characters. Goblin Slayer lacks this air that breezes alongside the narrative and whilst continuing to lack a strong sense of identity in a genre already spoiled by an abundance of generic fantasy, it is more inclined to leave a stale taste in the mouths of those hoping for Goblin Slayer to distance itself further from its contemporaries.\\n\\n\r\nThis lack of an identity also permeates the narrative and overarching worldbuilding to a degree that I have to address. When a series attempts to be a subversion or even a deconstruction of a genre, normally this would involve acknowledging tropes typically associated with a genre whilst subverting their intentions. Goblin Slayer, at least in its first season, does not do this. Alongside the series constantly switching the tone between dark and nonchalant, the anime seems to never want to take its world very seriously despite the premise. Goblin Slayer is a man who has an unrelenting obsession to kill goblins as they are a species that lingers on as a problem for innocent people. They are weak creature with childlike intelligence individually, but as a mob are a destructive force which can lead to the devastation of entire towns. An interesting yet believable problem in this world. So then, how is it believable to think that there is only one person that acts in response to this problem? Because the anime has mainly taken place around a small town there is a possibility for other adventurers similar to Goblin Slayer to be primarily hunting goblins in their own areas of the world. But thinking on a large scale, if goblin mobs can and already have been a significant cause of wiping out various towns, would someone not think that their effect to agriculture and the overall economy poses a severe threat on a national scale, to where even adventurers seeking glory and fame would end up losing money? I would have at least expected some form of intervention \u2013 here is an idea: have some adventurers hired as a form of security for farmers against a potential goblin attack. Or at least have the guild girl not allow novices to take these jobs when it is made apparent how many novices and kidnapped and killed off by goblin mobs! If so many are dying because of this fact, maybe it would be best to intervene, even if with just a simple warning about how dangerous they are, and how prevalent this is. If only Goblin Slayer had more consistency in its world that more people could admire, instead of trying to subvert common fantasy anime tropes and then as if almost contradictory to itself maintaining a level of unbelievability behind how these aspects work in its story.\\n\\n\r\nIt is upsetting how a show essentially fails at fleshing out the more complex issues the world of Goblin Slayer encompasses, especially when most of the defence for this anime in regards to certain actions and events is derived from insular logic. A common complaint for the series initially was based around why goblins rape, and while it certainly is specified that rape is their only option for reproduction, that does not cover details about their creation. Goblins here are force-of-nature villains that embody evil and chaos, thus not requiring distinct personalities and from this the rape shown can be considered a further way of emphasizing that point thus bringing them to where they can be considered irredeemable, but this only works on a narrative level. All works of fiction are made with intentions from their creator/s and by peeling down the layers of in-universe context is one able to search for the purpose and intentions behind specific scenes, actions, etc. Often termed the Thermian Argument, it claims that pointing to a show\u2019s logic in response to criticism of the subject matter is inherently fallacious. It supports a difference between what is being depicted and why such is being depicted at all; a metanarrative point of view. I stated what I believed to be the main intention behind such shocking acts in the first episode as a way for the show to subvert the audience for what kind of anime they were in store for, but after witnessing the series make that idea almost completely irrelevant through poor direction, tonal dissonance and having such actions repeated onscreen later with similarly crude framing for reasons even I am unsure of, it is hard to defend the series for all these creative choices happening numerous times throughout the anime\u2019s duration from a metanarrative point of view.\\n\\n\r\nCharacterization is one of Goblin Slayer\u2019s focal points if even only applying to one individual so far. Goblin Slayer is the embodiment of a man who refuses to die before his purpose in life is seen through to the end. Driven by revenge after goblins took away the person most precious to him, he epitomizes the idea of how a badass protagonist should act. His character design is also impressive in certain scenes with a red eye theme glowing in the darkness that oozes a killer instinct rarely found in anime nowadays. Reminder that the in-universe creation of the series was founded on gods rolling dice and playing the game of chance, with all various races and species being birthed purely for their amusement. But with the way Goblin Slayer acts, he can be considered the one character in this world to defy the will and wishes of those who created him. And while there are numerous examples of him conveniently surviving so far due to plot armour, the intent remains \u2013 underneath his monotonous voice and implied social awkwardness lies the potential for a metaphorical figure of inspiration. Unfortunately, that is where most of the praise for characters ends at this point in the anime. Every character besides Goblin Slayer receives little attention in the anime, with minimal development bar the Priestess who acts as a rookie slowly growing and learning how to survive as an adventurer in this harsh world, however even this has made little progress this first season. Other characters sprinkled across the story range from other rookies slowly improving and gaining experience to dependable fighters often able to hold their own in battle, which is a striking difference compared to how most typically act away from any battlefield; childish and immature. Honestly, besides Priestess and Goblin Slayer the rest of the cast are easily expendable, but I guess that is to be expected when the supporting cast includes names such as \u201cCow Girl\u201d and \u201cLizardman\u201d. Hopefully if there is a sequel, they have a better opportunity to leave a lasting impression on the anime.\\n\\n\r\nMuch like these forgettable characters the production quality for Goblin Slayer also failed to leave a strong impact. The art is not very detailed, with most character designs and backgrounds often appearing plain and generic for most of the season. A mixture of 2D and 3D animation is used to jarring effect, with most action scenes and the occasional panning shot relying on CGI that look more like an eyesore that anything visually pleasing. In fact, most of the better-looking shots involve scenes lacking any sort of movement. Disappointing as the artwork is commonly seen as a key strength to the manga\u2019s popularity. For a series where the most basic appeal comes from a guy mowing down goblins, the action was underwhelming and that kills a show like this. Wish I could say otherwise for the soundtrack, but that also failed to leave a strong impression on me. Voice acting was solid but effectively crippled with a lacklustre script treating half the characters as dense. The opening theme was melancholic but failed to ever have me personally want to listen to it more than once. The ending theme while I certainly enjoyed it more was accompanied by CGI Goblin Slayer with clunky animation. At least the ending track was fun.\\n\\n\r\nGoblin Slayer is at its core, an anime about one man slaying goblins. Though it can tempt viewers with ideas of something greater at work, it still boils down to a mere schlocky action show with lacklustre presentation that by the end of its first season has its biggest strengths stemming from potential and a hope that a sequel can further flesh out characters and worldbuilding which at this point cannot hold up to scrutiny. But it does have its appealing qualities no matter how superficial they might be. If you are willing to take a chance on a simple action anime trying to break the trend of generic fantasy released this year, this might be worth your investment. My main hope is that now with the most controversial anime of the year finished, the community at large can learn from this experience. As the old saying goes: \u201cThat which does not kill us makes us stronger.\u201d\\n",

            "content": "I'm at a loss for words.\r\nNot because of the show's quite questionable and more than broken quality, which I and many others, have been pointing our fingers at since the first episode made its appearance, but rather something... much more bizarre. I find it astonishing how much controversy and heated exchanges a single scene has sparked up among the viewers, even though its importance, in the grand scheme of things, is as insignificant as one can be.\r\nAnd I will never understand how and why a mind-numbing phenomenon of this calibre came into existence, but I digress.\r\nGoblin Slayer is not a fundamentally weak story, and Iwant to get it out of the way from the get-go. Sure, it is a notably straightforward one, but a work's extreme simplicity should never, under no circumstances, be considered a bad thing. Frankly, if executed correctly, the anime would be a silly yet moderately delightful experience, I would be willing to even revisit at a certain point in the future. That did not happen though as too many components of this now deformed cake came out as undercooked.\\n\\n\r\nThe logic in Goblin Slayer is one of my favourites. Goblins are established as a level one mob, a being with intelligence and strength of a child, which are not worth wasting your time on. Adventurers are reluctant to pick up quests revolving around the little bastards for that reason alone; they will not grant you glory and an excessive amount of gold. That is understandable yet odd at the same time. We learn that goblins, with time, can mutate and become a stronger version of themselves, champions, shamans etc. And no one seems to care about it! Does the government or the military exist? We never hear about the monstrous demons and different abnormalities making their moves in our world since the Demon Lord-esque being has been defeated, which would be the priority, so these fellas don't have their hands full. Goblins can, literally, ruin economy at its very core, destroying villages, crops, kidnapping women and killing farmers, yet, people overlook it and do not see it as a glaring and alarming problem. Maybe they are waiting for hordes of goblins knocking at their door to remind them of this? Or perhaps they are waiting for the guild to send inadequately qualified rookies to certain death and young girls to help goblins reproduce, like the insensitive degenerates they are?  Who knows; I for one do not. \\n\\n\r\nI do not understand the idea behind implementing a \"moral dilemma\" as well. In episode one, after the Goblin Slayer had slaughtered a group of his favourite pesky green creatures, he found a hole with a few baby gobs hiding inside it. Naturally, he decided to help them meet their end, but for a reason still foreign to me, Priestess, with a face covered in tears, tried to prevent him from doing that by saying \"what if there are good goblins?\". Here is the problem with this sentence; no one should raise such a question. Goblins use women, murder and destroy on a daily basis, and everyone, even newbies know about it, considering the Priestess admitted that such things often take place in the world. They are inherently evil beings, who hate \"those with words\" and we are witnessing this very image of them, remarkably black and white monsters with one goal in mind, on every instant throughout the show, making the concept of a good goblin even less probable, to the point of impossibility. Though we can merely bat an eye on this odd situation, the limitations Elf Archer put on the Goblin Slayer are not that easy to ignore. The implementation of the \"No water, fire or gas.\" rule was a logical decision during the sewer mission as using any of these methods could potentially cause collateral damage, but other than that, I fail to understand its presence in the story. Goblins are horrendous, so why should they not be treated like filth, which someone has to eliminate from the face of the earth no matter the methods used? Why should they not be killed in nonhumanitarian ways? I cannot wrap my head around this one. Of course, I might be just a picky bastard for mentioning those, but this attempt at bringing a little bit of \"depth\" to the story bothers me a lot. It looks as if the series desires you to take it more seriously, but, in my eyes, both the morals and Sword Maiden's horrific PTSD cripple the experience rather than enhancing it.\\n\\n\r\nThese pretty irritating problems with the narrative could have been easily avoided or at the very least reduced in intensity if the characters had not been cardboard cutouts. It upsets me to no end that the supporting cast is so fixated on the titular character that their goals and ideas seem not to exist at all. In reality, we know nothing about these folks; absolutely nothing. Their names are that of the classes or roles they represent since the author is not good at coming up with names, we have no idea why they accompany him, and their backstories are nonexistent just like their personalities. Honestly, I could describe the characters one by one using three words at max. Even the Goblin Slayer, the \"person\" who has got the most amount of screentime and development in the entire story, fits the bill perfectly. Despite not having any social skills, redeeming qualities as a person and, overall, being a monotonous walking trash bin with his only quirk being his tragic past, girls flock to him as if he were the most handsome chad they have ever seen, creating a harem full of carboards head over heels with him. You either become a part of the collection or are a nameless component of the background, whose entire existence boils down to making fun of the titular character merely to do a 360 and convert into one of his newly found buddies. \\n\\n\r\nFor a show with such brutal content, it sure as hell does not restrain itself from exhibiting blatant, in your face fanservice. I'm not against seeing a tit or two, but I believe that displaying an extremely sexualised \"morning routine\" right at the start of episode 2, which is the polar opposite of the travesty we witnessed a week earlier, is not the most brilliant idea ever. Same goes for the character of Sword Maiden, whose sole reason to exist is being a fanservice dispenser, shoving her pair everywhere it is possible with an extremely horny attitude and the camera pointing at her immense cleavage whenever it can. Even though we ought to look at her heroic records of a gold ranked adventurer as an impressive feat, her inadequately handled, if communicated at all, PTSD, instead of doing the character favour, made the Sword-Maiden a damsel in distress relying on the Goblin Slayer to save her from the monsters who used her when she was younger. The fact that a mental disorder was utilised for mere wish fulfilment is sickening.\\n\\n\r\nThe show does not know what it seeks to be. Its tone is, to put it plainly, all over the place. Like blood and corpses, the slice of life moments filled with characterless struggles at comedy and the previously mentioned plethora of tasteless fanservice scenes are regular guests on the screen. In one instance, the cast is having fun, bantering with each other, enjoying food or other activities, and in the next scene, there are blood and gore everywhere. Heck, even moments which are supposed to invoke emotions are immediately squashed by booby shots. Complete tonal dissonance achieved. Viewers disengaged. \\n\\n\r\nI wish I could compliment Goblin Slayer a little bit for its overall visuals, but, in all fairness, there is nothing worth praising here. While the art style has that generic oomph to it and does not ooze with any striking manner or personality, for the most part, it looks okay-ish. I cannot deny that; the designs seem decent, and some of the backgrounds are not half-bad. Nothing worth being called good, yet not offensive either. However, the constant, jarring CGI, presumably used to put off the viewers and make them feel as uncomfortable as it is humanly possible, completely ruined one aspect the show had going for it, its appearance. I could count on the fingers of two hands the number of scenes where the Goblin Slayer is not 3D while walking or making other movements. I understand the creators' intent, they did not want to draw his somewhat intricate armour piece thus save some time, but the final result of this overuse of CGI is nothing short of saddening and immersion breaking for its quality is utter rubbish.\\n\\n\r\nIt gets even worse when we have the opportunity to observe a fight scene because, oh boy, the animation in these is something out of this world. I have seen my fair share of battles so dull, linear, poorly thought out and animated that make your insides scream in agony and here, most of the encounters suit this category of a sort quite well. The tension is never present since, in the back of our minds, there is always that certainty that the red, glowing eye of the edge will prevail by the end of the day; his script reading skills come in handy all the time. Furthermore, every single fight tastes the same, with the door to creativity forcibly sealed because of the abnormally dumb and absurd morals enforced on the cast, which prefers to stick to a handful of spells, occasionally whipping out a new one for the oh-so-fantastic surprise to forgetting about the restrictions and winning without much stress and hardships with distinctive tactics. \\n\\n\r\nSigh, I wanted to enjoy the show for what it is, but Goblin Slayer is like a patchwork of the worst kind. It tried to be a jack of all trades, yet ultimately became a master of none; implemented a myriad of different elements only to watch them painfully fall flat on their faces. Attempting \"depth\" which added nothing of substance, having more than an apparent identity crisis, while maintaining the unintentional hilariousness at its highest level; this utterly devoid of motion and emotion series fueled by controversy and tears of soy will soon perish into the unimportance as, in spite of its position of the hottest show of Autumn 2018 and le epic meme generator, it will hopefully soon be forgotten. \\n\\n\r\nAnd the thought makes me happy.",

            "content": "Goblin Slayer is a show that abducted my wife and sold off my children into slavery. It is the reason I stay awake at night with visions of tiny green blurs bouncing on the edges of my bed. Undoubtedly, Goblin Slayer is singlehandedly the worst thing that has ever happened to me. I used to be an avid cave enthusiast with a PHD in cave science, but now I can't step one foot into a cave without my feet turning cold (and not due to the naturally decreasing temperature, either). I see them everywhere; in my dreams, in visions. Faint glimpses while walking down thestreet.  Menacing silhouettes in the distance. Moreover and especially whenever I'm eating peas. \\n\\n\r\nI finished my services in Nam back in early '75 and from then onwards assumed I wouldn't be put through anything similar again. Being violently thrust into the jungles of Saigon suddenly seemed all too inconsequential upon bearing witness to the first 10 minutes of Goblin Slayer. I have been scarred for life. Following these events, I have purchased a suit of chainmail armor and a few water scrolls from Ebay to protect myself from the inevitable and despite my therapist's best wishes. The end is neigh, my friends.\\n\\n\r\nJoking, this anime is bad lol. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to realize the sole reason it's currently in-season for one reason and for one reason only. Shock factor, but more specifically the rApE. Goblin Slayer is a substanceless heap of hot garbage, albeit hot garbage packed meticulously well. It serves as a constant reminder that the people who forfeit artistic integrity, and maybe even their pride - oftentimes have it the very best. Liking shock factor fueled shows isn't a small niche, granted, but not to this extent where everyone cares for them, and the people who don't typically know to avoid them. Yet for some reason once sexual assault gets thrown into the equation, everyone and their grandmothers rush to the scene. And only then too is it that people get upset and start storming the shed looking for pitchforks. \\n\\n\r\nDepiction of rape in art can either be tasteless or serve a purpose. In our case and in the humble beginnings of Goblin Slayer its initial intentions are presumably to villainize the goblins. Rape is probably the single easiest way to make the audience dislike the perpetrator. And low and behold, it works... for a while. Not before long, it devolves into nonsensical softcore porn, but more importantly manages to desensitize a large portion of the viewerbase to the act itself by repeatedly shoving it down our throats. Which has me convinced the word \"villainization\" is thrown around as nothing more than a convenient scapegoat here. If it truly were about muh villainizing, it did a damn shitty job by instead making me profusely grin at a child's sister unwillingly partaking in a goblin bukkake in front of his very eyes. \\n\\n\r\nIt's an actual fear of mine that some 12 year old somewhere on this very planet popped his first boner over a few goblin cummies. And what a massive one it must have certainly been. While it's clearly overused mainly just to maintain cheap interest for the story, the point to take away is that no one should have their goblin slaying experience sullied by implementation of needless hentai elements. If animated goblins really are your kink, HentaiHaven probably has you cov -- Oh, wait. :(\\n\\n\r\nBefore getting into the nitty gritty, litty titty, or the plot if you'd rather, it might be important to address the whirlpool of opinions surrounding the anime as a whole beforehand. Some conflicting, others in fullhearted agreeance, it doesn't really matter. The root of the problem is the sheer amount of opinions, instead. Please refrain from adding this anime to your stagnant PTW with 200+ and counting titles that you'll never get around to finishing in this lifetime or any other after seeing one scene and a Gigguk video on it. The most enjoyment someone can suck out of this withered goblin's crusty nutsack is watching a grown man get a stroke over episode one. Head on over to EtikaWorldNetwork for more information. \\n\\n\r\nYet youtubers, discussions, and the community as a whole have deemed it fit to blow a staggeringly boring show out of interstellar proportions. All because of a little edge. Consider realistically, what else does Goblin Slayer bring to the table? Cookie cutter characters, a nameless and faceless protagonist who is the literal living embodiment of stoicism itself and a Tolkein-esque animified high fantasy setting with that rudimentary boring ass guild system that's making me want to rip out my nose hairs by the second.  Konosuba you aight tho.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is, as the title suggests, a well over four hour journey of pure unadulterated goblin slaying and all the misadventures accompanied along with it (18+). Resembling a few anime due to the aforementioned setting, there are two I constantly see being referenced as similar, with Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash definitely being the most prominent one. These two shows clearly split at birth, and one is a bit less retarded than the other but it's still clear to see why the mother abandoned both. I have an entire review dedicated to Grimgar written two years ago, and seeing as I'm writing this right now you'd figure shoving special ed kids in lockers to be a specialty of mine. Berserk's the other one often mentioned, which almost seems like another gateway for Berserk fans to toot their own horn for liking the grimmest, darkest comic of them all. \"This series people like has rape? My series also has rape, but, like, betterer\". \\n\\n\r\nI'd like to say the show has a definitive highlight (i.e plot, characters), but it's about as consistent as Miura's writing. The quality of the fight scenes is incredibly varied, ranging anywhere from terribly unengaging to kinda fun and the SOL scenes inbetween are either boring as all hell or funny-ish. The humor in these scenes typically relies on showcasing how much of a flat out sociopath our protagonist is. It typically follows the structure of one of the side characters interacting with him in a normal way and him responding like a lizard person. Or like if Gendo Ikari had his own show and wasn't a neglectful father but instead the protagonist of an action adventure. Essentially, he's just Jotaro minus Star Platinum. While that means he'd probably still make a better Jojo than Jonathan, Jotaro has the power of unfunny memes and Jojokes on his side while this guy swims around in sewers killing goblins. Talk about luck of the draw. \\n\\n\r\nHis backstory is pretty unclear and at one point in the show he is even killed, only to be resurrected back to life by laying in a bed with a virgin. Disregarding the Kirito-tier plot armor for just a second, if that method of resurrection were applicable in real life I'm pretty sure the anime community would account for the single most renowned group of healers in the realm. Last but not least, his suit of CGI armor is incredibly ugly looking and has almost become synonymous with his character by now.  The epic character of.. the nameless titular character almost makes up for the fact that using more than a single adjective to describe the entire cast is overkill. The most characterization this lot gets is establishing a tropey elf vs dwarf rivalry and a personal favorite of mine, that is seeing the dragon-lizard-man's transformation into a certified cheese connoisseur\\n\\n\r\nAnyway there's really not much else to comment on. The main sauce of this whole Goblin Slayer saga lies in the fact that something so bland has gotten so tremendously popular and even well-received overseas. I call it a saga because judging by its level of success, it'd be dumb not to continue in this season's footsteeps. But I suggest instead of how power scaling exists in shonen, every season they up the ante by doubling on the number of goblin gangbangs.",

            "content": "The fall 18 is a pretty interesting season for anime. It was the season that gave us the nicely written romcom anime Bunny Girl but at the same time, it gave us the ulmate train-wreck of 2018 that was Tokyo Ghoul re where that season completely shat itself for a living. It was also the season that gave us the very underrated Release The Spyce, the epic and fun continuation Golden Kamuy second cour and the lovely sweet Bloom Into You. However all out all the anime from the Fall 18 there was one show that totally shocked the anime community when it first airedand that anime was Goblin Slayer. When the show first aired it gained a lot of controversy as it contained a lot of rape scenes that shocked the anime community. The first episode was so shocking Crunchyroll themselves had to change the rating from PG13 to R17+. Despite that, the first episode of Goblin Slayer didn't bother me all that much as I already knew by an advance that the series would have a lot of shock values thanks to people's reactions and unfortunately that is where Goblin Slayer starts to fall apart quickly because this is not a good series at all. If you remove the rape scenes, you're just left with a lifeless husk of a fantasy anime that fails to impresses the viewer outside its dark content. \\n\\n\r\nSo What went wrong with Goblin Slayer?\\n\\n\r\nWhat caused this show to be so bad where it becomes one of the worst animes of 2018. You will soon find out.\\n\\n\r\nStory.\\n\r\nThe story follows an inexperienced priest named Onna who joins a party of inexperienced adventurers where they take part in the first quest in a cave. However, the party first adventure doesn't go as well as apart from Onna the party ended getting attacked, killed and raped by Goblins. When all hope was lost she is saved by a man known as Goblin Slayer, an adventurer whose only purpose is the eradication of goblins with extreme prejudice. From there Goblin Slayer and Onna adventures of killing Goblins begin.\\n\\n\r\nBecause I think everything about the story is horrendous, I will be spiting the story section into small parts starting with the first episode.\\n\\n\r\nThis is the worst first episode I seen for 2018 as a whole. Outside of the cringe-inducing over the rape scenes the episode is poorly directed mess that is filled plot contrivances. For starters, the Guild lady is such a pushover because instead of being this strict but helpful builder she is a brain dead idiot who lets a bunch of first timers go ahead with the dangerous adventure without a veteran member of the guild. This is incompetent writing at it completely goes against nature and appeal of the fantasy genre that has a rank/level system. How would you like it if there was no one stopping you from going into caves that contained high-level monsters that can one-shot newbies? That defiantly wouldn't be fair as the newbie would have a big disadvantage from the beginning. The whole point of having a rank system is to not only identify players ranks but to also the people who have an edge in terms of battle experience. On top of all that we don't see the new adventurers even get prepared at all as stuff like testing out gear, magic, training by fight low-level creatures and even stocking potions/revival herbs are non-existent at all. There's a difference of being realistic and being downright incompetent there is no way in hell that an inexperienced group would do a quest without even getting prepare for it.\\n\r\nThis is almost as stupid as fighting the giant in Skyrim at level 1 carrying weak battle gear with no potions.\\n\\n\r\nKeep this in mind this is just the first episode. The series somehow manages to get even worse as time goes one as show literally betrays itself as a dark fantasy as where it decides to become the laziest and unoriginal light-hearted fantasy harem anime I have ever seen in my life. Many fantasy story elements from Goblin Slayer were done so much in other fantasy anime and some of the episodes feel like boring filler content. The tone shifts were out of control at various points, the pacing is below average and the writing itself is straight out incompetent. My favourite example of this incompetent writing happens in episode 7. After Oona pees herself off out of pure fear Giant goblin grabs her. Instead of biting her head off the goblin decided to bite a small part of her arm causing her to scream very loudly. This contrivance causes Goblin Slayer to get a random berserk power where despite him bleeding a lot in the progress he makes to take various goblins in his way until they eventually run away.\\n\\n\r\nAll of this is due to Goblin Slayer having writing comparable to bad fanfictions done by 12-year-olds and I'm sure that one of that the same 12-year-old writer who wrote Akame Ga Kill also wrote this.\\n\\n\r\nBefore I talk about the worst thing about Goblin Slayer let's talk about this show pathetic excuse of worldbuilding. The worldbuilding is Goblin Slayer is absolutely abysmal because not only does the series goes a horrendous job at establishing its own world but the people into the universe have absolutely no regard of the people are living in it. Some of the examples include how the group of adventures don't seem to have a reaction to the wagon that is filled with traumatised women who have been raped by goblins. Another example of how people in this universe don't seem to care about the goblin race as they all say that Goblin is weak creatures even though they have been capable of killing and raping people including experience adventurers.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nAs for the world establishment in Goblin Slayer itself, it's pretty awful. The lack of establishing monster races other than Goblins, blacksmith, inns, the name of the country that the series is set and I could go and go. The worldbuilding in Goblin Slayer it makes the worldbuilding in Akame Ga Kill and Re:Zero (White Fox other fantasy show) look competent by comparison.\\n\\n\r\nNow if you thought the worldbuilding is dogshit, the series direction is somehow even worse.\\n\\n\r\nIn my Tokyo Ghoul re: review, I mentioned that it was the worst directed series I have ever seen. Goblin Slayer made me seriously question what it really was. For me to answer this question is yes. Tokyo Ghoul re: was direction ultimately way worse but the direction in this series is still a complete abomination to a point where it makes the series direction for Darling in the Franxx and The Asterisk War look like a masterpiece by comparison.\\n\\n\r\nYou may think that I'm just skipping the character selection together to talk about the shows visuals but trust me this shows direction is so utterly horrendous I literally had to start talking about the show technical aspects.\\n\\n\r\nSome of the examples of the show abysmal directing happen in the first episode where get a bunch of disjointed shots off our adventures fighting the goblins. It was not pleasing to see thanks to abysmal camerawork and framing and it only made the scenes look more pathetic than actual fear.\\n\\n\r\nAnother good example happens in episode 11 where the character model of Goblin Slayer keeps changing to bad CGI model to 2D model. What had me facepalming hard was when he talked about the hoard of Goblins planning to attack the outskirts of the town the character model of Goblin Slayer kept on changing even when he isn't moving at all as he was just standing still.\\n\\n\r\nThe best example of this show disgusting direction happens at the end of episode 7. Normally in anime when an episode ends, a show would have nice transitions to the end credits. While not all shows are perfect of transitioning to the end credits it still does a good job of telling the audience visually that the episode of set series has finished. So what does Golbin Slayer episode 7 do you may ask? \\n\r\nWell instead of closing the episode like every other anime the series decides to have looped a still image with an eye-opening and closing for two minutes. TWO MINUTES!!! This decision boggled my mind so much that I thought I would intensely drop dead on the floor. How did anyone in Japan greenlight this broken directed fuckfeast of an episode?\\n\\n\r\nThe most infuriating part about all this that the dub version still kept that looped still shot. Could the production in this show be any more incompetent? Did someone in the editing room simply forget to do a transition to end credits? I'm sorry but this was simply unacceptable. I honestly cannot believe that this shit was a thing. Also, we don't speak about the recap episode of Goblin Slayer as it was just a horrendously compilation of poorly edited clips of the series that we already have seen before.\\n\r\nHow pathetic!!!\\n\r\nOverall the story of Goblin Slayer is a complete abomination.\\n\r\n0/10\\n\\n\r\nChararters.\\n\r\nThe characters Golbin Slayer are awful and I was being dead serious when I said that. They all just a bunch of uninspired one-dimensional shitheads.\\n\\n\r\nGoblin Slayer is one of the worst written characters in 2018. Not only he's an unlikable and unrelatable to the eye but he only has a single character trait that he just wants to kill Goblins for the rest of his life. I understand the series tried to make him as this stoic badass character but didn't work thanks to terrible writing. In many ways, he's no different to the typical silent protagonist that you will see in Video Games.\\n\\n\r\nOnna is not much better, in fact. She is even worst then Goblin Slayer as she is a just a plan useless girl from start to finish. There's nothing else to say about this useless husk of a chararter who just incompetent with her role and pissing herself whenever she gets scared.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters in Goblin Slayer are nothing but the bottom of the barrel collection of fantasy characters tropes.\\n\\n\r\nOld drunken fart (Dwarf Shaman)\\n\r\nGeneric fantasy girl (High Elf Archer) \\n\r\nTits girl (Cow Girl) \\n\r\nBootleg Guts (Heavy Swordsman)\\n\\n\r\nI could go on and one talking about how lifeless these characters are I won't because since this show doesn't care about making these characters interesting so why should I bother. They are just a bunch of empty husks that exists in this lifeless husk of a fantasy show that prioritizes pandering to a certain audience being the edgy 12-year-olds over actually telling a story that has a purpose.\\n\r\nScrew this!!!\\n\r\n1/10\\n\\n\r\nVisuals.\\n\r\nGoblin Slayer visually look liked they been lobotomized. There is not a single frame of decent art here let alone okay animation. Now I think about it this show seriously looks like it was fished out of a toilet. Some of the visuals in Goblin Slayer looked bad in 2002. The characters designs in Goblin Slayer uninspired as they all looked they throw away concept art for set fantasy anime. The same thing can apply for the background scenery.\\n\r\nThe fight choreography ranged subpar to awful as many of the battles outside the rape scenes don't seem to have any impact or weight to it as the animation is stiff and terribly animated. Let's not forget the shows horrendous use of CGI for the Goblins and Goblin Slayer armor. \\n\r\n2/10\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack has about much effort about put to it as the characters and visuals. The tracks are all uninspired fantasy that you all heard before. Many of the tracks sound like bad ripoffs from Overlord, Akame ga Kill and Berserk. Not they are generic but they sounded generically bad. The same thing can apply for the opening and ending themes.\\n\\n\r\nNow for sub vs dub.\\n\\n\r\nThe sub was okay for what it was as all the Seiyuus did an alright job with the roles that they were giving. So I have no complaints whatsoever with the sub.\\n\\n\r\nThe dub for Goblin Slayer is absolutely awful in every way possible. I seriously don't know what the hell was Funimation was thinking when they decided to dub the because it sounds like ass. The worst dub is Goblin Slayer himself as the actor who voiced him sounded like he was holding a tin can walkie-talkie.\\n\r\nHorrendous dub stick with the sub.\\n\r\n2/10\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts.\\n\r\nGoblin Slayer is a disgrace of a fantasy anime. It tried to this epic fantasy anime that contained a lot of blood and rape but it ultimately falls completely flat its face thanks to horsehit series directing, empty characters, horrendous worldbuilding that puts Akame ga Kill to shame and shit shock value writing. Studio White Fox may be a shit studio when it comes it fantasy anime but after watching Goblin Slayer it made me realise that they are not capable of making/adaptation fantasy anime as the studio would pander to the lowest common denominator rather than make a story that is worth telling.\\n\r\nYou're better off watching Berserk and Slayers rather than watching this bottom of the barrel fantasy anime that toys around the viewer mindset with its stupid fanservice and awful shock value. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Score 1/10\\n\r\nNow if you excuse me, I will be slaying Goblins in Dragons Dogma Dark Arisen.",

            "content": "This is a spoiler free review.\r\nGoblin Slayer is the one of the better series this season and probably the most popular anime this season. The show has an interesting concept, dark themes and it has decent comedy elements. It also has a interesting main character that hates goblins. Unfortunately, the show has a very controversial first episode that made a lot of viewers hate the show because of one scene.\r\n1. The controversy\r\nFor those who haven\u2019t followed the Goblin Slayer controversy. Right after the first episode this show has received tons of backlashes due to its rape scene. There have been a huge disturbance and conflictingdebates among the anime community. Many people were disgusted towards Goblin Slayer due to what it showed in the first episode. Some people got so triggered that they deemed the anime as trash and said that this anime promotes rape. Yes this anime has rape in it, so what?\\n\\n\r\nThe rape scene in Goblin Slayer is just an element in a dark-fantasy anime. The rape scene may not be necessary, but it does have purpose of describing a realistic fantasy world where dangers and stakes are real. A lot of other anime have rape scenes like SAO and Berserk, but why can't Goblin Slayer have a rape scene? The controversy of Goblin Slayer is just bullshit.\\n\\n\r\n2. Story 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe series is set in a generic fantasy world. The show is a deconstruction of the typical fantasy tropes by taking a new spin on the known character and world archetypesl. The story (and the OP) does allude to the fact that the world and the characters may be just a part of a game played by gods. Relationships between each of the characters are given enough time to develop and feel natural. This series has also some pretty good comedy elements.\\n\\n\r\n3. Art and animation 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is good and the fight scenes are also animated really good, but the series has a lot of stil frames and Goblin Slayer is a lot of the time in CG. The art and animation is overall good enough.\\n\\n\r\n4. Sound 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI liked the OP and ED a lot and the voice acting was decent, but I didn't like the voice acter of Goblin Slayer.\\n\\n\r\n5. Characters 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe first few episodes had not a lot of character development and we didn't know a lot about Goblin Slayer and the Priestess. However, by episode nine we got more background on Goblin Slayer. In general, both he and the Priestess are excellent characters. The other party members are also great, especially the elf, I loved her interactions with the Dwarf and Goblin Slayer a lot. Regardless of the pace of development, the characters are driving this anime more than anything else. They are all an interesting and entertaining bunch. It is hard not to like them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe show is great and I can wholeheartedly recommend it to all but the youngest anime fans. Even if You decide it\u2019s not for You, do so after watching three or four episodes instead of just the first one.\\n",

            "content": "Goblin Slayer makes me upset.\r\nNot because of its content, mind you.  But because THIS is what the community decided to make a whole brouhaha for, rassling endlessly about how \u201cDAE RAPE IS BAD???\u201d\r\nNow, I apologize, we\u2019ll talk about the show itself in a hot minute or two.  But the community discussion of Goblin Slayer really is integral to the series itself.  Like an album cycle from Kanye West, public reaction is all part of the seasonal anime paradigm, after all.  Even if this anime is lost to the weight of time (read: four months), it should be noted that this animecaused quite the stir for its first few weeks of airtime, until everyone finally realized that SSSS.Gridman and Zombieland Saga were the actually worthwhile shows. \\n\\n\r\nIt was hilarious.\\n\\n\r\nApparently, no one\u2019s seen Berserk.  Devilman: Crybaby wasn\u2019t a thing.  But this little ditty had an ape beginning with the letter \u2018r\u2019, so the community became a monkey house about it.  Many parts praising the anime, with a loudmouthed bunch absolutely horrified over it, causing the latter half to be even more vocal.  And that\u2019s why, at the time of this writing, Goblin Slayer is the most popular anime of Fall 2018, ahead of the new Sword Art Online, and the much more beloved adventures of Slimeboi and Bunny Girl.  Nevermind the fact that, two seasons ago, Mahou Shoujo Site literally did everything in its own first episode that Goblin Slayer did, plus change, and was outright buried by the community for it, the general seasonal community doesn\u2019t like to dwell on things too much.  Not that I\u2019m implying anything~\\n\\n\r\nAll this, for what?  Is Goblin Slayer REALLY that daring of a show?  Is it showing a brutal, grimdark reality?  Is it making a scathing social commentary?!  Is there an intellectual masterpiece lying underneath all of this terror?!?!\\n\\n\r\nHa ha ha!\\n\\n\r\nNo.  Like the Elf\u2019s chest, the answer is a flat, uninspiring no.\\n\\n\r\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I love Goblin Slayer a lot.  I think this show is a blast to watch.  But I don\u2019t consider this anything more than what I mentioned earlier.  \u201cCheap entertainment.\u201d  It\u2019s not gonna mentally challenge you, unless you\u2019re a literal retard.  In fact, as far as graphic violence goes, I\u2019d say there isn\u2019t really enough to recommend the anime based on that single element.  It\u2019s there and it\u2019s nice, but it\u2019s something that\u2019s lurking around the corner, rather than a relentless bombardment.\\n\\n\r\nBut, it\u2019s true.  Goblin Slayer--the character--has no personality.  The goblins themselves act as a mindless force who do bad things so the audience will root for their defeat.  The supporting cast is gimmicky; the setting, mild; the story, basic; and an artstyle uninspired. \\n\\n\r\nAnd to what end?  Well, the thing about Goblin Slayer is that it never really tries to offer a fully immersive adventure series.  The show doesn\u2019t ask you to think.  It doesn\u2019t ask to be questioned.  As dumb as it is, Goblin Slayer is exactly what the label says.  It\u2019s about Goblin Slayer.  His name is Goblin Slayer.  His occupation is being a Goblin Slayer.  \\n\\n\r\nWhat Goblin Slayer--the show--does, is strip everything down to its very basic elements and present something simple and blunt, and that\u2019s what makes it a hilariously amusing show.  Goblin Slayer--the character--this is getting out of hand--has a brutal honesty and charisma more dull than his armor.  See, this guy is not just A goblin slayer--he is THE Goblin Slayer, and the lengths of which his dedication go to are quite fascinating, and, honestly, really goddamn funny.  His entire brain is geared to destroy every goblin on the face of the Earth.  He constantly wears his armor \u201cjust in case\u201d, he only ever accepts quests that involve killing goblins, and he even mutters \u201cGoburin\u2026\u201d every now and then when he\u2019s about to embark on a quest.  It\u2019s like Ash Ketchum on the Genocide Route; it\u2019s a simple, childhood-like dream that\u2019s continued into adolescence and consumed everything about you.  He\u2019s a man on a goddamn mission.\\n\\n\r\nAnd when I say this anime is funny, I don\u2019t just mean \u201cha ha, graphic violence, what a spectacle!\u201d like I normally do.  Although, that is pretty funny tbh.  But I truly, genuinely think that Goblin Slayer presents itself as a comedic show many times throughout its run.  With things like Goblin Slayer\u2019s--goddammit it, this is hard to express--MC-kun\u2019s blunt personality will create some funny back-and-forths with the characters he regularly parties with later into the show. \\n\\n\r\n\u201cWhat is that?\u201d says the Elf, gazing upon the birdcage which this Undyne-looking motherfucker is holding.\\n\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know what a bird is?\u201d he replies.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s that Sheldon Cooper, possibly autistic mentality that makes him enjoyable.  His inability to properly communicate with other people lead him to say things so sharply honest that it has a witty sensation, and as you\u2019d expect, it has an effect on the people he interacts with.  In a scene where Goblin Slayer\u2019s party--he forms a party, by the way--gives their own noble speeches about why they became adventurers and what it means to them, they circle around to Goblin Slayer, who begins to say the usual \u201cto slay Goblins\u201d, he gets cut-off mid-sentence by the Elf, essentially saying \u201cyeah, we fucking know.\u201d  And that one scene with the Sword Maiden. . . do I even need to explain why that\u2019s funny?\\n\\n\r\nAnd when I say--shit I already said that. Oh well.\\n\\n\r\nAnd when I say this anime is stripped down to its basics, that\u2019s not me being reductive.  That\u2019s not a 0IQ comment of \u201clol turn ur brain of cuz its dum!!1\u201d, I really mean that it\u2019s basic.  Every character in the show has a name that is exactly what they are.  The priestess is called Priestess.  The elf is called Elf.  The hot receptionist waifu is Guild Girl.  The girl with big titties is Cow Girl.  The setting has room for full exploration, but chooses to focus on this one little story instead.  You know the template isekai plotline of \u201cI\u2019m the main character and I need to defeat the Demon King God Emperor Overlord!!\u201d Well, that happens in the world of Goblin Slayer.  The big boss is actually defeated.  Not by the Goblin Slayer himself, mind you, but by a completely unrelated character known as The Hero.  Imagine that.  The world has more areas to explore.  Adventuring is a given; ranks are awarded to those who succeed, and many other characters do as such.  But, among all that, this anime is about one thing and one thing only: a guy who just really likes to kill goblins.\\n\\n\r\nI commend this story for sticking to such basics.  Say what you will about it, but it doesn\u2019t ever stray off its path.  It\u2019s delivered just as advertised, no refunds allowed.  If you want a more expansive fantasy, that\u2019s fine.  But Goblin Slayer never, ever promised to deliver that, and it really doesn\u2019t have to.  Not every fantasy needs to have the long, thorough exploration of One Piece.  Not every conflict has to have the moral greyness of Shinsekai yori.  If you don\u2019t like that, well, you should probably just watch another show instead of bitching about this one.  It din\u2019du nuffin\u2019.\\n\\n\r\nFor what it\u2019s worth, Gobby Gobby Kill-Time has a surprisingly believable world.  Mr. Slayer isn\u2019t a character who is worshipped and respected.  He\u2019s not a self-insert made to look badass.  He\u2019s a fucking weirdo and is treated as such.  Other adventurers look down on him, gossiping about his disgusting habits: not ever cleaning his armor, never talking to anyone and only taking the most redundant of quests despite his Silver ranking being quite high up the board.  His job is not admirable.  \\n\\n\r\nDespite that, there are people who believe in him.  There\u2019s his cow-titted sister or what the fuck ever who appreciates his work.  Priestess was initially saved by him, and follows him around to not only learn various things as an adventurer, but to also normalize him as a person.  Elf and the others--actually, I forgot why they\u2019re there.  Oops.  And then the receptionist waifu commends him for his dedication in one of the anime\u2019s most underrated moments, where she expresses her appreciation for doing the things he does.  Because, at the end of the day, it\u2019s a job that needs to be done, even if it sucks, even if no one wants to do it, something that many people can likely relate to.  \\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s no bullshit.  No real asspulls or crazy powers.  The anime has a good sense of rules, balance and logic for its battles.  Different weapons are used depending on the environment; magic has very limited usage, items are consumed in very specific circumstances with preservation in mind, and many different approaches are used to killing goblins.  Do they storm into a nest and rampage through them all, or do they lay traps and smoke them out?  How do they deal with an ambush, or a boss?  And better yet, what happens when shit really hits the fan?  This party isn\u2019t perfect, and there\u2019s a threat of very not good things constantly lurking.  While I wouldn\u2019t say Goblin Slayer has any real strokes of genius with its combat, it certainly gets the job done well enough to make it a believable and interesting enough action series.\\n\\n\r\nGoblin Slayer is a fun show.  It\u2019s as simple-minded as the title implies and plays the role it signed up for.  It\u2019s a very simple action/adventure series with an edgy streak to it, but please note that it\u2019s really not the edgiest thing in the world or even really this season like holy fuck watch Golden Kamuy you fucking cotton-humpers.  Anyway, at the end of the day, it might seem strange; I\u2019m giving this a positive review but also saying it\u2019s not that big of a deal.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s because it isn\u2019t.  Y\u2019all just need to calm down.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\r\nArt: 4/10\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nGoblins: Dead/10\\n\r\nOverall: 7.5/10 (Range: 6.0-8.0)\\n\\n\r\nThese are bonus sections because they don\u2019t really add anything to what I was saying, but some people might still care for some reason.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is mud.  Rapist Slayer Guy is CG in some scenes and not CG in others.  It doesn\u2019t look good when he is, and the fact that he isn\u2019t all the time makes it very weirdly inconsistent.  The director sometimes does good things, but also tries a little too hard to make some shots look cool; it\u2019s very hit-or miss.  There's also a countless number of horribly tacked-on blood splatters that makes every kill look hilarious.  The backgrounds are nothing to write home about and the setting itself is pretty generic, but the character designs are actually quite good.  Mr. Slayer has a cool red eye for when he gets cereal and Priestess-chan can get the dick; I\u2019d go as far as to say they look iconic for how strong their designs are.  Elf has some cool, sharp features and Lizardman looks pretty rad.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP has one of the most interesting songs that I\u2019ve heard in anime this year, to the point where White Fox seemed pretty clueless as to how to animate it.  Some of the shots feel very strangely timed and there\u2019s little consistency to its visual themes.  Still, the song alone makes it a great OP with its somber introduction going into mysterious vocal melodies, crescendoing into an action-packed verse until it lets out a long vocal stream, layered over another melody about wanting to kill goblins and shit.  It\u2019s actually really well-written, but the percussion sounds like someone farted on the audio waves somehow because it sounds like shit.  The ED sucks.\\n\\n\r\nWatch SSSS.Gridman.",

            "content": "Goblin Slayer is an anime that everyone can enjoy.\r\nFollowing a badass computer-generized protagonist slaying mobs of goblins like the pests they are, it encourages every person watching to take arms, get active and do something with your life. Our man got cucked in his backstory by a dozen goblins and now he doesn\u2019t give a flying f*** no more. Now he slays goblins and women on the daily. What other guy do you know in this show that got healed through taking a virgin\u2019s purity? I\u2019ll wait\u2026\r\nThe priestess first joins a group of no-hope losers with no understanding of what a potion is, and asexpected, they are beaten, bloodied and booted from the show, but the Priestess ends up saved by Lord Slayer-kun and just like real life attraction, the girl is taken for her hero and follows him everywhere. She would follow the MC to the ends of the Earth if only to prove her worth to him. Now that\u2019s something every man on the planet can learn from, instead of wasting hard earned money on false prophets like PrankInvasion teaching you how to kiss women on the streets by practicing on a pillow.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is subtly brilliant with depicting Lord Slayer-kun in a completely different animation style, further showing how much more advanced of a person he is compared to every other character in the show. The red eye symbol is kind of dumb as he has two eyes but I\u2019m being nitpicky here.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound, well I\u2019ll be honest, it sucks but you have the option to mute every episode so that renders this part of the review proof.\\n\r\nI\u2019m amazed how in a year that completely disappointed with trash after trash after trash after trash after trash, finally there is a show that can inspire everyone to be a better person. Maybe I\u2019m just optimistic, but everyone has at least the chance to watch how an alpha male goes about his business\\n\\n\r\n\u201cThe only good [losers] are the ones who never come out of their [mothers basement]\u201d\\n",

            "content": "It\u2019s safe to say that if it weren\u2019t for series such as \u201cConception\u201d and \u201cMy Sister, My Writer\u201d airing this Fall, then Goblin Slayer, without a shadow of a doubt, would take home the title of \u201cWorst Anime of the Season.\u201d It\u2019s an anime that yearns to be Berserk but fails miserably. An anime that sacrifices everything in service of a threadbare plot with zero long-term emotional impact, along with gratuitous fanservice and surface level vileness for vileness\u2019s sake. It's the classic case of trying to have its cake and eat it too, which is very telling in its premiere episode that caused one ofthe most controversial moments in recent time\u2014in order to vilify the enemies in this story and darken its tone from a seemingly happy-go-lucky JRPG world, it gave every excuse possible to use rape as a shock factor to hook viewers in\u2014It\u2019s actually woven into every fabric of the story that it is literally impossible to avoid talking about rape when discussing Goblin Slayer. \\n\\n\r\nThe writing is beyond abysmal that there are numerous contradictions in its worldbuilding that is so glaring that it cannot be ignored. In addition to this, every character is one-dimensional and so generic to the point of being incapable of having a moment of introspection, having personal goals that don\u2019t revolve around the main protagonist, and they have no names since the author states in an interview that he is bad with them. So, the characters are referred to, as their character classes since this fantasy is set up like a tabletop RPG. Being the cardboard cut-outs that they are, almost the entirety of their dialogue consists of only talking about the main hero of the story and his goblin quests, his name is\u2014get this\u2014Goblin Slayer (will refer to him as GS). He\u2019s a stoic man, barely says a sentence, hardly ever takes his armour and helmet off, and is your typical Marty-Stu who overcomes the impossible, and has a harem of anime beauties that love him for the shallowest of reasons. His only defining characteristic is his edgy glowing red eye.\\n\\n\r\nNot only does the audience have to suffer through these plastic characters but also the villains are alike, which are the goblins. These creatures represent the evil of the world and their purpose is to simply destroy and multiply. This is where the story and worldbuilding reach the lowest depths of terrible writing. The goblins are underestimated in this world and acknowledged as a non-priority, despite these inworld facts: The first being that goblins are weak and a low threat; they have the size, strength and intelligence of human children. The second being, goblins are well known to be dangerous; they massacre, rape and pillage, some can even cast deadly spells. If goblins are so weak and stupid that a normal villager is capable of killing one, then how can they do everything in the second inworld fact? Why does the show continue to preach how goblins are level 1 mob but also tell us how history and current time teaches about the notoriety of the goblins? It is later explained that goblins can evolve into higher classes if they live long enough where they will gain experience, learn to organize. This contradicts the first inworld fact\u2014let's say for argument's sake, it\u2019s an unreliable piece of information, then how is it possible for the population to believe something so contradictory to the fact of the world?\\n\\n\r\nGoblins have an immediate impact on the citizens as well as its economics. A villager gets pushed aside despite begging the guild and government for adventurer and military aid to defend their hamlets and farms from hordes of goblins, but since this incoherent story makes them out to be a small issue, he gets ignored. The adventurers wouldn\u2019t do it for free either since they are all assholes who only do things for money and glory. It makes you question the common sense, ethics and morality of this world. Especially when the villagers are responsible for the farming\u2014crops and livestock, mining, crafting and architecture. If you remove GS from the story, it collapses straight away since he is the only person who takes these quests besides rookies, who basically end up dead as mention by the guild. Why are they underestimated when the majority of new adventurers, who take on goblin quests, die? How can the world remain this na\u00efve when this occurrence is frequent and goblin attacks are so abundant? It literally makes zero sense. With GS out of the picture, all the goblin nests shown in the story, multiply to insane numbers, the goblins will gain experience and evolve, led by more Goblin Lords and will pillage all the hamlets and farms, raped numerous women and eventually take over the main towns.\\n\\n\r\nI don't get the reasoning made for goblins to rape. Yes, I understand in the story that they have to use females from other races to procreate since they are all born males, but that's the Thermian Fallacy! I'm asking specifically the logic behind this from a meta point of view. The author made them beings of pure evil to cause chaos and pain but gives them the glaring oversight of needing other race's females to reproduce. And from a serious narrative point of view, this only serves as a way to make goblins seem bad, e.g. \u201cGoblins are bad, rape is bad, so goblins rape!\u201d This is the main logic behind the reasoning given. It was a way to depict the goblins as spawns of evil and to establish that this is a dark and cruel world. The issue here is that having the goblins suddenly raping women is really unnecessary to achieve that goal, the story acts as if murder or torture is incapable of doing so. An obvious sign that values being dark and shocking over telling a story. The way they use rape is to make this show artificially darker for no reason other than being edgy - and that is what rape essentially is in Goblin Slayer, cheap shock value! \\n\\n\r\nIt is very rare for any fiction to be able to use rape to darken the tone of its world without turning that work into smut. If dark elements like rape could be removed and the story would be exactly the same, then those elements shouldn\u2019t be here, to begin with. Relying on artificially added darkness only makes Goblin Slayer's story a piece of trash, far from mature and smart. Especially when these dark elements are selectively applied to everyone outside of GS bubble of happy-go-lucky JRPG world with his harem of anime beauties, which none of them gets raped during the current storyline. While everyone else is living in the goblin rape house game. At least Berserk has enough inworld consistency to subject important characters to the carnage. No, I'm not saying that equally raping everyone makes a better story but there is no consistency in the world of Goblin Slayer. In Berserk, rape is a reality that everyone may encounter. It is a clear message that the characters are squarely operating within the world's rules. It is not done frivolously either because the events did not put them out of the picture like some used goods. They become survivors and turned it into a narrative of strength and recovery, adding to their characters depth. They are trying to not let the act define them forever. And this is exactly where Goblin Slayer shamefully stumbles on, it\u2019s an embarrassment to the fantasy genre and the anime fandom.\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned previously, the world is set up like a tabletop RPG. The \u201cgods\u201d created this world from the bottom up, made the laws and rules, designed and created everything. Every piece on the board represents a character. The gods did this out of boredom, they play the game similar to the likes of D&D where they roll the dice to determine the fates of the people of this world. For some odd reason, GS is the only piece on the board that is able to negate their dice roll on him, effectively ignoring the laws and logic despite rolling a nat 1 himself. GS is a powerhouse walking Deus ex Machina while also being the pinnacle of a Marty-Stu, a character who constantly peaks at the script to have all the essential knowledge and sources to overcome any obstacle in his path. Even in times when the story makes his plot armour as thin as possible, there is no tension. The one time where viewers felt that there would finally be consequences was resolved by off-screen healing magic which required GS to sleep with a naked, underage virgin (Deus ex Machina) without previously mentioning such a spell.\\n\\n\r\nIf there is one thing Goblin Slayer executed \u2018well\u2019 was the amount of unnecessary fanservice. Every woman in this story is some sexy bombshell with gigantic funbags or a breathing kawaii anime troupe. Studio White Fox ended up adapting Kumo Kagyuu and Noburu Kannatsuki\u2019s horrible manga and light novel. The animation was poor, a lot of recycled sequences, especially for GS and the goblins. Terrible use of CG on GS that reach the highest levels of cringe imaginable. Most of the blood and goblins themselves were CG. The character designs were unoriginal, basically ripping off characters from Fate Stay, Berserk and Sword Art Online. The score was weak, soundtracks cutting off abruptly during transitions and the seiyuus couldn\u2019t shine with the lacklustre script they had. There was even a recap after episode 10 which is very telling on how well White Fox really did, basically, they raise the white flag. Watching that recap would be recommended instead of viewing episodes 1-10 as you would not miss anything, and it would save you a lot of time.\\n\\n\r\nGoblin Slayer tries to make other factors feel important like legendary heroes, demons, dragons and all these things that are shown in snippets, much later in the series. When you see them, it honestly feels like you\u2019re watching a completely different anime. There is a huge disconnect here since the story spends its time delving into one man\u2019s struggle against this dreadful set of circumstances. Which means every other aspect of the show is a failure as it is not explored, they are not in service to the premise so they become nothing more than distractions\u2014yet another sign of bad writing. This show has more problems, such as cinema narrative dissonance; the story being told visually does not agree with the story being told by the script. A perfect example is when the show finally attempts to explore the psychological trauma and PTSD of a victim of rape, which was completely ignored for most of the story. While the Sword-Maiden is telling her experience, the shot composition is dedicated to her bouncing tits and stiff nips. It is titillating, with various camera angles and lingering shots. And it happens twice, the second time having her also trying to seduce GS as she was portrayed as one of the shows many whores. Doesn't it occur to anyone that the atmosphere, the scenery and the fanservice are undermining the actual tone of what it's trying to tell you as the audience? \\n\\n\r\nIn summary, Goblin Slayer is worse than a poor mans\u2019 Berserk, in fact, it shouldn\u2019t even be compared to it. It\u2019s a culmination of every poorly written fantasy rolled into one with high levels of exploitative sexual violence, used to shock the audience into thinking they are watching some mature and deep piece of media. The story (lack of it) and characters (who lack characterization) cannot hold together without GS. Remove him out of the picture and everything collapses. When you can imagine the cast of \u201cNo Game No Life\u201d doing the happy-go-lucky, slice-of-life elements that are in this show is when your suspension of disbelief has evaporated. It manages to insult your intelligence and also on a personal level with all its nonsensical gibberish. There is just no redeeming quality in this clusterfuck called Goblin Slayer, an abominable series whose legacy will be its controversial first episode, and won\u2019t be remembered by anything outside of it, which practically makes it a wet dream for edgelords.\\n",

            "content": "Goblin Slayer is one of the few anime which raised my hype from '0' to 'maximum'. Only Nozoki-Ana (ok there was only an OVA & a 130+ chapters manga) and  Yamada-kun to 7-nin no Majo managed (12 episodes anime + 2x30 min OVA & 240+ chapters manga) to do the same. Indeed, when I started watching GS, I immediatly switched to the manga (both original & prequel) right after latest episode finished airing. Time to read the Light novel now that I received my GS wall poster.\r\nTalking more seriously : Goblin Slayer first shows itself as a dark / violent / horrific anime (everyonewho watched episode 1 only would answer that). However, it quickly turns out to become softer, to please a bigger audience I guess. For anyone interested in a more cruel, darker & disgusting version of the story, you should take a look at the manga or the light novel : they might give you chills thinking about how bestial are the goblins. Not as dumb or weak as showed in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot isn't complicated and the major points of the anime are : its characters & its fights. Even though I have to add that you shouldn't expect a deep developpment of the characters... they don't even have names (people usually using words like High Elf Archer (HEA) or Anvil ; Priestest, GS, Guild Girl (GG), SpearMan (SM) etc... to design them). Nevertheless it won't impeach you to find a catch for them, considering they are more normal & close to you than you think, despite the environment, magic and universe. As I read, the author intended to not give names because he saw his creation as a game of Dungeon & Dragons, so every players (in our case, viewers) could incarnate any character.\\n\\n\r\nBasically, it was a beasts / monsters VS Humanity story, and you will take the second one's side for sure. The anime gives you a hatred towards those filthy creatures and makes you enjoying every new massacre ! Especially the last arc, that was critized at first because it shouldn't be taking place at the end but more like at the beginning. Anyway, it was a really nice idea to swap arcs, in order to provide the viewers an amazing ending. It also officially announces a second season, even if the manga content can't afford it... YET !\\n\\n\r\nFinally, a great show with a taste of violence in a darker universe. Definitely the one you should have watched during Fall 2018 if you like this genre. I placed it within my Top 3 favorite Fall 2018 anime, alongside with Zombieland Saga & SSSS.Gridman. I highly encourage everyone to watch the show then read the manga (if you are hardcore fan, even read the light novel !).",

At first I thought it would just be some gory and edgy anime about a guy who kills goblins (My assumption wasnt that far from what it is), but it turns out there is way more to it than just that!\r\nBefore watching the anime, I thought the story would just be something stupid and ridiculous, but it turns out there is a real motive to all of it. \r\nThere was quite a controvery with the first episode of Goblin Slayer,due to the amount of gore and especially that one rape scene. But this was indeed all necesarry to understand the situation thats going on. It aint all fun and games in a fantasy world.\\n\r\nAs a Manga reader, the story itself is really interesting and really enjoyable, but at the same time its pretty gory (Not on the level of \"Berserk\" though), so if you aint into gore or violence then this anime isnt for you.\\n\r\nI also love the art style, the only thing I dont like about it is the CG for the main character every now and then, but other than that, its all pretty cool. The soundtrack is also great! The OP is actually in English which is nice to see in animes everynow and then.\\n\r\nIn the end, I rate this anime a solid 9/10. Really enjoyable! Great story! Awesome characters! Go ahead and give it a watch, unless you aint into gore. <3",

            "content": "Overview:\r\n2018 was an odd year for anime. We started the year with sky high hopes for Yuasa helming a Devilman adaptation. That ended up just kind of meh and underwhelming on every level since the oil and water dynamic between Yuasa and Nagai just didn't work out.  \r\nWe FINALLY got a sequel to FLCL...and everyone hated it. We got a reboot of Galactic Heroes using pretty boy characters and CGI space battles, which is currrently rated like shit here on MAL. \r\nWe also saw a strong resurgence of shock value anime and edge starting in late 2017 and continuing into this year. Last year,we got the tasteless and utterly trash Inuyashiki and King's game. This year we got Magical Girl Site, Happy Sugar Life, and today's subject: Goblin Slayer.\\n\\n\r\nGoblin Slayer is in a way a perfect encapsulation of anime in 2018. From the bland characters to edgy writing to horrible CGI, what better series to symbolize what may be the worst anime year in decades?\\n\\n\r\nPlot:\\n\\n\r\nGoblin Slayer takes place in a world that operates similar to an MMORPG. Once you reach around 14 years old, you become an adventurer. You must go around slaying monsters and finding treasure in order to level up and achieve new ranks within society. Monster slaying quests are handled by the guild, who are fucking terrible at their jobs. The guild sends out poorly trained children to slay monsters they often aren't prepared for with no warnings or hesitation. Our deuteragonist is a young priestess whose entire party get brutally killed and raped by goblins in just the first episode. She and her party were essentially level 3 and the goblins are level 3-5 with some of the tougher ones around level 10. They had no chance from the beginning and the guild apparently knew this and didn't care. Oddly enough, the guild's criminal negligence and high mortality rate is never explored. Fortunately, she is saved by Silver Rank adventurer who is the equivalent of level 60 or so. This guy despite his high level has dedicated his entire life to killing every last goblin. Goblins killed and raped his family, so now he is the titular Goblin Slayer. It's like if Goku was so enraged that Saibamen killed Yamcha that he spent the rest of DBZ flying across the galaxy killing every last Saibaman! What a grand adventure!\\n\\n\r\nThe odd thing is that the Goblin Slayer is actually the sane one. While everyone else longs for grand adventures overseas slaying dragons and exotic demons, nobody is addressing the Goblin infestation at home. As a result, entire towns and cities are getting annihilated by goblins and the human population in the light novels is stated to be in decline while the goblin population is rising exponentially. Humanity is being threatened with extinction and only the Goblin Slayer cares! Everyone else seems perfectly happy with letting the Goblins rape and slaughter their families. If this were written in Trump's America, people would immediately suspect it's a heavyhanded allegory for immigration written by some far right jackass. That's not actually what Goblin Slayer is. Sadly, the answer is just as dumb. It never really explains this in the anime, but apparently the world of Goblin Slayer was created by a D&D campaign with the 4 \"Gods\" just being 4 neckbeards. The reason everyone besides the Goblin Slayer is a moron is that the Dungeon Master is far more competent than the 3 rookie players. However, they forgot about the character of the \"Goblin Slayer\" and that's why he still has free will while the strongest heroes are being controlled by the incompetent rookies. It's like a 6th grader trying to rip off something the comic writer Grant Morrison would do.\\n\\n\r\nThe tragic but hilarious thing is that Goblin Slayer didn't need to be this bad! It would have been mediocre but acceptable if it was just a 15 year old writing bad Berserk fanfiction. We all know the light novels exist SOLELY because the author was so enamored with with the troll arc in Berserk. Sadly, not every episode is like the first. Most of Goblin Slayer is actually bad humor, bad fanservice that doesn't even show tits, and whole episodes of NOTHING happening. I've seen some SLOW anime, but Goblin Slayer can be just as slow as any despite the fact it's supposed to be a mindless, cathartic action show about slaying goblins! My offline friends are all American comic fans that have what MAL would call \"casual\" taste. They watch stuff like Slayers, Code Geass, Fairy Tail, Overlord, and My Hero Academia. It can be pretty awkward for me to explain that I'm watching a show about girls who're slowly learning to be better gondola tour guides in space Italy. People ask \"why in the FUCK would you watch something that boring?! Yet somehow, half the episodes of Goblin Slayer are more boring than any episode of Aria. They managed to make slaying hordes of goblins more boring than watching someone learn to row a gondola. Even the climactic battle at the end of the series is boring. It ends up being around 100 B, A, and S class warriors vs 200 little goblins and 10 slightly bigger goblins. It's a one sided curb stomp battle just like basically every battle in this series! Instead of watching the anime version of Helm's Deep, I find myself chanting \"THIS IS BORING! (Clap Clap ClapClapClap)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\n\"Ah...I see\" - Goburin Srayer Sama\\n\\n\r\nThe characters might actually be the worst part of Goblin Slayer. Every character is purely one dimensional and is defined by 1 trait. Goblin Slayer hates goblins and he slays them. That is his raison d'etre. That's as deep as we get into his character. Priestess girl is a support healer and her role is to offer support to Goblin Slayer. We don't know anything of her likes, dislikes, hopes or dreams. She exists to help Goblin Slayer. Dwarf likes to drink and hates elves because Tolkien. The Elf likes archery and hates dwarves because Tolkien. Lizard man likes cheese. The characters really aren't any deeper than this. All fictional characters lack the immense complexity of real people. That's a fundamental truth of writing. However, if they're interesting to us then we begin to fill in their inner thoughts, motivations, and we add sub-text. I just can't see anyone doing that with the Goblin Slayer cast. There is simply nothing interesting about ANY of these characters.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this anime is just butt ugly or \"boogly\" if you will. The CGI isn't quite as bad as Berserk 2016 or 2017, but it is still just depressing to look at. I was rewatching Stand Alone Complex recently and noticed the CGI in that series has aged poorly, but modern anime CG just isn't much better. The quality of American CGI animation has grown exponentially better in the last 20 years. We had a BAD phase around the year 2000 when we were putting out cartoons like Butt Ugly Martians, but America got beyond that early stumbling phase. Since anime has much tighter schedules and tighter budgets, the CGI never really improved that much. There are rare exceptions like Advent Children, Gantz 0, and King's Glaive. However, I would argure that CGI as a whole has been overwhelmingly detrimental to anime. When CG use is limited like the Stands in JoJo or explosions in Hellsing Ultimate, or even the vectors in Elfen Lied, it can be passable with a small budget. When you try use CGI as a lazy crutch like the Berserk reboots or Goblin Slayer, it gets BAD. Basically, use CG very sparingly unless you have a lot of time and/or a massive budget.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nPeople have asked me, \"Is Goblin Slayer really that bad?\" Honestly, the answer is Yes. It really is that bad. Even Inuyashiki had the anime Trump speech. I can only think of maybe one scene in all of Goblin Slayer that made me smile. A priestess who was raped by goblins asks the Goblin Slayer to have pity sex with her since men will no longer go near her. He just shuts her down in the most deadpan manner with a line like \"I'm not here to cuddle! I just slay Goblins dude! Now if you need any goblins slain, THEN I can help you!\" When that exchange is the best part of your entire anime, you deserve that 2 out of 10. Goblin Slayer isn't my vote for worst anime of year. That would be Magical Girl Site. However, it is still an atrocious anime and a complete waste of your time. No matter how much people talk about it online, I would recommend skipping this one.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Review on the first 4 episodes.\r\nThe very first episode set a very strong impression. I feel that a lot of people forgot all about how we recently survived an era of very uninspired and generic isekai / fantasy anime, then when Goblin Slayer emphasized the presence of these tropes viewers didn't see it as the intended bait and switch - they only saw the bait. So many shows, including large amounts of battle-magic-highschool anime from eras passed had main characters who were very one note just like Priestess appeared to be for our first impression before actually digging into what a blindly optimistic and faithfulhealer would think during these adventures. What resulted in the first episode's premier was a lot of lazy criticism.\\n\\n\r\nWhat also followed were several debates about how the goblins are just a plot device (or shallow), whether or not it's fine for an antagonist to be just a device or if it's good story structure to have the antagonist(s) vilified first. To anyone who argues either of these points, do keep in mind that man vs nature is a very popular trope found in several stories - and very many fun action movies have villains serve as bowling pins for the main character to defeat. One other popular arguing point was the \"throw-away\" characters presented in the show also being shallow and not well introduced, but many people forget about several shows that are praised doing something very similar to Attack on Titan.\\n\\n\r\nNow to critique the show instead of critiquing the critique; \\n\\n\r\nWhat I find the most exciting is the presentation of our main character, Goblin Slayer. The common fantasy main-character is usually plucky, well spirited, and adventurous, usually getting out of situations with his sheer force of will or special talent against an unknown enemy after we're grown to \"love\" him from a sad, characterizing flashback. Goblin Slayer is the exact antithesis to this. He is practical, calculated, imaginative, and knows his enemy very well while his origins are unknown. On top of that, rather than being a charismatic character the people around him are drawn to, Goblin Slayer is shown to be less capable of socializing and is someone who needs to heal overtime - a more believable character to put it simply. The main character alone was enough to intrigue me to invest in this show.\\n\\n\r\nThere's no denying that Goblin Slayer isn't what most people would call a high art, the next Gurren Lagann or Berserk, but the show very much serves its purpose as a fun adventure series or a fun subversion of generic fantasy anime. You wouldn't grade a fish on how it climbs a tree so to speak.\\n\\n\r\nScores\\n\\n\r\nStory (7): A simple but functional story that's been painted out from the first couple of episodes, and seems to be a slow-cook to a satisfying character-driven ending. However the second episode prompted debates about how Goblin Slayer's flashback served the story. On one hand the lack of episode one characterization was what many critics disliked of the show, but on the other hand it served extremely well to have our main character seem ambiguous and ominous. \\n\\n\r\nArt (7): Functional. The many sets feel very lived in with a great sense of space, along with thought-out details that goes into even dank caves, ruins, or meeting rooms. But the sets do lack textures in some portions and it doesn't live up to many contemporaries. The character designs on the other hand are very distinct and the action in the very first episode is very satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nSound (6): Once again, functional. Nothing about the soundtrack stands out one bit and the sound effects for the action scenes are appropriate at best. Nothing feels inventive or experimental and the action could gain more weight with better sound design.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (10): As I mentioned above, it is fantastic to have a main character who's the exact antithesis of plain, generic, insulting, isekai shows we've had to suffer through. The side characters have plenty of small moments too which characterizes them very well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10): Should be plain to see through my praise from before. I've actually found myself jumping in my chair the moment a new episode is posted, and it's fantastic to see the niche of fans from the Manga / Light novel coming out of the woodwork. I've also loved the many conversations and discussion after every episode.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 40/50 (8): A very satisfying show for people who like character-driven shows with moments of intrigue and seeing someone prevail with wit over strength. Goblin Slayer is a very firm suggestion should someone be okay with the graphic nature.",

            "content": "Goblin Slayer is a unique fantasy story about paranoid mentally broken wierdo who wants to commit genocide on a green raping barbarians. In a Dungeon&Dragons setting using homerules.\r\nIs it Dark Fantasy? Yeah, sort of, BUT NO BECAUSE OF  \"MUH RAPE\", you goddamn millennials, but because in the world of GS you are a pawn in the hands of Gods, you will die when  certainGod roll D20=1 and you can do nothing about it. You cannot win because Gods, eventually, will create another scenario where demon lord resurrected or necromancers destroy your hometown or goblins destroy your village. But you also cannot loose, becauseGods will also spawn heroes on your side who will keep balance and endless war going.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory - Anime is retelling events of first 2 volumes of ranobe (or light novel, who cares), cutting worldbuilng, character thoughts and 70% of details. Thats pretty sad but without full season necessary. \\n\r\nIts always very simple on surface - GS on a quest to kill some goblins (you dont get to see his routine, only the epic quests shown), but its always a different place, different threat level, different boss. And its not just \"goblins sitting in dungeon waiting to be slaughtered\", they are planning some bad things. So while it looks like a simple goblin slaying there is always something more, but I dont wanna spoil things.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt - meh, from pretty good to \"ahaha oh wow\". Better use your imagination (your strongest weapon) while reading source material, or AT LEAST manga. \\n\\n\r\nSound - every theme fits the situation and place, from peaceful town/guild music to intense \"overcoming the odds\" battle themes. I am just waiting full OST release, cant fully judge it now.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nGS - your main character. People's hero, defender of frontier villages from green shits, a silver ranked (third rank) adventurer who is actually obsidian (9 rank) in terms of strength, paranoid, autistic and simple man. Fighter+Ranger+Scout multiclass. Normalfags (both in his world and IRL viewers) dont understand him, but he doesnt care. Obsessed with guess what, and has a good reasons for it.\\n\r\nPriestess - second MC. Shy and kind girl in the beginning who will change A LOT in future. Idealistic, pretty strong magic caster for her level, one of the best female characters I've seen in like 10 years or so, with her own mind, motivations, strengths, weaknesses, without forced \"muh stronk independent wamen\" or being \"token appendix to MC (ahem, Asuna, ahem)\". True support who can carry whole party.\\n\r\nDwarf Shaman - typical dwarf, I would say, if typical dwarfs were magic casters. But they usually dont. In any case, if you love fantasy you probably love dwarfs - these short, sometimes drunk, sometimes grumpy, but loyal and honest folk are a great battle-bros, so nothing wrong with being \"typical dwarf\".\\n\r\nLizard Priest - one of the most serious (and probably strongest) party members. Lizardman is not a common species in a fantasy settings (usually they are just one of neutral secondary races who no one cares about), so seeing one is pretty refreshing. Wants to PURGE HERESY and become a Dragon. Isnt that a noble and relatable goal?\\n\r\nHigh Elf Archer - flat tsundere and normie, very young and optimistic (but you dont want to make her angry). Despite what animeonly thinks not a part of the harem (more on that later).\\n\r\nGuild Girl - older sister type character, competeting in GS-bowl with Cow Girl. Pretty cute in source material, but only a side-character in anime (I think Witch got more screentime than a Guild Girl).\\n\r\nCow Girl - choldhood friend (childhood friends never win, remember that). Yet again another victim of anime adaptation with no screen time or personality. Guess you have to read the fucking book if you care!\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nHere comes the most important. Why do people (and me) enjoy Goblin Slayer?\\n\r\n  1. Classic tropes done right - your typical fantasy setting, but without bullshit isekai OP characters, without subverting expectations (except for the \"goblin are stupid as kids\" part) and without trying to be more than it is.\\n\r\n  2. Rooting for underdogs. You see GS is weak as fuck compared to for example Lancer. So even if he fights the weakest monsters in the world he has to be careful and come up with new tactics and ideas. And if it wasnt enough there is always some greater threat that can smash and disintegrate our MC in 1x1 match. So even if you expect Goblin Slayer to prevail  from the beginning you never know how this battle will end.\\n\r\n  3. References. I fucking love references and there are A LOT OF THEM. Ignoring D&D part since its a part of the setting -\\n\r\nLord of the Rings (Orcrist-Orcbolg, master Bilbo, lembas)\\n\r\nWarhammer FB\\n\r\nDoom\\n\r\nBatman\\n\r\nPunisher\\n\r\nMini-Guts\\n\r\nMini-Lancer aka C\u00fa Chulainn\\n\r\nPlatinum hero Haruhi\\n\r\nAnd so on, its too hard to remember them all.\\n\r\n  4. Tonal shifts. What I heard many people complain about and getting it wrong. If you go full \"tea and cake party\" you get boring slice of life. If you go full \"blood and gore\" you get boring bloodbath. GS is about adventurers. Life of adventurer is about having fun while you can between the quests. Tomorrow you can die, but today you will laugh, drink and spend time with your party. What is the point of worrying about absolutely random dice rolls? Thats why tonal shifts are great and fit here. If you want 100% grimdark - watch some News channel or think about routine work you will have to do until you become old and sick. Pretty dark huh? Already want to forget  about it using good old \"tea and cakes\" method? So dont blame adventurers for distracting from routine stress.\\n\r\n  5. Compenent characters. At least most of them, but dont blame fucking noobs. You would also never expect that a level 1 giant rat can kill you when you start playing game.\\n\r\nAnd I am not even talking about Goblin Slayer, thats obvious part. The rest of his squad and even side characters (specially Lancer and Guts) has their own views and solutions to the problems. And most important that they respect each other views. So many stories show how MC knows everything better than anyone else, how he is perfect and others (mostly girls from harem) praise him. But here MC is experienced only when it comes to goblin slaying. Others use his knowledge and provide theirs.\\n\r\n  6. Romance. \"Oh look every girl like GS, bullshit stupid slice of life harem dropped\". Aaaaand you are wrong. A common mistake for a beginner. Its all about love triangle between Cow Girl and Guild Girl (and potentially Priestess). Why do they love him? Skip the childhood friend part since its obvious. Guild Girl knows him for 5 years. Thats a lot of time to become attached to someone. And Priestess can become more than apprentice, but thats not the point. Also there is a Sword Maiden but no one cares about her. 2(3) girls love one stoic, reliable and good-looking guy, do you still think its so unrealistic and stupid? I think it totally makes sense. Specially if you think about some abomination like SAO where girls fall in love with MC after 1 day of meeting him instead of 5+ years of knowing each other.\\n\r\n  7. The way Main party interacts with each other. Its hard to describe but you know what I mean if you played at least one game from Bioware, or any MMO with friendly guild.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - most of my enjoyment comes from ranobe or manga,  I've been reading GS for 2 years now, its just impossible to forget about it and judge only the anime. \\n\r\nBut think of this - my friend could not enjoy Overlord S2 and S3 after reading source material. He said that anime just ruined entire arc and I trust him. With Goblin Slayer I read the source material and I still could enjoy the anime adaptation even if it has a lot of flaws and cut content. That means that adaptation is good, while the source material is great.\\n\\n\r\nTHE CRIME IS YOUR FOUL EXISTENSE, GOBLIN, THE SENTECE IS DEATH!",

Jesus Christ, just stop it.  Take your pretentious, Tatami-Galaxy-loving-ass outta here, so us real fans can enjoy the kick-assery that is Goblin Slayer.\r\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.No.  I\u2019m serious, leave.  RIGHT NOW!  Only true fans will have the pleasure of reading this phenomenal review.  Shit, if you gave this series anything less than a \u201c10,\u201d you\u2019d best stop watching anime altogether, you wannabe-otaku.\r\n \u201cSo, where are thegoblins?\u201d \u2014 Goblin Slayer\\n\\n\r\nThe genius of Goblin Slayer comes from its uninhibited objective to underscore the savagery of the goblins; thereby, forcing the audience to immediately empathize with the lowly adventurers who\u2019s virginities will be forever lost to those disgusting green chodes.  The first episode may have been a bit overwhelming, but it was necessary to highlight the evil nature of the goblins.  And boy, were they ever evil.  But when all hope seemed lost, the vigilante known as Goblin Slayer entered the proverbial arena, to lay-the-smack-down on all their candy asses.  And layeth-the-smack-down he did.  Essentially, if you think about, he\u2019s the Japanese equivalent of Batman \u2014 mother f\u2014king BATMAN, people \u2014 set in a medieval world.  It\u2019s f\u2014king awesome!  But instead of breaking bones and scaring his foes psychologically, the Goblin Slayer just straight up murders those little dick-wads.\\n\\n\r\nAlong with his ruthless nature, the Goblin Slayer utilizes a myriad of techniques to kill goblins and keep the viewer entertained, including: curb-stomping goblin teeth against jagged rocks; rearranging goblin face\u2019s with his knuckles; splattering goblin brain matter across cave walls; shooting arrows through goblin eyeballs; and performing a mass genocide of all goblins, including the young-lins (NOT THE YOUNG-lins!).  Also, the Goblin Slayer\u2019s battle armor looks amazing, and his sturdy resolve to remain a \u201cgoblin-slayer,\u201d despite the ridicule of his fellow (ASSHOLES!) Compatriots was admirable.  His heart is filled with a deep hatred for those vile creatures, and people calling him an \u201cedge-lord\u201d simply don\u2019t understand how traumatizing of an experience he went through.  If the anime community had any inkling of what empathy was, then they would know what time it is.  But the Goblin Slayer knows: it\u2019s f\u2014king goblin-slaying time!  Amirite.\\n\\n\r\nThe genius of Goblin Slayer comes from the formation of a great coalition of diversified talents and people to accelerate the slaying of even more goblins.  Simply put, they paired the Goblin Slayer with a lizard-dude, a flat-chested elf, a geriatric dwarf, and Onna the high \u201cpriestess\u201d to go on a super-cool adventure to destroy an enormous goblin nest.  When the elf-girl used her magic to guide the single arrow through the two goblins and a wolf, I was straight up marking out.  Woooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!  (Ric Flair style).  But the episode wasn\u2019t over quite yet, because just as my erection was at its limit, they started playing epic rock music as the main crew walked towards the Goblin den with bad intentions, enough weapons to terrify the whole country of France, and a whole lot of awesomeness.  Schwing!!!!!!  Party time, bitches!\\n\\n\r\nBut, alas\u2026.it\u2019 not all good, dear friends (friends only include people who have Goblin Slayer in their favorites list).  Episode five deviated from the norm, omitting the Goblin Slayer\u2019s main objective in lieu of a silly side quest by some arbitrary character\u2019s.  EXCUSE ME!  Are we watching \u201cGoblin Slayer\u201d or \u201cPummel a Rat With a Giant Club Because You\u2019re Too Incompetent to Pull Your Sword From a Dead Rat Carcass\u2026Slayer?\u201d  The show, obviously, lost its focus, leaving the viewer in a deep pit of despair, wondering if the Goblin Slayer would ever resume his normal duties of goblin slaying (#depressed).  This sort of blunder would have been unforgivable, if not for the following episode when the MOTHER F\u2014KING Goblin Slayer lit those goblins up like a Christmas tree\u2026\u2026.wi-with his sword (it makes SENSE!).\\n\\n\r\nThe genius of Goblin Slayer comes from the application of Sun Tzu\u2019s, \u201cThe Art of War,\u201d via the Goblin Slayer\u2019s willingness to think like a goblin (i.e. \u201cTo know your enemy, you must become your enemy\u201d); hence, why the Goblin Slayer used goblin blood to conceal his own scent and displayed an indifferent, callousness during his various killing-sprees.  In addition, his level of perception to distinguish between goblins and non-goblins was especially on point, rarely finding himself in a situation where he cannot fulfill his goblin killing responsibilities.  Developments throughout the series highlight the contemplative side of the Goblin Slayer, as it\u2019s revealed that the internal goblins inside his head haunt him \u2014 \u201cBullshit.\u201d \u2014 inspire him to become enraged and go on the greatest goblin slaying spree of all time.\\n\\n\r\nThe genius of Goblin Slayer comes from its beautiful blend of \u201chappy,\u201d vibrant colors of the real world, juxtaposed with the dark, bloodcurdling atmosphere of the real-er world.  The contrast exemplifies the duality of life itself and how transient bliss can be supplanted by life long despair, due to circumstances that are beyond our control.  The Goblin Slayer experienced a fate worse than death, having witnessed the gang rape and eventual death of his sister.  Instead of acquiescing to his own fears, the Goblin Slayer hardened his resolve, choosing to never forgive the creatures that robbed him of his remaining family and his innocence.  The Goblin Slayer, himself, is not an exceptionally powerful warrior, nor is he blessed with unique gifts/powers that elevate him to the status of being \u201cone of a kind\u201d (perpetuating the Stock Sh\u014dnen Hero archetype).  What makes the Goblin Slayer \u201cspecial,\u201d is his devotion \u2014 some may call it, insanity \u2014 to exterminate every last goblin in existence and make no apologies about it.  Just as Michael Jordan etched his name in history as the G.O.A.T with his unmatched competitive fervor, the Goblin Slayer\u2019s inexorable zeal to eradicate his mortal enemy, is an unparalleled intensity that instills fear in his adversaries and certitude in his comrades.  \\n\\n\r\nThe genius of Goblin Slayer comes from the tactical vision and strategic planning of the Goblin Slayer.  His ability to foresee goblin battle plans and construct effective countermeasures, validates his meticulous nature and his profound cognitive capacity.  While other adventurers were caught off-guard by the goblin riders and the goblin champions, the Goblin Slayer, in all his clairvoyant glory, ensnared the repulsive creatures with his superior traps and delegation of responsibility; thus, paving the way for his final showdown with the Goblin Lord.  A showdown, in which the Goblin Slayer harnessed all his rage and pent-up frustration to fuel his fighting spirit to its absolute maximum.  \\n\\n\r\nSo why, you may ask, does the community hate the Goblin Slayer?  Detractors have argued that the Goblin Slayer\u2019s combative fury embodies the worst aspects of the \u201cUnstoppable Rage\u201d archetype.  You know, the same \u201cUnstoppable Rage\u201d every Sh\u014dnen hero experiences when they lose their shit and unlock a dormant power they never realized they had, until that very moment when they needed it most.  In addition, they claim that the excessive amount of fan-service has been rather excessive.  Excessive or not, the fan-service has been a point, with a plethora of great camera angles and side boob action to boot.  Lastly, they assert that none of the characters exhibit a genuine personality, or display any growth throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, these are just words, with a sprinkling of even bigger words (so many words).  And are we really going to accept the words of a bunch of salty bitches who conform to groupthink psychology, to avoid being ostracized by the anime \u201celitists\u201d for having \u201cshit-tastes?\u201d  I think NOT!!!  Why is that?\u2026\\n\\n\r\nBecause Goblin Slayer is the hero the MAL community deserves, but not the one it needs right now, so we\u2019ll ridicule him.  Because he can bear it, because he\u2019s not a hero.  He\u2019s a stoic defender, a warrior-savant, an ardent gladiator, a competitive eccentric, an iron-clad inspiration\u2026.\\n\\n\r\na GOBLIN SLAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYEERRRRRRRRRR!!!!!",

            "content": "Another fun little romp through fantasy-land, quests to be ventured and gold to be reaped... or maybe not quite. \r\nWelcome to 2018's most controversial anime, Goblin Slayer. Little known by western anime fans, it came much out of nowhere, with a first episode that made viewers aghast and the social medias ablaze. And why, you may ask. I will have to leave that unanswered for a moment, as you should not yet be reading this review if you are unfamiliar with what scene I am referring to. But I will leave a word of caution: you should probably not watch Goblin Slayer if you areeasily disturbed. \\n\\n\r\nSpoilers of the first episode, necessarily, will follow. \\n\\n\r\nWhat transpires in the first episode overshadows everything that comes in the following eleven episodes. And so, this review will be centered primarily on the first episode and its resulting controversy. Though I will also be discussing the artistic merits of the anime as a whole, this will be as much a critical analysis as it is a response, an answer of sorts to whether the controversy Goblin Slayer brewed ever had any meaning in the first place. \\n\\n\r\nAnd, I will tell you, no, it really did not.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the second episode onward, a 'viewer discretion' warning appears in the subtitles provided by Crunchy Roll. But nowhere does it appear in the show itself, in Japanese. It is quite clear who was actually offended by this show... and it was not the Japanese audience, for whom this anime was made.\\n\\n\r\nI'm going to be quite blunt, as this perception that westerners' views are always, unquestionably important is bothersome. Japanese anime studios do not care about what English-speaking YouTubers have to say, for they cannot even understand them in the first place. They do not care about Tumblr, nor do they care about anyone except viewers in Japan who could potentially buy BluRay discs of their series. They are companies, not political organisations. They are from Japan, not from the United States. The only thing the west could do to make an anime studio utter more than a flippant 'oops, sorry' is to have a spot on CNN or some other giant television network, in the same vein as the infamous adult game, 'Rapelay'. So, unfortunately, if you think yourself a sort of champion of justice, destined to rid the world of all portrayals and even mentions of rape, in countries you have never even visited and which do not share your beliefs\u2014 then, sorry to say, your words have fallen upon deaf ears.\\n\\n\r\nIf you have ever played a visual novel, read adult-oriented manga or watched an R-18 anime (and the Japanese audience for Goblin Slayer most certainly has), then sexual assault, as vile and irredeemable an act as it is, is not particularly unusual or shocking. I suppose it may be shocking in the context of Goblin Slayer being a TV anime, in which these sorts of acts are seldom depicted. But you also have to keep in mind that Goblin Slayer airs past midnight on a weekend, well into the usual watershed hours of western television. Kids are not meant to be watching this in the first place. And sexual assault is not rare in late-night anime so much because it is 'going overboard', but because the anime community in Japan is obsessed with the concept of virginity and do not take kindly to their imaginary characters being touched by a man other than them. Hence, the reason for why sex is not so much as mentioned in non-erotic anime, whether it be consensual or not. If sex is not graphically depicted (i.e. genitals showing and thrusting and all), then it is, generally speaking, safe to air past midnight on Japanese television. Goblin Slayer's now infamous scene, unpleasant as it is to watch, was not especially graphic. It did not black-out and fast-forward to the end as most anime do, and so while this scene is not entirely innocent (true, it is difficult to not feel at least a little bit sick in the stomach), it is hardly the traumatic viewing experience that some claim it to be. Say, for example, \"13 Reasons Why\", a western Netflix series, was far, far more graphic in its depiction of similar subjects and yet it was extremely popular among western teenagers, particularly females. But when an obscure late-night anime aimed at a completely different culture, and with drawings instead of real actors, tries to tread the same waters? Take it down. Take it all down, they say. Right. Good luck with that one. \\n\\n\r\nI suppose the deeper question, then, is whether these scenes were actually necessary. I highly doubt these scenes were meant to be erotic, to arouse its viewers when they were preceded by a brutal stabbing and a brutal massacre. And the attempted rape that follows the first is abominable enough that it defies any and all human logic, clearly meant to invoke deep feelings of hatred for goblins rather than a boner-pop and an \"oh yeah, baby, show me more.\" Goblin Slayer showed these scenes to create a sense of danger and to make you root for the titular character's, uh, titular slaying of said goblins. And fair enough. But equally fair is the question of why they chose rape in particular, rather than some other wretched act that would make you want to see goblin heads hitting the floor. Hatred was necessary for the story to continue, but not so much rape itself. My guess is the author chose that route because other fantasy series such as Re:Zero have already done the same with violence alone. The author wanted to set their series apart, to invoke a sort of hatred that anime-only viewers have rarely or perhaps never experienced before, and, well, the result of that is laid bare for all to see: angry westerners, and Japanese fans who just want to see some dead-ass goblins.\\n\\n\r\nIt is not so much from an artistic perspective that I am defending the author's choice, however. Gratuitous and pretentious, it is, when what follows in the later episodes is of little importance and does not in any meaningful way make use of the hatred instilled in the audience. Rather, it returns to the exact same silly and carefree tone of the anime's opening few minutes, as if it what happened in the first episode was just some sort of dream. Heck, the second episode may as well have been the beginning episode\u2014 the first completely obliterated from existence\u2014 and little would change at all with regards to the story and the characters. Goblin Slayer does not contain much in the way of themes other than 'goblins suck' and 'revenge begets revenge', and the trauma the heroine experienced during her first encounter is hardly touched upon or even acknowledged afterwards. Indeed, after an experience that horrifying, you would expect the heroine to, if nothing else, be apprehensive about another goblin slaying adventure, but by the next day she gives almost zero damns and throws herself to the protagonist's side merely because he is tough and can protect her, I guess? A bit of an idiot, indeed. Other characters will casually talk about their traumatic experiences as the camera pans lustfully over their breasts... almost as if it is a joke, making it pretty well clear the anime has no intention of taking these issues seriously. How are you supposed to care for characters that don't even know how to care about themselves? In the end, the main thing that sets the rest of the anime (everything sans the first episode) apart from any other fantasy series is the level of blood involved. Goblin Slayer is a strong dude, the heroine is cute, and screw goblins\u2014 there you go, Goblin Slayer's deep themes interpreted by yours truly. \\n\\n\r\nIf a darker fantasy anime in the lieu of Berserk is something you are clamoring for (as, well, there really are not a whole lot of them), then Goblin Slayer is if nothing else a serviceable adventure. The titular protagonist, Goblin Slayer, is essentially a more calm and composed version of Guts from Berserk: taciturn, a dark past, filled with hatred and a desire for vengeance, armor and all... albeit with a sword a size that humans can actually wield. His cold but logical manner of speaking are refreshing in a genre that is largely defined by self-righteous protagonists spouting idealistic nonsense. Goblin Slayer will save whom he can, but he is also capable of recognising the limits of his power and putting those with mortal wounds out of their misery. He knows that fighting requires planning and a clear head just as much as it requires strength. An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth is his way of living, but he does not try to moralise his lifestyle, instead believing that his endless lust for revenge makes him just as violent and as brutal as the goblins themselves. He has a sort of awareness and intellect that most anime protagonists lack, which makes the desolate world he lives in feel just a little bit more authentic. But those who are not a fan of darker or more morally ambiguous protagonists will only find the anime more unappealing with his presence. \"Edgy\", \"pretentious\", others might say. Considering that one's enjoyment of Goblin Slayer is almost entirely decided by their interest in the protagonist, and consequently his goblin slaying journey, those who do not find these sorts of characters appealing are well within their right to dislike the anime as a whole. But to say he is dark merely for the sake of being dark would be something of a lie. No, he is dark because he grew up in an awful world with rapey, murderous goblins. \\n\\n\r\nConsidering the natural path for most fantasy anime is to gradually hunt stronger and stronger monsters, the fact that Goblin Slayer is perpetually chasing weaker monsters\u2014 goblins\u2014 and even being ostracised for it by his fellow adventurers, is a refreshing change of pace for a genre that is often so predictable that you can already guess the events of the final episode based on the first. Sure, those in search of climactic fights may find themselves bored with an adventure that stays at largely the same difficulty level for its entire duration (with the rare boss battle here and there), but then again, how many times does one need to see a big bad dude or a dragon slain before they are satisfied? While most anime increase the stakes as the opponents get stronger, Goblin Slayer is able to portray weak little creatures as menacing, something few anime do, slimes and goblins brushed aside as if it is a necessity. The issue is that Goblin Slayer, despite it having a clear, singular focus with goblins as the villain, never really does or say a whole lot with them. They are almost entirely identical to one another, existing to rape, kill or be killed and little else. When the antagonist of a story lacks a motive and a personality, it's kinda hard to care much about where things go in the end. \\n\\n\r\nGoblin Slayer is neither horrible nor is it great. And sometimes it is both. Putting aside all the noise surrounding the series, and looking at it as a piece of fiction like any other, what is left is merely a decent dark-fantasy anime. Its artistic merit is hardly comparable to its big brother, Berserk, and while there are very severe issues afflicting the show, in a season where truly abysmal, irredeemable rubbish such as \"Ore ga Suki nano wa Imouto dakedo Imouto ja Nai\" has aired, Goblin Slayer is not what I could consider a bad anime. There's enough of interest here with the protagonist and the setting that I am at least considering reading the light novels in Japanese, where perhaps things are a bit better explained. Those regarding Goblin Slayer as the worst anime they've seen are more likely than not fishing for attention by exaggerating their opinions as much as possible. Either that, or they have just not watched a whole lot of anime, I would have to guess. \\n\\n\r\nBut to say I am a fan of Goblin Slayer, or that I even liked it would to be as dishonest as saying I hated it. My defense of Goblin Slayer is my defense of the author's right to artistic freedom. Being offended by this show is reasonable. Using said offense to try and shut down an author's livelihood, or to generalise an entire country of 130 million people as perverts or as morally bankrupt, is not. Some may even say it is despicable. And, you know, I think there is some truth in that. \\n\\n\r\nSo, feel free to watch Goblin Slayer if you enjoy dark-fantasy and have a tolerance for uncomfortable content. Or skip it, because truth told, Goblin Slayer was never really worth caring that much about in the first place.",

            "content": "\"Psst, kid, wanna roll some D20s?\"\r\nGoblin Slayer is a series that, paradoxically, is underrated because of how popular it is. Popularity means a wide audience, which means a wide array of stupid uninformed opinions that undersell a good work of fiction. Here is a shortlist of wrong statement about this show one might hear, as well as where those statements originate from: \r\n\u201cIt\u2019s edge-fest/fetishistic porn/literally neo-nazi propaganda\u201d - originates from sheltered, entitled life without any hardships plus never reading/watching any serious fiction, thus having no context whatsoever for how a dark/whatever show looks like. Goblin Slayer is just an ordinary R-rated show.\r\n\u201cIt baits you withgore and then becomes generic SoL\u201d - from sheltered, entitled life without any hardships plus never reading/watching any serious fiction, thus having a warped idea that to be \u201cmature\u201d a story needs a character getting killed/raped/eaten every 30 seconds, \u201cjust like it happens in real life\u201d.\\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a generic isekai\u201d - from thinking SAO invented fantasy anime and not knowing such words as \u201ctabletop\u201d or \u201cD&D\u201d.\\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bad adaptation\u201d - from not even knowing what medium the source material comes from, and mistakenly believing it\u2019s manga. Between manga and anime, the anime is a better adaptation of the original light novels. Alternatively, from fundamentally not understanding how \u201cadapting\u201d from one medium to another actually works.\\n\\n\r\nBrushing the nonsense aside, I want to emphasize what makes this show good:\\n\\n\r\nGoblin Slayer perfectly captures the spirit of a D&D campaign - that is, the spirit of murder-hoboing, with all the glorious total party kills, rule-lawyering and cheesing of the encounters. You can constantly see deliberately written moments where the players are implied to be rolling the dice, and how good of a roll that was based on the outcome.\\n\\n\r\nIt is a well-written dark fantasy in a market where this commodity is in deficit. Many little details show that a lot of thought and research was put into world building. While it\u2019s not quite on the speculative fiction level, it comes pretty close to being a D&D setting written as a real functioning world.\\n\\n\r\nA unique and fascinating main character and his character arc. The premise initially implies that Goblin Slayer is going to be a faceless killing machine. He was born to be a completely unremarkable average person, but then a single event radically changes his life making him fanatically focus on a single goal (of killing goblins) in favor of which he abandons everything else, including growing into a well-adjusted human being. But that doesn\u2019t mean he isn\u2019t a human being, or even that he is crazy. The foundations to lead a normal life are there, and the more Goblin Slayer comes in contact with other people, the more he grows, becoming more and more complex and constantly re-evaluating what he is.\\n\\n\r\nGood adaptation. Not slavish adaptation, but actually good adaptation. Things are swapped around and changed to accomodate episode length and season length limitations, thus having a proper story arc in 12-episodes format. Between the things that are the point of anime medium - fight scenes choreography, music, voice acting - the former two are great. And while the latter is nothing to write home about, hearing Priestess say Goburin Sureiya-san is a reason enough for an anime adaptation to exist. Also, main character\u2019s model is CGI and it looks fine unless you hate CGI on religious principle, not based on how it looks. For those who desire faithfulness, the anime is more faithful than the manga, which has an annoying manner of randomly changing characters\u2019 reactions/behavior, therefore changing the characters themselves and making them look inconsistently written.\\n\\n\r\n9/10 because this series succeeds in what it tries to achieve with basically no issues.\\n",

            "content": "[Breaking News: Man Literally too Angry to Die]\r\n[Alternative Title \u2013 Goblin Slayer Threat Level at Maximum]\r\nThey are rage, brutal, without mercy. But you. You will be worse. Rip and tear, until it is done. \r\n- Intro Dialogue to Doom (2016)\r\nHaving watched Goblin Slayer in its entirety, I can\u2019t help, but be reminded of the video game Doom (2016). In fact, the quote above perfectly encapsulates what Goblin Slayer is really about. Killing, slicing, dicing, burning, piercing, bludgeoning, ripping, and tearing goblins apart. The violence is brutal and extremely gory. Our main protagonist, Goblin Slayer, will use any means necessary to kill as many goblins aspossible. During the first episode, he kills by himself, while keeping count, exactly 22 goblins. That\u2019s a lotta damage. And also a lotta dead goblins. But, to our main protagonist any dead goblin is a good goblin.\\n\\n\r\nGoblin Slayer is also a very controversial series. It goes without saying that violence and gory isn\u2019t what made this series so controversial rather it\u2019s \\n\r\nthe sexual content and rape. Within the same first episode, we have the gang-raping of a female adventurer and the molestation of another one. Future episodes contain implied rape and torture of many female adventurers. And while the series could have minimized these elements, I believe it adds to the setting and enemy characters, i.e., the world is dark and brutal, and goblins do terrible things to female characters.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, if you\u2019re like me, who only watches to see Goblin Slayer kick ass, then you\u2019re not going to be disappointed. In fact, I would argue that watching Goblin Slayer kick ass alone makes this series really entertaining and worth watching. Everything else be damned.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY:\\n\\n\r\nGoblin Slayer is a dark fantasy based on the light novel and manga of the same name. The series sticks to its source material and doesn\u2019t remove any of its ultra-violence and sexual content. It should be noted that this series is not a isekai, where the main character is transported to another world and does whatever shit the main character needs to do. There are no fun adventures in this series, just death and destruction. Mainly the death of many goblins and other creatures, and occasionally some adventurers. But, that\u2019s just the general setting of this world, i.e., it\u2019s dark, cruel, and merciless.\\n\\n\r\nIf I had to simplify the story, it would mainly be about Goblin Slayer\u2019s \u201cadventures\u201d, how one man elects to do only goblin quests, in order to satisfy his anger and thirst for revenge. And, of course, based on his adventures you can expect numerous goblins to be killed in the most brutal ways possible. In fact, he would go as far as kill goblin children because to him \u201cthe only good goblins are the ones who never come out of their stinking holes\u201d, which unfortunately the goblins never do, so he has to kill them all. And I have to hand it to him to stick to his principles: to kill every single goblin in the world.\\n\\n\r\nNow, one may notice that some episodes feature \u2018slice of life\u201d moments, such as Goblin Slayer repairing his equipment, interacting with other adventurers, participating in shopping, checking his surroundings on the farm, etc. These moments are pretty boring, but it does add to the setting and provides some characterization for our main character. Furthermore, there are plenty of scenes where episodes focus on different characters along with their actions, fanservice from the main female characters, and jokes and laughs. However, in Goblin Slayer fashion, our main character doesn\u2019t care about other adventurers beyond his own friends, he doesn\u2019t care about the fanservice from his female companions and friends, and he doesn\u2019t care to have a sense of humor. The only thing he cares about is knowing where the goblins are and killing them.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\\n\r\nOur main character, Goblin Slayer, does what his name implies. He slays goblins, and nothing else but goblins. His reasons for killing goblins and only goblins originated from a tragic event that occurred in his childhood, i.e., the death of his older sister, and the destruction of his village. These two awful events changed him and, on that day, he swore vengeance against every goblin in the world. It\u2019s this vengeance that allows him to keep on living, in fact, even in situation where he should have died, he gets back up, and continues to kill as many goblins as possible. He\u2019s literally to angry to die. I have to admire his dedication and devotion to killing these goblins, even when he\u2019s about to die.\\n\\n\r\nAnd because, Goblin Slayer is our main character, he gets a lot of screen time and thus get some character development, e.g., he changes and becomes friends with other adventurers, he works with other adventurers as oppose to working sole, and we learn about his reasons for vengeance. Our other companions, mainly High Elf Archer, Priestess, Dwarf Shaman, and Lizard Priest, don\u2019t really have much background information and their personalities are somewhat the same, i.e., they are all kind, caring, and concerned towards Goblin Slayer; they are much more cheerful and happier than Goblin Slayer; and their appearance and job description are implied in their name.\\n\\n\r\nSome tidbits that I like about Goblin Slayer include: 1) he speak little to no words, mainly sticking to phrases like, \u201cI see\u201d, \u201cthat\u2019s right\u201d, \u201cyes, that\u2019s right\u201d, and is that right?\u201d; 2) he\u2019s not swayed by woman and their advances even when he\u2019s seen them nude, and finally 3) his eye become bright red indicating he is angry and filled with rage, this happens quite frequently.\\n\\n\r\nART/ANIMATION/SOUND:\\n\\n\r\nGoblin Slayer\u2019s art and animations are hit-and-miss. On one hand, they feature outstanding battle scenes with fasting-moving animations, such as sword-swings, arrows flying though the air, people rolling and dodging attacks, and, of course, brutal executions and various attacks. They also feature a great setting, e.g., dark and narrow caves, wide and spacious fields, and dimly-lit caverns, thus creating an effective atmosphere and ambiance. However, there is the obvious and overused CGI Slayer that somewhat clashes with the cartoonish-look of other characters, especially the female adventurers. I guess the creators deliberately did this to make Goblin Slayer standout, but more importantly to make him appear like a badass. Which, in that case, I could forgive because every time he starts fighting and kicking ass, he does look badass. Another noticeable feature is the number of close-up shots of the female character\u2019s pink and glossy lips, I guess the creators did this to show that the females have wits and charm, or just to make them appear sexier in front of Goblin Slayer.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound design is also pretty good. The background music does an excellent job of providing the right mood for the right moments. such as heavy badass music before and during fight scenes. The opening song is dark and eerie which is perfect for a dark and brutal setting. The voice actors and actress do a great job at making the characters feel alive, especially our main character who, thankful, doesn\u2019t sound too \u201cdark and edgy\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\\n\r\nHaving read Goblin Slayer, the manga version, I already knew what I was getting into, in fact, I was looking forward to watching this series. And did it disappoint? Not really. Goblin Slayer stuck to its source material. It doesn\u2019t shy away from implying rape and torture scenes, and the numerous \u2018glory kills\u2019 only reinforce the dark and brutal setting. I\u2019ll admit the story and characters are somewhat simple and straightforward, especially the characters, however its entertainment value lies within this simplicity.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I mean is this: Goblin Slayer, our protagonist, kicks ass and kills goblins, anytime and anywhere. That\u2019s it. And for me that\u2019s what makes it so enjoyable, watching this \u2018madman\u2019 or \u2018crazy bastard\u2019 kill a bunch of goblins in the most brutal manner possible has never been so entertaining. As, for the story, it\u2019s basically a depiction of Goblin Slayer\u2019s \u201cadventures\u201d. A vehicle that showcases what Goblin Slayer does to the goblins. And we all know what he does to them. And this alone makes this series worth watching.",

He is an empty tin-can, both literally and figuratively.\r\nHe is always wearing full body armor which covers his face and body at all times. This might look bad-ass in a character with \r\nless screen-time. But when the main character is wearing armor doing mundane things, like eating though though his metal visor, \r\nit really makes him look retarded.\r\nOne might overlook the superficial appearance of MC if he was givensomething resembling a personality.\\n\r\nHe is obsessed with killing goblins because TRAGIC BACKSTORY.\\n\r\nBoo-Fu*king Hoo\\n\\n\\n\r\nHis responses are monotone, like a robot.\\n\r\n99% of his responses are\\n\r\n \"Is that so?\"\\n\r\n \" Fine..\"\\n\r\n \"I See..\"\\n\r\n \" Where are the goblins?\"\\n\\n\r\nThese repetitive responses, combined with his appearance really get on your nerves over time. You don't care about him at all.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe Main girl character has turned 15 and she really wants to be an adventurer. That's her motivation & \"personality\".\\n\\n\r\nSupporting cast is your generic tropes in an adventure anime. Most of them are there to talk about Goblin Slayer, to make up for his cinder block personality.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 1/10\\n\r\nStory is non existent until now. Just kill goblins thats all.\\n\r\nThe biggest flaw here is TONAL INCONSISTENCY\\n\r\nCharacters are non-serious, joking and bickering, sometimes, even during dangerous quests, followed by scenes of carnage, immediately followed by same jokes.\\n\\n\r\nIts almost like the things happening aren't real and have no effect on them.\\n\r\nThey look like Edgy teens running around in a Adventure game.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nART, ANIMATION & SOUND 6/10.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNOW LETS TALK ABOUT THE INFAMOUS SCENE * SPOILER FROM EPISODE 1*\\n\\n\r\nThere is a random girl adventurer that gets raped by goblins. She is immediately cast aside by the end of episode. \\n\r\nWhy not make her the main girl? She has a lot more reason to fight goblins and the motivation behind her actions would be self-evident.\\n\r\n And this would have made a dark action packed emotional drama with cathartic violence.\\n\r\nBut the show neither had the intellect nor the courage to actually deal with such an issue.\\n\r\nThat is why I would say the rape scene was unnecessary, exploitative and only there to seem edgy.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR:\\n\r\nA Human shaped Tin-can, a stupid girl, an elf, a dwarf and a lizard-man walk into a bar.\\n\r\nAll of them talk about how great the Tin-Can is.\\n\\n\r\nTin-Can says \"Where are the goblins?\"\\n\\n",

            "content": "\"Slice of life really just tends to write itself.\"\r\n- Gen Urobuchi \r\nThese were the words I found myself saying when watching this newest iyeshikai (=healing anime) by White Fox. After the dark and edgy filled last season where a nameless series contained a traumatizing hand-twist scenes, I was blessed with a series that values the comfy and cozy side of every day life. These type of 2pure4this world narratives may to be very well-written or plot heavy series in generally, but they offer something most other series can only dream of: beauty.\r\nOur story centers around the daily life of a man who we simply referas the Goblin Slayer. His favorite past time includes slaying goblins, hence the name. Just like in many other healing centric series, Goblin Slayer himself is a very likable and strong person who essentially is offering the viewers a certain feeling of \"safety\" and \"comfort\" and overall a welcoming atmosphere that could be compared to the safe-space level of ASMR videos. This feeling is presented so well and in such a powerful manner that even other characters are feeling the healing and safety effect of Goblin Slayer by simply being close to him. This is the type of stuff that relieves my stress and gives me hope for better tomorrow, and also works as the main motivator for character development seen in the series. The character development for other character, I mean, as Goblin Slayer himself is already flawless.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest difference between Goblin Slayer and typical comfy stuff are the existence of \"villains\" in the series, who are -of course- essential part of the series, after all, how can man slay goblins if there are none? The \"green little shits\" side of this story is where the real good stuff is at. Essentially, these characters are what us humans would be if we didn't have someone as awesome by our side as Goblin Slayer. The acts of goblins are something us modern humans couldn't even comprehend. They do not follow such human-made concepts as moral compass or right or wrong. However, this is not to be mixed with one-dimensional characterization. Oh, no. What we, once again are seeing here, is what us humans would be if we didn't limit ourselves with self-invented moral codes. When the first goblin incident occurred, I didn't see any evil doing, but the natural act of uncensored person who is enjoying the good things life. These including the intimate acts inspired by our natural need to reproduce.\\n\\n\r\nThis might raise the question: what else exactly happens in the series? And that's the smartest decision that was made here: Absolutely nothing. That's right. The entire series is about slaying goblins and unwilling acts of mating. As a person who appreciates the simple things in life, the content where quantity is not prioritized but the quality of it -- anti-jack of all trades, master of none -- I truly appreciate what Goblin Slayer does with its overall story. It doesn't extend its art forms: it masters them. To get back to my original \"this is beauty\" claim, Andre Gide, a famous French writer and poet, has been rewarded for the quote \"Only those things are beautiful that were inspired by madness and written for a reason.\" And I find myself thinking these words whenever a goblin gets its head smashed in or the distant screams of unwilling sexual intercourse are echoing in the walls of any dungeon. This is what the rough, natural reality of life is all about, and life is ugly yet beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in the series is completely flawless because the scenes where goblins are slayered are great and the rapey scenes are also neat and nothing else happens. Therefore, no flaws. In all honesty, the art is the best part of the series and the single biggest upscaling from the manga. The highest maturity level, the cold and brutal atmosphere, the feel of a dark fantasy series and overall the badass characterization all have been changed to match what this series truly is about. For one, the color pallet is just ridiculously happy bright rainbows and unicorns -tier stuff that really brings alive the aesthetics and the all-positive look on things, serving the series and making it soothing to watch. \\n\\n\r\nSounds-wise, only smart decisions have been made. Whenever the characters mention Goblin Slayer, I find myself repeating out loud after them \"Gobulin Shleiyaa\". The foot-step sounds alone are already creating an awe-inspiring feel as this is the most badass walking sequence since the reappearance of The Mountain. I unplugged my bass, but the water surface on my glass was still making waves like in Jurassic Park. This is the type of stuff I like. The OST is also uplifting when it has to be and beyond calming and has a real home-feel to it especially in the tavern scenes and the sexual intercourse scenes.  Every part serves to warm its viewer's heart.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the content may occasionally be \"dark\" the series itself is radiating positivity and spirit, showing us how amazing humans can be even in situations that are less amazing and not preferred. By humans, I mean the ideal humans -- such as Goblin Slayer. Seeing how the weaklings, baka-boats and other people in the series who do not know how the world really works -- all are getting what is coming to them, is nothing less than a form of honesty. Only the strong, smart and most fit survive, and while many will not like it, this is what the ideal world looks like. There is no way to rig this game, and that's precisely why this series has a powerful healing effect. Equality in its purest sense. After just 4 episodes, I already feel like my very soul has been cleansed from everything that is evil, from all the injustice and acts in our very own world that make no sense and should not be. These things never occur in Goblin Slayer because it is a genuine work written based to how the world works and not how society wants it to work. 10/10",

            "content": "Goblin Slayer is an anime about a dude named Goblin Slayer who slays goblins. \r\nNow here's the part of my review where I wish I could say \"but there's just so much more to Goblin Slayer than that!\" Unfortunately, I just can't. In fact, with the exception of a few dark scenes, this show possesses all of the qualities of a typical fantasy world anime. Now is this a bad thing? Of course not. It's just that Goblin Slayer was hyped as a new and innovative approach to the genre. Yet from what I've seen so far, this simply isn't the case. In this preview,I'll list the two most prominent aspects of this anime that make it absolutely plain and generic.\\n\\n\r\n1. A lackluster plot that doesn't go anywhere.\\n\\n\r\nAt this point of a show, one would expect the story to have actually, you know, PROGRESSED in some way. Not Goblin Slayer. Other fantasy anime that many would probably classify as \"standard\" like DanMachi had already established some plot elements like character motivation and world building by this point. Yet in Goblin Slayer, what do we know? Well, there's a run of the mill guild that serves as the location for literally every relevant conversation and character interaction in the show...Okay, what else? Umm, apparently the demon lord is threatening the world, but no one seems to care too much...Wow, that's TOTALLY original...Oh, and goblins raid villages, pillaging and raping everything they see. Hmm, how...innovative? Seriously though, we know absolutely NOTHING about the world of Goblin Slayer. There's just a lot of much needed depth that's simply missing from this anime. All I've gotten out of this show is that goblins are bad and must be slayed. And to be honest, that's quite disappointing. \\n\\n\r\n2. One note characters with little to no depth.\\n\\n\r\nThe most prominent example is the protagonist Goblin Slayer. Anyone who has simply heard about this anime or read the source material knows that this man loves to kill goblins. Aaaaand that's it. So far, his personality hasn't developed at all. In fact, it's a stretch to say that he even has a personality. I'll give you a basic example of why his fixation on goblins can be detrimental to the already weak narrative. \\n\\n\r\nElf, Dwarf, and Lizard: \"Hey bro, we heard that u r supah cool fighta & want you to help us kill da demon lard.\"\\n\\n\r\nGoblin Slayer: \"Did you say goblins?\"\\n\\n\r\nElf: \"wtf\"\\n\\n\r\nYeah, that's basically how the meeting between these characters went down. Well, at least Goblin Slayer's given a good reason for hating goblins. And he looks cool when he's not animated in hideous cgi, so that has to count for something, right?\\n\\n\r\nSo while I was composing this preview, I realized that I didn't know the name of any other character in the show. Then it dawned on me that none of them actually have NAMES. They're just given titles like \"Priestess\" and \"Cow Girl.\" I mean what the hell? If that doesn't completely detract from any connection to the characters that a viewer might have, than I don't know what does. Well, I guess I might as well talk about some of them. Priestess is a cute, innocent girl who follows Goblin Slayer because...she can. Cow Girl is Goblin Slayer's childhood friend who clearly loves him and dotes on him but gets completely shafted by Goblin Slayer's fixation on goblins. Dem feels doe. High Elf Archer is obviously best girl cause she's a hot tsundere elf girl who gets drunk easily. Oh yeah, there are also some dudes in this show, but nobody really cares about them, so...moving on!\\n\\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, I have no problems with the cast. I even hope that the anime gives them much needed development down the line. But for now, there's just nothing that noteworthy about any of them. They're just, well, average.\\n\\n\r\nOn a positive note, the anime has decent technical aspects, but nothing outstanding. The opening theme is a pretty good song. It's a captivating combination of both modern and classical music that perfectly coincides with the tone of the anime. The seiyuu do a fine job and perform their roles adequately enough. The visuals are pretty standard, and I have no problems with the animation besides the choppy and unrefined cgi. \\n\\n\r\nSo I've established that Goblin Slayer is basically average in every sense of the word. But there has to be something special about it, or else it wouldn't receive so much attention. So what does Goblin Slayer have that makes it stand out from the rest of the crowd? Extreme Edgyness! \\n\\n\r\nThough in all seriousness, it's not nearly as edgy as people make it out to be.\\n\\n\r\nI simply couldn't end this review without discussing what made Goblin Slayer so popular (or maybe \"infamous\" is a more suitable word). Yes, this anime has rape and gore, which is heavily demonstrated in the first episode. Thankfully, it's not used to the extreme in every episode, which would, for me, be quite detrimental to the anime. Instead, it's used as a means to show that fantasy worlds aren't all fun and games, and that they contain a lot of pain and misery too. Makes you think twice about wanting to live in a fantasy world full of monsters even if you get all of dem waifus, doesn't it? \\n\\n\r\nThat's right, I'm actually defending the dark scenes in this show because they do, in fact, add layers to this anime (albeit pretty thin layers). I betcha thought that I was a butthurt snowflake who would complain about the rape scene after seeing my score for this show. But it was I, Di- *ahem* Anyway, like I wrote in this review, Goblin Slayer's flaws lie elsewhere.\\n\\n\r\nYou know, if the anime continues down the path it's going, but starts to include some good plot progression and character development, then I think it could actually be at least a semi-decent and entertaining anime. But for now, it's just lacking too much to be anything but mediocre and generic, which is really unfortunate.",

            "content": "\u201cAnyone who likes/dislikes this show is a Nazi/Libtard.\u201d \u2013 The state of the anime community after episode 1.\r\nI think it is fair to say that no other anime has caused such controversy and overwhelming divide amongst anime fans after a single episode like Goblin Slayer has. The pilot almost effortlessly setting a spark across the community that would act as ignition to countless flame wars lasting for weeks on end. A scene lasting around fifteen seconds receiving more vitriol and condemnation than arguably every other anime airing this year. On the surface, the divide seems clear: on one side lies those vocal to their displeasureof even the sheer existence of this series, labelling it as edgy, repugnant and pornographic. Some going even so far as comparing the anime to Nazi propaganda decades ago. And on the opposing side lies the fandom, constantly upset by criticism their beloved show receives and reverting to insults and name-calling them with popular phrases such as the dreaded \u201cSJW\u201d for example. But these are simply gross generalisations of both the series and its viewers, centring upon a small group of outspoken individuals that unfortunately leads any attempt of discourse astray. Instead my aim here is to hopefully bring a more critical view on Goblin Slayer to the discussion; of the series\u2019 perceived intent, as well as numerous faults and issues prevalent throughout its first season.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cThe gods of light, order and fate, and the gods of darkness, chaos and coincidence decided to throw dice in order to determine which side would rule the world. The gods threw the dice over and over and over again, until they began to feel faint.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nGoblin Slayer is a dark fantasy anime adapted from both the manga and light novels of the same name, highly inspired by tabletop role-playing games. Initially the story follows a young woman known as \u201cPriestess\u201d that has recently become an adventurer and joins an upstart party on her first quest. Their naivety and inexperience ultimately lead to their grim demise, ravaged by goblins who commit heinous acts such as rape and dismemberment depicted in much more graphic fashion compared to other fantasy anime of recent years. Before the Priestess can be dispatched however, the actual protagonist appears from the shadows, intent of massacring every goblin in sight. From this point, the series is predominantly focused on this mysterious adventurer commonly referred to as \u201cGoblin Slayer\u201d and his efforts to exterminate the entire goblin species.\\n\\n\r\nThe beginning to this story gives what I believe to be a clear sense of what Goblin Slayer strives to be. Simplistic, cheerful dialogue to elucidate fundamentals of the adventurer system, a light-hearted tone able to create a strong optimistic mood, even the visuals and audio utilizing light colours for character designs coupled with an upbeat tune all try and convey a presentation akin to the typical fantasy anime of recent memory. The group of upstart adventurers each can be seen representing archetypes one would expect to be present in such a series: tsundere, loli character, main character for a harem, etc. Numerous times before a goblin appears on screen, subtle signs are revealed about the party\u2019s lack of preparation and expectation to indicate this quest will not be as successful as they hope, and then what follows is a shocking realization of what the world of Goblin Slayer truly entails. Essentially these characters were tools for the series to subvert people\u2019s initial expectations of the story, with the tragic events that entail further emphasizing this point. The sickening portrayal and detail of these actions going to further lengths than most anime fans have probably ever experienced previously in the medium. Disgusting to watch even for the short time shown, and from the reception this anime received, it looks to have garnered the initial reaction staff had intended. From this perspective, while many can find these scenes crass and tactless in their depiction, I find it difficult to call this part of Goblin Slayer lazy writing.\\n\\n\r\nShortly followed by the introduction of the titular protagonist reveals a change that strongly contrast to events that just transpired earlier. Compared to the almost wilfully ignorant upstart adventurers that end up decimated to the lowest mob type in the world, Goblin Slayer\u2019s approach to killing goblins is much more tactical. Shown to analyse nearly every time he murders a single goblin, often determining the most effective method for slaughtering the mob step-by-step before executing his strategy in cold, calculated fashion. Through this he not only personifies the kind of badass main character one would expect for a darker fantasy story, but also provides a solid understanding of how a high-level adventurer would be expected to act in battle. Armed with various weapons and antidotes whilst always on the lookout for signs, Goblin Slayer has enough tools at his disposal to face any goblin he would come across. A clear juxtaposition to how many inexperienced adventurers would conduct themselves. Him slaughtering the horde also raises an intriguing question of Goblin Slayer\u2019s morality when intending to murder the child goblins. While the protagonist remains steadfast of his opinion on the species, the Priestess brings forth the possibility of a \u201cgood goblin\u201d. Despite going through with eliminating them, he does admit there could be one out there. From this, viewers have a grasp on how this tale could further develop this idea with having both character\u2019s ethics challenged as Goblin Slayer\u2019s quest continues. There is potential in this tale to be more than just the fun schlock of the season. Unfortunately, that potential slowly gets squandered every episode following, and personally even loses the series\u2019 initial appeal.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the more detrimental choices I find a story can make is following an attempt to create a purposeful, serious tone, and then reverting to what it tried to distance itself from initially. After Goblin Slayer\u2019s shocking start that firmly established the story as a dark fantasy that supposedly takes itself seriously, the anime takes an odd change in tone that is rather baffling to understand. Numerous quests later in the series showcase characters in a way you would never have expected in Goblin Slayer, with an array of playful, trifling scenes one would more commonly associate with a slice-of-life anime than this show. Somehow the series decided to skip on possibly showing some of the effects trauma experienced from death, sexual assault or even just being an adventure can have on a person, instead these scenes barely contribute to the characters on a notable level. The change in tone can lead to breaks in one\u2019s immersion of the story and the protagonist it follows, with transitions feeling awkward and out of place more often than not. A notorious example can be found in episode 2 where the episode cuts to a well-endowed redhead girl waking out of bed and stretching, followed by some of the most prominent jiggle physics to be found this season. I thought this was meant to be a serious tale. For a dark fantasy to work, usually it requires the atmosphere of a series to remain constant enough to a degree where the earnestness and consequences of actions can still be felt through the more cheerful scenes. Berserk, Attack on Titan and Fullmetal Alchemist 2003 are just some examples of dark fantasy anime that constantly have a sombre air about them, constantly felt when witnessing the actions of their characters. Goblin Slayer lacks this air that breezes alongside the narrative and whilst continuing to lack a strong sense of identity in a genre already spoiled by an abundance of generic fantasy, it is more inclined to leave a stale taste in the mouths of those hoping for Goblin Slayer to distance itself further from its contemporaries.\\n\\n\r\nThis lack of an identity also permeates the narrative and overarching worldbuilding to a degree that I have to address. When a series attempts to be a subversion or even a deconstruction of a genre, normally this would involve acknowledging tropes typically associated with a genre whilst subverting their intentions. Goblin Slayer, at least in its first season, does not do this. Alongside the series constantly switching the tone between dark and nonchalant, the anime seems to never want to take its world very seriously despite the premise. Goblin Slayer is a man who has an unrelenting obsession to kill goblins as they are a species that lingers on as a problem for innocent people. They are weak creature with childlike intelligence individually, but as a mob are a destructive force which can lead to the devastation of entire towns. An interesting yet believable problem in this world. So then, how is it believable to think that there is only one person that acts in response to this problem? Because the anime has mainly taken place around a small town there is a possibility for other adventurers similar to Goblin Slayer to be primarily hunting goblins in their own areas of the world. But thinking on a large scale, if goblin mobs can and already have been a significant cause of wiping out various towns, would someone not think that their effect to agriculture and the overall economy poses a severe threat on a national scale, to where even adventurers seeking glory and fame would end up losing money? I would have at least expected some form of intervention \u2013 here is an idea: have some adventurers hired as a form of security for farmers against a potential goblin attack. Or at least have the guild girl not allow novices to take these jobs when it is made apparent how many novices and kidnapped and killed off by goblin mobs! If so many are dying because of this fact, maybe it would be best to intervene, even if with just a simple warning about how dangerous they are, and how prevalent this is. If only Goblin Slayer had more consistency in its world that more people could admire, instead of trying to subvert common fantasy anime tropes and then as if almost contradictory to itself maintaining a level of unbelievability behind how these aspects work in its story.\\n\\n\r\nIt is upsetting how a show essentially fails at fleshing out the more complex issues the world of Goblin Slayer encompasses, especially when most of the defence for this anime in regards to certain actions and events is derived from insular logic. A common complaint for the series initially was based around why goblins rape, and while it certainly is specified that rape is their only option for reproduction, that does not cover details about their creation. Goblins here are force-of-nature villains that embody evil and chaos, thus not requiring distinct personalities and from this the rape shown can be considered a further way of emphasizing that point thus bringing them to where they can be considered irredeemable, but this only works on a narrative level. All works of fiction are made with intentions from their creator/s and by peeling down the layers of in-universe context is one able to search for the purpose and intentions behind specific scenes, actions, etc. Often termed the Thermian Argument, it claims that pointing to a show\u2019s logic in response to criticism of the subject matter is inherently fallacious. It supports a difference between what is being depicted and why such is being depicted at all; a metanarrative point of view. I stated what I believed to be the main intention behind such shocking acts in the first episode as a way for the show to subvert the audience for what kind of anime they were in store for, but after witnessing the series make that idea almost completely irrelevant through poor direction, tonal dissonance and having such actions repeated onscreen later with similarly crude framing for reasons even I am unsure of, it is hard to defend the series for all these creative choices happening numerous times throughout the anime\u2019s duration from a metanarrative point of view.\\n\\n\r\nCharacterization is one of Goblin Slayer\u2019s focal points if even only applying to one individual so far. Goblin Slayer is the embodiment of a man who refuses to die before his purpose in life is seen through to the end. Driven by revenge after goblins took away the person most precious to him, he epitomizes the idea of how a badass protagonist should act. His character design is also impressive in certain scenes with a red eye theme glowing in the darkness that oozes a killer instinct rarely found in anime nowadays. Reminder that the in-universe creation of the series was founded on gods rolling dice and playing the game of chance, with all various races and species being birthed purely for their amusement. But with the way Goblin Slayer acts, he can be considered the one character in this world to defy the will and wishes of those who created him. And while there are numerous examples of him conveniently surviving so far due to plot armour, the intent remains \u2013 underneath his monotonous voice and implied social awkwardness lies the potential for a metaphorical figure of inspiration. Unfortunately, that is where most of the praise for characters ends at this point in the anime. Every character besides Goblin Slayer receives little attention in the anime, with minimal development bar the Priestess who acts as a rookie slowly growing and learning how to survive as an adventurer in this harsh world, however even this has made little progress this first season. Other characters sprinkled across the story range from other rookies slowly improving and gaining experience to dependable fighters often able to hold their own in battle, which is a striking difference compared to how most typically act away from any battlefield; childish and immature. Honestly, besides Priestess and Goblin Slayer the rest of the cast are easily expendable, but I guess that is to be expected when the supporting cast includes names such as \u201cCow Girl\u201d and \u201cLizardman\u201d. Hopefully if there is a sequel, they have a better opportunity to leave a lasting impression on the anime.\\n\\n\r\nMuch like these forgettable characters the production quality for Goblin Slayer also failed to leave a strong impact. The art is not very detailed, with most character designs and backgrounds often appearing plain and generic for most of the season. A mixture of 2D and 3D animation is used to jarring effect, with most action scenes and the occasional panning shot relying on CGI that look more like an eyesore that anything visually pleasing. In fact, most of the better-looking shots involve scenes lacking any sort of movement. Disappointing as the artwork is commonly seen as a key strength to the manga\u2019s popularity. For a series where the most basic appeal comes from a guy mowing down goblins, the action was underwhelming and that kills a show like this. Wish I could say otherwise for the soundtrack, but that also failed to leave a strong impression on me. Voice acting was solid but effectively crippled with a lacklustre script treating half the characters as dense. The opening theme was melancholic but failed to ever have me personally want to listen to it more than once. The ending theme while I certainly enjoyed it more was accompanied by CGI Goblin Slayer with clunky animation. At least the ending track was fun.\\n\\n\r\nGoblin Slayer is at its core, an anime about one man slaying goblins. Though it can tempt viewers with ideas of something greater at work, it still boils down to a mere schlocky action show with lacklustre presentation that by the end of its first season has its biggest strengths stemming from potential and a hope that a sequel can further flesh out characters and worldbuilding which at this point cannot hold up to scrutiny. But it does have its appealing qualities no matter how superficial they might be. If you are willing to take a chance on a simple action anime trying to break the trend of generic fantasy released this year, this might be worth your investment. My main hope is that now with the most controversial anime of the year finished, the community at large can learn from this experience. As the old saying goes: \u201cThat which does not kill us makes us stronger.\u201d\\n",

            "content": "I'm at a loss for words.\r\nNot because of the show's quite questionable and more than broken quality, which I and many others, have been pointing our fingers at since the first episode made its appearance, but rather something... much more bizarre. I find it astonishing how much controversy and heated exchanges a single scene has sparked up among the viewers, even though its importance, in the grand scheme of things, is as insignificant as one can be.\r\nAnd I will never understand how and why a mind-numbing phenomenon of this calibre came into existence, but I digress.\r\nGoblin Slayer is not a fundamentally weak story, and Iwant to get it out of the way from the get-go. Sure, it is a notably straightforward one, but a work's extreme simplicity should never, under no circumstances, be considered a bad thing. Frankly, if executed correctly, the anime would be a silly yet moderately delightful experience, I would be willing to even revisit at a certain point in the future. That did not happen though as too many components of this now deformed cake came out as undercooked.\\n\\n\r\nThe logic in Goblin Slayer is one of my favourites. Goblins are established as a level one mob, a being with intelligence and strength of a child, which are not worth wasting your time on. Adventurers are reluctant to pick up quests revolving around the little bastards for that reason alone; they will not grant you glory and an excessive amount of gold. That is understandable yet odd at the same time. We learn that goblins, with time, can mutate and become a stronger version of themselves, champions, shamans etc. And no one seems to care about it! Does the government or the military exist? We never hear about the monstrous demons and different abnormalities making their moves in our world since the Demon Lord-esque being has been defeated, which would be the priority, so these fellas don't have their hands full. Goblins can, literally, ruin economy at its very core, destroying villages, crops, kidnapping women and killing farmers, yet, people overlook it and do not see it as a glaring and alarming problem. Maybe they are waiting for hordes of goblins knocking at their door to remind them of this? Or perhaps they are waiting for the guild to send inadequately qualified rookies to certain death and young girls to help goblins reproduce, like the insensitive degenerates they are?  Who knows; I for one do not. \\n\\n\r\nI do not understand the idea behind implementing a \"moral dilemma\" as well. In episode one, after the Goblin Slayer had slaughtered a group of his favourite pesky green creatures, he found a hole with a few baby gobs hiding inside it. Naturally, he decided to help them meet their end, but for a reason still foreign to me, Priestess, with a face covered in tears, tried to prevent him from doing that by saying \"what if there are good goblins?\". Here is the problem with this sentence; no one should raise such a question. Goblins use women, murder and destroy on a daily basis, and everyone, even newbies know about it, considering the Priestess admitted that such things often take place in the world. They are inherently evil beings, who hate \"those with words\" and we are witnessing this very image of them, remarkably black and white monsters with one goal in mind, on every instant throughout the show, making the concept of a good goblin even less probable, to the point of impossibility. Though we can merely bat an eye on this odd situation, the limitations Elf Archer put on the Goblin Slayer are not that easy to ignore. The implementation of the \"No water, fire or gas.\" rule was a logical decision during the sewer mission as using any of these methods could potentially cause collateral damage, but other than that, I fail to understand its presence in the story. Goblins are horrendous, so why should they not be treated like filth, which someone has to eliminate from the face of the earth no matter the methods used? Why should they not be killed in nonhumanitarian ways? I cannot wrap my head around this one. Of course, I might be just a picky bastard for mentioning those, but this attempt at bringing a little bit of \"depth\" to the story bothers me a lot. It looks as if the series desires you to take it more seriously, but, in my eyes, both the morals and Sword Maiden's horrific PTSD cripple the experience rather than enhancing it.\\n\\n\r\nThese pretty irritating problems with the narrative could have been easily avoided or at the very least reduced in intensity if the characters had not been cardboard cutouts. It upsets me to no end that the supporting cast is so fixated on the titular character that their goals and ideas seem not to exist at all. In reality, we know nothing about these folks; absolutely nothing. Their names are that of the classes or roles they represent since the author is not good at coming up with names, we have no idea why they accompany him, and their backstories are nonexistent just like their personalities. Honestly, I could describe the characters one by one using three words at max. Even the Goblin Slayer, the \"person\" who has got the most amount of screentime and development in the entire story, fits the bill perfectly. Despite not having any social skills, redeeming qualities as a person and, overall, being a monotonous walking trash bin with his only quirk being his tragic past, girls flock to him as if he were the most handsome chad they have ever seen, creating a harem full of carboards head over heels with him. You either become a part of the collection or are a nameless component of the background, whose entire existence boils down to making fun of the titular character merely to do a 360 and convert into one of his newly found buddies. \\n\\n\r\nFor a show with such brutal content, it sure as hell does not restrain itself from exhibiting blatant, in your face fanservice. I'm not against seeing a tit or two, but I believe that displaying an extremely sexualised \"morning routine\" right at the start of episode 2, which is the polar opposite of the travesty we witnessed a week earlier, is not the most brilliant idea ever. Same goes for the character of Sword Maiden, whose sole reason to exist is being a fanservice dispenser, shoving her pair everywhere it is possible with an extremely horny attitude and the camera pointing at her immense cleavage whenever it can. Even though we ought to look at her heroic records of a gold ranked adventurer as an impressive feat, her inadequately handled, if communicated at all, PTSD, instead of doing the character favour, made the Sword-Maiden a damsel in distress relying on the Goblin Slayer to save her from the monsters who used her when she was younger. The fact that a mental disorder was utilised for mere wish fulfilment is sickening.\\n\\n\r\nThe show does not know what it seeks to be. Its tone is, to put it plainly, all over the place. Like blood and corpses, the slice of life moments filled with characterless struggles at comedy and the previously mentioned plethora of tasteless fanservice scenes are regular guests on the screen. In one instance, the cast is having fun, bantering with each other, enjoying food or other activities, and in the next scene, there are blood and gore everywhere. Heck, even moments which are supposed to invoke emotions are immediately squashed by booby shots. Complete tonal dissonance achieved. Viewers disengaged. \\n\\n\r\nI wish I could compliment Goblin Slayer a little bit for its overall visuals, but, in all fairness, there is nothing worth praising here. While the art style has that generic oomph to it and does not ooze with any striking manner or personality, for the most part, it looks okay-ish. I cannot deny that; the designs seem decent, and some of the backgrounds are not half-bad. Nothing worth being called good, yet not offensive either. However, the constant, jarring CGI, presumably used to put off the viewers and make them feel as uncomfortable as it is humanly possible, completely ruined one aspect the show had going for it, its appearance. I could count on the fingers of two hands the number of scenes where the Goblin Slayer is not 3D while walking or making other movements. I understand the creators' intent, they did not want to draw his somewhat intricate armour piece thus save some time, but the final result of this overuse of CGI is nothing short of saddening and immersion breaking for its quality is utter rubbish.\\n\\n\r\nIt gets even worse when we have the opportunity to observe a fight scene because, oh boy, the animation in these is something out of this world. I have seen my fair share of battles so dull, linear, poorly thought out and animated that make your insides scream in agony and here, most of the encounters suit this category of a sort quite well. The tension is never present since, in the back of our minds, there is always that certainty that the red, glowing eye of the edge will prevail by the end of the day; his script reading skills come in handy all the time. Furthermore, every single fight tastes the same, with the door to creativity forcibly sealed because of the abnormally dumb and absurd morals enforced on the cast, which prefers to stick to a handful of spells, occasionally whipping out a new one for the oh-so-fantastic surprise to forgetting about the restrictions and winning without much stress and hardships with distinctive tactics. \\n\\n\r\nSigh, I wanted to enjoy the show for what it is, but Goblin Slayer is like a patchwork of the worst kind. It tried to be a jack of all trades, yet ultimately became a master of none; implemented a myriad of different elements only to watch them painfully fall flat on their faces. Attempting \"depth\" which added nothing of substance, having more than an apparent identity crisis, while maintaining the unintentional hilariousness at its highest level; this utterly devoid of motion and emotion series fueled by controversy and tears of soy will soon perish into the unimportance as, in spite of its position of the hottest show of Autumn 2018 and le epic meme generator, it will hopefully soon be forgotten. \\n\\n\r\nAnd the thought makes me happy.",

            "content": "Goblin Slayer is a show that abducted my wife and sold off my children into slavery. It is the reason I stay awake at night with visions of tiny green blurs bouncing on the edges of my bed. Undoubtedly, Goblin Slayer is singlehandedly the worst thing that has ever happened to me. I used to be an avid cave enthusiast with a PHD in cave science, but now I can't step one foot into a cave without my feet turning cold (and not due to the naturally decreasing temperature, either). I see them everywhere; in my dreams, in visions. Faint glimpses while walking down thestreet.  Menacing silhouettes in the distance. Moreover and especially whenever I'm eating peas. \\n\\n\r\nI finished my services in Nam back in early '75 and from then onwards assumed I wouldn't be put through anything similar again. Being violently thrust into the jungles of Saigon suddenly seemed all too inconsequential upon bearing witness to the first 10 minutes of Goblin Slayer. I have been scarred for life. Following these events, I have purchased a suit of chainmail armor and a few water scrolls from Ebay to protect myself from the inevitable and despite my therapist's best wishes. The end is neigh, my friends.\\n\\n\r\nJoking, this anime is bad lol. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to realize the sole reason it's currently in-season for one reason and for one reason only. Shock factor, but more specifically the rApE. Goblin Slayer is a substanceless heap of hot garbage, albeit hot garbage packed meticulously well. It serves as a constant reminder that the people who forfeit artistic integrity, and maybe even their pride - oftentimes have it the very best. Liking shock factor fueled shows isn't a small niche, granted, but not to this extent where everyone cares for them, and the people who don't typically know to avoid them. Yet for some reason once sexual assault gets thrown into the equation, everyone and their grandmothers rush to the scene. And only then too is it that people get upset and start storming the shed looking for pitchforks. \\n\\n\r\nDepiction of rape in art can either be tasteless or serve a purpose. In our case and in the humble beginnings of Goblin Slayer its initial intentions are presumably to villainize the goblins. Rape is probably the single easiest way to make the audience dislike the perpetrator. And low and behold, it works... for a while. Not before long, it devolves into nonsensical softcore porn, but more importantly manages to desensitize a large portion of the viewerbase to the act itself by repeatedly shoving it down our throats. Which has me convinced the word \"villainization\" is thrown around as nothing more than a convenient scapegoat here. If it truly were about muh villainizing, it did a damn shitty job by instead making me profusely grin at a child's sister unwillingly partaking in a goblin bukkake in front of his very eyes. \\n\\n\r\nIt's an actual fear of mine that some 12 year old somewhere on this very planet popped his first boner over a few goblin cummies. And what a massive one it must have certainly been. While it's clearly overused mainly just to maintain cheap interest for the story, the point to take away is that no one should have their goblin slaying experience sullied by implementation of needless hentai elements. If animated goblins really are your kink, HentaiHaven probably has you cov -- Oh, wait. :(\\n\\n\r\nBefore getting into the nitty gritty, litty titty, or the plot if you'd rather, it might be important to address the whirlpool of opinions surrounding the anime as a whole beforehand. Some conflicting, others in fullhearted agreeance, it doesn't really matter. The root of the problem is the sheer amount of opinions, instead. Please refrain from adding this anime to your stagnant PTW with 200+ and counting titles that you'll never get around to finishing in this lifetime or any other after seeing one scene and a Gigguk video on it. The most enjoyment someone can suck out of this withered goblin's crusty nutsack is watching a grown man get a stroke over episode one. Head on over to EtikaWorldNetwork for more information. \\n\\n\r\nYet youtubers, discussions, and the community as a whole have deemed it fit to blow a staggeringly boring show out of interstellar proportions. All because of a little edge. Consider realistically, what else does Goblin Slayer bring to the table? Cookie cutter characters, a nameless and faceless protagonist who is the literal living embodiment of stoicism itself and a Tolkein-esque animified high fantasy setting with that rudimentary boring ass guild system that's making me want to rip out my nose hairs by the second.  Konosuba you aight tho.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is, as the title suggests, a well over four hour journey of pure unadulterated goblin slaying and all the misadventures accompanied along with it (18+). Resembling a few anime due to the aforementioned setting, there are two I constantly see being referenced as similar, with Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash definitely being the most prominent one. These two shows clearly split at birth, and one is a bit less retarded than the other but it's still clear to see why the mother abandoned both. I have an entire review dedicated to Grimgar written two years ago, and seeing as I'm writing this right now you'd figure shoving special ed kids in lockers to be a specialty of mine. Berserk's the other one often mentioned, which almost seems like another gateway for Berserk fans to toot their own horn for liking the grimmest, darkest comic of them all. \"This series people like has rape? My series also has rape, but, like, betterer\". \\n\\n\r\nI'd like to say the show has a definitive highlight (i.e plot, characters), but it's about as consistent as Miura's writing. The quality of the fight scenes is incredibly varied, ranging anywhere from terribly unengaging to kinda fun and the SOL scenes inbetween are either boring as all hell or funny-ish. The humor in these scenes typically relies on showcasing how much of a flat out sociopath our protagonist is. It typically follows the structure of one of the side characters interacting with him in a normal way and him responding like a lizard person. Or like if Gendo Ikari had his own show and wasn't a neglectful father but instead the protagonist of an action adventure. Essentially, he's just Jotaro minus Star Platinum. While that means he'd probably still make a better Jojo than Jonathan, Jotaro has the power of unfunny memes and Jojokes on his side while this guy swims around in sewers killing goblins. Talk about luck of the draw. \\n\\n\r\nHis backstory is pretty unclear and at one point in the show he is even killed, only to be resurrected back to life by laying in a bed with a virgin. Disregarding the Kirito-tier plot armor for just a second, if that method of resurrection were applicable in real life I'm pretty sure the anime community would account for the single most renowned group of healers in the realm. Last but not least, his suit of CGI armor is incredibly ugly looking and has almost become synonymous with his character by now.  The epic character of.. the nameless titular character almost makes up for the fact that using more than a single adjective to describe the entire cast is overkill. The most characterization this lot gets is establishing a tropey elf vs dwarf rivalry and a personal favorite of mine, that is seeing the dragon-lizard-man's transformation into a certified cheese connoisseur\\n\\n\r\nAnyway there's really not much else to comment on. The main sauce of this whole Goblin Slayer saga lies in the fact that something so bland has gotten so tremendously popular and even well-received overseas. I call it a saga because judging by its level of success, it'd be dumb not to continue in this season's footsteeps. But I suggest instead of how power scaling exists in shonen, every season they up the ante by doubling on the number of goblin gangbangs.",

            "content": "The fall 18 is a pretty interesting season for anime. It was the season that gave us the nicely written romcom anime Bunny Girl but at the same time, it gave us the ulmate train-wreck of 2018 that was Tokyo Ghoul re where that season completely shat itself for a living. It was also the season that gave us the very underrated Release The Spyce, the epic and fun continuation Golden Kamuy second cour and the lovely sweet Bloom Into You. However all out all the anime from the Fall 18 there was one show that totally shocked the anime community when it first airedand that anime was Goblin Slayer. When the show first aired it gained a lot of controversy as it contained a lot of rape scenes that shocked the anime community. The first episode was so shocking Crunchyroll themselves had to change the rating from PG13 to R17+. Despite that, the first episode of Goblin Slayer didn't bother me all that much as I already knew by an advance that the series would have a lot of shock values thanks to people's reactions and unfortunately that is where Goblin Slayer starts to fall apart quickly because this is not a good series at all. If you remove the rape scenes, you're just left with a lifeless husk of a fantasy anime that fails to impresses the viewer outside its dark content. \\n\\n\r\nSo What went wrong with Goblin Slayer?\\n\\n\r\nWhat caused this show to be so bad where it becomes one of the worst animes of 2018. You will soon find out.\\n\\n\r\nStory.\\n\r\nThe story follows an inexperienced priest named Onna who joins a party of inexperienced adventurers where they take part in the first quest in a cave. However, the party first adventure doesn't go as well as apart from Onna the party ended getting attacked, killed and raped by Goblins. When all hope was lost she is saved by a man known as Goblin Slayer, an adventurer whose only purpose is the eradication of goblins with extreme prejudice. From there Goblin Slayer and Onna adventures of killing Goblins begin.\\n\\n\r\nBecause I think everything about the story is horrendous, I will be spiting the story section into small parts starting with the first episode.\\n\\n\r\nThis is the worst first episode I seen for 2018 as a whole. Outside of the cringe-inducing over the rape scenes the episode is poorly directed mess that is filled plot contrivances. For starters, the Guild lady is such a pushover because instead of being this strict but helpful builder she is a brain dead idiot who lets a bunch of first timers go ahead with the dangerous adventure without a veteran member of the guild. This is incompetent writing at it completely goes against nature and appeal of the fantasy genre that has a rank/level system. How would you like it if there was no one stopping you from going into caves that contained high-level monsters that can one-shot newbies? That defiantly wouldn't be fair as the newbie would have a big disadvantage from the beginning. The whole point of having a rank system is to not only identify players ranks but to also the people who have an edge in terms of battle experience. On top of all that we don't see the new adventurers even get prepared at all as stuff like testing out gear, magic, training by fight low-level creatures and even stocking potions/revival herbs are non-existent at all. There's a difference of being realistic and being downright incompetent there is no way in hell that an inexperienced group would do a quest without even getting prepare for it.\\n\r\nThis is almost as stupid as fighting the giant in Skyrim at level 1 carrying weak battle gear with no potions.\\n\\n\r\nKeep this in mind this is just the first episode. The series somehow manages to get even worse as time goes one as show literally betrays itself as a dark fantasy as where it decides to become the laziest and unoriginal light-hearted fantasy harem anime I have ever seen in my life. Many fantasy story elements from Goblin Slayer were done so much in other fantasy anime and some of the episodes feel like boring filler content. The tone shifts were out of control at various points, the pacing is below average and the writing itself is straight out incompetent. My favourite example of this incompetent writing happens in episode 7. After Oona pees herself off out of pure fear Giant goblin grabs her. Instead of biting her head off the goblin decided to bite a small part of her arm causing her to scream very loudly. This contrivance causes Goblin Slayer to get a random berserk power where despite him bleeding a lot in the progress he makes to take various goblins in his way until they eventually run away.\\n\\n\r\nAll of this is due to Goblin Slayer having writing comparable to bad fanfictions done by 12-year-olds and I'm sure that one of that the same 12-year-old writer who wrote Akame Ga Kill also wrote this.\\n\\n\r\nBefore I talk about the worst thing about Goblin Slayer let's talk about this show pathetic excuse of worldbuilding. The worldbuilding is Goblin Slayer is absolutely abysmal because not only does the series goes a horrendous job at establishing its own world but the people into the universe have absolutely no regard of the people are living in it. Some of the examples include how the group of adventures don't seem to have a reaction to the wagon that is filled with traumatised women who have been raped by goblins. Another example of how people in this universe don't seem to care about the goblin race as they all say that Goblin is weak creatures even though they have been capable of killing and raping people including experience adventurers.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nAs for the world establishment in Goblin Slayer itself, it's pretty awful. The lack of establishing monster races other than Goblins, blacksmith, inns, the name of the country that the series is set and I could go and go. The worldbuilding in Goblin Slayer it makes the worldbuilding in Akame Ga Kill and Re:Zero (White Fox other fantasy show) look competent by comparison.\\n\\n\r\nNow if you thought the worldbuilding is dogshit, the series direction is somehow even worse.\\n\\n\r\nIn my Tokyo Ghoul re: review, I mentioned that it was the worst directed series I have ever seen. Goblin Slayer made me seriously question what it really was. For me to answer this question is yes. Tokyo Ghoul re: was direction ultimately way worse but the direction in this series is still a complete abomination to a point where it makes the series direction for Darling in the Franxx and The Asterisk War look like a masterpiece by comparison.\\n\\n\r\nYou may think that I'm just skipping the character selection together to talk about the shows visuals but trust me this shows direction is so utterly horrendous I literally had to start talking about the show technical aspects.\\n\\n\r\nSome of the examples of the show abysmal directing happen in the first episode where get a bunch of disjointed shots off our adventures fighting the goblins. It was not pleasing to see thanks to abysmal camerawork and framing and it only made the scenes look more pathetic than actual fear.\\n\\n\r\nAnother good example happens in episode 11 where the character model of Goblin Slayer keeps changing to bad CGI model to 2D model. What had me facepalming hard was when he talked about the hoard of Goblins planning to attack the outskirts of the town the character model of Goblin Slayer kept on changing even when he isn't moving at all as he was just standing still.\\n\\n\r\nThe best example of this show disgusting direction happens at the end of episode 7. Normally in anime when an episode ends, a show would have nice transitions to the end credits. While not all shows are perfect of transitioning to the end credits it still does a good job of telling the audience visually that the episode of set series has finished. So what does Golbin Slayer episode 7 do you may ask? \\n\r\nWell instead of closing the episode like every other anime the series decides to have looped a still image with an eye-opening and closing for two minutes. TWO MINUTES!!! This decision boggled my mind so much that I thought I would intensely drop dead on the floor. How did anyone in Japan greenlight this broken directed fuckfeast of an episode?\\n\\n\r\nThe most infuriating part about all this that the dub version still kept that looped still shot. Could the production in this show be any more incompetent? Did someone in the editing room simply forget to do a transition to end credits? I'm sorry but this was simply unacceptable. I honestly cannot believe that this shit was a thing. Also, we don't speak about the recap episode of Goblin Slayer as it was just a horrendously compilation of poorly edited clips of the series that we already have seen before.\\n\r\nHow pathetic!!!\\n\r\nOverall the story of Goblin Slayer is a complete abomination.\\n\r\n0/10\\n\\n\r\nChararters.\\n\r\nThe characters Golbin Slayer are awful and I was being dead serious when I said that. They all just a bunch of uninspired one-dimensional shitheads.\\n\\n\r\nGoblin Slayer is one of the worst written characters in 2018. Not only he's an unlikable and unrelatable to the eye but he only has a single character trait that he just wants to kill Goblins for the rest of his life. I understand the series tried to make him as this stoic badass character but didn't work thanks to terrible writing. In many ways, he's no different to the typical silent protagonist that you will see in Video Games.\\n\\n\r\nOnna is not much better, in fact. She is even worst then Goblin Slayer as she is a just a plan useless girl from start to finish. There's nothing else to say about this useless husk of a chararter who just incompetent with her role and pissing herself whenever she gets scared.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters in Goblin Slayer are nothing but the bottom of the barrel collection of fantasy characters tropes.\\n\\n\r\nOld drunken fart (Dwarf Shaman)\\n\r\nGeneric fantasy girl (High Elf Archer) \\n\r\nTits girl (Cow Girl) \\n\r\nBootleg Guts (Heavy Swordsman)\\n\\n\r\nI could go on and one talking about how lifeless these characters are I won't because since this show doesn't care about making these characters interesting so why should I bother. They are just a bunch of empty husks that exists in this lifeless husk of a fantasy show that prioritizes pandering to a certain audience being the edgy 12-year-olds over actually telling a story that has a purpose.\\n\r\nScrew this!!!\\n\r\n1/10\\n\\n\r\nVisuals.\\n\r\nGoblin Slayer visually look liked they been lobotomized. There is not a single frame of decent art here let alone okay animation. Now I think about it this show seriously looks like it was fished out of a toilet. Some of the visuals in Goblin Slayer looked bad in 2002. The characters designs in Goblin Slayer uninspired as they all looked they throw away concept art for set fantasy anime. The same thing can apply for the background scenery.\\n\r\nThe fight choreography ranged subpar to awful as many of the battles outside the rape scenes don't seem to have any impact or weight to it as the animation is stiff and terribly animated. Let's not forget the shows horrendous use of CGI for the Goblins and Goblin Slayer armor. \\n\r\n2/10\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack has about much effort about put to it as the characters and visuals. The tracks are all uninspired fantasy that you all heard before. Many of the tracks sound like bad ripoffs from Overlord, Akame ga Kill and Berserk. Not they are generic but they sounded generically bad. The same thing can apply for the opening and ending themes.\\n\\n\r\nNow for sub vs dub.\\n\\n\r\nThe sub was okay for what it was as all the Seiyuus did an alright job with the roles that they were giving. So I have no complaints whatsoever with the sub.\\n\\n\r\nThe dub for Goblin Slayer is absolutely awful in every way possible. I seriously don't know what the hell was Funimation was thinking when they decided to dub the because it sounds like ass. The worst dub is Goblin Slayer himself as the actor who voiced him sounded like he was holding a tin can walkie-talkie.\\n\r\nHorrendous dub stick with the sub.\\n\r\n2/10\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts.\\n\r\nGoblin Slayer is a disgrace of a fantasy anime. It tried to this epic fantasy anime that contained a lot of blood and rape but it ultimately falls completely flat its face thanks to horsehit series directing, empty characters, horrendous worldbuilding that puts Akame ga Kill to shame and shit shock value writing. Studio White Fox may be a shit studio when it comes it fantasy anime but after watching Goblin Slayer it made me realise that they are not capable of making/adaptation fantasy anime as the studio would pander to the lowest common denominator rather than make a story that is worth telling.\\n\r\nYou're better off watching Berserk and Slayers rather than watching this bottom of the barrel fantasy anime that toys around the viewer mindset with its stupid fanservice and awful shock value. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Score 1/10\\n\r\nNow if you excuse me, I will be slaying Goblins in Dragons Dogma Dark Arisen.",

            "content": "This is a spoiler free review.\r\nGoblin Slayer is the one of the better series this season and probably the most popular anime this season. The show has an interesting concept, dark themes and it has decent comedy elements. It also has a interesting main character that hates goblins. Unfortunately, the show has a very controversial first episode that made a lot of viewers hate the show because of one scene.\r\n1. The controversy\r\nFor those who haven\u2019t followed the Goblin Slayer controversy. Right after the first episode this show has received tons of backlashes due to its rape scene. There have been a huge disturbance and conflictingdebates among the anime community. Many people were disgusted towards Goblin Slayer due to what it showed in the first episode. Some people got so triggered that they deemed the anime as trash and said that this anime promotes rape. Yes this anime has rape in it, so what?\\n\\n\r\nThe rape scene in Goblin Slayer is just an element in a dark-fantasy anime. The rape scene may not be necessary, but it does have purpose of describing a realistic fantasy world where dangers and stakes are real. A lot of other anime have rape scenes like SAO and Berserk, but why can't Goblin Slayer have a rape scene? The controversy of Goblin Slayer is just bullshit.\\n\\n\r\n2. Story 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe series is set in a generic fantasy world. The show is a deconstruction of the typical fantasy tropes by taking a new spin on the known character and world archetypesl. The story (and the OP) does allude to the fact that the world and the characters may be just a part of a game played by gods. Relationships between each of the characters are given enough time to develop and feel natural. This series has also some pretty good comedy elements.\\n\\n\r\n3. Art and animation 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is good and the fight scenes are also animated really good, but the series has a lot of stil frames and Goblin Slayer is a lot of the time in CG. The art and animation is overall good enough.\\n\\n\r\n4. Sound 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI liked the OP and ED a lot and the voice acting was decent, but I didn't like the voice acter of Goblin Slayer.\\n\\n\r\n5. Characters 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe first few episodes had not a lot of character development and we didn't know a lot about Goblin Slayer and the Priestess. However, by episode nine we got more background on Goblin Slayer. In general, both he and the Priestess are excellent characters. The other party members are also great, especially the elf, I loved her interactions with the Dwarf and Goblin Slayer a lot. Regardless of the pace of development, the characters are driving this anime more than anything else. They are all an interesting and entertaining bunch. It is hard not to like them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe show is great and I can wholeheartedly recommend it to all but the youngest anime fans. Even if You decide it\u2019s not for You, do so after watching three or four episodes instead of just the first one.\\n",

            "content": "Goblin Slayer makes me upset.\r\nNot because of its content, mind you.  But because THIS is what the community decided to make a whole brouhaha for, rassling endlessly about how \u201cDAE RAPE IS BAD???\u201d\r\nNow, I apologize, we\u2019ll talk about the show itself in a hot minute or two.  But the community discussion of Goblin Slayer really is integral to the series itself.  Like an album cycle from Kanye West, public reaction is all part of the seasonal anime paradigm, after all.  Even if this anime is lost to the weight of time (read: four months), it should be noted that this animecaused quite the stir for its first few weeks of airtime, until everyone finally realized that SSSS.Gridman and Zombieland Saga were the actually worthwhile shows. \\n\\n\r\nIt was hilarious.\\n\\n\r\nApparently, no one\u2019s seen Berserk.  Devilman: Crybaby wasn\u2019t a thing.  But this little ditty had an ape beginning with the letter \u2018r\u2019, so the community became a monkey house about it.  Many parts praising the anime, with a loudmouthed bunch absolutely horrified over it, causing the latter half to be even more vocal.  And that\u2019s why, at the time of this writing, Goblin Slayer is the most popular anime of Fall 2018, ahead of the new Sword Art Online, and the much more beloved adventures of Slimeboi and Bunny Girl.  Nevermind the fact that, two seasons ago, Mahou Shoujo Site literally did everything in its own first episode that Goblin Slayer did, plus change, and was outright buried by the community for it, the general seasonal community doesn\u2019t like to dwell on things too much.  Not that I\u2019m implying anything~\\n\\n\r\nAll this, for what?  Is Goblin Slayer REALLY that daring of a show?  Is it showing a brutal, grimdark reality?  Is it making a scathing social commentary?!  Is there an intellectual masterpiece lying underneath all of this terror?!?!\\n\\n\r\nHa ha ha!\\n\\n\r\nNo.  Like the Elf\u2019s chest, the answer is a flat, uninspiring no.\\n\\n\r\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I love Goblin Slayer a lot.  I think this show is a blast to watch.  But I don\u2019t consider this anything more than what I mentioned earlier.  \u201cCheap entertainment.\u201d  It\u2019s not gonna mentally challenge you, unless you\u2019re a literal retard.  In fact, as far as graphic violence goes, I\u2019d say there isn\u2019t really enough to recommend the anime based on that single element.  It\u2019s there and it\u2019s nice, but it\u2019s something that\u2019s lurking around the corner, rather than a relentless bombardment.\\n\\n\r\nBut, it\u2019s true.  Goblin Slayer--the character--has no personality.  The goblins themselves act as a mindless force who do bad things so the audience will root for their defeat.  The supporting cast is gimmicky; the setting, mild; the story, basic; and an artstyle uninspired. \\n\\n\r\nAnd to what end?  Well, the thing about Goblin Slayer is that it never really tries to offer a fully immersive adventure series.  The show doesn\u2019t ask you to think.  It doesn\u2019t ask to be questioned.  As dumb as it is, Goblin Slayer is exactly what the label says.  It\u2019s about Goblin Slayer.  His name is Goblin Slayer.  His occupation is being a Goblin Slayer.  \\n\\n\r\nWhat Goblin Slayer--the show--does, is strip everything down to its very basic elements and present something simple and blunt, and that\u2019s what makes it a hilariously amusing show.  Goblin Slayer--the character--this is getting out of hand--has a brutal honesty and charisma more dull than his armor.  See, this guy is not just A goblin slayer--he is THE Goblin Slayer, and the lengths of which his dedication go to are quite fascinating, and, honestly, really goddamn funny.  His entire brain is geared to destroy every goblin on the face of the Earth.  He constantly wears his armor \u201cjust in case\u201d, he only ever accepts quests that involve killing goblins, and he even mutters \u201cGoburin\u2026\u201d every now and then when he\u2019s about to embark on a quest.  It\u2019s like Ash Ketchum on the Genocide Route; it\u2019s a simple, childhood-like dream that\u2019s continued into adolescence and consumed everything about you.  He\u2019s a man on a goddamn mission.\\n\\n\r\nAnd when I say this anime is funny, I don\u2019t just mean \u201cha ha, graphic violence, what a spectacle!\u201d like I normally do.  Although, that is pretty funny tbh.  But I truly, genuinely think that Goblin Slayer presents itself as a comedic show many times throughout its run.  With things like Goblin Slayer\u2019s--goddammit it, this is hard to express--MC-kun\u2019s blunt personality will create some funny back-and-forths with the characters he regularly parties with later into the show. \\n\\n\r\n\u201cWhat is that?\u201d says the Elf, gazing upon the birdcage which this Undyne-looking motherfucker is holding.\\n\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know what a bird is?\u201d he replies.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s that Sheldon Cooper, possibly autistic mentality that makes him enjoyable.  His inability to properly communicate with other people lead him to say things so sharply honest that it has a witty sensation, and as you\u2019d expect, it has an effect on the people he interacts with.  In a scene where Goblin Slayer\u2019s party--he forms a party, by the way--gives their own noble speeches about why they became adventurers and what it means to them, they circle around to Goblin Slayer, who begins to say the usual \u201cto slay Goblins\u201d, he gets cut-off mid-sentence by the Elf, essentially saying \u201cyeah, we fucking know.\u201d  And that one scene with the Sword Maiden. . . do I even need to explain why that\u2019s funny?\\n\\n\r\nAnd when I say--shit I already said that. Oh well.\\n\\n\r\nAnd when I say this anime is stripped down to its basics, that\u2019s not me being reductive.  That\u2019s not a 0IQ comment of \u201clol turn ur brain of cuz its dum!!1\u201d, I really mean that it\u2019s basic.  Every character in the show has a name that is exactly what they are.  The priestess is called Priestess.  The elf is called Elf.  The hot receptionist waifu is Guild Girl.  The girl with big titties is Cow Girl.  The setting has room for full exploration, but chooses to focus on this one little story instead.  You know the template isekai plotline of \u201cI\u2019m the main character and I need to defeat the Demon King God Emperor Overlord!!\u201d Well, that happens in the world of Goblin Slayer.  The big boss is actually defeated.  Not by the Goblin Slayer himself, mind you, but by a completely unrelated character known as The Hero.  Imagine that.  The world has more areas to explore.  Adventuring is a given; ranks are awarded to those who succeed, and many other characters do as such.  But, among all that, this anime is about one thing and one thing only: a guy who just really likes to kill goblins.\\n\\n\r\nI commend this story for sticking to such basics.  Say what you will about it, but it doesn\u2019t ever stray off its path.  It\u2019s delivered just as advertised, no refunds allowed.  If you want a more expansive fantasy, that\u2019s fine.  But Goblin Slayer never, ever promised to deliver that, and it really doesn\u2019t have to.  Not every fantasy needs to have the long, thorough exploration of One Piece.  Not every conflict has to have the moral greyness of Shinsekai yori.  If you don\u2019t like that, well, you should probably just watch another show instead of bitching about this one.  It din\u2019du nuffin\u2019.\\n\\n\r\nFor what it\u2019s worth, Gobby Gobby Kill-Time has a surprisingly believable world.  Mr. Slayer isn\u2019t a character who is worshipped and respected.  He\u2019s not a self-insert made to look badass.  He\u2019s a fucking weirdo and is treated as such.  Other adventurers look down on him, gossiping about his disgusting habits: not ever cleaning his armor, never talking to anyone and only taking the most redundant of quests despite his Silver ranking being quite high up the board.  His job is not admirable.  \\n\\n\r\nDespite that, there are people who believe in him.  There\u2019s his cow-titted sister or what the fuck ever who appreciates his work.  Priestess was initially saved by him, and follows him around to not only learn various things as an adventurer, but to also normalize him as a person.  Elf and the others--actually, I forgot why they\u2019re there.  Oops.  And then the receptionist waifu commends him for his dedication in one of the anime\u2019s most underrated moments, where she expresses her appreciation for doing the things he does.  Because, at the end of the day, it\u2019s a job that needs to be done, even if it sucks, even if no one wants to do it, something that many people can likely relate to.  \\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s no bullshit.  No real asspulls or crazy powers.  The anime has a good sense of rules, balance and logic for its battles.  Different weapons are used depending on the environment; magic has very limited usage, items are consumed in very specific circumstances with preservation in mind, and many different approaches are used to killing goblins.  Do they storm into a nest and rampage through them all, or do they lay traps and smoke them out?  How do they deal with an ambush, or a boss?  And better yet, what happens when shit really hits the fan?  This party isn\u2019t perfect, and there\u2019s a threat of very not good things constantly lurking.  While I wouldn\u2019t say Goblin Slayer has any real strokes of genius with its combat, it certainly gets the job done well enough to make it a believable and interesting enough action series.\\n\\n\r\nGoblin Slayer is a fun show.  It\u2019s as simple-minded as the title implies and plays the role it signed up for.  It\u2019s a very simple action/adventure series with an edgy streak to it, but please note that it\u2019s really not the edgiest thing in the world or even really this season like holy fuck watch Golden Kamuy you fucking cotton-humpers.  Anyway, at the end of the day, it might seem strange; I\u2019m giving this a positive review but also saying it\u2019s not that big of a deal.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s because it isn\u2019t.  Y\u2019all just need to calm down.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\r\nArt: 4/10\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nGoblins: Dead/10\\n\r\nOverall: 7.5/10 (Range: 6.0-8.0)\\n\\n\r\nThese are bonus sections because they don\u2019t really add anything to what I was saying, but some people might still care for some reason.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is mud.  Rapist Slayer Guy is CG in some scenes and not CG in others.  It doesn\u2019t look good when he is, and the fact that he isn\u2019t all the time makes it very weirdly inconsistent.  The director sometimes does good things, but also tries a little too hard to make some shots look cool; it\u2019s very hit-or miss.  There's also a countless number of horribly tacked-on blood splatters that makes every kill look hilarious.  The backgrounds are nothing to write home about and the setting itself is pretty generic, but the character designs are actually quite good.  Mr. Slayer has a cool red eye for when he gets cereal and Priestess-chan can get the dick; I\u2019d go as far as to say they look iconic for how strong their designs are.  Elf has some cool, sharp features and Lizardman looks pretty rad.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP has one of the most interesting songs that I\u2019ve heard in anime this year, to the point where White Fox seemed pretty clueless as to how to animate it.  Some of the shots feel very strangely timed and there\u2019s little consistency to its visual themes.  Still, the song alone makes it a great OP with its somber introduction going into mysterious vocal melodies, crescendoing into an action-packed verse until it lets out a long vocal stream, layered over another melody about wanting to kill goblins and shit.  It\u2019s actually really well-written, but the percussion sounds like someone farted on the audio waves somehow because it sounds like shit.  The ED sucks.\\n\\n\r\nWatch SSSS.Gridman.",

            "content": "Goblin Slayer is an anime that everyone can enjoy.\r\nFollowing a badass computer-generized protagonist slaying mobs of goblins like the pests they are, it encourages every person watching to take arms, get active and do something with your life. Our man got cucked in his backstory by a dozen goblins and now he doesn\u2019t give a flying f*** no more. Now he slays goblins and women on the daily. What other guy do you know in this show that got healed through taking a virgin\u2019s purity? I\u2019ll wait\u2026\r\nThe priestess first joins a group of no-hope losers with no understanding of what a potion is, and asexpected, they are beaten, bloodied and booted from the show, but the Priestess ends up saved by Lord Slayer-kun and just like real life attraction, the girl is taken for her hero and follows him everywhere. She would follow the MC to the ends of the Earth if only to prove her worth to him. Now that\u2019s something every man on the planet can learn from, instead of wasting hard earned money on false prophets like PrankInvasion teaching you how to kiss women on the streets by practicing on a pillow.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is subtly brilliant with depicting Lord Slayer-kun in a completely different animation style, further showing how much more advanced of a person he is compared to every other character in the show. The red eye symbol is kind of dumb as he has two eyes but I\u2019m being nitpicky here.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound, well I\u2019ll be honest, it sucks but you have the option to mute every episode so that renders this part of the review proof.\\n\r\nI\u2019m amazed how in a year that completely disappointed with trash after trash after trash after trash after trash, finally there is a show that can inspire everyone to be a better person. Maybe I\u2019m just optimistic, but everyone has at least the chance to watch how an alpha male goes about his business\\n\\n\r\n\u201cThe only good [losers] are the ones who never come out of their [mothers basement]\u201d\\n",

            "content": "It\u2019s safe to say that if it weren\u2019t for series such as \u201cConception\u201d and \u201cMy Sister, My Writer\u201d airing this Fall, then Goblin Slayer, without a shadow of a doubt, would take home the title of \u201cWorst Anime of the Season.\u201d It\u2019s an anime that yearns to be Berserk but fails miserably. An anime that sacrifices everything in service of a threadbare plot with zero long-term emotional impact, along with gratuitous fanservice and surface level vileness for vileness\u2019s sake. It's the classic case of trying to have its cake and eat it too, which is very telling in its premiere episode that caused one ofthe most controversial moments in recent time\u2014in order to vilify the enemies in this story and darken its tone from a seemingly happy-go-lucky JRPG world, it gave every excuse possible to use rape as a shock factor to hook viewers in\u2014It\u2019s actually woven into every fabric of the story that it is literally impossible to avoid talking about rape when discussing Goblin Slayer. \\n\\n\r\nThe writing is beyond abysmal that there are numerous contradictions in its worldbuilding that is so glaring that it cannot be ignored. In addition to this, every character is one-dimensional and so generic to the point of being incapable of having a moment of introspection, having personal goals that don\u2019t revolve around the main protagonist, and they have no names since the author states in an interview that he is bad with them. So, the characters are referred to, as their character classes since this fantasy is set up like a tabletop RPG. Being the cardboard cut-outs that they are, almost the entirety of their dialogue consists of only talking about the main hero of the story and his goblin quests, his name is\u2014get this\u2014Goblin Slayer (will refer to him as GS). He\u2019s a stoic man, barely says a sentence, hardly ever takes his armour and helmet off, and is your typical Marty-Stu who overcomes the impossible, and has a harem of anime beauties that love him for the shallowest of reasons. His only defining characteristic is his edgy glowing red eye.\\n\\n\r\nNot only does the audience have to suffer through these plastic characters but also the villains are alike, which are the goblins. These creatures represent the evil of the world and their purpose is to simply destroy and multiply. This is where the story and worldbuilding reach the lowest depths of terrible writing. The goblins are underestimated in this world and acknowledged as a non-priority, despite these inworld facts: The first being that goblins are weak and a low threat; they have the size, strength and intelligence of human children. The second being, goblins are well known to be dangerous; they massacre, rape and pillage, some can even cast deadly spells. If goblins are so weak and stupid that a normal villager is capable of killing one, then how can they do everything in the second inworld fact? Why does the show continue to preach how goblins are level 1 mob but also tell us how history and current time teaches about the notoriety of the goblins? It is later explained that goblins can evolve into higher classes if they live long enough where they will gain experience, learn to organize. This contradicts the first inworld fact\u2014let's say for argument's sake, it\u2019s an unreliable piece of information, then how is it possible for the population to believe something so contradictory to the fact of the world?\\n\\n\r\nGoblins have an immediate impact on the citizens as well as its economics. A villager gets pushed aside despite begging the guild and government for adventurer and military aid to defend their hamlets and farms from hordes of goblins, but since this incoherent story makes them out to be a small issue, he gets ignored. The adventurers wouldn\u2019t do it for free either since they are all assholes who only do things for money and glory. It makes you question the common sense, ethics and morality of this world. Especially when the villagers are responsible for the farming\u2014crops and livestock, mining, crafting and architecture. If you remove GS from the story, it collapses straight away since he is the only person who takes these quests besides rookies, who basically end up dead as mention by the guild. Why are they underestimated when the majority of new adventurers, who take on goblin quests, die? How can the world remain this na\u00efve when this occurrence is frequent and goblin attacks are so abundant? It literally makes zero sense. With GS out of the picture, all the goblin nests shown in the story, multiply to insane numbers, the goblins will gain experience and evolve, led by more Goblin Lords and will pillage all the hamlets and farms, raped numerous women and eventually take over the main towns.\\n\\n\r\nI don't get the reasoning made for goblins to rape. Yes, I understand in the story that they have to use females from other races to procreate since they are all born males, but that's the Thermian Fallacy! I'm asking specifically the logic behind this from a meta point of view. The author made them beings of pure evil to cause chaos and pain but gives them the glaring oversight of needing other race's females to reproduce. And from a serious narrative point of view, this only serves as a way to make goblins seem bad, e.g. \u201cGoblins are bad, rape is bad, so goblins rape!\u201d This is the main logic behind the reasoning given. It was a way to depict the goblins as spawns of evil and to establish that this is a dark and cruel world. The issue here is that having the goblins suddenly raping women is really unnecessary to achieve that goal, the story acts as if murder or torture is incapable of doing so. An obvious sign that values being dark and shocking over telling a story. The way they use rape is to make this show artificially darker for no reason other than being edgy - and that is what rape essentially is in Goblin Slayer, cheap shock value! \\n\\n\r\nIt is very rare for any fiction to be able to use rape to darken the tone of its world without turning that work into smut. If dark elements like rape could be removed and the story would be exactly the same, then those elements shouldn\u2019t be here, to begin with. Relying on artificially added darkness only makes Goblin Slayer's story a piece of trash, far from mature and smart. Especially when these dark elements are selectively applied to everyone outside of GS bubble of happy-go-lucky JRPG world with his harem of anime beauties, which none of them gets raped during the current storyline. While everyone else is living in the goblin rape house game. At least Berserk has enough inworld consistency to subject important characters to the carnage. No, I'm not saying that equally raping everyone makes a better story but there is no consistency in the world of Goblin Slayer. In Berserk, rape is a reality that everyone may encounter. It is a clear message that the characters are squarely operating within the world's rules. It is not done frivolously either because the events did not put them out of the picture like some used goods. They become survivors and turned it into a narrative of strength and recovery, adding to their characters depth. They are trying to not let the act define them forever. And this is exactly where Goblin Slayer shamefully stumbles on, it\u2019s an embarrassment to the fantasy genre and the anime fandom.\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned previously, the world is set up like a tabletop RPG. The \u201cgods\u201d created this world from the bottom up, made the laws and rules, designed and created everything. Every piece on the board represents a character. The gods did this out of boredom, they play the game similar to the likes of D&D where they roll the dice to determine the fates of the people of this world. For some odd reason, GS is the only piece on the board that is able to negate their dice roll on him, effectively ignoring the laws and logic despite rolling a nat 1 himself. GS is a powerhouse walking Deus ex Machina while also being the pinnacle of a Marty-Stu, a character who constantly peaks at the script to have all the essential knowledge and sources to overcome any obstacle in his path. Even in times when the story makes his plot armour as thin as possible, there is no tension. The one time where viewers felt that there would finally be consequences was resolved by off-screen healing magic which required GS to sleep with a naked, underage virgin (Deus ex Machina) without previously mentioning such a spell.\\n\\n\r\nIf there is one thing Goblin Slayer executed \u2018well\u2019 was the amount of unnecessary fanservice. Every woman in this story is some sexy bombshell with gigantic funbags or a breathing kawaii anime troupe. Studio White Fox ended up adapting Kumo Kagyuu and Noburu Kannatsuki\u2019s horrible manga and light novel. The animation was poor, a lot of recycled sequences, especially for GS and the goblins. Terrible use of CG on GS that reach the highest levels of cringe imaginable. Most of the blood and goblins themselves were CG. The character designs were unoriginal, basically ripping off characters from Fate Stay, Berserk and Sword Art Online. The score was weak, soundtracks cutting off abruptly during transitions and the seiyuus couldn\u2019t shine with the lacklustre script they had. There was even a recap after episode 10 which is very telling on how well White Fox really did, basically, they raise the white flag. Watching that recap would be recommended instead of viewing episodes 1-10 as you would not miss anything, and it would save you a lot of time.\\n\\n\r\nGoblin Slayer tries to make other factors feel important like legendary heroes, demons, dragons and all these things that are shown in snippets, much later in the series. When you see them, it honestly feels like you\u2019re watching a completely different anime. There is a huge disconnect here since the story spends its time delving into one man\u2019s struggle against this dreadful set of circumstances. Which means every other aspect of the show is a failure as it is not explored, they are not in service to the premise so they become nothing more than distractions\u2014yet another sign of bad writing. This show has more problems, such as cinema narrative dissonance; the story being told visually does not agree with the story being told by the script. A perfect example is when the show finally attempts to explore the psychological trauma and PTSD of a victim of rape, which was completely ignored for most of the story. While the Sword-Maiden is telling her experience, the shot composition is dedicated to her bouncing tits and stiff nips. It is titillating, with various camera angles and lingering shots. And it happens twice, the second time having her also trying to seduce GS as she was portrayed as one of the shows many whores. Doesn't it occur to anyone that the atmosphere, the scenery and the fanservice are undermining the actual tone of what it's trying to tell you as the audience? \\n\\n\r\nIn summary, Goblin Slayer is worse than a poor mans\u2019 Berserk, in fact, it shouldn\u2019t even be compared to it. It\u2019s a culmination of every poorly written fantasy rolled into one with high levels of exploitative sexual violence, used to shock the audience into thinking they are watching some mature and deep piece of media. The story (lack of it) and characters (who lack characterization) cannot hold together without GS. Remove him out of the picture and everything collapses. When you can imagine the cast of \u201cNo Game No Life\u201d doing the happy-go-lucky, slice-of-life elements that are in this show is when your suspension of disbelief has evaporated. It manages to insult your intelligence and also on a personal level with all its nonsensical gibberish. There is just no redeeming quality in this clusterfuck called Goblin Slayer, an abominable series whose legacy will be its controversial first episode, and won\u2019t be remembered by anything outside of it, which practically makes it a wet dream for edgelords.\\n",

            "content": "Goblin Slayer is one of the few anime which raised my hype from '0' to 'maximum'. Only Nozoki-Ana (ok there was only an OVA & a 130+ chapters manga) and  Yamada-kun to 7-nin no Majo managed (12 episodes anime + 2x30 min OVA & 240+ chapters manga) to do the same. Indeed, when I started watching GS, I immediatly switched to the manga (both original & prequel) right after latest episode finished airing. Time to read the Light novel now that I received my GS wall poster.\r\nTalking more seriously : Goblin Slayer first shows itself as a dark / violent / horrific anime (everyonewho watched episode 1 only would answer that). However, it quickly turns out to become softer, to please a bigger audience I guess. For anyone interested in a more cruel, darker & disgusting version of the story, you should take a look at the manga or the light novel : they might give you chills thinking about how bestial are the goblins. Not as dumb or weak as showed in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot isn't complicated and the major points of the anime are : its characters & its fights. Even though I have to add that you shouldn't expect a deep developpment of the characters... they don't even have names (people usually using words like High Elf Archer (HEA) or Anvil ; Priestest, GS, Guild Girl (GG), SpearMan (SM) etc... to design them). Nevertheless it won't impeach you to find a catch for them, considering they are more normal & close to you than you think, despite the environment, magic and universe. As I read, the author intended to not give names because he saw his creation as a game of Dungeon & Dragons, so every players (in our case, viewers) could incarnate any character.\\n\\n\r\nBasically, it was a beasts / monsters VS Humanity story, and you will take the second one's side for sure. The anime gives you a hatred towards those filthy creatures and makes you enjoying every new massacre ! Especially the last arc, that was critized at first because it shouldn't be taking place at the end but more like at the beginning. Anyway, it was a really nice idea to swap arcs, in order to provide the viewers an amazing ending. It also officially announces a second season, even if the manga content can't afford it... YET !\\n\\n\r\nFinally, a great show with a taste of violence in a darker universe. Definitely the one you should have watched during Fall 2018 if you like this genre. I placed it within my Top 3 favorite Fall 2018 anime, alongside with Zombieland Saga & SSSS.Gridman. I highly encourage everyone to watch the show then read the manga (if you are hardcore fan, even read the light novel !).",

At first I thought it would just be some gory and edgy anime about a guy who kills goblins (My assumption wasnt that far from what it is), but it turns out there is way more to it than just that!\r\nBefore watching the anime, I thought the story would just be something stupid and ridiculous, but it turns out there is a real motive to all of it. \r\nThere was quite a controvery with the first episode of Goblin Slayer,due to the amount of gore and especially that one rape scene. But this was indeed all necesarry to understand the situation thats going on. It aint all fun and games in a fantasy world.\\n\r\nAs a Manga reader, the story itself is really interesting and really enjoyable, but at the same time its pretty gory (Not on the level of \"Berserk\" though), so if you aint into gore or violence then this anime isnt for you.\\n\r\nI also love the art style, the only thing I dont like about it is the CG for the main character every now and then, but other than that, its all pretty cool. The soundtrack is also great! The OP is actually in English which is nice to see in animes everynow and then.\\n\r\nIn the end, I rate this anime a solid 9/10. Really enjoyable! Great story! Awesome characters! Go ahead and give it a watch, unless you aint into gore. <3",

            "content": "Overview:\r\n2018 was an odd year for anime. We started the year with sky high hopes for Yuasa helming a Devilman adaptation. That ended up just kind of meh and underwhelming on every level since the oil and water dynamic between Yuasa and Nagai just didn't work out.  \r\nWe FINALLY got a sequel to FLCL...and everyone hated it. We got a reboot of Galactic Heroes using pretty boy characters and CGI space battles, which is currrently rated like shit here on MAL. \r\nWe also saw a strong resurgence of shock value anime and edge starting in late 2017 and continuing into this year. Last year,we got the tasteless and utterly trash Inuyashiki and King's game. This year we got Magical Girl Site, Happy Sugar Life, and today's subject: Goblin Slayer.\\n\\n\r\nGoblin Slayer is in a way a perfect encapsulation of anime in 2018. From the bland characters to edgy writing to horrible CGI, what better series to symbolize what may be the worst anime year in decades?\\n\\n\r\nPlot:\\n\\n\r\nGoblin Slayer takes place in a world that operates similar to an MMORPG. Once you reach around 14 years old, you become an adventurer. You must go around slaying monsters and finding treasure in order to level up and achieve new ranks within society. Monster slaying quests are handled by the guild, who are fucking terrible at their jobs. The guild sends out poorly trained children to slay monsters they often aren't prepared for with no warnings or hesitation. Our deuteragonist is a young priestess whose entire party get brutally killed and raped by goblins in just the first episode. She and her party were essentially level 3 and the goblins are level 3-5 with some of the tougher ones around level 10. They had no chance from the beginning and the guild apparently knew this and didn't care. Oddly enough, the guild's criminal negligence and high mortality rate is never explored. Fortunately, she is saved by Silver Rank adventurer who is the equivalent of level 60 or so. This guy despite his high level has dedicated his entire life to killing every last goblin. Goblins killed and raped his family, so now he is the titular Goblin Slayer. It's like if Goku was so enraged that Saibamen killed Yamcha that he spent the rest of DBZ flying across the galaxy killing every last Saibaman! What a grand adventure!\\n\\n\r\nThe odd thing is that the Goblin Slayer is actually the sane one. While everyone else longs for grand adventures overseas slaying dragons and exotic demons, nobody is addressing the Goblin infestation at home. As a result, entire towns and cities are getting annihilated by goblins and the human population in the light novels is stated to be in decline while the goblin population is rising exponentially. Humanity is being threatened with extinction and only the Goblin Slayer cares! Everyone else seems perfectly happy with letting the Goblins rape and slaughter their families. If this were written in Trump's America, people would immediately suspect it's a heavyhanded allegory for immigration written by some far right jackass. That's not actually what Goblin Slayer is. Sadly, the answer is just as dumb. It never really explains this in the anime, but apparently the world of Goblin Slayer was created by a D&D campaign with the 4 \"Gods\" just being 4 neckbeards. The reason everyone besides the Goblin Slayer is a moron is that the Dungeon Master is far more competent than the 3 rookie players. However, they forgot about the character of the \"Goblin Slayer\" and that's why he still has free will while the strongest heroes are being controlled by the incompetent rookies. It's like a 6th grader trying to rip off something the comic writer Grant Morrison would do.\\n\\n\r\nThe tragic but hilarious thing is that Goblin Slayer didn't need to be this bad! It would have been mediocre but acceptable if it was just a 15 year old writing bad Berserk fanfiction. We all know the light novels exist SOLELY because the author was so enamored with with the troll arc in Berserk. Sadly, not every episode is like the first. Most of Goblin Slayer is actually bad humor, bad fanservice that doesn't even show tits, and whole episodes of NOTHING happening. I've seen some SLOW anime, but Goblin Slayer can be just as slow as any despite the fact it's supposed to be a mindless, cathartic action show about slaying goblins! My offline friends are all American comic fans that have what MAL would call \"casual\" taste. They watch stuff like Slayers, Code Geass, Fairy Tail, Overlord, and My Hero Academia. It can be pretty awkward for me to explain that I'm watching a show about girls who're slowly learning to be better gondola tour guides in space Italy. People ask \"why in the FUCK would you watch something that boring?! Yet somehow, half the episodes of Goblin Slayer are more boring than any episode of Aria. They managed to make slaying hordes of goblins more boring than watching someone learn to row a gondola. Even the climactic battle at the end of the series is boring. It ends up being around 100 B, A, and S class warriors vs 200 little goblins and 10 slightly bigger goblins. It's a one sided curb stomp battle just like basically every battle in this series! Instead of watching the anime version of Helm's Deep, I find myself chanting \"THIS IS BORING! (Clap Clap ClapClapClap)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\n\"Ah...I see\" - Goburin Srayer Sama\\n\\n\r\nThe characters might actually be the worst part of Goblin Slayer. Every character is purely one dimensional and is defined by 1 trait. Goblin Slayer hates goblins and he slays them. That is his raison d'etre. That's as deep as we get into his character. Priestess girl is a support healer and her role is to offer support to Goblin Slayer. We don't know anything of her likes, dislikes, hopes or dreams. She exists to help Goblin Slayer. Dwarf likes to drink and hates elves because Tolkien. The Elf likes archery and hates dwarves because Tolkien. Lizard man likes cheese. The characters really aren't any deeper than this. All fictional characters lack the immense complexity of real people. That's a fundamental truth of writing. However, if they're interesting to us then we begin to fill in their inner thoughts, motivations, and we add sub-text. I just can't see anyone doing that with the Goblin Slayer cast. There is simply nothing interesting about ANY of these characters.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this anime is just butt ugly or \"boogly\" if you will. The CGI isn't quite as bad as Berserk 2016 or 2017, but it is still just depressing to look at. I was rewatching Stand Alone Complex recently and noticed the CGI in that series has aged poorly, but modern anime CG just isn't much better. The quality of American CGI animation has grown exponentially better in the last 20 years. We had a BAD phase around the year 2000 when we were putting out cartoons like Butt Ugly Martians, but America got beyond that early stumbling phase. Since anime has much tighter schedules and tighter budgets, the CGI never really improved that much. There are rare exceptions like Advent Children, Gantz 0, and King's Glaive. However, I would argure that CGI as a whole has been overwhelmingly detrimental to anime. When CG use is limited like the Stands in JoJo or explosions in Hellsing Ultimate, or even the vectors in Elfen Lied, it can be passable with a small budget. When you try use CGI as a lazy crutch like the Berserk reboots or Goblin Slayer, it gets BAD. Basically, use CG very sparingly unless you have a lot of time and/or a massive budget.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nPeople have asked me, \"Is Goblin Slayer really that bad?\" Honestly, the answer is Yes. It really is that bad. Even Inuyashiki had the anime Trump speech. I can only think of maybe one scene in all of Goblin Slayer that made me smile. A priestess who was raped by goblins asks the Goblin Slayer to have pity sex with her since men will no longer go near her. He just shuts her down in the most deadpan manner with a line like \"I'm not here to cuddle! I just slay Goblins dude! Now if you need any goblins slain, THEN I can help you!\" When that exchange is the best part of your entire anime, you deserve that 2 out of 10. Goblin Slayer isn't my vote for worst anime of year. That would be Magical Girl Site. However, it is still an atrocious anime and a complete waste of your time. No matter how much people talk about it online, I would recommend skipping this one.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Review on the first 4 episodes.\r\nThe very first episode set a very strong impression. I feel that a lot of people forgot all about how we recently survived an era of very uninspired and generic isekai / fantasy anime, then when Goblin Slayer emphasized the presence of these tropes viewers didn't see it as the intended bait and switch - they only saw the bait. So many shows, including large amounts of battle-magic-highschool anime from eras passed had main characters who were very one note just like Priestess appeared to be for our first impression before actually digging into what a blindly optimistic and faithfulhealer would think during these adventures. What resulted in the first episode's premier was a lot of lazy criticism.\\n\\n\r\nWhat also followed were several debates about how the goblins are just a plot device (or shallow), whether or not it's fine for an antagonist to be just a device or if it's good story structure to have the antagonist(s) vilified first. To anyone who argues either of these points, do keep in mind that man vs nature is a very popular trope found in several stories - and very many fun action movies have villains serve as bowling pins for the main character to defeat. One other popular arguing point was the \"throw-away\" characters presented in the show also being shallow and not well introduced, but many people forget about several shows that are praised doing something very similar to Attack on Titan.\\n\\n\r\nNow to critique the show instead of critiquing the critique; \\n\\n\r\nWhat I find the most exciting is the presentation of our main character, Goblin Slayer. The common fantasy main-character is usually plucky, well spirited, and adventurous, usually getting out of situations with his sheer force of will or special talent against an unknown enemy after we're grown to \"love\" him from a sad, characterizing flashback. Goblin Slayer is the exact antithesis to this. He is practical, calculated, imaginative, and knows his enemy very well while his origins are unknown. On top of that, rather than being a charismatic character the people around him are drawn to, Goblin Slayer is shown to be less capable of socializing and is someone who needs to heal overtime - a more believable character to put it simply. The main character alone was enough to intrigue me to invest in this show.\\n\\n\r\nThere's no denying that Goblin Slayer isn't what most people would call a high art, the next Gurren Lagann or Berserk, but the show very much serves its purpose as a fun adventure series or a fun subversion of generic fantasy anime. You wouldn't grade a fish on how it climbs a tree so to speak.\\n\\n\r\nScores\\n\\n\r\nStory (7): A simple but functional story that's been painted out from the first couple of episodes, and seems to be a slow-cook to a satisfying character-driven ending. However the second episode prompted debates about how Goblin Slayer's flashback served the story. On one hand the lack of episode one characterization was what many critics disliked of the show, but on the other hand it served extremely well to have our main character seem ambiguous and ominous. \\n\\n\r\nArt (7): Functional. The many sets feel very lived in with a great sense of space, along with thought-out details that goes into even dank caves, ruins, or meeting rooms. But the sets do lack textures in some portions and it doesn't live up to many contemporaries. The character designs on the other hand are very distinct and the action in the very first episode is very satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nSound (6): Once again, functional. Nothing about the soundtrack stands out one bit and the sound effects for the action scenes are appropriate at best. Nothing feels inventive or experimental and the action could gain more weight with better sound design.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (10): As I mentioned above, it is fantastic to have a main character who's the exact antithesis of plain, generic, insulting, isekai shows we've had to suffer through. The side characters have plenty of small moments too which characterizes them very well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10): Should be plain to see through my praise from before. I've actually found myself jumping in my chair the moment a new episode is posted, and it's fantastic to see the niche of fans from the Manga / Light novel coming out of the woodwork. I've also loved the many conversations and discussion after every episode.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 40/50 (8): A very satisfying show for people who like character-driven shows with moments of intrigue and seeing someone prevail with wit over strength. Goblin Slayer is a very firm suggestion should someone be okay with the graphic nature.",

            "content": "Goblin Slayer is a unique fantasy story about paranoid mentally broken wierdo who wants to commit genocide on a green raping barbarians. In a Dungeon&Dragons setting using homerules.\r\nIs it Dark Fantasy? Yeah, sort of, BUT NO BECAUSE OF  \"MUH RAPE\", you goddamn millennials, but because in the world of GS you are a pawn in the hands of Gods, you will die when  certainGod roll D20=1 and you can do nothing about it. You cannot win because Gods, eventually, will create another scenario where demon lord resurrected or necromancers destroy your hometown or goblins destroy your village. But you also cannot loose, becauseGods will also spawn heroes on your side who will keep balance and endless war going.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory - Anime is retelling events of first 2 volumes of ranobe (or light novel, who cares), cutting worldbuilng, character thoughts and 70% of details. Thats pretty sad but without full season necessary. \\n\r\nIts always very simple on surface - GS on a quest to kill some goblins (you dont get to see his routine, only the epic quests shown), but its always a different place, different threat level, different boss. And its not just \"goblins sitting in dungeon waiting to be slaughtered\", they are planning some bad things. So while it looks like a simple goblin slaying there is always something more, but I dont wanna spoil things.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt - meh, from pretty good to \"ahaha oh wow\". Better use your imagination (your strongest weapon) while reading source material, or AT LEAST manga. \\n\\n\r\nSound - every theme fits the situation and place, from peaceful town/guild music to intense \"overcoming the odds\" battle themes. I am just waiting full OST release, cant fully judge it now.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nGS - your main character. People's hero, defender of frontier villages from green shits, a silver ranked (third rank) adventurer who is actually obsidian (9 rank) in terms of strength, paranoid, autistic and simple man. Fighter+Ranger+Scout multiclass. Normalfags (both in his world and IRL viewers) dont understand him, but he doesnt care. Obsessed with guess what, and has a good reasons for it.\\n\r\nPriestess - second MC. Shy and kind girl in the beginning who will change A LOT in future. Idealistic, pretty strong magic caster for her level, one of the best female characters I've seen in like 10 years or so, with her own mind, motivations, strengths, weaknesses, without forced \"muh stronk independent wamen\" or being \"token appendix to MC (ahem, Asuna, ahem)\". True support who can carry whole party.\\n\r\nDwarf Shaman - typical dwarf, I would say, if typical dwarfs were magic casters. But they usually dont. In any case, if you love fantasy you probably love dwarfs - these short, sometimes drunk, sometimes grumpy, but loyal and honest folk are a great battle-bros, so nothing wrong with being \"typical dwarf\".\\n\r\nLizard Priest - one of the most serious (and probably strongest) party members. Lizardman is not a common species in a fantasy settings (usually they are just one of neutral secondary races who no one cares about), so seeing one is pretty refreshing. Wants to PURGE HERESY and become a Dragon. Isnt that a noble and relatable goal?\\n\r\nHigh Elf Archer - flat tsundere and normie, very young and optimistic (but you dont want to make her angry). Despite what animeonly thinks not a part of the harem (more on that later).\\n\r\nGuild Girl - older sister type character, competeting in GS-bowl with Cow Girl. Pretty cute in source material, but only a side-character in anime (I think Witch got more screentime than a Guild Girl).\\n\r\nCow Girl - choldhood friend (childhood friends never win, remember that). Yet again another victim of anime adaptation with no screen time or personality. Guess you have to read the fucking book if you care!\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nHere comes the most important. Why do people (and me) enjoy Goblin Slayer?\\n\r\n  1. Classic tropes done right - your typical fantasy setting, but without bullshit isekai OP characters, without subverting expectations (except for the \"goblin are stupid as kids\" part) and without trying to be more than it is.\\n\r\n  2. Rooting for underdogs. You see GS is weak as fuck compared to for example Lancer. So even if he fights the weakest monsters in the world he has to be careful and come up with new tactics and ideas. And if it wasnt enough there is always some greater threat that can smash and disintegrate our MC in 1x1 match. So even if you expect Goblin Slayer to prevail  from the beginning you never know how this battle will end.\\n\r\n  3. References. I fucking love references and there are A LOT OF THEM. Ignoring D&D part since its a part of the setting -\\n\r\nLord of the Rings (Orcrist-Orcbolg, master Bilbo, lembas)\\n\r\nWarhammer FB\\n\r\nDoom\\n\r\nBatman\\n\r\nPunisher\\n\r\nMini-Guts\\n\r\nMini-Lancer aka C\u00fa Chulainn\\n\r\nPlatinum hero Haruhi\\n\r\nAnd so on, its too hard to remember them all.\\n\r\n  4. Tonal shifts. What I heard many people complain about and getting it wrong. If you go full \"tea and cake party\" you get boring slice of life. If you go full \"blood and gore\" you get boring bloodbath. GS is about adventurers. Life of adventurer is about having fun while you can between the quests. Tomorrow you can die, but today you will laugh, drink and spend time with your party. What is the point of worrying about absolutely random dice rolls? Thats why tonal shifts are great and fit here. If you want 100% grimdark - watch some News channel or think about routine work you will have to do until you become old and sick. Pretty dark huh? Already want to forget  about it using good old \"tea and cakes\" method? So dont blame adventurers for distracting from routine stress.\\n\r\n  5. Compenent characters. At least most of them, but dont blame fucking noobs. You would also never expect that a level 1 giant rat can kill you when you start playing game.\\n\r\nAnd I am not even talking about Goblin Slayer, thats obvious part. The rest of his squad and even side characters (specially Lancer and Guts) has their own views and solutions to the problems. And most important that they respect each other views. So many stories show how MC knows everything better than anyone else, how he is perfect and others (mostly girls from harem) praise him. But here MC is experienced only when it comes to goblin slaying. Others use his knowledge and provide theirs.\\n\r\n  6. Romance. \"Oh look every girl like GS, bullshit stupid slice of life harem dropped\". Aaaaand you are wrong. A common mistake for a beginner. Its all about love triangle between Cow Girl and Guild Girl (and potentially Priestess). Why do they love him? Skip the childhood friend part since its obvious. Guild Girl knows him for 5 years. Thats a lot of time to become attached to someone. And Priestess can become more than apprentice, but thats not the point. Also there is a Sword Maiden but no one cares about her. 2(3) girls love one stoic, reliable and good-looking guy, do you still think its so unrealistic and stupid? I think it totally makes sense. Specially if you think about some abomination like SAO where girls fall in love with MC after 1 day of meeting him instead of 5+ years of knowing each other.\\n\r\n  7. The way Main party interacts with each other. Its hard to describe but you know what I mean if you played at least one game from Bioware, or any MMO with friendly guild.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - most of my enjoyment comes from ranobe or manga,  I've been reading GS for 2 years now, its just impossible to forget about it and judge only the anime. \\n\r\nBut think of this - my friend could not enjoy Overlord S2 and S3 after reading source material. He said that anime just ruined entire arc and I trust him. With Goblin Slayer I read the source material and I still could enjoy the anime adaptation even if it has a lot of flaws and cut content. That means that adaptation is good, while the source material is great.\\n\\n\r\nTHE CRIME IS YOUR FOUL EXISTENSE, GOBLIN, THE SENTECE IS DEATH!",

MAL users seem to be obsessed with deeper meaning, symbolism, comments on society, and all deep things of that sort. But the thing is, this isn't 10th grade English class. I'm not watching anime for subtle comments on society. I'm watching anime for enjoyment. A psychopath and his 4 personality-less companionsgoing around killing goblins is fun to watch. Sure, the story is so simple that the light novel's arcs got rearranged in order, and the show still makes perfect sense, but is that really important? At the end of the day, this is a piece of entertainment. We're not reading The Grapes of Wrath here. Goblin Slayer is paper-thin no matter what angle you look at it from. Anime doesn't have to be deep to be entertaining.",

            "content": "Goblin Slayer. Everyone has heard of it, everyone talked about it.\r\nBut truly what is in it when we get rid of all the bs, hate and controversy?\r\nAn enjoyable experience.\r\nGoblin Slayer comes with a very unique concept and for a big chunk of the PTW audience the idea of a guy doing nothing but stomping rats all day, every day was pretty interesting. \r\n\"This guy does nothing but kill goblins\" sign me in.\r\nI definitely not expected something that mixed PTSD, literally a DND world, comedy and a hentai protagonist.\r\nStory: It has been shown to death the \"isekaish\" world of swords, dragons and magic. But GS worldwhile similar is actually a dungeons and dragons world.\\n\r\nReferences to monsters, DnD skill system, etc.\\n\r\nThe whole plot revolves around: Let's go kill goblins, oh no \"x\" happened, shit we somehow did it.\\n\r\n\"X\" most of the times is our MacGyver protagonist finding a way to abuse the DnD system and honestly those moments are really cool and pretty reminiscent of Jojo.\\n\r\nThe other half of the show is our party banter and interactions with each other while trying to integrate our hentai protagonist to do stuff with them.\\n\r\nIt's a pretty comfy show. It's not a gritty horror story about goblins raping women or a heavy monologue about fear and moving on and thats something a lot of people critizicing Goblin Slayer seem to think.\\n\r\nGoblin Slayer is not Berserk. Goblin Slayer is a fun, action packed show with a few serious moments and a ton of extra enjoyement can be extracted from it with said mentality.\\n\\n\r\nArt: When i heard \"White Fox\" it was like stars aligning to give me an awesome show but honestly when i saw the episodes the last thing going trough my mind was \"Wow it looks so beatifully animated\".\\n\r\nWhite Fox has completely dropped the ball on GS and a lot of times the show feels lifeless, cheap and boring.\\n\r\nThere are times where GS san is shown in 3D CGI but while they definitely break the inmersion they arent the second coming of the antichrist and are definitely endurable (endurable key word right there).\\n\\n\r\nSound: Nothing to complain. Rightfully by Mili fits the GS anime completely.\\n\r\nI never found any of the VA's being really off character or doing a poor work.\\n\r\nIf you are really stingy with this you might find stuff to criticize but wasnt able to find anything particularly annoying.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: GS is definitely the appeal of the show. If you are sick of these beta otaku MC's or these all mighty heroes whose power is directly linked to the strenght of their vocal cords then you'll love Goblin Slayer.\\n\r\nLike ep 12 tells us straight up \"Goblin Slayer is just a guy\"\\n\r\nHe is not all mighty so he plans ahead, a lot. He always thinks on his future confrontations and sets up skills, items or tactics to overpower any foe that crosses his path.\\n\r\nHe is like a 10 damage card that can multiply his damage when facing goblins or when using his brain and damn if the damage he receives when he is not in control is clear.\\n\r\nHis whole persona and his attitude towards his life (details like the fact that he doesnt carry strong weaponry to avoid the possibility of goblins stealing it from his dead body really are a cool addition) makes you feel on edge whenever a fight is on and the fact that you never feel that he is in anyway special or powerful add to this as well.\\n\r\nThe rest are all charming on his own way. I'm not a waifu kind of guy and i would like to see female characters doing more than just having massive tits, making cute faces, etc.\\n\r\nWhile the other male characters arent completely forgettable the show (just like me) has a love boner for Goblin Slayer so he is practically the only dude you will have eyes for on more than one way.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: The holy grail of anime or actually any form of entertainment.\\n\r\nWho cares if something is preciously animated with jaw dropping scenarios if the enjoyment you can get from it is the same as watching the paint dry.\\n\r\nPerfect.\\n\r\nThere are not many words for it. I loved Goblin Slayer and that's all there is to it.\\n\r\nThe show doesnt try to bullshit you or tries to pretend to be something mature.\\n\r\nAnd to be honest that's something that while a lot of shows do, there are many that go overboard with it and you almost feel that you are being made fun of while watching it.\\n\r\nIf you wanna have some damn fun and watch religiously everything that a dude that never shows his face and respondes to everything using as few words as possible then Goblin Slayer is definitely the show for you.",

            "content": "Well to tell the truth the main plot is pretty straightforward there is a guy named Goblin slayer who kills Goblins as his name suggests. And that's basically it! But don't just give up on this yet because what it lacks in plotline it makes up for it by its visually pleasing art and fight scenes. I think plotwise it can be compared to one punch man.\r\n     Goblin Slayer has a very typical fantasy world setting with magic, swords, adventurers and monsters. Goblins are the lowest class monsters thus normally people underestimates as small fries. Butthey cause a lot of problems to the villages by stealing foods and cattles, destroying farms and even kidnapping young women. The Goblin Slayer has made it his life goal to exterminate each and every one of this pests due to past event in his childhood.\\n\\n\r\n      A pretty unique thing about this anime is that it doesn't have any name for the characters. I actually didn't realized it until episode 2. The opening song is my new favorite. Overall I'd say it is worth watching this.\\n",

            "content": "Goblin Slayer is in hot waters right now and I feel I must address that. I also have my own personal problem with the show unrelated to the controversy: namely its action scenes. But before I undress and nail this series\u2019 fight scenes hard, I want to set a couple of things straight first. Let\u2019s not jump into the nailing part without context, because that\u2019s just\u2026 stupid. \r\nFirst thing\u2019s first. Grimdark, in and of itself, is not a criticism. At best, grimdark is a style, a poorly defined one, even by the lowered standards of classification in the field of Literature. Others would contend thatit is a simplified catchall term that has been used to unfairly dismiss certain fantasy works that do not conform to what a certain pompous writer calls the \u201cSpirit of Tolkien\u201d, whatever that means.\\n\\n\r\nFor the purpose of this discourse, we take grimdark as a style, one that focuses on grit and gray non-Manichean morality. Like all styles, there's going to be generally bad and good examples.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is looking like it\u2019s going to be one of the bad examples. But I\u2019m willing to give it the benefit of the doubt, in the minute chance that the anime diverges a bit and grows the pair that the manga and the LN can\u2019t. I\u2019m not hopeful though. Neither should you.\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s talk about good and bad grimdark though so that you, the audience, can judge for yourself, because I see a lot of people jumping into this bandwagon with phrases like \u201cso realistic\u201d and \u201cif you don\u2019t want realism, go back to your Hello Kitty stuff and STFU\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nThere are two main recurring problems I\u2019ve observed in bad serious grimdark works.\\n\\n\r\nThe first one, one that this show is exhibiting worrying signs already, is that bad grimdark, like most bad writing, is in a massive hurry to get to the good stuff of the story to the exclusion of all else and shot their pacing to bits along the way. They\u2019re so scared of losing their audience because they have nothing else going on except shock and brutality. The moment they slow down for an introspective look, their rank garbage writing shows. They can rarely give a moment the clarity, hilarity, or gravity it deserves.\\n\\n\r\nThe second and most crucial sign of bad grimdark is that it absolutely refuses to hurt any of its main casts beyond backstory fluff and trauma that appears and/or disappears quickly and conveniently when the author has no need of it.\\n\\n\r\nThat is in direct betrayal to one of the core appeals of the style.\\n\\n\r\nGrimdark fantasy allows its characters greater agency and with it comes consequences. Simply put, a character doesn\u2019t have black and white choices but varying shades of gray. Each choice has consequences, the number, scale, and execution of which depends on the skill of the author. The concept of greater agency and corresponding consequences helps grimdark works build up the tension, because if you consume enough stories, you generally know which characters are going to survive until the end or at least until the final act. But in grimdark works a lot could still happen even if they survive. Not only are they\u2019re open to grow and develop through their choices but they also face possible negative consequences up to and including personal harm through say mutilation. They could lose a hand, a tongue, or a penis, and their narrative then towards how it affects them from here onward.\\n\\n\r\nPeople say that they tend to gravitate towards grimdark because they\u2019re tired of the fluffy bunny shows. But that\u2019s exactly what bad grimdark is, a fluffy bunny show wearing black paint. \"Wolololo this is a dark gritty world and people get hurt, except out main characters because they're main characters \".\\n\\n\r\nPlain old violence can and still do elicit powerful impact when done right, with proper build-up and context. But bad grimdark\u2019s hesitance to hurt its main casts pushes the brunt of the violence into the unimportant background characters. And background characters dying or suffering rarely elicit anything, so bad grimdark has to escalate.\\n\\n\r\nAnd Goblin Slayer escalates. Into rape.\\n\\n\r\nNow we segue on to the rape scene, because you must be curious about my take on it.\\n\\n\r\nEh. I have lived for a tad more than two decades on this Earth. I have seen far worse. At least it\u2019s not the manga which has a tendency to fetishize the rape scenes.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I want to do here is attempt to give you an idea of how Goblin Slayer incorporates rape in its narrative.\\n\r\nRape, in Goblin Slayer, seems to be deliberately conceived and written to add elements of shock factor. The author made the goblins a male-only species. There's no reason for them to be a male-only species but the author made them one and pushed rape as their only means of reproduction. Ergo the author wrote the story precisely in such a way that it has to include rape.\\n\\n\r\nWhy it has to be included? Well, I think it's simply a by-product of the escalation-of-violence/violence-arms-race in the entertainment media ever eager to snatch the attention of a viewing public that's becoming increasingly desensitized to violence. Escalation to one rung higher in the ladder into sexual violence is simply inevitable. If the author so chooses, the goblins could have had female specimens and not be purely male that relies on rape to multiply. And the fact that goblins raid and pillage villages of their crops while burning the villagers' homes and fields is reason enough to hunt them down without resorting to overly relying on rape to emphasize why they must be kept down. But it's what snatches attention nowadays because violence is already mainstream enough.\\n\\n\r\nThe second thing is that rape is used as a call to action. Not of the victim, but of the protagonists. The eponymous character is waging goblin genocide because goblins raided his village and raped and kidnapped/killed his elder sister. The priestess witnessed to the rape of one of her party member and sticks to her saviour the Goblin Slayer in the aftermath.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s not an exploration of rape and its aftermath here but rather a cheap gimmick. And so we come to the controversy that sparked. This is mainly what fans the flames of the detractors of the rape scene in Goblin Slayer: because it\u2019s just another one of those gimmicky works they\u2019ve read already from amateur grimdark authors in the West. Goblin Slayer is not the first or the ten thousandth to do this and earn ire. It may be the first anime you\u2019re familiar with that got into this mess, if you only care about anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe controversy is ridiculous actually. Basically, what happened was that Twitter has a little outrage, especially since Goblin Slayer\u2019s rating used to be PG-13. Who cares? Twitter does that every other hour, perhaps (I\u2019ve never been active on Twitter). Apparently the fans did and they went into full defense mode in preparation for the massive \u201cSJW attack\u201d, catching even more attention and it became a self-fulfilling prophecy.\\n\\n\r\nNow we\u2019re in this mess. Allow me to take this moment to clarify this controversy for both sides.\\n\\n\r\nThe detractors are simply asking for authors to treat it with proper respect and gravity.\\n\\n\r\nThe fans need to understand that that\u2019s the message. They\u2019re generally not calling for censorship of rape in fiction but a better handling of a perennially badly handled topic.\\n\\n\r\nThe detractors also need to understand that most of the fanbase are honestly disturbed by it too but they\u2019re treating their disturbed reactions as a triumph of the Goblin Slayer\u2019s storytelling rather than a failure in handling a sensitive topic.\\n\\n\r\nThe last point about rape I want to make is that rape IS a sensitive topic. Not only because it is continuously mishandled by amateur authors in a way that seems to imply that worth of their female characters are inherently tied to their sexuality and sense of purity (especially since it\u2019s curious to note that a large part of rape victims in fiction are pretty and nubile, and even virgins). It\u2019s also because of how rape is. Several people have come forward in defense of Goblin Slayer by saying \u201cWhy do we have to tread lightly when it comes to rape but not about murder?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nHere\u2019s the thing: there are a multitude of reasons for why one person murders another. How many reasons can you name for why a person rapes another? A murder can be framed as a good act, or a lesser of two evils. A rape can\u2019t. It\u2019s an inherently evil act that can\u2019t be framed any other way which then usually causes it to take center point in the ensuing discussions.\\n\\n\r\nNow let\u2019s go to my main problem with this show.\\n\\n\r\nI came into Goblin Slayer with 25 chapters of the manga under my belt. I know what to expect. I just came here for the action. Goblin Slayer is a story about a guy killing goblins, mostly.  Its story is nothing more than a thinly veiled attempt to connect one fighting scene to another. It\u2019s a dumb action series, is what I\u2019m expecting. And I\u2019m okay with what. I love the occasional dumb action flicks. Who doesn\u2019t?\\n\\n\r\nBut I do have standards.\\n\\n\r\nI like realistic takes on fighting because 1.) they\u2019re rare, 2.) I highly appreciate their research and dedication, and 3.) as someone pursuing a career in the field of biology, I want to see the human body pushed to its absolute limits.\\n\\n\r\nI also like unrealistic fighting with jaw-dropping choreography. I love Boyka: Undisputed (2016) even though I also watch MMA and the kind of blows that would cause at the very least dizziness in a real MMA match is just basically shrugged off in the movie and there\u2019s little to none of the awkward grappling. That\u2019s fine. Frankly, I just want to see awesome tightly choreographed fights and Boyka: Undisputed absolutely delivered.\\n\\n\r\nGoblin Slayer doesn\u2019t deliver. A good action series lives or dies with its fight scenes. The one other thing that could elevate a fight scene is the story behind the fight and the fighters. Given Goblin Slayer\u2019s setup, there\u2019s none of that. It\u2019s a guy mowing goblins left and right. So it has to bank on its fight scenes to actually be good in order for it to be considered good. And its fight scenes so far are garbage.\\n\\n\r\nIt refuses to use wide angle shots to properly convey the entirety of a fight. As I\u2019ve said again and again, a fight is a synthesis: thesis and anti-thesis, action and reaction. Here, there\u2019s still the tendency to have action occur in one frame, showing only one character, then the reaction in the next frame, showing the target. Refusing to show both action and reaction in one frame rids the viewer of a frame of reference to ground the action which ends up limiting the impact of a fight.\\n\\n\r\nThe action scenes are the easiest angle for the series to improve itself. And I hope they do. Because right now, Goblin Slayer is just insultingly mediocre. It\u2019s not the worst anime of the year, or even of the season. It\u2019s simply a very forgettable one that\u2019s going to be remembered more for the rape and the controversy than anything else.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading. Have a free pitchfork, on me:\\n\\n\r\n~~~~~~E\\n\\n\r\nCopy and paste it on my profile page if you disagree. It\u2019s better than harassing me on my profile page because that would not be helpful to Goblin Slayer\u2019s reputation at all.",

            "content": "Before I start I\u2019d like to mention that this anime isn\u2019t for everyone. If you\u2019re not good with disturbing themes then I\u2019d recommend another anime. Unlike most light novel adaptations this anime isn\u2019t a happy go lucky isekai. This show will have graphic scenes and will have lots of goblin slaying(duh).\r\nRelevance to the source material: 9/10\r\nSo far this anime has been faithful with the light novel. Only issue is the fact that the anime skipped through the back stories of some of the minor characters in the first episode.\r\nAnimations:8.5/10\r\nGreat animations. Very smooth though one thing I found odd was the fact that the goblin slayerwas animated with cgi while the goblins were not. Though I didn\u2019t dislike it in general I feel that the goblins should have also been made with cgi rather than being hand drawn. As for the cgi used with goblin slayer I think it fits his character well since his character does seem a bit mechanical.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9.5/10\\n\r\nAll the characters in the story are quite diverse and every single one seems to have a story of their own. Though the series doesn\u2019t touch too much on the past of the other characters the mc, goblin slayer, at least gets a clear explanation as to why he does what he does and what caused him to become the goblin slayer. The comical \u201cI want more goblins\u201d thing that he does every time he goes to the reception desk (spoiler? nahhhh...)has a reason and the reason isn\u2019t \u201ccause I feel like it\u201d or because of an obtuse sense of justice that a lot of characters tend to have in modern shows. \\n\\n\r\nSetting 9/10\\n\r\nThe world of goblin slayer is similar to dungeons and dragons. The gods throw the die and thus the fates of the heros of the series are determined. The author made it quite obvious that he is a big fan of d and d. Even the naming system in the show gives this away. Every character in the show is named by either their titles or occupations just like the pieces of d and d. The way the author built the setting is quite interesting. When watching the show I feel like I\u2019m watching what a dungeons and dragons game would look like if it was completely and honestly animated.\\n\r\nStory telling devices:9/10\\n\r\nGoblin slayer has an interesting way of telling the story. Even though the main character is obviously goblin slayer the perspectives we view goblin slayer from are from his companions. Instead of analyzing goblin slayer from his perspective we analyze him from the perspectives of his companions. This helps keep goblin slayer mysterious and keeps the viewers on your toes. Just like his companions even the viewer can be left wondering about what could possibly be going on in his head.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n",

There are basically no redeeming qualities to this show whatsoever, and the only reason I watched 4 episodes was to write this review.\r\nStory:\r\nThere is none. It's in a bland, incompetent episodic format where our hero Goblin Slayer goes and slays goblins. big surprise there. Every episode, there's a new place full of goblins, and everyone but Goblin Slayer ignores the quest because it's goblins and not something actually cool or interesting. But because of GS's tragically incompetent backstory, he feels likehe needs to go and kill the goblins, so he does. There are also some other characters, but none of them matter and all of them are so bland and useless that I literally do not remember what any of them do in any episode.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nIt reminds me of Death March to a Parallel World Rhapsody in how incompetent the art, animation and direction are as a whole, leaving a sense of vague incompleteness around the entire experience as you struggle to comprehend brainless shot composition and the stupidest shadow effects you have ever seen. Also, for some reason every once in a while GS's eye glows red and it's stupidest looking thing I have ever seen. Every time it happens all I can think of is the phrase 'sans undertale'.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nNothing notable here. OP sucks, ED sucks, the OST is for the most part a whole two generic metal tracks played on repeat for the entire goblin-slaying portion of each episode. The sound effects and sound design are not good, but they're not terrible either, so that part gets a pass.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe only memorable character is Goblin Slayer himself. I'll admit he has a good character design, but I can't help but be saddened by the fact that the show would have been about five times better if he was the silent character archetype. No one else is memorable except elf girl, and she's only memorable because she's so poorly written that I legitimately consider her as the worst character in any show ever. I have no idea how anyone thought that a 2000 year old character who acts about as naive as a 5 year old would work in any way. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI laugh at the sheer stupidity of the show while watching it with my friend. That's about it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nVery, very bad. extremely incompetent, no redeeming qualities. 1/10. .",

            "content": "Heh, Goblin Slayer? More like Rapist Slayer. \r\nAccording to an interview with the author on youtube, the one on theanimeman's channel, the \"story\" that so many haters seem to think that it was nonexistent are basically just ignorant and blinded to their bias.  There were even some people, one of the review with low rating below, seem to think that it's wrong for a show as dark as Goblin Slayer to have a cute character design, and as well as having a cheerful moment from time to time. Like dude, welcome to anime. This is nothing new. And yeah, this world is basically basedon a tabletop game. Which is probably why no characters in this show really do have a name. What you would mostly hear is their class name, or their race name. Which make sense since this is based on tabletop game concept. I find this part of the show is be very refreshing to see in an anime. \\n\\n\r\nIncidentally, those \"cheerful\" moments also serve as a way to teach us about the culture of different races, rather than just having an episode where they just explicitly spent 5 mins explaining the setting and culture of the elf, dwarf, and the lizardmen. They studio literally accomplish 2 things at the same time: party introduction, establishing their personalities and ethnicity and culture. It wasn't really a meaningless, and a one dimensional story telling at all where they are trying to only have us familiarize with the characters before they get fucking rekt in the future, that was not the goal of this show at all. That being said, \"don't judge a book by its cover\".  Goblin Slayer is one of those kind of show.\\n\\n\r\nSome people may think that this show is going to be heavy, heavy, heavy, and heavy throughout episode 1 to the very end of season 1, but the anime has already proven us wrong. Episode 1 may serves as an episode that has invested the highest level of the shock factor, however, you gotta remember that much like in ep 3, episode 1 is basically world building and teaching us the culture of the Goblins.\\n\\n\r\nI could name at least 6 things here that were hinted there in episode 1: Goblins use poison dagger to make up for their weaknesses, Goblins are led by Shamans, Goblins would always use raped victims as a bait to catch the adventurer off guard (that's why Goblin Slayer waited instead of going in), Goblins use Totems to ambush adventurers, Goblin uses women for reproduction (as said by the Goblin Slayer in ep 1), Goblins blood are thick (thus dulling the blade) so Goblin Slayer had to keep changing his weapon, and so on.  So yes, episode 1 isn't all about the shock factor, its world building. \\n\\n\r\nNow some may say that it was unnecessary for there to be rape in episode 1, but hey, the goal of this episode was to have us hate the Goblins, not really to have us sympathize or get horny with the raped victims. That was why the anime decided to cut the portion of the 3 fodder character's backstory (which is in the manga and the light novel) and proceeded to show how fucked up the Goblins are, but most importantly, the anime cut out like 80% of the rape scenes in the manga. Meaning that this anime is way lighter than the manga and you shouldn't be needlessly getting trigger for no reason.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now, which would be more impactful do you guys think? Simply talking about the fact that Goblins \"eat and rape\" women, or actually showing the scene for us audience to know what the victims had to go through. I would say the latter if you are trying to have us hate someone. It's the same thing when you see ISIS chopping a baby's head or a head of a nude women on liveleak, instead of hearing some news about it on articles. You would hate them even more if you had seen the former. \\n\\n\r\nAs far as the MC goes, I love the guy. This is probably one of the most unique MC out there in anime. His personality is not only realistic, but it has alot of depth to it that was mostly easy to understand and predictable. That said, him being monotone, is that a bad thing? No. This is actually a good thing since I could imagine a guy who had to hide and watch his sister and the entire villagers being tormented and raped being this socially awkward. This is what isolation do to you. You lost nearly all the ability to communicate like a normal human being, especially when you're seeing raped victims every single day, being raped and killed by Goblins, eventually your emotions would become so deaden to the point where you wouldn't become expressive at all no matter how hard you tried. \\n\\n\r\nAnd unlike those OP characters in a fantasy world, Goblin Slayer is not some lv 100 player or some shit, he's an average joe who uses his brain to make up for his lack of power. Which typically not something we would see nowadays. Additionally, from my understanding, it felt like the way spells works in this world is actually quite similar to Pokemon games. Where there are limited uses for a certain spell that you cast instead of using the MP system... \\n\\n\r\nThough, that aside, if you didn't enjoy the first episode because you didn't understand the purpose of it aside from assuming that it's just shock factor for the sake of shock factor with no context, or story; you should definitely check out at least 4 episodes before making your final judgement on a show that's only been aired recently. You can't judge the whole show if you didn't see the entirety of it yet. And this is a very good show. I would highly recommended it to alot of people, but ofc, there are personal preferences for everything so if you're a snowflakes, then don't watch this anime lol.",

            "content": "Goblin Slayer is about a man who wants to kill all goblins because of what happened in his past it's a classic a revenge story because if he doesn't do it who will. As the story goes along we will see as he starts to change and why he hates goblins and why he's the only high class adventurer going after them. \r\nThe Story \r\nThe story is very simple at the start as shown in the in the anime it's about killing goblins and how weak but dangerous they are they will kill, steal and rape for survivor cause like titans in AOT there justlike that it's in their nature. Later on in the manga we find out just how strong and clever some goblins can be which is terrifying they can learn and get stronger so as goblin slayer does it's best to kill them off before they get strong. So as the story will go on it will get more interesting as it goes along so i'm looking forward to more of the anime \\n\\n\r\nThe Art \\n\r\nThe animation in the show was well done the only compliant is the cgi sometimes times is noticeable but they only used it from far shots on goblin slayer or when he's standing still which is clever to do since we never see his face it's not noticeable at parts. The action was well made making every hit, stab and burn look painful which is the point this is a dark show it's not for the faint of heart. \\n\\n\r\nThe Sound \\n\r\nThe music and the sound affects much the show when something needs to be epic it's epic when something has to be chilling it's chilling. The voice actors do a great job as well from new hopeful adventures to terrified people who where not ready for a mission so ya overall sound was good. \\n\\n\r\nThe Characters \\n\r\nThe characters in Goblin Slayer are simple but in a good way cause we get to know them as the story goes along we only know a little bit about Goblin Slayer but as the manga goes on they hint on who trained him. But aside from that we only learn bits and pieces so right now there's not to much to say about them. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment \\n\r\nI had a blast watching the first ep they followed the first chapter and have only changed a little from each ep so i'm looking forward to the other 9 ep to come. \\n\\n\r\nOverall \\n\r\nWhile Goblin Slayer isn't for everyone because of its dark tones the show and manga are a great read and watch learning about different Goblins and how this world works for me it's a solid but for others maybe a 8 or 9 if you give it a chance instead of judging it on the first ep.\\n",

            "content": "Here lies a dark hero built with armor and a burning desire to destroy goblins. A man with little words, he speaks through action and is a nightmare to the goblin race. If you live in his world as a goblin, be afraid, be spiteful, and be prepared to die. In a world of darkness such as Goblin Slayer, death is a common word in the community. It\u2019s the sinister truth that cannot be avoided in a world of fear.\r\nIsn\u2019t the Internet just a wonderful place? Almost anyone these days with an education can pretty much write out their own fictional tale in some wayor other. Granted, most of us won\u2019t become accomplished writers like Kumo Kagyuu. As an author of the original light novels and manga, it\u2019s pretty clear that he was aiming to make Goblin Slayer into a dark fantasy story. As a testament of dark fantasy, what does Goblin Slayer really deserve? \\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s a book out there called \u201cControversy Creates Cash\u201d by wrestling personality, Eric Bischoff. To be honest, controversy is pretty much a word that describes Goblin Slayer from the start. In no less than a single episode, we get Goblin Slayer in the most gruesome ways possible. A fair warning before you read on: expect goblin rape. While the adaptation certainly does tones it down, goblin rape exists and may sway viewers\u2019 eyes away. Being a dark fantasy, goblins are the embodiment of evil and serves as the main antagonists. I should also say right off the bat that the goblins in this show lacks morality and behaves in a hive-like manner. In other words, they aim solely to torture, torment, and kill. There\u2019s zero amount of characterization about any of them as they lack basic human principles. Even their strategy seems to involve mindless slaughter in Blitzkrieg-like ways to overwhelm enemies. In general, goblins is portrayed as monsters that you should give absolutely no sympathy for. They are the symbolism of evil and it\u2019s up to Goblin Slayer to annihilate them.\\n\\n\r\nAs a titular character, Goblin Slayer bears a responsibility for himself. That is, he is the main carry of his party consisting of Priestess, High Elf Archer, Dwarf Shaman, and Lizard Priest. Goblin Slayer is what I\u2019d describe as a specialist. He solely takes on missions that involves slaying goblins and seems to avoid any others when requested. To me, I find this type of character portrayal to be risky. I mean, it gets more and more obvious that there\u2019s little character development for Goblin Slayer himself. Sure, there is companionship that he develops with his party members. This in turn grows into a level of trust but throughout the show, I never felt compelled to understand him. Even with some background story, he still just feels like the poster boy of the show with little characterization. I\u2019m not even sold on his character role after realizing he\u2019s solely build to slay goblins. It\u2019s pretty obvious that some of the female party members like Priestess and High Elf Archer begins to grow a certain level of attraction towards him. But what does our dark hero have in mind all the time? Goblin Slaying!\\n\\n\r\nBy mid-season, I think it\u2019s easy to also dissect the rest of the cast. As the main female protagonist, Priestess is the antithesis of Goblin Slayer. She\u2019s a gentle 15 year old adventurer with an innocent mind and willing to help others. The story progresses as she develops a growing trust towards Goblin Slayer although that\u2019s pretty much it. We don\u2019t get much characterization about her and as time elapses, it feels like she\u2019s just a standard adventurer playing the role of a mage like from some RPG game. The 2000 year old girl known as the High Elf Archer brings in more attitude into the show with a somewhat childish personality. This is a contrast to most of the other members of her party as she tends to react in outbursts. The Dwarf Shaman and Lizard Priest makes up the support of the party to provide invaluable assistance. Unfortunately, both characters are often overshadowed by the girls and Goblin Slayer himself. The only time Dwarf Shaman shines the most is when he gets into bickering with High Elf Archer. For the Lizard Priest, he\u2019s also more of the calm and character with few words. But really, this type of character casting is pretty much like following a video game. I\u2019m not inclined to say Goblin Slayer pay homage to adventure games but it has that sort of feeling. Unfortunately, that feeling doesn\u2019t equate to a well-polished set of characters. Even the Sword Maiden suffers from this with her tragic past. Sword Maiden\u2019s character pretty much represents the dark horrors of their world from her suffering. It\u2019s obvious that she\u2019s hiding her own insecurity and anxiety since her trauma. The reminder of the support cast like Witch and Cow Girl fills little more than dimensional adventurers with no character development whatsoever. And that\u2019s not a good thing to see.\\n\\n\r\nYou\u2019ve come this far and wonder if Goblin Slayer\u2019s story is capable of outshining the character cast. To be general, there\u2019s some condensing and rearrangement for the adaptation don\u2019t expect everything to be faithful. That\u2019s just the base of it though. The main story deals with the conflict between goblins and humanity. I didn\u2019t really understand the true purpose of the show even to the very end. It seems to be a gore feast made with the intention of showing the horrors of a dark fantasy. The show feels like a video game at times but hardly plays like one. This show is certainly not an isekai though so don\u2019t mistake one as such. But to be plainly honest, I think Goblin Slayer didn\u2019t capture the essence of effective storytelling. It\u2019s botched by textbook characters with mediocre writing at best and controversy at worst. \\n\\n\r\nDespite being a dark fantasy, Goblin Slayer stays truthful mostly with its premise and content. It evokes feelings of horror with its grimy art style and graphic violence. Character designs are equipped with fantasy attributes such as the elf ears, priestess robes, lizardman\u2019s body structure, dwarf roughness, etc. But you should also expect fan service. Characters like the Witch and Cow Girl are the most prominent examples of this. I\u2019d dare say that the author was trying to make some of the female characters as sexy as possible for little reason but to appeal to fan service. Speaking of which, the goblin slaying itself pretty much draws the gore and violence on every chance it gets. While I mentioned the anime being toned down before, there\u2019s no doubt the producers wanted to get a point across. And that\u2019s to show how sinister the world of Goblin Slayer can really be.\\n\\n\r\nWith a man of few words, Goblin Slayer is the man of the hour but unfortunately, this show doesn\u2019t live up to its catchy title. While I\u2019d say there were some memorable moments in the story, the show itself is ultimately too transparent and gets tedious fast. By the end of the show, I didn\u2019t find a true understanding of what this was really about. Companionship between the adventurers? Showing the grim reality of a dark fantasy world being populated by malevolent goblins? Or is it perhaps something more that the author wanted us to experience? Personally, I wouldn\u2019t look too far because in the end, this was just another anime that wasn\u2019t a big deal after you\u2019ve seen what it is. A show like Goblin Slayer may be talked a lot this year and more years to come. But, controversy will always be part of those talks.",

            "content": "When it comes to popular shows, people like to jump on bandwagons. They either absolutely adore it or utterly despise it. Due to the controversy first episode created, goblin slayer has attracted more people than it should have and the result is obvious.\r\nThe story takes place in a D&D inspired world where battle between the good and the evil is commonplace. The main character has gone through a traumatic experience in his childhood because of the infamous goblins and has decided to dedicate his entire life to eradicate them. So it is all about how cunning the goblins are and how goblin slayer comes upwith various methods to deal with them. As such it should be the only thing one should expect before watching the show. Otherwise they may get disappointed. \\n\\n\r\nEven though the premise is simple, it doesn't get repetitive because the situations he finds himself in changes everytime and his methods change as well. There are several classes of goblins, and some of them are significantly powerful. It made matters more challenging for goblin slayer and his party. So I was pretty much entertained throughout. \\n\\n\r\nMany people say that goblin slayer has plot armor. Well what do you expect? The name of the show is Goblin Slayer after all! Just like Naruto, Ao no exorcist, Mob psycho 100 etc. Having plot armor and being overpowered are entirely different things. Having plot armor is not a bad thing. Being consistently overpowered may become a problem because sometimes such a story becomes unbelievable. But GS is not overpowered and he struggles to kill the goblins. He uses unconventional methods to kill them. That is the strength of the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are clearly the weakest part of the anime. They are all one dimensional and are only there to help goblin slayer. However, while I would have loved to see some backstory for each character, it doesn't matter as the story is only about GS. Only character to grow over time is Goblin Slayer himself. He initially keeps everyone at a distance and only obsessively cares about goblins. The fact that we can't see his expressions due to the ever present helmet doesn't help either. But by the end of this season, he has slowly changed a bit and is slightly more sociable. I don't know how much more he develops beyond the storyline adapted in the anime. But for 12 episodes, that is a decent progress.\\n\r\nThe animation is above average. Sometimes there is use of CGI while goblin slayer walks. It is unnecessary and looks weird. The action scenes are decent. One thing I disliked is the mild unnecessary fanservice. It is not omnipresent throughout the entire show, but the way it is done (with weird physics, unnatural clothes etc) breaks the immersion in the story. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening song done by Mili is very good and makes the anime feel like some dark fantasy. It is a shame that it is not really a dark fantasy however. The ED is a bit bland and is not to my liking. The rest of the soundtrack doesn't stand out much either.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR - Goblin Slayer is a decent anime. It is neither one of the best, nor one of the worst shows out there. It is quite enjoyable if you know what to expect from it.",

            "content": "Goblin Slayer was a pretty divisive series; On one side of the argument are those who see the show as the epitome of dark fantasy within the medium of anime, on the other side there is those who disavow the series as racist. Although both arguments have legitimate points, they would ultimately be missing the point of the series. It\u2019s an escapist fantasy that merely contains iconography of the fantasy genre that has racist connotations. What should be said first and foremost, is that many fantasy creatures, specifically monsters, were inspired by the works of J.R.R Tolkien. Since both the Hobbit and the Lord ofThe Rings were written in the 1930s, a lot of the characteristics that are ascribed to fantasy monsters were inspired by what he found alien, Tolkien would describe most of the monsters and creatures as amalgamations of characteristics that were shared by Africans and Asians. The goblins in The Lord of The Rings were described as smaller versions of the orcs, so many of the characteristics that made the orcs a racist representation of subaltern races, was shared with goblins. Since Tolkien more or less defined the fantasy genre, the lore and ideas that have been used in his works were emulated or added onto by various different creators through the years. The property that Goblin Slayer takes the most influence from is D&D; every character is named after a meta character toupes, for example, the elf ranger is named Elf. The dwarf is called Dwarf. They are named after the role they have in the party, like the Priestess, or after the species they are a part of, like the Lizardman. The characters of the series are defined/characterized by their character tropes. I am not sure if this is a commentary on the fantasy genre, or an even more meta commentary on the anime genre. The elf ranger has the combined depth of a generic ranger character, and the average tsundere in a trashy harem show. Based on how the characters are used, it is only natural that the monsters that the main characters are also defined by their cliche nature. The Goblins are represented as violent, dumb, weak, and greedy. It\u2019s more or less in line with traditional representations of this species, however, there are some aspects that differentiate the representation that is found in D&D and Goblin Slayer. The biggest aspect of the two representations that differentiate the two is that the Goblins can only reproduce via raping women of different species. This parasitic existence of theirs made me somewhat sympathetic to the creatures, all of their \u201cevil\u201d actions are in fact justified from their perspective. Calling them evil is just more or less reductive to the narrative. However, any moral questions that GS does raise, is rendered inane by the story telling of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe main problem with GS is that it never really had any narrative focus, this is partially due to the weak character motivations of the protagonists. GS kills goblins as a form of revenge for his family, the Priestess follows GS because she wants that cock, the Elf hangs out with GS because she wants that cock, the Dwarf hangs out with GS because he seems to not have anything better to do, the Lizardman hangs out with GS because he wants his cheese. The only character with any motivation that could drive the series is Goblin Slayer himself, but his motivation is worn out like any other tired cliche. The secondary cast are just there to form the analogous party that is so very common in troupic discussions of D&D. This made most of Goblin Slayer feel repetitive, and lacking as a story. \\n\\n\r\nThe series raises moral discussions about the morality of killing goblins, but it never delivers on any interesting perspective. They kill goblins because that\u2019s what they should do; This made any thematic discussion of how the series implements it\u2019s themes to be extremely difficult. There are interesting concepts that are raised in the series, but how these ideas are integrated into the series was messy and contrived. This has lead many, specifically Wisecrack to make a video about Peace Theory and how \u201cGoblin Slayer subverts many troupes of the fantasy genre.\u201d I would argue that both of these readings are incorrect, the society of GS was never portrayed as particularly unified against an overwhelming force, like a society at war would be. The society of Goblin Slayer is portrayed like any other generic fantasy society is in the fantasy genre. The second argument of Wisecrack\u2019s video on the series argues that GS is a deconstruction of the fantasy genre due to the scale of the series being seemingly limited in comparison to the metacontextual reading of the fantasy genre. It is true that the series is focused primarily on goblins, and that \u201ctraditionally\u201d the characters would be facing off against the demon lord by some point in the series. But in reality, GS is just an example of low fantasy, it is a more \u2018realistic view\u2019 of the fantasy genre because of how the fantasy in the series is portrayed more as an intrusive aspect of the world rather than a common aspect. In low fantasy series, smaller scales is common. That being said, based off of how the series has been escalating to this point, it is arguable that GS will eventually embody many of the troupes that are typical of the fantasy genre.\\n\\n\r\nThe series follows a very repetitive structure; Goblin Slayer gets a request to go on a quest, his party and him groups together, they kill goblins. Half way through the series, the characters are introduced to the Sword Maiden, she is supposed to be portrayed as a strong figure, since she was one of the heroes that killed the former demon lord. This representation is contrasted with the PTSD that she got when she was just an ametuer adventurer due to being raped by Goblins. As such, when she realizes that there are Goblins under the city, she requests that Goblin Slayer kills the goblins due to her fear of the creatures. After Goblin Slayer finishes his job, the Sword Maiden advances on Goblin Slayer sexually. This is just an example of how the series writes it\u2019s characters, it attempts to create some sort of depth by portraying them as formerly victimized, however, these portrayals are surface level and these details are often expressed through exposition dumps. As I mentioned beforehand, the characters lack any form of depth, it is epitomized in how these characters interact with each other, that I feel comfortable in disregarding the series as a simple power fantasy. Every single female character in the series is lusting after that GS penis, and every other character is characterized by the troupes that they embody. \\n\\n\r\nAs such, I can\u2019t recommend this show, it lacked any real intrigue, and the only interesting perspective that I could suggest as a framework for viewing the show is as a cynical, metanarrative on the fantasy genre and anime as a whole based on how GS utilized common archetypes. \\n",

            "content": "This review has two sections, first is my ep1 impressions, but given the huge furore about the fact that people made complaining that ep1 was necessary and the show as a whole is very good, I decided to have some good faith and watched the next 4 so I could be impartial. I was a little bit judgey in my initial impressions, so I think readers (especailly hardcore fans) will be very satisfied by the post 4ep impression overall.\r\n***Ep 1 impressions begin***\r\nSometimes there are anime that are so memorable, you just can't help but want to talk about it, whether it be the excellent storytelling,character depth/growth, the visuals/sound etc. . This is one of those times, but only because it is just utter garbage. \\n\\n\r\nThere is so much that is off about this anime, it's honestly hard to know where to start. \\n\\n\r\nApparently this country's guilds attempt to control the goblin population, seen as pests, and a big problem, by sending party after party of hapless adventurers to their deaths, or to be unwilling seed beds for more goblins, completely unguided, with little to no instruction, support, or warning. This premise on it's own defies all logic, so we don't even need to get into the gratuitous hentai-like \"setting\", unfathomable plot hooks and irrational life choices of the characters in the first episode that clearly know better, but do it anyway.\\n\\n\r\nSo, why is this anime, which is apparently a solid adaption, so popular and enjoyed? Put simply, the anime is appealing to those that value edgy, fetishistic tragedy over good storytelling, or characters that have the mentality of a bunch of DnD players sitting around a table munching junk food and swilling sugary drinks, who only care about when their turn is next to roll the dice. Put more simply, this is an anime for kids, or I should say those that have the mentality and maturity of kids. \\n\\n\r\nIf anyone has read this far (congrats! You're likely one of those that AREN'T the immature adult-children) then it behooves me to point out that I'm not against these types of scenarios at all. Gensou no Grimgar has a plot in a slightly similar vein, where inexperienced people are in the predicament of needing to party up, have poor equipment and zero experience, but need to fight the gobbos to put food on the table. Yet they suffer similar circumstances where they hunt gobbos, get overconfident, overrun, and one of their group dies. It was masterfully executed too, with visceral emotion, impact, and leaves the watcher moved. What they didn't do, is resort to cheap ploys like goblin rape, or ridiculously dumb character choices/motivations or wholly irrationally contrived scenarios to set the context that gobbos are bad, and need sum kill'in.\\n\\n\r\nGoblin Slayer is a failure as a story, but ironically probably won't fail as an anime because they are clearly not appealing to sophisticated storylines, they're going for sophistry, in the hope that most people are only interested in gritty action, facilitated by dumb characters, set in a world that seems intent on depopulating itself within several years by throwing thousands upon thousands of dumb, naieve \"adventurers\" (I get why they have porcelain badges now!) at the problem that never ends which in the process shatters lives, and is literally feeding the goblin dens with warm bodies that seem eager to be impregnated, while the rest of the populace yawns at all the young girls being stolen across the countryside to be used as goblin sex toys.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want a decent anime that actually isn't garbage, but you want to see adventuring, character growth, and some gobbo killing, watch Gensou no Grimgar, not Garbage Slayer.\\n\\n\r\n*** End Ep1 impressions, begin Ep4 review ***\\n\\n\r\nWarning, there may be slight spoilers from here on. \\n\\n\r\nWell, I'll just say, when I came into GS I expected nothing, and it's clear without a shadow of a doubt that this show is as basic as they come. My initial impressions that this would appeal to DnD players was spot on. Its amazing, but this anime actually got worse and worse each episode in. The story is your typical DnD campaign, with your typical teen-centric decision making, coupled with \"exotic\" but vacuous characters. The Arrested Development scene where Michael Bluth opens the bag that reads \"dead bird do not eat\", opens it, and says \"I don't know what I expected\" pretty much sums it up for me.\\n\\n\r\n4eps in, and things have barely changed from ep1, we've had repeated exposition about how goblins are \"bad\" almost no actual goblin killing, and \"world building\" to rationalise the stupid character decisions in the first ep, along with new veteran party members that act like novices when partying up with the GS that is only possible due to a massively specific situation. It reads out like a classic DnD game, and that's not a critic of DnD, I played hundreds of table top DnD game and dozens of campaigns as a kid and an adult. I simply know that DnD does not make for riveting and engrossing stories unless your audience has the maturity level of a teen. The author was clearly an avid tabletop player, and probably tried his hand recreating one of his campaigns, hence the shitty situational writing, garbage worldbuilding, and utter lack of depth. DnD does not make a good anime.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that brings me to the outrage of this fan base to even the minutest criticism of their beloved series. Essentially, they're the vegans of the anime world that absolutely MUST tell you how awesome their anime is, and that if you don't like it you're a horrible human being with bad taste (oh the irony). Because for them criticising GS is seen by them as criticising their taste, which is understandable because anyone that likes this DOES have poor taste, but unfortunately their little egos simply can't handle that. The mature among us accept that we have guilty pleasures, I love harem isekais, I LOVE IT! But I'm mature enough that I can handle people urinating over my beloved shows. I'm cool with that, and people that want to unload on Re:Zero/Isekai Maou/Death March etc. are welcome to, I can handle it. GS viewers lack that maturity, and that in itself is a sign that there is no deep thinking going on in this show whatsoever, just DnD drama that kids love, because YOLOing into a cave as a first level party is fun, even if the consequences are horrible.\\n\\n\r\nSo, to sum up realll quick, because I'm pertty much done with this,\\n\\n\r\nStory: 1. Generic, edgy violence, almost nonexistent world building, hugely flawed character rationalisations, etc. etc. etc. You get the idea.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 4. Its ok, probably the only redeeming feature.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4 Again, it's ok, nothing stellar though, but the VAs are good, but they honesly don't have much to work with. I feel for the poor VA that had to do the mage though with her \"speech impediment\" that sounded more like someone stopping and starting her voice track, that was painful to listen to...\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: *laughs*.....\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: As entertaining as a train wreck is, so.... -7?\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 1.\\n\\n\r\nFor people that like anime that makes sense, still has these \"oh fuck\" moments where a novice party gets overconfident and there's lots of gobbo killin, but doesn't try to be edgy and such, I still strongly recommend Gensou no Grimgar for your goblin fix. If you still LOVE GS and actually managed to read this far down, calm down, take a chill pill, and realise that your taste is bad, and thats ok. Watch your show, and stop having a heart attack over people trashing it. People are allowed to not like what you like.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEdit: couple typos.",

Often times in media goblins are portrayed as easy monsters to be killed by the dozens, however Goblin Slayer is not other media. Goblins are evil, vile, and must be killed at all costs. \r\nThrough out the anime Goblin Slayer's character is expressed through his actions rather than his words, allowing for the viewer to have to putthemselves in his shoes to understand him. Through the violence and gore, the viewer gets a better idea of the reason behind Goblin Slayers actions and then start to form a connection with him. He is also surrounded by a cast of characters who try to bring out the human side in him, making the few moments of personality he exhibits rewarding. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall plot helps move character development for the cast and bring out the best in the characters provided. Over time the viewer becomes more invested in the cast and wants to follow them on their journey. \\n\\n\r\nI recommend this if you enjoy a gritty action anime with character development from the journey. \\n\\n\r\nIf you are worried about the scenes in the first episode please push on and make up your own mind instead of only looking at the surface level or listening to a negative opinion.\\n\\n\r\nSorry for any grammar issues.",

            "content": "You ever watch a seasonal show that had a strong start, so you got into the habit of watching it every week, only to get 9 weeks in and think \"Why the fuck am I watching this, I haven't enjoyed it since episode 2\"? That's Goblin Slayer. \r\nI don't write many reviews so sorry if I keep this simple. But it's boring. I get it. The show is called Goblin Slayer. The guy is called Goblin Slayer. He, you guessed it, spends his time slaying goblins. The problem is that it doesn't work as a gimmick or whatever because it's so fucking boring. \r\nThe firstepisode was strong. I don't care about rape scenes or edge or whatever, as long as it adds to the story, which it did. The first episode took our preconceived notion that goblins are harmless trash mobs that drop 2 copper and 4 exp, and threw it right out the window. In this universe, they are a savage race of heartless monsters who individually pose little threat, but in groups can be an absolute nightmare. They are beasts that do not do battle with honor, and are more akin to an insect nest in need of extermination. We saw a group of young and peppy adventurers be raped and killed horribly for assuming the same thing we did. We saw this dude whose sole mission in life is to eradicate these vermin by any means necessary. He killed the children. He used fire, traps, subterfuge, and barbarism to wipe out this nest. It was a great setup for a dark fantasy series. \\n\\n\r\nAnd then it just kinda falls flat. There is no story. There is no meaningful character development. Every single episode is just 50% this dude killing goblins and 50% them talking about boring shit. They don't even make the goblin killing exciting,  every episode is basically a repeat of the last but somehow less and less engaging. I get that it's trying to stray from the typical \"chosen hero goes on a quest with his companions to defeat the demon lord\" thing in order to focus on the more unsung heroes of these fantasy settings, but perhaps the reason these tales aren't told is because they're just so completely boring. \\n\\n\r\nAnd that's to say nothing of our MC, Goblin Slayer himself. I don't know if I've ever seen a more boring and unlikable character in my many years of watching anime. He doesn't work as a main character because he has literally no personality. He has no traits apart from \"I kill Goblins. I love killing Goblins. Nothing matters to me apart from killing goblins.\" He hardly speaks, when he does it really feels like he's not even responding to what people say, rather than just saying a generic response that could be said in reply to almost anything like \"I see.\" or \"Is that so?\". And he doesn't even work as an edge-lord self insert because he's been given this very specific backstory and motive that literally nobody in the audience can relate to. \\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast are all far more interesting, but even then they're really just a slightly more vulgar take on typical fantasy party tropes. \\n\r\nThere's: \\n\r\n-The elven archer girl\\n\r\n-The big strong demihuman warrior male\\n\r\n-The dwarwan mage who likes to drink \\n\r\n-The innocent little priest in-training who is just trying her little heart out to be useful to the team\\n\r\nAnd the only real chemistry between them is elf girl and dwarf dude's banter, unless you count the fact that literally every girl in this series wants our MC's dick, because of course they do. \\n\\n\r\nIf it's any consolation, the art and designs are usually above average at the very least, apart from Goblin Slayers awful CG armor that randomly pops up now and then (to say nothing of his plot armor lol). \\n\\n\r\nThis ended up being longer than I expected but the long and short of it is that I found this show boring as fuck and am dropping it at episode 10. Even if something great and interesting happens to end the series/season, it doesn't change the fact that everything up until now was dogshit. \\n\\n\r\nAdios.",

            "content": "Goblin slayer has quickly become the anime communities most beloved yet at the same time most hated anime of the season, yet, even after watching all 4 episodes released, reading every available manga chapter (so far the anime has been pretty close to it), as well as the first and second volumes of the original Light Novel, I cannot help but think to myself that the show is neither as bad as the haters make it out to be, yet no where NEAR as good as the people who would give it a 8+ would have you believe.\r\nPlease, make no mistake, goblin slayer is BAD.It's not too well written, full of mind-numbing action, shock-factor murder and rape scenes, and it\u2019s pretty ugly to boot. Characters all look painfully generic, the action is poorly animated and not all to engaging, and if you make my mistake and watch this show right after seeing a show like the also-premiering Irozuku Sekai no Ashita kara - also known as The World in Colors - Goblin Slayer's background and foreground art make you want to gouge out your eyes with a hot iron.\\n\\n\r\nGoblin slayer takes heavy inspiration from rpgs and video games. adventures get ranks based on precious metals, they take on quests at a guild, hell, the characters even have classes that determine the roles in the party. Our starting party includes a Priestess, a Mage, a Martial Artist, and a Fighter who serves the role as the party tank. This is all pretty irrelevant however, as within 10 minutes they decide to take a quest to eradicate a goblin nest in a cave, and all get brutally murdered, or, in the case of one, raped by some goblins in a scene so hilariously over-the-top it makes you question if it was supposed to be even taken seriously. As the Priestess, our main female protagonist, is about to meet her untimely demise she gets saved by the titular Goblin Slayer (not before she wets herself mind you. Classy.) a stoic badass who's here TO SLAY SOME MOTHERF*CKING GOBLINS BITCH. YYYYYYYEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!\\n\\n\r\nWe then watch as Goblin Slayer man systemically kills all the goblins in the cave, wielding knowledge and expertise of someone who's been doing this for a while. This brings some questions to mind, that I can tell you as someone who reads ahead, never get addressed:\\n\\n\r\nHow did these kids go into this THIS unprepared? You mean to tell me there wasn't a single book or guide or person they could go and see or read to help them know what to expect? These people have lived in the world for 15~ years and have seriously never dealt with goblins before? The show would have you believe that goblins are CONSTANTLY threatening villages and the like, so SURELY these kids would have some knowledge of goblins BEFORE undertaking this mission right???? From the rest of the story onwards, everyone from old people, to other adventurers, to kids, all seem to understand that goblins kidnap and rape human women to reproduce, SO WHY ARE THESE PEOPLE SO SURPRISED?????\\n\\n\r\nThe entire draw of the show is the catharsis of watching those little green rapist shits getting their just desserts at the hand of the goblin slayer. That's it. If that appeals to you, go crazy my friend. The action isn't particularly well animated, usually involves just a lot of slashing, burning, and gore. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters include Goblin Slayer man, Goblin slayer's main chick Priestess-girl, Goblin Slayer's side chick Farmer-girl (who's personality squares solely in her large breasts), Guild-hostess girl, an elf, a dwarf, and a lizardman. To, you know, really complete that fantasy feel. Names? don't worry about em. Quality? don't worry about it\\n\\n\r\nAlthough perhaps thats a little unfair. I am giving it a 4 and not a 1 or 2 for a reason. For as much shit as I give it, it IS pretty entertaining watching Goblin Slayer man kill the goblins, even if they make for some pretty weak villains. \\n\\n\r\nThat's kind of what Goblin Slayer is all about. It's just mindless entertainment, giving the audience some kind of catharsis watching Goblins receive biblical justice. Gone are the days of interesting or morally gray villains like Griffith, Father, Emperor Charles, Meruem. Goblin slayer isn't saying anything, nor is it trying to. \\n\\n\r\nI'll be updating this review as the show finishes, but the contents will remain mostly the same.",

            "content": "Some very mature content, not for young audiences. \r\nGoblin Slayer is a masterpiece of satire. It is a subversion of everything one can come to expect out of the Isekai fantasy worlds that has become all too familiar. \r\nWhat we have in Goblin Slayer is really two worlds, the first is the \"typical world\", the same world the viewers have come to expect and that the rest of the characters in the show live. All the usual tropes of the genre are here; from the classic fighter, mage, archer, priest archetypes, to the guild hall with the smiling quest giver and progressive rankings for adventurers.You name it, it\u2019s got it. \\n\\n\r\nIn this world Goblins are low level cannon fodder meant to allow neophyte adventurers to gain experience as they one day move on to fighting dragons and demon kings. The other, the world of the Goblin Slayer; he alone sees the Goblins for who they are. The ever present danger, the small evils left unchecked that can ripple into the destruction of the world. Unlike the other heroes born with great powers and a manifest destiny to uphold, Goblin Slayer has no special powers. His combat prowess comes from years of dedication to his craft, the devotion of his being to this singular task. What his gift is then, is not of divine destiny, but vision. \\n\\n\r\nGoblin Slayer is great because it hits upon a subject rarely touched upon in the fantasy genre, the vigilance of the good required to keep evil at bay. It is rarely the great warrior that slays the dragon that keeps the lights on, the field tended, the people fed and the walls strong. But rather the nameless many who toils in the seemly mundane that keeps humanity moving forward. \\n\\n\r\nGoblin Slayer acknowledges the heroes who don\u2019t go from slaying goblins on their first day of adventure to slaying dragons two weeks later because of some prophesy foretold. It acknowledges the diligence, difficulty and creativity needed to fight the innocuous evil. The real struggle is not against bigger and badder foes as their power levels escalates to the ridiculous with the hero but the small but difficult tasks that reveal their challenge the more we confront them. Just as in our lives the true enemy is rarely the great injustices of our time. It is often not racism, misogyny, inequality or it\u2019s like that holds us back in life. But rather our own inability to clean our room, to go to the gym, to eat right, sleep right and do the right things.\\n\\n\r\nA particular scene in the show has the characters ponder the origin of the goblins. One of them tells of the story that parents would tell children, that \u201cwhen someone makes a mistake, a goblin is formed\u201d, ostensibly to keep children in line. But it holds perhaps the greatest truth in the Goblin Slayer world; that the evil of the Goblins come from us. They come from our pride, our fear, our ignorance, malice, envy and all the other foibles of man. The other adventurers might ridicule Goblin Slayer for his fixation on killing the lowly Goblins, but he alone understands that it is perhaps the most important quest of all.\\n\\n\\n\r\n9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nPros: Truly unique perspective and narrative arc that subverts convention\\n\\n\r\nCons: Incongruous tone at times",

            "content": "This anime was one that spurred quite the controversy.\r\nGoblin Slayer was hailed as a show for those with \"good taste\" by it's fanbase. Those who were \"sick and tired\" of \"boring\" slice of life garbage. This anime was \"special\" and \"different\" and do you know why that was? Simply because there was rape in the first episode. \r\nGoblin Slayer is edgy. And people often call this a buzzword because it is so popularly used and the meaning is loosely defined. Although what I would define it as is; trying to handle adult themes and ideas and failing due to the execution. Failing to be grimlymature. Goblin Slayer episode one champions this concept. Goblin Slayer struggles with it's adulthood. When you want to execute ideas and themes that deal with so much real world weight you need nuance or integrity. You have to earn handling these ideas. Using them for shock value is tasteless in concept and indicates the mark of a poor writer. It loses so much weight when you haven't earned your ability to pursue such grizzly concepts. Goblin Slayer is a failure as a seinen. \\n\\n\r\nSo how do you earn it? Comparatively this series can be rooted alongside Berserk as that's what even it's fans would show it with. So why are Goblin Slayers roots so rotten?\\n\r\nThere are a lot of aspects that are needed to make a good character. An essential element is their choices and morals. Their choices have to be logical, align with their own ideals, contribute to birthing those ideas, and be conceptually exciting in almost some way. Goblin Slayer has some of this but fails to be three dimensional in any way shape or form. As his choices are not difficult. He doesn't have a complex psychology (You can attach that to his trauma but I will return to that) \\n\\n\r\nIn the very first episode there is a hilariously nonsensical psychological question. This is posed by not on GS himself but is clearly a question for the audience to answer. It's a question of his own morality, how they align with yours, how they align with Priestess, and how they will impact him going further. This question is pivotal for both the establishment of his character, how he will change throughout the narrative, and the themes and tones this answer will impose. \\n\\n\r\nSo\\n\\n\r\nWhy is this salient question so stupidly effortless, uncomplicated, and ostentatious?\\n\r\nAll we have got from GS is he is a merciless hero so far and the although his passion is selfish and sadistic he never maintains the idea of being morally gray. His and the viewers complex psychological question was; do the monstrous, murderous, pillaging, raping, creatures with no semblance of conscience or conscious thought be killed while they're young. They are not humans. If they were perhaps child soldiers, it would create an actual mental conflict worthy of establishing him as a complex character with complex morals. Like if Goblins could be educated or peaceful, then his actions would have a rightful reason to stun the priestess. Then his actions would stun the viewer. Then he would trigger some form of complex response. Then there would be meaning to what this pretentious conflict holds. There's no weight to it. We are shown goblins are rapist, violent, disgusting, irredeemable monsters moments ago. This fails his most crucial moment of establishment and permanently hurts him as a character. \\n\\n\r\nGoblin Slayer as an anime doesn't earn it's adult edge. Using rape without having it tie somewhat to the narrative and world is substanceless and desperate while writing. It's a dark world so let's have some girls getting raped, that will show everyone how mature I am as an author. It's handled in a laughably poor way. This also has no bearing on the establishment of the world nor does this effect the narrative. \\n\r\nPriestess doesn't have any sort of complex arc about what these creatures are, (which  is what they would need if they wanted the goblin child killing to actually be smart rather than psuedointellectual) or what it's like to lose people because of incapability or irresponsibility. In fact Priestess and every other member of Goblin Slayers team are one dimensional, nothing characters. \\n\r\nAnd even worse, this first episode doesn't establish tone, stakes, themes, or setting at all. Yes there is gore but the idea that one mess up and your dead is thrown out the window as Goblin Slayer literally never is punished in a real way from what he does. He is simply boosted by the power of virginity (unforeshadowed btw) which is like the mystic water from Dragon Ball but even more retarded. \\n\\n\r\nIronically... it has just as much fanservice as any slice of life. From the moment you see Cow Girl as an adult, you see how truly ignorant the fan's claims were. Fanservice on it's own is a complex topic not worth discussing in this confined review but I'm mentioning it to simply show the utter contradiction of the fanbase. \\n\\n\r\nStory 1/10 - Doesn't keep the the established tone, poor plot points, contradictory message, no real substance or nuance.\\n\r\nThemes 1/10 - Not impressively handled as the cast doesn't make his redeeming traumatized heart feel authentic as they are so bland\\n\r\nArt 4/10 - Competent but uninspired direction, hideous CG with poor lighting applied\\n\r\nSound 3/10 -Nothing special, generic sound effects and cliche dramatic music\\n\r\nCharacter - Abysmal. None of the cast except GS is beyond a stagnant one dimensional character. With Goblin Slayers weak establishment, boring interections, lack of depth, and generic savantism, he comes off as a very bland character. \\n\r\nOverall 2/10\\n\r\nOne of the most overhyped anime of last year. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "So I think the best word to describe this anime is Pathetic. \r\n- Story :\r\nPretty much the same level of acting and script of a korean/american soap, or a porn movie. Nothing valuable, nothing to save. Unfortunately, it's worse when we are talking about animation. \r\nIt's trying very hard to be a good fantasy world; it got the eggs, the milk, the sugar, but no flour and after that I am the one who have to judge the quality of his cake.\r\n- Art :\r\nThe art is fair, or, at least, we are in 2018. The CGI is worthless, but other than that, nothing really tosay. No innovation, quite a shitty design, but it can become a good fan-service. \\n\\n\r\n- Sound :\\n\\n\r\nYou have the same old generic music that you can put in any situations, no matter the context, and other than that, this world doesn't live. The ambiance is empty like the dialogues. \\n\\n\r\n- Character :\\n\\n\r\nWith this level of story, it can be hard to give any charisma to any characters. And of course, they didn't succeed. \\n\\n\r\nYou have a cancerous main protagonist, following a cartoonish OP male dude with a revenge goal. It could have been nice to see him achieving his goal, but since he is just looking for a genocide, he is mostly Hitler for the goblins. \\n\\n\r\n- Enjoyment :\\n\\n\r\nI think some people can actually non-ironically appreciate this anime, so feel free to give it a try! You can even feel aroused if it's your style... or if you are fast. Anyway. x1\\n\\n\r\nBut honestly, if you are looking for a coherent and fun fantasy world, you have plenty of choice before this thing. \\n\\n\r\n- Last thought :\\n\\n\r\nI don't think I will continue to watch it. I wrote a review about Goblin slayer before this one and it was important for me to finish what I started. Now that I saw the minimum 4 episodes, I'm happy to say that I am done with this. \\n\\n\r\nI'm quite disappointed by the studio White Fox, they made a lot of interesting anime by the past ( not necessarily good, but interesting none of less, like Steins;Gate or Jormungand. ) Why is it different this time? Is it because Sony is behind this project? Is it because they are shit with this kind of universe? Or maybe it's because I'm getting old, I dunno, I can't tell. Anyway. x2",

            "content": "*No Spoiler Concise Review*\r\nTL;DR: D&D meets cringe-fest featuring your fav neighbourhood hero, Sir Goblin Slayer; protecting every potential rape victim by slaying one Goblin at a time. \r\n[Story: 4/10 , Characters: 2/10, Art: 4/10, Sound: 5/10, Enjoyment: 5/10]\r\nWhat is Goblin Slayer? What isn't Goblin Slayer. Do you like Goblins? Do you like slaying Goblins? Do you like plot? Lots and lots of plot? Even if they are tainted and viewers discretion is always advised? Even if you answered no for all, guess what, you are itching to still watch this show because you saw some vague trailer about a cool hero slaying goblins and youheard of the famous \"rape\" scene. You know you are intrigued and you just want validation to watch this cringefest. So I'll not waste your time, by giving you a brief overview of this show so you can finally get on with watching this anime. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime starts off well. Even though people lost their pants over the first episode because it was too \"edgy\" for them to handle, the premise was simple and straightforward. The man sees goblins. The man kills goblins. How can this show even progress? It can't. The story sort of continue for a bit then just crashed and burned as viewers had to sit through \"plot\" after \"plot\" instead of actual plot. Even the ending was infuriating. It tried to build it up by giving a small back-up side OVA as a recap to jog your memory but it still failed. Btw, when an anime can give a recap episode, 10 episodes in, you know just how much \"plot\" this anime contains. Regardless, if it's \"plot\" you are after, watch on. \\n\\n\r\nNow the characters on the other hand, aside from Goblin Slayer, everyone else just seems like your generic side characters. Most of the girls were introduced as different deres because later on they fight to be part of his \"harem.\" The other adventurers just blended in altogether. If Goblin Slayer's entourage didn't have physical characteristics as tails, pointy ears or being a dwarf, you wouldn't even know they exist. That's how generic all the characters were in this show. No purpose, no goals, just slaying goblins and drinking fire wine. \\n\\n\r\nAside from the \"plot\" and one dimensional characters, the art and animation, despite being CG from time to time, was not bad overall. Sure they made Goblin Slayer's fight sequences pretty badass but aside from that nothing stood out. The opening song and ending song was alright and in the beginning Goblin Slayer had a nice hard metal entrance song. However, that too faded with time as you get accustomed to it. Nothing stands out and that's the sad reality of this show. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I personally was hyped to watch this show. It's a fun show to watch with your buddies and just laugh about it. However, if you are watching it alone, then let's pray on the god of dice that you have a peaceful sleep. I would not re-watch this anime and I'm quite perplexed that this anime is even getting a second season. I guess \"plot\" and \"edge-factor\" can do wonders for a cringefest anime in this day and age. Let's give everyone a sequel. Anyways, give it a watch and tell me later how Goblin Slayer slayed goblins in your dreams. ;) \\n\\n\r\nP.S. Thank you for reading. I hope you found this short and supaishi review helpful!\\n",

            "content": "Goblin slayer isn't the best dark fantasy I have ever seen nor is it the worst. However to me personally I think it's an extremely beautifully lacking story. \r\nStory 10/10: I personally love the story. It's so simple and that's the beauty of it. I understand those people who say things like it has nothing going for it, it's boring, and the one I like, IT'S NOT DEEP. Simply we have Goblin slayer who was traumatized at birth about his sister being killed, toyed, raped, etc within such a close range of where he was hiding. As such being the idk maybe less then 12year old boy he was maybe caused him enough trauma to want revenge for what happened. So he spends the rest of his life so far killing nothing but goblins and thinking nothing of goblins. To me this is how he copes with the trauma which happened to him, this is how he tries to deal with the scar on his heart when his village and his sister were destroyed that day. To me that's the beauty of this simplistic story. Of course we could of had a series about the 3 heroes who we see occasionally who killed the demon lord or something and maybe people would of liked that more, however he may not have saved the world like those three heroes did, however to those people who he saved he saved their world. \\n\\n\r\nAlso another aspect of this show people might not have noticed or cared to much to pay attention to is how Goblin slayer slowly starts to get his emotions back. Caring, trusting, and learning to be more open with others. This is also a story of him getting over his trauma and starting to accept the present and not be so stuck up with the past. \\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation 7/10: People knock on the the CGI way to much. I really only noticed it when they have Goblin slayer walking and during talking scenes and such. Not that big of a deal. During the fighting scenes that don't use the CGI and the art during the battle scenes are actually really good. \\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10: The OST is decent I guess no real song stood out to me but the OP is one of my favorites this season and I listen to it a lot. If you not like \"engrish\" then you won't like it but I love the song paired with the OP animation. The ED is also good but not as good as the OP.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 7/10: Legit non of the other character beside Goblin slayer, guild girl, and the Sword Maiden did I actually really care for. Not that I didn't like them but they didn't really stand out to me. I explained why I liked goblin slayer when I talked about the story so I don't wanna talk about him again , I like guild girl for the way she acts, she's funny and a bit of a jack ass which I love. I also like the Sword Maiden because one she's hot and also for her backstory and what she went through. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10: To me the only thing lacking in this story is the character themselves. Which is why I can't bring the score higher in my review. Now do I think it's bad and anyone who doesn't like it have bad taste no. I can see how people don't like it and I don't blame them.  I do think this show handles trauma, depression and the like better then  NGE did but I only mention that because people who don't like this show 9/10 times have NGE in their favorites which is funny. Now I would like to have a discussion about this show with anyone who wants to. Feel free to do so.",

            "content": "It's not very good, but not because it has rape.\r\nGoblin Slayer is a \"dark\" medevial fantasy dungeon crawler. It's a homage to Dungeons and Dragons. Characters go on quests and kill goblins.  I put \"dark\" in quotes because it really falls off being dark past the infamous first rape episode and becomes more lighthearted. And boring.\r\nCharacters: Generic and shallow. Goblin Killer is basically a walking joke. Kill Goblins, that's his personality. It's a pretty funny gag at first when characters react with \"*exasperated sigh* all he cares about is killing Goblins..\" but this quickly becomes old when it happens with every line of GoblinSlayer's dialogue and is nearly the sole source of comedy. These kind of blank slate characters can be fine, but not when it's the main character. \\n\\n\r\nThe female protagonist is just as bland and uninteresting. She's generic anime female character with no personality other than mindless devotion to Goblin Slayer San. \\n\\n\r\nLizard man: boring. Dwarf and Elf: Legolas and Gimli ripoff but Legolas is a generic tsundere and Gimli isn't funny. The latter 3 feel like cartoon characters and are part of the tonal issues with this show. \\n\\n\r\nWorld building: There isn't any. We are given generic fantasy land. I keep forgetting it's not an Isekai, that's how generic this world is. You have elves, warriors, basically DND adventurer types that live in villages and go on quests. \\n\\n\r\nAn example of poor writing is how Goblins are considered \"low level quests\".  Goblins in this show are portrayed as extremely dangerous and sneaky, our introduction to them is them raping and killing a group of adventures. Adventurers go in on their first quest without any fear whatsoever. If Goblins really are so dangerous, word would spread about how much of a threat they are and they'd be made higher priority quests. The worst part of this is that the \"guild girl\" (quest giver) obviously knows they're all going to die and she doesn't even try to stop them besides a very weak \"maybe you shouldn't, it's not easy...\" Any sane person who has sent adventurers on quests and sees what happens would have firmly stopped them; the writing there is just laughable. This makes guild girl a detestable character but the show treats it like we're supposed to like her.\\n\\n\r\nThe whole notion of goblins being weak fodder enemies is a notion we the viewer gets from books, movies and video games that feature goblins as weaklings. In a world where they are not weakings and are a clear threat, this pre-concieved notion wouldn't arrise. \\n\\n\r\nTo further the problem of Goblins being \"low level\" quests: We see Goblin Slayer going on multiple quests. Obviously if the story was just Goblin Slayer killing little goblins, the story would get boring fast. So it turns out he encounters Super Goblins, basically giant Goblins that are considered platinum rank. Platinum rank is one of the high tiers of adventurers; Super Goblins (or Ogres) being around on low level missions (multiple times) makes it laughable that Goblins are still conisdered low level quests in this world. This paired with the aforementioned horrible quest giving excuse; it's all extremely contrived and poorly thought out. \\n\\n\r\nTone: The tone of this show is all over the place. Actually it starts out dark and shocking, with the rape scene. After that it turns into very generic comedy adventure isekai. They were trying to set the tone of this world with the first episode. The problem is that you can't just have one shocking thing happen, and then completely forget about it because what you just build up feels cheap and makes the show inconsistent. I have a hard time believing that rape happened in the first episode with how lighthearted things are in the later ones.\\n\\n\r\nStory: There is no story. It's just Goblin Slayer enters dungeon with cute anime girl, elf, ilzard man and dwarf, kill goblins. Rince and repeat for the first 10 episodes. Needless to say it is hardly thrilling or compelling, defiinitely not one that makes you excited to see the next episode.  Watch the first 2 - 3 episodes. See how it goes from shock to shallow world building; and is already resorting to big tittie cowgirls to try to keep you interested. \\n\\n\r\nAction: The action and animation is dull. Nothing interesting happens. Goblin slayer often cleaves goblins in half with his sword... that's about it. There's no emotion behind the fight scenes because all of the enemies are just orcs and goblins with no personality behind \"GRRR IM EVIL\". If you compare a good show like Fullmetal Alchemist, every battle in that show wasn't just a battle, it was a dialogue between two opposing sides. That made it interesting. A battle doesn't need a dialogue back and forth but if there's no tension or good action to it - the goblins rarely put up a fight and we all know girl and Goblin Slayer aren't going to die - it's just a bore. \\n\\n\r\nArt: It's crap. It gets the job done, nothing special about it. Lots of cute girls. Talking heads. Very basic action. Not much to say about it. Character designs and scenes are all very dull looking and generic. Same goes for the sound.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: It's a bore because there's nothing to get invested in. The characters are flat and boring, the world building is laughably shoddy, and the story is non existent.\\n\\n\r\nI imagine Goblin Slayer was written by someone who likes anime and wanted to make something edgy and cool but didn't really know what they were doing so they stuck in a bunch of anime tropes that they liked without understanding how those things worked.  What we got is a mess of different tropes thrown together haphazardly without any substance or depth.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I give Goblin Slayer a 3/10. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for the read. Let me know if there are typos. Goblin Slayer was a super disappointment to me as someone who loves edgy and dark shows. Have a great day.",

            "content": "As with all my reviews, this is SPOILER FREE. Don't listen to other idiots, there is no such thing as a \"minor spoiler\" in my eyes.\r\nGoblin Slayer (GS from now on) has been the show that I've changed opinion on most this season. After watching episode 9 last night, I came to realize that it's my favorite this season. Here's why:\r\nStory: 8/10. The story is interesting. There's a massive war going on with a Big Bad somewhere in the world, but we aren't a part of it. GS is like being a side quest. Occasionally you hear about progress being made in the war throughconversations, but GS isn't about that. I think it's an interesting approach to world-building not seen anywhere else I know of. The characters' motivations are clear. For Goblin Slayer, it's to kill goblins. For the others, it's to have adventures and kick ass. Simple, which is nice. Some small parts of the story become quite confusing and complex but in general it's a simple story.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10. This may be contentious. Let me explain. GS himself is always CGI if he's in armor. I think it was a good choice. He doesn't pop in and out of CGI which can be quite disruptive. The other characters are designed well, it's very easy to distinguish them from each other. They have some cool complexity to their designs. Expect lots of fan service though. Some people say the animation isn't great but frankly I haven't noticed any explicit parts where it's just bad. And it's good when it matters most.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10. It's good. The OP is awesome, definitely my favorite in recent history. VAs seem good from what I can tell in the sub.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10. The show makes an excellent choice here. It keeps the main cast to five characters who are always present. Rather than having different ones filter in and out, it can focus on these five. They each have distinct personalities that interact and clash with each other's. It's good for both comedy and drama. There are minor characters who recur, but the main 5 are the ones you'll be focusing on. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10. Like I said, this show surprised me. I thought it would be all shock and awe with no depth, and would eventually get boring. While there was a bit of a mid-season drag that slowed the pacing, it was ultimately for the best by making the next arc that much more exciting. The world and the characters have a decent amount of depth for how simple their motivations are and the fact that they're basically a side-narrative, but these are both plusses in my eyes. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10. If the story picks up a bit, I think this show could be a masterpiece. As it stands, it's already outstanding and definitely deserves your attention for at least 6 episodes. I suggest giving it a shot.",

            "content": "For a series that starts off so dark, with gore, death and rape all in the first episode, Goblin Slayer feels like a big bunch of fluff. The characters are underdeveloped, the series is full of generic fantasy tropes, and none of this in a good way.\r\nWhere is the dark world of goblin slaying that was promised? If you were hooked from the first episode on a show that promised to be more than just another fantasy romp, then that's really a shame because you're probably not getting what you signed on for. At some point the shock of the initial episode fades away, andwe're left with...not a whole lot. We have in our party: a flat main character with a generic backstory albeit in very cool armor, the couple of girls that will stick by his side no matter what, and a trio that embodies all the classic adventuring anime stereotypes you could ever ask for. \\n\\n\r\nAll this would be completely fine if Goblin Slayer stuck with its premise of an intense and brutal world killing goblins, but as the episodes drag on that's not at all what we get. The shock and surprise that the series starts out with never really come back in later episodes, and that's what makes this feel a bit cheap. Goblin Slayer promised to be different with a gruesome first episode, and then quickly backtracked, making sure that every bit of the show seems as generic as possible.\\n\\n\r\nThe one interesting point is that unlike many isekai or fantasy anime, Goblin Slayer seems to draw much more of its inspiration from western fantasy culture, with a lot of elements from games like Dungeons and Dragons being added in. It's cool, but just not enough to distinguish the show from anything else you could watch.\\n\\n\r\nGoblin Slayer is disappointing, not because it has violence and rape, but because it uses these as the anime equivalent of clickbait. It draws you in promising to be different, a dark take on fantasy, but ends up giving you the exact opposite, pandering with every generic trope there is. For a show and premise that started off so unique and daring, its degraded down to none of that, and that's a real shame.",

            "content": "Goblin slayer is an anime so cliched that most of its characters don't have a name. Not that giving these elegantly crafted robot people a name would make much of a fucking difference considering every one of them is about as memorable as a yeast infection and twice as unappealing as that experience. But I suppose I should move back to my original claim about goblin slayer being cliched before I start this shitty review properly.\r\nThe protagonist aka goblin slayer aka the motherfucker who better die at the end of the series. Is a bruting cold-hearted anti-hero looking man with a tragic backstory that causeshim to demand violence against those who wronged him. And only gains any semblance of personality after he meets a cute imprisonable teen girl. (Aka every fucking popular semi-dark story in recent years The last of us, the walking dead games, Shadow of war, god of war, tales of berseria,  ect) Who you will grow attached to not because she's a well-written character but because she's adorable. Goblin slayer later gains a rag-tag band of misfits who slowly break down the bubble he's put himself in and if that doesn't sound fucking familiar to you at all then I give up and will move on to my next point.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEverything about goblin slayer and his party is either cliched or boring. His story is painfully overdone, his arc is nothing new, his voice sounds like a man struggling to find any interest in anything even killing goblins < Which might have been intentional but that only serves to make him even more boring. And he rarely talks about or does anything that isn't related to goblins. Never does he crack a joke he's stoic 100% of the time like the author attempted to make a character with depth and ended up giving everyone one trait to carry them through the show. \\n\\n\r\nYou got the smug elf\\n\\n\r\nYou got the wise dwarf\\n\\n\r\nThe lizardman: You got the annoying as fuck lizard man\\n\\n\r\nAnd you got the innocent healer.\\n\\n\r\nThis is fantasy party generator 101 people.\\n\\n\\n\r\nBut enough about goblin slayers countless generic attributes lets move onto the episode to episode blandness of everything.\\n\\n\r\nGoblin slayer follows a sort of monster of the week plotline each quest involves slaying goblins so there's no verity and the use of clever tactics exceedingly rare. And though the creator comes up with unique settings for each goblin encounter it mainly boils down to a very mmo esk go here and kill the things episodes. Which is fine for a video game not so much for an anime trying to hold your attention.\\n\\n\r\n Now you may ask \"But iorn you like the shadow of moredore games and have dozens of hours on both and goblin slayer is more or less just like that\" And while this is true the orcs have something the goblins don't and that's personality and structure to their society to make them a believable and complex threat. The goblins never feel like a threat and because of that, the conflicts with them have no real weight everything leaves you with a feeling of \"This was pointless\" rather than the sensation that something was accomplished.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nBut the biggest problem in goblin slayer is how the goblins themselves are viewed by society as a whole despite them somehow being competent enough to take down entire villages. No race with a habit of destruction on such a large scale would be ignored by the military of any nation. This leads the world goblin slayer lives in to be a bit unbelievable and unrealistic on top of the episode to episode formula.\\n\\n\r\nNow what do you get if when you don't have depth have, shock for no reason other than to shock the viewer, ending with cookie cutter characters? Well my friend you get an edgy anime. Good god this review might be one of my worsts. But this might be one of the worst animes I've seen all year so it balances out.",

It's definitely not on the shitty level that berserk (2016-2017) was! The sound is great all round, the OP and ED fits the show but what really stands out is the voice acting which in my opinion as it's some of the best this season. (The OST is solid also.)\r\nCharacter/Plot:\r\nThere isn't really much story so far, however the backstories and hinted things that have occurredhave been intriguing enough where it strengthens the overall plot. But in all honesty, the plot so far hasn't been great but rather just slaying goblins hence the fucking title (surprising right?) Every character has been great and likeable in my opinion even the horny little green shits this anime calls goblins but yet again there has been minimal development for now besides the MC. The MC so far is a basic badass with a tragic backstory but hey, I'm not complaining!\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nIt's a solid dark fantasy, it's not quite on par with its manga from what I've heard but so far it's definitely been enjoyable! I expect it to only get better from here and I'm not worried due to it being adapted by White Fox studios. Just a little notice; don't be a bitch about the rape and goriness in the anime, just don't watch the show if that disturbs you! I actually think these darker themes help to showcase the setting hence it being a \"dark fantasy.\" Yeah, I'm edgy as fuck...",

            "content": "So, this is the talk of the town eh? This is what shook the anime community by storm after countless and countless of Twitter bitching from libtards snowflakes SJWs, does it live up to the hype of its popularity from the  polarizing fanbase? We'll see...      ***SOME SPOILERS AHEAD***\r\n         The most controversial anime of the Fall season 2018 has hit the Crunchyroll statistics as the most viewed anime in the United States (link will be at the end of review). Before I \"complain\" about the review, I like to prefaceabout the \"dreadful\", gratuitous rape. As an art form, there is nothing inherently wrong in depicting distressful topics as long they evoke the core message....that rape is horrific and does happen to the very unfortunate sadly. It is thanks to the outcry of the intolerable butthurt snowflakes over any social media that Goblin Slayer became popular as it is because of them. So yes, thank you Twitter tards, you inadvertently made the thing you hate into something bigger. Seriously, Perfect Blue, Kara no Kyoukai 3, Berserk of course, and older 90s OVAs like Wicked City has rape scenes before Goblin Slayer and it only deserves such backlash because of it? What is even going on anymore? Oh, i guess is, \"Duh rApE iS bAd aNd MaI fEeLiNgS aRe HuRt\". I gonna quote Digibro on this too, \"The rape isn't that good\". WOW. I don't blame Kumo Kagyu, the author of GS, for this. It's his right to write whatever he wants and it's OK to criticize him for that but don't go on a tangent about a specific work is inherently bad because it contains a subject, you're uncomfortable with. Rant done, I will discuss the contents of the anime only, not the manga or the light novel even though the anime adapts mostly from the manga only.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n      Goblin Slayer is what the title states: It's about Goblin Slayer slaying goblins in all glorious rampaging fashion. Nothing more nothing less. The plot is essentially a stoic badass (who's probably an autistic badass) finding goblins and murder the living crap out them using badass tactics and strategies. The first initial impression the audience notice right away was its similarities to Berserk as it falls into the category of \"DARK FANTASY\" and its setting taking inspiration to the tabletop game, Dungeons and Dragons. Honestly, the comparative evaluation between Berserk and Goblin Slayer is off because the tonal inconsistency Goblin Slayer shifts from Episode 1 to the second. Here's what I mean. The second episode starts into introducing \"Cow Girl\", full on butt naked and stretching out in a sexual suggestive pose. Yep, dark and serious alright. The tone is so inconsistent, it doesn't know when things should calm down. I understand it was supposed to break away from the chaos and brutal action but why does it start off like that? Yes, Berserk does have comedy elements in its earlier chapters, but it never felt off since Puck was never a comic relief character to begin with (until the later arcs).  It gives a pretense to the audience that what they're watching not stay in a serious tone. And to make it worse, her boob jiggles in the next shot with her \"milk\" fall flat on the window sill.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n       However, that's not the major issue but rather the plot structure and its contents. Goblin Slayer himself is supposed to be a man who always prepare himself when things go south but when looking at a deeper inspection, he's essentially reading things off from the script. Take the episode where they indulge in the sewers with the canary. How does he know there's poison gas in the sewers? First off, there's no indication that there is one. Was there a map that said there were poison traps? Did he get that information from an architect who built the sewer? And as we thought, the poison gas was there just as Goblin Slayer predicted. Another instance of plot inconsistency was the second episode when GS and the Priestess are burning the nest of the rape victims. I guess he forgot he saved them because he burns the victims alongside with the goblins? Why? Because plot of course. There's also instance of plot armor galore. Take the episode where the crew almost gets annihilated as GS lays there unconscious with massive blood loss and possible concussion. How did he survive? A past memory of his mentor and his red eye glows....and it instantly gives him Slayer Rage mode? If that's not a perfect case of Deus Ex Machina, I don't know what is. Even in another episode, the poison in GS almost seemingly to kill off GS but no, for some weird reason, they placed him in a situation where they need to heal GS through the ritual of virgin's resurrection by lying next to them nude. Wait, they could've done that with the sorceress in the first episode. why explain this now? If that were the case, they could've saved her while she was still alive? Nope, it's all tension and drama. So many plot conveniences, it's almost if GS is overpowered.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n       But the plot wouldn't be important without its central characters, right? Wait what characters? You mean those empty walking ranks and class titles? I can understand the point of having no names is to give an impression the world around them isn't all sunshine and rainbows and anyone can be brutally murdered as if they are nothing significant as expendable. But, the characters of Goblin Slayer are the written terribly and there's no semblance of interesting personalities nor there is any semblance of motivation except Goblin Slayer, who just want to slay Goblins because the name said so. Tell me, what's the actual reason the Priestess wants to adventure? Just to adventure? What about the High Elf, Dwarf, and Lizardman? What's their aspirations other than getting GS to join them into saving the world? If the answer is no, you would be correct. There are just there for the sake of the plot. Not to mention, their personalities are just as any anime tropes that is just as annoying they can ever be. Priestess is just a cute waifu and saying, \"Goblin Slayer-san\" almost indefinitely, High Elf is selfish always saying \"eh?!!!!!\" like some type of tsundere even though she's not one but she definitely does act like one. Even the dwarf thinks she's selfish, \"your chest is as flat as your heart is small\". Jeez that's accurate to Elf's character in all honesty. Cow Girl is your typical childhood friend sprinkled in with a hot body and C L E A V A G E. Did I mention she's a childhood friend? Guild Girl is somewhat likable but slightly ruined when it appears that she has a crush on him. Oh wow, that completes our Holy Trinity of generic harem sub plot. The Sword Maiden herself characterization is so blatantly bad, its honestly saddening. The way they present her \"tragic\" backstory through exposition while zooming the camera in to her breast takes out all the mature factor out the window. Even the way she dresses screams fan service. Speaking of dresses, some of the female characters either have cleavage out in the open, have thigh highs, or just dresses in a sexually suggestive manner like cosplayers. Talk about dark and serious. The side characters are honestly forgettable or worse, empty. If a character who resembles Lancer from the Fate series, even having the same demeanor or attitude, the character is not being handled well. And the other side characters are such egotistical assholes. They mock GS for being passionate of killing Goblins but when GS asked them for help in the last 2 episodes and defeated a Goblin Lord, they suddenly take a liking to him. Why? Not only that, they're entranced by his handsome looks as he takes off his helmet. Wow, talk about favoritism. I won't speak much about the goblins since they were merely cannon fodder of that world they inhabit and for GS to slay the living hell out of them. Yes, the context is there of why they rape women but they're still cartoon levels of evil because of it. Not saying there should be \"GOOD GOBLINS\" but it's pretty poor in terms of characterization. The worst character treatment I can think of is the man as the title stated. He is boring, downright boring. In what way does he resonate with the audience? To be a stoic badass. His dialogue is consisting of \"I see\" or \"Do this\" or just spurt out the whole plot so we can make the audience feel like they're paying attention or better yet,\"GOBLINS\". The writer gave much time on his motives but not his personality. I get that his past was traumatizing enough to the point of him being a silent raging autist and I'm using comparisons here again, at least Guts is lovable due to his well-written characterization compare to an empty raging man with a Goblin hate boner. There's nothing about GS with a single likable trait other than being a badass for the audience to give to project as a power fantasy. I was more interested in his CG model than his entire character \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n       Oh yes, the CG. It's noticeable. It's very jarring when he's in a scene with 2D models. Even at broad daylight, it's noticeably bad from the janky movements and animations with low frame rates. The art is serviceable, but it looks like it belongs in a comedy harem anime rather than a dark fantasy people claim it to be. Sure, let's have many waifus as we want in our dark fantasy setting.  It is honestly like any high fantasy setting except when there's blood, gore, and rape, the setting becomes dark when it wants to. The studio behind this is White Fox whose series of works like ReZero and Akame ga Kill; both of which I find abhorrent in my opinion. Their animation quality isn't as visually appealing to the likes of Studio Bones, Trigger, or Gainax but they did a serviceable job at best. The soundtrack isn't memorable as well. The opening song \"Rightfully\" by Mili does correlate to the show and has a grim tone to it. As for the ending, sounds like any shounen ending, nothing too special. Animation is ok, you have your average panning/tilting shots when there are still images and basic walking animations. Fight sequences looked ok, but they do sell on the impact of the killings, especially on larger foes like the ogre or goblin champion. Again, it is ok. And one thing I like to mention, the canary scene at the end is supposed to be the credits, there's no symbolic meaning behind it. If so, it is pretentious as it can get.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n       I spoke of nothing but negatives because I couldn't think of something I can simply enjoy or find meaningful things of what the anime wants to convey other than \"rape is bad\". I guess it is nothing more than just mindless gore schlock that people like for some reason because it is comparable to Berserk and Dungeons and Dragons. But that's the thing, it has no identity because it's easy to compare the contents of Berserk to this pile of mess. The comparative evaluation between the two anime I mentioned previously are different in a whole different level. Berserk is dark fantasy and uses the genre with care of its world, characters, and even philosophy that plays heavily in the themes of Berserk. Goblin Slayer is just pure power fantasy. It uses its setting as a writing tool to fool the audience what they're expecting and writes whatever they want along the way. The rape scene in the first episode is a good example. Although the content is distressing and we all know rape is inherently bad by nature, it takes the subject material right off the bat and never mentioned again until it is necessary for the narrative. One of the examples I mentioned was the Sword Maiden's backstory; For a hero who slain the Demon Lord but was brutally raped by goblins since childhood, the way they presented her is overly sexual as the camera zoomed in her breast for gratuitous reasons almost like \"fan service\". It's really making the audience's intelligence feel insulted and lessens the credibility of the anime's \"darker tone\". The characters are one dimensional, the story has inconsistencies in moving the plot forward, the subject material isn't handled with care or nuanced, it is false expectations from what was established in the very beginning and uses it as an advantage to make the anime seem more than what meets the eye. Goblin Slayer is its own pedestal of bad but not as bad as Sword Art Online because its objectively bad.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n       It looks like I'm on a tangent here so I must close this off on a good note; I do not wish to encourage any quarrels against anyone who may like this kind of content, it's perfectly fine. This review is meant to analyze the massive flaws Goblin Slayer stand as its own anime, not an imitation or an inspiration of previous franchises. For those who are sensitive to this kind of subject material, are free to ignore the existence of Goblin Slayer. Don't be like the people on Twitter ranting with their moral superiority about what needs to be shown or not shown in entertainment media (and the AniTubers who wants to throw in politics in this, you probably know who I'm talking about). Any subject material whether it is taboo or not, should be expressed because that's the beauty of art. I don't think Kumo Kagyu really cares about Western audiences' perspective, he just wants to write what he likes even though that work may be a piece of flop. In the end, you are not a bad person for watching Goblin Slayer. If Goblin Slayer fits that criteria of your taste, it is up to you. If not, stay clear away from this. Just watch whatever you want to watch dude/gals. As for me, I feel quality in anime has decreased and Goblin Slayer is one of those examples.  The abridged version of Goblin Slayer is well written than the original and that's a bold claim to make coming from me. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Rating: 2/10 Horrible \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n(Here's the link to the statistics=https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-feature/2018/11/05-1/crunchyrolls-most-popular-fall-2018-anime-by-state-province-country)",

I hate this show with a passion and I can\u2019t believe that it became this popular \r\nGoblin slayer is an empty shell, his character is nothing, he answers all with a short word or sound, and literally doesn\u2019t have anything to his character, all he is, is the vessel with which you caninsert yourself into this story, a character that you can pretend is yourself, a badass that can\u2019t be stopped that all the girls love. (Literally all of them) other characters don\u2019t have much more to offer to the show, other than awkward, boring dialogue. Priestess, is just a typical Loli, she\u2019s there just to be scared by goblins and piss herself every once in a while. Archer, she\u2019s an elf, she\u2019s an archer, Tsundere, the other characters I don\u2019t really care about, they left such a small impression on me that there are several characters who\u2019s entire personality revolves around goblin slayer(and the lizard is just an embarrassing character)\\n\\n\r\nThere are lots of shows with boring unoriginal characters sure, but real the reason why this show is a cut below the rest is because much of this show is just soft core hentai. That\u2019s all it is, these characters are so sexualized that I know we\u2019re meant to enjoy watching them be raped, and that\u2019s all goblins do, that\u2019s there purpose in this show, almost entirely. There are other shows and manga that have a heavy rape focus that are so much better and have it actually have a purpose, berserk for example, I remember one page of the manga that left an impression on me, a woman is helping the band of the hawk, she tells them that she still looks up to them even after they were declared traitors and her little brother embarrasses her by mentioning that she got dressed up to meet them, a few pages later she\u2019s being raped by a demon with the burnt corpse of her brother right beside her. This scene with likeable characters being butchered is so much more hard hitting then scenes that are almost copy pasted in this show.\\n\\n\r\nThis show fails in in every way possible, as a berserk clone, as a dark fantasy anime, even as good hentia. This show should only appeal to edgy preteens that have barely developed there own opinions. It\u2019s terrible, nothing about it is original, and one of the worst anime I\u2019ve seen in a long time",

            "content": "Ah yes, Goblin Slayer. If CrunchyRoll didn't messed up with it's motion picture content rating when the show aired it's first episode and the internet didn't went full crazy about controversy about a scene in the first episode, I would not have watched this show what-so-ever. But since I like controversy I picked up this show and within the first episode alone I already knew this anime is just one of those shows I really should not waste my time on, but I did anyway. So where do I even start about this hot piece of garbage?\r\nStory: 2/10 (Horrible)\r\nThe story is pretty straightforward. It's abouta guy that slays goblins as the title suggests. To be honest, there's not really much going on with the plot in this anime. Even as a Slice of Life this anime would have failed and I can consider myself as a Slice of Life-fan. This show really doesn't know what it wants to be. Is it a Slice of Life? Or is it an Action anime show? I get why this show is called Goblin Slayer as it would get explained later on what's Goblin Slayer's motive to slay only goblins though. But it's rather dissapointing to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 2/10 (Horrible)\\n\r\nThe art-style, let me reprase that, the CGI is insanely choppy & horrible as well. Even for walking they have to use bad CGI. It still feels lazy in this day and age to use CGI in anime. Sure, when CGI was starting to become a thing in anime, it was revolutionairy for sure, but it was still bad. In this show they were even that lazy to use our own very moon and gave this world the same moon, but just one a bit bigger than the other one plus in another color, but still it's our own very moon. Lazy! If you're going to design a world where you have two moons, atleast do a little more effort and design two different moons. It's not that hard to understand that. Thanks!\\n\\n\r\nSound: 3/10 (Very Bad)\\n\r\nThe voice acting in this shows feels like most voice actors don't even care about this show iether. The only thing I do like a bit more compaired with all the other things is the the opening song. Yeah, I have to admit I like the opening song. But that's it soundwise.\\n\\n\r\nCharather: 2/10 (Horrible)\\n\r\nThat brings me to the characters. They're all boring. Goblin Slayer being the main charather is also the most boring one of the bunch. You also can tell he's not really the brightest tool of the shed iether. He literally eats and drinks through a helmet visor. I don't know if I've ever seen a more boring and unlikable character in my many years of watching anime. He doesn't work as a main character because he has literally no personality. Even a house plant shines out more life than this charather does. He has no traits apart from \"I kill Goblins. I love killing Goblins. Nothing matters to me apart from killing goblins.\" He hardly speaks, when he does it really feels like he's not even responding to what people say, rather than just saying a generic response that could be said in reply to almost anything like \"I see.\" or \"Is that so?\". Then you have our main girl that didn't learned to go to the toilet first before you go on an adventure because she even peed twice in fear, the flatchested elf girl that's thousands of years old that still acts rather like a five-year-old and a dwarf that likes alcohol *suprise suprise*. The least boring charather to me of this show is the bipedal Lizardman \"Tokage Souryo\" because he loves cheese and praises famous dinosaur genera like Velociraptor, Brontosaurus (yes, the genus Brontosaurus is finally again a valid genera) & Iguanodon.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1/10 (Appailing)\\n\r\nNo, I did not enjoyed this hot piece of garbage. If I even can get annoyed by the fact whoever did the subtitles of lacking captital letters where they should be used it's a good sign I did not enjoy this hot garbage at all and I really don't get all the fuss about this show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2/10 (Horrible)\\n\r\nIf CrunchyRoll did not made an oopsie and people didn't overreacted over the internet, I would not have seen this anime at all. There are tons better anime out there. Take my personal advice and skip this anime. It's not worth your time in my opinion. Overall score 2 out of 10.",

            "content": "Goblin Slayer is mediocre in every way, shape, and form.  The only notable thing about it is its depiction of rape, which, surprise surprise, is the only thing anyone ever talks about.  I personally couldnt give a shits less about it, so that is the last time I will mention it in this review.\r\nOn the surface, I like the idea of this show a lot.  Taking a typically weak monster, and boosting it up to be the main antagonist of the show is a really neat concept.  It gives a lot of interesting realism to a fantasy story.  Sure, itsjust one child sized goblin with a rusty knife, but that wont make getting stabbed any less painful.  If done better, I think it could be really interesting.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, in order to make this concession work, so much has to be waved away.  Why is Goblin Slayer the only dude who knows how dangerous they are?  Why does no one seem take issue with all of the stolen girls?  Why do other adventures, who seem to be scarred the same way our MC is, not seem to care anymore?  Where is the military in all this?  They mention it multiple times but the stories reason is \"oh theyre just goblins\".  No fucking way would anyone take that position in this universe, given how truly evil the goblins are.  This is my main complaint with the show.  The concept is good, but the execution raises more questions than it deserves.\\n\\n\r\nAll of this might be forgivable had anything else in the show been able to carry it.  Every one of the characters, save for the sword maiden and maybe the priestess, is boring and one note.  I dont know what it is about fantasy anime having boring protagonists, but Goblin Slayer sure is a snooze fest.  The \"quirk\" that he only repeats the same three things is funny once, but again, the concessions needed to have him be like that completely obliterates any intriguing dialogue for the whole show.  It can even be harmful like with the sword priestess where the audience didnt know what the fuck was going on since he cant have a normal conversation.  The side cast is just as one dimensional.  Elf is a tsundere, lizardman likes cheese, dwarf likes alcohol, cowgirl likes GS, guild girl likes GS, the adventurers like... adventuring.  Thats it.  \\n\\n\r\nThe visuals are whatever.  Half of the time, GS is 3D and it looks like garbage.  Some of the action is pretty sweet, but the rest sucks.  I wont comment on the rest, like sound, music, backgrounds, etc, since I just dont remember any of it.  Guess thats all I really need to say, huh?\\n\\n\r\nTo end, Ill list what I liked.  The DnD backdrop is cool, and it lends itself to the theme really well.  Like previously mentioned, some of the action is good.  The strategy that Goblin Slayer uses to slay goblins is usually fun.  The OP is alright.  Goblin Slayers red eye is rad as hell.  Guess thats about it.  \\n\\n",

Goblin Slayer is underrated and here is WHY!\r\nRight off the bat we start with a strong opening episode that tells us \"this is no lighthearted adventure and all bad stuff happens\". It's not a matter of being edgy, it's a matter of telling a story the right way! The dude has trauma, well justified trauma, nothing is wrong with the main character and side characters as far as I can see. If you want to be so picky about everything here then you might as well become a housemaid for allI care.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself manages to do a great job at building suspense, expectations as well as subverting those expectations. It actually includes character development along with a little bit of world building that's done well. Or well enough for my standards (which are rather high (please ignore my current top scores, they are long since incorrect)). Also, the pacing is on point, so that's that.\\n\\n\r\nVoice actors and actresses did a magnificent job. Not only do the voices represent characters well, they also match their looks for the most part. I guess that's what you would expect from studio with a good reputation. The animation is mostly on point excluding some out of place looking CG armor, but it blends in well enough to not distract your from watching. Sound design is also nice, it doesn't feel artificial at all.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR In short it's a really well done anime that manages to drag you into the world and feel sympathy for the characters despite being so dark and somewhat cheerful at the same time. You could describe it as life honestly.",

As that is said, i fucking love Goblin slayer.\r\nStory: Seems like a pretty generic fantasy story at first, but it quickly turns its head around to go on a really dark story with dark subjects. With this in mind, it's not like its worth an oscar, its not the first time we have seen animes do this, but its still pretty uncommon and feels fresh.\r\nArt: The use of CGI for the main character in some scenes isdebatable, but the actions scenes do look really nice with a lot of gore. Not the best by any mean in therms of animations, but its okay. The desing of the supporting cast is pretty generic but the goblin slayer himself elevates that score by 2 for being another anti hero (like saitama being bald)\\n\\n\r\nSound: The Op is calm and sad yet very exiting. Plus its in english making it really stand out from anything else. The background music is pretty average but as soon as the action starts, the rock music reminecent of doom kicks in, nice touch.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Again, if you dont like dark themes, you wont like it, but i do, so i enjoyed this anime a LOT\\n\\n\r\nOverall: best anime of 2018 for me",

The reason why they can live their happy lives with their families and friends is that somewhere far away from them, cute little goblin babies are being brutally killed by some armored dude who doesn't like little green people. \r\n  If you like a little bit of gore in your anime, Goblin Slayer is for you. The story's progression is a bit slow, and the sequencing of events in the anime are scrambled when compared tothe source material, which may hinder plot development later on. This doesn't decrease the overall quality of the anime as it most likely won't cover all the source material and is not as plot driven as other anime's are. The story gets a 7/10.\\n\\n\r\n  For Art and Sound, 10/10 . The music is great, and the animation is smooth and detailed. The art really stands when goblin slayer gets mad. For Character and enjoyment , 10/10 and 9/10 respectively. The mc is unique, doesn't resemble any other mc which gives a refreshing feeling to the anime. Side characters have yet to be developed but till now they all seem like successful attempt to be unique, and they can get quite funny too! Enjoyment is subjective and I gave it a 9/10 because of the gore, the fight scenes/art, the unique mc, and the music.\\n\\n\r\n  Overall solid 9/10 would recommend!\\n\\n",

            "content": "A classic type of RPG hack and slash like the good old days, except on hard mode. It gets gruesome so don't let the mellow cover picture trick you into thinking this is kid friendly. If I had to say something bad about this show it would be the generic story. Yet again we find ourselves against familiar foes with age old reasons to go on an adventure. You've probably heard this story a million times, but if you can forgive that one flaw there might be something special underneath. The lines are so far nothing special, with humor that falls flat and overly mellowpersonalities that make it difficult to make the case for \"best character\" in here. Characters range from lacking to solid, but nothing amazing has come up just yet. If I had to say something good about this show it would be the pacing. An unexpected introduction gives way for a quality paced adventure that takes it's time with each person they run into, it might remind you of how many similar shows these days get it totally wrong. Side characters often feel like a part of the main story and it's not rare to see familiar faces. This gives it the feel of a cast the show cares about. The daily depiction of ordinary, everyday routines adds depth and immersion, making you feel like you're with them along for the adventure. The soundtrack is very moody, swinging from mellow and gentle, to chaotically invigorating, giving action scenes a lot of flavor. Animation has it's up and it's downs: action animation has a nice touch, with a unique style it can call it's own. outside of battles the show can be a bit too stiff, like a plain old comic with little life. Unique camera angles add some emotion and perspective to situations that are dry. \\n\r\nOverall it's a multi-class RPG like a retro game, but with a slow and steady approach that rewards loyal fans with great moments. Like a cardboard house, the flaws are very noticeable, but that doesn't mean it's not fun. I give it a 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nPSA: may not be suitable for younger audiences, it gets as violent as possible\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR Version: Slow and steady RPG adventure that's rough around the edges. Has it's flaws but also has considerable depth and will become addictively immersive.",

            "content": "\"Goblins aren't smart creatures, but they aren't dumb creatures either. This is a common mistake to beginners, since they think too lowly of this creature, and soon enough they all got killed by the creature they think lowly off.\" \r\n- The Goblin Slayer\r\nSo i've read the manga beforehand and known the story and arcs as of the present time. However i have to express my gratefulness towards White Fox to make Goblin Slayer into an anime. Because i've been looking forward to seeing the manga turned into an anime.\r\nFor starters i have to say this anime is intended to be 18+ or 21 for somecountries. The anime portrays a lot of scenes from the manga which included a lot of gorey and dark imagery and i'm quite surprised that White Fox pushed the F-cked up imagery and shown some explicit scenes even though it's for a wider audience. I mean if i were to stumble across this anime in my living room i can't explain this to my parents.\\n\\n\r\nStory : 9\\n\r\nThe story is very promising since it's just been 1 episode, and it really portrays the unknown world that occurs in our usual isekai animes. Different then any anime or game we used to play, goblins used to be minor preys that beginners could took out easily. However in this anime, goblins aren't that typical easy to kill creatures for beginners, but a very lustful and all around F-cked up creature. And that\u2019s where The Goblin Slayer comes in to play. Im sure enough as the story progresses the Goblin Slayer wont be slaying just goblins yet much higher up creatures like demos and such, whose controlling the goblins, get where im going at.\\n\\n\r\nArt : 8\\n\r\nThe art is good in it's own right and probably one of the best art I\u2019ve seen as of yet. The Art style is edgy and is very familiar with the manga. This kind of in-depth art and gradient makes it more impactful to me. \\n\\n\r\nSound : 9\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of the anime is Awesome it really portrays the atmosphere of hopelessness and pure epicness when sh!t got real.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters : 9\\n\r\nIf you think the first group of people is the protagonist, well you're wrong because they're generic and mainstream. The MC which is The Goblin Slayer is a total badass in his own ways, he\u2019s not your typical main character. He isn't your typical naive MC or an OP MC for no reason, he built his path to becoming a badass, and sure enough he succeeded in his own accord. The rest of the characters are also likable with each of their own tropes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 10\\n\r\nEven thou I read the manga, watching it animated is a different experience in it altogether. Seeing the characters come alive on the screen is just too thrilling.\\n\\n\r\nBut as stated before, it is quite dark and has some explicit scenes. However if you watch the anime you'll get hooked instantaneously because there's no other anime then this\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 9\\n\r\nIn conclusion it's a hell of an anime with a lot of dark and thrilling atmosphere. It makes you more open in my opinion, it makes you realizes that the world is not a safe space and the fact of the matter is we could act out like the screwed up goblins too. \\n\\n\r\nTherefore as of yet it's only been 4 episode and i have to recommend it straight away. Because just like the manga the anime hooks you in like getting an SSR in gacha games. \\n\r\nAnd when you see the anime all you can say is \"WoW Alexa, This is Epic.\"",

            "content": "Goblin Slayer is a great show. It has great characters, good designs, interesting themes, good plot and a damn great soundtrack. I haven't seen a good dark fantasy anime since re: zero, and it was like, 2 years ago. I really recommend you to watch it if you like RPG games or fantasy series, cause Goblin Slayer is an awesome interpretation of games like D&D.\r\nFor the sake of better understanding, I will refer to Goblin Slayer, the character, as GS, and for the anime, I will simply call it Goblin Slayer.\r\nThat review is REALLY long, so be prepared.\r\nStory 9/10:\r\nThe story of Goblin Slayer is toldin a very good way. When the series need to explain something about the world, it is told to a character that shouldn't know about that or not told at all, only hinted. For example, at the very first scene, when the receptionist (best girl) explain how the ranks at the guild work, she explains it to a person (the priestess) that just entered the guild and doesn't know anything about what adventurers should be doing, or how they are classified. Another example, also in the first episode, is when you see that in the goblins' cave, there is a room where raped woman is (yes, there is rape in the series), and next to this room, there is a place where baby goblins are, so you can assume that goblins use woman to reproduce. This is supported by the fact that you see goblins through the entire episode, and there are no females.\\n\r\nAnother thing about the story is that the pacing is well communicated, and everything that happens matches with what feeling you're supposed to feel, and everything that happens has a good reason to happen. I don't want to enter spoiler territory, so I'll just say that the overwhelming stuff that happens in the first episode makes complete sense. Everything seems really realistic.\\n\r\nJust a quick note, the scene where the party talk about the beliefs that they have is amazing in a worldbuilding standpoint.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10:\\n\\n\r\nThe art of the show is pretty good. The character designs are well done and make sense if you think about what they actually are. GS, in special, is super well animated, and the gimmick with the glowing eye when he is about to kill monsters is super good looking. The show, in general, is well animated as well. The CG blends nicely with the environment most of the time. Mad House (the studio that made Overlord) should learn with White Fox (that made this anime) how to do it right.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10:\\n\\n\r\nMAAAAAAAAAN, this soundtrack is lit. Every single BGM fits well with the scene and adds feeling to the situation. Example, in the 4th episode, when GS use the scroll (you will know what I am talking about if you watched the series), the music stops, making you think about what is happening, cause you are not certain if he actually used the scroll or turned into OP swordsman for some other reason at the moment. Actually, the soundtrack gets so much better when GS is in the scene every single time. The metal/rock music that plays every time that is goblin killing time does so much hype. The opening song fits perfectly to the series as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9/10:\\n\\n\r\nGS: GS is a really well-written character. He is someone that is traumatized because of what happened to him, and because of that, he is all closed and doesn't know how to relax. He is always thinking about how to act if goblins appear and attack someone, and he doesn't matter if the world is ending, or if there is a treat to the humanity, he will just kill goblins. And GS is really good at it, actually, so he is silver rank, that is like, the second best rank. The concept of his character is interesting. The whole point of him is that somebody has to do the job that no one wants. I will return to that topic later.\\n\\n\r\nPriestess: She is basically the \"normal person\"-character. This type of character is really important in that type of story where not everything needs to be explicitly said to you. It is really nice to see how much someone changes by being with GS and his crazy life and also shows contrast to him.\\n\\n\r\nElf: She is so fun. Really, she is someone that I would like to have as a friend. Her interactions with the dwarf are also really good. Her backstory about living 10000 years inside a forest, and became an adventurer to explore the world makes all sense if you see how she acts\\n\\n\r\nDwarf: He is a drunk dwarf. There is not much to him until that point in the series.\\n\\n\r\nLizardman: I love his respectful and calm personality even with the dark stuff that happens. His summoning magic is really cool too.\\n\\n\r\nGoblins: The actual main characters. What makes goblins good villains is that everyone sees goblins as pure evil creatures. But if you think about all the cruel stuff that they do, like killing people and raping people, IT MAKES SENSE! They need to kill people that are threats to them, so they don't die and need to rape woman to reproduce, so it is completely justified to them to do that. Also, because they need to do that to survive, it is completely impossible to goblins and humans to coexist, making their fight with people really necessary. The fact that every single person underestimate them but they are pretty powerful in groups is a great concept. I should point out that you should hate goblins, cause despite they need to kill people, they are a threat to the society, and they probably would rape your mother and kill your friends if they could.\\n\\n\r\nParty of the first episode (spoilers of the first episode here): They are a great picture of how it is dangerous to be alive in this world, and how nobody cares about what are the risks of being an actual adventurer here. The average anime mc of the group is all confident because he killed some goblins that tried to kill people in his village, but he doesn't think about the equipment that he using or the environment that he is fighting. The bitch wizard does not get close to the melee fighters and don't recognize the danger of dealing with close-range threats. The monk doesn't look at the full picture of the situation, and a fat goblin appears without she noticing it. That's why all of them are dead (the monk is dead inside).\\n\\n\r\nSide characters: I should point out that the side characters are good, and they could be potentially important characters through the series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10:\\n\\n\r\nI don't want to say much about this, cause that topic is completely my opinion, and I don't think that any argument would completely justify how I am loving this anime. If you didn't like it as much as I liked, whatever, and if you liked it more than me, whatever too.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10:\\n\\n\r\nGoblin Slayer is a solid anime. Its plot is well-written, and its themes are interesting and looks like they are going to be explored. The soundtrack fits the moments and makes a lot of hype to the scenes. What happens always have a reason, and that reason is well stablished during the series. If you like dark shows, or fantasy stories, or dark fantasy stuff, you must check this anime out. \\n\\n\r\nWell, those were my 1200+ words about everything that I think about Goblin Slayer. Hope you liked it! If you think this was helpful to you, tell it to MAL, clicking the \"helpful\" button. See you later, in a review of another anime that I want to talk about. Bye.",

            "content": "[Spoiler obviously]\r\nGoblin Slayer was probably the most controversial anime of 2018, diving the otaku community between those who couldn't care less about it's use of violence to shock and the ones who were too sensitive to watch or just some SJWs. With all this controversy and some genres that I like this anime was a must watch for me at the time.\r\nSTORY:\r\nThe story follows Goblin Slayer on a journey for vengeance agains goblins, beings who are pure evil, they will kill men in the most brutal way and rape girls for their own pleasure, be it on their caves or when they go outside toattack somewhere they are always a threat to humanity, a threat disregarded and not taken serious by the heroes and adventurers of that world, who sees those creatures as weak, easy to kill and not dangerous despite multiple people being victims of their attacks, making no sense to me but I still give a pass to it because isn't something that annoys me or anything and contributes to build the character of Goblin Slayer and thus making what he does feel special.\\n\r\nThe world building of this anime is something bizarre, on the beggining of the series Lizardman, one of the members of Goblin Slayer's party says that his wish is to one day become a dragon, however the confusing part of it is that on a episode between this one, a adventurer says that what he wants is to kill a dragon, so will the dragons hunt him after he became a dragon? if yes then why turn into one? this is just one of many examples of things you could ask yourself while watching the anime because it doesn't explain nothing about it's world, the only thing told to the audience is that there are goblins and they need to be killed because they are pure evil.\\n\r\nEven with Goblin Slayer using an armor from toe to head 24/7 and being socially awkward the guy still manages to conquer the heart of every girl he faces with, if you took the harem out of the anime the plot would still be the exact same.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION/SOUND:\\n\\n\r\nIf the first thing I watched of this anime was the opening, I would think that this anime was beautifully animated but that's not the case, it's a visually boring and unnapelling animation with poor character design choices, most of the characthers on the anime look pretty generic. Another down is the CGI that despite not being a mess that we use to see, still odd when is mixed with an entire 2d animation.\\n\r\nLooks like they reserved all of their budget to animate the fights scenes and BOOBS. I gotta admit that those look really cool, specially on episode 10 where in the end of the fight against some goblins had a trully nice scene of a bird point of view that made the moment impactful.\\n\r\nThere are plenty of moments of fanservice on this show, boobs are moving on an exaggerate way and even a moment when a female character is supposed to show to the audience the scars on her skin it turns to be kinda hard because the scene makes her looks hot and the scars almost unseen, people should've feel sorry for her and not get a bone.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of the anime is nothing too expecional in my opinion, has it's good moments here and there, but nothing that was able to make an unforgiven memory on me. The opening/ending themes also doesn't appeal to my taste in music, not that is bad, but doesn't get me hyped to watch the episode or makes me want to listen again.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:\\n\\n\r\nThe only character that I could enjoy through the course the anime was it's main character, unlike the others he wasn't full of bullshit, doing things when things should've been done and also having a intriguing and dark past that makes the decisions of his life and lonely personality legit.\\n\r\nNow things begins to make little to non sense or are just annoying. The priestess that we follow in the beggining of the infamous episode 1 decides to join Goblin Slayer after the horrible events that she faced, but the thing is that she accepted without any hesitation the invite, acting like the disgusting things that happened to her one day ago was nothing, even smiling at the guy like if happy times were waiting for her by standing with him.\\n\r\nThe other members of Goblin Slayer's party are pretty much copy pasted their relationships from Lord of the Rings, the dwarf and the elf discuss every episode for no reason at all but to be a generic and stereotyped version of Legolas and Gimli.\\n\r\nThe elf of the anime is absurdly annoying, she is totally clueless that her life and the life of her friends are on the line and she constantly says to Goblin Slayer: \"No water, poison, fire or explosion\". Her life is in danger and she doesn't want the goblins to have (in her opinion) brutal deaths and thus putting the party on strict situations.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\\n\r\nI enjoy artworks based on a fantastical middle age, especially when it has a touch of violence on it and that's what made me follow Goblin Slayer untill the end but the problems of the anime are so much that neard the end I was just hoping to end as soon as possible.\\n\\n\r\nIf someone just wants to enjoy an anime full with brutal violence and fanservice so this can be the right anime, even tough I would recommend some better ones at this function Goblin Slayer still can be enjoyable to the right people, but there is nothing more than supercial stuff on this anime.",

            "content": "Once when the sound of footsteps suddenly fell silent then the events and dreams vanished with just a few moments.Welcome to 2018's most controversial anime? What problems made the first episode riot some scenes of rape? dripping blood? or other? it is just a matter of conflict they face. The story is made only to entertain it does not matter to them if the problem they face is still just fiction, isn't it too much to enlarge the problem?\r\nIt was determined in the three-month problem that it was a difficult matter, focusing on a man named Goblin Slayer and starting with a pretty fair sceneinside the cave. Through a coincidence Goblin Slayer met Onna Shinkan, who was crying and praying in the cave. Actually inside the cave there are reports that there are goblin base inside.The strange thing is that these goblins don't prey on humans or steal their treasures just kidnap and deprive a woman of virginity to breed. Events in this episode may at first seem very furious or controversial, but this is actually an interesting storytelling method because it requires a lot attention and thoroughness from the audience. The track that quickly takes the right steps makes this story even more interesting because it is the last part of the film to move with exciting clips.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation in this installment are the usual steps for whitefox. Given the series they aired before, it's hard to believe that they have surpassed themselves, but they succeeded with their efforts here, animations in Japan are well known throughout the world, and various sequences of actions are very detailed without suffering major losses in quality. Animations are very well made and integrated, and can hardly be distinguished from traditional animation in many sequences.\\n\\n\r\nThe design of the character from the start is not much there is a change in this studio, the only difference is just a slayer goblin has a unique design that always brings the armor everywhere, the monster design for this is very kind of similar to some of the sources I have read in the ancient mythology books, there is a quesiffal product for its features that sometimes conscious with his actions.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors are very good, the compatibility between the characters is very good, their voices are very suitable with their respective character age. In some scenes they show the quality with good background music that makes the atmosphere more tense to make its own attraction. There are also their performance very well they are the authors of the opening and closing themes of their role is very important for the progress of this series and they succeeded in bringing it.\\n\\n\r\nIt should not be surprising, that an area of \u200b\u200bthe film falls with the character. Continuously there is little or no justification for the actions of those who for some reason never call their names to each other and how suspicious they cover the face of the main character until it runs out, although with that lack of action sequence still quite satisfying genre addicts.\\n\\n\r\nA work is judged not to be as good as what film they make but a perfect assessment based on the desires of the viewer's heart.",

            "content": "Goblin Slayer is simply not interesting enough to warrant the attention it receives. Fans of the show seem to think there is a secret agenda set against it that drives any criticism it receives. Perhaps because they want to believe that it is edgy and that they are somehow superior for being able to handle dark content, but this is not the case. Outside of the first ten minutes, Goblin Slayer is a tame and ultimately boring experience.\r\nThere are still a few things to like about this show: the adventurers have their limitations and losing seems a possibility in every fight, Goblin Slayer's obsession withgoblins can at times be funny, the action and the party's interactions are usually enjoyable to watch.  These redeeming qualities just aren't enough, however, to overcome a story that seems nonexistent at the best of times and nonsensical at the worst, filled with characters that are either shallow archetypes or simply well-endowed devotees of the titular character.\\n\\n\r\nAs a protagonist, Goblin Slayer himself is an effort to watch at times. His limited vocabulary can be a fun quirk, but there's a reason why most main characters talk more - across all mediums of story. Two word sentences and flashbacks can only work so well to garner sympathy, so as a viewer you often find yourself staring emptily at the screen wondering how a scene that requires emotional investment could ever have hoped to pay off. Elf, Lizardman, and Dwarf are likeable enough stock additions to the goblin slaying adventures, but are about as well developed as their names imply.\\n\\n\r\nThe arc in Water Town displays the poorest writing Goblin Slayer has to offer. After a repetitive few episodes under the town (with a short break for naked virgin resurrection magic of course), it is confusingly revealed with what I can only chalk up to poor translation that the revered Sword Maiden is responsible for allowing the local goblin incursion to continue because she hoped others would experience her past trauma. This is presented as if it is supposed to be a gratifying plot twist with an emotional confrontation, but it misses the mark entirely. Thus the only tangible development to come out of the four episode arc is that Goblin Slayer wants to make ice cream for his friends, but perhaps that's too dark and edgy for some to appreciate.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Goblin Slayer has enough superficial entertainment to partially mitigate its lack of a compelling narrative, cookie-cutter characters, and weak ambition, the truth is that the show's quality matters little now that it has become a symbol to rally behind for anyone who thinks of themselves as enlightened just because one brutal scene doesn't put them off a show. The opening episode is ironically a reversed microcosm of the series: it presents itself as a cute adventure show, then jarringly juxtaposes this with brutality as if this will become the norm. The deceptive facade it opens with is actually closer to the truth, however, and even if there were further ruthless spectacles, they would not salvage Goblin Slayer's inadequacy in every regard.",

Going back now, it seems that the first episode was only used for shock value to attract attention from the mass episode. I've watched a lot of other fantasy and adventure animes, with tags in guildhalls such as \"Bronze, Silver, etc etc\", but I've never seen one in this fashion. Normally, we follow a main protagonist as he makes his way to the top, but this anime doesn't do that. This anime was unique in the sense that it adds a hint of ordinary life. It doesn't attempt to make the protagonist doanything special. He is just an ordinary man killing ordinary creatures, goblins. As for the animation and depiction of scenes, it was quite gruesome, but I believe this risky move will be a progressive one for the anime industry.",

            "content": "A truly brilliant mockery of Fantasy and potentially Isekai (large overlap) tropes. The world is filled with hapless, happy-go-lucky \"protagonist\" style adventurers, some of them even reaching high rank with this naivety intact. Until something goes, truly, wrong these adventurers always seem to face hardship with optimism and draw strength from these character traits.\r\nIn step the Goblins. Inexperienced and Experienced adventurers alike seem to consistently underestimate the evil and capability of these \"low level\" beasts. There is no glory in slaying a goblin. There is no glory in slaying 100. As such hoards of these beasts are often able to group together and congregate, formingsurprisingly powerful and effective roaming militias, despite their individual low intelligence and strength.\\n\\n\r\nGoblin Slayer is our protagonist. A man who sees this festering, ignored evil and has a single-minded obsession with ending their barbarism. He LIVES Goblin Slaying. He eats solely because his body needs nutrition to kill Goblins. He sleeps solely because he needs to be well-rested to kill Goblins. GS is your standard grim-dark stoic protagonist. Egged on by a terrible past to prevent suffering as much as he, as one man, can.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the series we learn that, while GS goes underappreciated among the ranks of most adventurers, even those below his skill level, that he has garnered a rather impressive cult following among civilians of the world who have seen the horrors roaming bands of Goblins can inflict upon helpless villages and travellers.\\n\\n\r\nThe series mocks overly-positive fantasies where nothing truly goes wrong and the hero and other inhabitants of the world are always safe via last second plot-armour, in the naive and overconfident adventurers found wholesale in the world. The series mocks edgy grim-dark fantasies in the overtly brutal nature of the goblins and GS's character and history. It is interesting seeing a world in which both extreme tropes exist and characters from both interact regularly. I think it also has a positive message about the dangers of dismissing \"little\" threats for too long.\\n\\n\r\nThe majority of negative reviews on this anime accuse it of offering little substance, however to me it seems that, that is the point, as the genre as a whole is over-saturated with power fantasy anime and edgy grim-dark goreporn with little-to-no actual substance or even basic narrative, beyond letting a reader put himself in the place of a powerful protagonist who always comes out on top, regardless of the odds or allow a reader a peek into a cold, uncaring world that does not forgive weakness. GS offers a limited view into both sides of this coin, with the subplot about the perfect seemingly invulnerable \"Hero\" and the naive adventurers and with the main-plot following GS on his darker crusade against the threat of Goblin-kind.\\n\\n\r\nOther negative reviews complain about the infamous (mostly off-camera, barely graphic in any sense of the word) rape scene. They complain it is \"unnecessary\" and \"adds nothing\" to the show. These reviews should be immediately and fully disregarded. The scene is fairly important in cementing the unwavering evil of these creatures that is overlooked due to their weak individual strength by the naive adventurer community as a whole. This complaint is thinly veiled discomfort at darker themes, not a legitimate complaint in any sense. Commonly tacked onto these reviews is a weak complaint from power-trip fans who are upset that the victim doesn't instantly recover from her unspeakable trauma and become a mary-sue of Goblin Slaying.",

            "content": "Goblin Slayer is one of my favorite fantasy series and here's why.\r\nStory\r\nIt's bland story of a man killing goblins. But that's what make it so good. It's pretty realistic, I'll explain why in the character later. How goblins are considered trash and such but this man keep killing them because of his traumatizing past. I love that unlike most fantasy anime with RPG from video game themed, this one has the tabletop RPG theme like DnD with their unique classes like mage dwarf, monk dragon, and stuff like that. Like I said, the story is simple, straightforward, but that what makes it so good. Fromthe title I can say I want them to slay goblins, and hey, it delivers.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nI can feel that they have decent budget. Few CGs here and there, mostly on Goblin Slayer, maybe to make his armor looks shiny while he's walking. But hey, at least the CG is not a total disappointment like Overlord. Other than the CG part, all other animations look nice and fluid. The fighting scenes are really good.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nOne of the few that I like from this anime. Almost all the seiyuu are experienced pros so they work great. Priest Girl especially sounds great. I love her crying and screaming voice and can feel the chill. The music is great, and pretty much serve their purpose. Heart pumping music during fighting scenes, soft music during wholesome scenes. But what I like most? The fighting SFX. The sound of weapons hitting the goblins' flesh, and the sound of the blood spurting, and the arrows flying. They are great and sounds pretty realistic and echoing in my ears. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThis is the best part that I love the most from Goblin Slayer. I especially love that none of the character has an actual name. They're just called Goblin Slayer, Priest Girl, Cow girl, etc. This is one of the series with the \"making the MC looks bland so the other side characters shine\" type in my opinion. But I'll say this, that Goblin Slayer is a pretty realistic character. I worked in hospital where cops bring their criminals and their victims. Goblin Slayer acts similiar to many other people actually acts after traumatizing event (such as rape victims, and DV victims) where they seems to become stoic and lost interest in many other things. And I also love how, unlike Eren from Attack on Titan that swore he will \"kill all titans\", Goblin Slayer clearly shows that he knows he won't be able to kill all goblins, but he will at least try to kill as many as he could. And of course, no generic stuff like suddenly getting superpower, or getting power from friendship. The dude use logic, knowledge, and experience, alongside tons of training. He's like budget Batman. And you can see how with interaction he grows with the other characters later on. Good unique main character, that makes the other side characters shine and doesn't feel like this is the \"main character is the center of the world + other characters\". In here you can feel that... The other characters exists. It doesn't give the \"Goblin Slayer and His Bitches\" feeling. But more like \"this is a group of people with goblin slayer in it\".\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nI really really enjoy this of course. I give this 9 instead of 10 because, well, in the end the story is pretty bland. He comes, he kill goblins, he finished. I don't say I don't enjoy watching goblins getting pummeled, but in the end I still know \"these goblins are getting their butt kicked\". So yeah, that's why this get 9 instead of 10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I give this a 9. Really recommend it. Some parts are indeed a bit disturbing and maybe kinda gory, not something you wanna recommend to people who's new to this kinda series and children of course, but it's enjoyable. The gruesome and disturbing parts just show us about how the world really works and such, and thus should not prevent someone from watching this.",

I mean, I'm not saying it was exactly KonoSuba, but I had some extremely serious KonoSuba vibes and raised my eyebrow like 7 inches when I heard \"Priestess\" and saw a quest board.  Then there are these \"parties\" like a group of adventurers and I was extremely sure that GS was just a KS ripoff.  *Minor spoiler* Then the Priestess joined a group of noobs... and one gets raped, another getsshredded, the third gets killed.  Honestly though their deaths were their fault, since they were honestly pretty shit at handling their weapons.  Then Goblin Slayer comes just in the nick of time and saves the dumbass Priestess who also wet herself (not once but as of episode 8, TWICE).\\n\\n\r\nStory: Story is very simple.  Man loses village to goblins.  Now he kills goblins for a living.  If you couldn't follow that, then go back to Lucky Star.  Just being honest.

I have to admit, the battle scenes are pretty cool though, but then again they don't hold a candle to Megumin's explosions.  Also, basically half of every episode is a battle scene... so it doesn't make much room for storytelling.  I like the battles, but I also want some story, which is kind of hard when the story is already told in episode 1.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The censoring is pretty heavy in this anime.  Hair covering nipples, to be very specific.  Personally, I think it should just not be censored as it is R 17 already, so you should expect stuff like SKIN.  Art is okay, I guess, but somewhere around episode 6, I noticed that the animators got lazy.  I don't know how, but it just feels that the art quality dipped slightly.  At least the art isn't like Serial Experiments Lain where you literally have to squint through every damn scene to make out whats background and whats dust on your screen.\\n\\n\r\nSound: VA... is OK I guess.  I'm not a VA expert or anything like that, so I can't judge, but the BGM in this anime feels lacking.  Sound is OK, I guess.  Not great, but usable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: High key Goblin Slayer himself carries this to a 10/10.   All other characters all feel cliche or copied from some other franchise.  The high elf literally brings bread... packaged in a leaf.  Lord of the Rings, anyone?  Lizardman is a shaman... hmmm where have I seen that before?  But I have to admit, a Dwarf magician is something I strangely have never seen before.  Cause Drarves usually use big hammers and smash shit.  And the Priestess... absolute fucking dumbass if I do have to point out.  She's not even loli enough to be cute, nor old enough to be LEWDED.  Also, she's dumb.  Need I say more?  Alright I'll say more.\\n\\n\r\nShe wants to be an adventurer, but she can't handle blood\\n\r\nShe can only cast 3 spells a day... 3 support spells that is...\\n\r\nShe cares about goblins\\n\r\nShe's basically the support character that was initially OP but then got nerfed 100 times and is now unplayable\\n\r\nIgnore that last point, she's the support character that needs a major buff, but since nobody uses her its okay, right?\\n\\n\r\nAlso, it would help if our main fucking cast actually had NAMES.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Not bad, not boring, but definitely not as good as Erased, which I enjoyed from first episode to last (which means you should watch it).  Its ok, I guess. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, is an 8.  I know that not everyone is accustomed to the violence and rape, but those shouldn't be a reason to give it a bad score anyways.  But still, the anime doesn't really deserve the 8 that I'm giving.  I'm just being biased because I like battle scenes.",

            "content": "Goblin Slayer is an anime based on a light novel. I haven't read the light novel, but I probably will try to find out how after this review. Like many light novels, it does things on the risque side, but I feel like Goblin Slayer is more mature than most of these light novel adaptations.\r\nStory - Goblin Slayer is a rather typical fantasy world, but pretty detailed in what it focuses on. I love a fantasy story that goes through things slowly with new details that other fantasy works have not expressed before and Goblin Slayer does not stop doing this unlike most anime whichwill discard a chunk of its depth after the first few episodes. \\n\\n\r\nThe focus in this story and its entertainment seems centrally about strategic decisions in hunting and survival. It is one of those anime that is busy explaining a lot of things, but it won't explain action sequences in fine detail like Naruto or something.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character is Onna Shinkan, a young priestess who is apparently considered an adult at age 15. She decides to start the story by joining a small group of adventurers. We are not given much background into her decision, but this could be assumed to mean that it is normal for people to become adventurers without much of a second thought. Yet goblins are underestimated in this world. People are given reasons to expect goblins to be less threatening as they are to the extent that the youngest adventurers don't fear going on goblin nest quests. \\n\\n\r\nThe first episode basically is meant to contrast a beginner's experience with goblins to an expert's. Not too unexpected, but presentation goes a long way. But the good thing about the main character is that she is not one to underestimate things, making for a good learner, which is why she works so well with the character of the goblin slayer.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is feels more like an event driven story even though the characters are hard to ignore.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, as is indicated by the opening, there are more characters than just the heroine and slayer. I would think that one extra hero would be all right, but instead we have three out of nowhere. This is my main gripe with the show so far, but the world is still better built because of them.\\n\\n\r\nAnother odd and potentially negative part is that there is an episode that focuses on two beginner adventures half the time, just to give some un-needed world building and padding out the episode. Episode 7 also ends with some ridiculous padding, but I guess I don't care about this too much so far.\\n\\n\r\nArt - The art design by itself is pretty simple, but the production is great. Simple designs don't detract much in a more grounded story anyway. There are digital effects and maybe 3D models in some places, but it felt like I was watching a much more pure production like 90's anime, but with cleaner art. A lot of female characters besides the priestess have really big breasts, which is a little bit annoying, but I can forgive it since characters are not all that important in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound - In my opinion, the opening and ending themes are very solid. There is a folksy song that tends to play at the beginning of episodes that I find annoying however. \\n\\n\r\nAs for sound effects, it is quite well done. It is a more horrific story after all so sounds are more central than in other anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - As I mentioned earlier, the goblin slayer and the priestess have great chemistry as central characters. There is a proper balance of fragility and a super powerful guardian, but the priestess is allowed to be useful most of the times which is better than the vast majority of anime. Most of the show feels more secure because the priestess exists despite Goblin Slayer being the one who is keeping her alive. She is also one of the few female protagonists who really serves as a person anyone connects to better than those stupid brown/black haired male protagonists. I really love having her and Goblin Slayer in the story.\\n\\n\r\nGoblin Slayer is a Vash the Stampede/Rurouni Kenshin kind of figure. He is very fixed on his morals, not too talkative and lives a humble life, but he also has insane skill and power that allows him to exist the way he does. But unlike those two protagonists, Goblin Slayer is shown to have serious limits. He actually seems to consider his priestess a valuable resource in battle, using her powers to end fights far more quickly. But he also is hesitant to keep anyone around with him until he develops more. The story really seems to start in the most significant part of his character development, which is good.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the rest of the party, they are introduced around episode 4. They seem like they should be strong considering they are the same rank as people who can slay dragons, but they are pretty pathetic against goblins. They also are characterized pretty poorly and do more to just bring out reasons to flesh out the world. However, they still allow for the story to be entertaining and move forward at a more sustainable pace so they are pretty useful in a meta way.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I feel like many female characters are a little too under-developed. The elven girl just doesn't seem to have anything going for her and seems to have a bit of a fluid, unfixed personality.  The girl that Goblin Slayer knows is not explained very clearly besides as being someone waiting for him to come home. The quest clerk is a bit of an exception since she does not have to have a personality, but she is actually quite humanized and you learn a little about how her job works.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a witch simply called Majo who feels TOO mysterious and ends up basically having a few pretty minor interactions with the story despite appearing to be important. The most notable thing about her is just her voice acting, which is very odd and would likely be written with many ellipses....\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - This is primarily an action anime that should be enjoyable to fans of old-fashioned shounen/seinen. I think it is mostly consistently entertaining, but episodes 4 and 5 felt pretty underwhelming which was almost enough for me to start disliking the show before episode 7 showed me there was still a lot of good scenes to be had.",

            "content": "When I sat down to watch a show about killing goblins titled very plainly, my expectations were low. I wasn't really looking forward to \"MC with X special power defeats villain who is going to /take over/destroy/remake the world,\" but I have to say my doubts were uhh... sidestepped. Goblin Slayer defies expectations entirely, shedding almost all semblance of plot in favor of a twisted amalgamation of slice of life and adventure anime that fails at being a passable version of either.\r\nTraditionally, in an anime that is focused on adventuring and smaller side stories, these stories will have some kind of small plot behind them,generally tying in to one of the characters backgrounds. So far in this show, however, these side stories feel like quests you would get at level 10 in an MMO. \"Clear out these ruins/sewers/forests of goblins\" does not make for a compelling reason to watch the show, and in fact paints the writers into a corner where the only way to make the episode interesting is for one of the characters to almost die. Maybe some central plot will be introduced to spice up the show a little bit, but in its absence, Goblin Slayer must be carried by its characters, which are in no way strong. \\n\\n\r\nThe character writing in this show is far from the worst I have ever seen, but the lack of a centralized plot forces the spotlight on to various characters and their personalities, highlighting their generic tropes. The dwarf and the elf fight, like in every fantasy show ever. There is a lizard/dragon(?) guy who is the token \"wise\" character who has one cute thing that they do to make them actually likeable. The priestess is a pushover, and is for some reason frequently used to drive the ecchi scenes in the show. However the main reason everyone is here is Goblin Slayer, who has a character design like I have never seen before. Orcbolg, in the episodes we have seen so far, has actually no personality, and straight up only enjoys killing goblins. The showrunners take this so far that it feels at times the MC has some form of a social disorder. He is unable to pick up social cues, focuses obsessively on one subject, etc. As female characters begin to develop crushes on him, it is more confusing than anything, as Goblin Slayer treats everyone as a means to an end, only VERY rarely showing any semblance of fondness for anyone else. Watching the show ends up being incredibly strange, as it becomes more and more difficult to believe any characters in the show like him at all. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound and art are generic, with my biggest complaint being that the studio sought it fit to CG  Goblin slayer's armor SO frequently. It never fails at taking me out of what little immersion I had, and just comes off as lazy. The fights in this show have run the gambit in quality, but there have been some memorable fights that I wouldn't mind watching again. As for the gore stuff, it personally doesn't bother me. It isn't as bad as some shows that I have seen, but if you are sensitive to that stuff, especially rape, I would skip this. The opening and ending are not very interesting visually, whether you like the song is up to you though. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I would still recommend watching it. The show for me is a \"so bad its good\" type thing, as watching the other characters interact with Goblin Slayer like they aren't talking to a brick wall is somewhat funny to me. Overall, I would give this show about a 4/10, and it would take a miracle from above to improve that score based on the direction of the show. \\n",

            "content": "This is a show which tries to be intense, gritty, and dark. IT IS NONE OF THOSE THINGS. Goblin Slayer is a very weak, underwhelming show. It's known for being very violent, but the violence is rather mild. It only got that reputation by having a rape scene, which only became notorious because rape is more politically incorrect than violence of a non sexual nature.\r\nWhat makes me say this show isn't dark or intense? The tone is inconsistent. It wastes far too much time with the more goofy, lighthearted scenes. It constantly forgets what it wants to be, and is only interested in pandering toa pathetic audience of neckbeards. And it's definitely isn't intense because there's no action and no suspense. There have been entire episodes with little to no fighting. There's not much of an overarching sense of danger either. They just go around killing goblins, going on the sorts of quests you would see in a video game.\\n\\n\r\nThe video game comment brings me to another point. IT TRIES TO HARD TO IMITATE VIDEO GAMES. It just takes generic high fantasy RPG tropes and neither executes them well nor offers anything interesting or new. These video game tropes do not translate well into an anime medium. These tropes actually work in video games, because they combine gameplay with some real world connections, while there's no reason to do that in an anime series where there's no gameplay to facilitate. It's a pointless way of ruining any chance the show had at being believable. And yes, fantasy has to be believable. It has to be immersive to allow the audience to suspend their disbelief. Goblin Slayer acts too much like a video game, and it has absolutely no immersion whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nLet's not forget that it looks like shit. What in the goddamn hell is the purpose of animating the titular character with that ATROCIOUS fucking CGI model every time he appears? Even when he's just standing there or walking around, they use CGI. It doesn't make sense. Why can't you animate a guy in armor LITERALLY JUST WALKING AROUND? Plus it's really choppy. The CGI is insanely choppy, and so is the 2D animation. It's like watching a slideshow. I guess that's typical of most anime, so I won't take too many points off for that. Good animation is extremely rare in anime. Goblin Slayer is just as lazy as the rest of the garbage in the pile. The character design and settings are nothing to write home about either. Just your standard medieval setting. The elf girl is your standard elf, the dwarf is your standard dwarf, and there's that one chick with big tits for good measure. The female characters are cute. The priestess girl is frankly adorable, but I couldn't give less of a shit about that because this is supposed to be a gritty action show.\\n\\n\r\nThat brings me to the characters. They're all boring. Goblin Slayer is a guy who slays goblins because he has a tragic backstory involving him seeing goblins do bad things which traumatized him and made him want to slay them. That's not even a proper tragic backstory. It could not be less generic. And he could not be less boring and flat. In fact, he's a goofy and laughable character. He literally eats and drinks through a helmet visor. He's like a really lame Doomguy. He even has the word slayer in his name, like the Doom Slayer of the 2016 reboot. There's just nothing charming, unique, or complex about anyone in the show. And why does the elf girl, who's thousands of years old, act so childish?\\n\\n\r\nLet's talk about the PREMISE of the show. A guy who only kills hoards of extremely low level, weak enemies, despite being a powerful warrior whose extensive fighting experience has gained him a high rank as an adventurer. and made him famous. LAME. Why would I want to watch a show about someone who only kills one type of enemy? I want some variety. And why would I watch a show about a guy killing such weak enemies? Doomguy is badass because he kills badass demons. Goblin Slayer is like watching a show about a janitor squashing cockroaches with his broom. There's no sense of danger. Sure, there's an ogre, but the main focus is on weak enemies.\\n\\n\r\nI'll admit, this show's premise would be a great premise for a comedy anime that parodies fantasy tropes. As I already mentioned, the titular character is pretty funny, being someone who eats and drinks through his armor. BUT IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE A SERIOUS SHOW. I'll emphasize that it's *supposed* to be serious. In reality, it's hard to take seriously. And that's one merit of the show. It can be fun if you're watching it just to make fun of it. The first episode had me cracking up. It was just so obvious who was about to get raped. It was like watching a pornstar deliver over-the-top forced one liners in a cheesy porno. But after that it tones down so much that it loses its comedic value.\\n\\n\r\nNow there's one thing I like about this show. I like the OP. It simply sounds pleasing to me. But the rest of the music is underwhelming, so it doesn't gain any points for that.\\n\\n\r\nWhat could this show have done well? Well, it could have had one of the women who was actually raped by goblins become the Goblin Slayer. It is rather misogynistic, isn't it? A male hero has to save these helpless women, and a puppy-like, obedient girl follows the Slayer around and tries to help him. As I mentioned, the show could have been good if it took itself less seriously. Even if it weren't a straight up comedy, it could have embraced its silly premise and focused on just being insanely action packed and over the top. But it found a terrible balance where it's too serious to be fun, yet too silly to take seriously.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want some dumb, mindless, schlocky action, this still isn't the show for you. I love mindless, over the top action. Watch Fist of the North Star for that. This show is too visually unappealing, inconsistent, and strangely devoid of action for that.",

            "content": "Well, here we go (for the second time, thanks MAL). I am writing this review from 5 episodes in for the sake of addressing the controversy. Many will say this anime is bad or that you are a bad person for enjoying it due to the rape themes it entails. However the truth is very different from that. This anime does not glorify rape in anyway, it's absolutely horrifying to watch and sets the tone of the anime and the harsh reality of the world extremely effectively. Not only this but it makes you feel the disgust and hatred for the Goblins the Goblin Slayerfeels. However the general masses can't handle something so confrontational and need everything to be catered to their extreme sensitivities so they label this anime as abhorrent. If you don't like something, don't watch it. Something shown somewhat explicitly is not an indication of sexualization, it's a directorial choice to shove the disgusting reality of this world in the viewer's face. Aside from that I'd say everything else about the anime is pretty great!\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe story has begun with a slow build, developing the characters which I enjoy. I like that it has taken it's time letting you settle into the atmosphere of the anime and getting to know the characters. It's a nice subversion of expectations, taking what are usually weak monsters and showing they have power in numbers and are vile creatures. I don't think the characters need to be thrust on some grand quest or have some huge end goal for it to be interesting, the characters are interesting enough. It keeps the tone mostly dark, aside from when the group is with him or the story switches off to side characters. I'm excited to see how these characters will play into the story later.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\\n\r\nNothing groundbreaking here, pretty good stuff but not amazing. Not a huge fan of how often they use CG for the MC but it looks better than most CG you see in anime and generally isn't too noticeable due to most scenes being at night/in caves etc. Aside from that I love the design of MC's armour.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\\n\r\nYet again nothing special here. Nothing that caught my ear and made me think \"Ooh, that was powerful\" or anything like that. Although I would say the OP and ED for this anime are a head above the rest, I've been loving them.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\\n\r\nWould've given this an 8 because to be honest I think I would have preferred if Goblin Slayer and the priest stayed as a 2-man party. The other characters are fun but it's jarring when they're inserted into the anime with their typical anime tropes and lightheartedness. They have kept a good balance so as to not ruin the atmosphere too much but I think it would have been better if these characters were kept more grounded and they continued to play off the heartlessness of Goblin Slayer and the virtue of the priest.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nAs much as t this anime has it's faults I've been enjoying it extremely and it has thrust me right back into watching anime again. I love the gritty, dark world, the brutality, the stoic MC and the vengeful feelings.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\\n\r\nOverall I'd say this is a pretty nicely wrapped up dark fantasy package that I would highly recommend. I'd reserve 9 or 10 for some of the truly greatest anime but for being unique and extremely enjoyable this one gets an 8 in my books.",

Shounen anime are pretty edgy too but I guess nobody likes those anime ;)\r\nAnyways, what I wantedto bring is the things about Goblin slayer that I felt a lot of people missed out or had fly right over their head. Here they are:\\n\\n\r\n1. Goblin slayer defies conventional RPG tropes\\n\r\nEveryone who plays and knows RPGs usually think that goblins are petty, low level enemies who are really easy to kill. Welp, not even the noobiest of adventurers could do much against the goblins. Rather they got themselves killed by creatures that allegedly have the intelligence of children (ha... that says a lot about the adventurer group). \\n\\n\r\nExcusing the really crappy adventurer party, the anime does show that goblins are capable of killing humans, rather easily (probably because they are always underestimated). \\n\\n\\n\r\n2. The NSFW scene and the perspective on Goblins\\n\r\nYeah, everyone knows about this. It might as well not even be a spoiler. Anyways, whilst I know a huge amount of people hate the anime for this very scene. I sometimes feel like people forget that the scene is intentionally made to be disgusting. It gives us a reason to hate goblins, to believe that they are completely evil monsters. By no means is it meant to encourage rape. Not sure why anyone would come to that conclusion, since the scene is meant to do the exact opposite (Unless you have a fetish for that)\\n\\n\\n\r\n3. The whole situation with goblins raiding villages\\n\r\nThis is the one I think most people miss out on. Yeah, we all know why goblins raid villages, what on earth could we be possibly missing? It's that this whole raiding thing is actually a representation of the Dark ages (There is probably a lot of people who have watched Goblin slayer but don't even know what the Dark ages were; if you do, good on ya, if otherwise, google it). During this time, Raiders would always pillage defenseless villages and DO THE EXACT SAME THINGS THAT GOBLINS DID IN GOBLIN SLAYER. Raiders would, steal money, steal livestock, steal food, steal equipment, rape/kidnap women, kill men and children and all sorts of other dark crap you can think of. The Goblins in goblin slayer are no different to those raiders.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow onto the ratings\\n\\n\r\nStory 6/10\\n\r\nAs far as the main story goes, not a whole lot happens outside of killing goblins. The ultimate goal has to be reached so I can't say a whole lot on this. I don't want to come off as someone who is judgemental so I'll leave it here.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\r\nI think the art is pretty good. You could say I have low standards, but when you learn to actually draw anime characters, you start to appreciate anime art a lot more. Plus, I find Priestess to be pretty cute. (Yes, I'm weak to the MOE attribute, sue me)\\n\\n\r\nPeople often complain about CG in anime. I never really understood why people hate it so much. It has always seemed like a preconceived notion to me. Anyways, I believe that CG wasn't over done in Goblin slayer. The animations themselves weren't to bad either (albeit, CG was usually used in short scenes). At least they weren't overused AND poorly animated like the CG in Overlord where soldiers literally bounced off shields by charging at them (because physics)\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\r\nNothing exceptional, but nothing bad either. I don't have much to say about the sound effects since it mostly consists of stabbing and slashing sounds.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is not to my tastes, but this is completely subjective. I tried not to let my view on the music affect the rating here too much, since, in my experience, it didn't seem to affect the scenes too much.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10\\n\r\nI struggled to rate this one the most. A lot of people will think that the characters are boring or are cardboard cutouts of stereotypical anime tropes. What made me give Characters a balanced  rating was because of the voice acting and the character backstory; which kinda negate the negative of the seemingly bland at first glance personalities all the characters have. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was pretty darn good in my opinion. The way the characters screamed and tried fighting back the goblins seemed at least somewhat realistic to me. I know a lot of people might disagree with me on that, but that's only because I have been in fights where people badly wounded each other. So yeah, I believe that people do scream like that in these kind of fights\\n\\n\r\nBackstory is a quite a sidetrack for me since I read the manga after watching the anime, my opinion will be slightly biased and not representative of the anime here. I think the backstories are vital to the character development here in goblin slayer. Without it, Goblin Slayer really would have seemed like some dense as brick wall kinda guy. I can see how some people view him this way, since his backstory is far better elaborated upon in the manga, but not the anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 6/10\\n\r\nWouldn't exactly say this was enjoyable watch because of the graphic content (unless you have a fetish for that NSFW scene). Which does make sense, since the anime is supposed to be as disturbing as it could possibly be. I dare say that the goblins are doing a good job at that. It feels awkward rating Enjoyment since the whole genre of Goblin slayer goes against it, but I ultimately decided in giving it a lower number.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I think that Goblin slayer does a excellent job at disturbing its audience. It's already evident in how many haters there are. Being a very controversial anime, I tried to stray away from the things people often complained about. I focused more on the representation of things such as how goblins are evil (obviously) and that goblins raiding villages is normal since the exact same thing happened during the Dark ages. \\n\\n\r\nI realise I'm being a massive hypocrite here in saying that people missed the point of goblin slayer since I myself have also skipped over many details. The motive for this review was just to provide another perspective to Goblin Slayer. Pls I beg you, don't sue me T-T",

            "content": "Goblin Slayer is trash!!!! Yes, I said it. I don't know if this anime adapts the Light Novel or Manga, but it does a poor job either way. \r\nPros:\r\n- Goblin Slayer himself\r\n- Music\r\nCons:\r\n- Everything else?\r\nI've read the manga, and it was awesome. The whole story, characters, goblin slaying, all of that was illustrated nicely. There was an actual story, and it was entertaining to follow. It was an overall captivating read. I wonder where all that went into making the anime. \r\nGoblin Slayer himself is a walking CGI behemoth, and to make matters worse, he's the only character fully clad in that atrocious style ofanimation. Everyone else was animated normally, making GS look so out of place. His backstory is barely touched upon, just vague glimpses.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of the problems stem from censorship. The manga had a lot of shock value. Mostly because of the rape, but also because of its violence and stuff like that. The anime doesn't really capture the dark undertones of the fantasy genre, only dodging around the violence. I mean, there's still blood, but it just feels like a normal fantasy world. If I recall correctly, the manga really focuses on how dangerous goblins are. That's why GS is so caught up on killing them all. As for this anime, it just feels like the villains pose no threat. \\n\\n\r\nThe only character worth noting is Goblin Slayer. Most of his dialogue is usually one word answers, but he's still pretty funny to be completely honest. Yeah, he's covered in CGI but I love how he keeps talking about goblins, goblins, goblins. Everyone else is okay. I mean, the characters don't really have much depth to them. They're all walking cardboard. \\n\\n\r\nNot to mention the freaking voice actors! Maybe it's just me, but the voices do not fit the characters at all. Or rather... they're not trying. The way they speak is so monotone and boring. For example, the witch. She took up a lot of screen time just because of how slow she is. It wouldn't be a problem if you were just reading the dialogue, but you actually have to listen to her talking for who knows how long. Not a good experience to say the least. Overall, the VA's don't look like they put much effort into their roles.\\n\\n\r\nThe only real reason to watch Goblin Slayer is because of Goblin Slayer. That's it. I was bored throughout. Maybe it's because I pretty much know what's going to happen, but there's really nothing special nor extraordinary about this show. And that's the point I guess. It's all about slaying goblins. But still... This is only my thoughts based on the first four episodes. Maybe this will get better later on. Who knows? It's just off-putting as a manga reader.",

            "content": "Fair warning that this anime has a lot of gore/violence in it. \r\nWhat I like about this show is that it knows what it is and what it wants to keep being. A lot of shows try to be several things at once so they can appeal to larger audience which causes them to have a good start and concept but fail later on and drop in quality of their story. But that is not case with Goblin Slayer.\r\nThis anime is not a must-watch but it is good and definitely worth your time if you do watch it. I've seen two types of peoplewith views on this anime, either they love it or they hate it. So you should check it out and see which side of the spectrum you're in. The first episode itself will let you know whether you want to continue watching it or drop it then and there.\\n\\n\r\nAlso to note that the author of the story is a huge fan of Dungeons & Dragons so expect a few characters and details in the world to be based on that.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY - 6/10 \\n\r\n Story isn't too complicated and fairly basic. Something bad happened in the protagonist's past and now he has dedicated his life to slaying Goblins. Hence the name - Goblin Slayer. Now it might not seem much but the show knows what it is and what it wants to do so it's pretty much guaranteed that it will be consistent till the end. The shows uses this concept nicely to bring in new characters which do not feel out of place or random. It is a lot like a video game where there is a guild, you form a party and go on quests.\\n\\n\r\nART and ANIMATION - 7/10\\n\r\n The art isn't the most unique but still looks good. The animation is clean and looks good and feels fluid during the action scenes. Although there is a random use of CGI in the less important scenes like when the characters are just walking (without any dialogue) and it is only there for a second or two (most people won't even notice it but it feels random and serves no purpose). But they don't use it in the important scenes so it shouldn't be a problem.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND - 5/10\\n\r\n The sound is alright nothing much to say there. Fits in well and doesn't feel out of the place but is easily forgettable. The opening and ending look visually good but song wise they are okay.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER - 8/10\\n\r\n The strongest aspect of the show. There hasn't been many episodes so don't expect some major character development. But each and every character is very likable (except the Goblins). The protagonist isn't your usual in a fantasy/harem setting. He is however the guy with a tragic past and looking for revenge type. But he acts different from characters like that. He has one goal set in mind and nothing can distract him from that. Money? Women?Relationships?Happiness? He doesn't care about any of that, he's not interested in/want anything in life. The Goblin Slayer only wants to wake up everyday - kill goblins -go to sleep - repeat. Honestly, it is a bit refreshing to see a main character like this. The others characters too have their own goals and have good chemistry with each other.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT - 8/10\\n\r\n It is very fun to watch, especially the action and characters. The action scenes when they're killing Goblins are explained very well and not just randomly swinging around your weapon.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL - 7/10\\n\r\n It isn't very unique but a certainally good watch. I personally find it good and I'm definitely going to read the manga and the light novels after finishing the anime.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Goblin Slayer is a refined piece of fantasy anime, making use of an unabashedly generic fantasy world to tell an ultra-focused and entertaining story about killing goblins.\r\nThe series is memed out as being a gore-filled rape fest, but rape isn't so much an on-screen occurrence as it is an ever-present threat. When you see your favorite Elf character being pinned down by goblins there's an added layer of fear because you know the goblins don't just want to murder her.\r\nOne interesting part about Goblin Slayer is that there is almost \"anti-world building\" in the sense that the viewer is assumed to automatically understand most ofthe fundamental aspects of the world. There's a kingdom with knights and wizards, but there's also the threat of demons and all of the monsters that serve them. Adventurers go to a guild in town and take quests to slay monsters. The viewer knows everything there is to know about this world immediately. The characters don't even have names, they are referred to by their titles or classes.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is a bit smarter than it lets on but nothing brilliant. There are some interesting themes. I specifically enjoyed the \"Wanderer\" speech Goblin Slayer makes, comparing himself to a high tier goblin who has suffered, but survived and learned from his adversity. We see this theme pop up in the finale when the Priestess resists the begging of the Goblin Lord.\\n\\n\r\nThe real enjoyment of the show comes not from an imaginative or unique setting, but from the titular Goblin Slayer doing what he does best, slaying goblins. He is grouped up with a generic but lovable band of adventurers and sent off on quests to achieve that end. Everything is paced near-perfectly to make this show incredibly binge-friendly. The animation is slick, the gory fight scenes are a beauty to watch (especially because of how easy it is to hate these little green fucks), the music is fitting. It all works together in an amazing way.\\n\\n\r\nGoblin Slayer does what anime should do - it entertains. Don't expect anything life changing, but do expect an extremely enjoyable ride.\\n\\n\r\n8/10",

            "content": "Just personal scratch.\r\nAdvised, possible spoilers.\r\nOpinion & Informal\r\nArt: 5/10\r\nMix of traditional-style and cgi elements. For the most part, human anatomy and proportions looked fine. Non-human characters checked out too. Backgrounds, nature and supporting details looked about average. Overall, the art quality was below average and nothing really looked clean or crisp. Did not translate the memorable manga impact shots into the art: impact shots that were in this show looked weak, rushed, or completely misinterpreted when compared to what was able to be conveyed in the manga. My biggest gripe out of everything with this adaptation was the extremely disappointing adaptation of the manga's great impactshots. For example, the \"Which one's next? You? You? Or you?\" was terribly done in the anime. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 5/10\\n\r\nClear use of shortcuts in a lot of the animation. Heavy use of selective framing, using cgi for a majority of anything that wasn't a static picture, dropping or low amount of frames for fast movement or action. Body language and mannerisms felt stiff. Gestures and motions felt forced or unreal. Impact sequences looked cool but lacked the polish to make them great. Overall, unhappy with the below average animation. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\r\nThe character designs were on point and were adapted nicely. Character personalities fit pretty well too. Goblin Slayer felt like Goblin Slayer, but that's only saying so much since the dude's a monotone hunk of metal. I appreciate that the sorcerer woman was given an interesting speech pattern that isn't apparent in the manga. The anime did a good job here because it added a lot to her character and made her more interesting. Background characters and minor supporting characters felt pretty flat. I would have liked some more artistic freedom in the development of some of the characters for this adaptation such as an extended filler segment or episode.; having a filler episode that's fairly tame in development is totally fine because it adds value to the adaptation and it fleshes out characters albeit by just a small amount. Overall, this adaptation did a good job of translating and \"giving life to\" the characters.\\n\\n\r\nPlot & Development: 7/10\\n\r\nThe manga was more or less adapted 1 for 1. I don't recall there being any filler segments that I haven't seen from the manga. There were some changes in the presentation of the narrative to make things more clear which was fine. Overall, things happened as they should have, things happened when they should have, and things were presented well enough to make me appreciate the whole effort.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 5/10\\n\r\nMusic was generic guitar strings. Unmemorable. Soundboard was acceptable. No sound design to note. I liked the OP and ED. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion: 7/10\\n\r\nI personally liked the conclusion. The conclusion was a very appropriate and much appreciated culmination of Goblin Slayer's journey thus far. If there's one thing this adaptation did right, it was the final scene. Although I knew pretty much what would happen for the entire anime, the final scene really hit home. I really liked how the final scene tied together all of Goblin Slayer's adventures thus far: meeting the Cleric girl, leaving his solo nature behind and forming a party, and slowly becoming more and more human were all represented by the final scene. Goblin Slayer's journey from a monotone hunk of metal to a human-like monotone hunk of metal, removing his helmet, is something that this adaptation did well in adapting at the VERY end. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\r\nAverage adaptation that I was originally questioning the necessity of; why adapt it if it's going to be such poor quality? Eventually came to tolerate it because of the ending scene. Overall, average art, below average animation, and decent character building because of its good adaptation of certain characters and Goblin Slayer's development.",

            "content": "If you're reading this, I'm sure you've heard about some of the controversies associated with the thing depicted in \"Goblin Slayer\". If not, then you should be warned that some people have been offended and put off to the series due to graphic scenes of violence and rape. This anime got a bad rap so fast and some people were too blind to get over these scenes to get to the great story-telling it has behind it. \r\nDISCLAIMER: This is my second review ever and I'm sure you may hear these points somewhere else. This review may also contain SPOILERS\r\n\"Eventually, everyone reaches their limit, whetherit be an adventurer or a hero\"\\n\r\nSTORY 8/10\\n\\n\r\nGoblin Slayer starts in a fantasy world, full of adventurers and demons. The cliche world is what makes Goblin Slayer good. The creator has taken the classic tale of a hero defeating the demon lord and thrown it into the background. Instead, the story focuses on the \"Goblin Slayer\" working as an everyday adventurer. Some would argue that there is no coherent story, as episodes are usually one-offs but are referred to later on. This is a misconception, as the story revolves around the Goblin Slayer's backstory and his journey to recovering from the horrors he had faced during childhood. \\n\\n\r\nThe Hero and her party eventually slay the demon lord in the world and the world is freed. The kingdoms rejoice and celebrate the victory, but Goblin Slayer pays no attention to this. The anime shows him preparing for his next mission. This is because the author wanted to show that the world moves onward after the demon lord is defeated, and Goblin Slayer is a character who knows that the most. The threats of the world have not changed, and the story does a perfect job of depicting that. \\n\\n\r\nThe theme of PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder) is also brought into the series, as scenes depicting Goblin Slayer's past are shown. The story shows these gruesome scenes to help define the character and build the world. Goblin Slayer lives with the constant fear of the terror of the goblin race and as the story progresses and he builds a party of his own, his PTSD progressively fades. The story of healing creates a relatable character. Goblin Slayer, the anime, shows that focusing on minor points in the plot help build up a great anime. There are few people who understand the threat of the goblins, and because of that, they go unnoticed and the people who live through the terrors that the goblins bring are forgotten as well. The previous Hero, the sword maiden, lives with these scars both physically and mentally and meets with Goblin Slayer, knowing that he is one of the only people who could feel the same way as her. Displaying the helplessness of those with traumatic pasts help to define how the world views goblins, even if the person is the saviour of the world.\\n\\n\r\nThe story and character development go above and beyond, especially in episode 10. In this episode, the farm girl sits with Goblin Slayer under the stars. She speaks to him about the future, although he doesn't understand what she means by this. The farm girl has been previously introduced as a minor character with little involvement in the Goblin Slayer's work but is connected to his past. The following scene helps illustrate the sadness she feels for the Goblin Slayer and that, though she is cheerful, she understands the world as much as Goblin Slayer does. She begins a monologue explaining the life of adventurers. Adventurers will eventually grow old and tire. Eventually, the toughest people reach their limit. Though the people celebrate the victory against the Demon Lord, these days won't last forever. The Goblin Slayer will eventually tire and will perish as well, and this thought frightens her the most.\\n\\n\r\nART 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art for the world of Goblin Slayer is superb. Details in the armour, weapons, and even the environment help to create an atmosphere of terror that the creator was aiming for when writing the novels. While some complain about the CGI of goblin slayer or the goblins, I have found that it works well in this series. The evergrowing overuse of CGI in series has created a stigma behind its use altogether. Granted, there is no denying there usually isn't a need for it but CG animations can create a feel in scenes like a battle that regularly drawn animations cannot. The weight of a swing and the movement of a character is easier to depict to develop a sense of a well-choreographed battle. While it isn't necessarily needed for the Goblin Slayer, it does its job well. The clothing of the characters and their equipment help define their roles well, both in the party and with their personality. \\n\\n\r\nOn to the controversial scenes. These scenes depict the gruesome killings of adventurers and the rape and torture endured by the characters who come into contact with these goblins. I understand why some would find this offensive, but they play a crucial role in creating the atmosphere of the series. Do I think there is another way to depicting the horrors of the goblin race? Probably, but do I think there is a better way of doing so? No.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe theme of growth and change is especially relevant in this series. A common complaint I've seen from others is that the Goblin Slayer character has no emotion and that he's a \"brick wall\" when it comes to personality. The characters in Goblin Slayer also don't have names and are referred to by their respective classes such as a priest or dwarf mage. While Goblin Slayer, the character, doesn't do much on his own to create a personality, his dialogue, actions, and his backstory do. The Goblin Slayer is presented as a quiet high-ranked adventurer, who is sometimes questioned for his status as the only kills low-level Goblins. As the story progresses, we see how his character is intelligent and capable as a warrior and that he rarely speaks because of his cold exterior. We are shown bits and pieces of his past to develop his reason for fighting and show the regrets he has. Goblin Slayer is a character that believes he must atone for his failures, as he could not prevent the rape and killing of his sister from the Goblins and although he has shown the capability of a skilled warrior, he too as admitted that he fears the goblins, but he hides it in battle. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters around Goblin Slayer help to change his perspective on the world and grow as a person little by little. His party helps him open up to others and begin to forget about his traumatic past. The Farm Girl helps to define what is left of his humanity and shows that he has a limit.\\n\\n\r\n\"Even if he doesn't die, there'll come a day when he'll no longer be able to slay goblins. These days won't last forever and when that day comes, what can he do? What should he do?\"\\n\\n\r\nSOUND/MUSIC 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOpinion on sound and music is always subjective to the person experiencing it. In my opinion, the music shown in this series is fantastic and rivals that of the emotional music I've seen in popular anime movies. When I talk about the music, I don't just mean the Opening or Ending themes. While those are great, I find the score or the soundtrack amazing. The scene I described earlier in episode 10 proves this better than any scene in the anime. The choice of an orchestral score helps illicit emotion in the viewer. The understanding of what the farm girl describes and how the world never changes. The melancholy tone to contrast scenes of celebration help depicts her points as facts. I've rarely seen an anime where the music fits in so perfectly with battles, dialogue, or world building.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I believe this anime is fantastic. The in-depth depiction of a world that cares little about low-level creatures helps to build the scars our characters bring with us and how we struggle to come to terms with our past and our future. The Sword Maiden is left forever changed by her past with the goblins and is unable to find someone to understand her grief. The Goblin Slayer tries to atone for his failure to protect his sister and continues on his quest to eradicate goblins. The farm girl understands the sad future that awaits The Goblin Slayer on his path to destruction and does her best to be by his side with the precious time they have. This series is a knockout and I think anyone who truly appreciates the fantasy genre would love this series.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Goblin Slayer is a simple anime at its core. There are only goblins that have to be slain. You won't find anything more profound in the anime. But I wouldn't necessarily consider it a bad thing. I'd say that it's something new in a genre all about high stakes. \r\nStory: 6/10\r\nThe animation in the Goblin Slayer is not exceptional, but it's also not bad. It feels fluid and satisfying. Of course, there are some terrible CGI moments, but I'm happy they used CGI in more still parts of the anime instead of the action ones. Overall I\u2019d say the backgrounds and character designs were verydetailed and eye-pleasing for an anime that used CGI to cut corners in some parts.\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of Goblin Slayer is something I enjoyed very much, but on that, I might have a bias. Since Mili is the group that made the OP and some of the OST in Goblin Slayer, and I'm a fan of that group. Nevertheless, the soundtrack has the right tone for every situation. It's somber when you need it, and it gets your blood pumping during the essential action sequences.\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters in Goblin Slayer are simple, but they do develop throughout the anime, so you can't say they are two-dimensional, even though we know them only by their job titles.\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nFor a show that's entire premise is based on slaying the goblins, I'd say it's extremely enjoyable. The kills are satisfying while the slice of life parts serve as a good breather between the more intense sections. \\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall It's pretty good anime, with a decent plot and characters. It's not that dark as whistleblowers made it seem. And for those who say that \u201drape scene\u201d ruined the smile for them, I say grow the f**k up, try watching Claymore or Berserk and then complain. The rape scene served its purpose very well. You are no longer sympathetic to a Goblin race, the race that needs to abduct women to reproduce. It made goblins seem scarier than their conventional counterpart. But Crunchyroll is a bit at fault because they rated the show PG-13 which it isn't. Now they put a disclaimer in front of every episode as if anime was the darkest fantasy of all time.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Every once in a while there comes a series that becomes the highlight of the season. You keep seeing memes and discussions and you ask yourself, why is this popular? Am I missing out on something, or is this show as bad as it seems?  Spoiler alert: In this case, it is.\r\nStory: \r\nGoblin Slayer is a pretty simple show. It\u2019s about a dude who just wants to go around slaying goblins. The story isn\u2019t your typical isekai, since it\u2019s in a fantasy setting to begin with, but it features ranks and missions that heavily remind you of this genre. However, the story doesn\u2019t goanywhere. You keep asking yourself, is there a point to my suffering? Unfortunately the answer is no. Through all these episodes, we\u2019re just watching Goblin Slayer going on missions to slay goblins with a bunch of forgettable characters again and again. And if there are a few episodes with no missions, there\u2019s literally no plot. We just see some characters wandering around doing nothing, instead of deepening our understanding of the characters. If the characters don't have meaningful interactions or emotional depth during the screentime then you can't seem to care about them or the rest of the guild. There\u2019s absolutely nothing to follow. You just wait for some progression that never comes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nHOLY SHIT if you thought the plot was bad then prepare to go even lower. Goblin Slayer, our main character, is so bland it\u2019s comical. He only thinks about goblins, and his vocabulary simply consists of the words \u2018\u2019goblins\u2019, \u2018\u2019yes\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2019I see\u2019\u2019. His VA must have had a ball while reading the script! Goblin Slayer is supposed to be a tragic character because his life was basically ruined by goblins. Nonetheless, you simply can\u2019t feel bad for him because his past is described in a very vague and half-assed manner. It\u2019s as if the author was on his third glass of wine like \u2018\u2019Oh so the MC has to kill goblins but there needs to be a reason. Hmm what could it be? Let\u2019s write the most generic scenario possible and leave out any details\u2019\u2019. But I digress, let\u2019s get on with the rest of the cast. The Priestess is our secondary main character. She\u2019s the typical meek and mild character, but she proves herself useful with her spells during combat. Another character we have is the Cow Girl, she\u2019s a friend of Goblin Slayer from the past. She lives in a remote farm, and she\u2019s the caring older sister type, who is simply waiting around for Goblin Slayer for days on end. There\u2019s also the High Elf, who is an annoying tsundere with no reason for existing, Guild girl, whose sole role is to gives out quests, Lizardman and Dwarf, who keep arguing with the Elf girl for no reason. As you might have noticed, none of these characters have a personal name. You simply call them by the term that indicates their role, appearance or usefulness. While not intentional, I think this really helps you understand how one-dimensional and forgettable the cast is. I wish I could expand on each character in the guild, but they're so cliche and underdeveloped it's impossible.\\n\\n\r\nAnother problem I have with the show is its gratuitous rape scenes. In the series, the goblins are so depraved and hateful that they rape female characters. However, the writing is incoherent in this aspect. If you\u2019re doing a show where you agree that rape is awful, then you should commit to its conseqences by either denoting how traumatizing it is OR by simply not sexualizing girls so much, to the point of trivializing the issue. Hell, there was a rape scene in the first episode, and in the beginning of the second one there was already totally unnecessary fanservice! There's even a female character that was raped by goblins yet she's a walking fanservice-- an extremely seductive character with huge breasts that defy gravity. As a side note, I am not saying fanservice is bad. If you're an anime fan you've seen your fair share of boobs and ass shots, for better or for worse. My issue lies with the particular setting and how lightly it's treated.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nGoblin Slayer is a badly written show. Even if its theme is supposed to be Goblin Slayer\u2019s humanization through creating bonds, it ultimately falls flat because all characters fail to have a personality or any meaningful interaction with each other. If you can\u2019t like or relate with the characters, you can\u2019t root for them or feel bad for them. The animation and OST are the only redeeming features, although they're nothing outstanding. Unless you\u2019re interested in random combat quests with no regard for the characters, I would recommend staying away from this.",

            "content": "*Fair warning first* This review may contain some spoilers so please keep in mind. This is also going to be my first review so bear with me\r\n     A lot of anime in the Fantasy genre or Isekai anime in a fantasy setting(or basically almost every fucking isekai at this point) have been pretty oversaturated with the easy going atmosphere and overpowered main characters. That Time I got Reincarnated as a Slime is a pretty falls into this category quite nicely, with the goblins being kind and tame creatures. But watching Goblin Slayer this season, it'snow impossible for me to even think about goblins that way at all.\\n\r\n      Goblin Slayer is a Dark Fantasy anime about a man that forms a party of adventurers to hunt goblins. The title is pretty self-explanatory right? It's got everything you'd want in a Dark Fantasy. You got blood and gore, lots of action, and it's also got some rape...I mean cute waifus ecks dee. \\n\r\n      There was a lot of controversy at the beginning of the show on how it depicted the pretty graphic rape scene in , which made a lot of Social Justice Warriors on twitter go into a frenzy. \"If you like this show then you're just a stupid edgelord that enjoys harassing women and minorities\". The main criticism I see about the show is that its needlessly edgy on how scenes of sexual assault is nothing but empty shock factor, and I think that's pretty fucking retarded. Let me go a little in depth just in case there are some triggered SJWs reading my awful review who dislike the show for the reasons I just said.\\n\r\n       Episode 1 was a fantastic episode in my opinion, even though it felt like my dick kept retracting from inside my body most of the times, but that was the whole point. It set the tone incredibly early. It showed us that even though goblins may not look as dangerous, they're actually violent and terrifying creatures. They attack villages,killing farmers and destroying crops, while also kidnapping and raping women so that they can reproduce, and they can become even stronger, turning into hobgoblins, or even a Goblin Lord. It shows a good example on how people depict them as harmless creatures as we saw with the porcelain adventures in the beginning definitely not knowing what they were going to get themselves into. I also got chills sent down my spine when Goblin Slayer first appeared.\\n\r\n      The characters aren't really anything that special in his show, except for Goblin Slayer, who is one of the most badass characters I've seen in an anime. At the same time hes only a silver ranked adventurer, which is only the 3rd highest rank, which means he's not overpowered. I want to actually go into depth about Goblin Slayer himself. The show doesn't really give him a decent backstory, but it gives him an incredibly strong purpose. As a child, he literally watched his sister get raped and murdered by goblins, which makes him develop the most extreme amount of hatred towards something I think I've ever seen. That's all he talks about is killing goblins. He's killed so many for so long that he's gained an incredible amount of knowledge about them, which not only makes him badass, but really entertaining to watch. The way he plans out clearing a goblins nest and all his creative and efficient ways of killing goblins are so fun to watch. Every situation he is put in, no matter how dire it may be, he is always calm and collected. He is the main driving force of this show. \\n\r\n       All in all, once you get past that stuff, this show is a pretty entertaining watch and was actually a breath of fresh air I wouldn't recommend it to just anyone for obvious reasons. On the other hand if you enjoy your dark fantasy and also a huge fan of Berserk, then I highly recommend you give this a watch. It was definitely one of my favorites of Fall 2018 and I definitely cant wait for season 2.\\n",

Goblin Slayer is one of those animes where it extremely dark showing some incredibly harsh and touchy subjects such as rape and genocide just under the setting of dark fantasy, it's gonna be violent and dark is bloody obvious and just sparking controversy in the FIRST episode and calling it a horrible anime because ofwhat it showed is just rushing to conclusions without the audience not looking at the details.\\n\\n\r\nGoblin Slayer's plot shows the titular Goblin Slayer voiced by Yuuichrou Umehara doing what he does best, killing goblins but with an incident with Shinkan Onna voiced by Yui Ogura, she tags along with Goblin Slayer  and soon enough Goblin Slayer and Shinkan Onna gets a whole party to what else...kill goblins.\\n\\n\r\nGoblin Slayer by in large looks at the ramification of the titular Goblin Slayer's hyper focused goals of exterminating goblins due to his own tragic backstory in which he couldn't do anything to stop what is a feeble monster to be actually a menace to society at large and that while the \"heroes\" are out defeating the demon lord, every day people and adventurers still and maybe forever face the dangers of such simple and disgusting monsters like Goblin Slayer's goblins shred their livelihood in a matters of seconds. Goblin Slayer looks at a simple premise of goblin slaying and looks at this D&D-like world into a harsher perspective of things and that adventurers no matter what situation is do or die, while showing that even the most annoying and \"beginner\" type monsters we in RPG's or D&D faces off against, they aren't exactly easy to deal with either. Goblin Slayer has a dark morbid take on it's fantasy genre and it does it not only consistently but follow through with it as well.\\n\\n\r\nGoblin Slayer as much as shows off it's dark and disturbing take on the it's fantasy, it's character development isn't much unfortunately, yes Goblin Slayer himself gets the most focus, it's for sure since he's the titular character as we see how and WHY he became what he became as well as the introspective of what happens in the future for him, but his party members, since they gravitate towards him, they don't really get much development, more banter and the such and their camaraderie growing instead as compensation. As a result we get some wasted potential in some of the party members, especially from Shinkan Onna as we don't really get much insight from her and she more or less bounces off her worries and development to Goblin Slayer. LA's favorite character in the anime goes to Yousei Yunde voiced by Nao Touyama...for obvious reasons *cough* Nao Touyama doing tsundere *cough* but Yousei Yunde is pretty kickass as well as Goblin Slayer's other party members of Tokage Souryo voiced by Tomokazu Sugita the minder of both Kouhito Doushi and Yousei Yunde and the calm stoic type of the party and Kouhito Doushi voiced by Yuuichi Nakamura the boisterous one who always in competition with Yousei Yunde.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation done by White Fox, the animation is very atmospheric from the dungeon crawling to the character designs themselves AND LA needs to get the elephant out fo the room and that is of Goblin Slayer's CGI use, look LA gets trying to hand draw all of Goblin Slayer's armour every time to be hard but the implementation that White Fox did with it doesn't make as seamless as it does making the clash of Goblin Slayer's CGI armour clash with the traditional animation ALOT of times, making the CGI rather janky even though a suit of armour is suppose to be janky but not like this. The animation besides that especially with how brutal and violent this anime is, well it doesn't hold back with blood and gore shown in almost every orifice and though the *ahem* rape are shown in the least gratifying way which was the point the rape for the most part is \"implied\" with even the nudity being low key even for this anime, though on the side of fan disservice. White Fox did decently with the animation all round even with the complaints LA have with the CGI armour use being the biggest complaint, but nonetheless White Fox did well in the animation.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is actually pretty well handled, with Yuuichi Umehara doing a great job as the stoic-hyper focused Goblin Slayer with almost no emotion quite well, Yui Ogura for LA was the greatest surprise showing that Yui Ogura can go outside her archetypal roles. LA loved Nao Touyama as Yousei Yunde with Yuuichi Nakamura having good chemistry with Nao Touyama and as Kouhito Doushi with Tomokazu Sugita was good as the calm minder of the group as Tokage Souryo. Now there are minor cast that is noteworthy, mainly Maaya Uchida as Uketsuke-jou and Yoko Hikasa the strange witch Majo with her strange slow rhythmic cadence she had on her. Goblin Slayer's casting was great and LA outright loved some of the casting choices *cough* Nao Touyama tsundereness *cough*.\\n\\n\r\nIf there were any flaws towards Goblin Slayer, really the major problem is just how hardcore and brazen it is which will quite obviously steer people away one way or another, the other reasoning being is that like Goblin Slayer the character, he like the anime cares ONLY for killing goblins, nothing more, nothing less, BUT to this one's defence, well it's called \"GOBLIN SLAYER\"...your kinda get what it already saying on the tin here, but to it's detriment because the sole focus is on Goblin Slayer's exploits and nothing more than that and LA already mentioned this and that would be that Goblin Slayer's party and people who know Goblin Slayer doesn't get much characterization besides their basic job class and some personality quirks, not so much of a backstory really, not even from Goblin Slayer's party members either which was a shame as LA really wanted to know more of Yousei Yunde outside of Goblin Slayer's goblin slaying party rounds.\\n\\n\r\nGoblin Slayer isn't an anime for everyone for sure, being a very dark fantasy fueled anime in the veins of ReZero but instead of time traveling to undo your mistakes, Goblin Slayers have no redo's and takes the stereotypical D&D and or typical RPG format and takes it in a darker direction and turning simple monsters that we see like goblins and making them much more dangerous than we thought them to be and how one person will forever exterminate them and how he deals with it and how it deals with him, both physically and psychologically for him to do what normal adventurers sees as janitor work, ReZero redo it's mistakes, Goblin Slayer dwells and lives on with it's mistakes. \\n\\n\r\nGoblin Slayer is not only the most controversial anime of Fall 2018 but it is definitely one of those darker fantasy animes that really feels like \"dark and edgy\" and intentionally so to makes it's point which grabbed LA instantly and in all honesty LA actually liked how unabashingly honest in it's dark fantasy concept it is but not taking it's base concept to a higher playing field than the ramifications of one man's goal to eradicate a species that NEEDS to be constantly killed for the sake of humanity and that by all means LA can actually see the concept of it being executed decently well by anime's end. If your not into these kinds of animes, then that's fine, there are plenty of lighter fantasy animes out there, but for those looking for another dark perspective to this kind of genre then have a look but all in all it all comes down it is...\\n\\n\r\nYou get used to it...",

            "content": "This show is graphic and is not for everyone. This is not your typical happy adventure story, and it does a good job showing that in the first episode.\r\nGoblin Slayer is the best anime of 2018, and one of the best that I have ever seen. This is just my opinion, if you disagree that's fine, we are all entitled to our own opinions. \r\nThe show takes place in a fairly standard world of magic and adventure, but the elements that are focused on is what really sets it apart from the rest. Instead of focusing on a 'big bad' (demon lord, lich, enemy kingdom,ect.) it takes a realistic view on what are usually minion enemies or pests. The way in which the goblins are portrayed as vile pests is the most accurate and faithful portray that I have seen. The show does a great job of making you detest these creatures without making them out to be the most dangerous or evil threat to the world. There is a fair amount of graphic material, not only gore but adult themes. The graphic nature of the show is not graphic just for the sake of it or for shock value, rather it is a faithful depiction of the vile creatures that goblins are. \\n\\n\r\nThe magic of the world is that of classic D&D. There is a limit to how many spells you can cast per day and you gain more spells over time through leveling up. This setup allows for magic to be used without making it too powerful and forces the casters to be creative to optimize the effectiveness of its use.\\n\\n\r\nThe main charter, Goblin Slayer, is a well designed charter who goes through a believable and interesting development through out the show. He is not particularly special in any way. He is not powerful because he's a 'chosen one' or because he found a great magic item, in fact he is only extremely effective against goblins.This because he has dedicated his life to studying them and coming up with specific ways to fight them. He pays attention to the world around him and uses whatever he learns to better fight goblins. He is simply a broken man who wishes to kill goblins to prevent what happened to him from happening to others. During the first season he meets others who work with him and through this he begins to heal as a person.\\n\\n\r\nThe introduction of new charters feels natural and flows nicely with the plot. The progression of the story is kept at a good pace with very little filler and a good amount of action. There are new types enemies and situations that keep things interesting without feeling forced. \\n\\n\r\nI have seen many complaints about aesthetics of the show, but I'm not sure why. There are some scenes where bigger more complex creatures are rendered using CGI, but that is something common when trying to make large, complex, and detailed creatures. I agree that these elements still have a way to go to be more seamlessly blended with non CGI elements, but I think it has come far even from just a few years ago. Despite issues with the CGI elements, I quite like the art style of the show.\\n\\n\r\nI think that this show is a wonderful look at enemies that are normally overlooked, with charters that are normal adventures (more or less). The world built in this show is realistic and balanced in respect magic, enemies, and the individual strength of charters. I applaud this show for not shy away from the graphic material naturally stemming from the vile enemies in it, and approaches it in as tasteful a manner possible. The result were charters with believable motivation and enemies that were a real threat.",

            "content": "Goblin Slayer strays away from the usual kinds of shows in its genre. Unlike other action and adventure shows that star reckless main characters who's main shtick revolves around idiocy and wild cards, Goblin Slayer reminds its audience that ignorance and overestimating yourself (or underestimating others) can have adverse side affects. Goblin Slayer illustrates this by displaying the tragic outcomes of those who thought lightly of the low leveled goblins and ended up paying dearly.The show continues to contrast this with a knowledgeable and overall competent protagonist who places great emphasis on even the smallest of details to ensure that tragic outcomes will at leastnot occur from slight mishaps or hubris.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nVery Straightforward. When looking at the show itself and not the message, the show is pretty much about slaying goblins. Pretty simple but definitely a lot better than shows that try too hard to seem deep but then crash and burn. Simple shows like this can't really crash and burn like that if they continue to work off of what the title at least says its about. Enjoyable if you like simple heroic protagonists. In Goblin Slayer, the enemies are pretty much all rapists and Mr. Goblin Cop fines them every episode. Some might find the rape part to be unsettling and that make sense. Though I should remind others still on the fence about watching the show over this is that the show pretty much is about the glorified mass slaughters of the rapists. It is in no way making pleasure off of those scenes as they are both censored and very brutally portrayed and is followed with payback.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nFulfills the standard. What you'd expect but in no way bad. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nAlso pretty standard, but not in a bad way as it delivers what we want. Me personally though, I like the ending song only because I'm familiar with their other songs.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7\\n\r\nThey're pretty generic to be honest. Goblin Slayer is pretty socially unaware because he specializes in something a bit more practically for his lifestyle. Dwarf and Lizard seem like people you'd meet at your local bar. Archer is probably the most generic tsundere though. Priestess/cover girl is generic cute but still cute nonetheless.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nPretty straight forward show, though me personally, I think they still could have portrayed the goblins as evil without the rape scenes. It seems silly and unrealistic that a species has only one sex in it but can't asexually reproduce, kinda like the Asaris. Regardless, I think straightforwardness is a positive trait in anime. Its definitely a breath of fresh air from the other shows  that might try to hard to appear deep but end up flopping over towards the end. Some good ol' hack n' slash simplicity is not bad once in a while\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nIt isn't mathematically correct in terms of the average of the other ratings but I give 10s to anything worth re watching. I recommend this show because it reminds us that the side affects of poor decisions are indiscriminate. It does not matter if you're an old person, a child, or an adolescent of anime protagonist age.  It'll come bite you for even minor oversights. Goblin Slayer tries to tell us that if we come prepared and still fail, at least we can't blame ourselves for things that could not have been prevented.",

            "content": "As someone coming to this anime after having binge read the first 30 chapters of the manga, I can say my initial impression of the adaption was all-in-all a sense of utter disappointment. I read through the first 25 chapters without break and finished the last 5 available after a short intermission, though when faced with the anime I had to take a break after the first episode, and lost almost all interest in this after the second.\r\nTo start of with the manga itself felt like a action/drama filled story delving into both adventures and the dark past of the main character, but with theanime I found the story lacking on both of those fronts. The main character himself jumps between normal animation and CG animation throughout the episodes in an unattractive way, and most of the entertaining action scenes from the manga have either been cut out, shortened, or changed to have the main character using only his bow instead of \"time consuming to edit\" melee-combat that truly exhibited the main character as a well rounded and experienced combatant.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of the inner monologues and conversations between some the the characters meant to help lay out and develop their personalities have been cut out, leaving the characters to be more of lack luster husks of what they were shown as in the manga. Overall a lot of stuff is just omitted, speed up, or watered down in the anime for sake of time, causing the overall pace of the anime to be a lot faster than the manga in a bad way.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of art and sound everything overall is okay, besides for the lazy use or CG in a way that doesn't really show off how good CG can be in the proper hands, as well as some areas where music is put in that overall just DOES NOT fit the dark fantasy atmosphere that this story is supposed to have.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're asking me wether this is something worth watching or not I'd have to say no. Wether you're coming from the manga or watching this without having read it then I'd still have to say that this is overall a waste of your time to watch. If you're seriously interested in the story then read the manga, if you came for good action then look else where because this is riddled with lazy animation from people who are obviously just trying to make easy money and aren't chasing their passion for animation.\\n",

Lots of novels and manga with very graphic content often get toned down a lot once they hit the big screen, for obvious reasons.

Iget that using 3D models is much easier and time efficient than fully drawing and animating the 2D character, it's still gonna cost them the points. \\n\r\nOverall, super pumped for the rest of the season.

            "content": "To begin, I'll state my biases; I love Goblin Slayer. Not the anime, but the Novels and Manga. The anime, which as of today I am dropping, has disgusted me in its handling of the source material. I'll talk more about it later.\r\nLet's talk about the animation, first and foremost. Like always Whitefox is doing a good job with their animation. The hiccup here is Goblin Slayer, who for whatever reason is CG most of the time when he's moving. The animation is bad and it sticks out like a sore thumb because of how it's shaded compared to the rest of the scenery andshow. It pulls you out, but I could ignore it because when it matters he's fully drawn and looks amazing.\\n\\n\r\nFrom here, I talk about the story. The story *WOULD* be great, were it not for the blaring issue I will talk about later. Before we get into potential spoilers, I'll give a basic synopsis; Goblin Slayer slays goblins. It's simple, concise and to the point. The way it should be. He finds other people, and goes to kill goblins. That's it. Why? Because the show skips all the character development that should be there, seemingly taking the title of the novels as the point of the show, and skipping anything that would flesh out the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe music in the show is great, and the sound design is well done. During fights it sounds almost like music out of DOOM, making for an epic murder-fantasy vibe. This is deliberate and well done, exactly the way that I'd have wanted it to go when I was first reading the manga months ago.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime itself should be very enjoyable to anyone coming in completely blind. You wouldn't know the glaring flaws with the story because it skips over it completely as each fight/raid/battle is more or less separated from one another. You could cut out the dozens of inconsequential quests you do in an RPG, for example, and wouldn't lose anything regarding the story and any viewers or people you were telling the story to wouldn't notice or care because you still touched on the important stuff. The important stuff, that the director has so tactlessly decided to scrub from the anime for God knows why.\\n\\n\r\nI don't know if I should call this a spoiler or not, because at this point the anime has completely skipped it but for the sake of those who are completely new to the series I'll be vague about it. The climax of the first volume, which is what is in the first four episodes with the fifth being side-stories from volume 4 that take place during vol.1, is a large-scale battle between the adventurers of the town and an army of goblins. This fight is supposed to be the cumulation of everything Goblin Slayer has done throughout the first volume, building relationships with his party and his work for the guild. It shows how much Guild Girl cares about Goblin Slayer, as she begs the guild to produce a special quest for this event. It shows that Goblin Slayer has things that he cares about, and further develops his motivation. Finally, it acts as the ultimate tone-setter for wider series as a whole, as we see a large clash between silver-ranks and goblins that are equal if not greater in power to them. It is a MASSIVE plot point in the series and while it's not referenced much later (not until vol.3 if I remember correctly) it shows that GS has attachments to the people around him and the world. Why they would skip this is beyond me, but I can't get over it and it caused me to drop the series no more than seven minutes into episode six where they show the start of the next entire volume.\\n\\n\r\nI can't recommend this show, because it treats a story that I genuinely love with irreverence and actively ignores the best aspects of it. If you're interested, skip it and read the manga instead. If you like the manga, read the light novels. While they're not for those with weak constitutions, they are fantastically written and they are among the works that influence my own style of storytelling.",

So they come up with this fake concept of seeming to be dangerous when every move they make is the result of market research and a corporate master plan.\" This description is sardonic, but is nonetheless fitting for Goblin Slayer.\r\nI don't think it even qualifies as a spoiler at this point to mention the pilot features a rape scene. Fair enough, it's an ultra-violent carnage romp like Berserk then, right? Well, no, not in the least. The rest ofthe show is a bog standard fantasy show with absolutely nothing else to surprise the viewer. It's insulting to consider how much controversy swirled around a show literally featuring an ice cream episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe fact of the matter is Goblin Slayer was a bait-and-switch; it attracted a crowd with an edgy first episode only to spend the rest of a bland season trotting around its gimmick of 'he only kills goblins' ad nauseum. The supporting cast range from trying and failing to connect with Mr. Slayer to just being flat and largely ignored. The show even tries to dip its toe into deeper topics like coping with trauma only to shy away to the tune of, you guessed it, 'he only kills goblins.' \\n\\n\r\nDon't watch it.

            "content": "I came to watch Goblin Slayer after the big fallout that the first episode provoked in most of the left wing faction of the anime fandom, only to be disappointed most of the time that I watched an episode of this anime. Some spoilers ahead, you are warned.\r\nStory (6/10):\r\nSimple, a young Priestess goes in a quest to defeat some goblins with an inexperienced party, but reality came to them when the rest of her party is killed and raped, and she's only saved by a mysterious armored man who comes by the name of Goblin Slayer. This single episode is what attracted a lot ofnegativity from the left, criticizing the rape scenes as in we haven't seen it before, let me remind you that a couple of weeks later, SAO Alicization had rape scenes and nobody screamed like a retard and behaved like a snowflake.\\n\\n\r\nThis episode alone and the wasteland that left is what attracted me in order to offer a right-wing counterbalance point of view and to try to defend the show, just to keep me disappointing more and more, because since watching Ep-1, I expected an edgy anime which revolved on gross scenes just for the sake of it and not some generic D&D adventures that was, well, more than 50% of the series. And CR even dared to put a \"trigger warning\" for having \"disturbing scenes\", they should have put a trigger warning cautioning the viewer to not get bored. (Note: I condemn every single act of rape that this show or other ones have, be it fiction or IRL, for the ones who will try to accuse me as a \"rape glorifier\")\\n\\n\r\nWhile Goblin Slayer has its moment of intense gore scenes, like in the city's sewers arc and the final arc with all the adventurers. GS was for the most part a boring anime with no sense of direction nor a high development of the characters' personalities, which I could forgive in an anime without sense of direction, like Lucky Star.\\n\\n\r\nArt (7/10):\\n\r\nWhite Fox is a good studio and worked relatively well with the animation and the design of the characters, the Dwarf and the Lizard are very well designed, so is the Priestess and the High Elf who are very cute and attractive. My only complaint here is the constant use of CG to Goblin Slayer's movement, it feels completely out of sorts and actually hinders the fluid motions of the other characters.\\n\\n\r\nSound (5/10):\\n\r\nThe OP is very mediocre, boring and uninteresting, it doesn't give you the emotions of an Adamas (SAO Alicization), or the false sense of security of Surprise (Asobi Asobase), it's completely forgetable. The ED is slighly better, but it's no Wish me Luck (Harukana Receive) or Koko Kara (Sora Yori).\\n\\n\r\nThe OST is also mediocre, inexistant and doesn't complement the very few interesting scenes that Goblin Slayer had. The seiyuus did a serviceable job to express the mediocrity of the series, Nao Touyama voicing the High Elf was spot on and the way she says Orcbolg is so cute and funny.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (5/10):\\n\r\nGoblin Slayer is a determined man who only specializes on killing goblins, and he does a quite efficient job of it, however, his personality is quite twisted and ridiculous. While I'll mostly defend a person if he chooses to do a job not done by the other people, I won't with GS because he's full of vengeance, while understandable, it's a weak excuse.\\n\\n\r\nThe girls are the Priestess who is a very young girl who works with magic spells and healing spells, she's mostly shy and quiet and mostly goes through the motions, but there's some improvement, not too much to say. The Elf is the only acceptable character as she provides the funny moments, which somehow helped me to not getting more bored than I was, but she is literally a Shino Asada-wannabe (SAO); I won't lie if I say I didn't like when she said \"Orcbolg\"\\n\\n\r\nThe other guys are the Dwarf and the Lizard, both are quite competent when doing the quests and are very helpful of Goblin Slayer, they're not charismatic to earn some praise apart of their efficiency. The rest of the secondary characters are even worse in this point.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (6/10):\\n\r\nWhen I give a note below 7 in something is because there are severe deficiencies in a certain aspect of something. The enjoyment of Goblin Slayer is low if you're coming to see some dark fantasy and constant gore scenes, I for one, who is very sensible to high amounts of blood, feel very disappointed in the way this anime turn out to be.\\n\\n\r\nI joked in a website that Goblin Slayer is the new Darling in the Franxx who is not Darling in the Franxx; the latter had at least some direction, high development in the characters' personalities and had the conservative flair, while the former is boring and repetitive without the hardness and crudeness of DarliFra.\\n\\n\r\nA final parting message is that if Goblin Slayer comes back as the final scene suggests, I hope it's not a repetition of the direction this season had.\\n\\n\r\nFinal score: 6/10.",

            "content": "If you manage to sit through a very unsettling first episode of Goblin Slayer, you will experience a miserable fantasy adventure afterwards. Studio \u201cWhite Fox\u201d usually delivers high quality anime, as a result, I am genuinely baffled, how little enjoyment I found in this particular project. \r\nAt least for me, manga created the impression, that Goblin Slayer is an imitation of a D&D board game, with focus on witty battle strategies as well as amusing squad chemistry in an unforgiving harsh fantasy world with lore elements sprinkled across many (missing) dialogues. Not so much fan service and gore feast. \r\nSCORE: Bad \u2013 3.\r\nSTORY: Will fiton a dirty napkin.\\n\r\nGoblin Slayer\u2019s overall story is quite simple, almost nonexistent \u2013 it presents more or less isolated adventures and goblin exterminations. Relentless pacing propels already shallow narrative from one goblin cave to another, ignoring world building or character interactions. Pacing and resources are mismanaged to the point, that there is a recap after only 10 episodes and it starts with a booty shot. Priorities on display. \\n\r\nThe only praise I can give is ep10 finale, because it was built in small steps from early on and utilizes deceitfully peaceful atmosphere presented in said episode. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: A tin can, a lizard, a dwarf & an elf walk into a cave\u2026\\n\r\nGoblin Slayer, titular main character, is a walking robot, with limited vocabulary and range of emotions. The show tries to portray him as a badass goblin apocalypse; with emphasis on \u201ctries\u201d. He is followed by just as faceless lizard, dwarf and an elf. Young human girl with PTSD and weak bladder is the most vivid caricature in this squad. \\n\r\nWith the exception of a bonfire talk in ep3 and some moments in ep10, squad interactions are limited to slaying goblins. Characters cannot develop and shine in such constrained environment. In addition, the concept of a nameless world did not transfer well into anime.\\n\\n\r\nART & ANIMATION: If you do not have the budget, do not work on challenging projects.\\n\r\nCharacter designs are detailed and mostly on model; backgrounds often consist of dark caves or ruins and are interchangeable. Visuals are basic, but functional.\\n\r\nAction scenes are barely animated, like most of the show, with the exception of boobs. Brawls with goblins lack impact or excitement, because they often consist of static \u201cBOOM\u201d or \u201cSLASH\u201d images as well as overabundance of blood fountains in slow motion. The emphasis on witty strategies, preparation and teamplay to be victorious on the battlefield are not integral to the show. To save even more money, on every opportunity Mr. Slayer or goblins themselves are replaced with eye-catching CGI. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND: Devastating. \\n\r\nOST is bland and forgettable. \\n\r\nSlayer never shows his face to the audience, thus his voice actor had a difficult task to capture and express emotions to make the character appealing. This emotionless tin can performance radiates no charisma, rather reluctance. The \u201crequest\u201d scene in ep12 was particularly underwhelming.\\n\r\nLizard and mage sound interesting and project at least some personality, everyone else is unremarkable.  \\n\\n\r\nGoblin Slayer the anime is a disappointment. In an unlikely case of interest, I would suggest to read the manga. If it has to be an anime with a gritty fantasy setting, goblins and a proper squad chemistry \u201cHai to Gensou no Grimgar\u201d could be an alternative. \\n",

            "content": "Goblin Slayer is a show the relies PURELY on shock value. The start of the show got TONS of media attention because it was a PG-rated show with non-PG attributes. The entire show itself is basically one huge hype train that leads\u2026.. I really don\u2019t know, somewhere? There\u2019s no real end goal besides \u201cthe extermination of all goblins\u201d but that\u2019s really it.\r\nTL;DR \r\nIt\u2019s a HUGE hit-or-miss show, either you\u2019re going to make it through the first episode or you\u2019re going to drop it. However, if you make it through you\u2019ll be rewarded with an endless cliffhanger reminiscent of shows that have a LOT more episodes.\r\nStory7: From what I can understand you\u2019re not getting anything groundbreaking in the story department. (However, the show is called Goblin Slayer so you WILL get goblin slaying)\\n\\n\r\nLike I said before the entire show is highly dependent on shock value, something crazy happens and the show tries its best to make the viewer feel some sort of fear for the well being of all the characters\u2026 That\u2019s it, there\u2019s no real narrative or goal it's just random events that all relate to goblin slaying and that\u2019s it. That\u2019s literally the entire show, it\u2019s not bad because they don\u2019t expect you to know anything but people who only want stories are going to be SORELY disappointed. \\n\\n\r\nArt 7: CGI\\n\\n\r\nNot nearly as bad as Berserker and has several well-animated scenes.The first episode gives a VERY bad impression on how CGI is used throughout the series, but I despise  CGI no matter where it is. Other than that, a lot of the fight scenes are badass, Goblin Slayer will just run around slicing through goblins, throw his sword, and just continue on the fight with a club like nothing happens. At these moments the show is near perfect, it\u2019s great as long as it lasts but all good things much end and when the combat scenes end the animation quality DROPS.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9: Heavy Metal reminiscent of Doom\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and closing are all great, that\u2019s enough to give it a 9 despite the rest of the track being mediocre.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8: Nothing much individually but sometimes it feels like the entire cast just clicks and they seem like a genuine party.\\n\\n\r\nYou have your traumatized MC who does whatever it takes to kill all the (Insert random monster) he sees because they killed their family which is what we see in a lot of shows. However, something that the show tries to convey is that Goblin Slayer is not some unkillable god-like monster who could obliterate you by looking at you, in fact, he\u2019s not strong at all he\u2019s creative. \\n\\n\r\nYou have your Priest character who owes her life to GS because he saved her in a cave, you have your childhood friend who harbors feelings for the MC, you elf girl she meets because she-- HEY WAIT A SECOND! This is a harem anime! Or it WOULD be if he was even remotely interested in anything except killing goblins. I would say it was kind of annoying but in the sea of mentally retarded main characters, this is actually a breath of fresh air.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10: Maybe I\u2019m still reminiscing about playing Doom for three hours straight every day, but when the action picks up, the show gets AMAZING. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 8: WARNING! JUST LIKE ALL SHOWS IN EXISTENCE, THIS SHOW IS NOT FOR EVERYONE! \\n\\n\r\nThis show is exclusively for action fans who don\u2019t really care about the story\\n\\n\r\nI guess\\n\\n",

            "content": "Please note this review is intended to be read by those that have finished watching Goblin Slayer and while care has been taken to minimize story related spoilers there may still be spoilers within character analysis. You have been warned. \r\nBased off a popular light novel of the same name Goblin Slayer is a action, adventure and dark fantasy anime that gives us the opportunity to see what will happen if a rookie adventurer embarking on her first ever adventure were to not just encounter the grim fatal reality that comes from being an adventurer but also realize that to be successful in this roleshe must not only dispel all of the misconceptions that she has so far believed but also learn that out on the frontier in this grim world adaptability, teamwork and a desire to learn new tactics and strategy is what would ensure that she and her comrades will be able to return to the guild after a successful mission. Though animes that make use of fantasy worlds are relatively common within the world of anime I would say that animes that make use of the dark fantasy setting as its main setting is a rare one and in fact, this one is perhaps the first example, I saw of one. This usage of a such a grim setting where every creature that the adventurers encounter can potentially cut short their careers if they underestimate them, I thought was an interesting one as it ensured that each of the fights that the adventurers encounter in the story to be that much more dangerous and brutal. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall story of Goblin Slayer takes place in a rather grim fantasy world where the various races that inhabit the world that includes humans, dwarves, lizardmen, and elves live in constant fear of attacks from the many hostile races that share their world with them. These threats to their wellbeing include the infamous demon lords, ogre\u2019s, giant rats and finally the titular villain of the series which is the goblin race. In this grim world where death can literally come from any quarter there are however many brave individuals who though coming from all walks of life and having many different kinds of motivations all have one thing in common which is a desire to explore the land and live a life that\u2019s full of adventure as they go from place to place fulfilling quests. These people are the adventurer\u2019s people who are not just brave enough to explore the frontier and take on difficult quests from the guild but also brave enough to face the many hostile creatures that inhabit the darkest shadows of the land. However, for every successful quest that is completed, there are also many quests that will see many a party of adventurers wiped out. \\n\\n\r\nAfter priestess, a rookie adventure\u2019s party is wiped out by goblins during their attempted completion of what was supposed to be an easy mission Priestess fully expects the same fate to befall her, but she is saved by the timely intervention of a veteran adventurer who had been tracking the goblins coincidently. Despite the trauma that she had sustained the Priestess still determined to live her life as an adventurer where she can help protect the people across the land and help alleviate the sense of dread that they get from seeing the horrors that inhabit the land decides to team up with the veteran adventurer that had saved her life the Goblin slayer and having seen the threat posed by the goblins assist him in hunting down goblins across the land and stop them from committing the same actions that had so scarred the both of them. Joining them in this quest of vengeance and adventure are a host of characters that include the confident and prideful Elf archer, the kind and attentive Jou and the perceptive and wise sword maiden. \\n\\n\r\nAs the priestess and her comrades embark on their adventure she will find that through the world outside of the towns may be grim and that they may face powerful enemies as long as she and the party fight creatively and learn to bond with each other and form friendships with each other no matter what quest they take and what foe they face they will succeed and be able to hand in their quest back at the guild and end each day with a victory by surviving another day in this grim and dark world. \\n\\n\r\nPriestess \\n\\n\r\nPriestess portrayed by veteran seiyuu singer Yui Ogura of Kamisama no Memochou and Vivid Strike fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main heroine of the series. A 15-year-old girl and a rookie adventurer at the start of the series Priestess on initial appearances can be seen to be a quiet, intelligent and calm person by nature that prefers to be cautious and act only when she has gathered all necessary information. A perceptive person by nature Priestess in the beginning of the series as a result of her new role was shown to be someone that was easily scared and when paired with her quiet nature made it easy for others to intimidate her which is shown well in the first interactions with her first party. While Priestess was shown to be a knowledgeable person, she often displayed hesitation in providing that knowledge to others as a result of her desire to not cause others too much bother and hinder the party\u2019s progress a fact that unfortunately played a role in causing the destruction of the first party that she was part of. \\n\\n\r\nAfter Priestess was saved by the Goblin slayer her personality gradually starts to change as she overcomes the shock and trauma that befell her in the aftermath of her first battle. While still retaining her cautious nature Priestess gradually starts to overcome her quiet and timid nature and becomes more willing to speak up and present her own opinions and feelings to others. At the same time Priestess also begins to show the friendly and caring side to her personality that she had kept hidden previously taking great care to try and forge bonds and friendships with both the Goblin Slayer and later the other members of the party in an effort to both know them on a personal level and at the same time get to know how their weaponry and skills can be best used in battle. One of the notable examples of this change within her was Priestess\u2019s constant attempts to try and teach the Goblin Slayer how basic human interactions work which while amusing was proof of the determined attempts of priestess to not let what happened to her first party happen a second time. While still indecisive at times as the series goes on and the party encounters and fights many fearsome foes Priestess gradually becomes braver and more determined to both protect her new comrades and to ensure that they will be able to complete each of their assigned quests and return home safely after each adventure. While seen in the beginning to be somewhat intimidated by the Goblin slayer as the series goes on it can be seen that the Priestess forms a strong emotional bond with him that can be said to be the very foundation of her being and is something that is able to give her the motivation that she needs to fight alongside him on the frontlines. However, it can be said that this is a double-edged sword of sorts as seeing him get hurt or perceiving that he will leave her will have the opposite effect of causing her to worry more about him. As a character, I felt that Priestess was one that was both well designed and developed. While the trauma that she suffered from seeing her first party get wiped out by goblins was no doubt traumatic I felt that her overcoming of that sad event by using her newly developed bond with the Goblin slayer as a foundation from which she can change herself was something that I thought was done well. Seeing the priestess evolve from a quiet and indecisive person to one that was not just brave but also willing to state her own views freely while adapting to the changing nature of the frontlines was a change that I really enjoyed seeing. One of the things that I found to be most endearing about the character of Priestess was her attempts to change the Goblin Slayers personality a fact that while certainly amusing also served well to show the level of trust that she has developed in him and at the same time visible proof of the growing affection that she has for him. \\n\\n\r\nGoblin Slayer \\n\\n\r\nGoblin Slayer portrayed by veteran voice actor Yuuichirou Umehara of Amanchu and Darling in the Franxx fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. A veteran adventurer of the guild with the rank of a silver ranked adventurer Goblin Slayer at the beginning of the series was seen to be a quiet, gruff but brave person who rather than embark on adventures with either a partner or a party instead strives to take on missions\u2019 solo. While often seen as difficult to approach by many which isn\u2019t helped by the fact that Goblin Slayer tries hard to avoid interacting with others much it can be seen that beneath this Goblin Slayer can be surprisingly kind to others and display a certain level of intelligence that can surprise many. Though seen as a rather direct person by nature it can also be seen that Goblin Slayer is also a responsible and dutiful person who always tries his hardest to complete the quests that were assigned to him. Due in part to his desire to remain isolated from others in the beginning of the series Goblin Slayer was noted to not be very good at working with others and while he can give them simple orders his desire to not let strong emotions cloud his judgment made it hard for him to work with the Priestess at first. This desire to not let emotions cloud his judgment is shown well in the realist attitude that he takes when presented with grim reports for he always expects the worst when the facts are made known to him. However while quiet and preferring to keep his own counsel, in the beginning, it can be seen that Goblin Slayer while possessing no talent for inspirational speeches and the like is a surprisingly attentive listener which when combined by his honest and direct nature makes him very good at providing advice to others. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series goes on however and as Goblin Slayer not just encounters but also befriends and teams up with other adventurers his personality gradually starts to change. As a result of the long periods of time that he spent on solo missions, Goblin Slayer was noted early on to have learned many unique knowledge and tactics that proved to be just as effective when used by a party as it was by himself. While Goblin Slayers nature, in the beginning, worked against him this gradually began to change as he began to fight alongside the others and in the process learn both the value of teamwork but also of the value of having someone that you trust watching your back a feeling that until now was utterly alien to him. As a result, while still retaining his quiet nature Goblin Slayer also began to show more care and consideration towards the well being of his allies and gradually beginning to open his heart to them. This is best shown in his willingness to not just listen to their own thoughts and advice on the various situations that the party encounters in the field but also in his willingness to not just trust them to guard his back but also in running missions independent of him. While mainly seen as a fighter within the series it can be seen rather surprisingly that Goblin Slayer can also be a surprisingly capable commander as well that when used in combination with the increased bond and trust that has been formed between the members of the party and his extensive knowledge of combat that he gained from years of solo adventuring can pull of some impressively creative tactics that serve well to even out the odds that are all too often arrayed against them. This is shown well in the myriad number of fights and traps that the party manages to overcome over the course of the series. The character of the Goblin Slayer I felt was an interesting character that though shaped by the tragic circumstance of his childhood trauma he not only endured but took on a role where he can exact his revenge on the race that had caused him so much pain. The development of Goblin Slayer from someone that preferred to stay apart from others and wage a solo struggle against the goblins to someone who not just found the warmth and friendship that was unique to parties but also the advantages that it can bring to him whether on a professional level or a personal level was a change that I really enjoyed seeing within him. Indeed one event that I felt showed this development of this well enough was the event in which Goblin Slayer had food with not just the members of his party but also with the friends that have proved dear to him in life. \\n\\n\r\nHigh Elf Archer \\n\\n\r\nHigh Elf archer portrayed by veteran seiyuu singer Nao Touyama of Beatless and Asterisk Wars fame is one of the main supporting characters of the series and is one of Goblin Slayers fellow party members within the series. A member of the long-lived elf race High Elf archer at the beginning of the series was seen to be a confident and haughty person by nature that as a result had great difficulty in asking others for help despite the initial reason for her and her parties\u2019 reason for seeking out the Goblin Slayer. As a result of this nature, High Elf archer was seen to be someone that looked down on others and was someone that defended herself fiercely from the comments made by others in response by having a retort ready at all times. However, despite her self-confidence and haughty nature High Elf archer was also shown to display a playful and teasing nature at times willing to make jokes at odd moments at times that serve well to alleviate some of the tension that came about from her first interactions with Goblin Slayer and company. Despite the long years that Elf\u2019s are known to live for it can be seen that High Elf archer is someone that lacks any real experience both in terms of being an adventurer and also in dealing with races other than her fellows. As a result of this inexperience, she can be seen to be curious towards the nature of the world around her which is shown well in how she reacts when she encounters situations that she has yet to encounter in her life. At the same time, however, she was also seen to be ignorant of the basic tactics that adventures should be using when in the field such as using monster blood to help mask their scent skills that would have been second nature to adventurers. Indeed, while lacking any sort of experience as an adventurer it can be seen that High Elf archer has a rather lofty idea of the adventures that adventurers actually go on when they depart for quests which from her impression seems to be one that\u2019s filled with fun and laughter rather than the grim and brutal battles that are instead the norm of such lives. Despite her prideful and confident nature however High Elf archer is shown to be a formidable combatant being not just a capable archer but also an effective tracker as well. Unlike her default personality in combat, she was shown to be calm, logical and made great use of her pride as a source of strength a contrast that I felt showed that despite her inexperience as both an adventurer and a person she was willing to work hard to learn and improve herself. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series goes on however and as High Elf archer gets to understand the kind of life that adventures actually lead as well as learn to appreciate the types of bonds and teamwork that can come from working effectively with others her personality starts to gradually change. At the beginning of the series, High Elf archer was noted to not have a very good relationship with Goblin slayer due mostly to the fact that he wore low-grade gear and was seemingly focused on fighting goblins which she regarded as low tier foes. However, as the series went on and she got to see the true reality of the threat that was posed by the goblins and the solo war that Goblin Slayer had been waging against them this sense of dislike eventually evolved to that of respect and eventually trust. This is shown well in the fact that she was willing to let him dictate the kind of tactics and strategy that would be used in the many battles that the party faces in their journey. While still possessing the strong pride that defines her character as she learns more about the members of the party and how things work in this world High Elf archer\u2019s attitude gradually matures becoming friendlier, kinder and more considerate of the feeling of others especially to those that has earned her trust. While no longer letting pride dictate her actions it can be seen that she doesn\u2019t discard it entirely as she uses it instead as a source of motivation that she uses to interact better with her party members and improve not just the relationship that she has with them but also their effectiveness as a party as well. Perhaps the greatest change that came from this change in her character was the kind of interactions that she has with Goblin Slayer as in addition to being kinder to him she also began to show a softer side to him as well that showed not just consideration but also a playful and teasing nature as she tried to learn about him a change that I found refreshing. \\n\\n\r\nGuild Girl \\n\\n\r\nGuild girl portrayed by veteran seiyuu singer Maaya Uchida of Charlotte and Killing Bites fame is one of the main support characters of the series and is one of Goblin Slayer\u2019s allies within the series. A member of the adventures guild that works as one of their receptionists Guild girl on initial appearances is seen to be a kind, caring and polite person by nature that tries hard to present a friendly face to the many adventurers that are based within the town. While a kind person by nature Guild Girl is also shown to be an attentive and helpful person and tries her best to help the adventurers that use the guild as their base. While seen as professional and dutiful to her role as the public face of the guild it can be seen that beneath her smile Guild girl is someone that can be seen to be empathic to both the grief that adventurers may encounter when out on the field as well as feelings that the victims of the crimes that are dealt against them by the creatures of darkness. As a result of this unique ability to understand the types of feelings that are carried by others that they try to hide beneath the surface she unlike the rest of the guild can be seen to display more sense of caution in her dealings with the adventurers that she manages and while knowing that she may be sending them to their deaths for every quest that she dispatches them on she at least tries to provide them with the best advice and intel that she can find before doing so. This sense of trying to ensure that her charges not just have a chance of surviving their first forays into the cruel world into which they live despite the fact that she was supposed to maintain a professional relationship between them I felt was a trait that suited her personality pretty well as it highlighted the fact that while she knew how grim the world outside was in her own way she was also trying to ensure that the light that is the adventurers will have a higher chance of surviving their missions and thus aid in making the world a better place. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the more curious aspects of Guild girl\u2019s character is arguably the relationship that exists between her and the Goblin Slayer. Unlike the rest of the adventurer\u2019s guild who show nothing but disdain for him, it can be seen that contrary to the others Guild girl instead is someone that treats him with both kindness and care and indeed is shown to have a lot of respect for him that seems genuine. From looking at the empathic nature that serves as the Guild girls most prominent trait it can be seen that this sense of respect is borne out of the gratitude that she feels for him taking on quests that will not just protect the people from threats that most other adventurers would not handle but at the same time help ensure that rookie adventurers would not meet a grim fate when facing the goblins that are more cunning and powerful than others give them credit for. While showing him genuine respect and treating him as a valued comrade it can be seen that Guild girls\u2019 feelings towards the Goblin Slayer is above that of a professional level and indeed is more akin to that of a friend than anything. This is shown in the display of various strong feelings that she shows when she sees him return whether its displays of joy when she sees him return unharmed and the display of dismay when she sees and hears that he \u2018s been injured. This is reinforced by the fact that she\u2019s willing to use her authority to force him to take more care in his quests by using the threat of not giving him quests to intimidate him which while amusing perhaps hints that she desires something more from him. \\n\\n\r\nSword Maiden \\n\\n\r\nSword Maiden portrayed by veteran seiyuu Aya Endou of Accel World and Comic Girls fame is one of the main support characters of the series and is one of Goblin Slayers main allies within the series. A former gold ranked adventurer and presently the Archbishop of the church of water city Sword Maiden on initial appearances is seen to be a kind, considerate and caring person by nature whose persona as presented to the world is seen by many to be the ideal image of what a respected hero should be like. A calm and composed person by nature Sword Maiden despite her blindness is shown to be both perceptive and wise able to offer surprisingly wise advice to the people that she encounters as part of her duties. However, despite this nature of hers, it can be seen that Sword Maiden can also display a certain level of cunning within her that she uses to create plans when discretion is needed something that I felt was quite surprising given her calling. \\n\\n\r\nDespite her calm and composed nature however, it can be seen Sword Maiden can also be seen to have a more innocent side to her personality as she can also be playful and teasing to others when needed which is shown well in the aftermath of the miracle that she performed on Goblin Slayer that ended up saving his life. As a result of being seen as one of the most powerful adventurers that the land has ever produced its perhaps unsurprising that even as a member of the church that Sword-Maiden is held in high regard by people across the land. As a result of this Sword Maiden can be seen to need to project to others a certain level of calmness and a level of mental strength that someone of her skill and rank would be expected to have. However, while certainly appearing to be mentally strong on the surface beneath this it can be seen that Sword Maiden\u2019s mental state is actually quite fragile. As a result of both her role as an archbishop of the church and her status as a former high ranked adventurer Sword Maiden can be seen to be under a lot of pressure that had the side effect of preventing her from telling others of both her inner thoughts as well as the secret fears that she has inside her. Due to this despite appearing to have everything that most people would want be it rank or power it can be seen that she\u2019s also somewhat lonely as well. However, after meeting Goblin Slayer this changed for while Goblin slayer was not the best of conversationalist\u2019s he at least understood the pain that she had been hiding within her as a result of their shared experiences and due to his nature can be said to be the person that she had so desired to meet for a long time. While this meeting did not affect Sword Maiden\u2019s surface personality much the effects that it had on her mental state however was significant as for the first time, she was able to tell others the pain and fear that she had been hiding within her and in the process managing to find someone that she can rely on. The character of Sword Maiden I felt was an interesting one and while she was only featured within the series for a short time the effect that she had on the cast was significant. The insight into Sword Maiden\u2019s mental state I felt was an interesting one and while seeing her gradually come to grips with her inner struggles by revealing them to the Goblin slayer managed to add more depth to her character I also felt that this aspect also allowed us to understand that in addition to physical pain that adventures can suffer they can also suffer mental trauma that they can be secretly struggling with. \\n\\n\r\nAMV \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animations, I thought that the series animation was pretty well done and that it did a great job of showing the kinds of terrain types and locations that can exist in a world that makes use of the dark fantasy setting and was noted to have quite the variety of locations. The contrast between these locations from the various ruins and caves that the party visit to the farm and the town that houses the guild I felt took great advantage of this fact.  The character designs of the series whether in terms of character designs for the main characters and their allies I thought were pretty done with each character\u2019s outfits and weapons doing a good job of showing the kind of roles that they have both in combat and as adventurers. The combat animation within the series I felt was pretty smooth and did a great job of showing the brutal and gritty nature of the fights that can take place between adventurers and monsters. This was helped greatly by the well designed and developed fights that the cast find themselves in as they go about their adventures. Noteworthy ones that I particularly enjoyed was the fight against the ogre and the siege in the sewers that pitted the party against a sustained attack by a large goblin host that was led by a goblin champion. The enemy designs I felt was also something that was impressive and while individual lower ranked goblins didn\u2019t have many variations, I felt that the design for the larger and more intelligent goblins like the goblin champion, pirate goblin and the design for the ogre were definitely on point as they showed just how powerful and monstrous the creatures of darkness can be. \\n\\n\r\nMusic wise the series made use of one opening and ending theme which was Rightfully that was performed by Mili and Gin No Kisei that was performed by Soraru. Both of these songs I felt contrasted well with each other with the opening being hauntingly beautiful and the ending being dramatic. The series OST I felt was a solid one and did well to complement the various kinds of situations that the party encounters when they are out fulfilling missions. In terms of voice acting, I felt that the series voice cast all did an excellent job at portraying their assigned characters whether main ones or support ones. In particular, I feel that Yui Ogura, Yuuichirou Umehara, Nao Touyama, Maaya Uchida and Aya Endou deserve special praise as I felt that they managed to an excellent job in portraying the characters of Priestess, Goblin Slayer, High Elf archer, Guild girl and Sword Maiden respectively. In addition, while I didn\u2019t cover them within the review, I also felt that Yuka Iguchi, Tomokazu Sugita and Yuuichi Nakamura who portrayed the characters of Musume, lizard priest and the dwarf shaman all did an excellent job in portraying their assigned characters. \\n\\n\r\nOverall conclusion \\n\\n\r\nOverall Goblin Slayer was an anime that I really enjoyed with its main strengths, in my opinion, being its interesting premise, a unique setting that\u2019s seldom seen in anime, strong and well-developed characters, well designed and developed fights that showed the harsh realities of life as an adventurer and strong voice acting from a capable voice cast. \\n\\n\r\nThe series overall premise which is the depiction of the kind of challenges and risks that people who chose to become adventurers can be expected to encounter as they take up that role and make the job of being an adventurer the path that they will follow until death claims them is without a doubt one of the main highlights of this series. While the premise is certainly a dark one and within some circles a deeply controversial one due to the myriad number of fates that can befell such people I felt that the premise that combined the enthusiasm and hopes that rookie adventurers have for having taken up a job that can earn them great riches with the harsh realities of the types of fearsome creatures that they have to face on a daily basis when out on quests contrasted well with each other.  However while certainly grim this premise also did well in highlighting the fact that only those who are willing to endure and learn to overcome their fear of the unknown and learn to hone the skills that are unique to their jobs and work as part of a team can hope to survive and earn the riches and titles that comes from being able to both take on and vanquish the most dangerous of monsters. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall story of the series I felt made great use of this grim premise by showing not just how a rookie adventurer who was saved from certain death was to not just grow in strength as both a person and an adventurer but in the process learn that while the world around them might be a grim one and that death may await them behind every corner as long as they were able to stay motivated, keep their fear in check, learn to bond with and develop friendships with another and more importantly learn to place your trust in one another then the chances of an adventurer and his party not just surviving the missions and adventures that they embark on but also learn to work as a well-oiled party will become exponentially higher. Seeing both the Goblin Slayer and the priestess gradually bond with their fellow party members and learn to trust each other as they embark on multiple hard missions that will pit them against countless powerful creatures of darkness and see the effects that this has on the teamwork of the party while doing well in showing the growth of each member also proved that with trust, friendship and creative use of strategy no matter how grim the situation is they can fight and win against any threat their comes their way. This act of seeing the party members not just overcome their initial mistrust but also learn to trust and fight together and, in the process, discovering the hidden strength that comes from being with your comrades was something that I really enjoyed seeing within the series. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Goblin Slayer was an anime that while darker and grittier than I expected it to be was still one that I really enjoyed as it showed that no matter how grim a world is and how much the odds are stacked against you as long as you have friends and comrades that you can place your trust in to not just watch your back but also fight alongside you a party no matter how inexperienced they are can learn to not just excel in their roles as adventurers but also stand as a bulwark that protects the people that are dear to them from the predations of the creatures of darkness. As a final score, I would say that Goblin Slayer easily deserves a final score of 8/10. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

The ones that hated it say it\u2019s a trash anime that deserves an award for the worst anime of the season. The ones that loved it say it\u2019s an outstanding masterpiece that brought a bit of a fresh air to the repetitive concept of \u201ccute girls in sexy outfits\u201d animes. I personally belong in the latter group as I\u2019ve enjoyed Goblin Slayer very much. It might be true that this anime doesn\u2019t really have a plot, since it\u2019s just about killing goblins all the time, and mostof the characters don\u2019t have much of a personality or backstory, but it still has this hidden charm that you either find while watching the anime or you simply don\u2019t. And that\u2019s how you choose in which of those two groups you belong. It\u2019s all about finding that \u201chidden meaning\u201d xD. Long story short, you just have to watch GS and see for yourself, whether you\u2019ll like it or not.",

            "content": "Goblin Slayer, one of the most controversial animes of not just the season but of the year. But does it deserve all the flak it gets? I will say this right here that the amount of Goblin rape mentioned and used is unnecessary, I can understand mentioning it once or twice in the middle of the show would be acceptable but to start the first episode with what is basically a rape scene is confusing to the audience. This show is like a tale of two tapes. The side of brutal goblin slaying and the threats they pose, and the lightheartedness of a broken manas his friends try to fix him. Overall Goblin Slayer is a show that can be enjoyed by a mass audience but is scrutinized for its few mistakes that carry heavy burden. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation (9/10): I don't have much to say here, I rather like Goblin Slayer\u2019s animation. I dock a point for its sometimes shotty CGI but over then that I enjoy it. Characters are given lifelike faces and bodies and even the fantasy beasts are shown in a way that gives them a real look. And when the mood changes to a more comedic effect the faces are used to perfection. Animation is not something that takes away from the show. \\n\\n\r\nMusic/Voice Acting (7-8/10): I am kinda mixed here, the music is okay but it doesn't add anything to the show. But if it doesn't add or take away then I guess it's more of a neutral factor. Voice acting wise is more annoying. I rather like the dub because it seems to give Goblin Slayer more emotion than his more deadpan Japanese counterpart. However, and yes I know it's not the shows fault, its use of lesser known voice actors in the dub takes away the potential it could of had. In both cases the voice acting does enough to not take away from the show but doesnt give it that memorable feel. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8/10): They may not be the most original characters but I enjoy them. The stereotypical ness of them I think adds to the show and allows them to mesh well. Goblin slayer is only abnormal as he would often be the mindless brute but instead is the strategic brute. Then the mix of Elf, Dwarf, Lizardman and Priestess blend well enough to give it a ragtag family feel. It could be personally preference but I find Elf Ranger the best as she gives a comedic and more realistic response to Goblin Slayer\u2019s actions, while the rest, with some exceptions for Priestess, more or less go along with his plans. While most won't be life changing favorite characters, unless you like huge boobs or stubborn flat girls, the characters blend well together. \\n\\n\r\nPlot (6/10): Goblin Slayer\u2019s plot is a sticky situation. While not so much overarching, besides maybe changing Goblin Slayer, the 2-3 episode plots are rather interesting and often provide new world and character development. Even the subplot about the hero killing the demon world adds to the story without taking it off its course to much. But to be really critical the amount of rape in this takes away a good chunk of points. Like I said before a few mentions to set the threat would of been fine, but its like every other episode they want to mention or show that Goblins are horny little things. It honestly gets annoying and gross, to the shows credit after the first episode it more mentions then shows it happening, with a couple exceptions, which at least doesn't have its viewers watching Goblin rape for a quarter of the episode. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (8.5/10): Minus Goblin rape scenes I loved watching this show. The lighthearted comedic moments were enough to make me laugh while the brutal actions scenes filled a excellent mix of brutal violence and strategy. If it wasn't for the holidays I would have watched the whole series in the 4-5 hours it would take, I really can't think of much more to say here besides don\u2019t let the negative opinions of this show stop you from seeing it for yourself. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10): Goblin Slayer deserves a lot more praise then it gets. Looking at it from a far it might seem like a stupid show but it is the opposite. Goblin Slayer won't teach you some important lesson or make you cry. But it will make a fun watch that will fill a adrenaline and comedic need. This show will stick in my memory and I only hope it gets more seasons so I can enjoy the glory that is Goblin Slayer. Hopefully with a lot less Goblin Rape. \\n",

All the same that doesn't mean this show doesn't eat donkey dick. \r\nI love Taco Bell and eat there like four times a week, but I would never, ever in my life eat a crunchwrap supreme and tell you with a straight face that I just had a quality meal. \r\nGS stands in opposition to typical fantasy genre. Indeed, Goblin Slayer is about Goblin Slayer slaying goblins. I like that it doesn't pretend to be anything other than that, but that in itself doesn't make it a good anime--in fact it implies the opposite. It's like when youtry to crack a joke in middle school, but no one laughs. When someone calls you out, you hit them with, \"It wasn't supposed to be funny!\"\\n\\n\r\nThis show is driven by sensitivities. In fact, PTSD is like the only thing motivating GS and happens to also be the only remotely interesting thing about this show, but that horse not only gets beaten to death, it gets raped, stabbed, gangbanged, poisoned, humiliated, spit-roasted, then chained up in a dark dungeon somewhere.\\n\\n\r\nGoblins are bad because they do all the aforementioned shit. This isn't some clever allegory speaking to the monstrosities committed by humans. Nope. In this show, goblins are literally the only creatures doing evil. Humans=good. Goblins=bad.\\n\\n\r\nNothing about this show boasts any depth extending past the distance covered by a wart-covered goblin dick. Calling it graphic content implies that it had content to begin with. It's hentai but with worse writing and more censorship. \\n\\n\r\nGoblin Slayer is a drive-thru soft taco in a gordita wrapper and not only did they forget to give you sauce, goblins took turns fucking your food.",

If you are accustomed to gore, this show may be to your liking. However, if you can't handle the idea of rape or seeing an animation suggesting it, this may not be your cup of tea. \r\nWhile all the other characters treat the world like a fantasy, Goblin Slayer accepts the harsh realities and acts efficiently. The main character is static which may not be to everyone's liking. However, the anime does well to flesh out how narrow minded Goblin Slayer's character is with his singlepurpose. This characterization helps us see the true state of their world rather than the superficial adventure that most seek; his narrow view is more eye-opening than the just-for-fun adventurers. Like a knight, GS strictly performs his actions and does nothing without reason. As the story progresses, GS's view of the world seeps into the eyes of his companions and those who have fallen victim to the monsters. It's kill or be killed. The naive quickly become enlightened to the harsh reality as their closest companions are torn apart, their blood splattering  as they're beaten in despair. The cold gripping truth shows no sympathy to anyone. To survive in such a cold world, one must be cold as well.",

Yes that's not always the case, not all female characters meet such fate, but the ones that do sometimes they're saved like your typical damsel, or they survived on their own, or perhaps they didn't make it.  It is satisfying to see a waifu getting saved though. Yes, I really hate when both inreal action and in animations when they kill the waifus, but my guess Is; this Anime is not popular because it's considered to be offensive.\\n\\n\r\nI believe, that's because the Protagonist, Goblin Slayer a.k.a. Orcbolg and Beard-Cutter has rather very simple character development approach. You know his backstory, his family members are brutally killed by goblins, and when he grows up he unleashes complete carnage upon those wretched demonic spawns. He knows everything about them, he is stalking them and kills these critters.\\n\\n\r\nDoes this character reminds you of the Doom Guy? He has never said any word, he wears space combat armor and kills demons in mars, and the public just loves him. Similar story here with Goblin Slayer.\\n\\n\r\nDespite being a stoic and extremely modest personality, that displays a significant character. He doesn't care about anything else but only murdering goblins, ogres and possibly orcs if we see any in the future. The same can't be said about his team-mates though, very quickly Goblin Slayer amasses a fair amount, likable characters in his party. We don't yet know much about them,  and we like them already, that's a great thing. We will definitely look forward for the rest of the character development.\\n\\n\\n\r\nYes I can mention you will see some of the budget went into animating anime breasts and glued long female hair on a pair on nipples. I say if you're suggesting rape scenes, extreme violence and gore, stop censoring the good stuff. I liked the idea having a good enjoyable story with likable characters, and anime boobies.",

            "content": "Not even Goblin Slayer himself can save this show from its mediocrity.\r\nTo begin with, the story is barebones. The characters are tasked with killing goblins. Obviously. I quit watching this show half way through episode 4. As such, I can't speak for the story later on. Maybe it gets better, but in all likelihood that wouldn't have mattered anyway. This show just reeks of laziness and mediocrity.\r\nThe art is pathetic. This show came out in fall of 2018. Just as a comparison, Bunny Girl Senpai also came out in fall of 2018 and blew Goblin Slayer out of the fucking park. It is inexcusable foran action-adventure fantasy anime to look so obviously worse than a romance anime- especially when the romance anime has the action-adventure fantasy anime beat on every other front as well. It should also be mentioned that the studio behind Goblin Slayer is fully capable of making a kickass anime. It's hard to believe that this garbage was produced by the same company that made Steins;Gate and Re:Zero. Dreadful static shots of characters delivering their script paired with lousy action scenes. Get that garbage out of here.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to sound, this is probably the best part of the anime, so I'll keep it brief. The OP is non-obtrusive. This means that the OP already has 99.99% of all other OPs beat. Also, the DOOM-like soundtrack is also pretty badass. Which reminds me: the \"characters\".\\n\\n\r\nThe only good character is Doom Slayer- I mean Goblin Slayer. He's fuckin cool. The secondary protagonist is also nice, she was shown to have some fortitude to her name. Unfortunately, she also falls into the trope of the \"Hey, person I get along with and who I know has good intentions, be nice!\". Annoying trope, stop writing that trope into characters. The other characters in this anime are lousy, lazy, generic, etc. \\n\\n\r\nThis is an anime that, if I'd never seen the good shit, I might think this is a good anime. Unfortunately, I have seen the good shit. I can no longer be impressed by static, boring shots of characters expositing in an unnatural way. 15fps animation will not cut it in a late-2018 anime. I was of the belief that standards were higher nowadays, but seeing as how this steaming pile of trash has a 7.7, maybe i'm just an exception. \\n\\n\r\n3/10",

All of the girls in Goblin Slayer are really quite vulnerable, Especially with the atrocious acts of the goblins themselves, So seeing that over and over did make me feel quite uncomfortable.\\n\\n\r\nIt made me feel a greater sense of relief when the goblins when the goblins were dealt with. The goblins.. are scary.. save me from the goblins! > <\\n\\n\r\nOverall I did really enjoy watching this anime. I actually watched the first nine episodes in a day, The rest of it a day later!

            "content": "Going into Goblin Slayer I wasn't expecting perfection, but I had high hopes that the masses would finally have picked an anime to worship for the season that wasn't dreadfully boring or a slice of life. Needless to say, I expected too much.\r\nMINOR SPOILERS AHEAD\r\nStory: 3\r\nCompletely uninspired, it's as if Fairy Tail and The Seven Deadly Sins were thrown into a blender, but without any of the charm. The story follows Goblin Slayer, an adventurer that is more likely than not a high functioning autist that, as his name suggests, focuses on slaying goblins. You might expect for there to be some extraordinary reason forit but the most you'll get out of the series is \"they killed my family.\" Come on guys, M. Night Shyamalan could write a better backstory than this.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5\\n\\n\r\nI'm not rating the art poorly because it isn't well made, I'll say that it looks above average, but in the fantasy genre of anime is has no qualities that make it stand out. Medieval getups, mages, goblins, you name a generic fantasy trope and Goblin Slayer has it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\\n\r\nNothing great but the sound and music was decent. My only complaint is the gross goblin noises you hear every 5 seconds.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 3\\n\\n\r\nI haven't seen such poorly written characters in anime before. None of them serve any purpose other than to get a chuckle or two out of the audience. Lizard man likes cheese. Old dwarf is a drunk. Healer girl is innocent. Elf girl is bossy and hot tempered. Goblin Slayer is most likely a sociopath. All of the characters are so forgettable that I've already forgotten their names, and I only just finished the last episode about 10 minutes ago.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\\n\r\nI'll be honest, I'm pretty easily entertained when it comes to anime. I'm not a big complainer overall and am usually satisfied after finishing a show. Often times, though, it felt like story arcs would go on much longer than they should have (I'm looking at you, blind priestess) and it was tedious to go through. Action sequences were decent though. Predictable, but decent.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4.6\\n\\n\r\nGoblin Slayer thought it was something bigger and better than it really was. It made headlines with its debut episode and anime YouTubers saying it was going to be the next Berserk. The show has nothing that makes it stand out and if you haven't seen it yet, don't waste your time. I hate closing on a negative note though, so I'll say that Goblin Slayer could possibly redeem itself in the second season.",

            "content": "Welcome to my first review fellow weebs. So tbh I started watching this anime after seeing many memes of the girl being raped in the first episode. I still think that this image delivers a wrong first impression, because scenes like that, werent repeated that often. If you keep watching, you realize that the first episode was only brutal, for the setting of the anime, because it is not your average anime about an adventurer who is striving to be the best, but only a maniac, who has done nothing in his life besides killing goblins. Of course that has something to do with hispast, but I dont even think it is that important. It is more than entertaining, to see him work out strategies to maximize the deaths of goblins. Seeing him talking about seemingly useless stuff about goblins. The story doesnt go very deep and most of the characters arent very different from your standard side characters. For me that wasn\u00b4t the reason to watch it. I literally only watched it because of goblin slayer. He is the only character which seemed interesting to me after a whole while, with his monotone voice and his reserved behaviour. It is not like he is unpredictable but it was enjoying to watch an anime, with an attitude like his.",

Actually, the title \"Goblin Slayer\" is actually a big spoiler of the series.\r\nAnd that's not necessarily a bad thing.\r\nBeing simple, the show is about a guy who kills Goblins for revenge. He could kill dragons, trolls or anything else, but he choose to go for the weakest types of creatures, even being strong as he truly is. \r\nAnd that's another important thing: He is strong.\r\nNot only physically, but his strategies are much more smarter than from ther others. He is likea brain, thinking of everything to simply kill goblins. And apparently, this is the only thing in his mind, at least on the beggining episodes. \\n\\n\r\nThe series is cruel sometimes. When it shows why Goblins can be bad, the anime can get kinda \"dark\" (not really the expression here, but whatever) and you start to understand the obsession of the main character with hunting them.\\n\\n\r\nSince i took a look at another reviews i won't take it too long, but i will say what impressed me most on the series: the fact that the personality of the main character changes gradually, but not really. He has the same goals since the beginning, but he gradually turns more malleable. \\n\\n\r\nWell, for finishing this, the series would take an honest 7.5 for me. I like the type of series, the RPG feel. I guess it could take more story from the characters, but i guess i'm gonna wait for season 2. On the hype!",

The title Goblin Slayer is enough to describe this show, there's no complex plot and that's not a bad thing. \r\nI think the best thing about this show is it's simplicity, it's direct and straight to the point. it doesn't try to confuse you or make you think too hard, everything is focused on slaying goblins. There are many different ways to do so but that's really all it is. There are other creatures much stronger than goblins trying to destroy humanity but the GoblinSlayer doesn't care, his only mission is to slay goblins.\\n\\n\r\nGoblin Slayer is definitely worth the watch, for a little while I was disappointed that the main character didn't want to face tougher opponents but I ended up appreciating the shows dedication to it's theme. Anyone that likes some action should check this out.",

            "content": "I watched the first five episodes like a while ago and stopped watching it because, even if this show is not entirely terrible, there is way better shows out there that deserves my attention. This is my first review ever but this show really caught my attention so here it goes. (I'm French-Canadian so ignore the grammar mistakes if some are found.)\r\nI want to start by saying that my favorite type of anime are seinen. I have watched many of them that are as violent and disturbing as this show can be so none of the so-called disturbing scenes affected my opinion on this show.\r\nThestory is about a dude named Goblin Slayer, hence the title, that slays goblins. That's it. There is nothing more you need to know. It's like the writers wrote the story in one night after smoking a blunt. Usually, I don't care if the plot of a show is plain simple, but there's some damn limit to it.\\n\\n\r\nLet's start with the good things about Goblin Slayer. Personally, I think the art is decent. It's pretty much on the same level as any other great seinens out there. The fight scenes and the soundtrack are great and it's basically the only good thing this show has. \\n\\n\r\nNow with the rest...\\n\r\nLet's talk about these ''characters''\\n\r\nOh boy...\\n\r\nI don't know how anyone could give two shits about any of these characters! This is easily the worst part of this show. These poorly written characters with unoriginal backgrounds basically ruins the entire show. Seriously, they didn't even give enough of a fuck to name any of the characters! I understand there is suppose to be some D&D inspiration for this, but this just look like lazy writing. The main dude, Goblin Slayer, is honestly the most boring asshole I saw in a while. All you will hear him say is ''Sounds good'', ''okay'', and stuff about goblins. Talking about goblins, you will think, since he's the main character of the show, he would get some proper backstory, but fuck no chief we don't have time for that. The reason he hates goblins is... wait for it *minor spoiler incoming*... goblins slaughtered people he cared about when he was young. Jeez fucking louise, did not expect this!\\n\\n\r\nThe priestess, as you would totally expect from her young innocent girl appearance, has only one purpose : being rescued by Goblin Slayer. Sometimes she can do her spells, sometimes she can't, and there's no actual reason about it except for the sake of the plot. That elf, which is apparently 2000 years old, acts like she's a naive 14 year old girl from the suburbs who never seen anything bad in her entire fucking life. It makes you wonder if she had been locked in her room for her entire 2000 years of existence. That big-titted farmer girl has no purpose but being present from time to time to execute her mission as fapping material, obviously. I could go like this on and on with every one of them.\\n\\n\r\nAnother amazing example of how lazy the writers are: they keep using rape and sexual assault as a way to make the watcher hate the bad guys because they have no original way to do so. I swear, that ogre in episode 4 said at least a hundred time he was going to rape the women during the fight with Goblin Slayer. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Goblin Slayer is a great show if you feel like watching some gore and a couple of great fight scenes, but don't expect a story because there's none. Like zero, nada, rien. This whole anime feels like the studio made an animation over some edgy 14 years old fanfiction written in one night. It doesn't seem to get better after the fifth episode anyway so I don't think I'll be finishing it anytime soon.\\n",

            "content": "I love playing Role Playing Games especially if the RPG set in medieval age with dungeon crawling and flying wild dragons everywhere. Not just that, I am quite familiar with the game of Dungeons and Dragons which is a tabletop version of action-fantasy RPG. For me, Goblin Slayer is a re-imagination of Dungeons and Dragons with a very cruel Dungeon Master who loves to torture the players with little things that often overlooked by everyone. But before we started to get into the review, let's begin with my opinion about controversy that has been lingering around this anime from the very first episode.\r\nThe first episodeof Goblin Slayer shown a major disturbing scene of rape and Crunchyroll carelessly put it on stream without any warning, starting the controversy we know today. Since the setting of fantasy with goblins and creatures is already staple with our regular Isekai anime (even when this anime is nowhere near Isekai), people thought at first that this anime would not be that dark. So, that was where exactly the controversy begin. But, what about my opinion? While many people said it was far too edgy for an anime set in fantasy world, I think the disturbing scene is very important for Goblin Slayer's cruel world building. It is very clear that the writer wanted us to know how fearsome little goblins are, especially in huge groups and in their own nest. But the most important is they want to set a lore that there's no female goblin in this world of Goblin Slayer thus making a purpose for the goblin to attack, raze, and kidnap women and children. So, yeah. While I am still a bit disturbed, I still think the disturbing scene is important point for this series to go on.\\n\\n\r\nNow, with that settled, let's talk about the story and characters. As the title suggest, Goblin Slayer revolved around the not-so-adventure of a man who always takes goblin slaying quests. His backstory is quite simple and yet, it is fitting for a story took place in fantasy world like this. The story of wanderlust caused by loss of the loved ones just like a character creation in an RPG. After all, the characters in this anime felt like a personification of Dungeons and Dragons character sheet. Not just that, Goblin Slayer is a man of few words, making him a more fitting description of RPG main protagonist. I love how he eventually ended up in a party consisted of a fairly new adventurer Priestess, a drunken Dwarf Shaman, a cocky High Elf Archer, and a cheese loving Lizard Priest. The party is drawn to him by his deed of slaying goblins, not by his persuasion as he does not talk much (to the point he received a protest from Priestess). This is extended to other people like the Sword Maiden and other adventurers in the guild.\\n\\n\r\nOh yeah, I really love how they kept the characters unnamed and how they kept it that way throughout the series. It made this feeling of anyone could step into those characters shoes. It could be me, it could be you, and it could be anyone.\\n\\n\r\nMy major problem in this anime probably caused by its CGI. I know very well that Goblin Slayer's character design is very much hard to redraw yet very cool and intimidating. I praise anyone who design the characters for those. But it seems the difficulties in redrawing Orcbolg makes the studio decided to utilize CGI for Goblin Slayer's movement. While good CGI models and animations could lead into beautiful animation and direction, the CGI model of Goblin Slayer felt weird as the movements of the model are far too awkward and unnatural. Not just that, the inconsistent changing between 2D and 3D makes me want to say \"Makeup your mind already!\" I just really hope they are going to makeup their mind in the continuation of this series.\\n\\n\r\nThen, let's continue to the soundtrack. While not too remarkable or outstanding, the rocking metal soundtracks in Goblin Slayer surprisingly fit the theme very well. It made my blood boils as The Beard Cutter trying to slash here and there. Simply, the soundtracks amplified Goblin Slayer's hatred towards the goblins very well, reaching the heart of the audience. The opening sequence itself felt very fitting to the dark theme of Goblin Slayer and it accompanied by many references of Dungeons and Dragons in the animation sequence and in the song lyrics as well. Talk about the opening, I think you should check out the music video. I love the performance of that performer who tries to convey a man who literally lost his humanity. So, check them out!\\n\\n\r\nOverall, a continuation of this series is probably a must do since there are still some things that we want to see like the adventure Orcbolg wanted and promised by him to the High Elf Archer. If the animators decided to fix the CGI problem whether making the CGI movements better or maybe getting rid of it, the second season probably could outmatched the first one. And so, I will look forward for the continuation!",

He often uses the same line over and over to reply to others, but this a key part of his character. His only desire is to kill goblins. He could get some poon tang from all the hoesaround him whenever he wanted, but his only goal in life is too kill. \\n\\n\r\nHighly recommend for first time anime watchers and all anime fans",

            "content": "Summary: Goblin Slayer will not go down as the most memorable anime of the year, or even the season. It is, by almost all means, average at best. This being said, watch it if you want a \"turn your brain off and enjoy\" type of show! I enjoyed this show thoroughly, and despite its mediocrity, found it one of the easier shows to binge that I've watched in quite some time. \r\nWARNING: This one is gorier and more graphic than your typical anime, especially in the first episode. \r\nStory: 6/10\r\nThis story is nothing more than typical. The setting is ripped straight from Dungeons and Dragons,as are the characters. Therefore, nothing particularly crazy ever happens, and the plot is very easy to predict. In fact, the title gives the plot away! This anime was not really trying to say much, which is strangely refreshing. Not having to deal with any speculation about the hidden meanings of the show can be nice from time to time, after all.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\r\n\"Average\" is a proper term to describe the show's visuals. Half of the time, Goblin Slayer is animated with noticeable CG, and the supporting cast looks very faithful to the story's source material. Meaning, nothing new or groundbreaking came in the visual department, besides Goblin Slayer's signature glowing red eye in battle scenes. However, the show does a commendable job at animating crowds, and doesn't often resort to CG animation in giant hordes of Goblins or armies of adventurers.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nMusic and voice acting are both pseudo-strong points of Goblin Slayer, with memorable opening/ending songs adding an especially fun aspect to episodes. In addition, the banter between characters was never dull, and always kept me engaged when the gore was toned down. They didn't do anything amazing, however, this story and the characters didn't really need them to. Finally, OST tracks were used appropriately for raising and lowering the tension of scenes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\r\nLet me start off by reiterating: the setting is literally Dungeons and Dragons, so the characters did not deviate from that at all. They do not even have individual names. Development was very subtle, and essentially non-existent outside of Goblin Slayer and Priest. The supporting characters themselves were very cut-and-paste in essentially every fashion. The female characters, especially, seemed to be part of a developing \"harem\" for Goblin Slayer (though he would not be interested in that notion in the slightest.) Though, Goblin Slayer did get a fair amount of characterization, when all was said and done. By the end, his tunnel vision for Goblin-slaying seems to have diminished, and had become much more trusting/willing to rely on others. He still retained his stoic, dull demeanor that he was known for, and his vocabulary still seemed as limited as ever, but it is clear that he is not stagnant.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nOh, man. This show was enjoyable as ever for me. This may be due to one simple fact: the show knows exactly what it is. It almost seems to accept its own mediocrity, and runs with it anyway. It was not trying to have the plot of Overlord, the Comedy of Konosuba, or the Action of Berserk (okay, maybe that one's debatable...), but instead it feels comfortable in its own stereotypical, worn-out narrative. I, personally, found it very charming in this instance, because so many recent shows tend to attempt to force some kind of differentiating factor into itself, with variable results. The action, while not particularly great, was fun, the banter made the bland characters entertaining, and the rudimentary plot progressed naturally. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nDespite so many factors being average, the charm of this show made it enjoyable enough to be rated an 8/10, in my eyes. Once in a while, it's nice to be able to throw things like character motivations, plot analysis, and high expectations out the window and just enjoy what's in front of you. That's what this show was for me: a cathartic break from the somewhat-tedious work of analyzing character-heavy or plot-heavy shows. Should your expectations be high watching this show? Absolutely not. Does this show do anything noteworthy? Hardly. But, is it enjoyable? Absolutely. Throwing out any sort of critical eyes, and instead replacing them with those of a none-the-wiser fan can often do good for the mind, and this show is a perfect opportunity to do that. Watch if you don't mind the gore and graphic content!",

            "content": "Goblin Slayer review:\r\n=Contains minor spoilers=\r\nPlease note that I have not yet read the manga/LN, so this is based purely on the anime.\r\nSo lets start with the positives!\r\nI really like the aspect of the goblins raping women as weird as it sounds. Hear me out, there's a plothole in most fantasy shows/games to do with goblins. We usually only see male goblins - so how do they reproduce? It's perfectly explained in Goblin Slayer - goblins rape women to reproduce. This also makes them seem more vile and gives another reason to kill them. \r\nI didn't think the show 'crossed the line' as some people havesaid online. Yes, it does have gore, rape and a dark story overall. But none of this is new. Devilman (the original and Crybaby) had gore, sex and a dark story to tell. But enough of that.\\n\\n\r\nI absolutely love the soundtrack! OST is something that I find incredibly important as it really helps set the mood for the show. I can't stop listening to the opening as well.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is really based off DnD. Its basically a Dungeons and Dragons campaign, which I LOVE. \\n\\n\r\nAt first, I REALLY didn't like Goblin Slayer (the character lol.). He just seemed to be a stereotypical emotionless character and I found it confusing as to why he only kills goblins. Now I'm not going to spoil anything, but it is explained, and I actually ended up liking GS as the show went on.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters are pretty cool as well, but I don't really have a lot to say about them. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation didn't really stick out to me and just wasn't that great in my opinion. Plus, GS was 3D animated I believe, which I didn't rally like. The setting was quite pretty, though and the character designs definitely stick out to me. I quite liked the art style as well. So overall, the art was pretty good, the animation isn't great.\\n\\n\r\nSo what about the negatives?\\n\r\nIt kinda bugged me that none of the characters have actual names. Makes them less memorable in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nLike I said, the animation wasn't that great and some of it was 3D animated, which I just didn't like.\\n\\n\r\nI found the recap episode really boring, so I kinda just skipped that.\\n\\n\r\nThose are the only real negatives that I can think of. \\n\\n\r\nYou can call this show edgy (it really is) and that it crossed the line (it didn't) but I will defend this show.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're into DnD, dark fantasies and don't mind gore or rape, this is the show for you. However, if you dont like any of these things, it's probably not your thing. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I personally LOVED the show and I'm hyped for season 2!!!!!",

It still works out better than most of my D&D sessions though.\r\nStory 6/10\r\nThe story is okay, but kind of bland. Most of the arcs boil down to the same story beats with the same conclusion. Although the goblin slayer could easily get stale the show prevents this by throwing in some tactics and fight scenes. Especially the final fights of the arcs are fun. The series isn\u2019t just about slaying goblins all the time and contains some good downtime in between the confrontations which adds some flavourto the series. The show is kind of light on comedy, but the times it does come up it doesn\u2019t overstay its welcome and in general the show sticks to the darker tone it establishes in the very first episode. The story does have problems with plot armour though, after a while it becomes clear that nothing lasting will ever happen to the main characters. The ending of the season was chosen well and the season ended on a high note.\\n\\n\r\nArt 6/10\\n\r\nGoblin Slayer looks fine, but nothing really stands out. Character designs are alright and some characters are memorable. The goblins could have used some diversity among themselves as they all look pretty much the same (champions and lord excluded). The animation is okay, but nothing to write home about and some bad CGI pops up from time to time. In some scenes the animation can feel a bit static. Although the fights are fun from a story perspective they clearly lack in choreography, considering the nature of the series this is quite bad.\\n\\n\r\nSound 5/10\\n\r\nThe sound design is completely average with some cases where the sound effects stick out a bit as well as music that sometimes overpowers the scenes in which it plays.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 4/10\\n\r\nThe characters in this show are about as one dimensional as can be, character development is about non-existent with only some development from Goblin Slayer himself. Most of the main cast gets about as much development as the side characters that only show up in a few scenes. These side characters have an absolute bare minimum of personality and are all pretty much interchangeable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10\\n\r\nWith all that being said, the show is still very much enjoyable despite all the flaws. The simplicity of the characters and the plot make it very easy to follow along after a long day without worrying too much about thinking.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 6/10\\n",

            "content": "Doom Guy would be proud.\r\nThe dark knight of the fantasy world, Goblin Slayer. Or, more accurately, \"GO-bo-LEAN SLEIGH-er-san\". His sword strikes down the evil midget spawns of satan, in order to protect the poor innocent villagers from their terror. Neither fame nor fortune, does he receive. Yet, he pushes on.\r\nIf you're easily disturbed by graphic content, then look someplace else. However, if your Testosterone levels are over 9000, and you need some dark fantasy to fill in the void Berserk left in you, then don't waste another second of your time, and start watching this anime.\r\n*Non-Spoiler Review*\r\nThe story is about Goblin Slayer going out to*spoiler alert* slay some goblins. I'm sorry for dropping that bomb right after saying that this was a non-spoiler review, but it had to be done. While there doesn't seem to be anything exciting about watching a guy grind exp by slaying some low level mobs, the author manages to create situations which are engaging and at times thrilling to experience. In short, he was able to make monsters, monstrous again.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was fairly standard. It does have a nice touch to it at times, but it also suffers from the use of CG during many moments in the anime. However, there are a few times where the CG actually enhances the watching experience. After completing this anime, I don't have much of a problem with it, so I don't think you would either.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the rare English OP's used in anime. It might not seem like much at first, but once you listen to it a few times, you'll find it to be quite catchy. Plus, the metal OST used for Goblin Slayer is badass. Nothing really memorable in the OST, but it certainly gives you the hype you would expect from a show like this.\\n\\n\r\n\"Soka\". Pretty much the only thing Goblin Slayer says, and that's all he needs to say. The man himself isn't a very interesting character, but why he is the way that he is, is explained in the story. The supporting cast are all very unique, and they feel tangible within the fantasy world that they reside in. Everyone has their own importance to the story, and in developing Goblin Slayer's character.\\n\\n\r\nWatching this man cut down the little fiends is one of the most entertaining things I've watched this season. He's not some hero with op stats, and his fighting style matches with that limitation, resulting in some very creative ways of killing goblins. It's just entertaining, for all the right reasons.\\n\\n\r\nIt's certainly not for everyone, but it's definitely a must-watch for any dark fantasy fans out there.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading this review!",

The main character seemed like he'd be bland, but turned out to be mildly charming in his single-mindedness, which also brought some humor to the otherwise fairly serious anime.\r\nSome people out there seem to think it was edgy, but I don't really see it. As far as the big controversy in the first episode, I've seen worse scenes in critically acclaimed independent films. The scene itself was only a few seconds long and didn't really show anything, so don't let the whiners fool you.\r\nOverall, the quality of the anime was fairly even acrossthe board. Story, art, sound, etc, were fairly solid. Don't expect a deep, engaging story, but there was enough to be entertaining.The sound and art were on par with the rest as well. \\n\\n\r\nLooks like they tease a new season at the end. I for one look forward to seeing what Goblin Slayer does next.",

            "content": "Unfortunately, we have reached a status concerning Goblin Slayer where any discussion of its merits and shortcomings are trimmed out under the guise of the rambunctious controversy that befell its debut. Let me clear the air for that: anything is fair game for criticism regardless of whether or not it is controversial for any degree of reason. So I cannot sit here and understand why someone who would want to argue on a narrative\u2019s decisions would resort to facetiously equating criticism with mere self-absorbed needs for attention and a sheep mentality. The only other more major example I can think of is Fallout 76. Peoplealready having difficulties debating the pros and cons when any word is contorted depending on whether or not the controversial nature of it makes one\u2019s opinion differ from the other. Nothing is sacred; discuss in good faith.\\n\\n\r\nEverything about Goblin Slayer is artificial and shallow. The aesthetics of the animation and artwork are rendered in service to the grimdark nature of its thematic structure and plot, which in turn are in service to enhance the weekly experience of watching OCD-levels of focus on one man hellbent on killing as many goblins in the world that is humanly possible and then some. The worst part of is that anyone believes he is anything more than empty caricature of a character. He is a gimmick, meant to produce memes and create a repetitive cycle of marketing by the sheer fact that people joke about how obsessed he is with killing goblins and then when his motivations are revealed, they fall flat on their face because it is evident how much lack of depth the program actually has. Goblins did bad things, as they always do. There\u2019s nothing more to it than that, it is forgotten about and not explored with any more meaningful depth.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is the show trying to do here? Is it a character study in Goblin Slayer? Is it a narrative about a fantasy world inhabited by terrible, abominable creatures? This show has absolutely no sense of direction. Tell me where the direction is. No one in the cast of characters offers any meaningful contribution besides play a role in Goblin Slayer\u2019s MMO comradery. I figure that is enough for most anime fans, considering the plethora of otaku programs that are available. \\n\\n\r\nFirst, let us analyze the perspective that it is a character study of Goblin Slayer. We begin the debut episode with a novice group of nobodies. Anyone can understand the purpose they serve by the episode\u2019s end \u2013 there\u2019s no shame in calling them plot devices because while those concerns are valid (and will be later expanded on briefly), sometimes they are necessary and the ends justify the means in this case. The introduction to the series is world-building while the star is at the same time one lone individual. Nothing we are specially a stranger to. Thusly, it makes literary sense to expand on the story of Goblin Slayer in the successive episode to capitalize on the horrors a viewer might be feeling when their suspicions of this fantasy world\u2019s nature (i.e the manner in which the citizens of the fantasy world engage with it and how they expect in turn for the world to engage with them. Normal, ordinary people understand that goblins are frightening creatures that do grotesque things and are also aware that there is not much they are capable of. In addition, the state does not care very much about protecting the citizenry from goblins because of how it affects finances), however what occurs instead is that the writer falls onto the trap by treating us to the most bleak version imaginable of this story and in turn the least imaginative and most predictable. Now, some might ask if that even matters \u2013 if the purpose of this story is to explore one man\u2019s struggle against this horrific set of circumstances, then there is nothing wrong with this episode. However, what is the purpose of every other aspect of this show that fails to explore this premise? Why should we care about the political affairs of nations or the heroic exploits of characters like the blind priestess woman? If they are not in service to this character study or are not well connected to it, then they are nothing but distractions. Because that is something the grimdark aspect of this show that cares more about being gritty and dark than being contemplative would care more to do. We have hints of a dangerously personal story or one that explores its world through it. Instead, we get neither and one that has more variables at play than it knows what to do with.\\n\\n\r\nSecond, is it a narrative about a fantasy world inhabited by terrible abominable creatures? You are telling me that your ideas of executing this premise is by having goblins over and over again commit heinous acts. From the New World is a beloved example of how to have high stakes conflict between two races contain much more complexity. Some might say that is a false equivalency, but we are only comparing one variable here: the role of the \u201cmonster\u201d creatures, rats versus goblins. They are both presented as being terrifying. Goblins rape, goblins pillage. Well, rats seem to be capable of reproduction and they certainly also have an aptitude for violence. But there is also more to the rats than that. There is greater complexity between perpetrator (rat) and victim (human) in scenarios where they commit acts comparable to those of goblins in goblin slayer. Why exactly is the degree to which goblins are terrible the same degree to which they serve a purpose in the story? An increase in evil acts by a species does not equate with an increase of quality in their role within the narrative. They are simple tools that the story mashes over a viewer\u2019s head repeatedly without significant progress in their usage amongst the progressing plot. In a manner, it is a narrative about a fantasy world with despicable creatures. It also happens to not have anything more interesting to say other than that.\\n\\n\r\nIn that case, we are left with barebones attempt at characterization. After all, it is not so far off in truth that great heroes need to have great villains for their plots. Would Batman be as compelling without his Joker? We see with The Dark Knight Rises how pitiful a narrative can become if even one variable in the equation is not competent enough. Goblins are not compelling creatures narrative-wise or character-wise. There is very little to them besides being the embodiment of evil in this world. The addition that they are mostly male is more flabbergasting than it is intriguing. If Goblin Slayer\u2019s sole motivation is to kill goblins, then you can point the dots about how interesting a character he is capable of becoming.\\n\\n\r\nAnd do not even utter a word about the little priest girl. All I see is marketing at play.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of art, audio, and animation - we have standard animation. Alright, that is fair. If they are going for a grimdark atmosphere, it would be incorrect to say that the visual aspect does not pay successful service of that because it does. It does the job that is required but it does not go beyond that. It is not criminal. The same would apply to the art; it is not very memorable and uses darker colors for a significant portion of its runtime, which is again not criminal, but it is strikingly another example of where the show is focusing its action. It is \u201cdark\u201d; it is \u201cgritty\u201d. Down to its composition, it demands that the viewer be enthralled in its shadows and to not feel comfortable. But I once more question if the way it is executed has any real value.\\n\\n\r\nOn an audio level, there are plenty of examples where hysterical screaming is concerned. They have that sense of panic nailed enough. The opening song is an interesting choice of music, but it is one that is surprisingly welcome. It brings a much needed complexity to the atmosphere. It might be an overtly gritty show, but it has well-crafted flair to open and close its runtime each session. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, we have a shell. Goblin Slayer is an edifice of artificiality. There is nothing controversial within that statement, but there is not much to walk away with. It is the definition of edgy, an attempt at grimdark with no attributes that make it earned nor is it intentionally innate with a constructed purpose. If we are in it at all, we are in it for a good time but not something worth your time. \\n\\n\r\n[This review was copied from a blog titled \"Fictional Freak\", a new website where a band of college writers develop their writing by commenting on all the anime, gaming, and later literature that fascinates them or is being circulated.

            "content": "This review is heavily based on personal opinion and may feel biased (which I don't disagree if you say so), feel free to agree or disagree.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nThe story of Goblin Slayer is just great. It adds a dark, unforgivable twist to the oversaturation of fantasy genre. Unlike your typical fantasy series (or even almost any series) where if you beat a monster or someone, then you'd have no problem facing them off after that, in Goblin Slayer while it indeed does feel like the protagonist is getting more and more skilled after slaying more and more goblins, it never feels certain that he will emergevictorious, which is just rare for me.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 3/10\\n\r\nThe art of Goblin Slayer is just.... terrible to the point I'm having trouble enjoying it. Don't even get me started with the bad CG and the really jarring, constant switch of bad CG and hand-drawn (not actually) animation, the hand-drawn animation itself is terrible and feels really low budget. Many of the action shots after the first episode are actually still frames, and that's where you're supposed to put the money shot into.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4/10\\n\r\nI'd say the sound design is decent, but the reason why I'm giving such low rating is the fight scene's background music. The metal music BGM is really out of touch with the fantasy settings and it makes the goblins feels really weak, which makes the show more feeling like a power fantasy than a dark fantasy. \\n\\n\r\nMoreover it makes me think that White Fox sees the \"Goblin Slayer is just Doom Slayer in fantasy setting.\" comments from the trailer to the point where they just immediately hires a bunch of metal artists to make it feel like DOOM. It's just not right for me, Goblin Slayer is indeed as badass as the Doom Slayer but he is NOT the Doom Slayer. Whereas Doom Slayer is certain to win and kills his enemies, Goblin Slayer is not, he doesn't receive any special powers so he only relies on his instinct, experience, and guts.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5/10\\n\r\nThe characters from Goblin Slayer has personalities yes, but the little details here and there that they left out from the source materials really makes them less relatable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2/10\\n\r\nThe bad CG, bad animation, the Metal BGM that really makes me hate the show to the point where I don't even want to finish it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10\\n\r\nGoblin Slayer is a medieval dark fantasy anime that tries to put a spin to the oversaturated fantasy setting but fails to do so due to poor execution.",

            "content": "Goblin Slayer has garnered a lot of attention recently for its content. The art style clashed with people's perceptions of what content would lie therein, and shock became offense for many. \r\nFor me, Goblin Slayer was anything but shocking. I'd even say its par for the course, an average show. Does it have brutal scenes? Yes. Does it execute such scenes to tell a compelling story? No. \r\nThe problem with Goblin Slayer lies with its frail storytelling. Storytelling which encroaches too far into Tolkien's legendarium, whilst also being told in a childishly simplistic manner. People were offended by the rape scenes, I was offended bythe terse dialogue and exposition.\\n\\n\r\nWhile certain premises of this show are appealing, the lackluster dialogue and abruptness of certain scenes dulls them immensely. The borrowed storytelling feels disingenuous and really takes away from some of the more creative moments. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is largely good but the CGI still doesn't quite mesh well enough with the scenes, despite it being above average. It is a good adaptation which is faithful to the source material, but that is the problem.\\n\\n\r\nGoblin Slayer is an average show. It meets my minimum standards to be worth watching, if only to serve as a cautionary tale.\\n",

            "content": "Four Episodes in and the series finally starts to feel it is finally finding its footing and pacing. Which is quite understandable with what needed to be phased out of the first two episodes of the series. Some of you may have guessed by now that one of the big things about the manga was it's vivid depicting of the shock factor. Which did not shy away from striking depictions of rape amongst other things? As disturbing as those moments were though, they did help set the pace, tone and narrative that is the Goblin Slayer series. They help elevator the dangers and horrors ofGoblins, establishing not only the fear of a brutal death but the terror of not dying. And set the tone of what makes Goblin Slayer the person, different from adventurers.\\n\\n\r\nBy glossing over the first band of adventures (which ruins the fake out that these characters were more involved with the series) and entirely removing the 2nd group of adventures from ep. 2 as well as glossing over how dire and needed goblin slaying is; Goblin Slayer's overall presence comes off a bit diminished than in the manga. We don't get to see the clear difference in his experience not just compared to novices but even a band of experienced adventurers unfamiliar with Goblin tactics. These simple and understandable changes lead to some awkward pacing. Luckily the brutally of Goblin Slayer is enough to hold a fans attention and the series does its best to reintroduce some of the dialogue and ideas back in other ways but a bit of balance is lost when the skip over some of the dialogue and narrative as it originally was.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 3 is a bit awkward too since it also cuts some world and character building as well as crams in more of the manga into an episode then it probably should have, but the pay off comes in Episode 4. Episode 4 comes out untouched by censoring and the dialogue and narrative are allowed to flow at it's intended pace. We finally get into the more methodical nitty, gritty approach of the series then hinted at or glossed over aspects of it from earlier episodes. We get a much better idea and feel of Goblin Slayer's experience and drive. The things that make him different from an Adventurer.\\n\\n\r\nLuckily at this point, the series will go into more and more in what makes Goblin Slayer who he is rather than showing off more shocking moments that need to be censored out and NOW is when I start to get excited about the series. Now that pretty much the porn is out of the way, we can get into the grit of the series. And honestly, now that the series seems to have found itself, it makes the first 3 episodes a bit more understandable and bearable.",

            "content": "Ah, Goblin Slayer. You.. You\u2026 You are Goblin Slayer.\r\nNone have gathered as much controversy as Goblin Slayer. As being one really popular manga there already was a big amount of hype for this anime. Then the first episode launched and shit hit the fan. Shock, disgust, praise, hate, laughter, tears, everything you can imagine with a so-called ''controversial anime'' happened. Videos were shot, people have talked and statements were made. From the PG rating to *the* scene to the memes, it was a shitshow that was unavoidable for days.\r\nThe landscape of the Goblin Slayer fanbase nowadays mostly consists of haters, Berserk elitists, praisers and casualwatchers and you can easily depict every type of fan by just scrolling through all the reviews.\\n\\n\r\nSo, after all what has happened over the past few weeks, how is the show? \\n\\n\r\nYeah you already saw the rating I gave so you know I thought it was okay. Not as good or bad as people make it out to be, but still enjoyable. What is it that it makes it okay? Grab your swords and slay some goblin, this is my review of Goblin Slayer.  \\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\r\nAn amateur priestess begins its adventure by joining a party who are also first timers. They begin their first quest which is slaying some Goblins. (Side note: Get used to hearing the word Goblins.) The party sadly underestimate the difficulty of the quest and fail hard in way that\u2026 that\u2026 lets just say that the party doesn't stand for very long. After the failure the priestess gets attacked by Goblins, only to be saved by a knight called ''Goblin Slayer''. The priestess and Goblin Slayer form a strange team that not only surprises adventurers, but surprises others, like a group of adventurers who give a difficult quest to Goblin Slayer. He accepts and they set out to save the world (or something). \\n\\n\r\nIt's an alright story. It doesn't break new ground (even if people claim it does), but it isn't disinteresting. It's fine as it is.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\r\nI am sorry but the animation is just not that good. The darker colors makes me think it looks good, but when you actually take a look at the backgrounds you just find bland fantasy backgrounds with nothing going for it. The CG cuts are also off-putting. It is not bad CG (far from it), but it just changes constantly and that just takes me out of the experience. I still like the action scenes enough to give it a 6.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nDoom soundtrack. If you like the Doom soundtrack you will like this OST. In my opinion, it works like it should even if it is not my taste. Also, I like the Opening.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\r\nAll the characters are either stereotypes or don't contribute anything, except for Goblin Slayer. This guy is amazing. He only, and I mean, ONLY cares about killing Goblins. All his dialogue consist of talking shit about Goblins and it is great. No wonder he gets the spotlight, he is amazing! He carries the anime though, so for me the character part of the anime is just a 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nI have thought long and hard about this. It feels generic, but it is intriguing. I sometimes hope for more action while at other times more character development. I was shocked by this anime but at the same time charmed. The fanservice was hurting the anime the anime but also elevating it. So after reconsidering all my feelings, praises and criticisms, I put my enjoyment right at the middle. 7/10 = it's okay.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nThe last thing I want to talk about is this:\\n\r\nDo you like this anime? Great!\\n\r\nDon't you like this anime? Great!\\n\r\nAre shocked by this anime? Great! (wait not that way)\\n\r\nAren't shocked by this anime? Great!\\n\r\nDo you think it is too popular? Great!\\n\r\nDo you think people are complaining too much? Great!\\n\r\nDo you think people are praising too much? Great!\\n\r\nDo you have an opinion on this anime? Great!\\n\\n\r\nJust remember this:\\n\r\nDon't be a dick. It is that simple.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, I personally recommend this anime, even if this season has better than this.\\n",

            "content": "Goblin Slayer was a'ight.\r\nI know that's a pretty underwhelming response to such a polarizing series but it encapsulates my feelings towards this show perfectly.\r\nIt's merely alright. It's far from great, it's far from awful. It's not a blight upon human society nor do I feel that it's a bastion of grim dark fantasy. Honestly I have more to say about people's reaction to Goblin Slayer than the show itself; but I'll try my best to avoid getting into that and just talk about *the show*.\r\nGoblin Slayer is a dark-fantasy action series about... well... slaying goblins. The actual slaying-of-goblins aspect to the show was admittedly enjoyable.I liked how practical the titular Goblin Slayer was with his goblin-exterminating strategies, and found it to be the show's strong points.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of everything else it's basically your run-of-the-mill fantasy anime, albeit with a protagonist that sticks out from his world like a sore thumb. There's also some occasional moments of grim reality, though they're juxtaposed against busty, moe, anime girls that look like they crawled out of this summer's hottest new Isekai that will be forgotten in a year.\\n\\n\r\nThe side cast in Goblin Slayer was also pretty uninteresting and they hit all of your standard D'n'D party tropes. You have the snobby elven archer that's a tsundere, the drunkard dwarf with a loud mouth, the lizard guy that is your stoic hunter-tracker type, and finally the human priestess/healer who is your kawaii \"best-girl\". They're all relatively inoffensive characters that do little to annoy me nor do they do much to make me give a crap about them. It can be fairly amusing seeing them attempt to converse with our dead-pan Goblin Slayer, but that's about all I got out of them.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of plot, the gang go on a couple goblin-hunting missions and then the show ends. So far no branching story arc has been revealed and it feels almost slice-of-life at times. If you're looking for a satisfying narrative there isn't really one.\\n\\n\r\nWith that all out of the way, let's talk about the elephant in the room; the first episode. After finishing the series I can safely say that you can remove the first episode and lose almost nothing besides it setting up how evil the Goblins are. Honestly, showing them murder and pillage the titular character's home village would've been enough to do that, but I digress. I also find it very bizarre how little impact the infamous events of that episode has on the show's secondary character, the Priestess. I'd imagine anyone would be emotionally scarred and incredibly vindictive towards goblins after such an encounter but she seems relatively the same before and after. There's a few brief flash backs to the incident, but she never seems more than mildly perturbed about them.\\n\\n\r\nWhich leads me to my main issue with Goblin Slayer; it didn't seem to know what it wanted to be. You could view it as juxtaposition but I see it as tonal confusion. On one hand Goblin Slayer is comedic and pokes fun at fantasy tropes like it's Konosuba, on the other hand it wants to be grim-dark like it's Berserk. In my opinion it manages to hit neither aspect well by trying to be both. The dark moments come off as hilariously out of place and trying too hard, while the comedic moments feel tonally tasteless against the grim events.\\n\\n\r\nAll-in-all I think Goblin Slayer is not as bad of a show as it was made out to be by critics, however I don't think it's that good either. The finale gave me some hope that the next season may pick up the pace and find its footing, but for now I wouldn't personally recommend the series.",

            "content": "Released in the fall season of 2018, Goblin slayer, is the animated adaptation of the series of the homonymous light novels written by Kumo Kagyuu and illustrated by Noboru Kannatsuki, which have been published since 2016, and which additional to the anime it also has an adaptation to the manga format also published since 2016. The anime then, released on October 7, 2018, is a production of the White Fox studios, directed by Takaharu Ozaki, which came to have a total of 12 episodes.\r\nGoblin Slayer was an anime that made quite a noise during the premiere of its first episode, not precisely for the bestreasons, to be involved in a controversy, caused by a couple of scenes that occurred during the episode in question, among which you can find a certain scene of rape, which led to more than one being scandalized and scream to heaven, soon cataloging the title as an abomination, and attributing it a lot of nonsense.\\n\\n\r\nQuite a foolish behavior to tell the truth, since not only the scenes in question is not that they were precisely strong (at least in comparison to what this world has been able to offer in the past), but also because many of the criticisms that were made against the anime for this whole situation, did not even take into consideration the context within which these scenes were happening, or the purpose of the series for them, which obviously was to establish the goblins as these horrible creatures and dangerous, as well as make clear the tone for the title, not taking notice also the classification and theme of the work in question.\\n\\n\r\nNow, with all this I mean that Goblin Slayer is some masterpiece of the anime, misunderstood by viewers because of its adult content ?, Not close, but it is definitely not a title nor as sordid or shocking as the chapter in question and so many of what they shouted against or even in favor of it have wanted us to see, being in fact Goblin Slayer a fairly quiet series at times, leaving their \"strong\" scenes restricted to very specific moments of the title.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, leaving aside all this controversial issue, talk about the series as such, Goblin Slayer is an anime fantasy and adventure, specifically classified as a work of dark fantasy, which takes as a basis a typical world of magic and sword without anything particularly remarkable, inspired as the series itself lets us see more than once, in the classic board game of dungeons and dragons, which tells the adventures of an adventurer known as the Goblin Slayer, which, as the name suggests, is specifically dedicated to ending up with whatever Goblin crosses in the middle, this as a consequence of a traumatic event of his past.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough in the beginning our protagonist is presented to us as a lonely and somewhat surly adventurer, who does not stand out for his strength or abilities but for his wit, and who only seems to be able to think of goblins, it will not be long before he is around a small and picturesque party to accompany him in his walks, and for those who will eventually begin to feel some appreciation. That said do not expect to find in this series a great adventure story or anything like that, this is not the epic tale of the hero who has to kill the demon king of the day, these are only the stories of an adventurer, although somewhat particular and strange, and how he earns his living doing what he enjoys the most, killing goblins, so at the plot level you do not expect to find anything especially elaborated, being in this sense a very simple title.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime then develops under a format typical of these adaptations of light novel, being the same composed of small miniarcs plot between 3 and 4 chapters each, each focused on a mission in which our heroes are involved, which have their appeal both to see how our protagonist manages to eliminate his prey in different ways, bringing with it some moments of good climax, as in what is the interaction between this and his party, resulting in general with this Goblin Slayer a fun and entertaining but at the same time not particularly remarkable or engaging, and I must say that at first the anime is not that it would have called my attention a lot, let's say, finding its first couple of chapters not boring but not with much hook, this largely because both the Goblin Slayer and his first travel companion, the priestess, is not that they are characters especially charismatic, it was not until chapter three with the entry on the scene of the rest of the party, consisting of the elf, the dwarf and the lizardman, that the thing became more entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nNotice that with this I do not mean that the Goblin Slayer and the priestess look like bad characters, correctly fulfilling their role in the series, it's just that they are not enough alone to hold a title that is not particularly striking at first. or catching, being in my opinion what sustains the work most of the time precisely what is the on-screen chemistry of its protagonist quintet.\\n\\n\r\nVisually speaking we are facing a competent but not particularly striking work, and that although the title outlines some attractive character designs, and a well done general animation, of course, except for the use of a CGI not entirely convincing to animate many of the movements of our main character, what was the selection of the color palette did not seem the most successful, occupying the anime a selection of dark and brown tones, which although I understand were chosen to accentuate the dark and dirty environment that adopts the title in some moments, this one is not that it attracts too much nor does it make the series stand out any sense, feeling it on my part something monotonous to see, so that this is not an anime that enters precisely through the eyes.\\n\\n\r\nFinally on the music, there is not much to say, just to mention that the soundtrack really goes unnoticed, plus the title opening \"Rightfully\" is not bad, finding it personally very attractive, likewise the ending theme, \"Gin no Kisei \" it also has his thing.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, while for the noise that was in the beginning I expected something more, at the end of the day Goblin Slayer is a magic and sword series of traditional ambience quite competent, it is nothing special and for those looking for a story or characters something more elaborated will surely be short, but it is an entertaining job as long as you do not expect much of it.",

The story for what it is would be enjoyable for me if it had the cast to support it in an interesting way, the idea of someone who is an expert at killing goblns when everyonne else is specialised and aims to kill the Deamon Lord is an intersting idea. Exept that GS and his party have no personality or depth to make them intersting to watch. GS does get a small amount of character growth, but it forms more out of apathy then activly changing; forinstance its said that he always works alone any he never forms a party, but he later does so with little protest when the party trys to spend time with him, and him now being part of a party is now 'character development'.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters have nothing interesting to say most the time, everyone being summarized by one thing the like which encompasses almost all their dialog...\\n\\n\r\nHonestly I could go on and on, but the shows just isnt anything overly knew or well executed. It has some decent action scenes and is set in an interesting world, but the storytelling and character depth fall to short to be overly enjoyable for me.",

We both agreed that this show was pretty fun. Goblin Slayer shows how innovative and creative one man can be at killing something, in this case, it's goblins, obviously. After the rapey first episode, the show tames down in it's sexual nature and is just graphic violence for the most part. It was interesting in the beginning but then the show was just the same every week. There were occasional episodes where they weren'tjust killing goblins and those episode were a nice change of pace. I would've like to learn more about the characters because they seemed pretty diverse. They all got along nicely and I wanted to see more of their past. They only touch on the Goblin Slayer's past a little and it was pretty interesting so it wouldn't hurt the show to add more character development. If White Fox is good at one thing, it's close ups. I swear in every White Fox show I watch, the close ups are really detailed faces, or in this case masks, that really show what the character is going through. Those are phenomenal but besides that, I thought the animation looked pretty average. The manga has better drawings than the show. They also used CGI for when the Goblin Slayer was shown full body. It didn't fit the rest of the show when everyone else is drawn while Goblin Slayer is in full 3D. At the end of the last episode, they did mention that Goblin Slayer will return so in the next season, if that happens, I hope there is more character development and even more strategic battles with goblins. Overall, it was pretty enjoyable and I'll probably watch the second season but if you like Goblin Slayer, you should probably just read the light novel or manga because they're better than the show.",

            "content": "Honestly, Goblin Slayer was not an anime that I planned on watching. For a while, I just thought it would be a boring fantasy anime. \r\nBut, clearly, I was wrong. Goblin Slayer is a slightly darker fantasy anime with action and you should at least feel entertained while watching. As the name suggests, the anime is about slaying goblins. Along with that though is watching the main character's progress. And that goes for a lot of things such as his social circle, his personality, and the way he expresses his emotions. Overall, the story is a bit repetitive. I admit that. It's basically just themfighting goblins over and over again. Each fight is a little different though because of the use of strategies and the turn of events. (Also, just so you know, you don't have to worry about anything too graphic. That certain scene everyone was talking about isn't all that bad. Trust me. It's for the sake of setting the show's atmosphere.)\\n\\n\r\nThe art's not all that unique looking. It's pretty much like your average anime with a few exceptions. I like the character designs and backgrounds though. The CGI wasn't too bad. It was noticeable but not an eyesore. The overall animation was pretty good too.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending songs are great. I feel like there was some wasted potential with the opening animation but it's ok the way it is. And the OSTs are never oddly timed. They always make the fight scenes better when they're used. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters didn't really gain any noticeable development. They were basically the same from start to finish. The only thing that could be easily pointed out is the main character's development and his relationships with others. This isn't necessarily a bad thing though if you don't care about development.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I think it deserves a 9. If you're into short, medieval-ish action anime with something a little different then you may enjoy Goblin Slayer.",

            "content": "4th Review. Goblin Slayer review which will contain spoilers, will be noted beforehand.\r\nEpisodes Seen: 12/12\r\nWelcome to the review of one of the most disappointing animes this season; Goblin Slayer it is. \r\nI\u2019m not a manga nor novel reader so I don\u2019t have any source to make a direct comparison, though the anime still is bad whether or not you\u2019ve seen its source material.\r\nStory: 5/10 (Minor spoilers from the first episode)\r\nAn anime called Goblin Slayer, which main character\u2019s name is Goblin Slayer and indeed the plot is mostly about \u2013you know what?\u2013 yes, slaying some goblins. \r\nIt follows the story of the Priestess, after a savageencounter with goblins that her party was trying to kill; they suffered of the real nature of the goblins, species that aren\u2019t mild in any way. In a quick rush her party is wiped the fuck out of the dungeon and appears our cool-badass guy named Goblin Slayer, who due to a childhood trauma has its own stuff against the little green guys.\\n\\n\r\nThe setting of this anime is simply awesome; it is a fantasy Dungeons and Dragons setting full of its magical creatures; dragons, goblins, ogres, etc. So why give it a 5/10? Sure, the story never advances, it is such a great an awesome world but episode after episode we get to see the same five guys killing the same stuff with one or two twists or bosses which no one really cared about.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s simple: it\u2019s an action - fantasy anime in 2018, it\u2019s a must that we need to have some good animation with great character designs and great art overall; but it is not. Goblin Slayer only feels like an old anime, its CGI is poorly done and it never gets that feeling that actually is worth watching, it is simply bad.\\n\\n\r\nOverall characters designs are ok, but nothing impressive, backgrounds and enemies designs are well too.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing that kept me going forward of every single episode was its soundtrack. Wow.\\n\r\nMili\u2019s job on the opening theme and insert songs through episode seven and twelve are quite superb and beautiful. The overall soundtrack is so well put that really feels great. The ending theme \u201cGin no Kisei\u201d is your average shounen-style ending but it is really good as well.\\n\r\nThumbs up on the soundtracks and opening \u2013 ending themes, it\u2019s a really well done stuff.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5/10 (SPOILERS)\\n\\n\r\nGoblin Slayer offers little to nothing character development, asides for Goblin Slayer himself (who is the only one who gets developed but it is poorly made though) and a mediocre development to the Priestess, it is not good at all.\\n\\n\r\nI must give our main character thumbs up here, not for its development and not even for its background which only made him become emotionless and careless about most of the stuff, but because he is not your typical overpowered pussy slayer that just keeps going on killing and gaining glory out of it. Yes it may look overpowered to our poor green midgets but it is only due to he is overtrained, we see him getting the shit out of every goblin he sees and getting his ass beat out by some other monster such as the ogre or even the champion from episode seven.\\n\r\nAsides from that, characters that may seem important are not, and the ones who don\u2019t look important aren\u2019t important either. Such wasted resources.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nGoblin Slayer premiered with one of the best first episodes an anime could have, in my humble opinion. But as the anime kept going it was just simply boring and senseless to watch.\\n\r\nYes, after that we get to episode seven which also was one of the best episodes I\u2019ve seen and the last one was also really great, what is sad about all of this is that the series could have gone better if all episodes were like these three.\\n\\n\r\nIt is enjoyable? It is indeed but only in a couple or three episodes max. Others are simply boring, senseless and emotionless, not even worth watching.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe anime we thought would be a great masterpiece, Goblin Slayer didn\u2019t fear on its first episode to murder, rape, show some pee and the gross real nature of the goblins. So we actually though that it\u2019ll keep the same stuff, and we were asking for it, we only got some boring battles and useless speech, with zero context and with poorly developed characters and series overall. Should give it a try? I don\u2019t think so, there may be some other animes out there that you could be watching right now, so I would give it a no-no watch here.\\n",

            "content": "These series got hyped up of people are not really into anime or have watched truly great one in its category, il say it. It is not good as people say, partly why im gonna say it is because i've read the original and compared them both maybe that is what ruined the experience but at the same time im still gonna review it as completely diffrent product and give comparisons to the manga\r\nStory: I believe it has like 4 arcs beginning from introduction to the main part of slaying goblins in diffrent areas and for diffrent motives simple yet it works like a charmconnecting to characters. In the manga some episodes are added in between anime must have skipped it and they also switched some arc side from 2-3 so its kinda first arc then third second and fourth, they've done it to introduce characters early on. Show sadly begins to gradually fall after 6th episode or 3rd arc (sewer stage)\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation: I've had really big hopes in this one since i hoped it will have unique dark style like berserk 96 or something like it instead it got regular art style that added blood and little gore with above average animation that still doesnt exceeds of my expectation from anime that has alot of combat and movement, also btw it has 3D goblin slayer which looks bad as hell, they probably thought 3d goblin slayer would look cooler. In manga what i've noticed it had really great camera angles which turned our imagination to know what he did how combat went by the looks of it, they removed it and budgeted out on this part hard.\\n\\n\r\nSound: This one should be metal or atleast rock of somekind that immerses us in it, tranqulity music would even fit now and then. Instead we got crappy Japanese based anthem/pop style songs from op to the credits. Lost potential here.\\n\\n\r\nWell atleast we got characters here dont we ? Well kinda the main premise with this anime/manga is the main character of his coolness and what not its hard to rate him here but il begind how he is in manga: He has no voice, you are his voice that you are reading, actions speak louder than words. His character here is ruined by 70% he speaks way too much and characters are evolves too damn slow.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end no one is gonna do it but read the original you wont regret it, this product works as commercial but does not stands on his own feet while having manga looking at him overall poor anime. You better of watching ''Hai to Gensou no Grimgar'' aka ''From Ashes and Illusions'' diffrent experience and more enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n",

Its not unbearable to watch but if you expect to get anything more than entertainment value, you will find yourself disappointed.\r\nWhy:\r\nThe main character single mindedly kills only goblins (duh). This comes to a point that this character has little more than an inciting story as to why he kills them obsessively. Literally, there isnt anything more behind him. \r\nYou can boil down every other character into being tropes and cardboard. The healer is the usual \"maiden\", the elf is the usual precision guided archer, thedwarf is... basically a dwarf. Literally nothing new.\\n\\n\r\nFor some reason they toss in key plot elements (like concrete) that'd have zero situational relevance other than to address future problems which is entirely lazy story writing. \"hmm lets take a canary into a tunnel... which i never do, ever.... i wonder why i'm doing this.... oh and concrete too.... what else... you know just in case.\" \\n\\n\r\nUpsides? The story makes sense, the characters arent entirely OP, and it at least plays out nicely. That's basically the least you could ask.",

            "content": "I'm not really sure what to say here. There are plenty of reviewers who rated this lowly and tried to not very subtly hide their reasons for actually disliking the show. There are goblins and goblins rape and kill, people die. This show actually goes into the details many other fantasy settings are actually afraid of getting in to. The dark parts of the adventurer world. I wouldn't even call it \"edgy\" it simply gives a glance of the realities and dangers of adventuring. Id consider it actually very realistic and well thought out. The main character uses his head to get through situations, heis not super strong just someone who has mastered the skill of hunting goblins. The story focuses around that aspect, delves into his history and reasons, and slowly shows his growth as a person throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nI would probably consider this to be one of the best if not the best anime of the fantasy-type other world adventure animes. To me art matters a lot. The art style in this show is very well done, and the attention to detail is exquisite. There are some aspects which use CG and that could have been done better. But to me it's not very noticeable.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is great, I actually became a fan of Mili, the person who does the opening and ending soundtracks, because of this series.\\n\\n\r\nThe characterization is detailed. The characters all have their own unique personalities, and many people who are even simply background characters you get to know of and feel like you have a subtle understanding of them. You can easily see the growth of the characters as the series progresses and watching the growth of characters is also one of the parts I enjoy. There is a quirk where none of them are actually named though.\\n\\n\r\nI really did enjoy this series and look forward to the next season. If you don't enjoy death or tough realities and hardships in your anime then feel free to skip this. But I hope you are able to leave personal reasons such as politics if you do.\\n\\n",

This anime tackles it in its own form and way(though only indirectly), which is something I found very fascinating. In the last episode, the hero says \"It would suck if the town was destroyed though the world is saved\", which adds to the point I am trying to make. This is just the start of many good things anime tries to tackle.\\n\r\nAs for the rating, \\n\r\nAnimation: 8 (it's on the better side), \\n\r\nMusic: 10 (I enjoyed it a lot)\\n\r\nStory: 9 the plot is an 8 at its best, but the presentation is unique earning it a 9\\n\r\nCharacters Designs: 8 some characters are quite unique (the smoke lady adventurer) and others the usual stereotypes, but they fit the plot well\\n\\n\r\nThough I do think there are some things that creators have added to attract customers (the usual stuff) but the issue is that they don't fit the characterizations imo (the three female characters; village girl and the two priestess characters and their animation models are not exactly complimenting each other), I can see why they are designed as such, but doesn't make it any good.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6 To be fair art on its own is quite good, but the because of the above-mentioned issue that it didn't complement the characters well in those cases, This is where I had to compromise myself in giving an overall 8 though I feel it deserves better\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7 Let's keep it diplomatic and give the 7, whether someone enjoys this some or not is completely personal and I myself have no problem watching gore.",

            "content": "Right from the very start Goblin Slayer had an infamous reputation, due to a pretty disturbing to some opening episode. The general disgust towards *that* scene was really overblown. And the scene was really short. If anything, I appreciate it, because it shows right from the start that the show can be rather dark and that this fantasy world is not all lighthearted, as there are plenty such shows.\r\nGoblin Slayer is a series about, as the title says, goblin slaying. There isn't, in terms of story, much more to it. It might not sound overly exciting, but it is pretty interesting and, in my opinion,worth watching. At the end of the day it all depends on your preferences though.\\n\\n\r\nIf you think about it, the story is rather bland. Goblin Slayer takes quests to slay goblins, at first alone, later on with a party. There is no connection between the quests except for character introductions really. The show barely focuses on worldbuilding. There are many references to D&D, like 'gods rolling a dice' or something. It is made pretty clear, especially at the very last episode, what this series is based on. \\n\r\nThere are 'filler' episodes, in a sense that the party is refilling equipment, repairing gear or just chilling/partying. What I find most interesting is that the MC-kun is very clearly specified to not be a special individual in the world, as there are heroes who literally save the world when he's on a goblins quest. The season doesn't end on a cliffhanger, rather the opposite - I'd say it ends in a satisfying way. Although more is always welcome, I'd be fine if it ended here, because there aren't really any unanswered questions or unaddressed plot points that come to mind.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of animation, there is CGI but not that much and it's not terrible. 2D animation however is pretty good. It's not the most detailed or anything but it certainly shouldn't bug your mind. There is a lot of blood. Very gory scenes are censored fairly well. Overall, the animation certainly fits with the theme of the show. It doesn't have the highest budget ever but is consistently good.\\n\\n\r\nWhen the show wants to be 'badass', it is. With the help of really fitting soundtracks. Again, not masterpieces or something stellar, they get the job done and get you excited and hyped for the action scene. Voice actors portrayed their characters really well.\\n\r\nSpeaking of soundtracks, both opening and ending songs are really good. I often find myself listening to them.\\n\\n\r\nI've seen many comparisons between Goblin Slayer (we don't even know his name) and Guts. In my opinion, it is stupid. GS and Berserk are two entirely different series and the characters don't have much in common, except for endurance and *maybe* personality (again, only because Guts isn't the most talkative person in the world). Speaking of GS, he doesn't have much of said personality. He usually replies with just 'I see.' or 'Okay.' or 'Really?' when it comes to daily conversations. He may sound like a boring character, which he might be, but his bland personality is sometimes pretty hilarious. He starts off as a loner, however as the story goes on, we see him learn the importance of nakama, friends, etc. He starts caring about his party even if he doesn't outright say so. Also, the last arc was basically dedicated to save his childhood friend. In battle however, he is the one who comes up with a plan and provides much knowledge on goblins.\\n\r\nWe also given hints on what made GS the way he is - obsessed with goblin slaying, not talkative, etc but there also is a spin-off manga focusing on his backstory.\\n\\n\r\nGoblin Slayer, a few episodes in, forms a party of four. While they are not developed much as well, they bring an interesting dynamic to the group and I found myself actually caring for them, their interactions with each other are always fun. In battle they bring interesting strategies and abilities. Characters didn't really grow very much in terms of writing, but they didn't need to, in my opinion. It's not a show you watch if you want to witness complex characters anyway and it wouldn't really fit into the general theme and story.\\n\\n\r\nWhen the show is serious, it is pretty badass. There was never a time when I felt like skipping an episode or even a scene. Where it fails in character depth/worldbuilding/telling an incredible story, it makes up with hype moments and really enjoyable battles, interactions between characters.",

            "content": "Well it's time for your generic everyday isekai anime.\r\n*Begins Goblin Slayer*\r\nHmm this looks alright for... holy sh*t why- OH OH NO, WHY IS- oh ok just a rape scene.\r\nStory 5/10\r\nThis story is nothing special. It is stated in the name of the anime itself, a Goblin, Slayer. It's about a guy that slays goblins. Whether the slaying be in one episode or a full three there is enough slaying of goblins for the entire family to enjoy! This show begins of just like your normal isekai anime, but it turns for the worse when the idea of rape and naked girls is brought into thepicture. Now this is where many people have a problem with the show, but I don't see it. You have shows like Berserk that show just the same kind of things, if not worse, but you see that show getting praise while Goblin Slayer is all hate. I personally haven't seen Berserk the anime but I have read several chapters in the manga, but I digress. You have small 'arcs' if you would like to call them in Goblin Slayer, which is basically just a quest. The longest one is the quest they take to slay Goblins under a city, offered by a High Priestess. This High Priestess is apparently important, but we only see her for, like, two episodes so I don't get it. Of course every show of this kind has to have it's epic battle to end the show and I'm going to be honest, I quite liked it. It lasted for the last two episodes and I liked to see all of the characters come back for one final battle with everyone. Summary: In the end, one could pick up an episode at the beginning of a quest, watch the single quest alone, and get satisfaction. For me specifically, this story was not the most memorable thing in the world. For these reasons, it is a 5/10.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\r\nThis won't be as long as the Story paragraph, and I'll try to keep it short. This art style has elements of your normal isekai, but not as stand out-ish as other isekai like konosuba. This is most likely because of the darker tone of Goblin Slayer, but the mix of vibrant colors along with darker, less saturated colors mixes for a great world. I feel the CGI for Goblin Slayer's armor is one of the better instances of CGI in anime. Certainly not the best, but definitely not the worst. Summary: A nice combination of colors, along with the character design and CGI, give Art an 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\r\nThe Opening and Ending were something to skip over. While the OP is definitely better than the ED, I found that I skipped over the Opening 9/12 episodes (1,11,12 are the three I didn't skip) and skipped over the ending 12/12 episodes. What really earns the high rating is the Sound Effects and VA. I really don't have any complaints for any of the Voice Actors, however some were just alright. The Sound Effects, such as the goblins and the death of them, are very good and sometimes I even jumped a little when after a quite moment a goblin sound would play. Summary: Because the OP and ED were easily skippable, but the sound effects and Voice Actors were very good, Sound ends at a 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 6/10 (I purposely botch the names)\\n\r\nThis is kind of a mixed bag for me. On one hand you have very in depth characters, and on the other you have \"likes person because anime\". Of course you have the classic characters such as Mr. Dense Protagonist, Holy Girl who might like Goblin Slayer-san but is never said because PLOT, Ms. Elf Lady who says no fire water or poison, Mr. Drunk Dwarf (who also gets into fights with Elf Lady), and Cheese Loving McGee.These 5 are who you follow through the majority of the show, not really learning about who they are, where they come from, their backstory (except for Mr. Dense Boy), or in some cases how they met. Where does Cheese Loving McGee come from and why does he love Cheese? How did Elf Lady and Drunk Dwarf end up in the same party? These questions and many more are never solved in the series, even though the directors could've taken maybe 1 or 2 episodes to go in depth about them towards the beginning of the show. Even Ms. Farm Tit has more character development than Elf Lady, who has more screen time in one episode than she has in her entirety. Side characters seem to have also been included simply for the reason of being 'comedic effect' or rivalry for some girl. Summary: While maybe 1 or 2 characters are gone into development, the rest are not. However, because they are memorable characters, Character gets a 6/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10\\n\r\nFor as much as I've been writing the negatives of the show, I did happen to enjoy it quite a bit. Enjoyment is the only relative part of a review so I will sum it up in the following statement. Summary: Because of memorable characters, great art and sound design, characters who keep me wondering who they are, amongst other reasons, my Enjoyment is a 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nThank you everyone for reading my 2nd review. I am still new to the whole thing so I may not have written in the best way possible.",

            "content": "Status: Episode 8\r\nGoblin Slayer - Oh boy, what kind of anti-Goblin propaganda is this show?\r\nIf there is any anime this year that deserves the title \u201cBlack Sheep\u201d, then you should look no further. So before we talk about what has the show done to earn that title, let us talk about the rest. I'm not avoiding it, I'm only saying that this review is going to focus on the other elements. But oh I promise, we will get to that scene.\r\nGoblin Slayer is fantasy world where the gods plays dice, people and other creature live in a society of ignorance and where Goblins arethe worst enemy any beginner could ever encounter. Just look at the little blue mage hood here, she lost her first party to these goblin. And these Goblins doesn\u2019t mess around. Luckily she is saved by not Lancelot. Btw, not Lancelot is our true main character. His main quest is one thing and one thing only, killing all of the Goblins. And not just the men, but the women and the children, too. They're like animals, and HE slaughtered them like animals. \\n\r\nHE hates them!.\\n\\n\r\nOf course not Lancelot is joined by other Not-people who you might recognized as Not 2B, Not Guts and Not Dog.\\n\\n\r\nNow let\u2019s talk about Not-Lancelot, the Goblin Slayer, our main character. He is awesome. Despite what I said about this shows own agenda, he\u2019s a good hunter. He knows not to be too careless, he gets the job done in a efficient way and he is not afraid to finish the job even if it has some moral obstacle. People like to compare him to the Doom guy because of his hatred and attitude against enemies, but that he is more caution and plan ahead. Personally I would say that he is more like a diet Guts from Berserk, since Doom Guy I know is that kind of guy who would turn a pillow into a weapon if he ram it hard enough.\\n\\n\r\nTo follow up on this anti-Goblin propaganda, our main character seems to be intentionally building his own harem. Yeah you will see that all the girls he gets contact to him, will start to fall in love for him. I mean he does have a job, but it\u2019s not a job I would see that would attract many wanted attention. I guess it\u2019s true what they say; Fall for the goal and girls will fall for you. But Goblin Slayer doesn\u2019t care of all the thots in thotsville, he just wants to kill all of the Goblin. Which makes me wonder if he ever will come across a female Goblin.\\n\\n\r\nFor the rest of the cast, I see them most as supporters than characters of their own. There\u2019s of course nothing wrong with that. What I am saying is that seeing who is the guy who calls the shoots is always the Goblin Slayer, regardless how experience the rest of the other party members are in their area. Maybe I\u2019m too used to teams that everyone is special (question mark)\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is decent, yet seems to be not on the same level as the manga expected it to be. Some moments where characters supposedly to have extraordinary reaction has been tooned down. Some of the fights looks more stale and has less things going for them. Even with Goblin Slayer being as a 3D models, he doesn't move as that much. Yet it still noticeable when 3D is switched to 2D. It's not Berserk level but it's not great either. There is also a moment in episode 7 where we stare at some birds eyes as nothing is happening in it\u2019s reflection. Okay...\\n\\n\r\nMy biggest concern of the animation or editing is however on this moment, just watch.\\n\\n\r\n[Scene where Rat is smashed]\\n\r\n[Laughs]\\n\\n\r\nThey zoomed in on his face! Not like a trick where they changed the shoot, they grabbed their video software and just zoomed on his face like an armature!\\n\\n\r\nI know I do it sometimes, but a professional studio? Da fuck ha [Laughs]\\n\\n\r\nThe opening is good, it begins with slow and quiet, until it turns into sharp as the beat speeds up. The ending seems nice as well, I like the helmets point of view.\\n\\n\r\nOkay now that we have gone through the most of it, let\u2019s talk about the scene. \\n\\n\r\nDuring the failed attempt to slay Goblins in the first episode, one of the party member, who was the female fighter who knew self defence, had her cloth ripped right out off her, bend over in doggy style and raped by goblins. Yes you heard it right, a girl, who was around 15 years old, was raped on screen. \\n\\n\r\nWhat. the. fuck! \\n\\n\r\nNow I just want to make things clear; this show was aired late night and we didn't see the stick go in the jam. Yet seeing how suggestive this scene was, we can understand perfectly that this was a rape scene.\\n\\n\r\nLet me tell something. First; #NotAllGoblins Not all Goblins are depicted as violent, barbaric rapists made of deepest evil you ever can think of. I know Goblins who are hard working, social competence and not at all acting as they are depicted in lore. My goblin friends are offended as hell and no matter of time is this anime ever gonna regain people trust.\\n\\n\r\nSecond on a more serious note; First impression is very important. I mean, very important. Your first impression is what people will think of you the first time seeing you in action. If you are running towards the people you\u2019re gonna meat with a hot dog in your hand, you are gonna be known as the hot dog guy. And here, this series will also be known for as having a rape scene in the first episode. Yeah, fans are gonna have a hard time convincing the general public to that this anime isn\u2019t trash from what they heard about the first episode. And if you are going to convince people, please only use this anime in your argument. Don't use whataboutism, it doesn't strengthen your argument consider how other shows are different in story and character. Especially if the show is Berserk.\\n\\n\r\nThe point I\u2019m coming across here is that I don\u2019t have a problem with having a rape scene, you can have them. The problem here is how it was handled. Rape is one of the those subject that are very sensitive for the general audience. It\u2019s one of the mines in the minefield that could really blow up if you don\u2019t handled it well. And from the reaction, we can assume that Goblin Slayer didn\u2019t handle it well. I am not saying that it promotes rape, What I am saying that it wasn\u2019t use for anything else than that just to established the goblins naughtiness. Think about, what other points was it to show an on screen rape? I mean, there must be some purpose other than show it than just imply she was raped. Was it for the female fighter? No, we never see her again. Yeah, as much some like to praise this series for showing character with trauma, they seemed to just cast away this perfect example of a character going through a traumatic experience. \\n\\n\r\nImage people who wanted to see the this gimmick, image going through episodes without seeing another goblin rape scene again? Damn it! I was promised goblins on girl action, why do not serve me more of those scenes? My pants are down now show me the goodie! If you are going to have a gimmick, then you better focus on that gimmick on the first episodes. Sure you kill goblins, but when are we gonna see goblin fuck again? This expectation has made me look at the female cast as potential goblin victims. Oh a new female character, is she gonna be Goblin food? I see a character with big breasts, is she the new plaything for the goblins? And I am not comfortable with this.\\n\\n\r\nNow this wouldn\u2019t had blown up as hard as it did, if it wasn\u2019t for Crunchyroll putting the wrong age-restriction. Now you could say that Crunchyroll wasn\u2019t aware that the anime was going to have that scene due to how they publishes the anime 1 hour after it has been released in japan. That\u2019s fine and all. What I am saying is that the anime is based on a manga and light novel, which is accessible for everyone to see. You see what I mean? If I could find the translated chapters within 4 minutes, then Crunchyroll should had no problem doing the same. This should had been done much earlier than what has happened.\\n\\n\r\nThis only stress the problem with that I mentioned before, the story seems to only be interested in Goblin Slayer and none of the other characters if doesn\u2019t involve our hero. Lil mage gets a time-skip after her first encounter, which is direct after she has witness people getting raped and murdered. Btw did I mention this was her first time, and she seems to be fine afterwards. Yeah yeah you get used to it, I understand. What I am concerned about, since I didn\u2019t read the manga or light novel, is that if this series has any chapter or episode dedicated to someone else than Goblin Slayer. \\n\\n\r\nMaybe that the point, question mark?\\n\\n\r\nBut hey, it only have been a few episodes so far. Maybe in some weeks it might get to the point of being a dark fantasy deconstruction that some people call it. But as far as I have seen it, it\u2019s too mediocre for my taste. #NotAllGoblins\\n",

            "content": "It is a very mediocre anime that many over hype because of the adult material. \r\nThe characters are very bland. Goblin Slayer himself has a generic backstory with generic story beats that do not really get expanded upon in any meaningful way. It is a story about killing Goblins and they are not very interesting characters to watch die themselves. There is no moral ambiguity to their extermination, even when it tries to paint one. It is a fantasy, which is fine, to appeal to the younger audience trying to see something adult, but without any actual nuance into what depicting these adult themes actuallymeans. Pretty generic. You can watch it and you will get some morbid entertainment out of it which is completely fine, but don't go in expecting anything happy, nuanced, or well put together. It is just killing some generic bad guys. \\n\\n\r\nI guess I should also talk about the rape thing. Yes, there is rape and it is kind of disgusting how it is portrayed. Granted, there is not much of it, but what is depicted is depicted in such a way that tries to make it sexually satisfying for the viewer with editing and angles. It will get comparisons to Berserk, but every girl who is raped is never really heard from again so you do not actually get to explore this theme in any meaningful way and it does not add to any of the actual threats the party faces. So, with the fact that there is a constant rape threat from Goblins and the women in this anime are depicted so sexually at almost every moment imaginable, for really no reason other than to gratify the viewer, with the addition that the only time anything sexual shown is rape (I think you will get the picture); it is normalizing a disturbing pornographic fantasy at its worst and at its least it is depicting something very delicate so badly to a point of glorifying it.",

This series is causing a lot of noise for a certain \"shocking\" scene, which seems to be playing a big role to cover for how garbage this series is. One could remove it, and you would still get the arguably worst anime of the year. \r\nStory: \r\nNo story to talk about. It's just about a guy who slays goblins, and it's done in the worst possible way one could think of.  There is no lack of awful fantasy light novels, but you will have extreme difficulty to find a less imaginativeand shallow story as the one found in this abortion of an anime. Now add the generic harem romcom elements to the story because why not? It can't get worse, right? Well, yes, it actually does when the anime jump from being \"dark\" (This anime is NOT dark, but it's for the example sake) at one moment and then to a romcom in another moment. Laughable (1/10)\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound:\\n\\n\r\nAverage to below average. Not bad, but there is nothing notable to talk about here. (4/10)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nBland. The main character is the worst offender. He is a flat character with no personality to speak of, who is bent on slaying goblins. The MC harem and other characters introduced aren't much better and are as boring as the Goblin Slayer. They are cliched and have no depth at all.

            "content": "This anime is about rape and killing goblins. The end.\r\nI wish there was more than that, but sadly, it's just the perfect anime to watch while looking at your favourite social media. It's original in its way but that's not enough.\r\nWhile I was, of course, surprised too by the scenes of the first episode, which was a perfect 10, I was not necessarily disgusted or against that. And I HATE oversexualized scenes and characters, but this parts are done with a purpose: to show how dark a dangerous a fantasy world could actually be.\r\nThis is the first high point of Goblin Slayer. Yes, it hassome high points. The second one, is the action scenes. Very good visuals, gore nicely done, good sound, pace and they are very entertaining overall.\\n\\n\r\nThe low points are really really low and the most important ones: Story and Characters... and of course, some oversexualized characters but now with no  sense and purpose to make the story even less serious.\\n\\n\r\nStory (NO SPOILERS): The main character, Goblin Slayer, wants to kill all the Goblins because of what they did to his village and family when he was a kid. I watched 9 and it doesn't develop further than that. You could say it has no story and I wouldn't totally disagree with you.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Goblin Slayer travels with 4 other \"party\" members of which just one is meeted in a interesting way. None of them are interesting. The secondary characters are even worse, they compete to see who is the worst of them and the Witch is winning by far.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum up, Goblin Slayer is a non-Isekai anime that has similar elements to the ones that are, but by not being one and monsters not being made by computer, they are completly savage and organized in several different ways... sadly all the monsters we see are goblins.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime won't be remembered for other than it's violence. The presentation and proposal of its dark fantasy world is very good and could be inspiring for others in the future, but in this case, it was terribly developed. It gets a 6 and no less 'cause like I mentioned, it's original in its way and for the good fights that makes it enjoyable for 10 minutes every 2 weeks.",

            "content": "One of the best ways to describe this year of 2018 for anime is with this very title, \"Goblin Slayer\". A series which started with such a smack, it ruptured the guts of the anime community. Before then slowly abseiling off the metaphorical cliff to the comfortable cliches below. Such a huge disappointment, but I feel that's been most of this year in terms of anime. Good starting series' only to start pissing me off half way through by showing their reliance on old tired tropes. It makes me wonder; \"why are am I watching this?\" Goblin Slayer isn't that bad a experience however itdoes point out this underlying problem. Anime nowadays is all about making that 'all important' CASH, MONEY! \\n\\n\r\nIn episode 4 the themes and characters begin to get stagnant as the story takes a lengthy detour, hoping to elongate the mystery of the Goblin Slayer and who he is. After introducing  very 1 dimensional characters, placed into a newly, disconnected plot. Why? Why is this now ha- Oh...to fill up time so the audience doesn't ask to many questions before becoming disinterested in the plot because your not going to give them any answer and are hoping to make more money in a season 2... *Gasp* Guess that makes sense.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, by episode 6 I start getting bored with this lacking and disinterested story and main lead, GOBLIN SLAYER! Who's seriously starting to become annoying at this point, generally caused by his overly calm demeanor which at first is intriguingly presented but by episode 6, I could care less, just like GOOOBLAM SALUR!. Which is why this \"new\" plot hurts the flow of the anime. Nothing seems to change and appears to have one purpose; to lengthen that answer to that question of who the Goblin Slayer is. By the time they start giving us (or me) a little more to chew on, its already episode 8! Eight!? Not 4 or 5 or even 6, but 8? This dangling of a carrot has been in front of me for the whole narrative journey, and anytime I show interest, that metaphorical carrot gets moved, yet again!\\n\\n\r\nEven-though I hate the flow of the narrative and its lack of progression, I hate lazy writing and I hate the bland characters. Still, I'm going to continue watching to see how it finishes. Maybe I'm hoping to have some of questions answered or perhaps I just want to give credence to why I didn't really like it.\\n",

I didn't after the fiasco that Darling in the Franxx caused in 2018, there was any anime would come out this year that would have everyone in the community talk about it. Well Goblin Slayer has manages to done that. Now is it the best thing to come out of the fantasy/MMORPG genre or plain worst anime in the history. If anyone asked me, i would describe the Goblin Slayer anime after five episodes in one word: AVERAGE. Yes, it's just an average showwhich just has a bit more edge over most shows of the same genre. Now let's break down the Goblin Slayer anime.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThere is an old saying that you can not judge a book by its cover. Well Goblin Slayer disagrees with that. It is what is on the tin. An anime about slaying Goblins. In this anime Goblins are not your absolute weak tier10 monsters. They are evil and a bit smart( not to mention too horny) and the anime is about dealing with them. While simple stories can be great with good execution, Goblin Slayer till now has handled it averagely not making the story stand out. Five episodes in, the world building hasnt been upto the mark or the execution hasnt been spot on. However this could have been worse.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is the strongest point of the Goblin Slayer anime. While the art isn't something revolutionary, it is on point. The color contrasts are on point with the tones of the show and animation never seems half-hearted. Considering the year 2018, the art of the show is upto the mark. White Fox haven't half-assed the project just because this was something untested.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nNot much to say about the sound of the show. Okay OST, decent OP, not so decent ED. Considering it was produced by White Fox, I expected a bit more on the sound department as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is where the show has a huge flaw. If you are making a good anime, you should be invested in the characters by episode 4-5. But five episodes in, there is nothing that would make you root for or feel a connection with any of the characters. Before you go and say read the manga/LN or wait a bit, Good anime always make sure you have some investment in the show important characters. All the characters in the show are one note. Character interactions seem forced. The characters are making the show suffer.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nDespite of heavily criticizing Goblin Slayer, i would say this. I did enjoy it quite a bit. It isn't something extraordinary. But if you have free time, you can give the show a go.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nNow before giving an overall rating and review of the show lets discuss a few things first. First comes the infamous rape scene. Is it the worst thing to happen in anime? Well, no. There have been far worse execution of rape scenes in anime I can think of(every other edgelord anime). Goblin Slayer, however is not one to be up there among those. Hell, even Berserk despite of being so good, didnt do an excellent job at that. So just dissing the anime on basis of the rape scene only isn't right. Goblin Slayer used simple shock factor to draw in an audience successfully. But is it really that good? The answer here will also be no. Shows like Re:Zero and Made in Abyss have shown you dont need to rely solely on shock factor to establish a brutal fantasy world. Sadly, without its shock factor, Goblin Slayer cannot establish its brutality. Overall, it is just an average show that only a teenager would think that its the best or worst thing to happen in anime.",

            "content": "What is the path of gaining popularity in matter of no time? By doing something extreme, of course. Goblin Slayer nailed with the first episode by exceeding in unnecessary amount of violence and gore, which disgusted some people not because tons of gore is a nasty thing, but because many parts had terrible action (usually two characters are fighting while others are waiting for their turn, or someone goes banzai and dies in an instant), awfully made protagonist and antagonists.\r\nThe story is cliche as it can be, generic fantasy world with names like kingdom of elves, they didn't even bother naming kingdoms (not mentioning nonexistentnames of the characters), already seen and used races like dwarves, humans, elves, argonians... umm I mean lizards, etc. Races want to survive and of course evil creatures such as goblins and demons want to ruin everything, so they fight. There is adventurer's guild with a plenty of quests which offer rewards, though it looks like typical high school show - boasting jocks, an elite group which despises others, which wasn't necessary at all... \\n\r\nThe characters don't have names. We know someone's race and age, bit of protagonist's past, and that's mostly it. The conversations are usually dull, it's either talk about how bad goblins are, pathetic  bantering between the elf and the dwarf, or when the protagonist replies with one or two words to everything. The other problem with characters is such awful design (especially the voice) of goblins, not just that they look like someone with no imagination created them, they don't leave any impression of posing a threat with their pathetic figure and voice. Swiper from Dora the Explorer looks scarier than the goblins. Also, the logic about protagonist and his armour is ridiculous, but I guess he needs to look like a tough guy who doesn't talk much to leave cool impression. Never taking his armour off, even helmet, while helmets were worn only during the battle or duty as a guard, eating (not even removing his visor) and sleeping in armour and helmet looks more silly than cool and tough. \\n\\n\r\nWith all these flaws, it's not a terrible show. The first episode was a teaser that the show will be dark and full of gore and other nasty things, but it hasn't shown any more depth than that. Characters with no names, kingdoms with no names, even the dark theme started fading away with the annoying elf and the atmosphere is changing. Dark theme is getting thinner and the show is shifting into a forgettable seasonal anime with some adventure time and action, nothing more.\\n\\n\r\nI guess there will be some demon master who summons evil creatures to take over the world and eliminate all the races or turn them into slaves, the protagonist will probably have another scroll to use as a trump card and poof, the end.",

            "content": "\"A BARRACK OF SWORDS AND SORCERY HOLDING JAPANESE SWAMP UNDER THE FLOOR\"\r\nOn a story posting site, there submitted an amateurish simple draft like a rough dry trail. To tailor it into a suite of animation series, it is necessary to flesh out with ideas which were not given by the original plotter. What this production team chose was...\r\nIn the characteristics of Japanese ghost stories and Japanese horror movies, there is an element, which is always pointed out. To say, \"dampness\".\r\nIn the dictionary sense, it appears to be \"water\". Half of it is from the climate and a depressing mood (such as quiet eeriness) made bythat. The other half is body fluid of human. Cold sweat on the back, dry swallow in tense, striking nausea in the stomach, the sudden eruption of hot flashes, feeling slippy hands holding the shaft of a weapon, sticky blood pool, tears overflowing while holding back the cry, and so on. Actors and viewers share the same kind of body fluids as humanity. They are shaken by the emotions mediated by the body fluids. The emotions that cannot be spoken are again symbolized and emphasized as the body fluids.\\n\\n\r\nA strong thought that every human being has, shaped into a certain direction by own emotions are called \"pathos\". In the type of stories like this work, \"pathos\" can be said more concisely -- \"grudge\".\\n\\n\r\nThe terse drafts, like the inscrutable iron-faced protagonist. In order to make a foothold of empathy and inflate the plot, highlighting more sympathetic characters to stir viewers' primal emotions is a proper way.\\n\r\nNot a disastrous mass destruction nor terror, but the concerns of this story are the lawless violence (sometimes organized and sometimes disorganized) also seen in this real world. What the creative team chose is simmering the grudges of the characters and the goblins, with tenacity. The dampness is its physical representation.\\n\\n\r\nSome of the audience (some are chuunibyo) assume that this \"low sugar\" mood takes on the western-medieval style hard-core fantasy with harsh realism, which landed as a counteraction of those fluffy lots of Japan-born swords-and-sorcery contents which are bright, refreshing and stress-free for an empty head (but filled with eye candies).\\n\r\nThe direct ancestor of anti-hero archetype like the protagonist of this work can be sought out on the tracks back to the Spaghetti Western movies. As you know very well, there was a period when many movies set in the West of America were produced in European countries. Contrary to the conventional stories of the high-spirited proud founders of America who have devoted their lives to the pioneering and faith, the Spaghetti Western movies portray who openly oppose the corrupted authorities, who resist racial discrimination, the Mexican heroes who lead American armies by the nose, nihilistic stylish outlaws and so on. The movies oriented to the action entertainment in the desolated frontiers.\\n\r\nSome of what the Spaghetti producers have been inspired were Akira Kurosawa's \"Yojinbo\" and those \"jidai-geki\" -- historical sword-action drama / samurai movies. On the contrary, the Spaghetti Western echoes to the Japanese drama makers. Pushing those repetitious \"moral play\" aside, stranger heroes appeared after another who live on their rules and sole own swordsmanship.\\n\r\nIt seems that the original draft of this work also took nutrients from a pool of jidai-geki, like the game masters of paper-and-pencil role-playing games prepare scenarios conceived from plots of those established plays. And the animated version is borrowing a lot from Japanese traditional standard attributes: \"damp\" and \"wet\", as mentioned.\\n\r\nEven though this is not such another tale like brave adventures of teen boys and/or girls with a critter (which are commercially proven by the video game industry as so-called \"JRPG\"s), it is also and nevertheless a work, which is undoubtedly fed by the bloodline of accustomed Japanese storytelling doctrine.\\n\\n\r\nAside from the ethical controversy, such these stories like revenge, horror or bullying which are driven by gruesome \"grudges\" are promised certain approval and success, especially in East Asia. However, the way is to immerse its knees into the warm swamp from the prehistoric era where countless previous works and tales stagnant. I still can not tell whether it breaks to a new route without getting bogged down, whether it can continue to breathe even after mired in the mushy ooze, nor whether it will be pulled into fathoms deep and buried totally.\\n\\n\r\nIt sounds very RPG-like what the protagonist refers to himself as saying, \"With new wits, it is getting pleasant to realize them to outsmart the goblins\" or \"The first adventurer who loses the ability to imagine dies first\".\\n\r\nThe protagonist allows even infant goblins no mercy. Is he an inhuman undertaker of massacres? In an interesting twist, we can see no piece of superiority complex nor consciousness of persecution within the psyche of the man. He applies himself \"I may be like a goblin for them -- the goblins\". We could sense a hint of antiseptic. This is a kind of the immaculate nature within this stained story. Doesn't he practice just as a professional pest control worker does?\\n\r\nIn this play, the roles depicting the sense of bias are arranged to the protagonist's guild peers. They contempt the goblins too, again glance the man as a crackbrain who sneaks into the stinky lairs of such the brat-like goblins day by day.\\n\r\n\"There's no hope to harmonize with the goblins\", the protagonist says. Then, how is his mind for the fellow adventurers who suffer him with prejudice? This is a focus of challenge to the audience for the ability of comprehension and insight. \"Totally indifferent\"? Alas, YOU DIED FIRST.\\n\\n\r\nTo break the endless linkage of grudges -- In short, this is the behavioral principle of the protagonist's unrelenting effort for goblin elimination.\\n\r\nIronically, a crowd of viewers is thirsting for a dank story which leads to a chain of grudges. For the moment, they jump at the waving flag over the anime production committee, who seems to lure the crowd well as planned.\\n\r\n====\\n\\n\r\n* In the finale of the fourth episode: The monologue of the elven archer launches a fresh viewpoint toward the well-worn \"adventure\" concept. Let's celebrate a joyful fledgling of philosophy.\\n\\n\r\n[Written and translated by aReviewer myself - from MAL blog entry: https://myanimelist.net/blog.php?eid=824711 ]",

            "content": "I don't really know what all the hype's about. Every scene in this show was completely predictable, every mention of something new, either a problem or a character, they instantly show them (if a woman typically with their breasts popping out). \r\nThe goblin slayers reactions to some things were a bit comical, but after the first two episodes, they became boring and redundant. The priestess was a completely useless character who's only purpose was to be shipped with the goblin slayer, she was useless in pretty much every way except for being able to create a force field which only lasted if she concentrated onit longer than a minute at most, but she couldn't hold her staff straight long enough to even do that.\\n\r\nAnd the reason I'm calling them \"goblin slayer\" and \"priestess\" is because the show actually never names them. And if they did, (along with all the other characters), they only said their names once and then instantly replaced them with either nicknames or when ever they called out to that character, that character already (somehow) knew that they were talking to them.\\n\r\nThe other characters were pretty plain as well. An elf who was useless in battle, but thought that she was more powerful than anyone, just winded up being a tsundere and another \"love interest\" towards the goblin slayer, (which who, by the way, is so dumb when it comes to sensing emotions that he can't even tell what he himself is feeling) she just became a pointless character. Then there's some kind of dwarf who's only interests are eating and drinking, along with throwing stones for attacks and sometimes being able to put goblins to sleep.\\n\r\nWhich, these goblins, are apparently some of the most powerful monsters in the show while this show mentions dragons and some kind of demon lord. And if there's one thing that this show had to do to make sure we all knew that these goblins were so terrible was to make every woman who lost against them instantly the goblins sex slaves. If this showed anymore nudity, this could be a hentai. I'm not even kidding.\\n\r\nThen onto this lizard character who is in love with cheese, and I get that's supposed to be some kind of comedic point (it's japan, I'm used to it) but it seems a bit overdone and I doubt to see how it could make anyone laugh. Other than that, he's a bit more of an interesting character. He does have some power too him, being able to summon mass amounts of strength, and skeletons to aid him (he can only cast four spells at once), however he is usually left out of the fights, put to either take care of some other stupid task, or to protect the priestess of course. \\n\r\nThe goblin slayer himself was a cliche mess. A glossed over tragic backstory, which makes him forever hate goblins, and the only thing he can think about is goblins, the only thing he speaks about are goblins, and most of the time that's all the guy says. Goblins. Fun drinking game by the way, a shot each time the show says the word \"goblin\". You'll be wasted by half of the first episode, good luck with that alcohol poisoning. \\n\r\nSpeaking of which, for some reason, the only things on every male's minds (other than the goblin slayer) is eating and drinking. While all the girls want to get in the goblin slayers pants, for some unknown reason.\\n\r\nWhich leads me onto the third to the last character. Some chick who was a hero a while ago, and killed the demon lord.\\n\r\nBasically a replica of the priestess except taller, bigger boobs, blind, and wants to get into the goblin slayer's pants a bit more. Apparently she got raped by some goblins a while ago and is terrified by them, and now that there's goblins in her city, she can't do shit even though she fought and killed the god of death.\\n\r\nThen there's another girl (also wants to have fuck the goblin slayer) and works the guild where the goblin slayer goes to get requests to kill more goblins. She's a thing, although a bit of a pointless character, and sends the priestess out (as soon as she meets her, and the priestess has never had any adventuring training) to fight goblins, knowing very well that the priestess will probably die.\\n\r\nI'm saving my favourite character for last, (I'm only calling her my favourite because she has the biggest breasts, isn't that annoying, and is the only character I wouldn't mind seeing be with the goblin slayer. Because, yes, like every other woman in this show, she likes the goblin slayer.) \\n\r\nShe's the goblin slayers child hood friend, and she lives with him along with her uncle. She likes him, and it's so painfully obvious, that I don't know why she hasn't made a move yet. It's pretty clear he isn't. \\n\r\nBut besides all of this, I watched the entirety of the show. Even though I knew what was going to happen, the characters were cliche, and it nothing in the show or story was very creative, it didn't get to the point of so boring that I could finish the first twelve episodes.\\n\r\nI'd rate this a three out of ten, I only watched it because I'm sick, and it's my tradition to watch a new anime each time I'm sick. There you go.",

            "content": "It took me a bit to get Goblin Slayer's actual appeal points and it's greatest strengths, but thanks to that I think I've gained an even bigger appreciation for this series. The original manga is supposedly very gory and disturbing, but the anime tones that aspect down a bit - the fights are still bloody and brutal, but torture and rape (which are important to the whole setup, as they explain the nasty nature of goblins and the danger they represent) are shown explicitly only in the opening episode. The rest of the content is simply a fantasy adventure, with the protagonist facing more andmore grim challenges and reluctantly teaming up with other heroes to overcome them.\\n\\n\r\nThe \"tabletop-session\" climate is augmented by the \"gamey\" rules of the world (like the limited number of spells characters can use per day) and very peculiar character development - pretty much everyone in the story is addressed in accordance to their function, rather than names and there's only a necessary minimum of world-building or plot progression. The only thing that really matters is the main group and the specific challenges they face, which leads to some fun interactions and highly satisfying fights.\\n\\n\r\nAnother unusual part is the protagonist, whose single-minded obsession with eradicating goblins and disinterest in the rest of the world is something I haven't really seen in a lead character. He basically only talks, walks and breaths to kill them, making for many absurd situations and dialogue (and, what's important to mention, he's really an expert at his job - a professional exterminator of sorts, but one that doesn't care about being paid or thanked for what he does). His companions have a bit more personality, but are also kept close to their respective archetypes (and that's visibly on purpose).\\n\\n\r\nEverything mentioned so far is, obviously, done with some really impressive production values. There were also some parts of the show I liked less, such as the awkward fanservice and over-stylized support characters, but generally, it was an enjoyable experience - and it should be the same for you, if you can get into the right mood and accept its peculiar formula.",

            "content": "I enjoyed Goblin Slayer honestly way more than I ever should have. I wish I could say it's a deep show or even one that's particularly special in some artistic way, but it's not. Goblin Slayer is a show with exactly one sole purpose, and that is killing goblins. In some odd way however, that singular goal alone is what makes this show enjoyable. It isn't some story about a hero saving the world, it isn't a story about some chosen one. It's a simple, mostly focused story about a man who is so deeply disturbed he does the onlything he knows how to. \\n\\n\r\n   While this show isn't perfect in any means, I found the inspiration taken from D&D to be quite fun. Just like the world of D&D, Goblin Slayer is a rough world in which terrible act occur. Personally, a darker tone is not an issue for me in a show, however I do feel like it could have been handled better. While Goblin Slayer puts fourth interesting and dark ideas, it doesn't capitalize on them as much as say something like Berserk would. \\n\\n\r\n   I can't go any longer without talking about one of the most hotly dated issues with the show though, and that is the depiction of rape in it. Now I think depicting such a topic in a show can be done right, and for the most part it is. However the one thing that turned me off of Goblin Slayer was the tone in regards to sexualization. Now the scenes themselves are not sexualized, however, there is quite an ungodly amount of fan service in this show. I'm not prude, but considering the tone this show wishes to have, it feels incredibly out of place and really took me out of it at multiple moments.\\n\\n\r\n    Overall though if you are a fan of D&D and other such roleplaying games, I would recommend at least giving it a try. If you can manage to look past some of the flaws of the show, it's a relatively enjoyable experience that has good ideas. I wouldn't say it's fantastic by any means, but I can say I got some enjoyment out of it during my time watching.",

            "content": "I have been delaying reviewing my fall shows for a while but decided to sit down and finally write them. \r\nAnyhow Goblin Slayer is a show that is heavily influenced by tabletop D&D. This influence can be seen during an episode where a magic caster explains they only can use a certain number of spells per day.  It is a different approach to the typical fantasy anime. \r\n Unfortunately, we do have to talk about what happened in the first episode and the rape stuff. To my memory, nothing is shown explicitly but it is a pretty graphic scene, and I get why therebe a debate about it. It would be something if the animation studio were trying to make a point about it or open a broader conversation, but after the first episode nothing like that shows up again.  There is a definite sense the showrunners were trying to capitalize on the shock value to get a couple more viewers or be in the spotlight.\\n\\n\r\nThere is nothing that stands out too much about the characters other than the titular Goblin Slayer.  Goblin Slayer has developed an obsession for killing goblins after the horrific rape and murder of his sister by them in an attack on his village in his youth.  Ironically, this brings up a fascinating discussion about the nature of threat. Wisecrack has a video that does a much better job explaining it than I ever could so check it out if interested. No one had proper names, just denotations of what they do, again harkening to the theme of tabletop.\\n\\n\r\nThe battle scenes are done well. It was always fun to see how Goblin Slayer went about his craft of slaying goblins or how he will thwart their machinations to kill him. \\n\r\nSoundwise, the only thing memorable to me, was the OP. I watched the Dub it did a good job nothing that would make me want to switch.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem is Goblin Slayer at the end of the day is rather a bland show nothing amazing but nothing terrible an okay show.",

Props for that, it really hooked me up there. The problem is, is that it didn't properly reflect the overall mood of the anime, which resulted in me being really disappointed and bored. The story isn't anything too special, and the characters not interesting enough that you want to get to learn them. It feels like they just put gore into it, for the sake of it having gore and a shock value to hook up watchers.It doesn't feel like it adds anything to the story and that bothers me.\\n\\n\r\nThe only reason why I'd maybe continue it, is my hope for another intense moment like the first episode, but that hope wasn't strong enough this time so I'm dropping it.\\n",

            "content": "In most fantasy, heroes kill monsters because, well, they're MONSTERS! They exist to be killed by heroes, don't they?!\r\nNot so in Goblin Slayer... Here the little green devils are shown to be a cruel and despicable menace that clearly must be dealt with by the sword. This gives the show a bit more emotional weight, at least at first.\r\nBut as much as I was prepared to love this anime, I just can't muster much enthusiasm for it in the end, because the characters are so lacking. The Goblin Slayer himself is a man of few words, and even worse, it's always the same few words!Hearing him say the same short catch phrases in response to anything that happens around him gets old real quick. This makes him incredibly lackluster and unrelatable as a main character, especially since he never removes his stupid helmet!\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast is mediocre and/or cut from the most worn fantasy tropes. None of them have much to offer in terms of personality, and it's hard to really care about any of them.\\n\\n\r\nThere are other things that went wrong with this show too, such as the fact goblins are causing a lot of suffering and death, but only the Goblin Slayer seems to care about it. This kind of inconsistency shows a broken world-building. To be honest, I think the world of GS is just a grab bag of standard fantasy tropes borrowed from everywhere, with little to no care taken to make sure it at least fits together.\\n\\n\r\nBut that doesn't really matter! I can easily forgive world inconsistencies and plot contrivances and even poorly structured writing, as long as the story is interesting and the characters relatable. Neither is the case here.\\n\\n\r\nIt's just not a very good show, but I still award it a 5, because at no point was I tempted to drop it. It has a lot of action, and it's mildly interesting to see what happens next. There's even a few semi-memorable moments sprinkled throughout the season. I'm not sure it's enough to recommend it, but it's at least enough to not warn people away. Go for it if you're in the mood for some forgettable low brow action entertainment.\\n\\n\r\nBut stay away if watching goblins get whacked triggers you! There's a lot of goblin gore on offer here. I usually stay away from gore and excessive violence, but here it's just goblins having their skulls cleaved, so I don't really care...\\n",

            "content": "Oh goodie, this is gonna be interesting considering how outspoken people have been on \"issues\" with this series or at least what they consider issues (honestly besides a few people protesting against it and those stupid \"news\" internet posting sites saying shit that isn't really news, i think the issue just got more escalated by people milking the hell out of the defense of it really so ultimately by milking its defence for what they could get out of it they probably gave those they fought about it more ground to stand on lol, conflict breeds conflict).\r\nBut anyhow let me address the biggest point guys.There was 1 rape scene (and you only really hear it not actually see it). 1. Not 5, not 3, 1. Yes there were implications and scenes of victims of rape but ultimately the series was pretty tame after that scene which suggests that it was put their to weed out anyone who would bitch about it honestly lol which i'm fine with. As for Crunchyroll not rating it correctly, i didn't watch off of them so i couldn't give a shit less lol. Crunchyroll only recently start catering to the dub market and they only did that because funimation was taken over by Sony and Sony has been making piss poor decisions lately which are causing their stocks to plummet. But crunchyroll got screwed by them so know they know they gotta get up on their dub game real quick, but let's start the actual review.\\n\\n\r\nStory: There wasn't a whole lot to the story, it was more about the characters and how they interacted with the world, not particularly how the story played out. It was basically a really basic, death heavy Dnd game and for someones whos played dnd it wasn't anything spectator. Its kinda like when there a real quest to go on and the player jus wanna go on battle side quests that have something to do with goblins and the writer knew that all to well. So i give the story a low score but like i said, it's not what makes the series, 6/10.\\n\\n\r\n Art: I would give the art a noce 8/10 BUT they overused their 3d asset \"the goblin slayer\". Anytime they had him just normal walk somewhere BAM there's that 3d version, anytime he was doing anything but standing or walking he was 2d animated which is kinda dumb. Note that the 3d model doesn't look terrible, but its also annoying to see it so often. I believe there were other instances where 3d was used, but not enough to annoy your eyes so they weren't an issue. Overall the animation wasn't always the most amazing but in comparison to other animations it was kinda basic with some gloss put on it, ESPECIALLY the opening in some places, and some of the fight scenes, so i'm gonna give it a 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I liked the opening and the music throughout was good for the atmosphere so i don't have any complaints really, i think they reused some music here and there though so 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10. The characters though not all extremely important overall gae the series something to be interested in. Overwise it would have gotten rather boring. The goblin slayer himself sorta played the straight man whenever conversing with the elf or the priestess, the dragonbor- AHEM I mean, lizardman, was kinda bland but the interactions between the dwarf and the elf made perfect sense to an dnd player and felt natural. Other characters in the world mostly felt natural as well besides a few moments so it did well to make me feel the atmosphere of the world and the environments they were in. If someone wants me to comment on how the goblins were, i'd say they acted more like goblins would then any other anime with goblin i've scene (which isn't all that many but still). \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Honestly when nothing was happening the show kinda dragged on, and when not much happened in an entire episode once i think i fell asleep and had to rewatch it. There was also a scene after the MC took a brutal blow where they paused in a far away view for a rather long time before the ending finally came, i knew it was a possible \"is he dead? \" moment but it dragged on FAR to long... Thus a 6/10, it wasn't a terrible experience but it got dull a lot which is why i think people make a bit to much out of the few scenes we saw of rape, sexual abuse and or the aftermath of rape victims, it didn't shove it in anyone's faces so it wasn't a terrible use of it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10. It wasn't bad, it wasn't great, but i had no issues really with watching it all the way through thus it was good and i'd say it was at least worth a watch through at least once, (unless your one of those people who got easily offended then i'd suggest just staying away from anime all together, go taint some other medium, like reality TV).",

Some bad-ass main character forming a party to slay some damn goblins. That's pretty good I have to say. I would like to point out some things though; if you can survive goblin slayer being disgusting CGI for the first couple of episodes in some scenes, then you are fine. However, if you can't... Hehe. Secondly, if you don't get offended by rape, you're fine. And thirdly, if you wan't a face reveal of Goblin slayer, sorry... Overall, this waspretty enjoyable and I definitely want YOU to check it out!\\n\\n\r\n- Spacecraft555 UwU",

            "content": "I initally avoided Goblin Slayer due to all the controversy. I thought it was some overhyped, edgy trash like everyone seemed to be making it out to be. I should have known better, that it could not be farther from the truth. \r\nGoblin Slayer is the breath of fresh, unadulterated, vile air in this cloistering age of hypersensitivity and social coddling. Apparently murder, violence, and death are A okay to be shown in all forms of media, and no one bats an eye. But sexual assault and rape is a taboo of the highest severity, the damn Voldemort of evil. It shall not be acknowledged,can never be spoken of or shown, because it might offend someone. Showing murder, dismemberment, and gratuitous violence is totally fine; nobody has any personal tragedies that might be evoked by its imagery. But showing rape will set the Internet on fire. Give me a break.\\n\\n\r\nI believe Shadiversity said something that perfectly sums up the show: \"Goblin Slayer makes monsters monstrous again.\" I think it's fantastic that Goblin Slayer didn't hold back with its scenes of gore, and graphic violence and rape. I'm glad it makes the viewer uncomfortable, asking in disbelief \"Did that really just happen?\" Yes it did. These are GOBLINS, not some neutered PC ripoff of them. These are vile, despicable, hedonistic, evil creatures. That's what makes them compelling and gives them depth. That's why you cheer wholeheartedly as Goblin Slayer proves his namesake, even in the most unsavory of situations. Especially in the most unsavory situations.\\n\\n\r\nAlright enough about that controversy. Let me address some other points briefly.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\r\nAuthor does a fantastic job with subverting traditional tropes associated with the adventure genre. In this world with dragons and demons and a mutlitude of other eldritch horrors... Goblin Slayer slays goblins. He's a very predictable fellow, but his ingenuity and expertise in approaching goblin slaying really makes each conflict engaging and draws you further into the story.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nPretty standard-good art. As you probably know, Goblin Slayer himself is drawn with CGI, which can be a bit abrasive in contrast with the rest of the cast. Still does a much better job of utilizing CGI than say Overlord or Berzerk.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nPhenomenal sound design. This show really proved to me something I had always taken to be true but never really appreciated: that sound design can make or break the show. Numerous times throughout the series I got goosebumps just from the anticipation I felt when I heard the battle music kick in or the anxiety/dread from the 'brace for tragedy' tracks.\\n\r\nAbove all I really can't express how beautiful the OP is. If nothing else, watch the Goblin Slayer OP. As soon as I saw it, I immediately knew it was in the top 5 best OPs of all time. It's so simple, yet elegant and powerful at the same time. Above all, Rightfully, the song in the OP just checks all my boxes, and hearing it instantaneously alters my mood. you'll just have to listen to it yourself.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nMost of the cast is pretty archetypical. The way in which Goblin Slayer interacts slightly differently with each, and the possibilities they provide for growth and bonding really adds a new dimension of interest to the show. One of the most commonly cited and my favorite relationship is that between Goblin Slayer and High Elf Archer. Their personalities and motivations for becoming adventurers are near opposites. As they spend more time together and they come to understand each other more deeply, they subtly start to swap traits and mannerisms. This is exceedingly apparent by Goblin Slayer's proclamation in the last episode, which I'll leave you to connect once you finish watching.\\n\r\nI also want to mention how much I love the character of Goblin Slayer himself. He really feels like a broken, apathetic man, yet you can sense his good-natured and kind core beneath. Other MCs generally always act the simlarly; they are animated, conscientious, reciprocate feelings, try to impress others, show great depth of emotions (flustered, confident, inspired, depressed). Goblin Slayer just has one mode, one range of emotions: Gobling Slaying. It's refreshing to see how easily and unintentionally he deflates every situation, and how he begins to change under the influence of Priestess and High elf Archer.\\n\\n\r\nOverall/Enjoyment\\n\r\nI don't think this show is quite a 10, but for it's undeserved controversy, ingenious soundtrack, numerous refreshing elements, and DnD theme, I'll give it the benefit of the doubt.\\n\\n\r\nWatch it. And if you aren't sold, at least watch the brilliant OP.",

            "content": "Story\r\n\tGoblin Slayer revolves around a male adventure named\u2014I don\u2019t even know who\u2014which is called as Goblin Slayer. Goblin Slayer lives up to his name, he slays Goblins and only Goblins. The story reveals around him in a journey to slay more goblins. Goblin Slayer is a super-dedicated person when it\u2019s about Goblin. Starting from his past to asking an obvious elf whether she is a goblin, going to far city just because goblin-slaying quest, and refuse to kill other than goblins. But, after someone spoke the \u201cgoblin word\u201d he\u2019ll instantly ask detailed information regarding to them. At this point his dedication should received a GuinessWorld Record.\\n\r\n\tIn his way slaying Goblin, people starting to revolves around him. Such as one that you thought would be the main heroine, a Priestess, a party consists of Elf, Dwarf, and Lizardman, a Guild staff and a childhood friend. The name of Goblin Slayer is actually pretty famous around the country, heck that\u2019s the reason for some plot event to be happened.\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\n\tGoblin Slayer is a ground-up character driven story. Heck, all of the goblin encounter happened because Goblin Slayer himself wanted to, and some people just follows him. If those people is just another shitty written character, I would be done with the series in like episode 3, but damn I\u2019ve met the most interesting character line up of 2018. By saying this of course I mean the party composition, but actually, even the additional \u201charem\u201d characters are pretty good.\\n\r\n\tGoblin Slayer\u2019s character is probably pretty clear from last section, so ill keep it like that and leave it to your own opinion after watching it. So first off is the Priestess. She is the one that mostly thought--- I as well\u2014as the main heroine of the story. She did has many important moments in making Goblin Slayer a better person, she is the morale keeper of him. But, iit didn\u2019t feel organic enough for me. I guess she is just being stubborn by doing what Goblin Slayer asked her to, which is to do what she likes\\n\r\n\tNext up, the party. The elf has tsundere archetype, and is somewhat and idealist about what adventure is. She is a the most straight-forward character in the party which acts both as someone who constantly shout and someone who\u2019ll kick our protagonist. The dwarf is an oldman who loves drinking and I belive as a master magicion of the party, like what kind of magic user that could harden concrete in 3 second? Meme aside, this gives us a glimpse of how much magic that he can use. Last member, the cheese-lover lizardman. His role as summoner and frontliner makes him probably the closest to Goblin Slayer. That, and probably he wanted cheese like all the time.\\n\r\n\tLike what I\u2019ve said, the additional \u201charem\u201d characters are actually pretty good.(The Guild staff is a straight onee-san type from any of your romcom anime. Her reasoning of liking Goblin Slayer is somewhat questionable, like really, but seeing interactions between them makes me go hngg sometimes.Lastly, the childhood friend. I believe to some extent that she is actually the end girl, due to how her presence for Goblin Slayer is at an inevitable level. She has the most relevancy to big plot point in anime too.\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\r\n\tThe animation is done by White Fox,  which in case you don\u2019t know also do the animation of Re:Zero and Steins Gate. I know that Goblin Slayer\u2019s animation isn\u2019t near their level, but I believe it to be because of the tone of Goblin Slayer itself. If we patched out the annoying CGI parts, I\u2019d say the animation is pretty good, sometimes it can be soft-slice-of-life, while sometimes being more edgy while slaying those goblins. Oh, besides the CGI, I kinda annoyed with the lips detail on the girl. I just don\u2019t know why it\u2019s needed to be.\\n\r\nSoundtrack\\n\r\n\tFor a D&D theme anime while trying to be kinda edgy, I feel the soundtrack itself as bit off. I\u2019m not an expert on this, but except the sakuga moments where Goblin Slayer\u2019s eyes turn red, I guess it could be better. The OP, Rightfully by Mili is a tone-setting OP, as what I\u2019d like to say. It has just enough edge on the animation, giving a sad-dark tone on the music itself, and set your expectation to the show. The ED on the other hand, Gin no kisei by Soraru is a much more honest song which kinda told us the story of our protagonist.\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\n\tI belive Goblin Slayer tends to hit rather an \u201cunusual\u201d D&D fantasy theme, rather than \u201cedgy\u201d D&D fantasy theme. Due to its dark setting we can see some basic human-sense, which pretty much about how to become human, rape is just a part of it.\\n\r\n\tI didn\u2019t mention much of the action of Goblin Slayer not because it\u2019s bad, but it\u2019s just there. Pretty much decent, while the sakuga moment is indeed very good, and also because I feel it\u2019s not the heart of Goblin Slayer. Maybe someday Goblin Slayer will slays all the goblin, or maybe someday he\u2019ll retired from his job, but the his journey of collecting again some basic human senses will always be there. As what a popular quote said, \u201cIt\u2019s not about the solution, but it\u2019s about the journey reaching it.\u201d\\n\r\n\tSadly though, that main idea is kinda blurred due to the edginess, or the rape scene. I did enjoyed Gobln Slayer, but I cant give it a higher rating than B. I somehow overlooked the flaws this show have and continue enjoying the journey of it. But, I believe that there are good amount of people that will just drop this show in episode 1, or even before the episode is finished. Those are some things ive taken into account when I give my final rating.\\n",

            "content": "This anime is a masterclass in minimalistic storytelling.  The plot is as simple as it can possibly be: \"A man slays goblins.\".  That's LITERALLY it.  There are no plot twists, no complex and multi-layered tales, nothing thought provoking at all.  Just a man who was traumatized as a child who grew up obsessed with killing the goblins who destroyed his village.  And it's not even told in a kind of \"revenge tale\" way.  There's no \"end point\" or main enemy to kill that will satisfy the Goblin Slayer.  He will do this forever because of his trauma andthere's nothing glorious or grandiose about it.  If anything, Goblin Slayer is looked at as nothing more than a pest exterminator.  No one respects his obsession with goblins and the anime doesn't even try to make it fanciful, like he'll ultimately become an elite superhero.  He's just a guy who kills goblins and openly rejects any greater ambitions than that.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd even though that's all this anime is, it turns out to be fantastic.  It's creative in its own way, forging a completely unique perspective on the fantasy genre.  Instead of doing the usual crescendo of \"nobody adventurer who rises up to fight the demon lord and save the world\", it chooses to focus on the dirty, grunt work of low level adventuring in a gritty and brutal way. (And yes, this anime is gory and brutal, and includes lots of rape and victimization of women.)  \\n\\n\r\nThat's probably the most interesting thing about this anime, is how goblins are portrayed.  Normally, goblins are just throwaway monsters that MC's don't deal with after the first couple of episodes.  A 60 second fight, before they go on to face dragons or fallen demons or something.  This anime focuses on the reality of what a goblin would actually be like in real life.  It's a monster, too.  It kills, it kidnaps, it rapes, it's evil all on its own and in a horde, they can destroy whole towns.  Goblins actually would be terrifying in real life and this anime really depicted that.  It's a stark contrast in comparison to how the goblins of animes like TenSura are depicted.      \\n\\n\r\nBeyond this, the fights with the goblins themselves were often very well done.  The Goblin Slayer got no respect from his peers, and yet, he was extremely skilled after years of fighting with goblins.  The battles reflected that as he used various strategies to defeat them.  But, he didn't just run over them in every fight.  He put his life on the line, as did his comrades.  You never feel like it's a guarantee they'll come out of the battle alive.  That made for very tense battles that added to the anime's suspense.  \\n\\n\r\nIn such a simple anime, that focused on the realism of what a goblin threat would actually look like in a fantasy world, there wasn't much emphasis on the cast or character development.  That would probably be the weak point of Goblin Slayer, but it doesn't really detract too much from the anime, because you realize when watching it, it's just a story about a man who fights goblins.  So, the MC was very stoic, and his crew tended to be one dimensional.  You've seen the fantasy tropes: The boisterous dwarf and the haughty elf who can't get along.  The healer priestess who worries about the health of the MC.  Nothing different here, other than the cheese loving lizardman.  But, that was pretty much the extent of his character: He loved cheese.  Everything was very simple.  But, it all just worked to create an entertaining anime.  \\n\\n\r\nHaving watched so many fantasy animes, this was a refreshing take on the genre that doesn't make you think too much or try to do too much.  It's something you just sit back and enjoy.  It was very good to be so simple and it succeeded in one of the hardest things for animes to do these days: It finished well.  The last episodes of the anime are the best episodes of the anime.  That's seems to be a rare feat these days.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n",

            "content": "There are two problems with this anime. The first problem is the main character. He eats his soup or drinks his wine while his helmet still on him. I think the company tried to create a character as weird as possible who only thinks about Goblins and that's all. They probably said their colleagues \"Draw something guys it's not important that much\"  so we can love the main character cause he's weird.\r\nMay contain SPOILER. The second problem is the story. All the people around the city keep saying Goblins are weak, nobody cares about them even the rookies. And people talk about dragons, DemonLords etc. but our main story is about Goblins. It's nonsense. The main character trying to take his revenge on Goblins but you don't feel anything cause you don't think they are strong or they can do anything. There are some scenes about the girls captured by goblins for us to hate Goblins but irrelevant ecchi scenes prevent our feelings again. And it's their only solution. For example, you see Tsurugi no Otome who encountered the Demon Lord and she was captured by goblins before. The same story.\\n\\n\r\nNote: Majo's voice acting is the worst voice acting I've ever heard before.",

            "content": "Review will focus purely on the story aspect since there isn\u2019t much to be said about the other aspects. Aside from some things involving goblins this is a minimal-spoiler review.\r\nThe Goblin Slayer anime is based off a light novel series. There is a manga adaption which had already covered the story arcs covered in the anime prior to the anime\u2019s completion. Viewers of the anime will likely notice a bar at the top of the screen warning about the show containing disturbing images. Is this bar warranted? There is no denying that Goblin Slayer is a rather graphic series. Considering the typical fantasy anime usuallyput out nowadays, I suppose there's no harm in having the warning, especially since the series is R+. So now you might wonder, Goblin Slayer is a graphic series, but is it a good series? Yes. It\u2019s not amazing, but it is good, and accomplishes what it sets out to do.\\n\\n\r\nThe general story of Goblin Slayer is simple. The series follows an \u201cadventurer\u201d who is known in the adventurer\u2019s guild by the name Goblin Slayer. Big surprise, he specializes in killing goblins, monsters who take pleasure in killing humans. Women will sometimes be spared death but will instead live a life of being raped and giving birth to goblins due to all goblins being male, so there\u2019s no happy ending for people caught in a goblin attack. No surprise that this anime is graphic.\\n\\n\r\nThis series does serve a purpose in that it\u2019s an excellent example of dark fantasy. Fantasy series are usually epic adventures of heroes slaying monster after monster until finally defeating the ultimate evil. Goblin Slayer purposely focuses on the less grand, yet still dangerous, adventures that would occur in such fantasy worlds. As is emphasized throughout the series, while goblins are a smaller-scale evil, whether the hero defeats the demon lord matters not to the villagers being killed in a goblin attack. Without those willing to do the less glorious work there would be no one to celebrate the work of heroes.\\n\\n\r\nThe series being graphic isn\u2019t simply for shock value, it\u2019s to show the reality of the world featured in the series. And the reality for the people in the world of Goblin Slayer is a dark reality. Should you watch this show? Maybe. If seeing intense gore or monsters raping women will leave you too disturbed to continue watching, then you shouldn\u2019t start the show, cause nearly every episode has gore and several have scenes that show or suggest rape. This show is not meant to necessarily be enjoyed in the same manner as most other series. But if you\u2019re looking for a good dark fantasy, not the usual hero saves everyone, but what happens to those the hero can\u2019t save then this might be a show to watch if you haven\u2019t yet.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, a FYI for people already acquainted with the series through reading and wondering what's different... In the anime two arcs are flipped. Otherwise, if reading the manga adaption of the novels there aren't any differences worth noting.",

            "content": "WARNING: This is less a review and more of an overly long, absurdly self-indulgent analytical exercise from an overthinking idiot poking a hornet's nest long after said nest had finally settled down. There will be full spoilers, discussion of sexual assault and rape, and positive reference to feminist discourse. If any of those things are triggering for you, feel free to bow out now.\r\nHoo boy. So. The rational side of my brain just wants to put this show away now that I\u2019ve finished it and forget all about it. Controversy aside, the fact remains that Goblin Slayer just isn\u2019t that good of a show, andI feel it would be better consigned to the dustbin of internet history that given any serious thought. Anything else feels like tempting fate in the worst possible way. But sadly, my worse instincts have won out here. I have not been able to stop thinking about Goblin Slayer ever since I started binge-watching it near the end of the Fall 2018 season, and the conclusions I\u2019ve reached on how it ended up exploding into the big deal it was and the outlook it actually presents are... well, they warrant discussion. More discussion than a simple review could do justice to. So in what I hope won\u2019t become a trend anytime soon, I\u2019m instead going to analyze Goblin Slayer in a long-form essay, meaning that by the time I\u2019m done writing this post my wrists are going to beg me to end their suffering out of pity. At the very least, I\u2019ll feel better having gotten these thoughts off my chest. And hopefully, I\u2019ll end up having something worthwhile to say on the matter.\\n\\n\r\nSo, just to get the simpler review side out of the way, like I said, Goblin Slayer isn't very good. Once you get past the godawful first episode it mellows out a bit and better finds its voice as a slightly grittier dungeon crawl experience with a pack of moderately interesting characters. It suffers from a boring production- even excluding the poor CG shots of Gobslay-san\u2019s armor, the direction is flat and the animation pretty lifeless- but the writing does work in the quieter moments when we\u2019re allowed to settle into the unease of Goblin Slayer\u2019s unmoored place in the world, and there\u2019s even some poignancy in his tale of overcoming trauma and coming to terms with his corner of life in a vast and uncaring universe. I just wish those moments were frequent enough to overcome the overall blandness and the screeching stupidity of its louder, more obnoxious stabs at edginess. But there\u2019s something just underneath the surface of this show, something deeply uncomfortable that no amount of better polished production values or more frequent quieter moments could fix. And that brings me to the focus on this likely far-too-long \u201cessay\u201d: what I came to understand about the rape scene in the first episode that blew the internet\u2019s collective stack when it first aired.\\n\\n\r\nBecause what I\u2019ve realized is that the rape scene isn\u2019t actually the problem with this show. It\u2019s just a symptom of what\u2019s really gone wrong. So let\u2019s see if we can reverse-engineer from that scene to figure out how we got to that point in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nThe first question we need to ask was, why was this scene hated? Anime has had plenty of tasteless assault subplots, even in this same year (Magical Girl Site comes to mind), so what made this particular scene blow up the way it did? Why does it suck? Well, a lot of reasons; the characters aren\u2019t well established enough for us to care when shit goes south for them in the goblin den, it feels gratuitous and overblown thanks to the Epic Rape Orchestra backing it, and the framing is ickily voyeuristic (seriously, I have literally seen some of those shot compositions in actual rape hentai). But I think the real reason it ended up rubbing so many people the wrong way was that it was a rape scene where the victim didn\u2019t matter.\\n\\n\r\nConsider: the fighter who gets assaulted has maybe five lines of dialogue prior, none of which give us any real sense of who she is as a person, then she gets raped, and afterwards, she has barely thirty more seconds of screen time (and no more dialogue) before she\u2019s shuffled off the show for good to waste away in a convent for all time. It treats her as disposable, somebody who doesn\u2019t really matter. She\u2019s a prop, somebody to be broken and tossed aside once her purpose as a one-use tragedy-generator is spent. The scene is all about established how evil and monstrous the goblins are so we root for them to get smashed; the fighter barely even factors into that equation at all. It\u2019s a rape scene that\u2019s all about the rapists and doesn\u2019t seem to care at all about the person they victimize. It didn\u2019t care about the fighter\u2019s trauma, or how this event affected her, or what her reaction to it was at all. Her pain didn\u2019t matter. Which, you know, aside from just being generally gross, is also bad writing. If the point is to make us hate the goblins, why would you do so little to make us care about the people they hurt?\\n\\n\r\nAnd were this isolated to just that one scene, that would be the entire conversation. Just a shitty scene executed poorly. Curtain, case closed, move on. But something occurred to me as I kept watching the show: it wasn\u2019t just the fighter who the show didn\u2019t seem to want to address the trauma of. It was the priestess too. I mean, she also goes through hell in that first episode, seeing her new companions brutalized right in front of her eyes. And she ends the expedition understandably crushed and sobbing, completely unsure how to proceed from here. But the next time we see her in the next episode? It\u2019s a month later, and she\u2019s already gotten over it and is making cute anime girl exasperation noises about just how gosh darn silly Goblin Slayer is. Again: a character is put through hell and back, and the show shies away from confronting it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd likewise, all the other brutalized woman we come across in the goblin\u2019s lairs (and pinned to their shields during the big army battle in episode 11) barely ever say so much as a syllable before they\u2019re shuffled off to presumed, offscreen safety. At the very least, the elf has a moment in episode 9 after almost being raped where she\u2019s visibly shaking at the thought of confronting goblins again so soon, but that\u2019s pretty much it. For a show that sells itself on taking place in a world where bad things happen to people, Goblin Slayer doesn\u2019t seem to want to explore how these bad things affect the people they hurt.\\n\\n\r\nWith one big exception: Goblin Slayer himself. Like I mentioned earlier, the story of his trauma and how he copes with it lies at the center of the show\u2019s narrative, and it\u2019s easily the best part. There\u2019s a warmth and understanding to his pain that doesn\u2019t sugarcoat what he\u2019s been through while still showing how he\u2019s learned to live with it and continues to figure out how to process it. His sister gets raped and killed in flashback without so much as a how do you do, but Gobslay-san is constantly allowed the opportunity to explore his pathology and how the events of his past affect him.\\n\\n\r\nSo it\u2019s clear the show does want to explore the trauma that living in this dangerous world can inflict. But why only him? Why do none of the girls- the people who, it should be noted, are by far at the most risk of being brutalized by goblins in the first place and thus would realistically have the most intense, visceral reactions of the horrors they perpetuate- have the chance to explore their trauma in the same way? It feels like an obvious storytelling decision, right? Why only tell a rape story about the victim\u2019s friend and not the victims themselves? So that begs the question: if the show doesn\u2019t want us to think about these girls in terms of how they interact with the darkness of this world, then how DOES it want us to think about them?\\n\\n\r\nWell, I do have an answer for that. And unfortunately, it\u2019s not a good one. Because thinking about the way all the show\u2019s female characters are introduced, a very noticeable pattern emerges. The Cow Girl\u2019s first appearance on screen is a big fanservice panning shot of her naked back followed by a massive boob jiggle. The slow-talking witch character likewise spends the vast majority of her introductory scene with the camera focused on her gargantuan tits and thighs. One of the first things that happens to the elf on screen is the dwarf mocking her for being flat-chested while the camera focused on said chest, just in case there\u2019s anyone in the audience who needed to be reminded of this fetish that they might like. The first thing the priestess says is \u201cI\u2019m fifteen and therefore an adult, so it\u2019s totally okay to lewd me because I am adult. And fifteen. Did I mention I\u2019m fifteen?\u201d Okay, slight exaggeration on my part, but don\u2019t try to pretend that wasn\u2019t the not-so-hidden intent behind that particular bit of worldbuilding.\\n\\n\r\nIn other words, all of the girls are introduced in a way that primes you to think about them sexually. First impression leave lasting impacts, and the first impressions for pretty much every female character in the show influence you to think about their waifu qualities before anything else. And all of them, including the only one who isn\u2019t introduced tits-first (the guild lady), are implied at some point later on to be in love with self-insert protag Gobslay-san. So we have a situation where the person adjacent to rape is allowed to have a fleshed out arc about trauma and recovery, but the people who are actually at risk of being raped are instead made to be fanservice vehicles. Their trauma doesn\u2019t matter to the show; their tits do.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, there is one big sticking point to this analysis, one female character who\u2019s arc does, in fact, center around her trauma after being assaulted by goblins: the Sword Maiden. The scars they left on her, both literal and figurative, have yet to fade, and she admits to still feeling intense fear of what might happen if they find her again. So much so, in fact, that she helps raise goblins underneath her city just to make her people understand firsthand the fear she\u2019s suffering (I think? It wasn\u2019t explained that clearly in the show, so someone correct me if I\u2019m wrong), and- and this is the real important part- she implicitly wants Goblin Slayer to literally fuck the trauma out of her. And honestly, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a bad route to take in isolation. I can buy the emotional state of wanting someone you trust to overwrite a traumatic experience for you, and I even see the logic in having a professed goblin-hater be the person to purge the evil thing the goblins did to you. There\u2019s potential there for a pretty interesting take on the subject.\\n\\n\r\nBut in context and execution, a lot of things go wrong that end up putting the final nail in the coffin of just what philosophy is driving this show. There\u2019s the obvious problem of Sword Maiden also being a heavy fanservice character, her erect nipples literally pressing against her tunic. More substantially, though, is how her trauma is framed. We first learn about her being hurt by goblins in a fanservice-heavy bath scene with Priestess, in which her scars are juxtaposed against shiny naked moe flesh. And when she confirms what happened to her with Goblin Slayer following his \u201cresurrection\u201d, the camera again puts heavy focus on her breasts as she\u2019s describing the horrors done to her. Both times, the Sword Maiden\u2019s trauma is associated with eroticism. It associates her rape in the viewer\u2019s mind with how sexy she is. The text says \u201cthis is horrible\u201d; the camera says, \u201cyeah, but don\u2019t you want to fuck her anyway?\u201d Once again, looking at the girls sexually takes precedence over actually exploring their emotional states.\\n\\n\r\nAnd SPEAKING of that resurrection, sweet tap-dancing Christ is there a lot to unpack there. Gobslay-san wakes up basically naked in bed next to an equally naked fifteen-year-old girl (sorry, fifteen-year-old \u201cadult\u201d), who naturally gets a full fanservice panning shot of her nudity. They couldn\u2019t look more like a couple who just had sex if that was what actually happened. And this is how the world was written: sleeping in the same bed as a virgin saves you from near death, apparently. Really think about that for a second: Goblin Slayer just saved Priestess from getting sexually violated by goblins at the near cost of his life, and she repays him by symbolically giving up her sexuality to him in everything but technicality. That\u2019s... really kind of fucked, isn\u2019t it?\\n\\n\r\nAnd this is the same scene where Sword Maiden comes in to try and seduce him with the sexiness of her debilitating trauma. In other words, we find ourselves in a situation where sex is both the reward for saving a girl from rape and the cure for healing a girl from rape. No matter what happens to the girls in this world, the implied end result is that they will all happily sleep with the view self-insert protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nSo now, take a step back and consider where we find ourselves. Goblin Slayer takes place in a world where sexual trauma is a thing, but only for the guys who see rape happen. Where the girls who are actually at risk of rape or outright victims of it don\u2019t get the chance to have that trauma explored in the same way. Where they instead are set up to be objects for the audience to drool over much like goblins ourselves. Where pretty much every girl is implied to want sex with the valiant man coming to save them from being raped, either as reward or cure. This is the world the show presents. So what does that tell us? What was Goblin Slayer trying to accomplish with all this?\\n\\n\r\nWell, in short, what all this reveals is that Goblin Slayer is, quite simply, a power fantasy. In fact, it\u2019s one of the oldest power fantasies of global popular culture: the fantasy of the big strong man who protects women\u2019s purity for himself from the evil, inhuman monsters trying to steal it from its rightful owner.\\n\\n\r\nYes, in the end, the most remarkable thing about the uncomfortable rot at the core of this story is just how unremarkable it turned out to be. From classic monster movies in the US like King Kong and The Creature From the Black Lagoon to classic tales of captured damsels in need of rescue, the pungent well Goblin Slayer draws from is a well of familiar tropes across storytelling traditions that have since fallen out of favor in a less chauvinistic world. It\u2019s the reason the women\u2019s trauma doesn\u2019t seem to matter: because the only thing that matters is that us guys are there to save them and get rewarded for it. It\u2019s the reason we\u2019re pressed to look at them sexually instead and why they\u2019re implied to want sex themselves: because that\u2019s what we\u2019re protecting for our consumption. It\u2019s also why the goblins are irredeemably evil creatures who we can feel justified in seeing slaughtered without mercy: it gives us a perfect villain to defeat that makes us, no matter how pathetic and miserable we are in real life, seem heroic by comparison, and thus fully justified in helping ourselves to that sweet, sweet virgin purity. Because we\u2019re not the bad guys! We kill the bad guys! So we don\u2019t have to feel bad about wanting this as a reward! It\u2019s totally justified!\\n\\n\r\nI realize I\u2019m being remarkably crass and explicit, perhaps uncomfortably so. But I want to drive home just how skeevy this all is. Underlying every decision Goblin Slayer makes in regards to its portrayal of rape is the desire to prop up this fantasy. This fantasy where us straight guys can feel justified looking at girls sexually and wanting to fuck them even as they\u2019re being brutalized in the worst way possible, because hey, at least we\u2019re saving them, right? This is not a new discovery. Goblin Slayer is only the latest example of a storytelling template steeped in well-worn, toxic value systems that\u2019s been around for centuries now. I repeat: the rape scene is not the problem. It\u2019s only the most obvious example of the problem. And no amount surface-level fixes to the animation or plot structure could wash that stain away.\\n\\n\r\nThat, above all was why the rape scene ended up kicking up such a fuss. Because even if the audience couldn\u2019t put their finger on it, they could sense those deeply uncomfortable undertones- the lack of caring about the victims of assault, the sexual framing making us want to imagine fucking girls while they\u2019re being violated- that would only become more clear as the show progressed. It\u2019s also, unfortunately, why the show ended up being a beacon for so many assholes who picked up on the same subtext; I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a coincidence that Goblin Slayer\u2019s defenders seem to have an inordinate amount of actual goddamn Nazis mixed in with them. No, that doesn\u2019t mean everyone (or even most people) who likes Goblin Slayer is a Nazi or a bad person or anything like that. But when I see so many of this show\u2019s loudest defenders attacking its critics with rape threats, death threats and Holocaust memes, I think it\u2019s entirely fair to consider what the show might be doing to attract that kind of audience.\\n\\n\r\nArt does not exist in a vacuum. It is influence by and in turn influences the culture that consumes it. No one piece of art can change your beliefs, but trends over time can influence their audience. What art communicates matters. What art tells its audience, intentionally or not, is worth discussing. And if there\u2019s anything I want you to take away from this absurdly foolhardy exercise of mine (seriously, my wrists are quite close to dying right now), it\u2019s that these kinds of questions deserve to be discussed, even if you don\u2019t want to discuss them yourself. If you like Goblin Slayer, like Goblin Slayer; your taste in art does not reflect your moral character, and anyone who tries to make you feel shitty for liking what you like is an asshole. But don\u2019t be afraid of people like me who see these issues in Goblin Slayer and similar pieces of entertainment and want to talk about them (I\u2019m quite interested to see how the discourse around Shield Hero shakes out this coming season). We\u2019re not here to take your anime away from you: we just want to see it get better. And if nothing else, I hope you came away from my ramblings with a bit more insight into the many ways we can look at anime.",

            "content": "Goblin Slayer is an anime which took the anime community by storm this past Fall 2018 season. The anime is very controversial as many people love it and many others hate it. I would say it is not a very good anime, but it is very enjoyable.\r\nStory: 5/10\r\nThe story of Goblin Slayer could basically be summarised as there is a man known as Goblin Slayer, who slays goblins and later forms a party to slay even more goblins. Goblins in this show seem fairly stronger than portrayed normally as goblins overrun villages and rape their victims, with the latter one starting a lot of controversy(although almost nothing is shown in those scenes unlike ecchi anime). If the rape scenes were necessary or not is another question, but it did give the viewer a clear image of how cruel the goblins in this anime are. As mentioned goblins also overrun villages several times, which makes it pretty weird for many characters in the anime to see goblins as low level monsters, not deserving any thought. The anime has got a pretty episodic nature as most events last 1 or 2 episodes, with the different events always having to do with different quests of slaying goblins. Surprisingly this show is not an isekai anime, but just a fantasy anime, as nobody gets transported to another world. The premise of the show, although basic is fairly unique as I have not seen an anime purely focussing on slaying goblins. There is a lack of themes to this story though, as there seems to be a lack of things to be learned from this story. A recurring theme is the question to kill goblins who surrender and goblin children or not. This question is soon answered with killing those goblins as well, as they continue with their cruel acts anyway. This does not really teach the viewer anything either.\\n\\n\r\nArt and animation: 7/10\\n\r\nThe art and animation are fairly good, sometimes using some unique animation like with the opening and certain other scenes. The scenes where goblins are being fought are also animated pretty well. The character designs are also pretty unique and well done. A downside is that use of some (bad) CGI can really distract the viewer, like with Goblin Slayer's armor being animated with CGI often. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nThe music used in Goblin Slayer is also pretty good. The opening theme song is very unique with the way it uses its music, making for a pretty good opening theme song. Sound during fight scenes is also used very well, although there were not really any soundtracks standing out to me in the anime, with the exception of the opening theme song. Aside from that, the voice actors did a pretty good job voice acting the characters, although they were not very impressive either.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10\\n\r\nThe characters of Goblin Slayer are not very impressive. There's Goblin Slayer, who just likes to slay goblins and had some dramatic past having to do with goblins. There's the priestess who joins a beginner party and gets saved by Goblin Slayer after the rest of her party gets raped and killed. She also has a pretty bland character. Some of the characters interactions in the anime can be pretty enjoyable, but the characters are overall very one dimensional. There is also a lack of character development throughout the anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nAlthough this anime was not very good with its story and characters, the anime was very enjoyable for me. The fight scenes were pretty interesting to see, with many unique ways to slay goblins being showed and many different kinds of fights, in caves, on land or partially on boats being showed. Some of the character interactions were also pretty enjoyable to watch as some caused some pretty comedic moments. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10 (6,4/10)\\n\r\nGoblin Slayer is not a very complex anime. The story is simply about Goblin Slayer who slays goblins in a lot of different ways and the characters are pretty one dimensional, although offering a few enjoyable character interactions. The story also has some inconsistencies and a lack of things  to be learned from it. The show was very enjoyable for me though as it offered a lot of variety in the different fights against the goblins. As there seems to be a continuation in the making, we will wait and see if they improve the story and characters, as some of the backstories seem to be able to provide some interesting new content.\\n\\n",

            "content": "The character seems straightforward at first but has a deep train of thought that has him reasoning with himself as to why he needs to keep killing goblins so that he can deal with his issues and traumas and make the world a better because he believes that goblins are a big threat when they attack as a horde and force many horrors on innocents and thus is why he continues his rampage.\r\nThe anime has the MC that only feeds on the above source and has only ONE mission in his life. To. End. All. Goblins. Watching him at his best while dealing with hordesof goblins is what makes this anime so entertaining at its core and the character himself is pretty enjoyable to watch when he's at his best! The story is somewhat straightforward but the way its presented and moves forward is what makes it such a treat where the MC meets new people which some of them change the way he will ever look at life again. The visuals, the sound design are pretty entrancing when the fights are on and its heavy DnD based inspiration is what appeals to me the most! When newbie adventurers come into a dungeon unprepared and full of confidence they get wrecked in the most horrible way possible and its very intense to keep watching! BUT this won't happen when high ranked individuals as a group confront the same threat and while the MC himself is sort of a master at dealing with goblins he by no means is even close to being invincible or OP so he always uses his skills, his wits and his WILL to fight the goblins and try to bring an end to as many of them as possible. THIS, gentlemen is what makes Goblin Slayer my 2nd most best anime of the Fall 2018 season and my 5th best anime of the year!\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score is an 8/10 as it does nothing besides what it needs to do but its score is still limited in what it can do to further its horizons but alas an anime like this is what makes watching it such a freaking treat!",

Alongside with the names of the characters- well, as you already now they have no names and i think that is really cool. The story might be generic, simple, but if the execution is done right it can be something very good. We follow Goblin Slayer and his \"friends\". They kill goblins in every way possible. \r\nArt/Animation-8\r\nThere are certain scenes which are done very well. But the main thing that got me from not scoringan 10 is the CG. \\n\\n\r\nSound-10\\n\r\nI know that the soundtrack might be repetitive, but it is orgasmic. And when you have Goblin Slayer in his rage mode... it is on another level.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- 10\\n\r\nNow, the main part of this review. \\n\r\nGoblin Slayer- He's a dude who seeks vengance and wants all goblins in existence to die. The reason for this is that he suffered what many others have (not rape) but his siblings were raped, tortured and killed. Throughout the series he \"matues\" in a way that makes him more human, but he's also a killing machine. He is also a tactician who uses his brains against goblins and knows how to kill them efficiently.\\n\r\nThe other characters are developed good i might say. Especially The Priestess and HEA.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-10\\n\r\nIt was a blast tbh. I liked every bit of Goblin Slayer- and yes even the rape.\\n\r\nIt was what i needed to watch in a loong time. Gore, bloodshed, rape, torture, killing, screaming, pain, emotionless. \\n\\n\r\nOverall- 10\\n\r\nWith 1 episode Goblin Slayer got the attention of many many people so it became the most popular anime of the Fall season. \\n\r\nI give it a 10 because of Goblin Slayer alone and the badassery that he brings with him.",

The thing is though, once you stop thinking about the first episode, and how tasteless and blunt it is, there is not a lot to this show that is worth caring about or thinking off. \r\nThe first episode pissed me off, because the whole purpose of it is to trick you. The premise as it is portrayed to you, the artstyle, character designs, the tone, everything just exists so the twist toward the second half willfeel as dark and fucked up as possible. The fact that the show has so little patience for anything, developing characters, making us care about the guild system, making us like somebody from our party, the show doesn't care. A big warning sign for your \"dark fantasy\" is that the creators are just so eager to give you \"the goods\" that they don't care about anything else. The episodes that follow in Goblin Slayer is nowhere near as dark as the first one. But as a result, they're just bland and completely uninteresting. The show offers absolutely nothing but a completely hollow, non-character dragging around a bunch of other hollow non-characters killing the lamest possible monsters in fiction. \\n\\n\r\n There is nothing interesting about Goblin Slayer as a show. It has no themes, no ideas, no intellect behind it. It's production values are just kind middle of the road and it's not very fun to watch either. I mean if a show is completely vapid, it has to at least be fun and Goblin Slayer is nothing to write home about insofar as it's action sequences. Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress is dumb as a brick, but it's 1000 times better than Goblin Slayer by virtue of having some really jawdropping, metal sakuga, combined with steampunk nail guns and katanas. The creativity going into that show, as dumb as it is, is better than Goblin Slayer, easily. And it manages to sell grit and darkness without shoehoring edgy nonsense into the first episode. \\n",
