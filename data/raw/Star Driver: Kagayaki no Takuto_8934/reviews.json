            "content": "Adaptations are becoming a bit of a thorny issue in anime these days, which is a bit odd considering how many are produced every year. The constant conversion of stories from other media is a pretty lucrative business as there's already an established market for the end product and its merchandise, regardless of how good the show actually is. Like anything in life though, there's a price to pay, and there are increasing concerns about the impact adaptations are having on original works. The resulting negative effect on script and screen writers is beginning to be felt throughout the industry as studios everywhere are findingthat their creative teams are slowly becoming unable to develop original concepts into viable storylines. The reason for this is purely because in comparative terms, it takes more effort, imagination and skill to make something original than it does to rework something that already exists, and if one doesn't regularly exercise their \"mental muscles\" in a substantial manner, then their creativity will begin to stagnate.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's the reason why we get anime like Star Driver: Kagayaki no Takuto (Takuto of the Radiance).\\n\\n\r\nThe series begins with Agemaki Wako and Shindo Sugata as the pair take a moonlit stroll along a beach on the fictional Southern Cross Island. Along the way Wako detects the scent of of someone she doesn't know, and following the trail, she and Sugata find a young man who has been washed ashore. He is Tsunashi Takuto, and his arrival on the island will awaken his destiny.\\n\\n\r\nWell, that all sounds pretty heroic, but that's about as far as it goes. Star Driver may initially seem like an interesting proposition, but many of the plot themes are never fully realised, which only exacerbates the fact that there is simply too much going on in the storyline. The series makes some rather nice subtextual introductions at certain points, but no matter how important these may be to plot or character development, they're never fully utilised and thus become the equivalent of the human appendix (i.e. totally useless).\\n\\n\r\nThe storyline progression is handled in the standard \"fight of the week\" manner that is so prevalent in shounen anime and manga, but alongside that Enokido Yoji (series composition and script writer), and director Igarashi Takuya (Soul Eater, Ashita no Nadja, Doremi), have seen fit to add a number of themes that only serve to confuse the audience. In addition to this there are a number of questions that remain unanswered come the end of the series, which may hint at an attempt to have the viewer infer the relevant information rather than outright carelessness.\\n\\n\r\nThat doesn't mean the storyline is bad though. While there may be a degree of confusion, Star Driver does offer up some interesting ideas that could have taken the show in a new direction.\\n\\n\r\nVisually the series is a bit of an odd blend as while the concept is predominantly shounen, several of the male characters have a decidedly bishounen look to them. Star Driver seems to play on this by naming Takuto's alter ego the Galactic Pretty Boy, but it's difficult to tell if this is an attempt to parody the character style. That said, there's a mundanity to the overall design that no amount of beautification can remove, partly because everyone is supposed to look good, but mainly because there seems to be a limited range of expressions.\\n\\n\r\nWhile there are a few scenes that depict specific feelings rather well, the majority of the time the characters display very little emotion, and many of the more expressive moments can seem forced or contrived. In addition to this, the complicated and overly sexualised costumes of Glittering Star, the weird posturing, the rather odd mahou shoujo style transformation sequence when Takuto summons Tauburn, and even the design of Tauburn itself, all promote the idea that Star Driver is a parody anime, and this conflicts with the serious tone of the show.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Tauburn ...\\n\\n\r\nThe conceptualisation of the cybodies is interesting in that it highlights a degree of innovation and originality, which is odd when one considers the slightly banal approach to character design. There's a novelty to the mechas that's nice to see, especially Tauburn's rather obvious court dandy/musketeer influenced look, so the obvious question is why the same innovative approach wasn't taken with the characters themselves. The backgrounds also suffer from a similar mundanity, which is a little disconcerting given the nicely surreal overtones of Zero Time.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the animation, the character movements are pretty standard, but the action sequences are often fluid and well choreographed. Unfortunately this is overshadowed by the the fact that specific scenes have simply been re-used to the point where viewers may find themselves skipping particular moments, and while this tends to be a fairly common practice in \"fight of the week\" shows, it still smacks of laziness.\\n\\n\r\nWhich neatly leads me on to the audio side of the series.\\n\\n\r\nStar Driver initially seems to be well served in the acting department thanks to the experience of Miyano Mamoru (Takuto), Hayami Saori (Wako), Fukuyama Jun (Sugata), and the rest of the cast, so it's a bit strange that many of the roles seem shallow and forced. Part of the reason for this is the lack of facial response on the characters themselves as this gives the impression that the seiyuu are trying too hard, but the script is also to blame as much of the dialogue seems to have been written just to fill in the gaps. All of this makes the voice acting a much more difficult proposition as the seiyuu are often forced to compensate for poor writing.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand the effects are well timed and very clear, and one of the nice things about this show is how it doesn't use music, as background tracks are often reserved for occasions of emotive importance or action sequences. There are also two opening and ending themes for the series, and while they tend to have a slightly upbeat feel to them, they seem to work well with Star Driver's major theme.\\n\\n\r\nPossibly the biggest issue though, is the lack of substantial development on the part of the characters, which could have been somewhat offset had they been clearly defined from the start. Unfortunately this is not the case, and while viewers are given the facade of progression through interactions, conversations, and even action sequences, in reality there is only one thing learned throughout the whole show, and this only occurs in the final episode. In addition to this there are few explanations forthcoming about why the members of Glittering Star are so determined to use the cybodies, and the only thing that seems to tie their actions into the story is something called The Departure (which is another thing that isn't properly explained).\\n\\n\r\nBut that's not the worst part.\\n\\n\r\nIn a nutshell, the characters are dumb, and leading the idiocy is Takuto. The very first episode has him entering the enemy base, but for some reason he \"forgets\" that he's been to the heart of Glittering Star's operation, and so the secret society is left to continue their work relatively unimpeded. This is possibly the biggest hole in the plot as at that point Takuto is aware of the enemy, knows where they and who their target is, and could very easily expedite a much simpler and shorter resolution. Because of this the so-called past traumas, the posturing, the banality of the high school setting, pretty much everything used to define the characters in some manner, all become slightly ridiculous.\\n\\n\r\nSo, where does that leave us? Well, on the surface this seems like a pretty solid proposition, especially with Enokido Yoji (who wrote the screenplay for Diebuster), taking part on the production side, and there are some enjoyable moments that occur throughout the series. Star Driver is nothing if not an interesting idea that tries to approach certain concepts from a different angle, and the little touches of innovation here and there add a pleasing quirkiness to proceedings.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, it's not enough as the series retains a ridiculous quality that isn't helped by a decidedly sub-par script, seemingly emotionless characters, and the lack of any substantial explanations. Star Driver tries to do too much with too little, and the apparent attempts at parodying certain themes only adds to the confusion and makes the plot more convoluted and overly complicated.\\n\\n\r\nThis may not be an adaptation of any sort, but that doesn't mean that it's automatically good, regardless of who worked on it. There are some positives within the series, but ultimately this is nothing more than mediocrity at its finest.\\n\\n\r\nThe fault lies solely with Bones, who in the last two years have produced one original anime franchise (Tokyo Magnitude 8.0). Everything else has been an extension of an existing title, or an adaptation from another medium. Unfortunately they're just one studio out of many that continue to try and cash in on the popularity of something else, with no regard for the effect this has on the viewer or the industry itself. After all, it's easier to blame things like fansubs for falling sales rather than admit that what you've produced is nothing more than average.",

            "content": "Star Driver has been one hell of a polarizing anime since day 1. Some people were initially on board because it looked like a throw-back to old school mecha. Some watched it because it looked like a full on parody of 90's anime with the ridiculous nature of the show combined with the over-the-top style. And even more watched it because it was penned by the same guy who did the composition for Revolutionary Girl Utena, Yoji Enokido. Yet when the credits rolled at the end of episode 25, it was obvious to me and to anyone who stuck with the show that Star Driverwas its own beast so to speak. It incorporated elements of the things I mentioned above yet it never really followed through with any one idea. Surely a mish-mash of these ideas would create schizophrenic anime which tries to do everything and succeeds at nothing, correct? Any other circumstance, I'd tell all of you yes, because there's absolutely no way an anime like that could ever be good. Yet against all odds, I found myself enjoying Star Driver more and more as the weeks went along until I reached the startling conclusion that hey, Star Driver was good! Not just good but pretty damn awesome and compelling! I wrapped my brain around why I was enjoying it so much, when virtually every aspect of the show was working against it. I mean what kind of anime has the audacity to take itself seriously when the main character's title is \"Galactic Pretty Boy\"? The answer is: Star Driver, an anime that somehow manages to pull it all off, and pulls it off with a healthy dosage of fabulousity.\\n\\n\r\nSD's story isn't really something out of the ordinary. A secret organization made up of high schoolers are bent on taking over the world with giant robots that are sealed in a pocket of space/time while some random Mary Sue shows up to thwart them with his own ridiculous giant robot while sporting an equally ridiculous costume and Mahou Shoujo-esque transformation scene. While this is the basic premise of SD (and pretty much every episode), many people will think it gets repetitive pretty soon (and believe me, it does). So why would anyone like it? Well my answer is derived solely from one aspect of the show and that's primarily the subtlety of the execution. The subtle way exposition is fed to the audience, the subtle way characters are presented and written, it makes for a really compelling style. Its one of aspects that made Utena as good and popular as it was. Now I know BONES' anime have a notorious reputation of not holding the audience's hand at all when it comes to story-telling and much of it becomes read in-between the lines or not addressed at all. Star Driver also does this, but only to a degree. It's not so vague that it becomes frustrating but its mysterious enough to compel the audience to continue watching. It gives the audience a chance to think about the plot and characters by themselves and tactfully delivers the answers later at an appropriate time. This is a grand form of storytelling not because the story itself is good but mainly because of the way its presented. Unfortunately while the storytelling borders on masterful, there are some really annoying pacing problems with the whole package. Case in point, most people will drop this in the first 5 or so episodes. I wouldn't blame them because the show has very weak start, where characters are very slowly introduced and the show pretty much relies on the mecha fights to carry it for 20 minutes. Didn't help that the fights were usually only 1-2 minutes long. It slowly builds itself up and it really gets better after episode 7 but I can't really look favorably at the beginning since it could have played up the shows strength which is characterization instead of lolhijinks and boring-as-hell mecha fights. The show also drags towards the end which is honestly baffling to me since there was plenty of material they could have used to make things interesting. Yup, around the end it sort of reverts back to the formula used at the beginning, but thankfully gets its shit together and ends on a strong note. \\n\\n\r\nNow like I said earlier, SD's characters are its strongest point. Even when nothing but high school antics are happening on the screen, there is a sense that everything that happens has some meaning behind it. So when characters often start talking about inane or seemingly pointless topics, it can turn out to be euphemism or a metaphor that has relevance to the plot. Now I don't mean all the antics and comedy have some ulterior theme to them, sometimes there really are comedy scenes to make the audience laugh but more often then not, you'll be thinking about some lines of dialogue long after they've been said. This brings me to another element that SD does really well and that's character interactions. Instead of long flashbacks about something or other, character's personalities are revealed through the way they act around each other, especially when the tone becomes serious. And these are probably the best parts of the show, Sugata's conflict with Takuto, Mizuno general interactions with her sister, Kanoko's demeanor and attitude towards the Glittering Crux and Wako's internal struggle between Takuto and Sugata are all great. Even more impressive is the fact that SD goes out of it's way to characterize minor characters as well as major characters. You can probably argue that Takuto himself is the Mary Sue and isn't characterized worth shit but at the same time you could probably write papers on how his real personality is implied in juxtaposition of the Mary Sue front he shows to all the characters and even the audience. Hell you could even write an essay on how his first phase ability makes him the main character of the show with his catch-phrase \"Dazzling the stage\" as proof of how meta things can appear.  It doesn't go as far as Utena does but it certainly isn't a slouch slouch in that regard. \\n\\n\r\nAs per all BONES anime, the art and animation is done very well. There are loads of awesome sakuga cuts for all the animation fans out there. Generally the fights can be very repetitive with Takuto winning all the time but the animation can make them very exciting sometimes. It doesn't happen too often since I can count the number of times where everything aligns on one hand but when the art, animation, plot and music are all synched in excellence, it becomes very awesome.  But be warned, this isn't really an anime where the mecha fights are the most important part of the show, most of the backlash towards the beginning happened because the mecha bits were actually the worst parts. Mostly because the fights are nothing more than a tool for characterization in the end and you're enjoyment of it will revolve around how much you care for the character that fights Takuto. I won't say the mecha aspect is downright terrible, but I honestly think they could have better implemented the Cybody fights to coincide more with the plot than the characters. Some of the best episodes in the show don't even have any fights in them. The sound on the other hand is really good and is strong throughout the show. SD has some of the best insert songs I've heard in quite a while (like Monochrome) and uses them very efficiently. The other tracks manage to keep up with the vocal ones as well, so its not like the rest of the OST is bleh in comparison. The voice work is also typically good, the best performances come from Jun Fukuyama as Sugata, Ayano Niina as Kanako and Akira Ishida as Head. Can't say I'm not sick of Mamoru Miyano after watching a lot of animu but he pulls off Takuto's happy-go-lucky attitude well enough and still manages to convey his more serious moments with the appropriate tension.  \\n\\n\r\nStar Driver really turned out to be that one show you liked but couldn't really point out why. Kudos to all those people who stuck with it through thick and thin, god knows it tried our patience many times. But for all its apparent shortcomings like derp pacing, flaky mecha moments and wasted potential, it still manged to be one hell of an anime, and a great ride. I'll definitely miss the Saturdays where I stayed up all night into the wee hours of Sunday morning discussing the newest episode and whatnot. If you haven't watched it, I recommend really pushing through those first couple episodes because they're not the best this anime has to offer. Star Driver offers a really unique experience that I haven't seen in much-if any anime, so I strongly recommend it.\\n\\n\r\noh and\\n\\n\r\n(\uff89\u309d\u2200\uff65)~\u30ad\u30e9\u2606 KIRABOSHI!\\n\\n\r\nbecause it had to be done.",

            "content": "You know how, like when you were a kid, you'd ask for a bedtime story that wasn't from the book? For me, that's what Star Driver is. It's one of those stories that's just... different. Maybe there are animes that could be similar, but this one just stands out. \r\nIf you think about it, the story is simple. The Galactic Pretty Boy has to defeat the Glittering Crux Brigade, in order to... well, we're looking for 'save the world', I guess? Other than the names, it sounds pretty generic, but I gave it a perfect 10. Not because of some sort of game-breaking plot devicethat ultimately makes the plot 10 times cooler, but it's simply how they pull it off. Even if some parts are cliche, it's still pretty original.\\n\\n\r\nNow, art. I just have to say, Tauburn is the pimping-est looking mecha in the history of ever. All the mechas (or Cybodys) have very vivid and special qualities, making them different to each other. All with very good color schemes, and unique designs. The characters are pretty well done. Sort of like Code Geass, where they go for the tall skinny characters. But unlike Code Geass, characters are younger, and for me, are a bit more proportioned. I give it a 10.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting, opening theme song, ending theme song, background music, sound effects... Oh, and a special song that plays whenever they fight.... It suits the anime perfectly. There's really not much to say here. No complaints whatsoever. 10.\\n\\n\r\nWell, since I don't want to name names and spoil anything, I shall just refer to them by the color of their hair. Red is the lively and upbeat type of person. Believes in good, yadda yadda, all that jazz. Common in a main character, so no complaints there. Yellow is the normal-ish clueless one, and Blue is the quiet and mysterious ones. Alright, the mains are a bit generic, but as I said earlier, it's how they pull them off. The supporting cast are a colorful (Both hair-color-wise and personality-wise) set really able to help tell the story of Star Driver. Plus, the development with all of them, God, it's just freaking good... (Yes, I can be creepy)\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I really like the anime. I enjoy every episode, and I think a lot more people should watch it. There are currently nine episodes right now, and each one is good. It's an unusual mecha anime, of which the likes I haven't seen in awhile, and of which I hope to see more of soon. \\n\\n\r\nHave fun.",

            "content": "I've never seen an anime get so many high ratings for reviews, while I think it's pretty crappy. I saw this anime in the January 2011 copy of the Japanese Newtype, and thought it seemed interesting enough so I decided to watch it. I liked how the characters looked, and it seemed vaguely interesting, but my high hopes were soon shot down.  I don't know if I am missing the pure genius of this anime, or if I just see past all the jiggling boobs and girls who want to tap everything, and see the series for the pile of nonsense it is.SPOILERS, KINDA SORTA, DOWN THERE VVVV. \\n\\n\r\nThe series had a good start, but after seeing a scene where maids randomly had cat ears and 4 foot bunny ears on, I grew worried of the fate of this series in my eyes. Yada yada, school stuff, yada yada. \"DON'T GO TO THE OLD GOLD MINE KIDS\" -cut scene to gold mine with girl in her discount sexy time outfit- . Why they decided to buy out a circus and Mardi Gras surplus store, and make the girls dress like they are at a S&M club is beyond me. I just can't really take characters seriously if they are looking like a jester reject while wearing a cheesy gold mask with a beak. Just the whole lair in the gold mine thing just baffles me, everything about it. It just seems so stupid to me. Every time they'd have one of their evil group meetings, I'd be forced to wait through 4 minutes of all the girls re-crossing their legs 40 times, and shots of their legs and garters. God forbid we see their faces. There also sometimes would be random cheering or booing from what I will assume are 100 fat old hairy men lurking in the shadows, since They never really show any of the other members. \\n\\n\r\nIn the first 2 episodes, they decided to reuse several scenes like 5 times, and made jokes about 4 times of how wacko, oh i mean Wako is always hungry. There is also really awkward staring scenes between our hero GALACTIC PRETTY BOY and Wako, and throughout the next 4 episodes they try to show that the two are crushing on each other (uh, hello, you already made that clear in the first episode). I thought the mecha stuff was pretty cool, but in the course of 2 episodes having the same type of fights, and the same ending was kind of over kill I think. I'M GOING TO WIN, GRRRRR. -gets destroyed after a few seconds- OH NOO, -stumbles out- FIRST THINGS FIRST, WE ARE TAKING YOUR LITTLE BADGE THING, GET OUT OF HERE AND GO WORK OUT IN YOUR DARK ROOM, YOU AREN'T IN OUR CLUB ANYMORE. Also, what was the point of kidnapping Wako in the first place, if she magically appears in her little bubble thing whenever a fight is going to occur while she is doing random things. Let's just pray that she isn't taking a dump one day, and she is force bubbled into a fight scene. At only 4 episodes in, they don't really explain what all this maiden and mecha stuff is very much. Why do these things even exist? How do only certain people have the power to control them, and why do they have to use those ugly masks? \\n\\n\r\nOh, and apparently every time someone is about to fight, the random fish girl in the cage has to start singing. After 3 or 4 times of this, I had enough. I have no idea who this fish girl is, or why she is in a cage or anything. All she does is just play with a chain, and tell really boring stories to some guy that uses way too much hair gel and just rolls around on some couch. \\n\\n\r\nMe being a girl, and not a lesbian, the naked scenes, boob jiggling, random make out scenes, and panty shots didn't really win me over. Apparently to be in the villain club and a girl, you need to show everyone you are horny, and either make out with people, try to rape them, or be about to kiss them. Apparently the thing to do is to kiss through glass. A moment that made me \"wut\" was when the stacked green hair girl starts regaling the class (while the teacher is talking) about how she is married to some 65 year old and how she gets \"lonely\" at night. Who does this. No on in real life for sure. She also decides to get a hair cut (it doesn't look different) in the middle of the classroom during lunch time. \\n\\n\r\nWhy she lives on a cruise boat and has a alligator in some dirty pool, I have no idea. LOL DON'T WORRY GUIS HE IS A FRIENDLY ALLIGATOR! \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this series had the basis for something really cool, but IN MY OPINION fan service and just trying too hard made this series pretty sucky. I really liked the opening though, so props for that. Too bad I don't like the series. It was pretty bland, and could be a lot more interesting. It was also really confusing at times, and I felt as if parts were cut out or that there was a really sudden scene change. The characters had personality, but some of them showed none or only stood out because of there hair color. Maybe this series gets better in the later episodes, but I think I'll pass on this series. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

Also, I felt the need to write this based on finding the previous review pretty inarticulate, and slightly off-base, however, people are entitled to their own opinions.\r\nStory: \r\nYes, the previous review was somewhat right, in that there is a lot thrown at you, but it really isn't that hard to keep up with. Also, it's to be expected that the first episode gives the audience a lot in order to pull in a big audience. It also makes me a lot more intrigued than turned off. It is a little overthe top, calling the main character's newfound power \"Galactic Pretty Boy,\" but it was enjoyable, nonetheless, and honestly, there's worse out there.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nArt is great, and so is the action. They insert a mecha fight scene into the 30 min segment that they are given, and it comes in a little randomly, there are many questions that pop up for the audience, but it was done very well.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI loved it. The background music was better than a lot of series I've watched. Opening and closing scenes were nice (and the animation to accompany them was great.)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThis is a little shaky because there was so much introduced in one episode that it makes the characters seem very underdeveloped and random. However, keeping in mind that this is the first episode, and I am very curious as to how it all pans out. I like the characters so far at least.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nREMEMBER - THIS IS A REVIEW BASED ON THE FIRST EPISODE ONLY. \\n\r\nAnyways, I would definitely give this series a try. The opening song with the animation really sparked my curiosity because it revealed a little more about what is to come. The only thing I would really look out for in the upcoming episodes is character development, and obviously plot development (leaving too many questions for the audience, making too many random actions, etc).",

            "content": "Remember when you used to watch Sailor Moon/Pokemon back in the days and you were so dedicated to the show, not missing an episode, even though each episode was so predictable and had so many repeated sequences that it's almost laughable?  But you loved every minute of it and couldn't stop watching!\r\nWell, Star Driver reminds me of those shows.  Each episode contains the same confrontations, the same transformation sequences, the same fight sequences and same slap-stick comedy between the main trio.  But there's just something about the show that just hooks me to it.  Maybe it's the fact that it movesbeyond shows like Sailor Moon and delivers a decent plot, crisp art, great soundtrack, and extremely likable characters (with pretty costumes to boot!)\\n\\n\r\nTakuto, the show's hero, ends up half drowned on a remote island.  There, he meets Wako, a happy-go-lucky shrine maiden and Sugata, the cool quiet guy.  He ends up going to their school which turns out to be a lair for these giant mecha robots called 'cybodies'.  Turns out most of the school can pilot these things and what do you know, Takuto can pilot one too.  Complete with his own transformation sequence (because guys need them too!), he turns into Ginga Bishounen (Galactic Pretty Boy) to protect Wako from the 'bad' cybodies.\\n\\n\r\nLike I said, story from episode to episode is pretty much the same thing, only with different characters.  But the little side stories and funny moments they add really boosts the enjoyment factor (like Wako's BL fantasies). The beginning episodes give you little snippets and hints for the main plot, then it really starts delving into it starting in episode 20.\\n\\n\r\nArt is superb, it's been the only show where I've actually noticed characters eye movements and blinking.  They definitely did a great job with the details and didn't cheap out with the panels. Even the repeated transformation sequences are quite tolerable with the great graphics ;)  Might I add I love their costume designs too!\\n\\n\r\nThe cast is amazing too, Fukuyama Jun (ie. Lelouch, Grell) plays Sugata,  Miyano Mamoru (ie. Light, Zero) plays Takuto. OP/ENDINGS are catchy and I do like the random songs the characters sing from time to time.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters have taken on almost stereotypical standard character types from anime.  Takuto is the bright, optimistic guy, Sugata is the cool, level headed pretty boy.  Wako is your damsel in distress but still very likable.  While not entirely original, it's been tried and true.  The antagonists are well introduced, each with their background story and specific quirks, they actually don't really feel like bad guys.  It's really easy to get attached to the characters.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, my enjoyment rating is higher than all the other ratings (I gave it a 9), which doesn't really add up.  But I have to say that I am really addicted to this anime at the moment.  I definitely recommend for others to try, maybe more so for the girls since I feel there's some male fanservice going on in here (if the transformation sequence is any indication) =P  All in all, a fun enjoyable watch!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Overall: star driver is a very colorful and action oriented mecha anime which stars a red haired bishonen Takuto.\r\nStory: What can I say, it has been done before, better.  An organization on the island, Glittering Crux wants to unlock the power of the cybodies (the mechs) and use them for....Something.  The cybodies can only be used in zero time, some alternate dimension, and Crux wants to break the powers of the 4 maidens on the island to be able to use cybodies in real space.  This all sounds well in good, its just the execution of the whole concept is pretty subparfor an anime being released in 2010.\\n\\n\r\n-> Note: the reason for the low story marks is because the charecters dick around in school or the island and it is no were near as funny or fulfilling as other mecha anime, namely any Gundam show, or its much closer cousin full metal panic.  If you have not seen full mental panic and are reading this, go see it.  Its infinitely better than Star Driver.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The visuals are fantastic.  The cybodies are colorful and seem as powerful as they are made to seem within zero space.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound is good, but what really stands out is the music.  Particularly the music when members of crux being to enter there cybodies.  Also in the earlier episodes the fish girl songs combined with the regular music score create a 5th element type sythisius of sound and music that is simply perfect.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: the characters are well portrayed, but they are fairly bland when all is said and done.  There is not that much development side from the initial portrayal.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: despite its serious drawbacks with the plot for a modern mecha anime, star driver is a fun, flashy show that should keep you entertained for 20 mintues.\\n\\n",

            "content": "*This review contains spoilers.\r\n\"Grand Entrance! Galactic Pretty Boy! Tauburn!!!\" Such a stupid and embarrassing line that I would never repeat in public in a million years, but there's something about this series that's just so captivating and moving.\r\n'STAR DRIVER: Kagayaki no Takuto (Takuto of the Radiance)' is like a homage to various '70s mecha anime. Everything about this series screams of classic Japanese mecha, superhero, and tokusatsu, while many modern elements, for better or worse, are also incorporated. The surprise is: Everything clicks.\r\nThe story of 'STAR DRIVER' is summarized by caged girl in the beginning and later in the school play: \"Planet of Fish\". Theevil organization \"Kiraboshi\" aims to reach the stars by breaking all 4 seals of Zero Time and activate cybodies in real life. Kiraboshi's leader is akin to Sam in the \"Planet of Fish\" story. On the other hand, Takuto tries to destroy all cybodies so that Mako, the Southern Seal, can leave the island. He represents Mark from the school play. Episodes take the monster-of-the-week format \u00e0 la '70s mecha.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the archetype heroes and villains from classic mecha. Our protagonist Takuto is like one of those classic superhero who's good at everything, likes to help everyone, and has such a strong sense of justice that he's almost naive. Yes, super robots were never meant to be piloted by weak indecisive morons, they were supposed to be piloted by superheroes that kids admire. The hero proactively engaging into the battle to make the world a better place, is a nice change from most recent mecha series. On the other hand, the antagonists are all in an apparently evil organization shrouded by mystery. This character setup is proven to work over and over in iconic classic mecha series.\\n\\n\r\nScene recycling is prevalent like the retro shows, with cybercasket scene looking like classic mecha sortie, Tauburn appearance scenes recycled with CG-assisted backgrounds, hero 'Sailor Moon' transformation into uniform. The enemy mecha even explode with delay, 'Kamen Rider' style, having the protagonist's mecha looking all cool in the foreground after pulling off some awesome move.\\n\\n\r\nAlmost every single mecha moves are borrowed from famous '70s anime. Yes, the pilots even scream out the signature move names! These are just few that I noticed (and still remember):\\n\r\n* Tauburn: \"Tau Galaxy Beam\" - Mazinger Z \"Breast Fire\"\\n\r\n* Tauburn: \"Tau Missile\" - Getter1 \"Shining Spark\"\\n\r\n* Tauburn: \"Galactic Cross Cut\" - Daltanious \"Flame Sword Cross Cut\", Voltes V \"V Letter Cut\"?\\n\r\n* Tauburn: \"Pile\" Attacks - Nu-Gundam \"Fin Funnel\" Attacks\\n\r\n* Tauburn: \"Pile Crusher\" - Getter2 \"Drill Punch\"\\n\r\n* Tetrioht: Bike attack - Combattler V \"Gran Dasher\"?\\n\r\n* Qophlite: Flight mode - Transformers?\\n\\n\r\nThe retro influence can even be found in music for this show. Did the insert songs leading up to, and during battles remind anyone else of 'Mothra'? The two main insert songs were absolutely brilliant. Catchy and well edited, more importantly, godly audio mixing that matched perfectly with every single episode's battle initiation.\\n\\n\r\n\"STAR DRIVER\" must seem like an outdated '70s knockoff by now, but there are also many modern elements mixed in.\\n\\n\r\nStory-wise, the pacing is excellent. It was so captivating that I didn't mind the excessive corniness, and just wanted to know what will happen next. It seems like battle in alternate space is a fad this season, with 'Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica' and 'Yumekui Merry' following the same format. Our heroes are taken to \"Zero Time\" by Kiraboshi in nearly every episode, where they fight like crazy for the fate of the Earth, unbeknownst to rest of the world. The show ends with a generic modern epic final battle where the protagonist transcends an (supposedly) insurmountable power in the universe. We've seen it in other mecha series like 'Gurren Lagann', 'Asura Cryin', 'Heroic Age' etc. Unlike those mecha series with fail endings, 'STAR DRIVER' never got too serious, and maintained the so-bad-it's-actually-good atmosphere throughout by almost making fun of itself by rolling out one retro clich\u00e9 after another, thus the corny ending actually worked.\\n\\n\r\nThe show also had healthy amounts of harem and ecchi. It's true every girl in the show were head-over-heels for Takuto or Sugata. However, both of those two main characters knew exactly who they liked, and also didn't have to act like a thickheaded retards most of the time, and just brushed off girls they're not interested in. Additionally, those guys are supposedly extremely good looking, and have decent personality or mystique, so it wasn't too far-fetched that they were the most popular guys on the island (yes, living in an island give girls limited choice too). The ecchi was present in Kiraboshi female costumes and cybercasket scenes, but the girls didn't trip randomly for panchira and the camera wasn't constantly shooting up to their panties. Although these elements exist as little bonuses, they were never detrimental to the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe modern artwork is magnificent. Mecha, character, and costume designs were very unique, and the battle scenes were very exciting with fluid action. The visuals were so nice that the horrible CG-assisted recycled scenes seemed to be deliberately done for '70s influence, so-bad-it's-actually good. While the scenery in Zero Time was always amazing, the ordinary world was a bit too bland.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is wonderful, especially for that of Takuto, Kanako, and Keito. All of were perfect fit for respective characters, and very emotional tones in key scenes. BGM were decent, some of them quite memorable. The OP by Aqua Timez was perfect for the theme, and addictive like most of their tie-ups.\\n\\n\r\n'STAR DRIVER' was a highly nostalgic mecha series for me, which successfully blended the tried-and-true retro qualities with clich\u00e9 modern elements to create something completely different. Admittedly, there is the gayness of Galactic Pretty Boy and Kiraboshi members, the abundant corniness, and certain plot holes (like why don't they just shoot Takuto in real life?) that the viewer must overcome, but I believe series like this is what anime is all about. This is one of those series where you have to stop thinking and just feel the show. Is there still a child in you?",

            "content": "Star Driver is a perfect example of a show that takes a simple formula and makes the resulting show wayyyy more complicated than it needs to be. The formula that I am talking about (monster of the week) is common in kids shows. Yes, kids shows! You know those shows that you loved when you were 10 but you 'grew out of?' Well, I WOULD describe this show as sort of a teenagers version of a 'Monster of the week', except this show probably takes on the themes of at least 2 other shows through the time that I was watching it. For a 26episode anime, this is simply too much to do in a 25 minute show in my opinion, especially since a third of the episode is taken up by a fight scene (every episode, hence Monster of the week).\\n\\n\r\nAnother issue with this show is the characters. I could find ONE character that I liked. The rest of the characters could all just disappear and I honestly would not give a shit. I'll try to describe the characters despite this. We have the three main characters - Takuto, well I could not find anything special about his character but apparently he can summon a robot under certain conditions and uses dual swords. Then we have Sugata and Wako, who are trapped on the island that this anime is set in for various reasons. Sugata and Wako are also engaged(not really important to the main story). I don't feel like describing the rest of the characters because\\n\r\n1. Too many characters. Way too many. \\n\r\n2. The characters are all forgettable, partly because of 1. Except for Mizuno. Maybe it's because I actually sympathized with here and she didn't suck as much as the other characters did, including Takuto and co.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation in this show was bright, colourful, fluid, all that jazz. However I do have an issue with the character designs. The characters all look like stick figures. It doesn't help this show's case that the main character looks more like a pussy than the smallest guy in my school. Also, I think they colour coded the character hair so that we could actually identify the characters from each other because they were so uninteresting otherwise.\\n\\n\r\nMusic/sound in the show was nothing to complain about really. The only problem with this section is that it is never explained why the girl in the cage is singing the song before the main characters jump to that other dimension (Zero Time). To me this seems like the show is giving the song meaning for no reason at all.\\n\\n\r\nI don't know what else to say about this show. The concept of it sounded pretty cool at before I began to watch it but the series ended up being really boring because of a bunch of themes scattered all over the place and really uninteresting characters. I don't think I even got the character names right because of how uninteresting they are. Most of the characters contribute almost nothing to the story and are just there to fill time while the  main villain just goes about his business. I don't think I will ever finish watching this show because I highly doubt the ending will save it for me. I don't really have an issue with 'monster of the week shows', but the parts between the fighting were really boring and pointless. I think I would have just preferred an endless series of fights. \\n\\n\r\nTo summarize, I would not recommend this show unless you really enjoy huge fighting mecha anime. You won't be thrilled at the characters/story so it would be best to just tolerate them while waiting for the inevitable clash between two huge robots. Otherwise, there are plenty of shows with cool characters that you can relate to and don't make watching a freaking show seem so much like a chore.\\n\\n\r\nI hope this review is helpful. \\n\\n\r\nThis is my first review so feel free to message me and give me advice on how I can improve my future reviews. \\n\\n",

I my self is victim to this why become Star Driver yes has mechs, has sexy babes but that's where everything ends. Its not bad its just the flow of the story and character interaction has not been very\"Interactive\". Yes I have watch 6 episode of the series and will watch it to the end because it will be unfair to judge it this early. \\n\\n\r\nGood Point\\n\r\n1. Story good enough its not your typical new guy in school meets people then meets friends fight bad guys save girl then that's it. So far The main character has to fight against his entire school (I mean it every one in his school) to protect the girl. Yes its not very original but come on the entire school population is against him and wants to kick is ass. \\n\\n\r\nBad Points\\n\r\n1. Bad flow yes its to early but in 6 episodes and still the same thing. Fight other students in mask (some are hot female students by the way ^_~) and every time he defeats one they just go by there way no revenge or friendship growth with the main character nor do they interact with the main character.\\n\\n\r\nThis series reminds me so much of magical girls like sailor moon etc. but for the male version. Its not bad but the lack of flow early in the story is about to poor. I know its still the build up stage but six episode just fighting like magical girls with mech's is pathetic - yet original + so being balance is your chose when you watch this.\\n\\n\r\nJust finished it so kept my promise...\\n\r\nLast thing is you watch it your self and judge it. So that's that hope that this helps you guys.",

            "content": "This series was giving me a number of vibes connected to Code Geass and I don't mean that in a good way. Star Driver appeared to be trying to mix around the classic archetypes of super robot anime, slice-of-life high school comedy and the over-the-top elements of Code Geass. If the series ran for the most part as a comedy like Gurren Lagann where it didn't take itself seriously, then I would have found myself liking this series quite well. Instead the series tries to take itself seriously yet with the many eccentric traits of the characters, it comes across as rather awkward and hardto take seriously just like Code Geass and is bogged down by quite a good number of issues in its plotting. Many episodes tend to run in a similar setup:\\n\\n\r\n1. Takuto is enjoying himself with Wako and Sugata.\\n\r\n2. Random member of Glittering Crux in the student body meets with him or tries causing mischief.\\n\r\n3. Member decides to challenge Takuto to Cybody battle.\\n\r\n4. Takuto overcomes foe.\\n\r\n5. Repeat for much of the show's run. \\n\\n\r\nThis was quite a repetitious setup for each episode and made things appear to be mostly episodic for the show. In addition, the show doesn't really bother going into great detail into its major elements such as what led to each of the students in Glittering Crux to join the group, how Cybodies came to be, how humanity came to discover them and why the Glittering Crux did not dispose of Takuto away from Cybody battles if they desired world domination so badly. The ending also came across as rather weak with a shallow baddie unveiling himself, elements of deus ex machina and failing to provide a proper resolution to the love triangle that later develops with Takuto, Wako and Sugata.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some elements to the plotting of Star Driver that did work well for me and kept me from dumping it much earlier on. The series does do well at fleshing out and developing the bond between Wako, Takuto and Sugata showing that the three come to greatly care for one another, even as they are aware of the complicated situation they have to overcome with the Glittering Crux and their love triangle. Marino's character arc even lays out some heart-wrenching and deep-seated issues with her that are not as apparent with her on the surface.\\n\\n\r\nOn the visual end, Star Driver does have clean artwork delivering a decent amount of detail on mecha, character and scenery designs; as well as having its moments of fluid animation during fights between Cybodies. There are some noticeable occasions where the visual quality can drop quite a bit, particularly in some scenes during the middle and last episodes.\\n\\n\r\nIf you could put up with and enjoy the bizarre and over-the-top developments of Code Geass, then you might be able to enjoy Star Driver more than I did. Otherwise, be prepared for a mostly mediocre romp that tries to blend together the elements I mentioned above yet comes across as hard to care for because it doesn't cover its major elements and is hard to take seriously when it tries to be so.",

            "content": "Sometimes, you get a work that \u201cdoesn't know what it wants to be\u201d \u2013 shows with a confused tone and jumbled presentation that tried to reach for too many different elements and couldn't grasp them all.  Star Driver is different.  In a weird way, it's a show that knows exactly what it wants to be... but somehow manages to be ignorant of what it is, leading to it rather shamefully squandering loads of potential.\r\nSo what did Star Driver want to be?  It wanted to be a teen drama/romance mecha fighting show with a 'surprising' emotional heart to it \u2013 a spectacle ofaction and young love with a zest for life.  The problem is that most of these core elements are... kind of poorly handled.\\n\\n\r\nLet's talk about the action.  This is Star Driver's biggest, and probably most insulting problem.  The animation for the action scenes (and the show in general) is gorgeous.  It's bright, it's colorful, it's fast, it's flowing... every moment is easy to 'read' and carries a lot of meaning and impact when it wants to.  The issue is that the fight choreography is terrible.  Most of the mecha battles in the show have very few twists and turns, not a lot of action from either side, and are actually terribly short when you cut out all the long (if pretty) repeated or nearly repeated intro and outro animations.  In fact, I'd say that for the first two thirds of the show, the average mecha battle has maybe thirty seconds of actual robots fighting.  This would be bad on its own, but it's especially grating when the show spends several times as much time on the setup and wind down as it does on the actual meat of the action scenes.  Repeated animation (especially when there is some variation) isn't bad on its own, but when it outweighs by far anything you do with said animation, you've got problems.  I'd contrast this with a show like Kill la Kill, which clearly didn't have enough money to have constant, detailed, good-looking animation like Star Driver, but more than made up for it with excellent choreography and a good sense of what makes a fight scene engaging.\\n\\n\r\nBecause it isn't (just) how cool the fighters look.  Star Driver has that down, but it fails on other elements.  For instance, there needs to be an ebb and flow of combat.  The best fight scenes, whether they're quick or long, do their best to have each side gain and lose the upper hand multiple times, or at least for good reasons why the tides turn.  You want to see the heroes on the ropes and rally, and to believe in the threat of the villain you also want to see them rally and counter what the hero does now and then.  In Star Driver, most fights start with the villian showing off, and then Takuto turns it around and wins in one hit before you can really appreciate the recovery, and there's never, at least until the final episodes that get this a little better, a fight where the villain can present a continuing threat and the hero's victory doesn't feel trivial or automatic.\\n\\n\r\nFurther, good fight scenes establish investment in what the fight is about.  You can have two characters beating each other up, but viewers won't be invested unless they understand why these characters are beating each other up.  Star Driver, for all that it actually gives a lot of focus to its villain of the week (too much, if you ask me) fails to establish the stakes that are why Takuto fights against the Kiraboshi Order of the Cross.  OK, they were trying to... um... hurt a girl?  Nullifying Wako's seal would seem to be something that would sting, and it's a pretty jerk thing to do, but beyond that?  What they'd actually like to do with the cybodies once they're unleashed?  It's marvelously unclear; we know that they would have power sufficient to be players on a global stage, but we don't know why they want that power as a group or what they intend to do with it.  And, in fact, individual members of the Kiraboshi Order of Silly Costumes seem to have different opinions: One wants to make money,  another wants outsiders off her darn island, another seems to want some kind of justice... they have too many individual goals to really mesh as a group.  This means, as a weird conspiracy, they're too unfocused for us to really feel threatened by them: they could use those cybodies to burn nations and rule the world with an iron fist or they could use them to make shoes for orphans; the show doesn't really care.  They're kind of jerks to Wako, and while that may be all the motivation Takuto needs, it's not all the motivation we need to be with him when he's putting his life on the line for it.\\n\\n\r\nFrom all of this, we get the main weakness of the show: it spends way too much time and effort in singular areas, and fails to support them properly.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast is another example of this.  The main characters are, oddly enough, some of the least interesting characters in the show.  Takuto, Sugata, and Wako are (in that order) Bland, Blander, and Blandest.  I can kind of forgive Takuto for this \u2013 being the male lead is never easy, and at least he has something of a personality but Sugata and Wako have the defining features of slightly broody cardboard and damp cardboard.  The best thing I can really say about them is that the show does at least seem to know that they're deprived of characterization, and doesn't try to insultingly tell us facts that aren't shown.  They have nothing, but that could and would be worse than nothing, and at least they're consistent in how blandly vaguely nice or so they are.\\n\\n\r\nThe weird thing is that the side characters are actually rounded and developed.  Minor villains that are relevant for one or two episodes over the entire course of the show have hopes, dreams, and backstories that give them more personality and deeper characters than our leads pretend to have, while more significant side characters like Mizuno or Kate can do even more, and their struggles have the capacity to carry entire arcs that our leads couldn't support.\\n\\n\r\nAnd as with the raw beauty of the animation, you might ask yourself: \u201cIsn't that a good thing?\u201d.  But the problem is that it comes at the expense of things that are more important.  The show, as a whole, could have been stronger if we spent less time with all the nobodies and also-rans in the Kiraboshi Order of Unclear Goals, and more time establishing our main characters as people, or building up some relevance to the battle over the cybodies.  Maybe a couple of the villains could get full supporting character development, but only ones that could actually tie in, rather than distracting from what's actually important here.\\n\\n\r\nI say this especially because, once the show actually gets around to giving answers and doing things that aren't just developing Kiraboshi Order of Angst mooks or giving us the 90% same fight every episode... it actually has good answers and good elements.  The final arc's involvement with Sugata is a great turn of events, but it's squandered because he says probably half a dozen words after the turn.  The villain's master plan is great, and in a better work with a better explored villain it could have been something amazing... but we only learn about it in the literally final episode, mere minutes before he's defeated for good.  Other arcs, involving the Shrine Maidens and even the heroes would have had more of an impact if the show as a whole had been paced better, introducing topics, letting them sit with us, and developing them over the passage of time so they have some natural growth, rather than just throwing them at us and resolving them about as suddenly.  The entire structure of Star Driver is like drive-by storytelling: Plots, and not ones that benefit from the element of surprise, appear out of nowhere, hit you, and then disappear as suddenly.  On the whole, the last act of the show is, again, a bit better about this than the show as a whole, but by the time you get there the damage has already been done.\\n\\n\r\nSCORE BREAKDOWN\\n\r\nStory: 4 (the pacing is wrong and it doesn't know what to focus on)\\n\r\nArt: 7 (It's very pretty, but poorly used)\\n\r\nSound: 8 (This is strong; the Voice Acting is spot on and Monochrome is a beautiful song)\\n\r\nCharacter: 5 (There are good characters, but they're the wrong characters)\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\r\nTOTAL: 5.8 (6)\\n\\n\r\nVerdict: Some shows are vastly more than the sum of their parts, using elegant structures and moments of brilliance to spin straw into gold and make something amazing or impressive out of bits and pieces that wouldn't be that good on their own.  Star Driver is the opposite: it takes a bunch of good pieces and proves, that with bad pieces placed in exactly the wrong places, all those good elements can fail to add up to anything worthwhile.  It's not the worst show I've seen, not by a long shot.  It isn't even particularly bad.  But all the same, it's enough of a waste that I really couldn't and wouldn't recommend it.",

Futhermore, the story is more about a bunch of teen-agers with Cybodies and powers to manipulate the so called \"Zero time\" who do what every adrenaline filled teen-agers does, and that is DUKING OUT WITH EACH OTHER.\\n\\n\r\nArt-Rating, a dreadful number 2.\\n\\n\r\nWhat gives?\\n\r\nCo'z  the way the characters school uniforms, Glittering Crux Brigade members attire to the Cybodies are gay, gay and gay. Let's start with the school uniform especially the tie, it looks like an inverted penis, for the girls the tie looks like an inverted penis with balls in the sides of thier collars, 2nd the Glittering Crux Brigade's attire, nearly all of the girls dresses in an S & M outfit while the guys dress in a heavy metal band. Also the Cybodies look like a poster symbol for Anorexia, which somehow how makes me think that the artist of this anime seems to be promoting it. I also hate both artist and author's concept of making the members of  Glittering Crux Brigade to wear funny looking masks that looks good when in a royal french party. \\n\\n\r\nSound- Rating, a very good 8.\\n\\n\r\nNo comment here.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- Rating, a very good 8.\\n\\n\r\nI really like the roles that Takuto Tsunashi, Wako Agemaki and Sugata Shind\u014d  play. However, it is a bit confusing as to who is the main villan of this anime. It may be possible that Sugata Shindo could be Takuto's enemy. So, I guess will find out in the end of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall- a fair number 6. \\n\\n\\n\r\nTrivia: The story of \"Robinson Crusoe\" was inspired by a real life castaway Alexander Selkirk who was strandred in an island a few miles off of Chile for 4 years.",

            "content": "Star Driver, as an anime, is quite a formula. However, it does its formula extremely well, meshing together a deep story, outstanding characters, haunting music, and beautiful art to create an anime that should not be missed this season.\r\nStory: I find the story to be deeper then you might get from the start. While it is very heavy handed with dropping important plot related issues without explaining them (hence the 8), the story ends up being much more then a loose way to generate episodes. Sure, each episode is a formula, starting with a slice of life in the start transitioning into a flashy mechabattle in the end, but what it does inside the context of the formula is spectacular. There is so much hidden within the context and between the lines that it will appreciate long into the future, as an anime you watch first for the action, and again to get the best understanding of it.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Star Driver does not disappoint. Each cybody (mecha) is unique, colorful, and well animated, in colorful tie-die environments. Each character is unique in style and poise, unique enough that you can spot most anyone from a distance (just by hair color!). The wide shots give the sense of beauty that you would want from an island. A nice fusion of hand drawn and computer drawn that gets a small bit noticeable (only if you look really closely) but ads a nice dynamic to the look of the fight scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The Intro/Outro music is well and good, but the true beauty comes from the songs sung (yes, sung) during the show. Each of the three melodies (possibly four) that we know of so far are hauntingly simple, ear worm style pieces that will stick in your mind long after you're done watching an episode. It's quite a change, and an enjoyable one. In terms of sound effects, everything is spot on, and well done, so there isn't much else to say about it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Every character has their due on Star Driver. Characters that you thought gone due to the Monster of the Day formula come back to influence the plot yet again. Each person has a darker side to them, each has their dirty secrets, and all are interconnected to each other in ways that transcend the anime it's self. That being said, it does take a little while for this ball to get rolling, and however fantastic the characters might be, having them start out simple isn't the best impression.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This show will make you smile, laugh, gasp, and want to watch more. This show is a show you tell your friends about, you get them to watch it, and you laugh about how seriously absurd it is. This is one of those shows that will be watched over and over again, a fantastic reference point for future mecha anime shows. This is a show that doesn't lose themselves in politics, in emotion, in statements about human emotion. This is a show that is fun. It is fun enough that you can watch and enjoy it, but deep enough to analyze to your heart's content.\\n\\n\r\nSummary:\\n\\n\r\nWatch this thing. Watch it once. Then again. Love it for its simplicity and action. Dive into it for its deeper statements. Anyone who thought shows like Neon Genesis and Code Geass could sometimes get too deep into themselves and just wants to see great fight scenes will be at home. Those who liked those shows for their complexity and subtle brilliance will love the story and the hidden connections, implications, and just general mind-screw that the show will give you.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: Good, you skipped to this. Watch + Download this now.",

Sadly, it went down to a \"which boy will Wako choose?\" and \"Takuto beats down the Kiraboshi\" without very much development.\r\nArt:\r\nI don\u00b4t have much to complain here. It was a bit too colorful in my opinion, but especially in the fighing scenes, you could see were all the graphic-work went. \r\nSound:\r\nThe soundtrack was maybe one of the most outstanding features of the anime; the tracks themselves felt good,and the insert songs were a great addition. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nHere it stars going downhill.\\n\r\nMost characters hardly change from your first impression. From my point of view, exept the love-triangle centering Wako, there is almost no character development at all. Most of the female characters even fell in love with Takuto or Sugata to a certain extent, at the very least they didn\u00b4t see them as enemies anymore.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nTakuto comes. Takuto fights. Takuto saves the day.\\n\r\nThat\u00b4s basicly what every episode was about.\\n\\n\r\nWith the sole exeption of Head, most of the Kiraboshi-members somehow didn\u00b4t take their goal serious, beeing all nice to Takuto or even becoming his friends outside of the fights. Until shortly before the end, no one got at least once the idea to fight him with more than one Cybody. It seems that defeating/killing him outside of a Cybody was never an option either as well, since nobody tried even once.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the story, you hardly feel like anything important happened since episode 2, because there is hardly any new plot-related information at all (ignoring a bunch of other love-relationships).\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI really liked Star Driver when it started, then it became a single sided \"Takuto ownez them with some new/old technique or help from Sugata\" - business with a featured \"girl in love\" theme.

            "content": "Star Driver is a confusing story of a bunch of kids trying to take over the world. Well, in essence. This show literally can take anything and throw it at you. Sometimes this works, and sometimes\u2026 well it doesn\u2019t. The less critical you are of every little detail the more and more enjoyable it can be.\r\nThe story takes place on a small island with a big secret. There exist giant robots that are sealed away by the maidens of the island. The Glittering Crux desires to release these upon the world. As the seals are broken they come closer and closer to being released intothe real world. However, it is up to the Takuto to dazzle the stage and prevent them from breaking free from the dimension they inhabit! Again and again he fights them off like a true hero! While this is all fine and good and he is quite dazzling\u2026 the combat becomes quite repetitive. Sure each Cybody, robot, is unique and has its own gimmick but the fights all feel the same. There is no feeling of urgency as you see Takuto kick ass without any scratches every time. Thankfully if you brave it out the final battles are more unique, interesting, and well, closer to the quality of something that those people can say is \u201cBONES quality action.\u201d That said if I had to grade solely on the episodic action segment it would be pretty bad. However, the stuff taking place outside of Zero Time, the dimension cybodies are sealed in, is a lot more enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Star Driver cover every archetype out there. We have the rich ojou who lives on a huge boat and has two servants one of the few I have ever liked, the studious serious mysterious class representative, and a free spirited girl who believes in magic. As a matter of fact, the female lead is one of the least interesting and unique one that comes to mind. She is, however, the maiden which Takuto and Sugata fight to protect. Takuto is very admirable, kind, and the way he enters the battle saying \"Dazzling the stage, galactic pretty boy\" pretty much sums up how he does everything. Sugata is very serious and always looking out for Wako. He is also very quiet and doesn't like to be upfront about what he does.  Each and every one of the characters have something about them that will leave an impression on you at one point. If there is one thing Star Driver does right, it is weaving in episodes for each character. Unfortunately I will not elaborate on the characters more because the bulk of what is interesting about the show is finding out who they are.\\n\\n\r\nYes, through the first chunk of episodes they introduce all the characters of the story. Depending on if you like said character the episode can be a hit or miss. The \u2018good guys\u2019 consisting of the mains interact through these supporting roles in order to show us each side of the story. By each side I imply that these others are always somehow involved with the cybodies on the island. They don\u2019t go to great lengths to hide their identities, at least to the viewers. The Glittering Crux only wear masks, and when you\u2019re the only person with that hair color AND that seiyuu it is sort of hard to not make the connection. \\n\\n\r\nThe romance in this ends up sucking for something original and not ongoing. There is not much progress in this although Wako spends all of her time uselessly fawning over our male leads. There are a few good moments but in sort, do not hope for much here.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the interesting things is the parallelism they make between the story of the characters and the that of which is told behind the scenes by Sakana of \"Sam the Squid Piercer.\" It tries to put an artistic or descriptive background on what I was watching and was just one of the many little things that I found interesting. Another little repetitive quirk: The animation scene is the same every time zero time is activated and people board their cybody. The sequence takes a good minute at least, and the same (awesome imo) insert is played for it, switching once half way through. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThere is one thing that can't really be described - Star Driver somehow gets you pumped up. The battles aren't stunning, the story takes a while to kick in, but there is just something that makes you want to say 'this is pretty awesome!' every time you click the play button. So as a disclaimer; If you don't get pumped up at all in the first episode it definitely won't happen at all. If you lose this after episode one feeling by sticking it out a bit longer till episode 6 or 9 for two good arcs. From there it only gets better.\\n",

            "content": "There was just something about this anime, I don't know what it was, which just kept drawing me in. I would have moments where I was hesitant to continue watching episodes, maybe looking at all the episodes I still have yet to watch and thinking about how they were going to fill them all, but, when I finally did decide to continue, there was just something that hooked me and made me fall in love with this anime all over again.\r\nThis anime reminds me of Gundam Seed, except with less action and more character development. This anime has a pretty big cast of characters andwhile some didn't get the exploration I think they deserved (come on! George and Tetsuya are the hottest guys in the anime and they're barely in it! I feel ripped off! I need my eye candy! D:), this show just seems to have a way of making you fall in love with characters you never thought you would fall in love with and, in the end, I think that's something about the show that is simply amazing, it makes you love its characters so much.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of people felt that the lore was really esoteric, but I followed it all pretty easily and it's certainly not any more out there than a lot of other animes I've watched. When it's at its worst, this anime is a simple, plain Mecha anime with a mystic twist, not bad, just a little plain, but, when it decides to get its act together, oh, can it ever be good! There are twists which I was amazed at and moments that tugged at my heartstrings. Mizuno, who I really didn't like at first as she seemed annoying and childish, has such an amazing arc that had me amazed when the big twist finally came and, in the end like every other character, I came to love her so much! This anime definitely gets better as it goes, building off of what the earlier episodes work hard to set down and make the audience comfortable with, until it becomes great. This is also an anime that, even though it's protagonist is male, is arguably a female-driven anime with the majority of characters being female and having the most time dedicated to them and their character developments. Overall, it's definitely not an anime for everyone and I think it may be better for some people to watch the movie instead as it works to streamline the story, but, overall, I definitely don't regret watching this anime. It's not good enough for me to consider watching it again, but it's definitely one I'm glad to have watched and to have in my completed collection.\\n\\n\r\nStill, the extra content in the movie is so amazing, especially if you've watched the whole anime. If anything, those few extra minutes gives this anime a huge boost.\\n\\n\r\nThis is an anime that I find very hard to grade, there are things I adored, but also things that hold me back so, overall, I have to give it 7.5 cybodies out of 10, maybe a bare 8 with the extra movie content attached one.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the adventures of life continue on.... :)",

            "content": "In a boring world, there are youngsters who seek thrills while having their spirit be their guide. And what could be better than swimming to an Island infested with a evil organization destined to destroy the world, in order to find the fabulous school-life while being a \"GINGA BISHOUNEN\"? Welcome to the world of Star Driver: Takuto of Radiance, a glorious anime filled with thrills and school drama. But let's not forget the giant robots that fight for their goals, which will prevail, Good or Evil? Ladies and Gentlemen, let's not waste more time and jump right in!\r\nI will put my review into these categories;Overview, Story, Characters, Sound and Animation, and my overall enjoyment which serves as a conclusion!\\n\\n\r\nThe overview:\\n\\n\r\nThe Story takes place on a Island somewhere in Japan, location unknown, where we follow in the footsteps of our prettyboy and real main character Tsunashi Takuto, in his search for his father and nothing more than the thrill of being young and adventours. What seemed to be a regular Island contains a dark past, where an organization known as The Glittering Crux has evil plans to break an ancient seal, in order to bring the sealed Mechs called Cybodies into the realm of living. The seal is contained within four maidens of the Island chosen by bloodline in order to defend the seal and prevent it from breaking. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the Glittering Crux is successful in breaking the first maidens seal, the others are well protected by our Hero, the one and only; Tsunashi Takuto and his newfound secret Cybody which he inherited; The Legendary Cybody, TAUBURN. Tsunashi is no one else than a \"Ginga Bishounen\", A Legendary Hero and savior. From this point we follow him through his school-life with his friends Wako, which is a maiden, and Sugata, where Takuto-kun from time to time, has to save Wako from her seal being broken by the evil organization in epic battles for survival.\\n\\n\r\nThe Story:\\n\\n\r\nWhat's particularly interesting in this anime is the story, as it is really paper thin, but brings in alot of enjoyment and some big twists here and there to keep you seated and longing to watch more. The story is told in a beautiful way where we follow Takuto through his everyday life after coming to the Island where he meets different people and does a lot of things a normal, yet popular guy would do, like joining the drama club, yes popular kids in Japan do these things. But the story really takes on its climax where near the end of each episode, Takuto will have to fight different members of the Glittering Crux in order to defend the maids' seals, using different techniques and different abilities in order to prevail. The Story is quite linear and brings an interesting aspect of both school-life and what it would mean to be a Legendary Hero, \"Ginga Bishounen\"(Galactic Pretty boy). As mentioned before it is paper thin, as the real plot and real reason behind why Crux does what it does, will not be revealed until the end of the series. As the fights are astonishing, they are the only way to keep the plot developing further, where as the school-life is  just kind of a filler for the relationship building between our three main characters. Which is sad, i wished that the significance of what happened at school would be well, more significant. But the Enjoyment is there, and the reason I keep coming back is because it manages to pull out the kind of two lives that Takuto live, the way the story goes from School to Mech epicness keeps you sitting in your seat wanting more for each episode. And this is the reason why the story is so great, it captivates you by being nearly invisible, the story is basically the life of a teenager gone Super Hero, and it fits this anime to the stone. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\\n\r\nThe Characters on the other hand are not really that much developed. And are pretty much just regular teenagers, but with the exception of cool looking hairstyles. All of them have a back-story and a past which at some point get revealed and works as a reminder of why they are, who they are right now. But as the most fascinating thing in this story is how the characters interact with each other, which is basically 1/3 of what the anime is about. Not much of character development going on except for Takuto, which has to grow when he finds out that there are a lot more pressure and responsibility on his shoulders than he initially had thought. As far as the interaction between each character goes, each character has his/her own way of doing things and this kind of becomes a testament for how they are as people. Also on a side note many of the Glittering Crux members also have a past which you get to see, because there are a lot more to them than just evil villains, they have their own reasons for doing their deeds. The Characters have some love relations going on between them which also forces out some of the truth they are trying to conceal and not show to others, this brings in more aspects to what's fascinating about the animes characters. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nSound and Animation:\\n\\n\r\nI am a man who is really concerned with the animation and soundtrack of an anime as it may make or break and anime for me. And let me tell you this straight out, bleh.... this anime hits STRAIGHT A'S IN BOTH CATEGORIES. Almost had you there! But dear reader, this anime excels in this category straight out. The wonderfully detailed characters and the use of bright colors, everything is just perfect, the way the robots/mechs fits the characters and how they also made them resemble their users is astonishing. The fights are amazing, the shading and the weaponry are also pretty darn cool. So animation is top notch, and the soundtrack really tingled my senses in a good way. The music fit the animation like no other, like the song \"Monochrome\" which is used right before the summoning of the mechs gives you straight out Goosebumps. The song when Takuto destroys and enemy mech, it gives you the sensation of being there and that you actually won something. The OST is filled with many songs like these and are exactly fit for the situations they are used in, and the beutiful orchestrated music is straight out godly! 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nThis Anime is not something you watch for the plot, so if you are looking for something really plot heavy and something that goes deeper than meets the eye, this is not exactly the anime to serve those needs. But this an anime you sit to on a Saturday just for satisfaction, it has cool characters and huge mech fights, what more could we need? What's interesting is that even if the plot is short to nonexistent it is still pleasant to watch the interactions between characters and how at night Takuto gets to fight big as mechs with his ultra overpowered legendary one. So the strong sides is the way story gets told, from a slice of life point and from the action superhero point. Unfortunately this seems to be good blend actually, it fits each other to some extent that it's actually becoming entertaining. And this show is all about flashy colors, big mechs and overall enjoyment with the removing of the heavy and deep plot. So overall, a great soundtrack, a story and animation which fits the genre, amazing fights and a really entertaining day- school life sets this anime at a strong  8/10 for pure enjoyment. \\n\\n\r\nHope you guys enjoyed this review, if you did please give at thumbs up, and enjoy your day!\\n\\n",

            "content": "Adaptations are becoming a bit of a thorny issue in anime these days, which is a bit odd considering how many are produced every year. The constant conversion of stories from other media is a pretty lucrative business as there's already an established market for the end product and its merchandise, regardless of how good the show actually is. Like anything in life though, there's a price to pay, and there are increasing concerns about the impact adaptations are having on original works. The resulting negative effect on script and screen writers is beginning to be felt throughout the industry as studios everywhere are findingthat their creative teams are slowly becoming unable to develop original concepts into viable storylines. The reason for this is purely because in comparative terms, it takes more effort, imagination and skill to make something original than it does to rework something that already exists, and if one doesn't regularly exercise their \"mental muscles\" in a substantial manner, then their creativity will begin to stagnate.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's the reason why we get anime like Star Driver: Kagayaki no Takuto (Takuto of the Radiance).\\n\\n\r\nThe series begins with Agemaki Wako and Shindo Sugata as the pair take a moonlit stroll along a beach on the fictional Southern Cross Island. Along the way Wako detects the scent of of someone she doesn't know, and following the trail, she and Sugata find a young man who has been washed ashore. He is Tsunashi Takuto, and his arrival on the island will awaken his destiny.\\n\\n\r\nWell, that all sounds pretty heroic, but that's about as far as it goes. Star Driver may initially seem like an interesting proposition, but many of the plot themes are never fully realised, which only exacerbates the fact that there is simply too much going on in the storyline. The series makes some rather nice subtextual introductions at certain points, but no matter how important these may be to plot or character development, they're never fully utilised and thus become the equivalent of the human appendix (i.e. totally useless).\\n\\n\r\nThe storyline progression is handled in the standard \"fight of the week\" manner that is so prevalent in shounen anime and manga, but alongside that Enokido Yoji (series composition and script writer), and director Igarashi Takuya (Soul Eater, Ashita no Nadja, Doremi), have seen fit to add a number of themes that only serve to confuse the audience. In addition to this there are a number of questions that remain unanswered come the end of the series, which may hint at an attempt to have the viewer infer the relevant information rather than outright carelessness.\\n\\n\r\nThat doesn't mean the storyline is bad though. While there may be a degree of confusion, Star Driver does offer up some interesting ideas that could have taken the show in a new direction.\\n\\n\r\nVisually the series is a bit of an odd blend as while the concept is predominantly shounen, several of the male characters have a decidedly bishounen look to them. Star Driver seems to play on this by naming Takuto's alter ego the Galactic Pretty Boy, but it's difficult to tell if this is an attempt to parody the character style. That said, there's a mundanity to the overall design that no amount of beautification can remove, partly because everyone is supposed to look good, but mainly because there seems to be a limited range of expressions.\\n\\n\r\nWhile there are a few scenes that depict specific feelings rather well, the majority of the time the characters display very little emotion, and many of the more expressive moments can seem forced or contrived. In addition to this, the complicated and overly sexualised costumes of Glittering Star, the weird posturing, the rather odd mahou shoujo style transformation sequence when Takuto summons Tauburn, and even the design of Tauburn itself, all promote the idea that Star Driver is a parody anime, and this conflicts with the serious tone of the show.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Tauburn ...\\n\\n\r\nThe conceptualisation of the cybodies is interesting in that it highlights a degree of innovation and originality, which is odd when one considers the slightly banal approach to character design. There's a novelty to the mechas that's nice to see, especially Tauburn's rather obvious court dandy/musketeer influenced look, so the obvious question is why the same innovative approach wasn't taken with the characters themselves. The backgrounds also suffer from a similar mundanity, which is a little disconcerting given the nicely surreal overtones of Zero Time.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the animation, the character movements are pretty standard, but the action sequences are often fluid and well choreographed. Unfortunately this is overshadowed by the the fact that specific scenes have simply been re-used to the point where viewers may find themselves skipping particular moments, and while this tends to be a fairly common practice in \"fight of the week\" shows, it still smacks of laziness.\\n\\n\r\nWhich neatly leads me on to the audio side of the series.\\n\\n\r\nStar Driver initially seems to be well served in the acting department thanks to the experience of Miyano Mamoru (Takuto), Hayami Saori (Wako), Fukuyama Jun (Sugata), and the rest of the cast, so it's a bit strange that many of the roles seem shallow and forced. Part of the reason for this is the lack of facial response on the characters themselves as this gives the impression that the seiyuu are trying too hard, but the script is also to blame as much of the dialogue seems to have been written just to fill in the gaps. All of this makes the voice acting a much more difficult proposition as the seiyuu are often forced to compensate for poor writing.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand the effects are well timed and very clear, and one of the nice things about this show is how it doesn't use music, as background tracks are often reserved for occasions of emotive importance or action sequences. There are also two opening and ending themes for the series, and while they tend to have a slightly upbeat feel to them, they seem to work well with Star Driver's major theme.\\n\\n\r\nPossibly the biggest issue though, is the lack of substantial development on the part of the characters, which could have been somewhat offset had they been clearly defined from the start. Unfortunately this is not the case, and while viewers are given the facade of progression through interactions, conversations, and even action sequences, in reality there is only one thing learned throughout the whole show, and this only occurs in the final episode. In addition to this there are few explanations forthcoming about why the members of Glittering Star are so determined to use the cybodies, and the only thing that seems to tie their actions into the story is something called The Departure (which is another thing that isn't properly explained).\\n\\n\r\nBut that's not the worst part.\\n\\n\r\nIn a nutshell, the characters are dumb, and leading the idiocy is Takuto. The very first episode has him entering the enemy base, but for some reason he \"forgets\" that he's been to the heart of Glittering Star's operation, and so the secret society is left to continue their work relatively unimpeded. This is possibly the biggest hole in the plot as at that point Takuto is aware of the enemy, knows where they and who their target is, and could very easily expedite a much simpler and shorter resolution. Because of this the so-called past traumas, the posturing, the banality of the high school setting, pretty much everything used to define the characters in some manner, all become slightly ridiculous.\\n\\n\r\nSo, where does that leave us? Well, on the surface this seems like a pretty solid proposition, especially with Enokido Yoji (who wrote the screenplay for Diebuster), taking part on the production side, and there are some enjoyable moments that occur throughout the series. Star Driver is nothing if not an interesting idea that tries to approach certain concepts from a different angle, and the little touches of innovation here and there add a pleasing quirkiness to proceedings.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, it's not enough as the series retains a ridiculous quality that isn't helped by a decidedly sub-par script, seemingly emotionless characters, and the lack of any substantial explanations. Star Driver tries to do too much with too little, and the apparent attempts at parodying certain themes only adds to the confusion and makes the plot more convoluted and overly complicated.\\n\\n\r\nThis may not be an adaptation of any sort, but that doesn't mean that it's automatically good, regardless of who worked on it. There are some positives within the series, but ultimately this is nothing more than mediocrity at its finest.\\n\\n\r\nThe fault lies solely with Bones, who in the last two years have produced one original anime franchise (Tokyo Magnitude 8.0). Everything else has been an extension of an existing title, or an adaptation from another medium. Unfortunately they're just one studio out of many that continue to try and cash in on the popularity of something else, with no regard for the effect this has on the viewer or the industry itself. After all, it's easier to blame things like fansubs for falling sales rather than admit that what you've produced is nothing more than average.",

            "content": "Star Driver has been one hell of a polarizing anime since day 1. Some people were initially on board because it looked like a throw-back to old school mecha. Some watched it because it looked like a full on parody of 90's anime with the ridiculous nature of the show combined with the over-the-top style. And even more watched it because it was penned by the same guy who did the composition for Revolutionary Girl Utena, Yoji Enokido. Yet when the credits rolled at the end of episode 25, it was obvious to me and to anyone who stuck with the show that Star Driverwas its own beast so to speak. It incorporated elements of the things I mentioned above yet it never really followed through with any one idea. Surely a mish-mash of these ideas would create schizophrenic anime which tries to do everything and succeeds at nothing, correct? Any other circumstance, I'd tell all of you yes, because there's absolutely no way an anime like that could ever be good. Yet against all odds, I found myself enjoying Star Driver more and more as the weeks went along until I reached the startling conclusion that hey, Star Driver was good! Not just good but pretty damn awesome and compelling! I wrapped my brain around why I was enjoying it so much, when virtually every aspect of the show was working against it. I mean what kind of anime has the audacity to take itself seriously when the main character's title is \"Galactic Pretty Boy\"? The answer is: Star Driver, an anime that somehow manages to pull it all off, and pulls it off with a healthy dosage of fabulousity.\\n\\n\r\nSD's story isn't really something out of the ordinary. A secret organization made up of high schoolers are bent on taking over the world with giant robots that are sealed in a pocket of space/time while some random Mary Sue shows up to thwart them with his own ridiculous giant robot while sporting an equally ridiculous costume and Mahou Shoujo-esque transformation scene. While this is the basic premise of SD (and pretty much every episode), many people will think it gets repetitive pretty soon (and believe me, it does). So why would anyone like it? Well my answer is derived solely from one aspect of the show and that's primarily the subtlety of the execution. The subtle way exposition is fed to the audience, the subtle way characters are presented and written, it makes for a really compelling style. Its one of aspects that made Utena as good and popular as it was. Now I know BONES' anime have a notorious reputation of not holding the audience's hand at all when it comes to story-telling and much of it becomes read in-between the lines or not addressed at all. Star Driver also does this, but only to a degree. It's not so vague that it becomes frustrating but its mysterious enough to compel the audience to continue watching. It gives the audience a chance to think about the plot and characters by themselves and tactfully delivers the answers later at an appropriate time. This is a grand form of storytelling not because the story itself is good but mainly because of the way its presented. Unfortunately while the storytelling borders on masterful, there are some really annoying pacing problems with the whole package. Case in point, most people will drop this in the first 5 or so episodes. I wouldn't blame them because the show has very weak start, where characters are very slowly introduced and the show pretty much relies on the mecha fights to carry it for 20 minutes. Didn't help that the fights were usually only 1-2 minutes long. It slowly builds itself up and it really gets better after episode 7 but I can't really look favorably at the beginning since it could have played up the shows strength which is characterization instead of lolhijinks and boring-as-hell mecha fights. The show also drags towards the end which is honestly baffling to me since there was plenty of material they could have used to make things interesting. Yup, around the end it sort of reverts back to the formula used at the beginning, but thankfully gets its shit together and ends on a strong note. \\n\\n\r\nNow like I said earlier, SD's characters are its strongest point. Even when nothing but high school antics are happening on the screen, there is a sense that everything that happens has some meaning behind it. So when characters often start talking about inane or seemingly pointless topics, it can turn out to be euphemism or a metaphor that has relevance to the plot. Now I don't mean all the antics and comedy have some ulterior theme to them, sometimes there really are comedy scenes to make the audience laugh but more often then not, you'll be thinking about some lines of dialogue long after they've been said. This brings me to another element that SD does really well and that's character interactions. Instead of long flashbacks about something or other, character's personalities are revealed through the way they act around each other, especially when the tone becomes serious. And these are probably the best parts of the show, Sugata's conflict with Takuto, Mizuno general interactions with her sister, Kanoko's demeanor and attitude towards the Glittering Crux and Wako's internal struggle between Takuto and Sugata are all great. Even more impressive is the fact that SD goes out of it's way to characterize minor characters as well as major characters. You can probably argue that Takuto himself is the Mary Sue and isn't characterized worth shit but at the same time you could probably write papers on how his real personality is implied in juxtaposition of the Mary Sue front he shows to all the characters and even the audience. Hell you could even write an essay on how his first phase ability makes him the main character of the show with his catch-phrase \"Dazzling the stage\" as proof of how meta things can appear.  It doesn't go as far as Utena does but it certainly isn't a slouch slouch in that regard. \\n\\n\r\nAs per all BONES anime, the art and animation is done very well. There are loads of awesome sakuga cuts for all the animation fans out there. Generally the fights can be very repetitive with Takuto winning all the time but the animation can make them very exciting sometimes. It doesn't happen too often since I can count the number of times where everything aligns on one hand but when the art, animation, plot and music are all synched in excellence, it becomes very awesome.  But be warned, this isn't really an anime where the mecha fights are the most important part of the show, most of the backlash towards the beginning happened because the mecha bits were actually the worst parts. Mostly because the fights are nothing more than a tool for characterization in the end and you're enjoyment of it will revolve around how much you care for the character that fights Takuto. I won't say the mecha aspect is downright terrible, but I honestly think they could have better implemented the Cybody fights to coincide more with the plot than the characters. Some of the best episodes in the show don't even have any fights in them. The sound on the other hand is really good and is strong throughout the show. SD has some of the best insert songs I've heard in quite a while (like Monochrome) and uses them very efficiently. The other tracks manage to keep up with the vocal ones as well, so its not like the rest of the OST is bleh in comparison. The voice work is also typically good, the best performances come from Jun Fukuyama as Sugata, Ayano Niina as Kanako and Akira Ishida as Head. Can't say I'm not sick of Mamoru Miyano after watching a lot of animu but he pulls off Takuto's happy-go-lucky attitude well enough and still manages to convey his more serious moments with the appropriate tension.  \\n\\n\r\nStar Driver really turned out to be that one show you liked but couldn't really point out why. Kudos to all those people who stuck with it through thick and thin, god knows it tried our patience many times. But for all its apparent shortcomings like derp pacing, flaky mecha moments and wasted potential, it still manged to be one hell of an anime, and a great ride. I'll definitely miss the Saturdays where I stayed up all night into the wee hours of Sunday morning discussing the newest episode and whatnot. If you haven't watched it, I recommend really pushing through those first couple episodes because they're not the best this anime has to offer. Star Driver offers a really unique experience that I haven't seen in much-if any anime, so I strongly recommend it.\\n\\n\r\noh and\\n\\n\r\n(\uff89\u309d\u2200\uff65)~\u30ad\u30e9\u2606 KIRABOSHI!\\n\\n\r\nbecause it had to be done.",

            "content": "You know how, like when you were a kid, you'd ask for a bedtime story that wasn't from the book? For me, that's what Star Driver is. It's one of those stories that's just... different. Maybe there are animes that could be similar, but this one just stands out. \r\nIf you think about it, the story is simple. The Galactic Pretty Boy has to defeat the Glittering Crux Brigade, in order to... well, we're looking for 'save the world', I guess? Other than the names, it sounds pretty generic, but I gave it a perfect 10. Not because of some sort of game-breaking plot devicethat ultimately makes the plot 10 times cooler, but it's simply how they pull it off. Even if some parts are cliche, it's still pretty original.\\n\\n\r\nNow, art. I just have to say, Tauburn is the pimping-est looking mecha in the history of ever. All the mechas (or Cybodys) have very vivid and special qualities, making them different to each other. All with very good color schemes, and unique designs. The characters are pretty well done. Sort of like Code Geass, where they go for the tall skinny characters. But unlike Code Geass, characters are younger, and for me, are a bit more proportioned. I give it a 10.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting, opening theme song, ending theme song, background music, sound effects... Oh, and a special song that plays whenever they fight.... It suits the anime perfectly. There's really not much to say here. No complaints whatsoever. 10.\\n\\n\r\nWell, since I don't want to name names and spoil anything, I shall just refer to them by the color of their hair. Red is the lively and upbeat type of person. Believes in good, yadda yadda, all that jazz. Common in a main character, so no complaints there. Yellow is the normal-ish clueless one, and Blue is the quiet and mysterious ones. Alright, the mains are a bit generic, but as I said earlier, it's how they pull them off. The supporting cast are a colorful (Both hair-color-wise and personality-wise) set really able to help tell the story of Star Driver. Plus, the development with all of them, God, it's just freaking good... (Yes, I can be creepy)\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I really like the anime. I enjoy every episode, and I think a lot more people should watch it. There are currently nine episodes right now, and each one is good. It's an unusual mecha anime, of which the likes I haven't seen in awhile, and of which I hope to see more of soon. \\n\\n\r\nHave fun.",

            "content": "I've never seen an anime get so many high ratings for reviews, while I think it's pretty crappy. I saw this anime in the January 2011 copy of the Japanese Newtype, and thought it seemed interesting enough so I decided to watch it. I liked how the characters looked, and it seemed vaguely interesting, but my high hopes were soon shot down.  I don't know if I am missing the pure genius of this anime, or if I just see past all the jiggling boobs and girls who want to tap everything, and see the series for the pile of nonsense it is.SPOILERS, KINDA SORTA, DOWN THERE VVVV. \\n\\n\r\nThe series had a good start, but after seeing a scene where maids randomly had cat ears and 4 foot bunny ears on, I grew worried of the fate of this series in my eyes. Yada yada, school stuff, yada yada. \"DON'T GO TO THE OLD GOLD MINE KIDS\" -cut scene to gold mine with girl in her discount sexy time outfit- . Why they decided to buy out a circus and Mardi Gras surplus store, and make the girls dress like they are at a S&M club is beyond me. I just can't really take characters seriously if they are looking like a jester reject while wearing a cheesy gold mask with a beak. Just the whole lair in the gold mine thing just baffles me, everything about it. It just seems so stupid to me. Every time they'd have one of their evil group meetings, I'd be forced to wait through 4 minutes of all the girls re-crossing their legs 40 times, and shots of their legs and garters. God forbid we see their faces. There also sometimes would be random cheering or booing from what I will assume are 100 fat old hairy men lurking in the shadows, since They never really show any of the other members. \\n\\n\r\nIn the first 2 episodes, they decided to reuse several scenes like 5 times, and made jokes about 4 times of how wacko, oh i mean Wako is always hungry. There is also really awkward staring scenes between our hero GALACTIC PRETTY BOY and Wako, and throughout the next 4 episodes they try to show that the two are crushing on each other (uh, hello, you already made that clear in the first episode). I thought the mecha stuff was pretty cool, but in the course of 2 episodes having the same type of fights, and the same ending was kind of over kill I think. I'M GOING TO WIN, GRRRRR. -gets destroyed after a few seconds- OH NOO, -stumbles out- FIRST THINGS FIRST, WE ARE TAKING YOUR LITTLE BADGE THING, GET OUT OF HERE AND GO WORK OUT IN YOUR DARK ROOM, YOU AREN'T IN OUR CLUB ANYMORE. Also, what was the point of kidnapping Wako in the first place, if she magically appears in her little bubble thing whenever a fight is going to occur while she is doing random things. Let's just pray that she isn't taking a dump one day, and she is force bubbled into a fight scene. At only 4 episodes in, they don't really explain what all this maiden and mecha stuff is very much. Why do these things even exist? How do only certain people have the power to control them, and why do they have to use those ugly masks? \\n\\n\r\nOh, and apparently every time someone is about to fight, the random fish girl in the cage has to start singing. After 3 or 4 times of this, I had enough. I have no idea who this fish girl is, or why she is in a cage or anything. All she does is just play with a chain, and tell really boring stories to some guy that uses way too much hair gel and just rolls around on some couch. \\n\\n\r\nMe being a girl, and not a lesbian, the naked scenes, boob jiggling, random make out scenes, and panty shots didn't really win me over. Apparently to be in the villain club and a girl, you need to show everyone you are horny, and either make out with people, try to rape them, or be about to kiss them. Apparently the thing to do is to kiss through glass. A moment that made me \"wut\" was when the stacked green hair girl starts regaling the class (while the teacher is talking) about how she is married to some 65 year old and how she gets \"lonely\" at night. Who does this. No on in real life for sure. She also decides to get a hair cut (it doesn't look different) in the middle of the classroom during lunch time. \\n\\n\r\nWhy she lives on a cruise boat and has a alligator in some dirty pool, I have no idea. LOL DON'T WORRY GUIS HE IS A FRIENDLY ALLIGATOR! \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this series had the basis for something really cool, but IN MY OPINION fan service and just trying too hard made this series pretty sucky. I really liked the opening though, so props for that. Too bad I don't like the series. It was pretty bland, and could be a lot more interesting. It was also really confusing at times, and I felt as if parts were cut out or that there was a really sudden scene change. The characters had personality, but some of them showed none or only stood out because of there hair color. Maybe this series gets better in the later episodes, but I think I'll pass on this series. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Before I begin, I must say that I have only seen the first episode. Also, I felt the need to write this based on finding the previous review pretty inarticulate, and slightly off-base, however, people are entitled to their own opinions.\r\nStory: \r\nYes, the previous review was somewhat right, in that there is a lot thrown at you, but it really isn't that hard to keep up with. Also, it's to be expected that the first episode gives the audience a lot in order to pull in a big audience. It also makes me a lot more intrigued than turned off. It is a little overthe top, calling the main character's newfound power \"Galactic Pretty Boy,\" but it was enjoyable, nonetheless, and honestly, there's worse out there.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nArt is great, and so is the action. They insert a mecha fight scene into the 30 min segment that they are given, and it comes in a little randomly, there are many questions that pop up for the audience, but it was done very well.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI loved it. The background music was better than a lot of series I've watched. Opening and closing scenes were nice (and the animation to accompany them was great.)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThis is a little shaky because there was so much introduced in one episode that it makes the characters seem very underdeveloped and random. However, keeping in mind that this is the first episode, and I am very curious as to how it all pans out. I like the characters so far at least.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nREMEMBER - THIS IS A REVIEW BASED ON THE FIRST EPISODE ONLY. \\n\r\nAnyways, I would definitely give this series a try. The opening song with the animation really sparked my curiosity because it revealed a little more about what is to come. The only thing I would really look out for in the upcoming episodes is character development, and obviously plot development (leaving too many questions for the audience, making too many random actions, etc).",

But you loved every minute of it and couldn't stop watching!\r\nWell, Star Driver reminds me of those shows.  Each episode contains the same confrontations, the same transformation sequences, the same fight sequences and same slap-stick comedy between the main trio.  But there's just something about the show that just hooks me to it.  Maybe it's the fact that it movesbeyond shows like Sailor Moon and delivers a decent plot, crisp art, great soundtrack, and extremely likable characters (with pretty costumes to boot!)\\n\\n\r\nTakuto, the show's hero, ends up half drowned on a remote island.  There, he meets Wako, a happy-go-lucky shrine maiden and Sugata, the cool quiet guy.  He ends up going to their school which turns out to be a lair for these giant mecha robots called 'cybodies'.  Turns out most of the school can pilot these things and what do you know, Takuto can pilot one too.  Complete with his own transformation sequence (because guys need them too!), he turns into Ginga Bishounen (Galactic Pretty Boy) to protect Wako from the 'bad' cybodies.\\n\\n\r\nLike I said, story from episode to episode is pretty much the same thing, only with different characters.  But the little side stories and funny moments they add really boosts the enjoyment factor (like Wako's BL fantasies). The beginning episodes give you little snippets and hints for the main plot, then it really starts delving into it starting in episode 20.\\n\\n\r\nArt is superb, it's been the only show where I've actually noticed characters eye movements and blinking.  They definitely did a great job with the details and didn't cheap out with the panels. Even the repeated transformation sequences are quite tolerable with the great graphics ;)  Might I add I love their costume designs too!\\n\\n\r\nThe cast is amazing too, Fukuyama Jun (ie. Lelouch, Grell) plays Sugata,  Miyano Mamoru (ie. Light, Zero) plays Takuto. OP/ENDINGS are catchy and I do like the random songs the characters sing from time to time.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters have taken on almost stereotypical standard character types from anime.  Takuto is the bright, optimistic guy, Sugata is the cool, level headed pretty boy.  Wako is your damsel in distress but still very likable.  While not entirely original, it's been tried and true.  The antagonists are well introduced, each with their background story and specific quirks, they actually don't really feel like bad guys.  It's really easy to get attached to the characters.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, my enjoyment rating is higher than all the other ratings (I gave it a 9), which doesn't really add up.  But I have to say that I am really addicted to this anime at the moment.  I definitely recommend for others to try, maybe more so for the girls since I feel there's some male fanservice going on in here (if the transformation sequence is any indication) =P  All in all, a fun enjoyable watch!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Overall: star driver is a very colorful and action oriented mecha anime which stars a red haired bishonen Takuto.\r\nStory: What can I say, it has been done before, better.  An organization on the island, Glittering Crux wants to unlock the power of the cybodies (the mechs) and use them for....Something.  The cybodies can only be used in zero time, some alternate dimension, and Crux wants to break the powers of the 4 maidens on the island to be able to use cybodies in real space.  This all sounds well in good, its just the execution of the whole concept is pretty subparfor an anime being released in 2010.\\n\\n\r\n-> Note: the reason for the low story marks is because the charecters dick around in school or the island and it is no were near as funny or fulfilling as other mecha anime, namely any Gundam show, or its much closer cousin full metal panic.  If you have not seen full mental panic and are reading this, go see it.  Its infinitely better than Star Driver.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The visuals are fantastic.  The cybodies are colorful and seem as powerful as they are made to seem within zero space.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound is good, but what really stands out is the music.  Particularly the music when members of crux being to enter there cybodies.  Also in the earlier episodes the fish girl songs combined with the regular music score create a 5th element type sythisius of sound and music that is simply perfect.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: the characters are well portrayed, but they are fairly bland when all is said and done.  There is not that much development side from the initial portrayal.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: despite its serious drawbacks with the plot for a modern mecha anime, star driver is a fun, flashy show that should keep you entertained for 20 mintues.\\n\\n",

            "content": "*This review contains spoilers.\r\n\"Grand Entrance! Galactic Pretty Boy! Tauburn!!!\" Such a stupid and embarrassing line that I would never repeat in public in a million years, but there's something about this series that's just so captivating and moving.\r\n'STAR DRIVER: Kagayaki no Takuto (Takuto of the Radiance)' is like a homage to various '70s mecha anime. Everything about this series screams of classic Japanese mecha, superhero, and tokusatsu, while many modern elements, for better or worse, are also incorporated. The surprise is: Everything clicks.\r\nThe story of 'STAR DRIVER' is summarized by caged girl in the beginning and later in the school play: \"Planet of Fish\". Theevil organization \"Kiraboshi\" aims to reach the stars by breaking all 4 seals of Zero Time and activate cybodies in real life. Kiraboshi's leader is akin to Sam in the \"Planet of Fish\" story. On the other hand, Takuto tries to destroy all cybodies so that Mako, the Southern Seal, can leave the island. He represents Mark from the school play. Episodes take the monster-of-the-week format \u00e0 la '70s mecha.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the archetype heroes and villains from classic mecha. Our protagonist Takuto is like one of those classic superhero who's good at everything, likes to help everyone, and has such a strong sense of justice that he's almost naive. Yes, super robots were never meant to be piloted by weak indecisive morons, they were supposed to be piloted by superheroes that kids admire. The hero proactively engaging into the battle to make the world a better place, is a nice change from most recent mecha series. On the other hand, the antagonists are all in an apparently evil organization shrouded by mystery. This character setup is proven to work over and over in iconic classic mecha series.\\n\\n\r\nScene recycling is prevalent like the retro shows, with cybercasket scene looking like classic mecha sortie, Tauburn appearance scenes recycled with CG-assisted backgrounds, hero 'Sailor Moon' transformation into uniform. The enemy mecha even explode with delay, 'Kamen Rider' style, having the protagonist's mecha looking all cool in the foreground after pulling off some awesome move.\\n\\n\r\nAlmost every single mecha moves are borrowed from famous '70s anime. Yes, the pilots even scream out the signature move names! These are just few that I noticed (and still remember):\\n\r\n* Tauburn: \"Tau Galaxy Beam\" - Mazinger Z \"Breast Fire\"\\n\r\n* Tauburn: \"Tau Missile\" - Getter1 \"Shining Spark\"\\n\r\n* Tauburn: \"Galactic Cross Cut\" - Daltanious \"Flame Sword Cross Cut\", Voltes V \"V Letter Cut\"?\\n\r\n* Tauburn: \"Pile\" Attacks - Nu-Gundam \"Fin Funnel\" Attacks\\n\r\n* Tauburn: \"Pile Crusher\" - Getter2 \"Drill Punch\"\\n\r\n* Tetrioht: Bike attack - Combattler V \"Gran Dasher\"?\\n\r\n* Qophlite: Flight mode - Transformers?\\n\\n\r\nThe retro influence can even be found in music for this show. Did the insert songs leading up to, and during battles remind anyone else of 'Mothra'? The two main insert songs were absolutely brilliant. Catchy and well edited, more importantly, godly audio mixing that matched perfectly with every single episode's battle initiation.\\n\\n\r\n\"STAR DRIVER\" must seem like an outdated '70s knockoff by now, but there are also many modern elements mixed in.\\n\\n\r\nStory-wise, the pacing is excellent. It was so captivating that I didn't mind the excessive corniness, and just wanted to know what will happen next. It seems like battle in alternate space is a fad this season, with 'Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica' and 'Yumekui Merry' following the same format. Our heroes are taken to \"Zero Time\" by Kiraboshi in nearly every episode, where they fight like crazy for the fate of the Earth, unbeknownst to rest of the world. The show ends with a generic modern epic final battle where the protagonist transcends an (supposedly) insurmountable power in the universe. We've seen it in other mecha series like 'Gurren Lagann', 'Asura Cryin', 'Heroic Age' etc. Unlike those mecha series with fail endings, 'STAR DRIVER' never got too serious, and maintained the so-bad-it's-actually-good atmosphere throughout by almost making fun of itself by rolling out one retro clich\u00e9 after another, thus the corny ending actually worked.\\n\\n\r\nThe show also had healthy amounts of harem and ecchi. It's true every girl in the show were head-over-heels for Takuto or Sugata. However, both of those two main characters knew exactly who they liked, and also didn't have to act like a thickheaded retards most of the time, and just brushed off girls they're not interested in. Additionally, those guys are supposedly extremely good looking, and have decent personality or mystique, so it wasn't too far-fetched that they were the most popular guys on the island (yes, living in an island give girls limited choice too). The ecchi was present in Kiraboshi female costumes and cybercasket scenes, but the girls didn't trip randomly for panchira and the camera wasn't constantly shooting up to their panties. Although these elements exist as little bonuses, they were never detrimental to the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe modern artwork is magnificent. Mecha, character, and costume designs were very unique, and the battle scenes were very exciting with fluid action. The visuals were so nice that the horrible CG-assisted recycled scenes seemed to be deliberately done for '70s influence, so-bad-it's-actually good. While the scenery in Zero Time was always amazing, the ordinary world was a bit too bland.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is wonderful, especially for that of Takuto, Kanako, and Keito. All of were perfect fit for respective characters, and very emotional tones in key scenes. BGM were decent, some of them quite memorable. The OP by Aqua Timez was perfect for the theme, and addictive like most of their tie-ups.\\n\\n\r\n'STAR DRIVER' was a highly nostalgic mecha series for me, which successfully blended the tried-and-true retro qualities with clich\u00e9 modern elements to create something completely different. Admittedly, there is the gayness of Galactic Pretty Boy and Kiraboshi members, the abundant corniness, and certain plot holes (like why don't they just shoot Takuto in real life?) that the viewer must overcome, but I believe series like this is what anime is all about. This is one of those series where you have to stop thinking and just feel the show. Is there still a child in you?",

            "content": "Star Driver is a perfect example of a show that takes a simple formula and makes the resulting show wayyyy more complicated than it needs to be. The formula that I am talking about (monster of the week) is common in kids shows. Yes, kids shows! You know those shows that you loved when you were 10 but you 'grew out of?' Well, I WOULD describe this show as sort of a teenagers version of a 'Monster of the week', except this show probably takes on the themes of at least 2 other shows through the time that I was watching it. For a 26episode anime, this is simply too much to do in a 25 minute show in my opinion, especially since a third of the episode is taken up by a fight scene (every episode, hence Monster of the week).\\n\\n\r\nAnother issue with this show is the characters. I could find ONE character that I liked. The rest of the characters could all just disappear and I honestly would not give a shit. I'll try to describe the characters despite this. We have the three main characters - Takuto, well I could not find anything special about his character but apparently he can summon a robot under certain conditions and uses dual swords. Then we have Sugata and Wako, who are trapped on the island that this anime is set in for various reasons. Sugata and Wako are also engaged(not really important to the main story). I don't feel like describing the rest of the characters because\\n\r\n1. Too many characters. Way too many. \\n\r\n2. The characters are all forgettable, partly because of 1. Except for Mizuno. Maybe it's because I actually sympathized with here and she didn't suck as much as the other characters did, including Takuto and co.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation in this show was bright, colourful, fluid, all that jazz. However I do have an issue with the character designs. The characters all look like stick figures. It doesn't help this show's case that the main character looks more like a pussy than the smallest guy in my school. Also, I think they colour coded the character hair so that we could actually identify the characters from each other because they were so uninteresting otherwise.\\n\\n\r\nMusic/sound in the show was nothing to complain about really. The only problem with this section is that it is never explained why the girl in the cage is singing the song before the main characters jump to that other dimension (Zero Time). To me this seems like the show is giving the song meaning for no reason at all.\\n\\n\r\nI don't know what else to say about this show. The concept of it sounded pretty cool at before I began to watch it but the series ended up being really boring because of a bunch of themes scattered all over the place and really uninteresting characters. I don't think I even got the character names right because of how uninteresting they are. Most of the characters contribute almost nothing to the story and are just there to fill time while the  main villain just goes about his business. I don't think I will ever finish watching this show because I highly doubt the ending will save it for me. I don't really have an issue with 'monster of the week shows', but the parts between the fighting were really boring and pointless. I think I would have just preferred an endless series of fights. \\n\\n\r\nTo summarize, I would not recommend this show unless you really enjoy huge fighting mecha anime. You won't be thrilled at the characters/story so it would be best to just tolerate them while waiting for the inevitable clash between two huge robots. Otherwise, there are plenty of shows with cool characters that you can relate to and don't make watching a freaking show seem so much like a chore.\\n\\n\r\nI hope this review is helpful. \\n\\n\r\nThis is my first review so feel free to message me and give me advice on how I can improve my future reviews. \\n\\n",

I my self is victim to this why become Star Driver yes has mechs, has sexy babes but that's where everything ends. Its not bad its just the flow of the story and character interaction has not been very\"Interactive\". Yes I have watch 6 episode of the series and will watch it to the end because it will be unfair to judge it this early. \\n\\n\r\nGood Point\\n\r\n1. Story good enough its not your typical new guy in school meets people then meets friends fight bad guys save girl then that's it. So far The main character has to fight against his entire school (I mean it every one in his school) to protect the girl. Yes its not very original but come on the entire school population is against him and wants to kick is ass. \\n\\n\r\nBad Points\\n\r\n1. Bad flow yes its to early but in 6 episodes and still the same thing. Fight other students in mask (some are hot female students by the way ^_~) and every time he defeats one they just go by there way no revenge or friendship growth with the main character nor do they interact with the main character.\\n\\n\r\nThis series reminds me so much of magical girls like sailor moon etc. but for the male version. Its not bad but the lack of flow early in the story is about to poor. I know its still the build up stage but six episode just fighting like magical girls with mech's is pathetic - yet original + so being balance is your chose when you watch this.\\n\\n\r\nJust finished it so kept my promise...\\n\r\nLast thing is you watch it your self and judge it. So that's that hope that this helps you guys.",

            "content": "This series was giving me a number of vibes connected to Code Geass and I don't mean that in a good way. Star Driver appeared to be trying to mix around the classic archetypes of super robot anime, slice-of-life high school comedy and the over-the-top elements of Code Geass. If the series ran for the most part as a comedy like Gurren Lagann where it didn't take itself seriously, then I would have found myself liking this series quite well. Instead the series tries to take itself seriously yet with the many eccentric traits of the characters, it comes across as rather awkward and hardto take seriously just like Code Geass and is bogged down by quite a good number of issues in its plotting. Many episodes tend to run in a similar setup:\\n\\n\r\n1. Takuto is enjoying himself with Wako and Sugata.\\n\r\n2. Random member of Glittering Crux in the student body meets with him or tries causing mischief.\\n\r\n3. Member decides to challenge Takuto to Cybody battle.\\n\r\n4. Takuto overcomes foe.\\n\r\n5. Repeat for much of the show's run. \\n\\n\r\nThis was quite a repetitious setup for each episode and made things appear to be mostly episodic for the show. In addition, the show doesn't really bother going into great detail into its major elements such as what led to each of the students in Glittering Crux to join the group, how Cybodies came to be, how humanity came to discover them and why the Glittering Crux did not dispose of Takuto away from Cybody battles if they desired world domination so badly. The ending also came across as rather weak with a shallow baddie unveiling himself, elements of deus ex machina and failing to provide a proper resolution to the love triangle that later develops with Takuto, Wako and Sugata.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some elements to the plotting of Star Driver that did work well for me and kept me from dumping it much earlier on. The series does do well at fleshing out and developing the bond between Wako, Takuto and Sugata showing that the three come to greatly care for one another, even as they are aware of the complicated situation they have to overcome with the Glittering Crux and their love triangle. Marino's character arc even lays out some heart-wrenching and deep-seated issues with her that are not as apparent with her on the surface.\\n\\n\r\nOn the visual end, Star Driver does have clean artwork delivering a decent amount of detail on mecha, character and scenery designs; as well as having its moments of fluid animation during fights between Cybodies. There are some noticeable occasions where the visual quality can drop quite a bit, particularly in some scenes during the middle and last episodes.\\n\\n\r\nIf you could put up with and enjoy the bizarre and over-the-top developments of Code Geass, then you might be able to enjoy Star Driver more than I did. Otherwise, be prepared for a mostly mediocre romp that tries to blend together the elements I mentioned above yet comes across as hard to care for because it doesn't cover its major elements and is hard to take seriously when it tries to be so.",

            "content": "Sometimes, you get a work that \u201cdoesn't know what it wants to be\u201d \u2013 shows with a confused tone and jumbled presentation that tried to reach for too many different elements and couldn't grasp them all.  Star Driver is different.  In a weird way, it's a show that knows exactly what it wants to be... but somehow manages to be ignorant of what it is, leading to it rather shamefully squandering loads of potential.\r\nSo what did Star Driver want to be?  It wanted to be a teen drama/romance mecha fighting show with a 'surprising' emotional heart to it \u2013 a spectacle ofaction and young love with a zest for life.  The problem is that most of these core elements are... kind of poorly handled.\\n\\n\r\nLet's talk about the action.  This is Star Driver's biggest, and probably most insulting problem.  The animation for the action scenes (and the show in general) is gorgeous.  It's bright, it's colorful, it's fast, it's flowing... every moment is easy to 'read' and carries a lot of meaning and impact when it wants to.  The issue is that the fight choreography is terrible.  Most of the mecha battles in the show have very few twists and turns, not a lot of action from either side, and are actually terribly short when you cut out all the long (if pretty) repeated or nearly repeated intro and outro animations.  In fact, I'd say that for the first two thirds of the show, the average mecha battle has maybe thirty seconds of actual robots fighting.  This would be bad on its own, but it's especially grating when the show spends several times as much time on the setup and wind down as it does on the actual meat of the action scenes.  Repeated animation (especially when there is some variation) isn't bad on its own, but when it outweighs by far anything you do with said animation, you've got problems.  I'd contrast this with a show like Kill la Kill, which clearly didn't have enough money to have constant, detailed, good-looking animation like Star Driver, but more than made up for it with excellent choreography and a good sense of what makes a fight scene engaging.\\n\\n\r\nBecause it isn't (just) how cool the fighters look.  Star Driver has that down, but it fails on other elements.  For instance, there needs to be an ebb and flow of combat.  The best fight scenes, whether they're quick or long, do their best to have each side gain and lose the upper hand multiple times, or at least for good reasons why the tides turn.  You want to see the heroes on the ropes and rally, and to believe in the threat of the villain you also want to see them rally and counter what the hero does now and then.  In Star Driver, most fights start with the villian showing off, and then Takuto turns it around and wins in one hit before you can really appreciate the recovery, and there's never, at least until the final episodes that get this a little better, a fight where the villain can present a continuing threat and the hero's victory doesn't feel trivial or automatic.\\n\\n\r\nFurther, good fight scenes establish investment in what the fight is about.  You can have two characters beating each other up, but viewers won't be invested unless they understand why these characters are beating each other up.  Star Driver, for all that it actually gives a lot of focus to its villain of the week (too much, if you ask me) fails to establish the stakes that are why Takuto fights against the Kiraboshi Order of the Cross.  OK, they were trying to... um... hurt a girl?  Nullifying Wako's seal would seem to be something that would sting, and it's a pretty jerk thing to do, but beyond that?  What they'd actually like to do with the cybodies once they're unleashed?  It's marvelously unclear; we know that they would have power sufficient to be players on a global stage, but we don't know why they want that power as a group or what they intend to do with it.  And, in fact, individual members of the Kiraboshi Order of Silly Costumes seem to have different opinions: One wants to make money,  another wants outsiders off her darn island, another seems to want some kind of justice... they have too many individual goals to really mesh as a group.  This means, as a weird conspiracy, they're too unfocused for us to really feel threatened by them: they could use those cybodies to burn nations and rule the world with an iron fist or they could use them to make shoes for orphans; the show doesn't really care.  They're kind of jerks to Wako, and while that may be all the motivation Takuto needs, it's not all the motivation we need to be with him when he's putting his life on the line for it.\\n\\n\r\nFrom all of this, we get the main weakness of the show: it spends way too much time and effort in singular areas, and fails to support them properly.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast is another example of this.  The main characters are, oddly enough, some of the least interesting characters in the show.  Takuto, Sugata, and Wako are (in that order) Bland, Blander, and Blandest.  I can kind of forgive Takuto for this \u2013 being the male lead is never easy, and at least he has something of a personality but Sugata and Wako have the defining features of slightly broody cardboard and damp cardboard.  The best thing I can really say about them is that the show does at least seem to know that they're deprived of characterization, and doesn't try to insultingly tell us facts that aren't shown.  They have nothing, but that could and would be worse than nothing, and at least they're consistent in how blandly vaguely nice or so they are.\\n\\n\r\nThe weird thing is that the side characters are actually rounded and developed.  Minor villains that are relevant for one or two episodes over the entire course of the show have hopes, dreams, and backstories that give them more personality and deeper characters than our leads pretend to have, while more significant side characters like Mizuno or Kate can do even more, and their struggles have the capacity to carry entire arcs that our leads couldn't support.\\n\\n\r\nAnd as with the raw beauty of the animation, you might ask yourself: \u201cIsn't that a good thing?\u201d.  But the problem is that it comes at the expense of things that are more important.  The show, as a whole, could have been stronger if we spent less time with all the nobodies and also-rans in the Kiraboshi Order of Unclear Goals, and more time establishing our main characters as people, or building up some relevance to the battle over the cybodies.  Maybe a couple of the villains could get full supporting character development, but only ones that could actually tie in, rather than distracting from what's actually important here.\\n\\n\r\nI say this especially because, once the show actually gets around to giving answers and doing things that aren't just developing Kiraboshi Order of Angst mooks or giving us the 90% same fight every episode... it actually has good answers and good elements.  The final arc's involvement with Sugata is a great turn of events, but it's squandered because he says probably half a dozen words after the turn.  The villain's master plan is great, and in a better work with a better explored villain it could have been something amazing... but we only learn about it in the literally final episode, mere minutes before he's defeated for good.  Other arcs, involving the Shrine Maidens and even the heroes would have had more of an impact if the show as a whole had been paced better, introducing topics, letting them sit with us, and developing them over the passage of time so they have some natural growth, rather than just throwing them at us and resolving them about as suddenly.  The entire structure of Star Driver is like drive-by storytelling: Plots, and not ones that benefit from the element of surprise, appear out of nowhere, hit you, and then disappear as suddenly.  On the whole, the last act of the show is, again, a bit better about this than the show as a whole, but by the time you get there the damage has already been done.\\n\\n\r\nSCORE BREAKDOWN\\n\r\nStory: 4 (the pacing is wrong and it doesn't know what to focus on)\\n\r\nArt: 7 (It's very pretty, but poorly used)\\n\r\nSound: 8 (This is strong; the Voice Acting is spot on and Monochrome is a beautiful song)\\n\r\nCharacter: 5 (There are good characters, but they're the wrong characters)\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\r\nTOTAL: 5.8 (6)\\n\\n\r\nVerdict: Some shows are vastly more than the sum of their parts, using elegant structures and moments of brilliance to spin straw into gold and make something amazing or impressive out of bits and pieces that wouldn't be that good on their own.  Star Driver is the opposite: it takes a bunch of good pieces and proves, that with bad pieces placed in exactly the wrong places, all those good elements can fail to add up to anything worthwhile.  It's not the worst show I've seen, not by a long shot.  It isn't even particularly bad.  But all the same, it's enough of a waste that I really couldn't and wouldn't recommend it.",

Futhermore, the story is more about a bunch of teen-agers with Cybodies and powers to manipulate the so called \"Zero time\" who do what every adrenaline filled teen-agers does, and that is DUKING OUT WITH EACH OTHER.\\n\\n\r\nArt-Rating, a dreadful number 2.\\n\\n\r\nWhat gives?\\n\r\nCo'z  the way the characters school uniforms, Glittering Crux Brigade members attire to the Cybodies are gay, gay and gay. Let's start with the school uniform especially the tie, it looks like an inverted penis, for the girls the tie looks like an inverted penis with balls in the sides of thier collars, 2nd the Glittering Crux Brigade's attire, nearly all of the girls dresses in an S & M outfit while the guys dress in a heavy metal band. Also the Cybodies look like a poster symbol for Anorexia, which somehow how makes me think that the artist of this anime seems to be promoting it. I also hate both artist and author's concept of making the members of  Glittering Crux Brigade to wear funny looking masks that looks good when in a royal french party. \\n\\n\r\nSound- Rating, a very good 8.\\n\\n\r\nNo comment here.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- Rating, a very good 8.\\n\\n\r\nI really like the roles that Takuto Tsunashi, Wako Agemaki and Sugata Shind\u014d  play. However, it is a bit confusing as to who is the main villan of this anime. It may be possible that Sugata Shindo could be Takuto's enemy. So, I guess will find out in the end of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall- a fair number 6. \\n\\n\\n\r\nTrivia: The story of \"Robinson Crusoe\" was inspired by a real life castaway Alexander Selkirk who was strandred in an island a few miles off of Chile for 4 years.",

            "content": "Star Driver, as an anime, is quite a formula. However, it does its formula extremely well, meshing together a deep story, outstanding characters, haunting music, and beautiful art to create an anime that should not be missed this season.\r\nStory: I find the story to be deeper then you might get from the start. While it is very heavy handed with dropping important plot related issues without explaining them (hence the 8), the story ends up being much more then a loose way to generate episodes. Sure, each episode is a formula, starting with a slice of life in the start transitioning into a flashy mechabattle in the end, but what it does inside the context of the formula is spectacular. There is so much hidden within the context and between the lines that it will appreciate long into the future, as an anime you watch first for the action, and again to get the best understanding of it.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Star Driver does not disappoint. Each cybody (mecha) is unique, colorful, and well animated, in colorful tie-die environments. Each character is unique in style and poise, unique enough that you can spot most anyone from a distance (just by hair color!). The wide shots give the sense of beauty that you would want from an island. A nice fusion of hand drawn and computer drawn that gets a small bit noticeable (only if you look really closely) but ads a nice dynamic to the look of the fight scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The Intro/Outro music is well and good, but the true beauty comes from the songs sung (yes, sung) during the show. Each of the three melodies (possibly four) that we know of so far are hauntingly simple, ear worm style pieces that will stick in your mind long after you're done watching an episode. It's quite a change, and an enjoyable one. In terms of sound effects, everything is spot on, and well done, so there isn't much else to say about it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Every character has their due on Star Driver. Characters that you thought gone due to the Monster of the Day formula come back to influence the plot yet again. Each person has a darker side to them, each has their dirty secrets, and all are interconnected to each other in ways that transcend the anime it's self. That being said, it does take a little while for this ball to get rolling, and however fantastic the characters might be, having them start out simple isn't the best impression.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This show will make you smile, laugh, gasp, and want to watch more. This show is a show you tell your friends about, you get them to watch it, and you laugh about how seriously absurd it is. This is one of those shows that will be watched over and over again, a fantastic reference point for future mecha anime shows. This is a show that doesn't lose themselves in politics, in emotion, in statements about human emotion. This is a show that is fun. It is fun enough that you can watch and enjoy it, but deep enough to analyze to your heart's content.\\n\\n\r\nSummary:\\n\\n\r\nWatch this thing. Watch it once. Then again. Love it for its simplicity and action. Dive into it for its deeper statements. Anyone who thought shows like Neon Genesis and Code Geass could sometimes get too deep into themselves and just wants to see great fight scenes will be at home. Those who liked those shows for their complexity and subtle brilliance will love the story and the hidden connections, implications, and just general mind-screw that the show will give you.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: Good, you skipped to this. Watch + Download this now.",

            "content": "Everthing must come to an end, today it was Star Driver.\r\nWhile it was amazing at the beginning, it started slowly getting bad.\r\nStory:\r\nThe setting itself is intruduced in a rather rushed way, but showed a lot of potential. Sadly, it went down to a \"which boy will Wako choose?\" and \"Takuto beats down the Kiraboshi\" without very much development.\r\nArt:\r\nI don\u00b4t have much to complain here. It was a bit too colorful in my opinion, but especially in the fighing scenes, you could see were all the graphic-work went. \r\nSound:\r\nThe soundtrack was maybe one of the most outstanding features of the anime; the tracks themselves felt good,and the insert songs were a great addition. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nHere it stars going downhill.\\n\r\nMost characters hardly change from your first impression. From my point of view, exept the love-triangle centering Wako, there is almost no character development at all. Most of the female characters even fell in love with Takuto or Sugata to a certain extent, at the very least they didn\u00b4t see them as enemies anymore.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nTakuto comes. Takuto fights. Takuto saves the day.\\n\r\nThat\u00b4s basicly what every episode was about.\\n\\n\r\nWith the sole exeption of Head, most of the Kiraboshi-members somehow didn\u00b4t take their goal serious, beeing all nice to Takuto or even becoming his friends outside of the fights. Until shortly before the end, no one got at least once the idea to fight him with more than one Cybody. It seems that defeating/killing him outside of a Cybody was never an option either as well, since nobody tried even once.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the story, you hardly feel like anything important happened since episode 2, because there is hardly any new plot-related information at all (ignoring a bunch of other love-relationships).\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI really liked Star Driver when it started, then it became a single sided \"Takuto ownez them with some new/old technique or help from Sugata\" - business with a featured \"girl in love\" theme. More background to everything Cybody-releated might have helped alot.",

            "content": "Star Driver is a confusing story of a bunch of kids trying to take over the world. Well, in essence. This show literally can take anything and throw it at you. Sometimes this works, and sometimes\u2026 well it doesn\u2019t. The less critical you are of every little detail the more and more enjoyable it can be.\r\nThe story takes place on a small island with a big secret. There exist giant robots that are sealed away by the maidens of the island. The Glittering Crux desires to release these upon the world. As the seals are broken they come closer and closer to being released intothe real world. However, it is up to the Takuto to dazzle the stage and prevent them from breaking free from the dimension they inhabit! Again and again he fights them off like a true hero! While this is all fine and good and he is quite dazzling\u2026 the combat becomes quite repetitive. Sure each Cybody, robot, is unique and has its own gimmick but the fights all feel the same. There is no feeling of urgency as you see Takuto kick ass without any scratches every time. Thankfully if you brave it out the final battles are more unique, interesting, and well, closer to the quality of something that those people can say is \u201cBONES quality action.\u201d That said if I had to grade solely on the episodic action segment it would be pretty bad. However, the stuff taking place outside of Zero Time, the dimension cybodies are sealed in, is a lot more enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Star Driver cover every archetype out there. We have the rich ojou who lives on a huge boat and has two servants one of the few I have ever liked, the studious serious mysterious class representative, and a free spirited girl who believes in magic. As a matter of fact, the female lead is one of the least interesting and unique one that comes to mind. She is, however, the maiden which Takuto and Sugata fight to protect. Takuto is very admirable, kind, and the way he enters the battle saying \"Dazzling the stage, galactic pretty boy\" pretty much sums up how he does everything. Sugata is very serious and always looking out for Wako. He is also very quiet and doesn't like to be upfront about what he does.  Each and every one of the characters have something about them that will leave an impression on you at one point. If there is one thing Star Driver does right, it is weaving in episodes for each character. Unfortunately I will not elaborate on the characters more because the bulk of what is interesting about the show is finding out who they are.\\n\\n\r\nYes, through the first chunk of episodes they introduce all the characters of the story. Depending on if you like said character the episode can be a hit or miss. The \u2018good guys\u2019 consisting of the mains interact through these supporting roles in order to show us each side of the story. By each side I imply that these others are always somehow involved with the cybodies on the island. They don\u2019t go to great lengths to hide their identities, at least to the viewers. The Glittering Crux only wear masks, and when you\u2019re the only person with that hair color AND that seiyuu it is sort of hard to not make the connection. \\n\\n\r\nThe romance in this ends up sucking for something original and not ongoing. There is not much progress in this although Wako spends all of her time uselessly fawning over our male leads. There are a few good moments but in sort, do not hope for much here.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the interesting things is the parallelism they make between the story of the characters and the that of which is told behind the scenes by Sakana of \"Sam the Squid Piercer.\" It tries to put an artistic or descriptive background on what I was watching and was just one of the many little things that I found interesting. Another little repetitive quirk: The animation scene is the same every time zero time is activated and people board their cybody. The sequence takes a good minute at least, and the same (awesome imo) insert is played for it, switching once half way through. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThere is one thing that can't really be described - Star Driver somehow gets you pumped up. The battles aren't stunning, the story takes a while to kick in, but there is just something that makes you want to say 'this is pretty awesome!' every time you click the play button. So as a disclaimer; If you don't get pumped up at all in the first episode it definitely won't happen at all. If you lose this after episode one feeling by sticking it out a bit longer till episode 6 or 9 for two good arcs. From there it only gets better.\\n",

I would have moments where I was hesitant to continue watching episodes, maybe looking at all the episodes I still have yet to watch and thinking about how they were going to fill them all, but, when I finally did decide to continue, there was just something that hooked me and made me fall in love with this anime all over again.\r\nThis anime reminds me of Gundam Seed, except with less action and more character development. This anime has a pretty big cast of characters andwhile some didn't get the exploration I think they deserved (come on! George and Tetsuya are the hottest guys in the anime and they're barely in it! I feel ripped off! I need my eye candy! D:), this show just seems to have a way of making you fall in love with characters you never thought you would fall in love with and, in the end, I think that's something about the show that is simply amazing, it makes you love its characters so much.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of people felt that the lore was really esoteric, but I followed it all pretty easily and it's certainly not any more out there than a lot of other animes I've watched. When it's at its worst, this anime is a simple, plain Mecha anime with a mystic twist, not bad, just a little plain, but, when it decides to get its act together, oh, can it ever be good! There are twists which I was amazed at and moments that tugged at my heartstrings. Mizuno, who I really didn't like at first as she seemed annoying and childish, has such an amazing arc that had me amazed when the big twist finally came and, in the end like every other character, I came to love her so much! This anime definitely gets better as it goes, building off of what the earlier episodes work hard to set down and make the audience comfortable with, until it becomes great. This is also an anime that, even though it's protagonist is male, is arguably a female-driven anime with the majority of characters being female and having the most time dedicated to them and their character developments. Overall, it's definitely not an anime for everyone and I think it may be better for some people to watch the movie instead as it works to streamline the story, but, overall, I definitely don't regret watching this anime. It's not good enough for me to consider watching it again, but it's definitely one I'm glad to have watched and to have in my completed collection.\\n\\n\r\nStill, the extra content in the movie is so amazing, especially if you've watched the whole anime. If anything, those few extra minutes gives this anime a huge boost.\\n\\n\r\nThis is an anime that I find very hard to grade, there are things I adored, but also things that hold me back so, overall, I have to give it 7.5 cybodies out of 10, maybe a bare 8 with the extra movie content attached one.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the adventures of life continue on.... :)",

            "content": "In a boring world, there are youngsters who seek thrills while having their spirit be their guide. And what could be better than swimming to an Island infested with a evil organization destined to destroy the world, in order to find the fabulous school-life while being a \"GINGA BISHOUNEN\"? Welcome to the world of Star Driver: Takuto of Radiance, a glorious anime filled with thrills and school drama. But let's not forget the giant robots that fight for their goals, which will prevail, Good or Evil? Ladies and Gentlemen, let's not waste more time and jump right in!\r\nI will put my review into these categories;Overview, Story, Characters, Sound and Animation, and my overall enjoyment which serves as a conclusion!\\n\\n\r\nThe overview:\\n\\n\r\nThe Story takes place on a Island somewhere in Japan, location unknown, where we follow in the footsteps of our prettyboy and real main character Tsunashi Takuto, in his search for his father and nothing more than the thrill of being young and adventours. What seemed to be a regular Island contains a dark past, where an organization known as The Glittering Crux has evil plans to break an ancient seal, in order to bring the sealed Mechs called Cybodies into the realm of living. The seal is contained within four maidens of the Island chosen by bloodline in order to defend the seal and prevent it from breaking. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the Glittering Crux is successful in breaking the first maidens seal, the others are well protected by our Hero, the one and only; Tsunashi Takuto and his newfound secret Cybody which he inherited; The Legendary Cybody, TAUBURN. Tsunashi is no one else than a \"Ginga Bishounen\", A Legendary Hero and savior. From this point we follow him through his school-life with his friends Wako, which is a maiden, and Sugata, where Takuto-kun from time to time, has to save Wako from her seal being broken by the evil organization in epic battles for survival.\\n\\n\r\nThe Story:\\n\\n\r\nWhat's particularly interesting in this anime is the story, as it is really paper thin, but brings in alot of enjoyment and some big twists here and there to keep you seated and longing to watch more. The story is told in a beautiful way where we follow Takuto through his everyday life after coming to the Island where he meets different people and does a lot of things a normal, yet popular guy would do, like joining the drama club, yes popular kids in Japan do these things. But the story really takes on its climax where near the end of each episode, Takuto will have to fight different members of the Glittering Crux in order to defend the maids' seals, using different techniques and different abilities in order to prevail. The Story is quite linear and brings an interesting aspect of both school-life and what it would mean to be a Legendary Hero, \"Ginga Bishounen\"(Galactic Pretty boy). As mentioned before it is paper thin, as the real plot and real reason behind why Crux does what it does, will not be revealed until the end of the series. As the fights are astonishing, they are the only way to keep the plot developing further, where as the school-life is  just kind of a filler for the relationship building between our three main characters. Which is sad, i wished that the significance of what happened at school would be well, more significant. But the Enjoyment is there, and the reason I keep coming back is because it manages to pull out the kind of two lives that Takuto live, the way the story goes from School to Mech epicness keeps you sitting in your seat wanting more for each episode. And this is the reason why the story is so great, it captivates you by being nearly invisible, the story is basically the life of a teenager gone Super Hero, and it fits this anime to the stone. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\\n\r\nThe Characters on the other hand are not really that much developed. And are pretty much just regular teenagers, but with the exception of cool looking hairstyles. All of them have a back-story and a past which at some point get revealed and works as a reminder of why they are, who they are right now. But as the most fascinating thing in this story is how the characters interact with each other, which is basically 1/3 of what the anime is about. Not much of character development going on except for Takuto, which has to grow when he finds out that there are a lot more pressure and responsibility on his shoulders than he initially had thought. As far as the interaction between each character goes, each character has his/her own way of doing things and this kind of becomes a testament for how they are as people. Also on a side note many of the Glittering Crux members also have a past which you get to see, because there are a lot more to them than just evil villains, they have their own reasons for doing their deeds. The Characters have some love relations going on between them which also forces out some of the truth they are trying to conceal and not show to others, this brings in more aspects to what's fascinating about the animes characters. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nSound and Animation:\\n\\n\r\nI am a man who is really concerned with the animation and soundtrack of an anime as it may make or break and anime for me. And let me tell you this straight out, bleh.... this anime hits STRAIGHT A'S IN BOTH CATEGORIES. Almost had you there! But dear reader, this anime excels in this category straight out. The wonderfully detailed characters and the use of bright colors, everything is just perfect, the way the robots/mechs fits the characters and how they also made them resemble their users is astonishing. The fights are amazing, the shading and the weaponry are also pretty darn cool. So animation is top notch, and the soundtrack really tingled my senses in a good way. The music fit the animation like no other, like the song \"Monochrome\" which is used right before the summoning of the mechs gives you straight out Goosebumps. The song when Takuto destroys and enemy mech, it gives you the sensation of being there and that you actually won something. The OST is filled with many songs like these and are exactly fit for the situations they are used in, and the beutiful orchestrated music is straight out godly! 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nThis Anime is not something you watch for the plot, so if you are looking for something really plot heavy and something that goes deeper than meets the eye, this is not exactly the anime to serve those needs. But this an anime you sit to on a Saturday just for satisfaction, it has cool characters and huge mech fights, what more could we need? What's interesting is that even if the plot is short to nonexistent it is still pleasant to watch the interactions between characters and how at night Takuto gets to fight big as mechs with his ultra overpowered legendary one. So the strong sides is the way story gets told, from a slice of life point and from the action superhero point. Unfortunately this seems to be good blend actually, it fits each other to some extent that it's actually becoming entertaining. And this show is all about flashy colors, big mechs and overall enjoyment with the removing of the heavy and deep plot. So overall, a great soundtrack, a story and animation which fits the genre, amazing fights and a really entertaining day- school life sets this anime at a strong  8/10 for pure enjoyment. \\n\\n\r\nHope you guys enjoyed this review, if you did please give at thumbs up, and enjoy your day!\\n\\n",

            "content": "What makes a show enjoyable? Obviously, the answer to this question will differ from person to person since not everyone has the same taste. That being said, Star Driver is easily one of the most enjoyable shows I've watched in recent years. It's just fun and so very very FABULOUS. This show really reminded me what it's like to truly enjoy a series despite its faults and plot holes. During every fight I was rooting for Takuto and often I was on the edge of my chair in excitement. Everything from the over-the-top battles and transformation sequences to the very likable and interesting characters madethis show a pleasure to behold.\\n\\n\r\nI'd like to just leave it at that and hope that my genuine enthusiasm for the show will rub off on you, but obviously to give a fair analysis and better understanding of what you're getting into I'm going to break it down traditionally by story, art, sound, character, and my enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nStory: The general plot can be oversimplified down to there's people who have giant trans-dimensional robots who want to fight Takuto's robot so they do and get royally owned. This in its own right (coupled with the fantastic soundtrack) can be enjoyable on its own. However, the story goes much further in many unexpected ways as we learn more and more about this bizarre \"Glittering Crux Brigade\" and what they're trying to accomplish. The general tone of the story is quite varied in how it will switch from comedy, to mech battles, to romance, and suddenly to drama and back again.\\n\r\nSomething that's very important to note about Star Driver's story is that it requires a good amount of suspension of disbelief. If you've watched anime long enough perhaps you've cultivated this skill. Otherwise, you might be turned off by the sheer absurdity of it. It's not the series' strong point, but if you can revel in its absurdity, overlook the plot holes, and embrace the ridiculous outfits: you'll find a good story with excellent pacing that is neither too slow or fast. (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art of Star Driver is beautiful, unique, and often fluid. This is what first grabbed my attention when I looked into this series. When they're not in \"Zero Time\" the background art of this island looks like paradise and is very pleasing to the eye. When they jump into \"Zero Time\" and start the mech battles, everything gets dialed up to 11. The Mechs look absolutely fantastic while also being hand-drawn. The scenery in \"Zero Time\" is space-themed and is so beautiful that it's hard not for it to take your breath away. Check out a battle on youtube if you're not convinced.\\n\r\nThe character animation is done by Bones and as a fan of their previous works like Darker Than Black I was very pleased with the results. Putting a number rating on something so inherently subjective is rather pointless, but I thoroughly enjoyed the art and animation and thus I feel that it deserves special recognition. (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nSound: YOU ARE MY ONLY SHOOTING STAAAAAR!~\\n\r\nI feel that the soundtrack is easily the highlight of this show. I loved both OPs and both EDs and thought that every piece of the OST was used appropriately to enhance the intended mood. Each of the Four Maidens has her own theme that is played at the start of each battle and I thought that they were all catchy and a pleasure to hear. The songs \"Cross Over\" and \"Shining Star\" by 9nine were especially catchy and used as ED 1 and OP 2 respectively. It's a soundtrack that you will notice, but at the same time it doesn't detract from the scene it's supporting.\\n\r\nWith regards to sound effects and voice acting, both are superb. The sound effects during the battles are cool and fit nicely, and the voice actors all fit their roles spot-on. Miyano Mamoru did an especially good job as Takuto with his hilarious engrish and epic battle cries.  \\n\r\nOverall, the fact that I still listen to parts of the OST daily is a strong sign to me that this show has an outstanding sound. (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The general impression I had of the cast was that they were all unique and likable with very few exceptions. Furthermore, all of the cast feels very real and human. Takuto's inspiring and bright personality is well contrasted with Sugata's more stoic yet kind demeanor. What was especially impressive is the attention the show gives to properly fleshing-out minor characters. I've always been impressed with shows that can manage a large cast of characters well, and Star Driver is certainly one of them.\\n\r\nI can't be too analytical of the characters without spoiling plot developments, but what I will say is that each character's personality is unique and their interactions are interesting to observe. (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: My personal opinion is that the most important part of any show is how much I enjoyed it. Honestly, Star Driver is one of those shows that you just really enjoy without knowing particularly why. Maybe it was how awesome Takuto was as he skillfully defeated his foes? Maybe it was his ridiculous transformation sequence and catch phrases? Maybe it was the Glittering Crux Brigade and how fabulous they were? Or maybe it was all of it?\\n\r\nAs I've said before, I enjoyed the hell out of this show. It evoked excitement, put a smile on my face, and made me eager to watch more. (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nSo, overall, what do ratings mean anyway? Who cares about the plot holes? This is the kind of show that you should watch with a group of friends as you all get behind Takuto and his fabulous quest and do the KIRABOSHI!~ pose. Don't take it too seriously and enjoy the FABULOUS ride that is Star Driver. \\n\\n\r\nEnd note: Please keep in mind that my rating system isn't the same as everyone else's and what is a 9 for me might not be a 9 for you.",

            "content": "Kiraboshi!\r\nAn original mecha series from Bones, the same studio that brought us RahXephon and Eureka Seven, Star Driver is quite a bit different from your typical mecha fare. On the island of Southern Cross there is a mysterious masked organization known as Glittering Crux. Their mission is to discover the island's four seal maidens and shatter their seals. Each time they do so, they gain more power over the mysterious stone figures that lay in the mine that they use for their headquarters. With each seal that is broken the more power these \u201cCybodies\u201d have, until the final seal is broken, and they will beable to be unleashed upon the world.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately for Glittering Crux, the island has a newcomer, teenage boy Takuto Tsunashi. Takuto posses a Cybody of his own, the Tauburn. Each time Glittering Crux tries to unleash one of its Cybodies, which become usable in the mysterious dimension known as Zero-Time, Takuto is able transform into the \"Galactic Pretty Boy\" and wield the Tauburn, being perhaps the world's only way to stop Glittering Crux from accomplishing their plans. At the same time Takuto must maneuver a love triangle involving his friend Sugata Shindou and his fiance, Wako Agemaki, who is one of the island's maidens.\\n\\n\r\nStar Driver is a fairly interesting take at first on the mecha genre. It is written by Yoko Enokido, the same person who wrote the show Revolutionary Girl Utena. That show's influence on the style of this show is quite apparent. The show is neither your traditional super robot show nor the gritty real robot type of show that Gundam has made popular. Rather it is something completely different. Similar to a show like Code Geass, high school drama is a big part of the show; in fact to a level where you sometimes think the mecha battles are complete after thoughts. The mecha themselves are quite pretty (arguably the highlight of the show) and the storyline is structured that Takuto is only able to fight one Cybody at once, and it is quite complicated for them to be repaired, What this means is that we typically have a new mecha battle practically every episode. Both the design and the animation are fabulous, and the music just adds to it. If I was viewing this show purely on its visuals and styles, it would get a very high mark.\\n\\n\r\nWhen your main character proclaims himself a \"Galactic Pretty Boy\" you learn that you can't take things too seriously, and that's really the way to approach this show. It is a fun viewing, but usually not very thought provoking. Several aspects of the plot are quite laughable, most notably that nearly every single member of Takuto's school is a member of Glittering Crux but they often don't realize each other are members when it should be quite obvious. Other rather foolish aspects of the storyline include the perverted school nurse and one of Takuto's classmates being married to a wealthy senior citizen who lives thousands of miles away and doesn't speak the same language as her. The love triangle between Takuto, Sugata and Wako is also quite a focus although we do eventually add to it other dynamics from several angles to liven things up. \\n\\n\r\nWhere the show falters is that it becomes very formulaic at times. You generally know exactly how each episode is going to go; namely 12-15 minutes of character development, often focusing on a supporting character, a singing sequence (much like Utena) as Zero-Time appears and Takuto gets in the Tauburn (along with his pretty boy costume) and Takuto quickly defeating his opponent. Rince and repeat. The best episodes are those that completely eschew this formula. The show also has an overabundance of characters. Most notably, a pair of characters are introduced approximately 2/3 into the show, get a lot of focus, and end up being completely useless to the overall storyline. Trimming them as well as several others would have helped, especially as the show rushes its way through its conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nIf you can get over those faults though, there is a lot to like about this show and it provides a high level of entertainment and enjoyment.",

            "content": "Well, this will be my first review for this site! Okay, Star Driver....*sigh* First, let me start by saying that I, while enjoying it immensely, have really been slacking on my anime viewing as of the past few years. Star Driver is one of 2 anime I've finished since Kill la Kill ended back in early 2014, and one of only about 10 anime that I've finished in like 6 years.  This, most likely, severely impacted my enjoyment of this series...and man, did I enjoy this one!\r\nStory: \r\nThis is, without a doubt the weakest aspect of this series.  Is it terrible? No. Isit unique? Definitely not. Is it even engrossing in any way? Eh...sometimes...maybe...ish.  The main plot of the series centers around Tsunashi Takuto, a 15-year-old boy who washes up on an island one night and is discovered by fellow teenager Agemaki Wako and her childhood friend/somewhat-fiance Shindo Sugata.  We soon learn that Takuto is actually the legendary \"Ginga Bishounen\" (literally \"Galactic Pretty-Boy\"~) who is capable of summoning a giant mech suit (referred to as a Cybody in the series) named Tauburn. We follow Takuto, Wako and Sugata as they try and prevent \"Clich\u00e9d Evil Organization #1,987,208\" (actually called \"Kiraboshi: Order of the Cross/Glittering Crux Brigade\") from using other Cybodies and the powers of islands' four Shirine Maidens for their own dark purposes. Most episodes follow a somewhat \"monster of the week\" formula which can get dull after a while.  And, of course, there is typical high-school life and the required love triangle of the three mains to deal with when we're taking a break from the real plot.  The story is nothing groundbreaking, can sometimes be seen as less than coherent and most of the time is just a convoluted mess. It's still entertaining in it's own right and I didn't find it painful to sit through. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nFor the most part, the art-style of this anime isn't really anything to write home about. However, when it truly needs to shine, it does so with fantastic results! The animation of each and every \"Zero-Time\" mech battle is simply gorgeous, with the sheer epicness leaving me in a state of \"@)___(@\" 90% of the time. There is a lot of repeated animation but I was never bored watching them play out over and over again. It was just that fun to watch. Shame that most of the fight scenes were under 3 minutes in length; this is one of the areas where the series really shines. On the other hand, the character designs are a strange combination of both flashy and bland.  It's the weirdest thing: sometimes they're distinctive and interesting (such is the case with characters like Takuto, his seductive...and married...classmate, Mrs. Kanako Watanabe and a few others) and sometimes they leave something to be desired (Wako, Sugata and about 80% of the supporting cast).  \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThis is easily my absolute favorite aspect of this series. I. Love. This. Soundtrack.  It's gorgeous, full of epic orchestral pieces and  beautiful character tracks (courtesy of the Shrine Maidens).  In fact, the Northern Shrine Maiden provides me with one of my favorite anime tracks of all-time, \"Monochrome\" (the T.V. version, in particular).  This series does not shirk in the music department. When I can actually remember the tune of the opening and ending themes, I am instantly impressed. And as for the voices, Star Driver is crammed full of familiar talent that is known to deliver. Fukuyama Jun(Lelouch) = Sugata, Miyano Mamoru(Rintarou/Light) = Takuto, Hayami Saori (\"Tsuruko\"/Ikaros) = Wako.  Other famous seiyuu include Tomatsu Haruka (\"Anaru\"), Yukana (C.C./everything), Ishida Akira (Gaara/everything else) among many others. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nHere's where we get shaky again. While the characters are all well-established and easily distinguishable from one another there is little to no development, especially concerning our three main protagonists.  They are essentially the same from start to finish. \\n\\n\r\n     Takuto is the perpetually happy lead with the gravity defying hair.  He attracts pretty much every female he makes eye-contact with, is pretty much good at anything and everything and is just a super nice guy. You've seen this character 3,000 times and you're gonna see it 3,000 more times. The kid's just...perfect. He will figure a way out of any situation, no matter how a**-pull-ish the solution seems. He doesn't have any further potential to reach as a character because by the start of the series he's already reached it. I don't hate him as a main character, but compelling? Nah...\\n\\n\r\n     Sugata is another one you've seen time and time again. The beautiful, dark-haired, quiet type. He sometimes seems to have a chip on his shoulder, but is generally friendly. I wouldn't classify him as \"the stoic\" but he isn't far from it. He comes complete with angst, family issues, secrets, dark prophecies and other miscellaneous baggage. Somehow, with all this going on, he's even less interesting than Takuto.  Oh, and he's also a harem-magnet, of course. \\n\\n\r\n     And Wako...oh, Wako. She's pretty cute...she...um...eats a lot...she's...nice...and she's.....well....yeah. That's pretty much it. She is the least realized character in this series and that's saying something. Her relevance to the plot revolves around her being one of the only 2 known Shrine Maidens at the start of the series (not a spoiler, I promise) and being the main focus of the underlying rivalry between, otherwise best friends, Takuto and Sugata.  She's the female lead, but it really just feels like she's there without needing to be. She does stuff, especially near the end, but it feels like \"too little, too late\" by that point. She's a decently attractive, bland girl with an undeserved male-following and little else to offer. One good thing is that, while she does occasionally fill this role, she isn't always playing the part of \"damsel in distress\". \\n\\n\r\n     As for the supporting cast... I like them! I like them all a lot! There is a large cast of supporting characters and all of them are a blast to follow. This, along with the musical score and Cybody battles are the primary reason I stuck with this series til the end and plan to watch the movie. From the above mentioned Mrs. Kanako Watanabe to the teen-bishounen loving school nurse to the only girl who can out-positive Takuto (Yo Mizuno) to the creepy anarchistic maybe-lesbians Kei and Ko, I got a ton of laughs from these characters. And they, along with the host of other interesting supporting characters, pretty much provide the best drama for the series. If an episode is uncharacteristically deep and intriguing, it's probably starring one of these guys or gals.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nI must admit, even with all of its aforementioned flaws, I am very glad I chose to watch this anime. It was essentially just on a whim that I picked the series but I had a blast!  It was just that fun to watch. Stupid fun, but fun nonetheless.  Like I said before, this is only the second anime I've seen to completion in over a year and I desperately missed the medium; since this series is basically and amalgamation of the most stereotypical anime-y things imaginable, my judgement could have been clouded by a sense of nostalgia and fondness!\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nStar Driver: Kagayaki no Takuto will most likely not be the best anime you have ever seen or ever will see.  It's got a fairly weak story carried on the backs of a fairly standard main trio. However, there are a ton of great side characters to keep you distracted from how confused the main plot has you. The animation at times is just breathtaking (especially during those \"Zero-Time\" battles). And the soundtrack is both beautiful and epic. If you're looking for a deep story that will leave you pondering the meaning of existence, you ain't gettin' it here. If you're looking to come home from work or school and kick back with a plethora of funny bishounen and bishoujo, get drowned in enough fanservice to make both sexes happy and occasionally have your mind blown by what you're seeing and hearing, then check out this series. You could do much worse.",

            "content": "Star Driver is... an interesting experience. It's a formulaic \"villain of the week\" mech show, but also a very ambitious and unique one. Though it definitely had a set pattern to it, it tried to go somewhere different within that pattern. I went into the show expecting to be indifferent towards it, but that's not the effect I got. Star Driver is at the very least worth a glance; here's why.\r\nStory - 7/10\r\nThe story is pretty good. It's ambitious and certainly quirky. It starts off strong and gets weak nearer to the end, but the ending makes up for it. Admittedly, Star Driver's story hasdefinite flaws. In many instances, the viewer is left to figure things out on their own. We're never really told why many of the events in the show are happening, or even why they matter. As I said, it follows a \"villain of the week\" format; each week, the protagonist fights a new enemy and beats them (with a few episodes not fitting this pattern). The show is reminiscent of Revolutionary Girl Utena in this aspect. Many of the episodes have their own side plot, usually relating to the enemy for that week. We get a lot of info we don't need, but not a lot that we do. Even in the end there are a resounding number of questions left unanswered. If bones wanted to, they could probably make a season two. They don't need to, as the ending is a very good example of an ending that makes up for the flaws in a series.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10/10\\n\r\nThe characters are drawn in a very fluid (if not anorexic) manner. The show's animation never looks bad. What stands out are the mech fights. The battles are GORGEOUS. No two ways about it. Part of me thinks that Star Driver was just made so that bones could show off their skill in the field of animation. If that's the case, well played. All the fights are a definite treat to watch. The mech designs are reminiscent of Mamoru Nagano's work (Five Star Stories, Heavy Metal L Gaim) and they ARE out there.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7/10\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is pretty nice and fits the general mood of the show. The insert songs playing during the battles is a very nice touch. The openings and endings are fine. Nothing too noteworthy, though check out the insert song \"Monochrome\". It's fantastic.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 7/10\\n\r\nWhile Star Driver has issues with its story, character development is handled rather nicely in this show. If anything, it focuses so much on character development that it neglects the story. We know why each of the characters are motivated, from protagonist to antagonist. Though at first it leaves us in suspense, we gradually learn about each of the important characters, maybe more than we needed to. Still, there's a bit left out, likely for suspense. THAT BEING SAID; the cousins arc is one of the most pointless things ever. Why? This arc has characters that were literally brought in, given no backstory, and filled up space. This is the best example of bad character development in this show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9/10\\n\r\nGINGA! BISHOUNEN! Star Driver is indeed a fun watch; it's humorous, intense, and witty. The fights are great and the jokes are pretty funny. For all its flaws I was anxious each week for what the next episode would have. Personally, I love Star Driver for what it is. Is it a masterpiece? No, but it's certainly a fun shonen series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8/10\\n\r\nAveraging all previous factors, the score is a decent 8, mostly due to enjoyment. It's hardly the best show in recent years (that would be Madoka Magica), but it's definitely an enjoyable one. Even with all it's problems I'd still recommend it as an enjoyable shonen mech series. Light to decent 8.",

            "content": "Well how should I begin this\u2026\r\nIt\u2019s kind of hard to write a review for this anime and to that I\u2019ve never done it before. You can\u2019t put one animation into simple words everyone understands without spoiling anything but at the same time rate what\u2019s actually happened in the series. \r\nThis time to put it frankly, my expectations were too high. I always loved Utena and I always will, this'll never change. I already knew that Star Driver would probably not be able to play in the same league as Utena, because there are just 25 Episodes and Utena still sparkles with 52 + 1 OVA.\\n\r\nMaybe Star Driver would have gotten there somehow but as it is now it feels kind of loose and unfinished. Now for the reason why I think so, I beg your pardon, but this will take a while. ^^\u2019\u2019\\n\\n\\n\r\nIntroduction: \\n\\n\r\nIn the first Episode some girl named Wako, a Miko and a guy named Sugata were introduced, both seem to share a connection, he wanted to do something to protect her, something that would seemingly cost his very own life. Wako on the other hand did not even want to think about that fact, she begged him not to. \\n\r\nIt really felt like there was something bigger behind this, not just a bond they were sharing, something in Sugata must have trigger that feeling to do the ultimate sacrifice. \\n\r\nThen someone gets washed ashore, an unconscious boy, red hair, red shirt, white trousers. Wako who seemingly is a lovely and caring person rushes to the boy, because she sensed something near them. Quickly applied first aid saves the boy from death and we get introduced to Takuto the  next day in the Animation. \\n\r\nSugata, Wako and Takuto quickly become friends, and most of the time in the animation you\u2019ll here why. \u201cBecause he can put a smile to everyone\u2019s face\u201d. \\n\r\nAn organization named Kiraboshi is introduced as well or as the subs call them, \u201cglittering crux\u201d, seemingly evil, dark clothing, masks. An organization where no one knows who the other person is, they even have a special greeting, which is still nice and cool after I watched the 25 Episodes. Anyway, they explain that they are here because they want to bring there Cybodies to the outer World. \\n\\n\r\nCybodies are machines or rather mind and motion controlled metallic Golems, each of them has a different ability. Other than in Gundam a Cybody is directly linked with the human mind and soul, if the Cybody gets hit, driver inside will be hurt as well. Glittering crux wants to use those giant metallic things to change the world and/ or be the strongest military might. But there\u2019s a catch, they are only able to ride one within something called \u201cZero Time\u201d.\\n\r\nThe Mikos/Maidens of this island (the only one who\u2019s known from the start is Wako) keep this \u201cZero Time\u201d intact, so that no Cybody is able to enter the outside world. So Kiraboshi has to destroy every Maidens Seal to set their war machines free.\\n\r\nThat\u2019s a nice reason, everythings good, we learn that Wako and Sugata are engaged, we have some evil plot mostly about changing/ revolutionizing the world or destroying it, but sadly this is where things start to fall apart.\\n\\n\r\nMajor problems:\\n\\n\r\nTakuto, the hero of the series and Sugata seem to be the only interesting guys on the whole island, so everyone female (even the members of Kiraboshi,) is interested in either Sugata OR Takuto. There are lots of episodes where interesting character development is abandoned in favor of mindless swooning. But that is not the main problem. \\n\r\nEvil guys are not evil or rather never were from the start, some interesting parts and story strings are quickly tossed aside with some halfhearted explanations through either Takuto or the guy called \u201cHead\u201d. \\n\r\nThe head/captain of the theatrical club is the only really mysterious person including the pet \"vice\" Fukuboncho from the start, but after Episode 23, after she said something that really stirred something in me, she is never seen again, as are many other good characters.\\n\\n\r\nTakuto on the other hand, who\u2019s always in the spotlight, has to fight one or sometimes more members of the evil Crux organization. I will not say why, or explain everything because this is basically a spoiler which will turn out to be the main reason for the story to progress, if you can even call it a story.\\n\r\nSo the red haired boy, who only got here to this Island to \u201csearch for his father and to live out his youth\u201d ends up in fighting with his own cybody, which he inherited from his grandfather, to protect the Mikos/Maidens of this Island. And every Member of the Crux seems to fall prey to his \u201cTauburn\u201d with simply ONE Attack. \\n\r\nEven though the boy stated his grandfather did not teach him anything about Tauburn, he is able to come up with every attack the robot can do in an instant. If he\u2019s in a pinch, fear not after 3 or 4 Episodes it is rather clear how this Animation will progress. \\n\r\nThose \u201cfights\u201d are not really impressive or surprising, no matter how strong the opposing Cybody seems, Takuto has, in the end, by no means any problem in defeating the thread before him with one single attack. \\n\r\nThis is the basic flaw this animation has, and it sadly will drain your patience and your liking to Takuto very quickly (except you are into that stuff ofcourse). \\n\\n\r\nThroughout the series are many things which you will never recieve a proper answer to and it is much like the storywriter is saying \u201cWell it\u2019s like that, live with it\u201d to everyone who has actually watched it.\\n\r\nThe Ending of Star Driver \u201cKagayake no Takuto\u201d will leave you at awe, not because it is intensely good or bad, but because it feels like you just started it. There was not much progress throughout the series and you could explain everything in Star Driver with just 3 to 4 sentences.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack and voice acting:\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was great, as always, the watcher is immediately able to feel something from the characters, they are funny when they have to be, sad, angry or secretive. They did a really good job, the best they could to put more feeling into everyone. Sometimes it\u2019s a bit over dramatized but that\u2019s okay, it\u2019s an animation, better that, than nothing. It was great to hear and see the emotions from the characters from the beginning to the end and the charactersongs really warmed my heart.\\n\\n\r\nThe Soundtrack itself was good, really good, there are a few songs, especially the songs of the maidens which will never be erased from my MP3 player. Sadly those where only distributed through the Blu-Ray limited Edition in Japan. Monochrome alone was so beautiful, soothing and powerful at the same time that I want to see the first ten episodes just because of that one character (Sakana-sama) and her specific song. If you have the chance to buy it, do so, you will probably never regret it. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation: \\n\\n\r\nThe Animation of StarDriver was rather well made, it was nothing epic, some poses and expressions appeared to be a bit clumsy, but that\u2019s okay, Anime would not be such fun if it was perfect. Everything looked like it should, there were no harsh differences like in some other animations (Angel Beats for example). Sometimes the Cybodies would get another dark inked shadowing or rather gloss effect, and sometimes not, which is sad, because it looked really nice in the last episode. The clothing of every character was nice, the movements were not overdone, and the movement sequences were okay as well. \\n\r\nThe \u201cfights\u201d seemed to be flashy and well done at first but the animation lost a bit of its charm because of the story progression and pattern. No matter how good a Crux Cybody including how threatening all attacks looked Takuto would ultimately turn it into a scrapheap with one measly hit, nothing more would it take to make it explode like all others before. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall I\u2019d state the following, if you are too bored by my writing or do not have anough time to read through it.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s not that Star driver doesn\u2019t try to be good, it\u2019s fun to watch, but overall it fails to deliver a plot that will keep you going and it even fails to satisfy the viewer in the end. If you expect nothing more than a fun animation, without deep conspiracies or really good and believable villains or reasons to fight, than this is your animation. Likeable, heart-warming characters and a really good OST with some very memorable tracks make it worth watching, but they will not make a few basic mistakes, like major plot holes or the lack of excitement in battle disappear in thin air. It's a fun to watch animation but still nothing you want to keep for years to come.\\n\\n\r\nTo put it bluntly, if they want to explain everything, there will definitely be a season 2 or a movie which ties in. If not this will be my final review for the series. \\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading.",

Star Driver had extremely well done art, music, and plot to go with the mecha action. It went above and beyond my expectations and is now one of my favourite anime of all time. Most of the characters were a bit bland, but a few of them were quite intriguing, and the character designs were fairly nice. Definitely something for shonen lovers to see, but also a great series for a casual viewer to watch.",

Now that I've completed it, I can officially say... what the hell? =(\r\nWhere this anime loses points for me is all through the STORY... and that's pretty important.\r\nA lot of the episodes were spent doing nothing, when there was a lot to be done and a lot of unknowns to explore. I appreciated the karaoke with Keito (best scene EVER!) and the overall comedy, but I think that the writers could have tried a little harder instead of leaving a million loose ends. Don't get me wrong,I enjoyed the quirks they explored with each of the students, but felt that things could have moved a bit faster.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending was unsatisfying to me, personally, because I like to settle everything.

            "content": "(This is a spoiler-free review adapted for this site)\r\n[Synopsis]: After swimming from the mainland, Takuto Tsunashi (Miyano, Mamoru) washes ashore on the Southern Cross Isle. After being revived and cared for by Wako Agemaki (Hayami, Saori) and Sugata Shindou (Fukuyama, Jun) Takuto decides to enroll at the local high school where he meets other students but all the while a mysterious organization has set its plans into motion on the island. The Glittering Crux Brigade, utilizing robot-like technology called \u2018Cybodies\u2019 which can only be piloted in a dimension called Zero Time, attempt to break the seals of the island\u2019s designated maidens in order to loosetheir technology on the rest of the world. As a Galactic Pretty Boy, it is up to Takuto and his own cybody Tauburn to thwart them and their leader \u2018Head\u2019 (Ishida, Akira).\\n\\n\r\n[Characters]:\\n\\n\r\nThere actually isn\u2019t too much to say about the shows protagonist, Takuto Tsunashi. He\u2019s not quite carefree but does exhibit a cheerful demeanor, especially around his friends and becomes serious enough when he needs to be. His cheeriness aside, Takuto doesn\u2019t really have much to his name and without the aid of the famously eccentric Miyano Mamoru \u2013 would be a highly forgettable character as he lacks complexity even at a basic level. His desires are straightforward and he does not act proactively within the show so its hard to see if there is anything less than obvious going on beneath the surface with him. It is hard to characterize or describe Takuto outside of his enthusiasm which presents a problem for the show which he must act as the main character in.\\n\\n\r\nWako, the island\u2019s southern maiden, is the one who finds Takuto unconscious on the beachhead and resuscitates him. She is engaged to Sugata however as the show quickly reveals \u2013 this arrangement holds about as much gravity to it as if they were distant neighbors. The reason this is bothersome is because Wako promptly finds herself in a love triangle between Takuto and Sugata as she is attracted to both of them \u2013 so why her marriage arrangement even exists in the first place is a bit of a conundrum. Wako herself is fairly simplistic like Takuto in that the only things of note within the show are her love interests and her identity as a maiden for this makes her a target of the Glittering Crux Brigade.\\n\\n\r\nOf the three main characters, Sugata is the most calm and emotionally reserved. Despite being engaged to Wako he doesn't seem to mind her and Takuto hitting it off or even going on dates however he does appear to care deeply for Wako and subsequently Takuto who he befriends quickly after his arrival. While he is protective of Wako he is unable to do much when Takuto battles with the Glittering Crux Brigade in Zero Time which forces him into a position of inaction \u2013 Not the most exciting character trait.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, because the Glittering Crux Brigade and the school which Takuto attends have so many different members and students respectively, a great deal of the cast is given plenty of screen time. While they do not necessarily make up for the rather plain main cast of characters, they are greatly varied and provide a good measure of entertainment as they interact with each other and the protagonists \u2013 they display good individuality and at times can be the most interesting thing in the episode.\\n\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]:\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation is quite good with consistent detail throughout the 25 episodes. While there are no notable drops in quality, the approach to animation sometimes changed depending on the scene. Action scenes featuring the cybodies would sometimes take on a harsher level of shading and the frame rate might lower a by a few however the technique worked well for the action sequences and was even reminiscent of Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann at times.\\n\\n\r\nTakuto\u2019s design is quite vibrant, primarily when he is in his transformed / piloting state of the \u2018Galactic Pretty Boy. The Glittering Crux Brigade sport crude and revealing outfits which, while matching well with each other, do not really have anything tying them theme-wise to the show or setting itself.\\n\\n\r\n[Story]:\\n\\n\r\nThe story has a good deal going on inside of it but not everything is immediately relevant to the primary plot \u2013 which is fine. Some of the more interesting character interactions and exchanges happen independently of the Glittering Crux Brigade\u2019s episodic attempts to break the maiden\u2019s seals and fulfill their goal.\\n\\n\r\nThe show starts in a \u201cfight an episode\u201d style formula however stays true to that form with only small variations for what I would consider far too long a time. With near comedic timing, the main cast will be enjoying themselves, the Crux Brigade will interrupt by initiating Zero Time by way of their Cybodies, Takuto and Tauburn defend Wako and defeat the enemy at hand, the day resumes. While there are other subplots and characters at play in the show alongside this conflict, the monotony of the presentation is quite memorable. Which brings me to my next point:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this show, for lack of a better phrase, are unrealistically stupid. Firstly, the members of the Glittering Crux Brigade, while expressing disdain for Takuto each time they are defeated and scheming on the sidelines all the while, never feel like they are truly trying to accomplish their objective. They wish for nothing more than to best Tauburn in Zero Time and break Wako\u2019s maiden seal however their diversity of strategy is severely lacking among other things. The true problem with this is that the show gives specific insight into how dumb the characters are being. If they fail to defeat Takuto, why not send in multiple cybody pilots at once to defeat him you ask? Perhaps it because they can\u2019t due to the rules of Zero Time\u2026 however this is not the case \u2013 they are perfectly capable of fighting in pairs as well as trios and so whatever reason that exists as to why they cannot all team up on him at once is completely lost to me. Furthermore, while one cybody will differ from the next in design and sometimes weapons, the strategies the drivers employ are almost always \u2018attack head on and brute force a victory\u2019. The fights themselves are quite nice and well choreographed but upon realizing what the Brigade should be capable of on paper, their actions are extremely underwhelming.\\n\\n\r\nTo capstone this last point concerning the unintelligent behavior of the characters \u2013 Takuto himself is quite frustrating in this regard. Despite the fact that he knows the Brigade is after Wako, he never takes steps to further protect her other then when he fights on her behalf in Zero Time. He is entirely aware of the danger to her on the island however at no point in the entire series does he do any more than wait for the next day to arrive before he is again launched into Zero Time to fight. He knows where the enemy\u2019s headquarters is after episode one but fails to take advantage of this information in any way. It is this stagnation of action that further cripples him as a character for me.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, the show at times boasts what I would describe as \u2018false depth. Over the course of the first few episodes we are told a story by the Northern maiden and later in the show are presented with a stage production of a related story. These scenes by themselves are actually quite good and are of my more favorite moments of the show however it is in their near-allegorical nature that they become problematic. The stories these scenes detail are at times quite referential to the plot of the show itself however these parallels don\u2019t always make direct sense and sometimes could refer to multiple things within the plot. It is this lack of a decisive or clear feeling that cheapens what could have been very interesting story telling.\\n\\n\r\n[Music]:\\n\\n\r\nThe music was what I thought was one of the more positive points of the show. Each maiden is attributed one song and these songs often play in correspondence with their character arcs. These songs usually show up come Zero Time and because there is a decent variety of them on top of the orchestral score \u2013 I think they keep what could be very monotonous and repetitive transformation sequences quite fresh and fun.\\n\\n\r\nThe score outside of these maiden songs is not as impressive to me as a listener however the orchestral themes go quite well with the mecha action of the show and lends itself well to the dramatic points of the show as well.\\n\\n\r\n[Final Thoughts and Rating]: \\n\\n\r\nThe show is fun however has actively negative elements that impair it\u2019s presentation overall. There are a great number of things, like Takuto\u2019s outlandish title of Galactic Pretty Boy and the Glittering Crux Brigade\u2019s outfit designs that might suggest the show is attempting to parody something however I saw no conclusive evidence on this note and therein I felt the crudeness of these things worked against what I would have thought was supposed to be a serious show outside of the school happenings and romantic exchanges.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 5\\n\\n\r\nI gave the show a 5 because it failed in many aspects to become memorable to me. The primary cast lacked characterization and the side characters, while interesting, were put to such frustrating use within the plot of the show that they themselves became disappointing as well. The show doesn't quite answer all of the questions I wish it did and this is fine in some regards however there are few a spoiler-related questions that could have been given room for explanation that would have markedly improved the show\u2019s plot. You will likely reach the end of the show and have a decent number of your questions answered however probably not the ones that you will have wanted to be explored.\\n\\n\r\n[Recommendations]:\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend Star Driver to people who enjoy the more hand-to-hand style of combat mecha as well as those who enjoy the episodic fight presentation as the major bulk of the show is spent in this way. The show doesn't sport much in the way of comedy but viewers who enjoy large casts of characters, each with their own thoughts and motivations, will be entertained by Star Driver however may be disappointed by the way in which the show utilizes these otherwise interesting characters.",

            "content": "Star Driver: Kagayaki no Takuto is one of those animes that you watch not for story content, but for fun.  What Star Driver lacks in story and characters, it makes up for in music and enjoyment.\r\nStory (7/10):\r\nThe story revolves around your stereotypical shonen character Takuto and his relationship with the surrounding characters, mainly Sugata and Wako.  Star Driver follows the main shonen theme of \"I will protect you\" and the story does a good job sticking to this theme.  Thrown in there are the other classic themes of love, troubled childhoods, and save the world, to name a few.  These otherthemes are not fully exploited, probably due to the fact that there's so many and not enough episodes, but I think if this became a 50 episode anime, they'd be able to exploit these themes in the way that they wanted to.  \\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10):\\n\\n\r\nThe art is controversial.  It follows the same lines of Lelouch of the Rebellion and CLAMP to some extent, with the bodies all being vertically stretched and big eyes, but somehow this manages to fit the anime.  If you can get over that, the rest of the animation is pretty good, my only complaint is the amount of reused clips, sure it saves on budget, but it should have done what other transforming animes do, like Sailor Moon, Pretear, etc by showing you the full transformation a couple of times, then just do a fast forward.  We don't need to see Tauburn stepping through Zero time every episode, it has no significance to the anime, and actually, you never really find out why that mecha does that and not the others but you can put clues together.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10):\\n\\n\r\nOk, the first OP was horrible, I could never sit through it, but the second OP was much better and fit the shonen type anime a lot better.  I never watched the ED so I can't critique those.  The reason why I rated the sound so high is due to the Maidens' songs, sure, the first time you hear some of them (West Maiden's Innocent Blue) it might be a little high pitched, but it grows on you, just like all of them.  The best has to be Northern Maiden's Monochrome, I highly recommend that to be added to anyone's playlist.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (7/10):\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Star Driver are very cliche, with Takuto representing your \"I can find happiness anywhere\" (I hate to say this, but another Naruto), Sugata representing your darker character with a lot of unwanted responsibility (almost like Sasuke, but definitely not as moody), and Wako representing your stereotypical shojo character, with multiple love interests and a hungry stomach.  These are the main characters, but you can definitely draw connections from the characters in this anime, to others (Mrs. Watanabe= Rangikou from Bleach for example).  So, the characters don't really stick out, and as you can see, I can't even remember their full names.  There really is no character development so to speak of, the only one being Mizuno and she's not even around for the full series.  Everyone else stays in their stereotyped roles and never budge from them, no resolutions are made.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10):\\n\\n\r\nI had been trying to find a good anime for a while and Star Driver didn't fail me.  I was skeptical at first due to the character designs and other recommendations, but the first episode got me hooked.  You just have to laugh at everything, I mean, having your superhero type being called \"Galactic Pretty Boy\"?  You know that's thrown in there just to make fun of bishies, and they do play around with that, especially with all the silly, stereotypical poses.  Warning, this anime's main focus is not on the fight scenes, so don't expect much from them because they'll always be a let down (except for the last episode, that wasn't that bad).  I guess the thing to keep in mind are all the quirks throughout the anime, some of them are pretty good and I know you'll enjoy it as much as I did.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10):\\n\\n\r\nI just averaged all my other scores and came out with an 8, but I think I would give this anime a 9.  It really wasn't bad if you're not expecting a deep story, but something light and funny.  The animation was consistent and actually pretty good, if you can get over the stretched style (which is good for making fun of bishie characters).  Overall, just sit back and relax and enjoy the comedy.",

            "content": "This Ginga Bishounen really spiced up my days during its times.\r\nTo be frank, I kinda contemplated watching this show because the promotional picture of the series had lots of girls flaunting over the only-two guys there, and my preferences-wise, I'd prefer a non-harem show (all-girls and all-boys alike) with loads of action, adventure with that sprinkle of lovely romance (shounen anime, to be exact). And Star Driver is just that.\r\nIt's funny, now that I think back. The element that kinda made me continue watching this anime was because of the Galactic Pretty Boy transformation. Takuto is just so swag, it takes a real man toshake that pretty ass like how he did! XD\\n\\n\r\nOk, veering off topic. Anyway, similar to any of BONES' original series, the story flies off automatically. Translation: it just means that the main character ALREADY knows what he's doing and everyone knows what their doing. Typical shounen animes would start off with a clueless boy who stumbled upon something magical..then POOF!!! \"THY POWER LIES WITHIN THEE AND THY IS THE CHOSEN ONE FOR...\" ...ya-daa ya-daa. But this series just slams the main plot concept in your face! First episode was like a \"Huh? What?\" because there's the protagonist whom everyone addresses as The Galactic Pretty Boy, characters who are high schoolers working underground as masked freaks and, if you're the type who is so familiar with the mecha designs from Gundam stories, lemme tell ya, Star Driver's mechas...have high heels.\\n\\n\r\nThis series depends on its first episode. The first episode is the one that either breaks or makes this anime. I've seen alot of critiques going, \"ARE YOU KIDDING ME? WHAT A TACKY NAME TO CALL SOMEONE GALACTIC PRETTY BOY\", and boy, it gets worst. And the story? Ambiguous starting, yes indeed. But further into the episodes when it goes into repeat mode (every episode, school-time -> zero time -> battle time -> new bad guy comes out!!! -> saves the day (or the girl) -> returns back to time -> all smiles), you'll get used to what powers that are adapting to and how they operate.\\n\\n\r\nNow this repeat mode, it's kinda frustrating sometimes. There are times when the protagonist does a brand new power to a battle that was difficult to win, and i'm here like \"urmm, excuse me, when did you learn that power? and why didnt you just use that for your other previous battles? it would have been SOO much easier!\"\\n\\n\r\nBut things take a great turn of events once the second season kicks in, and the real plot gets serious and surprising.\\n\\n\r\nThat's when this series gets the attraction and praises of many, because this is the essence of the anime that viewers are waiting to see. I'd rather not peer into spoilers here, but it's a worthwhile ride and this show really fits the quote \"Expect The Unexpected\". The ending is just spectacular as well! :D\\n\\n\r\nThough if you're the type who needs to know in how the characters know about the history of their mechas or how the 'evil' organisation was created or how the characters know of their powers or how the characters even get their powers to ensure that you feel complete satisfaction for the story, then my take is..don't watch this.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime will end with that note. I'm the type who willingly accepts that this ending is a result from this cut-off plot that BONES is delivering.\\n\\n\r\nFor the art, it's simply amazing! This show practically uses every single colour available in the world! It's seriously full of rainbows! Character designs are wonderful, and vaguely describes what kind of character they are which is good because not everyone is what they seem. There's a good variation to the characters, and all of them are just beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nThe music in the background fits very well with whatever happening on the scene, and I must say that the maidens' songs are definitely something that many will look forward to. The music has that tension vibe that brings chills to your spine and it has that space-galactic-star-trek feel to it too.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this show was, well in the words of the ginga bishounen, very fabulous. It's original indeed, with the unique hand motions, gestures and names. It certainly stands out among the rest as something outstanding. And after watching the entire series, you'd come to realise that the repeat mode episodes, unlike some animes, dwells greatly on character development and not just on the power-ups. The characters interact splendidly and the story never fails to give insights on everyone to ensure that the viewers are given their own judgement to determine if the characters are bad or good.\\n\\n\r\nSo if decimal points exist, I'd give it a 9.5 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nFav male character: Tsunashi Takuto\\n\r\nFav female character: Mizuno Yo",

There has only been one time I've done this, and it was with Durarara! and I was correct in my assumption then, as I can only assume I will be again.\r\nIf you liked Revolutionary Girl Utena, this review is not for you. You will LOVE this show. Star Driver is almost exactly like Utena but with mecha. If you found Utena to be sub par and not worth the hype, continue reading, this review will make complete sense to you. \r\nI may or may not retract this review uponseries completion, take it at your own risk!\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\\n\r\nBones. Bones. Bones. Bones. Bones! In this category you have never ever failed to disappoint me, it why most of my favorite shows are made by you and why I continue watching things you make again and again! Alas, if this show could survive on your art alone all would be well and good with the world! There are some lazy points and it is not as beautiful as some of the other Bones' shows I've seen, but it has a fluidity and brightness that I absolutely adore. If nothing else, the art is why I am still watching this show and why I'm reviewing it first... since it is honestly the high point of this review. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\\n\r\nLet's roll on down~ I happen to be a fan of the music for this show. It's very lovely and usually apt and fitting per the scene. I even enjoyed hearing the Shrine Maiden's songs per episode (the only repetitive thing I liked.) Was it top notch blow me out of the water Eureka Seven class? No. Was it lovely? Yes. Lovely and average, sadly, but lovely all the same.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3\\n\\n\r\nStory? What story? Oh you mean the thing they put there to pretend something is happening? Nah, they don't have one of those. Seriously? No I'm telling you, it simply does not exist. This show is slow as balls. A snail could beat this story in a race. I am on episode 12 and so far... we had a bunch of uneventful battles, little to NO reveal about the CRAZY things they've introduced as norm (a fox for the Vice President of the 'Drama Club', and the purpose of Cybodies to begin with.) Halfway through the show with NOTHING to go on? If this were an hour long program, I'd have left at the half hour break! If they are going to reveal anything at all, at this point, it is going to be rushed/half assed/nonexistent. That's very sad. It makes me think of Ponyo. Endless potential, all worthless. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4\\n\\n\r\nFlat. Flat. FLAT! Since when did Bones write such two dimensional stereotypes?? The weak damsel in distress. The quiet boy who feels powerless but is more powerful than anyone. So on and so forth... waste of my time. Insert lots of complaints about the boring characters here. Move along.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4\\n\\n\r\nI'm bored of the show and I'm bored of reviewing it. The only thing propelling me from episode to episode is the hope it'll get better... I let that carry me through Utena, I don't know if I'll make it through this series which is half the size of that one. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5\\n\\n\r\nStar Driver is a show that tries very hard (too hard) to be serious without taking itself seriously. In short, it fails heavily and falls flat on almost every turn.\\n\\n\r\nSorry Ginga Bishounen, you're just lukewarm to me!",

            "content": "Star Driver is yet another Studio Bones show that started out with promise, but then ended up losing traction and leaves you with one of the biggest disappointments in anime history. The first few episodes of Star Driver are charming, though episodic, and are reminiscent of something like Revolutionary Girl Utena, where there\u2019s a mysterious group of students that secretly battle each other after hours. \r\n\t\u2022 In the case of Star Driver, it\u2019s more of the case of when time is halted, they pilot mecha in a way that looks arcane and archaic, like the guymelefs in Escaflowne), which I thought was fascinating. Inwardly, Iwas thinking, \u201cThey could do so much with this premise and the character selection,\u201d but does anyone expect Studio Bones to deliver\u2026 probably not.\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 I kept praying that this series would be the ONE fucking exception, and that it wouldn\u2019t fall through like a pen on wet paper, but it did! The plot leads somewhere that seems like it was written in five minutes. Like they had spent all thought on how they wanted things to LOOK rather than having a cohesive plot.\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 A character gets put on a boat and sent away with little to no explanation (probably because they could not even begin to afford Haruka Tomatsu; she\u2019s known for voicing Asuna in Sword Art Online and many other pretty girl characters), and the romances grow convoluted and confusing and you\u2019re left to wonder whether being way too fucking obtuse or it\u2019s just poor writing. Knowing Bones, just poor writing.  \\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 The music, character designs, and animation were definitely there, but a direction was not. The series makes itself seem FAR more contentious than it actually is. The ending had a lame reveal and an anti-climatic fight that tries to elevate its depth by taking the final battle TO SPACE.\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 Many thought that this series was a comedy or a parody, since there were over-the-top operatic presentations in the plot, such a the protagonist being referred to as the Ginga Bishounen a.k.a. Galactic Pretty Boy, and the student council members dressing in dominatrix attire. But, the show takes itself far too seriously for any of that; in fact it\u2019s hard to place a particular tone on this series.\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 Overall, it could have been handled much better. The visual direction, as I said earlier is very pretty. Takuya Igurashi, the director of Soul Eater and Ouran High School Host Club, did it. If you want something that will eventually let you down, but starts out as an incredible ride \u2026 then Star Driver is something you might want to check out. Especially if you like such series as: Revolutionary Girl Utena, Melody of Oblivion, and Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann. Otherwise, no. It\u2019s a failed auteur piece and I rate it a 5/10.",

I don't know how some people gave this anime a high rating but I guess every person got his/her own taste. But for me, this anime just below my expectations. Usually, I do a simple check on any anime that I want to watch like reading the synopsis and the character background or so. When I read the info about this anime, I was like \" seems cool wow \". But then, all drain out on the first episode. This anime doesn't have that \"wow\"vibe on it. I only watch up until 6th episode but I just fast forward everything cause I feel like I know how each episode will go on. It's predictable. I do feel like \" this is nice \" at some point but not too much. I re watched Gundam Seed anime for i don't know how many times already but that anime still give me that \" wow \" factor and I don't feel much coming from Star Driver. What a bump. Well, I don't know what to say about the story line, character build up, relation or so on since I just watch a few episode. For those who want to watch this, feel free to watch it but  I wouldn't recommend this. \\n\\n\r\nP/S: This is my first review aha..

            "content": "This is my first review blah blah blah...\r\nKiraboshi!!\r\nStar Driver: Kagayaki no Takuto is a story about a bunch of high school kids with crazy colored hair fighting fighting each other with giant robots. Takuto, the fearless red leader fights the evil circus show called the Glittering Crux to stop them from taking over the world and ruining the Island Maidens lives. Using his super overpowered, unbeatable mecha (and support from his theater club friends) he fights a different reject Crux member every week; defeating them in glorious bishounen fashion. Despite its obvious story flaws I found comfort in the \"monster of the week\" approach thatthe series took. It reminded me of a super steroid filled version of power rangers. \\n\\n\r\nStory 8\\n\r\nAs I've stated the story is slightly repetitive and the first time I watched the series I found the it hard to follow. It leaves many unanswered questions until the very end. However the answers to these questions are somewhat surprising and create good character development. I'm not a huge fan of the ending to this anime, because it seems to reach a resolution so fast and because it is pretty predictable. I did enjoy much of the show's humor when it was there and the show's serious side was never too melodramatic.  There are a few anime cliches and some yaoi fanservice, which is kind of a turn off, but for the most part the plot flows fairly well and creates an interesting story. \\n\\n\r\nArt 9\\n\r\nI really liked the art in this series. Everything from character design to backgrounds was amazing. The action sequences were also very well done and flowed smoothly. Emotions and body language are also portrayed well. I especially liked the use of color and tone to set the mood for a scene. \\n\\n\r\nSound 9\\n\r\nOpenings and Endings for Star Driver are great. Gravity 0 by Aqua Timez is a great song and it went great with the animation. There are also 4 in-show songs sung by the Maidens. These are normally sung preceding an epic mecha fight and serve to set the mood. I really enjoyed all four Maiden songs and thought they were a great addition to the anime. The voice acting is also very well done though there are some pretty ridiculous sounding voices, particularly in the Glittering Crux.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9\\n\r\nThe characters of Star Driver aren't particularly unique. There's the main character that all the girls love. He's outgoing and you can't help but like him. Then there's the female lead who's super happy and beloved by all. The villains start out as typical bad guys, out to rule with world using their giant robots. However, the anime does a wonderful job of fleshing out many of the villains by showing their everyday lives and motivations. My favorite character by far is Shindo Sugata. He's the main character's friend and a super badass... watch the anime and you'll agree with me, he's a beast.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10\\n\r\nStar Driver is show that sucks you in. Not with its story but with everything else it does. The first time i watched it was for the two minutes of epic mecha fight every episode. The second time was for the story. And guess what? It was great both times. I would recommend this anime to pretty much anyone. It has something for everyone and it's wonderful show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9",

            "content": "Star Driver is a show that is more entertaining than it has any right to be. In 2010, scriptwriter Yoji Enokido embarked on a new journey in familiar territory. In Star Driver, the influences of shows that Enokido previously worked on, such as Ouran Highschool Host Club, Revolutionary Girl Utena, Sailor Moon, and even Evangelion, are are bright as day. The final product is a show that crosses existing boundaries in strange ways, the end result being something between a mecha anime for girls and a magical girl anime for boys.\r\nAs expected of Enokido, the story of Star Driver is one that can be appreciatedon multiple levels. At its most basic level, Star Driver is about a teenage boy, Takuto Tsunashi, with an infectiously positive personality who ventures to an island off the coast of Japan in order to find his father. On this island, Takuto, who reveals himself to be \u201cthe Galactic Pretty Boy,\u201d finds himself caught in a series of mecha (or Cybody, as they're known as in the show) battles that take place in an alternate dimension, known as Zero Time, against other teenagers, who make up a group known as the Glittering Crux, with the purpose being to protect, or destroy, the Cybodies of the island\u2019s shrine maidens, which upon their destruction would allow Cybodies to be used in the real world. The series tends to follow an episodic \u201cvillain of the day\u201d format. Some viewers may dislike the episodic nature of the series, but it's this structure that allows us to know the cast much better, and the moments that break the formula become all the more impactful for it. Although the Glittering Crux are our antagonists, they aren't evil, just high school students struggling with growing up in their own ways. On top of that, the focus of Star Driver isn't the Cybody battles, which are as beautiful as they are brief, just like how Utena wasn\u2019t about sword fighting duels, it's the high school students that pilot them and the inherent struggles of youth, with close attention paid to the phenomena of love. Like in Utena, everyday life segments that make up Star Driver vary in tone; some are as flamboyant and satisfyingly-ridiculous as those you would see in Ouran, while others take a dramatic turn. Ingrained in the story is the conflict of being born and raised on a small, isolated island; in such a setting. Character struggle to determine whether they have a duty to follow tradition or are free to follow their aspirations. On another, deeper, level, the story is about the experience of trios. Many characters of the cast make up their own respective trios of friends, and one of the most subtle but engaging aspects of Star Driver is observing how these trios differ. The dynamics and personalities in these groups cause them to experience different struggles, and seeing how they overcome the conflicts that arise as a result of their relationships is one of the most engaging parts of the series. The characters of Star Driver tend to be fairly well-written, although some are expanded upon more than others. The show has a very large cast, so some members of the ensemble are more-or-less deemed insignificant compared to their peers. Star Driver isn\u2019t perfect. At times, the story and lore can be confusing, there is a fair amount of terminology, although it isn\u2019t overwhelming by any means, and some things you may think are important the plot or lore of the series are ignored. The ensemble cast may have been too large. But at the end of the day, Star Driver\u2019s story is still comprehensible and the flaws don\u2019t detract significantly from the experience.\\n\\n\r\nThe designs are great throughout the series. The designs of the characters are as vibrant as their personalities. The characters of Star Driver are birthed from a diverse color palette, and it\u2019s interesting how the colors swap to fit the setting, such as the bright colors during school-life scenes or the darker purples during Glittering Crux scenes. The costumes of the Glittering Crux in particular are pretty cool. When it comes to mecha anime, however, the designs of the mecha are vital. In this regard, Star Driver is quite unique. Some viewers may be put off by the slender frame of most of the Cybodies, which differ heavily from those found in Gundam. However, I found the designs very refreshing and visually-appealing. That\u2019s not to say there are some weird costumes and Cybodies, but they\u2019re easy to overlook given how strong the other designs are, and if anything, they not-as-good ones will make you laugh (like the torso-sections of the costumes of a certain duo that appear in the later half of the series).\\n\\n\r\nStar Driver is produced by Bones, so it's not a surprise that the animation is well above what you would expect from most anime. The animation is generally very good. Lines are clean and movement is fluid. Cybody fights in particular are beautifully animated, even if they are short. Because of the show\u2019s episodic nature, animation does get reused. Typically, before a Cybody fight begins, the viewer will see about 50 seconds of the same footage in which the \u201cvillain of the day\u201d enters their Cybody and Zero Time opens. During part of this sequence is some noticeable CG, but it isn\u2019t there for very long and the anime is generally pretty free from the intrusion of noticeable computer-generated animation outside of some effects to make Zero Time more unearthly. Also, even though this sequence is formulaic, it is nonetheless exciting, as the different pilots will change the sequence slightly, and throughout the series these sequences are accompanied by great music with vocals. The animation for some of Takuto\u2019s attacks also gets reused, as well as the sequence in which Tauburn, the name of Takuto\u2019s Cybody, enters Zero Time, as well as that in which he transforms into the Galactic Pretty Boy, although they are animated so beautifully I can\u2019t fault them for getting their mileage out of these sequences. I never got tired of them, but their status as recycled is noticeable to any observer.\\n\\n\r\nSound is a category in which Star Driver excels, whether you are speaking about the voice acting or music. Miyano Mamoru does a fantastic job as Takuto, but it doesn't stop there. The most important members of the cast are also voiced by talented individuals. The soundtrack for the series is also great. Each of the 4 maidens has their own song which they sing throughout the series. The songs do a good job of hyping up the viewer for the battle that immediately follows. The non-vocal background in the series is also quite good. Not every song is memorable, but they never detract from the experience and convey the tone and atmosphere of the scenes they accompany very well; they blend in very well. Star Driver also has fantastic opening and ending sequences. The songs chosen do a good job of enhancing the animated scenes they accompany, particularly the openings which are fantastic. The great opening sequences really embody the energetic and youthful nature of Star Driver.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, Star Driver is entertaining and engaging because of how these different components come together. It isn't a perfect show, and some may be turned off entirely from decisions like the episodic formula, reused animation, or Enokido\u2019s writing style, but for others, Star Driver will be a show that will resonate with their souls just as strong as masterpieces like the Tatami Galaxy because the elements may combine in a way that turns out to be exactly what the viewer wants from an anime, as it did for myself. \\n",

            "content": "If you are looking for good action with plot , You will like this series. As for romance, This series is really unfair.\r\nStory 5/10 : I would have given 10 if romance was satisfying but it's sooo unfair . Story starts with a girl saved our hero by giving CPR xD i won't spoil but story is really good , you will be surprised with character's connection.\r\nArt  and character 9/10 : Art is Great , I just have to say, Tauburn is the most pimping mecha in the history of ever. All the  Cybodys have very vivid and special qualities, making them differentto each other. All with very good color schemes, and unique designs. The characters are pretty well done. And when each star driver  \" Apprivoise \" they show off with their style is shown really cool  , despite the fact that main hero's body is a bit off with T-shirt  :P.Well characters are young and  are a bit more proportioned. \\n\\n\\n\r\nsound 10/10 : Voice acting, opening theme song, ending theme song, background music, sound effects and a special song that plays whenever they fight.... It suits the anime perfectly. There's really not much to say here. No complaints whatsoever. 10.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNote : I  want everyone in this world to watch this series. Specially those who like romance more then action. I won't spoil anything  but those who really like romance must watch this series. \" Please \" \\n",
