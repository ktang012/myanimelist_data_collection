            "content": "I don't usually watch the romantic comedy genre of things. I always enjoyed action, fantasy, adventure like Soul Eater, Cowboy Bebop, Trigun etc. but for some reason I was in the mood for something different. \r\nToradora is just the 3rd romcom anime series i watched and I can truly say that it has become my FAVORITE anime.\r\nThe short version of this review is: I very much enjoyed Toradora\r\n-The characters are all unique, likable, and relatable due to the fact they all display their weak sides sometimes and moments of insecurity behind the personality exterior. The chemistry between the characters was fun to watch\r\n-The story staysaway from cliches and was relatively unpredictable for a love story. Every character had a reason and motive for what they did and how they acted, other than just being unnaturally dumb/too prideful/stubborn.\\n\\n\r\n-The soundtrack was really good, making certain scenes all the more memorable\\n\\n\r\n-I loved the comedic scenarios in the beginning of the series, which gets progressively more serious and emotional as we get deeper into the story and characters, but the overall vibe of the show stays relatively consistent to the end\\n\\n\r\n-I became emotionally invested in the overall plot and characters and couldn't stop watching, which is extremely rare for me, especially for this genre\\n\\n\r\nOverall:10/10\\n\\n\r\n----\\n\\n\r\nI watched the 1st episode and was interested. After the 2nd ep, I was hooked. I watched all 25 episodes in one go, back to back, because I couldn't stop. Never has another series been able to keep me going (I usually don't watch more than 5 episodes in one sitting), but Toradora kept me wanting to click on the next episode each time until I was finished, and left wanting more (even though I was satisfied with the ending)\\n\\n\r\nAfterwards, I thought a lot about why an anime series of a genre that is usually not my taste could have been able to retain my attention for so long, and i realized the answers: the characters and the overall story.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are what make this series so great. Each character have personalities that are unique and rather realistic and believable (or as realistic as animes go). There is no \"super\" character that acts too good or too cool for school. There is no \"that annoying\" character that acts too snobby or stuck up, which can sometimes be a problem for tsundere characters. And this is all because every character shows a weak side or moments of insecurity, which makes each of them more relatable. It also allows for many rather comedic scenes as well as emotional moments. But the best part is the interactions and chemistry between all the characters, and the way each of them change as their relationship with each other grows.\\n\\n\r\nThe second thing is the story. The reason I usually don't care for romance or drama is because I usually find the story too cliche or predictable. I also hate those cliche moments of \"coincidence\", for example, when a main character happens to see his/her love interest with someone else accidentally and misunderstands. I also hate it when characters act unnaturally stupid or too prideful for no reason and let it get in the way of the relationship. \\n\\n\r\nBut none of those cliche moments happen in Toradora. Every character has a reason and motive for the actions they decide to take. The story managed to keep me guessing and wanting to know what will happen next, instead of making me feel like i could write the story myself.\\n\\n\r\nAnother plus for Toradora is the music. There are some key scenes where the soundtrack actually triggered goosebumps and made me tear; it still does even after rewatching. THAT IS RARE FOR ME. In fact i don't think anything I've ever watched, not just anime, can even make me feel that emotionally invested in fictional characters.\\n\\n\r\nAlmost forgot to mention that after it was done, I started to watch it again from the beginning the next day. Another rare occurrence for me, as usually i don't feel like rewatching things for months.  I was able to pick up certain things that i missed with the first watch thru. The only reason I put the story as 9/10 was because of this. A few plot points weren't really shown or conveyed in the best way and were missed even to an avid viewer like me. But I was glad to have felt that way, leaving me thinking about what I missed, instead of feeling like I could have easily figured it out or seen it coming. \\n\\n\r\nAgain, Toradora has become my favorite anime, as a guy that usually doesn't care for this genre, which says a lot. It gave me more enjoyment than any of the other anime I have seen so far. I would recommend it to anyone, not just romance lovers.",

Here's the explanation:\r\nI felt the sensation changed 4 times while watch this anime:\r\n1st time: During episodes 1 to 2, watching those episodes for the first time I thought this series would just be a light comedy anime which will make me chuckle without a  complicated story. It just like the spring season that give a high hopes on the early year.\r\n2nd time: During episodes 3 to 14, I'm getting a bit bored and almost drop it, but I decided to pushmy self to finish it (the only reasons I want to finish it is just because I got interest by the last main character who showed up in this part). It just like summer season that is really hot, and the only fun is going to beach during the summer break.\\n\\n\r\n3rd time: During episodes 15 to 24, my curiosity was piqued for what will be going on with this show, things got a bit complicated, and I think this part is the \"life\" of the series. Just like an autumn season, although the flowers fall, but becomes a wonderful scenery.\\n\\n\r\n4th time: During the final episode, \"WHAT THE HELL\", with this final episode, I mean everything seems fine at the beginning of the episode, but in the end it turned out anti-climatic for me. Just like the winter season, unpredictable storms, snow, and always cold; but after that Spring comes.\\n\\n\r\nWell, that's my personal view of the story, so I give 7/10 for it.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound, nothing particular to comment, it all seem good enough, and I like the second opening OST. 7/10 for both of it.\\n\\n\r\nAll characters were unique, both in design and personalities, even with the supporting characters, they are all really good. A great job was done by the creator at this point. EXCEPT for MC's pet, it's very annoying, and I really like \"Ami-n\", her appearance, her personality, her reactions, her way of pretending to be an adult (she's the last MC that I mentioned before), so 8/10 For Chara design.\\n\\n\r\nFor the enjoyment, I think I'll go for 7/10 that because this show had me feel bored once, and the ending was anti-climatic for me, but I do like the humor and story development (starting from episode 15).\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10 score for this show.",

            "content": "Moderator Edit: This review contains spoilers.\r\n-------------------\r\nToradora!= Another normal romance/drama anime involving high school...We had many anime of this kind. In fact, these type of anime are very common nowadays. I had watched this type many times, but mostly ended up so wrongly. \r\nBut this time, Toradora! is done the right way. Yup, I ended up loving this \"normal\" anime. Story involves two high-schoolers, a normal guy, and a short girl....Now where have I heard that from? Many anime had this kind of story. Yup, It kinda gives me feelings of Deja Vu-ness. This time its done the way I like it. On to the review....\r\nStory-Involves a ordinary guy named Ryuuji Takasu and a short and short-tempered girl named Aisaka Taiga. This reminds of Saito and Louise from the Zero no Tsukaima series. Where the protagonist always gets beaten up by the girl, yeah those type. And more strangely, most of these short anime girls are always so strong or feared by many..thats Taiga a.k.a Palmtop Tiger. While Ryuuji only looks scary, but in reality, he's pretty harmless. OK~ enough of that...Why only a 7 for the story? Its pretty common..and its very predictable. I knew Ryuuji would end up with Taiga even just by looking at the cover art without watching the anime!. So obvious, so predictable, which makes it a bit boring. This flaw is common in many romance/drama anime, but its quite annoying. Story have a very good pace but it took quite a while for both of the hero and heroine to fall in love. Yup, they fell in love...but it took so long! But that's a good thing right? haahha- well~ those are the flaws I found here. Story= 7 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nArt- Graphics are rather unusual but very good..which I would say, Graphics are unique, that's for sure. Good graphics should receive a good score!\\n\r\nArt= 9 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nSound-  The anime had 2 OP and 2 ED...1st OP was...strange. Same goes for the 1st ED. But the 2nd? Both the 2nd OP and ED are both awesome~. The 2nd OP tells  Ryuuji and Taiga's \"love\" arc is going to start. Don't get any wrong ideas. XD\\n\r\nSound= 9 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- All characters are uniquely made...Yup, especially Taiga and Minori. Minori had a very funny attitude which I loved. Awesome characters, awesome score.\\n\r\nCharacter= 10 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- I enjoyed every single episode there was, some were very memorable but few are forgettable. I personally, enjoyed every minute of the anime which included comedy, parodies, romance, and some parts were very sad. Sad, but not as sad as Ef- Tale of memories. Toradora! can make you have \"watery eyes\", but Ef probably can make you cry. Beyond Awesome enjoyment.\\n\r\nEnjoyment= 10 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall= Toradora! is not really recommended for everyone to watch, but Its highly recommended for fans of Romance/drama/comedy anime with a bit of sadness. If you bought it, its worth every penny. Anyone looking for some romance, then this could be your answer to that question. If you watch it online, its worth every minute and if you downloaded it, its worth every bits of data. \\n\r\nOVERALL= 10 out of 10. Really loved it.",

            "content": "Romance has always been a tricky, unforgiving genre; you make one mistake and the story slowly begins to crumble. Why is that? Well, as many of us may know, love is a complicated business. So is entertainment. So why do we watch romantic series? There's many different answers that vary based on the individual. Maybe we're simply taking a chance at trying to find a feeling. A feeling of the tingle of our heartstrings, or a stir in our human emotions. It's good to feel these things from time to time. Fortunately for us, Toradora is a series that gracefully grants us this chance. Itcaptivates us in remembering what a romance series should strive to be.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes Toradora so exceptional as far as the romance genre goes? Is it the story? The art? The Sound? The Characters? It just may be all of them combined. I'd like to begin by stating something. The story of Toradora is very predictable. Clich\u00e9 even. But wait, isn't that a bad thing? While the story may seem plain, the execution of the pacing is undeniably good at assuming a calm, relaxed flow for the majority of its run which, in turn, yields a satisfying romantic series as a result.\\n\\n\r\nToradora is not like many other romantic series out there that have characters fall in love simply just because. Love slowly stems from what begins as two people who become friends looking for mutual assistance in their romantic interests. Toradora gives its audience room to breathe and focuses the first half of the show on building the friendship between the two main characters through silly, lighthearted antics, making developed romantic feelings between characters seem more realistic and sincere later down the line when things become more serious. However, love is a complicated business, as I've said in my introduction. People's feelings do get walked over and left in the dust. While it's thematically a good thing for the audience to feel touched emotionally, seeing characters getting their emotions crushed was truly a somber sight to behold.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was smooth and was enjoyable visually. I did like the consistency that Toradora\u2019s animation offered. For a series that was done in the 2008-2009 time period, it still looks marvelous and holds its own compared to more recent anime. The sound was a big plus in my book. While I liked both the OPs and EDs, I have to give a big shout out to the timing of the music during dramatic moments; that repetitive melody of piano left quite a strong impression on me. I'd like to also address that the script and voice actors were really quite something. The dark little subtleties in comments or remarks were an admirable feature the show had to offer.\\n\\n\r\nI think every romantic series heavily depends on its cast to be the foundation of the series, holding the structure of the show into place. The characters of Toradora are an interesting bunch that create the opportunity for its audience to laugh and also feel gloomy. There is more than meets the eye underneath these seemingly clich\u00e9 characters. Ryuuji is the male lead and he is generally a very likable, realistic character. He struggles with romance, gets low self-esteem because he\u2019s self-conscious, and regularly voices his opinions on matters at hand. Throughout the show he proves that he\u2019s a loyal friend and all around good guy, though he might be a little obsessive compulsive about cleanliness and order. But hey, who doesn't have their own little quirks?\\n\\n\r\nMoving onto the main female lead, I felt a little wishy-washy in regards to liking Taiga\u2019s character. I\u2019m not a fan of the tsundere type, and that\u2019s exactly what she is. While Taiga acts like a brat most of the time, she also becomes more and more endearing as the series progresses. She stands up for herself and her friends, and despite her childish behavior, generally cares for the people around her. With the main two characters out of the way, what about the other \u2018main\u2019 characters: Minori, Yuusaku, and Ami?\\n\\n\r\nOne of Toradora\u2019s strengths was allowing the supporting characters to have their moments in the spotlight. Because of this, we are able to obtain a deeper understanding of them and paint a better picture of them as characters. While Ami and Minori seem perceptive of the relationships in the group, I\u2019m honestly not sure about Yuusaku. Under his oblivious fa\u00e7ade it\u2019s somewhat difficult to tell. While he's Ryuuji's best friend, he is oddly quite different compared to him. Yuusaku is energetic, outgoing, responsible, yet also very silly and childish. Minori seems like genuinely a nice girl with the happy on the outside clich\u00e9 personality, but Minori is really a coward underneath it all; she doesn\u2019t confront her own emotions and constantly pushes for Taiga\u2019s happiness at her own expense. It\u2019s not that I disliked Minori as a character, it was just agitating to watch her at times. Last but not least, Kawashima, Ami. Ami is the most astute of the unsaid troubles that are bothering the people in the group and often makes subtle comments or sarcastic remarks pertaining to their unspoken feelings. When she is first introduced she seems extremely stuck up and vain, but as the series progressed it becomes more apparent that she\u2019s tactfully looking out for the people she can finally call \u2018friends\u2019 for the first time. She developed the most out of the three supporting main characters, in my opinion, and easily became one of my favorite characters of the series, if not my most favorite.\\n\\n\r\nDespite how gratifying I thought the series was, I also can\u2019t turn a blind eye on the aspects of the show that I did not like. One of the most annoying tropes in anime, at least for me, is characters getting hit for no reason, or very petty ones. It's a trope that comes hand-in-hand with the tsundere character archetype, and it's one of the reasons I dislike tsundere characters as a whole. Taiga, who basically goes down the list of tsundere character traits like a check list, is a huge offender of verbally and physically abusing Ryuuji early on in the series. If you're like me, you'll find this to be quite vexing. Lastly, fan service is apparent in nearly every recent anime. While I personally dislike fan service, I know that many series utilize it to keep a portion of their audience interested. I watched Toradora because it was a romance story that set itself apart from most others. Although it's substantially toned down, comparatively to other series, I believe Toradora would have been better off not utilizing any fan service at all.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I did like the ending overall because it ties things up nicely, and felt fairly rewarding, I did not like how the ending felt very rushed. The amount of material crammed into the last couple episodes felt considerably off, considering the rest of the show was focused on coaxing the relationships at a much slower pace. A couple bad apples on a tree don\u2019t make the rest of the apples rotten, and Toradora was far from being bad. It isn\u2019t a completely perfect series, but one of the best the romance genre has to offer in anime so far.\\n\\n\r\nEvery once in a while a person can't help but wonder what if. There has been a time in all our lives when we have pondered the thought of meeting the 'one' who is exactly right for us. Every day we strive to find a person, or people, who understand and accept us for who we are. Maybe, just maybe, you\u2019ll find that one person that fits together with you like two consecutive cogs in an intricate machine. Maybe, if you were lucky, you might meet someone who is exactly right for you. It's not because this person is perfect, or because you are, but because your combined flaws fit together seamlessly in a way that allows two different beings to coexist together perfectly as equals \u2026 something like a Tiger and a Dragon.",

            "content": "Toradora! is one of the most annoying shows I have ever watched. And it has the single most ridiculous  ending of all anime I've seen. Even the ending of Claymore was more satisfying, which is saying something.\r\nIt is naturally that annoying because initially it seems to have much quality. I liked animation, music, opening, and, most importantly, I really liked most of the characters, including Taiga and Ryuuji. It is definitely quite clich\u00e9 but charming brainless high-school romance with engaging characters isn't something I automatically hate. \r\nBut, as episodes go by, all of the shows' cons start to become visible. First of all -it is too long relative to its content. Generally I'm ready to forgive Japanese for being so inept at confessing emotions, but my tolerance is limited and after over ten episodes fueled only by \"omg, I'm so Japanese, I just can't spit it out\" I'm totally fed up. Then around episode 11th Toradora experiences massive tone-shift and evolves into a soap opera without any significant comedy element. It wouldn't be a problem, but honestly it's not a very good soap opera - the dilemmas and problems seem forced for the sake of drama and easily solvable, had characters sit down and talked. As a result the entire middle part of the show feels completely unnecessary and contributes little to the main plot.\\n\\n\r\nBut still it is not tragically bad and these unnecessary middle parts may be fun for someone who likes Slice of Life genre. The real problems begin when the series after much overblown melodrama finally establishes official couple. There are many people who didn't like the pairing and preferred the other ones. For me the problem was not the pairing (because I personally preferred it over the others) but the way it was dealt with - I got the strong impression that the story on an emotional level actually justifies these other relationships better (even although I didn't like them). The final confession ends up being forced onto the couple, not only by the writers who want to rush the end, but by the other characters in-universe as well. As a result final romantic couple is not very romantic - at least one side of that pairing was literally dragged into it by external circumstances. And when one puts into consideration the fact that this forced side had all the chance to act on its own will few episodes before, yet it chose to pass, one begins to wonder what the writers had on their minds.\\n\\n\r\nStill, I wouldn't dislike the show that much. But the very last arc also turns Toradora!, already an over-exalted soap-opera, into a full-blown Bollywood movie. The only difference between the two is that Toradora manages to have even more unnecessary stupid drama than its Indian counterparts.  Characters start to behave completely at random, clearly with a goal to create as much drama as possible, without any other reason. The viewers are presented with a runaway couple (which ran away for no reason whatsoever), hasty engagement (without even sharing a single kiss beforehand), missing fathers, a few family reconciliations and the girl leaving a boy without a single a word for an extended period of time (again without a good reason). All of these serious events are introduced over the span of one and a half episode and resolved almost immediately. That was so unbelievably contrived, idiotic and poorly handled it was painful to watch. And it was absolutely not romantic. At all.\\n\\n\r\nThere is something seriously wrong with romantic comedy that manages to be ultimately neither romantic nor funny. That combined with the unbearable forced melodrama and the clumsy treatment of last six episodes sinked this show so much, I can't rate it any higher.",

Put me in the clutches of a diabolical serial killer/torturer, and I have no idea what I\u2019d do. Ryuji, our hero, is one of a kind. Bards should sing about him in taverns all across Tamriel. For 14 episodes, he stands Taiga\u2019s relentless abuse with a smile.\r\nIn one of the greatest songs ever written, the extremely white lead singer of the Smiths sings about how it\u2019s so easy to laugh and so easy to hate. Kindness and gentleness are difficult, andI do agree with him. That said, I wonder if the band and their fanbase would change their mind if they saw the anime. Actually, considering how huge this anime is, becoming iconic in the school genre \u2013 I think they won\u2019t.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m a defender of the school genre. Many rant about how immature and derivative it is, but few people didn\u2019t go to school. A lot of things happen in school and you meet a lot of people, so it\u2019s a place rife for stories. Its low-key and stable environment actually makes it excellent for stories driven by characters. Conflicts will have to rise from within and not an external UFO coming to wreck the party. These shows rely heavily on their characters, and it\u2019s enough to have a decent, odd cast \u2013 see Haganai \u2013 to make something decent. Toradora is a major failure because of how insufferable its cast is.\\n\\n\r\nSince we\u2019re talking about symbols and not actual human beings, I need to find a way to explain why and how disgusted I was with them and how that lead me to conclude this anime is horrid crap. Many a great story are about horrible people. In fact, one of the best novels ever is about such a terrible murder. It\u2019s their darkness, their psychology and reasons for being so that makes them so intriguing. How frightening these characters are because we understand them and see us in them. Part of our obsession with villains and their backstories, or with serial killers\u2019 childhoods is because we want to know why they\u2019re like this.\\n\\n\r\nEveryone in Toradora is a bit of an asshole. Actually, only two characters are but they\u2019re so dominant that it\u2019s easy to forget about the rest. Taiga is the big problem, since she\u2019s both the main character and the worst. Tsunderes can often seem creepy, sometimes borderline Gacy-like sadistic. None of them are as bad as Taiga.\\n\\n\r\nThe archetype can be funny. Tsunderes\u2019 appeal is their insecurity, how they address the Presentation of Self in Everyday Life \u2013 we put up a front in every social interaction, putting a different front in different places. The best Tsundere, Neptunia\u2018s Noire is all about this. Humor never comes from her being violent \u2013 she\u2019s rarely is \u2013 but how hard she works on her image.\\n\\n\r\nIn contrast, Taiga is nothing but violence. She reacts to everything with violence, like a 10-year-old playing Elder Scrolls and thinking that it\u2019s supercool to kill every NPC. She may not kill anyone, let alone essential NPC\u2019s but it doesn\u2019t make it any less creepy. In every episode, she beats up people at least 5 times. Her reactions are always with force, causing clear pain to the other characters. I\u2019d expect anyone to beat her in return the first time.\\n\\n\r\nThe fact Ryuji stays there is flat-out creepy. Moreover, she treats him with pure condescension. Rarely, if ever, she addresses him in a way that\u2019s not hostile. Early in the series they make a pact to help each other, but Taiga doesn\u2019t actually help him until the middle of the series. All the episodes are about the characters doing stuff and Taiga beating people up. The anime never answers why, exactly, Ryuji puts up with so much physical abuse.\\n\\n\r\nYes, \u2018abuse\u2019 is the only word that can describes their relationship. Switch the sexes. Imagine if Ryuji was constantly beating up Taiga, calling her \u2018bitch\u2019 and so forth. It\u2019s nothing but sick. You can only watch it for so long before getting tired of this torture porn thing. Not only Taiga is violent to everyone, she also has a weird entitlement problem. She expects Ryuji to take care of her and do everything for her. She never asks, demands with the expectations that Ryuji must do it for her.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, she\u2019s nothing but a horrible person who beats up everyone but also thinks everyone owes her everything. Now, a character being a terrible human being isn\u2019t enough. How their actions are framed is important and now we get to the main problem. Taiga is framed as okay.\\n\\n\r\nA backstory occasionally rears its head, feelings of insecurity do show themselves. None of is it actually dark, none of it gives us a glimpse into a troubled psych that can only react with violence and cannot connect to people. The backstory may justify anger, but the anime never acknowledge how bad Taiga\u2019s case is. No one around her also reacts like they should. They treat her like she\u2019s a quirky friend, someone who occasionally goes off, like that friend who swears a lot. This is a person who\u2019s in desperate need of help and a lawyer. It\u2019s no longer a person having anger issues but a criminal that everyone tolerates because the plot demands it.\\n\\n\r\nSuch light framing of dark material is unforgivable. Humor doesn\u2019t have anything to do with it, but how the frame never addresses the darkness of it. Physical abuse leaves people with trauma. People react harshly to physical abuse. If people stay for a long time with a physical person, being nice to them and doing what they want it means they got issues of their own. I can\u2019t stress how dark this material is, yet the light framing is disrespectful to anyone who went through physical abuse.\\n\\n\r\nTaiga and the framing of her behavior towers over the anime, so everything else ends up pointless. No matter how hard they try, the creators frame Taiga as quirky and cute. Nothing can salvage the anime, but then again it doesn\u2019t seem they try. There isn\u2019t much in the way of stories or characters. Ryuji is like that dude from Haganai only not as hot. Somehow he manages to be perfect and eventually the center of the harem because he\u2019s nice to everyone and doesn\u2019t have wants of his own. To the anime\u2019s credit, the secondary male actually has a purpose here and he\u2019s a bit hot, but besides being a more energetic nice guy there\u2019s nothing to him.\\n\\n\r\nOther females consist of a wacky redhead who\u2019s entertaining for five episodes and then becomes tiresome. As for Ami, she\u2019s another generic asshole who\u2019s overall unpleasant without the darkness. Like Taiga, she treats people like crap but the cruelty is never meant to shock or make us reflect. Funniest thing is how the anime passes her off as sexy. Not only the characters can\u2019t drive a story, but they look bad.\\n\\n\r\nArt style is another problem the anime suffers from. No one has a distinctive look. School anime, at worst, create pleasing to look at characters. You may not experience anything profound but there is aesthetic value in the designs, in understanding human beauty. Designs don\u2019t have to break boundaries, but little touches like Sena\u2019s butterfly and deep eye color make an anime more pleasing to look at.\\n\\n\r\nToradora does nothing like this. Taiga does have a weird hairstyle, but Minori isn\u2019t memorable at all. She has huge eyes and short red hair. End description. Worse offender is Ami who is meant to be the sex symbol. To express this, they gave her a longer hair and slightly bigger breasts. Unlike shows where the characters are actually sexy, her figure isn\u2019t defined or emphasized \u2013 which is necessary if the character\u2019s beauty is important to her personality. Her hair is just long without hairstyle quirks. Look at any anime that has a character whose beauty is important and you can always spot details expressing it \u2013 just as I described Sena in the above paragraph. The designers decided to do the bare minimum.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter designs are integral to how we view them. How people look is a part of them. It doesn\u2019t mean characters should all be sexy (that\u2019s actually quite odd) but their looks should somehow find their way to their personality. If your character is meant to be beautiful, make them beautiful. Toradora is satisfied with just sending the signals, mistaking low effort for minimalism. Minimalism is when you have few details but these details are important. Ami\u2019s design and everyone else\u2019s has no effort put into it. A simplicity that has no elegance, that emphasizes no details is just a product of no effort and laziness.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe the anime drastically improves. I have a hard time believing it. Watching this anime became painful. Witnessing the abuse Taiga inflicts on everyone, and expecting to be entertained and amused by it is too much. Torture porn at least acknowledges its characters suffer even if it expects me to find entertainment in pain. This anime pretends physical abuse doesn\u2019t cause any pain. Truly, it\u2019s objectionable almost on a moral standard.\\n\\n\r\n1 abusive partners out of 5",

            "content": "Mod Edit: This review may contain spoilers.\r\nStory: Secret love, unrequited love, love triangle... So yeah... The funny thing is that the ending is given away in the beginning. This can't even be considered spoilers to say that the main characters are going to end up together. Anybody who says otherwise is just too blind to realise this. Let's take the main points of the plot. First of all, one guy, one girl, each in love with each other's best friend. Two, those two try to support each other with their love interest. In order to do that, make them spend a lot of time together.Even make them live next to each other. Give them a social outcast aura and the result is: congratulations! you got yourself a very unoriginal couple. Now this is a shame because the idea is quite realistic, only too obvious which gives you no expectations. For all I know, Ryuuji and Taiga could hold hands, cuddle, hug, kiss, have sex, get married and act like there is some distance between. Awkward since there is absolutely none. From the beginning, they were already ridiculously close to each other by living next door but no, not close enough, need to live under the same roof. Even best friends don't do that ( yeah I know, room-mates or particular situation involving money but that wasn't one of them ) so it clearly gives you an idea of their relationship.\\n\\n\r\nArt: This part pisses me off, it is so bad. Taiga is supposed to be cute... it didn't do it for me.She looks like an underdeveloped child with a big head and permanent bed hair.  Maybe it's just me but the chara design really need some work. However Ryuuji's face gets +1. Now if I just say this without evidence to back up my argument, it's just trolling. If possible, watch the fight scene between Taiga and Sumire. To avoid spoilers, well, watch it on mute and no subs... The animation is really sloppy here, whether it's the lighting, the background characters with the same face or simply character motions. The art is good only when everything is still. Sloppy sloppy sloppy.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: Too bad I didn't pay much attention, but the openings and endings were nothing spectacular or catchy. When it comes to sound, I would say that music is more important than the voice acting since most of the time, the acting is flawless, it just comes to whether or not the seiyuu's voice is appropriate to the character. In Toradora, it's the usual. The usual being flawless performance. Now for the music, the comparison might be unfair but Toradora is nothing compared to say, Clannad. I chose Clannad because no matter the scene, sad, happy or epic, it's easy to remember the themes while Toradora produces music that you hear in elevators or supermarkets. Only one stands out: Lost my Pieces. But it's just one... Not enough.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Ami saves the show a little with Minori not far behind but Taiga... Damn she pisses me off! Ryuuji is not bad but too weak to be important.\\n\r\nAmi and Minori had good scenes, good chara development. I didn't give a shit about Kitamura because he is a creepy smiling guy. Ryuuji had some changes but nothing significant. Taiga on the other hand, just got more and more annoying. She's not even a tsundere, the dere part is inexistant and replaced by retard state, otherwise she's just a plain spoiled bitch who needs to be left alone. That does it, she gets a -2 for being so unlikeable. Past the physical appearance which I don't even like one bit, she has nothing left except her execrable personnality. Now one way to sum up this show is that the side characters are more interesting than the main characters. When I say main, I mean Ryuuji and Taiga. Kitamura, Minori and Ami are side characters to me. While watching the show, I realised that I had no interest in whatever happens to Ryuuji and Taiga cause they already act like a couple. The side characters however make you want to know more about them. Creepy smiling dude Kitamura has a good reason for being like this while double face Ami and oddball Minori are kinda left out towards the end after much chara development. Bad idea. My main concern is how people perceive Taiga. She does things that makes you want to slap her really f*cking hard and shout what the f*ck is wrong with you? yet she is still described as being cute, lovely etc... That girl seriously has anger issues and they can't be justified by people calling you palmtop tiger, that's retarded. She's so rude it's not even funny. Now this might be spoilers but it sums up pretty much why I think her personality is the worst. In one scene, she learns about her unrequited love confessing to a certain girl who for specific reasons refuses to give a proper answer. This is because she's going away soon so she can't say yes yet doesn't want to lie to herself by saying no. What should Taiga do in this case? Well, nothing. For the simple reason that it doesn't concern her. Still, she goes out of her way to beat the crap out of that girl while insulting her and forcing her to say she hates the guy. I was thinking \"WTF\" the whole time. What gives her the right to beat someone up just because that person is a coward when it comes to love? If we had to beat up every person who is a coward because of love, we're doomed. Besides she's also overreacting and goes as far as insulting and hitting people for no reason. With Ryuuji, they represent the epitome of shallow people. Both of them have a crush on someone who's really popular. The reason surely is because they treat them differently from the rest of the class. If that's not being shallow. Take one guy who's a social outcast. Now take a girl who's really popular, kind, funny, pretty and easy to talk to. This one guy would probably fall in love with that girl if she goes to talk to him because he's probably thinking \"she's so nice, she talks to me while the other bastards don't even look at me, maybe she cares about me\" without realising that maybe she's just nice and talks to everybody. This describes Ryuuji and Taiga perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I was really disappointed by Toradora. At first I thought it would have nice development with the introduction of Ami but I guess not. It was dull and slow. Once you feel like there's something going to happen just push the reset button because it has the same feeling. Got some funny scenes though. Unfortunately the show is barely realistic. You don't root for development of the relationship between the characters and their crush because there's no feeling, no background story. Things would've been simpler like this:\\n\r\nRyuuji: I like Minori.\\n\r\nTaiga: Oh... I see. I like Kitamura.\\n\r\nRyuuji: !!! What!? Ok. So...\\n\r\nBoth: Wanna hang out sometimes?",

            "content": "Going into Toradora, I wasn\u2019t really expecting too much from it. I thought it would be your standard school life love story we have all seen so many times before. But low and behold it came out to be surprisingly good, and has quickly become one of my favorite 2008 airing anime series.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nThe story revolves around Ryuuji and Tiaga, two ordinary students that end up working together in order to help one another end up with the ones they love. It stays pretty true to the \"love story\" formula. What makes this anime really good is the excellent pacing it takes with the story.In many \"school life\" anime we always end up watching filler style episodes, only to have the end of the series be the only thing good about it. Not so for Toradora however! It manages to keep the anticipation between the potential couples high, all along weaving together a pretty good in depth story that really shows the heart of the characters. A lot of times we have scenes that show the characters trying to get the words out to express their feelings, and others offer more side story scenarios-- which usually end up going in conjunction with a certain character\u2019s inner turmoil and struggle. Each episode flows nicely into the next, and you get some pretty clever comedy along the way. Now that is not to say that Toradora's story is without fault; not every episode is particularity interesting as others, towards the end the story tends to drag on a bit and feel somewhat rushed, and the characters start to get in a sort of \"pity party\" mood with their situations, which can get to be a bit of a downer at times. Still though, haven\u2019t all of us been there at one point in our lives, where we really want to say what is in our hearts, but end up holding back for risk of getting hurt? Or even worse, hurting another? Overall the story is filled with enough drama and guess work to keep the audience into it! Though it should be said that hardcore romance fans may be able to predict some of the twists and turns the plot takes. It does come close to becoming a bit of a harem anime, but just never quite reaches that category. The anticipation of \"who will end up with who?\" --is the stories strongest feature, and the ending doesn't disappoint!!\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nThe art really isn\u2019t anything too special. You get a nice mixture of bright colorful characters and environments. The characters are sharp and well animated with their facial expressions, but the backgrounds can look a bit washed out at times. And some of the action scenarios can be a bit on the stiff side. Again, the character\u2019s faces are what stood out for me the most with the art, you really feel like you can read them at times.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nLike the visuals, I wouldn\u2019t go on par to say that the music can be anything more than \"appropriate.\" You do get some pretty nifty opening and closing songs, and they change mid way through the series. The BG music was nothing--if not forgettable. Even while writing this I can\u2019t really think of a piece that stood out for me. What does make the soundtrack so good however, are the character voices! All of them were matched perfectly to a \"T, \" and I could not find a single voice actor to be out of place with their role. I especially enjoyed Taiga\u2019s voice. She has this tough girl tone and attitude, yet you can tell that deep down inside she really does care about those around her. Something that the viewer will indeed discover while making their way through the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\r\nDefinitely the heart of Toradora! While going through this anime I really felt that I started a \"virtual\" style bond with them. I actually cared about the problems they had, and wanted them to end up happy in the end. Towards the beginning, viewers may find a character or two that they either dislike or even despise. But trust me when I say this: \"stick with it!\" They end up evolving and have many twits to their persona! Taiga is really the one who stole the show for me, she has so many layers to her personality that it can be hard to figure out just what is going through her head at times. A character named Minorin can be drop dead funny when she wants to be, and Ryuuji is a great guy that is always there for his friends. The best compliment I can say about the cast? They act very human (ie: realistic), maybe a bit exaggerated at times, but mix the two together very well! Which can be hard to do in an anime. My only real knock against the characters was, since there are multiple romance skits going on, at times it felt like some of them were a bit too discreet with confessing to one another; which in turn can make the story slow paced at times. I almost felt like I wanted to jump inside my computer screen and yell: \"Oh just say it already!!!\" That aside, there really isn't much to complain about, great cast! \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nDespite some of the glitches in the storyline, I still never the less found myself totally drawn into the world of Toradora! It had more than enough to offer to keep me wanting more! The mixture of comedy, romance, suspense and tender moments--really drew me in!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nToradora makes us contemplate what is more important in life; love or friendship? This anime really turned out to be a great surprise for me. Sure its got some flaws and all. But this series has it where it really counts; character chemistry and development! If you are a fan of romance anime, complimented with a great cast of characters and funny anecdotes. Then I highly recommend giving Toradora a try! It may not do anything new with its romance formula, but it does indeed do it right!",

            "content": "Toradora isn't your story that only focuses on one thing.  Well, at least I don't think so.  It conveys so much meaning to everything that is going on in life.  It shows you that sometimes, even your most important wish, the with you want to come true the most, can sometimes not be reached.  But it also shows some examples of how people decide their path and move on forward. \r\nPlease bear with me.  This is only my third time reviewing.\r\nThe story was fantastic.  Even though there are only 24 episodes, which is actually plenty, the story was welldeveloped.  There are no complaints that I can think of right now.  For example, the person you thought you loved just because of the way they act wasn't the one you loved, then comes another person who is a match for you.  That is a good plot on it's own.  That connects to what is going on in the real world.  \\n\\n\r\nThe art...  Fantastic.  You could really tell they put a lot of effort into it.  From they're facial expression, even the walking, they put a lot of effort.  Then when the animation shifts to the parts where there is violence, the animation in that part was...  Wow.  That is all I could say.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was great.  Everything, the sound effects were timed well, and the sound tracks matched perfectly with the scenes.  Although for some reason, the first ending song didn't quite get along with me.    But the rest was great.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were really the perfect match with the story.  They're slow development in each episodes connects the viewer in the story that sometimes they might think that they are them.  \\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment...  I enjoyed it very much.  It's not like romance is my highest favorite genre, but I still like it.  Especially in this one.  Also the comedy, some actions, and others were also factors of the enjoyment it brought.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this show was really great.  I only wish something like this will come in the future.",

            "content": "NOTE: This Review will be Updated every 6 episodes\r\nToradora is a highly entertaining romantic comedy that successfully escapes the cliched harem tales that dominate the genre. Although it is somewhat let down by mediocre animation and music, the original premise and unforgettable dialogue make Toradora one of the best light hearted romances  of the season.\r\nStory: 8\r\nToradora is based primarily on the interplay of Takasu and Taiga. A nice guy who has a fearsome reputation due to his aggressive looks, who makes an unlikely pact with a volatile, but cute girl, to help each other succeed with their respective crushes. This premise quite refreshing, andunlike almost all anime within the genre, the male lead is not automatically the object of affection for half a dozen girls.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the pace of the story is somewhat erratic. There are frequent episodes that seem more `slice of life', with no significant plot development. This, however, is not as bad is it seems, given that the events that do happy in each chapter are often hilarious, and well watching on their own.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\\n\r\nToradora art is not bad... not particularly good. It just does not stand out. While Taiga has a very attractive character design, some supporting characters do look rather bland. The background themselves are also serviceable, but not particularly noteworthy. There's nothing particularly wrong with Toradora's looks, its certainly comparable to that of for example, True Tears or School days. It just doesn't feature that extra level of excellence featured in Clannad or Tale of Memories.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting for the characters are well done, and definitely fit their roles. However, the OP and ending themes are rather mediocre. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\\n\r\nToradora's main strength is the personality of its cast. Rarely is there a character as unique as Aisaka and Takasu. Their personalities are not only memorable, but also multi-dimensional. While Aisaka, for example, comes across as an arrogant and demanding girl, there are rare moments where her more timid side is briefly shown.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyament: 10\\n\\n\r\nToradora is a great anime to watch, and perfect for lifting you from a foul mood. It's both funny and touching, which makes it great for short study or work breaks.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n\r\nDespite its technical flaws, Toradora is an excellent example of what a light hearted romantic comedy should be like. Despite its rather exaggerated circumstances, it features an original storyline where the cast are more than just cliches.",

            "content": "Toradora can do one thing extremely well: comedy. The characters of Toradora are completely built for playing off each other well in comedic gags. That's why I really loved the first half of Toradora. It had some of the best school comedy scenes I've seen. \r\nHowever, at the half way point, after the Culture Festival, it seems that an invisible switch was flipped for the story, where instead of focusing on comedy, the drama would be more prevalent.\r\nNow, there have been many shows that have been able to mix comedy and drama, they even form the genre of \"dramedy\", Kodocha and Clannad to only nametwo. So I know that the two can be sucessfully spliced. In Toradora's case though, the result is jarring, as the humor seemingly disappears from the show to make room for chick fights, eavesdropping, confessions, and rejections.\\n\\n\r\nThe main problem in this transition form comedy to drama is the complete 180 degree turn some of these characters do. Since they were built for comedy, the author/director needed to change them for the drama.\\n\\n\r\nMinorin is a wonderful example. She's super hyperactive and boisterous during the first half of the series. However, by the second half, when the show makes its transformation from comedy to drama, Minorin is just a shell of her character from just a few episodes prior. She broods, mopes, and loses pretty much all of her energy.\\n\\n\r\nHow am I supposed to take this story seriously when it seems like there are two different versions of the characters? I just cannot.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the boring statistical review.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10 - The first half was great because, while it included several school cliches, it found a way to be different from all its predecessors. The second half, however, was just cliche, and often convoluted, where it seemed the author just made characters fight with each other for no reason.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10 - The artwork is above average, which seems to be what J.C. Staff strives for. It's not near the level of JC's other series of the Fall, Toaru Majutsu no Index, but it definitely suffices and detail is provided when necessary. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10 - I'm a fan of the first opening/ending, but the second set are adequate as well. The BGM is unobtrusive and largely unnoticeable, but that's not really a bad thing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10 - As I said, these characters are built for comedy. Be it Ryuuji's near-OCD behavior when he happens upon a messy area or Taiga's childish demeanor whenever she sees Kitamura. They're funny. It's too bad that the characters were nearly all completely changed for the second half.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10 -  I loved the comedy in the first half, but dreaded the poor writing and inconsistency of the characters that plagued the second half. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10 - Overall, it's not bad. It's an average romantic comedy in a sea of romantic comedies.",

            "content": "Fairly enjoyable but not really cutting edge.\r\nOverall - 6/10\r\nI personally found Toradora to be somewhat enjoyable to watch but not exactly outstanding.  My biggest gripe was the use of Kugimiya Rie, coupled with J.C.Staff being the producer, which really dampened the potential impact this series.\r\nFor people not very informed, Kugimiya Rie has played the role of a tsundere with fairly similar personalities in 4 different anime works (Shana, Zero no Tsukaima, Hayate no Gotoku, Zettai Karen Children).  I liked the use of a deeper, lower tone for Taiga and I acknowledge this, but I simply found the (over) use of Rie rather stifling.\r\nStory- 6/10\\n\\n\r\nA fairly normal high school setting which sets the stage for the intriguing characters to work on.  The story is really character-driven and while the characters do a great job, the background course of events are less than stellar, like as if a B-rate movie writer did it.  The events of the Cultural Festival, and the Ski Trip were really touching, and that made me almost raise the rating to 7.  However, the pacing seems to drag on over the winter period but feels rather rushed towards the end with bits and pieces missing.  I just didn't feel really satisfied with this.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the cast and the way they transformed over the course of the series.  We get given characters with rather eccentric personalities which work nicely with everyone else.  There is good coverage of the thoughts, feelings and the transformation that occurs in the main leads and that is really pleasing to see.  I would personally liked to have seen more airtime for Ami's personality growth as she's probably the deepest person in the entire cast, and the \"answer\" to her was really rushed.  Overall a really great, and enjoyable cast.\\n\\n\r\nThe Seiyuu for Ryuuj/Nojima Hirofumi put in a solid performance but my pick of the lot is Minorin/Horie Yui who really brought up Minorin's eccentricity and hyperactivity in an excellent fashion.  My gripe with Taiga has already been mentioned.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nNothing fancy in the BGM but I really loved the OP themes.  The two OPs really conveyed the mood of the story as it changed from one to another.  The timing in which OP2 was introduced was perfect.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 6/10\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment in Toradora was closely linked with the story.  Unfortunately, despite the characters which gave me great joy worthy of an 8, the story felt really dragged out, so at the end of it all I feel it's a mildly enjoying show overall, but not one where my mind would get totally transfixed to.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation - 6/10\\n\\n\r\nFairly good and consistent.  It's no KyoAni but does the job.",

            "content": "The premise of the show is pretty hard to believe. After an accidental meeting involving two violent outbursts, Taiga Aisaka and Ryuuji Takasu make an agreement to help one another pursue their respective love interests, Kitamura and Kushieda, who also happen to be Ryuuji and Taiga's mutual friends. It's the stockholm syndrome trope, create a situation in which the two main characters are forced to spend large amounts of time together and wait for them to fall in love. High school \u2018contracts\u2019 are an object of fiction, much like the accidentally overheard conversations that drive most of the character development. People do overhear things occasionally,but when the relationship is progressed entirely through cliches, it\u2019s pretty hard to take it seriously.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, after a rocky beginning I actually began to enjoy watching Taiga and Ryuuji. Ryuuji is more functional than most adults, doing all the cooking and cleaning for his mom who comes home late from her job as a cocktail waitress and sleeps most of the day. Ryuuji finds another dependent in Taiga, whom he feeds and launders for on a daily basis. He discovers her living amongst dirty dishes and garbage after entering her unlocked apartment to wake her up and make her breakfast. What\u2019s important here is Ryuuji isn\u2019t just a caretaker to Taiga, he represents something she\u2019s never had, a person who genuinely cares about her and accepts her for who she is. He's a surrogate parent, which will be incredibly significant as we learn more of her backstory. He doesn\u2019t complain that Taiga\u2019s a mess, he just helps her pick it up and she slowly improves. This relationship does have some kind of benefit for Ryuuji as well, though it's far from ideal for him.\\n\\n\r\nHe seems to derive enjoyment from taking care of the dysfunctional Taiga, and given his relationship with his mother, who's equally bad at taking care of herself, it's very understandable that he's okay with it, he's used to it after all. But not only is their relationship is entirely one-sided, Ryuuji deals with being verbally and physically abused by Taiga constantly, aggression can definitely be attractive in a girl, but there's a difference between being aggressive and abusive. As part of their agreement, Taiga calls him a dog and commands him to do whatever she wishes... and he agrees. I guess he just really, REALLY wants Kushieda, and somehow plotting schemes with the diminutive and violent Taiga seems a better idea to him than simply talking to somebody he's already friends with. It's not like Kushieda's distant with him either, she bubbly, confident, and provides Ryuuji multiple opportunities to get closer to her, hell, they get locked in a storage room together for hours. At this point the overbearing use of cliches started to make me believe Toradora! was a satire, but given the amount of melodrama I'm pretty sure that it's takes its romance seriously. However, it\u2019s important to remember that it\u2019s Kushieda he\u2019s interested in, so it\u2019s not like the show is trying to force TaigaxRyuuji down your throat, they\u2019re simply spending time together, so Ryuuji maintaining Kushieda as a love interest helps the story feel somewhat believable, despite Taiga\u2019s abuse.\\n\\n\r\nAs the plot continues to carve its destructive path, Ami is introduced, and with her, more opportunities for \"contract\" agreements that force characters to be in the same place together despite their apparent misgivings. I'm not sure if Ryuuji is aware that he isn't legally bound by the results of immature high school contests. In any case, the writers continue to create contrived situations that force character interactions that would not otherwise happen.\\n\\n\r\nI liked both Ryuuji and Taiga, despite the unbelievable circumstances that make up their character development. I stated before Ryuuji enjoys cooking and cleaning and is very good at both of them, this detail is the precipitating factor for most of their interactions. Taiga is pretty helpless when it comes to household tasks and Ryuuji provides those services to her. Despite the horribly unrealistic circumstances I felt that Taiga and Ryuuji actually acted in reasonable ways for the most part. Taiga beats Ryuuji frequently but it's clear that she actually does like spending time with him. They're both laughably bad at pursuing their romantic interest but that's pretty typical of high schoolers so it's hardly surprising.\\n\\n\r\nKushieda is obnoxiously positive. She shares many traits with Ryuuji including domestic competence and is very hard working. I'm sure you've all encountered that person in high school who magically balanced multiple jobs, sports, and school, all while staying unusually cheery. Most of the time she was on screen I just found her really annoying, she's just WAY too positive, there is such a thing. I don't think she was necessarily a bad character, just not the type of character I liked and I wasn't remotely invested in her. I didn't care if Ryuuji made in success in pursuing her because 1. Taiga the obvious romantic interest so you know that nothing's going to happen anyway, and 2. because Ryuuji was such an idiot when it came to trying to win her over that I wanted him to fail. She also becomes the source of more forced drama later on, making it even harder to take seriously and threatening to ruin ending.\\n\\n\r\nKitamura is the man. At first you get the impression that he's the stereotypical \"obvlivious anime male highschool student\" but he has his own agenda, and it plays out in spectacular fashion. You have not seen a love confession until you\u2019ve seen Kitamura. To be fair, his arc\u2019s only purpose is to help make TaigaxRyuuji a thing, it also results in a fantastic sword fight, but he\u2019s still pretty funny to watch.\\n\\n\r\nKawashima is introduced later and is absolutely fantastic. She\u2019s far more mature than the rest of the cast due to growing up as a model in the \u201cadult\u201d world, but is stunted in some ways by her air of superiority. Her development was the best part of the show and creates some of the only believable drama between characters. Her conversations with Ryuuji are similarly realistic, they are rarely on the same page but it\u2019s clear to the audience what she\u2019s trying to tell him, which makes their interactions much easier to understand, why Kawashima finds Ryuuji interesting etc.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest mark against the show is that it\u2019s totally drowned in melodrama. Taiga overreacts in ways the get old fast, and the forced pathos ruins the genuinely emotional moments in the show. I need to emphasize this, there were truly some great emotional moments. The Christmas episode with the bear costume (you\u2019ll know it when you see it) [i]almost[/i] caused me to shed a tear, a feat that only Grave of the Fireflies is capable of, but because of the melodrama surrounding most of the show, these scenes lose their effect. Of course, there\u2019s also the incredibly contrived situations (See accidentally overheard conversations/confessions) that bring these scenes about, which doesn\u2019t help.\\n\\n\r\nThe production quality was fairly good, I liked the character designs and the animation quality was impressive at times and never bad. Nothing else about its artwork or animation stood out but that\u2019s not terrible in a romcom. The OST was kind of forgettable but does add a lot to the emotion in certain scenes and I wasn\u2019t a fan of the OP/EDs.\\n\\n\r\nToradora! certainly isn\u2019t bad. Despite its issues it delivers an heartfelt romance with well-defined characters, but the frustration with its asinine story telling was enough to outweigh most of the positive aspects. If you like melodrama, you\u2019ll probably like Toradora!.\\n\\n\r\nOne final note, the ending is talked about incessantly, and it is very good. Many complain that it was rushed and didn't explain things well enough, but if you pay attention to the character\u2019s values and motivations, you shouldn\u2019t need the writers to spoon feed you Taiga\u2019s reasons for why she did what she did. Just make sure you watch the last episode all the way through, past the credits and everything.\\n",

            "content": "It seems JC Staff loves to makes animes out of light novel publications from ASCII Media Works. Toradora! is one of their newest adaptations, and in the genre of romance/comedy that has been overdone extensively already, I am pleased to say that this anime has exceeded my expectations greatly.\r\nStory: There is nothing extraodinary about the story in Toradora, I dare say its a cliched scenario of the 2 main characters being together for all the series to find out in the end they love each other. However the way Toradora excecutes and delivers this story was done so well that even if the outcomes andevents looked predictable, it would still keep you on your toes and make you want more.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: This anime's strong point was not on the visual department, however it was still well animated and throughout the show we would be treated to a very rich and colorful anime that was pleasing to the eyes.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: Toradora proves that you dont need an awesome soundtrack to make an anime sound fantastic. Apart from a couple of tunes from the OST, there is really no standout songs in the show. However the songs are used so well in the anime they are able to really enhance the enjoyment of important scenes, making the show much more enjoyable. Also very solid voice acting, as expected from a top class voice actress as Kugimiya Rie but I was also highly impressed with Majima Junji's role as Ryuuji. Perfectly excecuted.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: This is by far the show's best aspect. Not every anime is able to deliver such likeable characters and make them blend together so well. Throughout the series I was in constant debate on which of the main heroines I liked most, because the anime manages to develop every character so well. Even the supporting characters are very likeable, and are well developed in this show. And to my surprise, for this genre of anime the show managed to deliver a main male lead that I did not find a complete idiot.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Man this show has been a blast to watch, every week I would go thinking they couldnt top last week's episode yet they still managed to do it almost every time. This is definitely one of my new favourites animes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: In the romance/comedy category, it is very easy for an anime to fall into the \"overdone\" category, despite all that, Toradora is able to keep a refreshing and interesting pace for most of its run and for that I salute JC Staff for this brilliant adaptation to a great novel. This anime proves that even if you dont have a groundbreaking plot, if you are able to provide an excellent execution with what you have you can still produce a top quality anime. If you are looking for a great romcom that is able to set itself apart from others and is able to maintain a great level of entertainment and quality, then I am sure Toradora will not disappoint you and I highly recommend it to anyone.\\n",

It was not of the two anime that introduced me to the rom-com genre back in 2012 the other one being Clannad but it was the first romcom anime that I ever loved. I loved it so much that when I eventually started to buy animes DVDs back in 2015 Toradora was the third anime I purchased. From that point on I re-watched Toradora least 2 to 3 times per year and I still love iteven if it had some flaws that I started to notice on my last re-watch of it. Now unlike Clannad where my opinion of that show worst as years went on to a point, I haven\u2019t touched my Season 1 and After Story DVD sets for almost a year thanks to me having a low value of the series due to it serious killing flaws. My opinion on Toradora has stayed positive to this day despite its minor flaws I still think Toradora is the best modern romcom anime to ever come out.\\n\r\nSo what made Toradora so special.\\n\r\nWhy do I still love this show to this day?\\n\r\nWell let's find out, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nThe story follows Ryuji Takasu who is getting ready for his second year at high school. Despite being an overall nice guy he has a mistaking reputation for looking like a delinquent thanks to he evil looking eyes as well as his facial structure looking like a young yakuza member rather than a high school student. His best friend Yuusaku as well his crush Minori (whom he is too bashful to approach) are the only two people who actually don\u2019t mind his evil looking eye appearance. Soon by complete accident, he bumps into a main female lead and tsundere Taiga Aisaka aka the Palmtop Tiger.\\n\\n\r\nAfter an accidental first encounter that ends with Taiga KO-ing him in the face, Ryuuji finds out at the end of the school day that Taiga has put a love letter to Kitamura (whom she has a crush on but is too bashful to approach) in his bag by accident. This leads to Taiga breaking into his house that night to retrieve the letter by killing him with a bamboo sword only to discover that she forgot to put the letter in the envelope and has inadvertently outed her crush on Kitamura to Ryuuji.\\n\r\nAfter much ado and a few sword-blows, Ryuuji and Taiga strike a tenuous deal to use their positions as The Best Friends to help each other bag their respective crushes.\\n\\n\r\nNow the story of Toradora may be very simple in nature but the execution is downright amazing.\\n\r\nRight out the bat, the show makes a great first impression as the first episode does a wonderful job at establishing the setting, tone, characters, and themes of the show. The show also knows what it wants as it says true to its roots as a slice of life, drama romcom series without being something that is not.\\n\r\nThe show does a brilliant job of exploring the themes and topics of running away, true love, being your true self, breaking your shell and it does them all great.\\n\r\nThe show also does a great job at keeping the audience with all the story events that happen in the show by having great writing and for the most part great overall pacing.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Toradora are all fantastic.\\n\r\nRyuji is a great male lead. He may appear as this generic delinquent who hates everyone with that Yakuza look but he\u2019s actually a nice and friendly guy who care for others. He also an obsessive neat freak where he doesn\u2019t like messy houses and he would go out of his way to clean everything that he can. The best example of this was when Ryuji enters Taiga house for the first time. Despite Ryuiji having great personality traits he\u2019s is a well-developed character who has great character chemistry with the cast especially Taiga.\\n\\n\r\nTaiga despite being the queen of tsundere is actually a pretty great character. From start to finish I liked her character development as her interactions towards the rest of the cast. She may appear as this Lousie and Shana but unlike Lousie and at times Shana where they are tsundere for the sake for it Taiga\u2019s tsundere behaviour rarely mirror her true feelings.\\n\r\nShe may not be for everyone but if you can pass her tsundere side you will start to see how humanly flawed Taiga is as a person.\\n\\n\r\nIf I had to pick my favourite character in Toradora it would be Minori. \\n\r\nShe is a sweet and upbeat person who loves to keep everybody happy but there\u2019s a lot than that. In order for her to cope with own internal struggles and loneliness, she plays softball as well as working on a series of part-time jobs. Her character development in the series was great and I really loved every scene that she\u2019s was in. Overall brilliant character.\\n\\n\r\nNow we have Kitamura Taiga crush and Ryuji best friend. Not gonna lie I thought I Kitamaru was pretty bland in the beginning as he just came as this typical smart guy chararters. Thankfully he does become a much better character as the series as he had a great character arc that was well told and it had a satisfying conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, we have Ami who is a childhood friend of Kitamura who before transferring schools, she was a fashion designer. \\n\r\nShe may start off as this typical fan-service character but there is much more to her. In school, she plays a facade where she behaves as this cute and ditzy girl but she\u2019s actually a mean and spoiled bitch. I honestly really loved this character. She\u2019s probably my second favourite character in the show only losing to Minori. She is just is a joy to watch every-time she was on screen especially in the end of her character arc where she confronts the guy who takes pictures of her by smashing his camera while giving that devious look to him.\\n\\n\r\nThe side characters are good for what they were but apart from Yuri and Sumire the side characters are not as memorable as the mains.\\n\\n\r\nI could go on and on how great this anime is sadly I have to talk about the show\u2019s flaws because there are only two of them.\\n\\n\r\nFor starters, I didn\u2019t like the portrayal of Ryuji mom where she doesn\u2019t really behave an adult figure where instead of being a prideful or strick mother she often behaves like a kid who lazy and constantly have parties while the child always picks up all the things for them. Am not saying that Adults cannot have any fun whatsoever because I believe that all adults should have fun when are not working but Ryuji mother doesn\u2019t feel like a responsible mother at all. As much I liked how Ryuji mother aspects Taiga as a family member she doesn\u2019t really set any rules or do anything that a mother should do.\\n\\n\r\nThe second and final minor flaw is its predictable nature. Personally, I don\u2019t mind if a show is predictable in nature because as long if it\u2019s written well I can completely ignore its predictable nature and thankfully Toradora, for the most part, is a great ride that I enjoyed even it\u2019s predictable. However if you a person who is not a fan of predictable stories than this show will most likely won\u2019t like this show especially when certain scenes in Toradora actually highlight the end of the show before you even get there.\\n\\n\r\nOther than the two minor flaws which I just mentioned the story and characters in Toradora was amazing.\\n\\n\r\nJ.C Staff is known to have great art in the shows that the make and Toradora is no different.\\n\r\nThe background scenery is very appealing to look at thanks to smooth soft colour pallet. The charterers for both the main and supporting were aagreat looking.\\n\r\nAs for the actual animation itself, I thought it was very good and well handled. Sure the beginning the animation is basic stuff but when we get to the actual action and emotional scenes of the series the animation really shines. The best examples of this were Taiga vs Sumire fight in episode 16 to Taiga emotional breakdown in episode 19.\\n\r\nFantastic job J.C Staff\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for Toradora is fantastic and nicely composed. I know not many people were a not fan of the soundtrack and I can understand they are coming from but I thought the soundtrack for Toradora was well made as it perfectly captures the tone and setting of Toradora perfectly. One of the song track Lost my Pieces from Toradora is not only my favourite track from Toradora but it\u2019s also my second favourite track piece from a romance only losing to Always be With You from Kodocha.\\n\\n\r\nSome of my other favourite tracks include Startup, Magic of Love, Morning Glory, Happy Monday and Ready Steady Go. They are just brilliant tracks overall.\\n\\n\r\nAll the opening and endings themes in Toradora are great in their own ways and they are extremely catchy.\\n\\n\r\nNow for sub vs dub.\\n\r\nI only saw the sub twice back in 2012 but I remember it being great filled with talented Seiyuus. However, as soon as I put in DVD disc one for Toradora as well watching the first couple of episodes dubbed I immediately decided to never touch the sub again. Don\u2019t get me wrong the sub is great but the dub was a special case of awesomeness. Out of all the romcom anime that I have seen Toradora has the best English dub that I have seen from a romcom anime. I was blown away by how awesome the dub was as every single voice actor and I mean every single one did a fantastic job voicing their respective characters. The one thing that the Toradora dub had over the sub is how realistic the acting was. Just a well-made and directed dub overall.\\n\\n\r\nToradora is a perfect example of a modern romcom anime done right. The story is well written, theme exploration is masterful, the characters are wonderful in their own ways, the visuals were nice, the soundtrack was great and the English dub was perfect.\\n\\n\r\nToradora is not only the best modern romcom anime to ever come out it\u2019s but it\u2019s also my third favourite romcom anime period. The show may not be for everyone but for those who adored the series such we can get past its predictable nature and flaws we see a show that is beautiful and heartwarming.\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re looking for a great romcom anime that has great characters and amazing themes exploration then I recommend Toradora.\\n\r\nIt is a anime that will forerver stay in my elite four of romcom anime.",

Both Taiga and Ryuj are unable to convey their feelings to the person they have feeling for. Therefore, they team up and try to fix their problems together. As if that isn't enough, a secretive demon like actress is thrown into the mix. Many hilarious and troubling events take place so that you end up falling in love with Toradora before it ends. It's cute, a good laugh, and well animated. In every category it's avery enjoyable watch! I'd recommend it to everyone that likes a high school story about love and life.\\n\\n\r\nSo why the low score? Let's just say, I despised the ending. In order to keep from revealing anything, I won't say why. I loved the show up till the end of episode 19. Certain events took place that made me hate the show with a burning passion. That doesn't stop me from suggesting it to everyone else though. Most people liked it, and I bet you will too!",

            "content": "I'll keep this short and simple. Screw this anime.\r\nSound and art are fine. Not really too detailed art with a little bit of comedy sketches. The sound matches well with the series which would give it a higher score if the series was good.\r\nNow the reason why this series sucks. TAIGA IS A GIANT BITCH. That should be tazered and thrown into Mount Doom. I get the appeal of Tsundere which is the demographic for this show. Taiga is the completely horrible side of Tsundere. Tsundere are supposed to be a tale of two sides with a harsh side balancing a hidden sweet side. IFthe harsh side is a psychopath I don't give a damn if there is a sweet side. I don't even need to go past the first episode to prove that this girl is certifiable. She breaks into the protagonist's home, illegal, assaults him with a deadly weapon, illegal, damages his property, illegal, and then extorts him to get her to leave, illegal.\\n\\n\r\nPeople in the anime world, abuse isn't fine if it's female on male. It's one thing if it's a single hit or insult every once in awhile but Taiga does this abuse constantly. It makes her completely unlikable for anyone who has dealt with abuse before and can't just laugh off a shit character. The easiest way to see if it hits the double standard is flip the genders. This becomes a freaking black comedy/horror if you switch the protagonist's genders.\\n\\n\r\nI get the reason why people laugh at pain. Watching a drunk guy on youtube fall over himself and try to base jump off his roof is pretty damn funny. What I don't get is why anyone would willingly hang out with a person that makes your life hell by insulting and hurting you all the time. \\n\\n\r\nAny story that would try and portray a character like that as lead heroine role needs to be burned with fire. I would give this anime a zero but watching Taiga get her karmic justice raises the score. 2 out of 10 Recommendation: Put it on a rocket ship, fly it out to unknown coordinates, and hyper beam it into oblivion. The perfect example of how NOT to make a Tsundere lead in a romantic comedy (Her and Louise Valliere of Familiar of Zero).",

            "content": "When you think of a romance, comedy, school life/slice of life, you think about an anime with two (or more) lovers as they go through thick and thin together. That certainly does not fit the description of Toradora!. In fact, I don't think anything is able to describe just how funny, touching, deep, and serious Toradora! is. \r\nI started watching Toradora! after reading the first few chapters of the manga. At first, I thought it was one of those series focusing purely on romance and comedy. I thought it was a carefree series that will bring watchers some laughs with some moments of romance. Thefirst few episodes did seem to be leaning toward this direction. However, as the story develops, I was blown away. The story and characters were so complex, fascinating, and unique that the description of a \"carefree comedy romance anime\" just can't fit Toradora!. Not at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe story, at its introduction, is simple. Takasu Ryuuji and Aisaka Taiga both have crushes on the other's friend. They decide to help each other. Really simple, and predictable right? Nope. As the story propels forward, so many wild and heartwarming events occur make the relationships between the friends not so clear. The story moves along a very smooth pace as well. Like other comedy/romance anime, Toradora! develops the story w/ episodic events. Unlike the others however, it blends the main plot and each event very well, so that you'll never see just an event (such as a house party or summer trip) that's just there for enjoyment. In Toradora!, the events drive the story, not the other way around.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes the story so much exciting, unpredictable, and anticipated are the wonderful characters of Toradora!. At the onset, the characters are introduced, and each have an obvious trait/personality that you have no problem identifying. Takasu is mean-looking and scares people, but he really is the ideal guy: nice, reliable, friendly. Kushieda Minori is the cheerful girl and Aisaka's best friend who is always energized and lighting up the mood. However, there is so much more than just that. As the story progresses, the characters do as well. Each character faces trials and obstacles in the story. As a result, they develop, change, and gradually become different. In addition, each character has inner feelings and pasts that influence their way of dealing with things. \\n\\n\r\nAs you watch each episode, the main cast is so well created that you'll forget they're just figures of fiction. You will treat them as real beings, sympathizing with one and perhaps disapproving another. Your own feelings will change as the characters change. All of this leads to a wonderful experience that is Toradora!.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is well drawn. Backgrounds are clear, colorful, and sharp. Character movement is smooth. The sound is rendered and timed perfectly. Each background song/sound fits with the scene, and adds strength to it. The opening and ending songs are also very well chosen, perfectly fitting with the general theme of Toradora!.\\n\\n\r\nI have greatly enjoyed Toradora!. I had average expectations and saw some potential in Toradora! when I started watching it in Oct. 08, when the Fall 2008 season came out. Unlike so many other anime that start with great beginning but only to degenerate, Toradora! shot through the roof of mediocrity with its great characters and story. It satisfied many viewers and went on to become even better as each week passed. Now that I've seen all 25 episodes, I must say, it was an incredible series.",

            "content": "Toradora is based off of some romantic comedy light novels written by Takemiya Yuyuko. From October '08 to March '09, an anime adaptation aired. It was brought to us by J.C. Staff, the same studio behind Shakugan no Shana, Yami no Matsuei & Hachimitsu to Clover. So, this could be terrible, really good or bland, based on that. The anime version's writer doesn't help narrow things down either. It was handled by Okada Mari. She's worked on such anime as Canaan & Kuroshitsuji II. So, let's take a  look and see if this is one of J.C's better works, or at least entertainingly badlike their work on Garzey no Tsubasa. \\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nRyuuji  has romantic feelings for his classmate, Kushieda. Kushieda's best friend, Taiga, has a crush on Ryuuji's best friend, Kitamura. A fact that Ryuuji learns when she mistakenly leaves  love letter in his bag. Ryuuji and Taiga become friends, planning to help one another in order to make their romantic dreams come true. Next stop, shenanigans. \\n\\n\r\nThe biggest flaw with the series is that its relatively unique set up for a rom-com becomes progressively more clich\u00e9d and predictable as the series progresses. In fact, a lot of you will be able to guess how the series ends just from applying romantic comedy logic to that short description. It's a shame because the early stuff can be fairly amusing. The series also has its share of always so \u201cwonderful\u201d jokes about a girl hitting a guy. Although, in all fairness, they aren't as prevalent in Toradora as they are in certain other series. The main romance is also quite bad with a convoluted love... heptagon... no, hexagon and with several overly melodramatic moments leading up to it.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the positives. To reiterate, the early episodes are pretty entertaining and there are some genuinely funny moments in there with clever set ups and good pay offs. Seeing Ryuuji and Taiga try to help one another leads to quite a few good jokes. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this aren't particularly complex, but they're perfectly functional for a comedic series and most of the main cast get their share of good comedic moments. Where the series really excels is with the developing friendship between Ryuuji and Taiga early on. Although, the series sets about ruining it in the second half. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in this is pretty good. Granted, they don't have to do much with it since most of the series takes place in a rather generic townscape and at a rather generic school, but it has some strong details and the characters do look unique. The series also has some success at using lighting to set the mood at various points. It's a nice little detail. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThey got some good actors for this series. Kugimiya Rie, Majima Junji, Horie Yui, Nojima Hirofumi & Kitamura Eri are all fine actors. I won't claim that Toradora shows any of them at their absolute best, but there's enough for them to work with that they can show their skills. The music is pretty mediocre. There's nothing that really sets it apart from the music of any other romantic comedy. \\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nThere are points in the story where it definitely seems like Kushieda has feelings beyond friendship for Taiga. But as the series continues and becomes more trite, it becomes apparent that that isn't the case. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nToradora is a series with a strong start. In the beginning, it has a lot going for it. A legitimately different premise. Some strong comedic scenes. A good dynamic betwixt Ryuuji and Taiga. However, as the series progresses it gradually eliminates all of that. It tosses  it away to make things, to be completely frank, boring and generic. Instead of taking some risks, Takemiya decides to play it the safe, dull route we've seen in every romantic comedy ever made. As a result, the series squanders its early good will and ends things on a disappointing note. I sill wouldn't call it a bad series but I would say it ends up being as mediocre as Hachimitsu to Clover. My final rating is a 5/10. If you really like the standard rom-com clich\u00e9s, you'll probably like it throughout. If you want something unique in any way you'll spend the first half of the series thinking \u201cthis could work if they don't decide to bog it down with obvious clich\u00e9s\u201d and the second half pressing your palm against your face a lot. Next week I'll look at Sword Art Online II.",

            "content": "Toradora .. it is considered one of the best romance anime of all time .. well i disagree. I only saw a couple of romances and i already saw 3 romances that for me were better than Toradora. \r\nWhy this anime for me is over rated? Well it has nothing special to offer .. pretty usual, pretty normal, the romance is predictable, well nothing here excels in my opinion. \r\nStory: 7/10. I only gave a 7 to the story because we have a interesting way of starting an anime. The rest ? Clich\u00ea. Everything ! Not even one character is original, everyone are clich\u00ea andnot even one is interesting. I kinda guessed the end when i was in the 4th ep or so .. and I did it right, the end was just what I expected to be ... why is that? BECAUSE IT'S A ********* clich\u00ea and like every clich\u00ea out there, they are predictable and boring. But still the story is good enough.. there is no plot holes, everything fits right. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10. Really really crappy art. The characters look ugly.. it seems that they just changed the size of the boobs, the hair colour and the eyes colour between the female characters. Look on the web and see if i'm not right. There is even 2 characters that i just could distinguish by hearing their voices... -.-. The background is also pretty bad. But .. the design i think it's well done after all and fits well with the character's personality. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10. Actually the best aspect here. It makes the comedy moments much more fun. The voice acting is pretty good also. The openings are funny especially the first one. About the OST, they fit nice and i found no problems on them .. Although the OST for the drama could be better .. it's pretty smooth for me xD \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10. Like i said they all are clich\u00ea characters .. predictable movements, predictable choices, predictable reactions .. where is the fun watching this? But i do have to say they have a nice development, all of them have a different personality and it's interesting seeing the interaction between the characters. But again, they are clich\u00eas so as their background stories. I was having a deja'vu every time they explained some character's past. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10. It is a clich\u00ea .. but at least it's funny to watch and entertains well. Although .. because i already had predicted the end, the romane got extremely weak for me, and it looked pretty rough, i mean at least i don\u00b4t like that type of romance. I'm one of those who likes cute things. I can\u00b4t lie to you, i saw this anime in 3 days so i had fun while i was watching that's for sure. But it's because it is a comedy show with some drama on it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10. I'm being generous giving this anime a 7/10. I like to get suprised and here i got everything right. To much predictable, at least for me it sucks. Although for a comedy is nice, for a slice of life is also good. But i advise you, if you heard the same as i \"Toradora is one of the best romances of all time\" .. IT'S WRONG. For me, it was just a normal romance, so it can\u00b4t be the best. So don\u00b4t get hype for then get disappointment like i had. \\n\\n\r\nIf you like romance/comedy/slice of life, this is a good show .. but not one of the best romance animes. It just looks pretty normal to be one of the best.",

            "content": "I don't usually watch the romantic comedy genre of things. I always enjoyed action, fantasy, adventure like Soul Eater, Cowboy Bebop, Trigun etc. but for some reason I was in the mood for something different. \r\nToradora is just the 3rd romcom anime series i watched and I can truly say that it has become my FAVORITE anime.\r\nThe short version of this review is: I very much enjoyed Toradora\r\n-The characters are all unique, likable, and relatable due to the fact they all display their weak sides sometimes and moments of insecurity behind the personality exterior. The chemistry between the characters was fun to watch\r\n-The story staysaway from cliches and was relatively unpredictable for a love story. Every character had a reason and motive for what they did and how they acted, other than just being unnaturally dumb/too prideful/stubborn.\\n\\n\r\n-The soundtrack was really good, making certain scenes all the more memorable\\n\\n\r\n-I loved the comedic scenarios in the beginning of the series, which gets progressively more serious and emotional as we get deeper into the story and characters, but the overall vibe of the show stays relatively consistent to the end\\n\\n\r\n-I became emotionally invested in the overall plot and characters and couldn't stop watching, which is extremely rare for me, especially for this genre\\n\\n\r\nOverall:10/10\\n\\n\r\n----\\n\\n\r\nI watched the 1st episode and was interested. After the 2nd ep, I was hooked. I watched all 25 episodes in one go, back to back, because I couldn't stop. Never has another series been able to keep me going (I usually don't watch more than 5 episodes in one sitting), but Toradora kept me wanting to click on the next episode each time until I was finished, and left wanting more (even though I was satisfied with the ending)\\n\\n\r\nAfterwards, I thought a lot about why an anime series of a genre that is usually not my taste could have been able to retain my attention for so long, and i realized the answers: the characters and the overall story.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are what make this series so great. Each character have personalities that are unique and rather realistic and believable (or as realistic as animes go). There is no \"super\" character that acts too good or too cool for school. There is no \"that annoying\" character that acts too snobby or stuck up, which can sometimes be a problem for tsundere characters. And this is all because every character shows a weak side or moments of insecurity, which makes each of them more relatable. It also allows for many rather comedic scenes as well as emotional moments. But the best part is the interactions and chemistry between all the characters, and the way each of them change as their relationship with each other grows.\\n\\n\r\nThe second thing is the story. The reason I usually don't care for romance or drama is because I usually find the story too cliche or predictable. I also hate those cliche moments of \"coincidence\", for example, when a main character happens to see his/her love interest with someone else accidentally and misunderstands. I also hate it when characters act unnaturally stupid or too prideful for no reason and let it get in the way of the relationship. \\n\\n\r\nBut none of those cliche moments happen in Toradora. Every character has a reason and motive for the actions they decide to take. The story managed to keep me guessing and wanting to know what will happen next, instead of making me feel like i could write the story myself.\\n\\n\r\nAnother plus for Toradora is the music. There are some key scenes where the soundtrack actually triggered goosebumps and made me tear; it still does even after rewatching. THAT IS RARE FOR ME. In fact i don't think anything I've ever watched, not just anime, can even make me feel that emotionally invested in fictional characters.\\n\\n\r\nAlmost forgot to mention that after it was done, I started to watch it again from the beginning the next day. Another rare occurrence for me, as usually i don't feel like rewatching things for months.  I was able to pick up certain things that i missed with the first watch thru. The only reason I put the story as 9/10 was because of this. A few plot points weren't really shown or conveyed in the best way and were missed even to an avid viewer like me. But I was glad to have felt that way, leaving me thinking about what I missed, instead of feeling like I could have easily figured it out or seen it coming. \\n\\n\r\nAgain, Toradora has become my favorite anime, as a guy that usually doesn't care for this genre, which says a lot. It gave me more enjoyment than any of the other anime I have seen so far. I would recommend it to anyone, not just romance lovers.",

Here's the explanation:\r\nI felt the sensation changed 4 times while watch this anime:\r\n1st time: During episodes 1 to 2, watching those episodes for the first time I thought this series would just be a light comedy anime which will make me chuckle without a  complicated story. It just like the spring season that give a high hopes on the early year.\r\n2nd time: During episodes 3 to 14, I'm getting a bit bored and almost drop it, but I decided to pushmy self to finish it (the only reasons I want to finish it is just because I got interest by the last main character who showed up in this part). It just like summer season that is really hot, and the only fun is going to beach during the summer break.\\n\\n\r\n3rd time: During episodes 15 to 24, my curiosity was piqued for what will be going on with this show, things got a bit complicated, and I think this part is the \"life\" of the series. Just like an autumn season, although the flowers fall, but becomes a wonderful scenery.\\n\\n\r\n4th time: During the final episode, \"WHAT THE HELL\", with this final episode, I mean everything seems fine at the beginning of the episode, but in the end it turned out anti-climatic for me. Just like the winter season, unpredictable storms, snow, and always cold; but after that Spring comes.\\n\\n\r\nWell, that's my personal view of the story, so I give 7/10 for it.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound, nothing particular to comment, it all seem good enough, and I like the second opening OST. 7/10 for both of it.\\n\\n\r\nAll characters were unique, both in design and personalities, even with the supporting characters, they are all really good. A great job was done by the creator at this point. EXCEPT for MC's pet, it's very annoying, and I really like \"Ami-n\", her appearance, her personality, her reactions, her way of pretending to be an adult (she's the last MC that I mentioned before), so 8/10 For Chara design.\\n\\n\r\nFor the enjoyment, I think I'll go for 7/10 that because this show had me feel bored once, and the ending was anti-climatic for me, but I do like the humor and story development (starting from episode 15).\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10 score for this show.",

            "content": "Moderator Edit: This review contains spoilers.\r\n-------------------\r\nToradora!= Another normal romance/drama anime involving high school...We had many anime of this kind. In fact, these type of anime are very common nowadays. I had watched this type many times, but mostly ended up so wrongly. \r\nBut this time, Toradora! is done the right way. Yup, I ended up loving this \"normal\" anime. Story involves two high-schoolers, a normal guy, and a short girl....Now where have I heard that from? Many anime had this kind of story. Yup, It kinda gives me feelings of Deja Vu-ness. This time its done the way I like it. On to the review....\r\nStory-Involves a ordinary guy named Ryuuji Takasu and a short and short-tempered girl named Aisaka Taiga. This reminds of Saito and Louise from the Zero no Tsukaima series. Where the protagonist always gets beaten up by the girl, yeah those type. And more strangely, most of these short anime girls are always so strong or feared by many..thats Taiga a.k.a Palmtop Tiger. While Ryuuji only looks scary, but in reality, he's pretty harmless. OK~ enough of that...Why only a 7 for the story? Its pretty common..and its very predictable. I knew Ryuuji would end up with Taiga even just by looking at the cover art without watching the anime!. So obvious, so predictable, which makes it a bit boring. This flaw is common in many romance/drama anime, but its quite annoying. Story have a very good pace but it took quite a while for both of the hero and heroine to fall in love. Yup, they fell in love...but it took so long! But that's a good thing right? haahha- well~ those are the flaws I found here. Story= 7 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nArt- Graphics are rather unusual but very good..which I would say, Graphics are unique, that's for sure. Good graphics should receive a good score!\\n\r\nArt= 9 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nSound-  The anime had 2 OP and 2 ED...1st OP was...strange. Same goes for the 1st ED. But the 2nd? Both the 2nd OP and ED are both awesome~. The 2nd OP tells  Ryuuji and Taiga's \"love\" arc is going to start. Don't get any wrong ideas. XD\\n\r\nSound= 9 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- All characters are uniquely made...Yup, especially Taiga and Minori. Minori had a very funny attitude which I loved. Awesome characters, awesome score.\\n\r\nCharacter= 10 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- I enjoyed every single episode there was, some were very memorable but few are forgettable. I personally, enjoyed every minute of the anime which included comedy, parodies, romance, and some parts were very sad. Sad, but not as sad as Ef- Tale of memories. Toradora! can make you have \"watery eyes\", but Ef probably can make you cry. Beyond Awesome enjoyment.\\n\r\nEnjoyment= 10 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall= Toradora! is not really recommended for everyone to watch, but Its highly recommended for fans of Romance/drama/comedy anime with a bit of sadness. If you bought it, its worth every penny. Anyone looking for some romance, then this could be your answer to that question. If you watch it online, its worth every minute and if you downloaded it, its worth every bits of data. \\n\r\nOVERALL= 10 out of 10. Really loved it.",

            "content": "Romance has always been a tricky, unforgiving genre; you make one mistake and the story slowly begins to crumble. Why is that? Well, as many of us may know, love is a complicated business. So is entertainment. So why do we watch romantic series? There's many different answers that vary based on the individual. Maybe we're simply taking a chance at trying to find a feeling. A feeling of the tingle of our heartstrings, or a stir in our human emotions. It's good to feel these things from time to time. Fortunately for us, Toradora is a series that gracefully grants us this chance. Itcaptivates us in remembering what a romance series should strive to be.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes Toradora so exceptional as far as the romance genre goes? Is it the story? The art? The Sound? The Characters? It just may be all of them combined. I'd like to begin by stating something. The story of Toradora is very predictable. Clich\u00e9 even. But wait, isn't that a bad thing? While the story may seem plain, the execution of the pacing is undeniably good at assuming a calm, relaxed flow for the majority of its run which, in turn, yields a satisfying romantic series as a result.\\n\\n\r\nToradora is not like many other romantic series out there that have characters fall in love simply just because. Love slowly stems from what begins as two people who become friends looking for mutual assistance in their romantic interests. Toradora gives its audience room to breathe and focuses the first half of the show on building the friendship between the two main characters through silly, lighthearted antics, making developed romantic feelings between characters seem more realistic and sincere later down the line when things become more serious. However, love is a complicated business, as I've said in my introduction. People's feelings do get walked over and left in the dust. While it's thematically a good thing for the audience to feel touched emotionally, seeing characters getting their emotions crushed was truly a somber sight to behold.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was smooth and was enjoyable visually. I did like the consistency that Toradora\u2019s animation offered. For a series that was done in the 2008-2009 time period, it still looks marvelous and holds its own compared to more recent anime. The sound was a big plus in my book. While I liked both the OPs and EDs, I have to give a big shout out to the timing of the music during dramatic moments; that repetitive melody of piano left quite a strong impression on me. I'd like to also address that the script and voice actors were really quite something. The dark little subtleties in comments or remarks were an admirable feature the show had to offer.\\n\\n\r\nI think every romantic series heavily depends on its cast to be the foundation of the series, holding the structure of the show into place. The characters of Toradora are an interesting bunch that create the opportunity for its audience to laugh and also feel gloomy. There is more than meets the eye underneath these seemingly clich\u00e9 characters. Ryuuji is the male lead and he is generally a very likable, realistic character. He struggles with romance, gets low self-esteem because he\u2019s self-conscious, and regularly voices his opinions on matters at hand. Throughout the show he proves that he\u2019s a loyal friend and all around good guy, though he might be a little obsessive compulsive about cleanliness and order. But hey, who doesn't have their own little quirks?\\n\\n\r\nMoving onto the main female lead, I felt a little wishy-washy in regards to liking Taiga\u2019s character. I\u2019m not a fan of the tsundere type, and that\u2019s exactly what she is. While Taiga acts like a brat most of the time, she also becomes more and more endearing as the series progresses. She stands up for herself and her friends, and despite her childish behavior, generally cares for the people around her. With the main two characters out of the way, what about the other \u2018main\u2019 characters: Minori, Yuusaku, and Ami?\\n\\n\r\nOne of Toradora\u2019s strengths was allowing the supporting characters to have their moments in the spotlight. Because of this, we are able to obtain a deeper understanding of them and paint a better picture of them as characters. While Ami and Minori seem perceptive of the relationships in the group, I\u2019m honestly not sure about Yuusaku. Under his oblivious fa\u00e7ade it\u2019s somewhat difficult to tell. While he's Ryuuji's best friend, he is oddly quite different compared to him. Yuusaku is energetic, outgoing, responsible, yet also very silly and childish. Minori seems like genuinely a nice girl with the happy on the outside clich\u00e9 personality, but Minori is really a coward underneath it all; she doesn\u2019t confront her own emotions and constantly pushes for Taiga\u2019s happiness at her own expense. It\u2019s not that I disliked Minori as a character, it was just agitating to watch her at times. Last but not least, Kawashima, Ami. Ami is the most astute of the unsaid troubles that are bothering the people in the group and often makes subtle comments or sarcastic remarks pertaining to their unspoken feelings. When she is first introduced she seems extremely stuck up and vain, but as the series progressed it becomes more apparent that she\u2019s tactfully looking out for the people she can finally call \u2018friends\u2019 for the first time. She developed the most out of the three supporting main characters, in my opinion, and easily became one of my favorite characters of the series, if not my most favorite.\\n\\n\r\nDespite how gratifying I thought the series was, I also can\u2019t turn a blind eye on the aspects of the show that I did not like. One of the most annoying tropes in anime, at least for me, is characters getting hit for no reason, or very petty ones. It's a trope that comes hand-in-hand with the tsundere character archetype, and it's one of the reasons I dislike tsundere characters as a whole. Taiga, who basically goes down the list of tsundere character traits like a check list, is a huge offender of verbally and physically abusing Ryuuji early on in the series. If you're like me, you'll find this to be quite vexing. Lastly, fan service is apparent in nearly every recent anime. While I personally dislike fan service, I know that many series utilize it to keep a portion of their audience interested. I watched Toradora because it was a romance story that set itself apart from most others. Although it's substantially toned down, comparatively to other series, I believe Toradora would have been better off not utilizing any fan service at all.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I did like the ending overall because it ties things up nicely, and felt fairly rewarding, I did not like how the ending felt very rushed. The amount of material crammed into the last couple episodes felt considerably off, considering the rest of the show was focused on coaxing the relationships at a much slower pace. A couple bad apples on a tree don\u2019t make the rest of the apples rotten, and Toradora was far from being bad. It isn\u2019t a completely perfect series, but one of the best the romance genre has to offer in anime so far.\\n\\n\r\nEvery once in a while a person can't help but wonder what if. There has been a time in all our lives when we have pondered the thought of meeting the 'one' who is exactly right for us. Every day we strive to find a person, or people, who understand and accept us for who we are. Maybe, just maybe, you\u2019ll find that one person that fits together with you like two consecutive cogs in an intricate machine. Maybe, if you were lucky, you might meet someone who is exactly right for you. It's not because this person is perfect, or because you are, but because your combined flaws fit together seamlessly in a way that allows two different beings to coexist together perfectly as equals \u2026 something like a Tiger and a Dragon.",

            "content": "Toradora! is one of the most annoying shows I have ever watched. And it has the single most ridiculous  ending of all anime I've seen. Even the ending of Claymore was more satisfying, which is saying something.\r\nIt is naturally that annoying because initially it seems to have much quality. I liked animation, music, opening, and, most importantly, I really liked most of the characters, including Taiga and Ryuuji. It is definitely quite clich\u00e9 but charming brainless high-school romance with engaging characters isn't something I automatically hate. \r\nBut, as episodes go by, all of the shows' cons start to become visible. First of all -it is too long relative to its content. Generally I'm ready to forgive Japanese for being so inept at confessing emotions, but my tolerance is limited and after over ten episodes fueled only by \"omg, I'm so Japanese, I just can't spit it out\" I'm totally fed up. Then around episode 11th Toradora experiences massive tone-shift and evolves into a soap opera without any significant comedy element. It wouldn't be a problem, but honestly it's not a very good soap opera - the dilemmas and problems seem forced for the sake of drama and easily solvable, had characters sit down and talked. As a result the entire middle part of the show feels completely unnecessary and contributes little to the main plot.\\n\\n\r\nBut still it is not tragically bad and these unnecessary middle parts may be fun for someone who likes Slice of Life genre. The real problems begin when the series after much overblown melodrama finally establishes official couple. There are many people who didn't like the pairing and preferred the other ones. For me the problem was not the pairing (because I personally preferred it over the others) but the way it was dealt with - I got the strong impression that the story on an emotional level actually justifies these other relationships better (even although I didn't like them). The final confession ends up being forced onto the couple, not only by the writers who want to rush the end, but by the other characters in-universe as well. As a result final romantic couple is not very romantic - at least one side of that pairing was literally dragged into it by external circumstances. And when one puts into consideration the fact that this forced side had all the chance to act on its own will few episodes before, yet it chose to pass, one begins to wonder what the writers had on their minds.\\n\\n\r\nStill, I wouldn't dislike the show that much. But the very last arc also turns Toradora!, already an over-exalted soap-opera, into a full-blown Bollywood movie. The only difference between the two is that Toradora manages to have even more unnecessary stupid drama than its Indian counterparts.  Characters start to behave completely at random, clearly with a goal to create as much drama as possible, without any other reason. The viewers are presented with a runaway couple (which ran away for no reason whatsoever), hasty engagement (without even sharing a single kiss beforehand), missing fathers, a few family reconciliations and the girl leaving a boy without a single a word for an extended period of time (again without a good reason). All of these serious events are introduced over the span of one and a half episode and resolved almost immediately. That was so unbelievably contrived, idiotic and poorly handled it was painful to watch. And it was absolutely not romantic. At all.\\n\\n\r\nThere is something seriously wrong with romantic comedy that manages to be ultimately neither romantic nor funny. That combined with the unbearable forced melodrama and the clumsy treatment of last six episodes sinked this show so much, I can't rate it any higher.",

            "content": "Note: this series has been dropped at episode 14\r\nUnlike the main protagonist of this anime, I do not have much strength to withstand torture. Put me in the clutches of a diabolical serial killer/torturer, and I have no idea what I\u2019d do. Ryuji, our hero, is one of a kind. Bards should sing about him in taverns all across Tamriel. For 14 episodes, he stands Taiga\u2019s relentless abuse with a smile.\r\nIn one of the greatest songs ever written, the extremely white lead singer of the Smiths sings about how it\u2019s so easy to laugh and so easy to hate. Kindness and gentleness are difficult, andI do agree with him. That said, I wonder if the band and their fanbase would change their mind if they saw the anime. Actually, considering how huge this anime is, becoming iconic in the school genre \u2013 I think they won\u2019t.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m a defender of the school genre. Many rant about how immature and derivative it is, but few people didn\u2019t go to school. A lot of things happen in school and you meet a lot of people, so it\u2019s a place rife for stories. Its low-key and stable environment actually makes it excellent for stories driven by characters. Conflicts will have to rise from within and not an external UFO coming to wreck the party. These shows rely heavily on their characters, and it\u2019s enough to have a decent, odd cast \u2013 see Haganai \u2013 to make something decent. Toradora is a major failure because of how insufferable its cast is.\\n\\n\r\nSince we\u2019re talking about symbols and not actual human beings, I need to find a way to explain why and how disgusted I was with them and how that lead me to conclude this anime is horrid crap. Many a great story are about horrible people. In fact, one of the best novels ever is about such a terrible murder. It\u2019s their darkness, their psychology and reasons for being so that makes them so intriguing. How frightening these characters are because we understand them and see us in them. Part of our obsession with villains and their backstories, or with serial killers\u2019 childhoods is because we want to know why they\u2019re like this.\\n\\n\r\nEveryone in Toradora is a bit of an asshole. Actually, only two characters are but they\u2019re so dominant that it\u2019s easy to forget about the rest. Taiga is the big problem, since she\u2019s both the main character and the worst. Tsunderes can often seem creepy, sometimes borderline Gacy-like sadistic. None of them are as bad as Taiga.\\n\\n\r\nThe archetype can be funny. Tsunderes\u2019 appeal is their insecurity, how they address the Presentation of Self in Everyday Life \u2013 we put up a front in every social interaction, putting a different front in different places. The best Tsundere, Neptunia\u2018s Noire is all about this. Humor never comes from her being violent \u2013 she\u2019s rarely is \u2013 but how hard she works on her image.\\n\\n\r\nIn contrast, Taiga is nothing but violence. She reacts to everything with violence, like a 10-year-old playing Elder Scrolls and thinking that it\u2019s supercool to kill every NPC. She may not kill anyone, let alone essential NPC\u2019s but it doesn\u2019t make it any less creepy. In every episode, she beats up people at least 5 times. Her reactions are always with force, causing clear pain to the other characters. I\u2019d expect anyone to beat her in return the first time.\\n\\n\r\nThe fact Ryuji stays there is flat-out creepy. Moreover, she treats him with pure condescension. Rarely, if ever, she addresses him in a way that\u2019s not hostile. Early in the series they make a pact to help each other, but Taiga doesn\u2019t actually help him until the middle of the series. All the episodes are about the characters doing stuff and Taiga beating people up. The anime never answers why, exactly, Ryuji puts up with so much physical abuse.\\n\\n\r\nYes, \u2018abuse\u2019 is the only word that can describes their relationship. Switch the sexes. Imagine if Ryuji was constantly beating up Taiga, calling her \u2018bitch\u2019 and so forth. It\u2019s nothing but sick. You can only watch it for so long before getting tired of this torture porn thing. Not only Taiga is violent to everyone, she also has a weird entitlement problem. She expects Ryuji to take care of her and do everything for her. She never asks, demands with the expectations that Ryuji must do it for her.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, she\u2019s nothing but a horrible person who beats up everyone but also thinks everyone owes her everything. Now, a character being a terrible human being isn\u2019t enough. How their actions are framed is important and now we get to the main problem. Taiga is framed as okay.\\n\\n\r\nA backstory occasionally rears its head, feelings of insecurity do show themselves. None of is it actually dark, none of it gives us a glimpse into a troubled psych that can only react with violence and cannot connect to people. The backstory may justify anger, but the anime never acknowledge how bad Taiga\u2019s case is. No one around her also reacts like they should. They treat her like she\u2019s a quirky friend, someone who occasionally goes off, like that friend who swears a lot. This is a person who\u2019s in desperate need of help and a lawyer. It\u2019s no longer a person having anger issues but a criminal that everyone tolerates because the plot demands it.\\n\\n\r\nSuch light framing of dark material is unforgivable. Humor doesn\u2019t have anything to do with it, but how the frame never addresses the darkness of it. Physical abuse leaves people with trauma. People react harshly to physical abuse. If people stay for a long time with a physical person, being nice to them and doing what they want it means they got issues of their own. I can\u2019t stress how dark this material is, yet the light framing is disrespectful to anyone who went through physical abuse.\\n\\n\r\nTaiga and the framing of her behavior towers over the anime, so everything else ends up pointless. No matter how hard they try, the creators frame Taiga as quirky and cute. Nothing can salvage the anime, but then again it doesn\u2019t seem they try. There isn\u2019t much in the way of stories or characters. Ryuji is like that dude from Haganai only not as hot. Somehow he manages to be perfect and eventually the center of the harem because he\u2019s nice to everyone and doesn\u2019t have wants of his own. To the anime\u2019s credit, the secondary male actually has a purpose here and he\u2019s a bit hot, but besides being a more energetic nice guy there\u2019s nothing to him.\\n\\n\r\nOther females consist of a wacky redhead who\u2019s entertaining for five episodes and then becomes tiresome. As for Ami, she\u2019s another generic asshole who\u2019s overall unpleasant without the darkness. Like Taiga, she treats people like crap but the cruelty is never meant to shock or make us reflect. Funniest thing is how the anime passes her off as sexy. Not only the characters can\u2019t drive a story, but they look bad.\\n\\n\r\nArt style is another problem the anime suffers from. No one has a distinctive look. School anime, at worst, create pleasing to look at characters. You may not experience anything profound but there is aesthetic value in the designs, in understanding human beauty. Designs don\u2019t have to break boundaries, but little touches like Sena\u2019s butterfly and deep eye color make an anime more pleasing to look at.\\n\\n\r\nToradora does nothing like this. Taiga does have a weird hairstyle, but Minori isn\u2019t memorable at all. She has huge eyes and short red hair. End description. Worse offender is Ami who is meant to be the sex symbol. To express this, they gave her a longer hair and slightly bigger breasts. Unlike shows where the characters are actually sexy, her figure isn\u2019t defined or emphasized \u2013 which is necessary if the character\u2019s beauty is important to her personality. Her hair is just long without hairstyle quirks. Look at any anime that has a character whose beauty is important and you can always spot details expressing it \u2013 just as I described Sena in the above paragraph. The designers decided to do the bare minimum.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter designs are integral to how we view them. How people look is a part of them. It doesn\u2019t mean characters should all be sexy (that\u2019s actually quite odd) but their looks should somehow find their way to their personality. If your character is meant to be beautiful, make them beautiful. Toradora is satisfied with just sending the signals, mistaking low effort for minimalism. Minimalism is when you have few details but these details are important. Ami\u2019s design and everyone else\u2019s has no effort put into it. A simplicity that has no elegance, that emphasizes no details is just a product of no effort and laziness.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe the anime drastically improves. I have a hard time believing it. Watching this anime became painful. Witnessing the abuse Taiga inflicts on everyone, and expecting to be entertained and amused by it is too much. Torture porn at least acknowledges its characters suffer even if it expects me to find entertainment in pain. This anime pretends physical abuse doesn\u2019t cause any pain. Truly, it\u2019s objectionable almost on a moral standard.\\n\\n\r\n1 abusive partners out of 5",

            "content": "Mod Edit: This review may contain spoilers.\r\nStory: Secret love, unrequited love, love triangle... So yeah... The funny thing is that the ending is given away in the beginning. This can't even be considered spoilers to say that the main characters are going to end up together. Anybody who says otherwise is just too blind to realise this. Let's take the main points of the plot. First of all, one guy, one girl, each in love with each other's best friend. Two, those two try to support each other with their love interest. In order to do that, make them spend a lot of time together.Even make them live next to each other. Give them a social outcast aura and the result is: congratulations! you got yourself a very unoriginal couple. Now this is a shame because the idea is quite realistic, only too obvious which gives you no expectations. For all I know, Ryuuji and Taiga could hold hands, cuddle, hug, kiss, have sex, get married and act like there is some distance between. Awkward since there is absolutely none. From the beginning, they were already ridiculously close to each other by living next door but no, not close enough, need to live under the same roof. Even best friends don't do that ( yeah I know, room-mates or particular situation involving money but that wasn't one of them ) so it clearly gives you an idea of their relationship.\\n\\n\r\nArt: This part pisses me off, it is so bad. Taiga is supposed to be cute... it didn't do it for me.She looks like an underdeveloped child with a big head and permanent bed hair.  Maybe it's just me but the chara design really need some work. However Ryuuji's face gets +1. Now if I just say this without evidence to back up my argument, it's just trolling. If possible, watch the fight scene between Taiga and Sumire. To avoid spoilers, well, watch it on mute and no subs... The animation is really sloppy here, whether it's the lighting, the background characters with the same face or simply character motions. The art is good only when everything is still. Sloppy sloppy sloppy.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: Too bad I didn't pay much attention, but the openings and endings were nothing spectacular or catchy. When it comes to sound, I would say that music is more important than the voice acting since most of the time, the acting is flawless, it just comes to whether or not the seiyuu's voice is appropriate to the character. In Toradora, it's the usual. The usual being flawless performance. Now for the music, the comparison might be unfair but Toradora is nothing compared to say, Clannad. I chose Clannad because no matter the scene, sad, happy or epic, it's easy to remember the themes while Toradora produces music that you hear in elevators or supermarkets. Only one stands out: Lost my Pieces. But it's just one... Not enough.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Ami saves the show a little with Minori not far behind but Taiga... Damn she pisses me off! Ryuuji is not bad but too weak to be important.\\n\r\nAmi and Minori had good scenes, good chara development. I didn't give a shit about Kitamura because he is a creepy smiling guy. Ryuuji had some changes but nothing significant. Taiga on the other hand, just got more and more annoying. She's not even a tsundere, the dere part is inexistant and replaced by retard state, otherwise she's just a plain spoiled bitch who needs to be left alone. That does it, she gets a -2 for being so unlikeable. Past the physical appearance which I don't even like one bit, she has nothing left except her execrable personnality. Now one way to sum up this show is that the side characters are more interesting than the main characters. When I say main, I mean Ryuuji and Taiga. Kitamura, Minori and Ami are side characters to me. While watching the show, I realised that I had no interest in whatever happens to Ryuuji and Taiga cause they already act like a couple. The side characters however make you want to know more about them. Creepy smiling dude Kitamura has a good reason for being like this while double face Ami and oddball Minori are kinda left out towards the end after much chara development. Bad idea. My main concern is how people perceive Taiga. She does things that makes you want to slap her really f*cking hard and shout what the f*ck is wrong with you? yet she is still described as being cute, lovely etc... That girl seriously has anger issues and they can't be justified by people calling you palmtop tiger, that's retarded. She's so rude it's not even funny. Now this might be spoilers but it sums up pretty much why I think her personality is the worst. In one scene, she learns about her unrequited love confessing to a certain girl who for specific reasons refuses to give a proper answer. This is because she's going away soon so she can't say yes yet doesn't want to lie to herself by saying no. What should Taiga do in this case? Well, nothing. For the simple reason that it doesn't concern her. Still, she goes out of her way to beat the crap out of that girl while insulting her and forcing her to say she hates the guy. I was thinking \"WTF\" the whole time. What gives her the right to beat someone up just because that person is a coward when it comes to love? If we had to beat up every person who is a coward because of love, we're doomed. Besides she's also overreacting and goes as far as insulting and hitting people for no reason. With Ryuuji, they represent the epitome of shallow people. Both of them have a crush on someone who's really popular. The reason surely is because they treat them differently from the rest of the class. If that's not being shallow. Take one guy who's a social outcast. Now take a girl who's really popular, kind, funny, pretty and easy to talk to. This one guy would probably fall in love with that girl if she goes to talk to him because he's probably thinking \"she's so nice, she talks to me while the other bastards don't even look at me, maybe she cares about me\" without realising that maybe she's just nice and talks to everybody. This describes Ryuuji and Taiga perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I was really disappointed by Toradora. At first I thought it would have nice development with the introduction of Ami but I guess not. It was dull and slow. Once you feel like there's something going to happen just push the reset button because it has the same feeling. Got some funny scenes though. Unfortunately the show is barely realistic. You don't root for development of the relationship between the characters and their crush because there's no feeling, no background story. Things would've been simpler like this:\\n\r\nRyuuji: I like Minori.\\n\r\nTaiga: Oh... I see. I like Kitamura.\\n\r\nRyuuji: !!! What!? Ok. So...\\n\r\nBoth: Wanna hang out sometimes?",

            "content": "Going into Toradora, I wasn\u2019t really expecting too much from it. I thought it would be your standard school life love story we have all seen so many times before. But low and behold it came out to be surprisingly good, and has quickly become one of my favorite 2008 airing anime series.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nThe story revolves around Ryuuji and Tiaga, two ordinary students that end up working together in order to help one another end up with the ones they love. It stays pretty true to the \"love story\" formula. What makes this anime really good is the excellent pacing it takes with the story.In many \"school life\" anime we always end up watching filler style episodes, only to have the end of the series be the only thing good about it. Not so for Toradora however! It manages to keep the anticipation between the potential couples high, all along weaving together a pretty good in depth story that really shows the heart of the characters. A lot of times we have scenes that show the characters trying to get the words out to express their feelings, and others offer more side story scenarios-- which usually end up going in conjunction with a certain character\u2019s inner turmoil and struggle. Each episode flows nicely into the next, and you get some pretty clever comedy along the way. Now that is not to say that Toradora's story is without fault; not every episode is particularity interesting as others, towards the end the story tends to drag on a bit and feel somewhat rushed, and the characters start to get in a sort of \"pity party\" mood with their situations, which can get to be a bit of a downer at times. Still though, haven\u2019t all of us been there at one point in our lives, where we really want to say what is in our hearts, but end up holding back for risk of getting hurt? Or even worse, hurting another? Overall the story is filled with enough drama and guess work to keep the audience into it! Though it should be said that hardcore romance fans may be able to predict some of the twists and turns the plot takes. It does come close to becoming a bit of a harem anime, but just never quite reaches that category. The anticipation of \"who will end up with who?\" --is the stories strongest feature, and the ending doesn't disappoint!!\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nThe art really isn\u2019t anything too special. You get a nice mixture of bright colorful characters and environments. The characters are sharp and well animated with their facial expressions, but the backgrounds can look a bit washed out at times. And some of the action scenarios can be a bit on the stiff side. Again, the character\u2019s faces are what stood out for me the most with the art, you really feel like you can read them at times.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nLike the visuals, I wouldn\u2019t go on par to say that the music can be anything more than \"appropriate.\" You do get some pretty nifty opening and closing songs, and they change mid way through the series. The BG music was nothing--if not forgettable. Even while writing this I can\u2019t really think of a piece that stood out for me. What does make the soundtrack so good however, are the character voices! All of them were matched perfectly to a \"T, \" and I could not find a single voice actor to be out of place with their role. I especially enjoyed Taiga\u2019s voice. She has this tough girl tone and attitude, yet you can tell that deep down inside she really does care about those around her. Something that the viewer will indeed discover while making their way through the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\r\nDefinitely the heart of Toradora! While going through this anime I really felt that I started a \"virtual\" style bond with them. I actually cared about the problems they had, and wanted them to end up happy in the end. Towards the beginning, viewers may find a character or two that they either dislike or even despise. But trust me when I say this: \"stick with it!\" They end up evolving and have many twits to their persona! Taiga is really the one who stole the show for me, she has so many layers to her personality that it can be hard to figure out just what is going through her head at times. A character named Minorin can be drop dead funny when she wants to be, and Ryuuji is a great guy that is always there for his friends. The best compliment I can say about the cast? They act very human (ie: realistic), maybe a bit exaggerated at times, but mix the two together very well! Which can be hard to do in an anime. My only real knock against the characters was, since there are multiple romance skits going on, at times it felt like some of them were a bit too discreet with confessing to one another; which in turn can make the story slow paced at times. I almost felt like I wanted to jump inside my computer screen and yell: \"Oh just say it already!!!\" That aside, there really isn't much to complain about, great cast! \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nDespite some of the glitches in the storyline, I still never the less found myself totally drawn into the world of Toradora! It had more than enough to offer to keep me wanting more! The mixture of comedy, romance, suspense and tender moments--really drew me in!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nToradora makes us contemplate what is more important in life; love or friendship? This anime really turned out to be a great surprise for me. Sure its got some flaws and all. But this series has it where it really counts; character chemistry and development! If you are a fan of romance anime, complimented with a great cast of characters and funny anecdotes. Then I highly recommend giving Toradora a try! It may not do anything new with its romance formula, but it does indeed do it right!",

            "content": "Toradora isn't your story that only focuses on one thing.  Well, at least I don't think so.  It conveys so much meaning to everything that is going on in life.  It shows you that sometimes, even your most important wish, the with you want to come true the most, can sometimes not be reached.  But it also shows some examples of how people decide their path and move on forward. \r\nPlease bear with me.  This is only my third time reviewing.\r\nThe story was fantastic.  Even though there are only 24 episodes, which is actually plenty, the story was welldeveloped.  There are no complaints that I can think of right now.  For example, the person you thought you loved just because of the way they act wasn't the one you loved, then comes another person who is a match for you.  That is a good plot on it's own.  That connects to what is going on in the real world.  \\n\\n\r\nThe art...  Fantastic.  You could really tell they put a lot of effort into it.  From they're facial expression, even the walking, they put a lot of effort.  Then when the animation shifts to the parts where there is violence, the animation in that part was...  Wow.  That is all I could say.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was great.  Everything, the sound effects were timed well, and the sound tracks matched perfectly with the scenes.  Although for some reason, the first ending song didn't quite get along with me.    But the rest was great.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were really the perfect match with the story.  They're slow development in each episodes connects the viewer in the story that sometimes they might think that they are them.  \\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment...  I enjoyed it very much.  It's not like romance is my highest favorite genre, but I still like it.  Especially in this one.  Also the comedy, some actions, and others were also factors of the enjoyment it brought.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this show was really great.  I only wish something like this will come in the future.",

            "content": "NOTE: This Review will be Updated every 6 episodes\r\nToradora is a highly entertaining romantic comedy that successfully escapes the cliched harem tales that dominate the genre. Although it is somewhat let down by mediocre animation and music, the original premise and unforgettable dialogue make Toradora one of the best light hearted romances  of the season.\r\nStory: 8\r\nToradora is based primarily on the interplay of Takasu and Taiga. A nice guy who has a fearsome reputation due to his aggressive looks, who makes an unlikely pact with a volatile, but cute girl, to help each other succeed with their respective crushes. This premise quite refreshing, andunlike almost all anime within the genre, the male lead is not automatically the object of affection for half a dozen girls.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the pace of the story is somewhat erratic. There are frequent episodes that seem more `slice of life', with no significant plot development. This, however, is not as bad is it seems, given that the events that do happy in each chapter are often hilarious, and well watching on their own.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\\n\r\nToradora art is not bad... not particularly good. It just does not stand out. While Taiga has a very attractive character design, some supporting characters do look rather bland. The background themselves are also serviceable, but not particularly noteworthy. There's nothing particularly wrong with Toradora's looks, its certainly comparable to that of for example, True Tears or School days. It just doesn't feature that extra level of excellence featured in Clannad or Tale of Memories.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting for the characters are well done, and definitely fit their roles. However, the OP and ending themes are rather mediocre. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\\n\r\nToradora's main strength is the personality of its cast. Rarely is there a character as unique as Aisaka and Takasu. Their personalities are not only memorable, but also multi-dimensional. While Aisaka, for example, comes across as an arrogant and demanding girl, there are rare moments where her more timid side is briefly shown.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyament: 10\\n\\n\r\nToradora is a great anime to watch, and perfect for lifting you from a foul mood. It's both funny and touching, which makes it great for short study or work breaks.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n\r\nDespite its technical flaws, Toradora is an excellent example of what a light hearted romantic comedy should be like. Despite its rather exaggerated circumstances, it features an original storyline where the cast are more than just cliches.",

            "content": "Toradora can do one thing extremely well: comedy. The characters of Toradora are completely built for playing off each other well in comedic gags. That's why I really loved the first half of Toradora. It had some of the best school comedy scenes I've seen. \r\nHowever, at the half way point, after the Culture Festival, it seems that an invisible switch was flipped for the story, where instead of focusing on comedy, the drama would be more prevalent.\r\nNow, there have been many shows that have been able to mix comedy and drama, they even form the genre of \"dramedy\", Kodocha and Clannad to only nametwo. So I know that the two can be sucessfully spliced. In Toradora's case though, the result is jarring, as the humor seemingly disappears from the show to make room for chick fights, eavesdropping, confessions, and rejections.\\n\\n\r\nThe main problem in this transition form comedy to drama is the complete 180 degree turn some of these characters do. Since they were built for comedy, the author/director needed to change them for the drama.\\n\\n\r\nMinorin is a wonderful example. She's super hyperactive and boisterous during the first half of the series. However, by the second half, when the show makes its transformation from comedy to drama, Minorin is just a shell of her character from just a few episodes prior. She broods, mopes, and loses pretty much all of her energy.\\n\\n\r\nHow am I supposed to take this story seriously when it seems like there are two different versions of the characters? I just cannot.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the boring statistical review.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10 - The first half was great because, while it included several school cliches, it found a way to be different from all its predecessors. The second half, however, was just cliche, and often convoluted, where it seemed the author just made characters fight with each other for no reason.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10 - The artwork is above average, which seems to be what J.C. Staff strives for. It's not near the level of JC's other series of the Fall, Toaru Majutsu no Index, but it definitely suffices and detail is provided when necessary. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10 - I'm a fan of the first opening/ending, but the second set are adequate as well. The BGM is unobtrusive and largely unnoticeable, but that's not really a bad thing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10 - As I said, these characters are built for comedy. Be it Ryuuji's near-OCD behavior when he happens upon a messy area or Taiga's childish demeanor whenever she sees Kitamura. They're funny. It's too bad that the characters were nearly all completely changed for the second half.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10 -  I loved the comedy in the first half, but dreaded the poor writing and inconsistency of the characters that plagued the second half. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10 - Overall, it's not bad. It's an average romantic comedy in a sea of romantic comedies.",

            "content": "Fairly enjoyable but not really cutting edge.\r\nOverall - 6/10\r\nI personally found Toradora to be somewhat enjoyable to watch but not exactly outstanding.  My biggest gripe was the use of Kugimiya Rie, coupled with J.C.Staff being the producer, which really dampened the potential impact this series.\r\nFor people not very informed, Kugimiya Rie has played the role of a tsundere with fairly similar personalities in 4 different anime works (Shana, Zero no Tsukaima, Hayate no Gotoku, Zettai Karen Children).  I liked the use of a deeper, lower tone for Taiga and I acknowledge this, but I simply found the (over) use of Rie rather stifling.\r\nStory- 6/10\\n\\n\r\nA fairly normal high school setting which sets the stage for the intriguing characters to work on.  The story is really character-driven and while the characters do a great job, the background course of events are less than stellar, like as if a B-rate movie writer did it.  The events of the Cultural Festival, and the Ski Trip were really touching, and that made me almost raise the rating to 7.  However, the pacing seems to drag on over the winter period but feels rather rushed towards the end with bits and pieces missing.  I just didn't feel really satisfied with this.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the cast and the way they transformed over the course of the series.  We get given characters with rather eccentric personalities which work nicely with everyone else.  There is good coverage of the thoughts, feelings and the transformation that occurs in the main leads and that is really pleasing to see.  I would personally liked to have seen more airtime for Ami's personality growth as she's probably the deepest person in the entire cast, and the \"answer\" to her was really rushed.  Overall a really great, and enjoyable cast.\\n\\n\r\nThe Seiyuu for Ryuuj/Nojima Hirofumi put in a solid performance but my pick of the lot is Minorin/Horie Yui who really brought up Minorin's eccentricity and hyperactivity in an excellent fashion.  My gripe with Taiga has already been mentioned.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nNothing fancy in the BGM but I really loved the OP themes.  The two OPs really conveyed the mood of the story as it changed from one to another.  The timing in which OP2 was introduced was perfect.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 6/10\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment in Toradora was closely linked with the story.  Unfortunately, despite the characters which gave me great joy worthy of an 8, the story felt really dragged out, so at the end of it all I feel it's a mildly enjoying show overall, but not one where my mind would get totally transfixed to.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation - 6/10\\n\\n\r\nFairly good and consistent.  It's no KyoAni but does the job.",

            "content": "The premise of the show is pretty hard to believe. After an accidental meeting involving two violent outbursts, Taiga Aisaka and Ryuuji Takasu make an agreement to help one another pursue their respective love interests, Kitamura and Kushieda, who also happen to be Ryuuji and Taiga's mutual friends. It's the stockholm syndrome trope, create a situation in which the two main characters are forced to spend large amounts of time together and wait for them to fall in love. High school \u2018contracts\u2019 are an object of fiction, much like the accidentally overheard conversations that drive most of the character development. People do overhear things occasionally,but when the relationship is progressed entirely through cliches, it\u2019s pretty hard to take it seriously.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, after a rocky beginning I actually began to enjoy watching Taiga and Ryuuji. Ryuuji is more functional than most adults, doing all the cooking and cleaning for his mom who comes home late from her job as a cocktail waitress and sleeps most of the day. Ryuuji finds another dependent in Taiga, whom he feeds and launders for on a daily basis. He discovers her living amongst dirty dishes and garbage after entering her unlocked apartment to wake her up and make her breakfast. What\u2019s important here is Ryuuji isn\u2019t just a caretaker to Taiga, he represents something she\u2019s never had, a person who genuinely cares about her and accepts her for who she is. He's a surrogate parent, which will be incredibly significant as we learn more of her backstory. He doesn\u2019t complain that Taiga\u2019s a mess, he just helps her pick it up and she slowly improves. This relationship does have some kind of benefit for Ryuuji as well, though it's far from ideal for him.\\n\\n\r\nHe seems to derive enjoyment from taking care of the dysfunctional Taiga, and given his relationship with his mother, who's equally bad at taking care of herself, it's very understandable that he's okay with it, he's used to it after all. But not only is their relationship is entirely one-sided, Ryuuji deals with being verbally and physically abused by Taiga constantly, aggression can definitely be attractive in a girl, but there's a difference between being aggressive and abusive. As part of their agreement, Taiga calls him a dog and commands him to do whatever she wishes... and he agrees. I guess he just really, REALLY wants Kushieda, and somehow plotting schemes with the diminutive and violent Taiga seems a better idea to him than simply talking to somebody he's already friends with. It's not like Kushieda's distant with him either, she bubbly, confident, and provides Ryuuji multiple opportunities to get closer to her, hell, they get locked in a storage room together for hours. At this point the overbearing use of cliches started to make me believe Toradora! was a satire, but given the amount of melodrama I'm pretty sure that it's takes its romance seriously. However, it\u2019s important to remember that it\u2019s Kushieda he\u2019s interested in, so it\u2019s not like the show is trying to force TaigaxRyuuji down your throat, they\u2019re simply spending time together, so Ryuuji maintaining Kushieda as a love interest helps the story feel somewhat believable, despite Taiga\u2019s abuse.\\n\\n\r\nAs the plot continues to carve its destructive path, Ami is introduced, and with her, more opportunities for \"contract\" agreements that force characters to be in the same place together despite their apparent misgivings. I'm not sure if Ryuuji is aware that he isn't legally bound by the results of immature high school contests. In any case, the writers continue to create contrived situations that force character interactions that would not otherwise happen.\\n\\n\r\nI liked both Ryuuji and Taiga, despite the unbelievable circumstances that make up their character development. I stated before Ryuuji enjoys cooking and cleaning and is very good at both of them, this detail is the precipitating factor for most of their interactions. Taiga is pretty helpless when it comes to household tasks and Ryuuji provides those services to her. Despite the horribly unrealistic circumstances I felt that Taiga and Ryuuji actually acted in reasonable ways for the most part. Taiga beats Ryuuji frequently but it's clear that she actually does like spending time with him. They're both laughably bad at pursuing their romantic interest but that's pretty typical of high schoolers so it's hardly surprising.\\n\\n\r\nKushieda is obnoxiously positive. She shares many traits with Ryuuji including domestic competence and is very hard working. I'm sure you've all encountered that person in high school who magically balanced multiple jobs, sports, and school, all while staying unusually cheery. Most of the time she was on screen I just found her really annoying, she's just WAY too positive, there is such a thing. I don't think she was necessarily a bad character, just not the type of character I liked and I wasn't remotely invested in her. I didn't care if Ryuuji made in success in pursuing her because 1. Taiga the obvious romantic interest so you know that nothing's going to happen anyway, and 2. because Ryuuji was such an idiot when it came to trying to win her over that I wanted him to fail. She also becomes the source of more forced drama later on, making it even harder to take seriously and threatening to ruin ending.\\n\\n\r\nKitamura is the man. At first you get the impression that he's the stereotypical \"obvlivious anime male highschool student\" but he has his own agenda, and it plays out in spectacular fashion. You have not seen a love confession until you\u2019ve seen Kitamura. To be fair, his arc\u2019s only purpose is to help make TaigaxRyuuji a thing, it also results in a fantastic sword fight, but he\u2019s still pretty funny to watch.\\n\\n\r\nKawashima is introduced later and is absolutely fantastic. She\u2019s far more mature than the rest of the cast due to growing up as a model in the \u201cadult\u201d world, but is stunted in some ways by her air of superiority. Her development was the best part of the show and creates some of the only believable drama between characters. Her conversations with Ryuuji are similarly realistic, they are rarely on the same page but it\u2019s clear to the audience what she\u2019s trying to tell him, which makes their interactions much easier to understand, why Kawashima finds Ryuuji interesting etc.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest mark against the show is that it\u2019s totally drowned in melodrama. Taiga overreacts in ways the get old fast, and the forced pathos ruins the genuinely emotional moments in the show. I need to emphasize this, there were truly some great emotional moments. The Christmas episode with the bear costume (you\u2019ll know it when you see it) [i]almost[/i] caused me to shed a tear, a feat that only Grave of the Fireflies is capable of, but because of the melodrama surrounding most of the show, these scenes lose their effect. Of course, there\u2019s also the incredibly contrived situations (See accidentally overheard conversations/confessions) that bring these scenes about, which doesn\u2019t help.\\n\\n\r\nThe production quality was fairly good, I liked the character designs and the animation quality was impressive at times and never bad. Nothing else about its artwork or animation stood out but that\u2019s not terrible in a romcom. The OST was kind of forgettable but does add a lot to the emotion in certain scenes and I wasn\u2019t a fan of the OP/EDs.\\n\\n\r\nToradora! certainly isn\u2019t bad. Despite its issues it delivers an heartfelt romance with well-defined characters, but the frustration with its asinine story telling was enough to outweigh most of the positive aspects. If you like melodrama, you\u2019ll probably like Toradora!.\\n\\n\r\nOne final note, the ending is talked about incessantly, and it is very good. Many complain that it was rushed and didn't explain things well enough, but if you pay attention to the character\u2019s values and motivations, you shouldn\u2019t need the writers to spoon feed you Taiga\u2019s reasons for why she did what she did. Just make sure you watch the last episode all the way through, past the credits and everything.\\n",

            "content": "It seems JC Staff loves to makes animes out of light novel publications from ASCII Media Works. Toradora! is one of their newest adaptations, and in the genre of romance/comedy that has been overdone extensively already, I am pleased to say that this anime has exceeded my expectations greatly.\r\nStory: There is nothing extraodinary about the story in Toradora, I dare say its a cliched scenario of the 2 main characters being together for all the series to find out in the end they love each other. However the way Toradora excecutes and delivers this story was done so well that even if the outcomes andevents looked predictable, it would still keep you on your toes and make you want more.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: This anime's strong point was not on the visual department, however it was still well animated and throughout the show we would be treated to a very rich and colorful anime that was pleasing to the eyes.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: Toradora proves that you dont need an awesome soundtrack to make an anime sound fantastic. Apart from a couple of tunes from the OST, there is really no standout songs in the show. However the songs are used so well in the anime they are able to really enhance the enjoyment of important scenes, making the show much more enjoyable. Also very solid voice acting, as expected from a top class voice actress as Kugimiya Rie but I was also highly impressed with Majima Junji's role as Ryuuji. Perfectly excecuted.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: This is by far the show's best aspect. Not every anime is able to deliver such likeable characters and make them blend together so well. Throughout the series I was in constant debate on which of the main heroines I liked most, because the anime manages to develop every character so well. Even the supporting characters are very likeable, and are well developed in this show. And to my surprise, for this genre of anime the show managed to deliver a main male lead that I did not find a complete idiot.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Man this show has been a blast to watch, every week I would go thinking they couldnt top last week's episode yet they still managed to do it almost every time. This is definitely one of my new favourites animes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: In the romance/comedy category, it is very easy for an anime to fall into the \"overdone\" category, despite all that, Toradora is able to keep a refreshing and interesting pace for most of its run and for that I salute JC Staff for this brilliant adaptation to a great novel. This anime proves that even if you dont have a groundbreaking plot, if you are able to provide an excellent execution with what you have you can still produce a top quality anime. If you are looking for a great romcom that is able to set itself apart from others and is able to maintain a great level of entertainment and quality, then I am sure Toradora will not disappoint you and I highly recommend it to anyone.\\n",

            "content": "\u201cIf you trip while running down a hallway, you\u2019ll get a nosebleed. If you trip in life, you\u2019ll cry.  \r\nMinori Kushieda Toradora.\r\nToradora is a special anime for me. It was not of the two anime that introduced me to the rom-com genre back in 2012 the other one being Clannad but it was the first romcom anime that I ever loved. I loved it so much that when I eventually started to buy animes DVDs back in 2015 Toradora was the third anime I purchased. From that point on I re-watched Toradora least 2 to 3 times per year and I still love iteven if it had some flaws that I started to notice on my last re-watch of it. Now unlike Clannad where my opinion of that show worst as years went on to a point, I haven\u2019t touched my Season 1 and After Story DVD sets for almost a year thanks to me having a low value of the series due to it serious killing flaws. My opinion on Toradora has stayed positive to this day despite its minor flaws I still think Toradora is the best modern romcom anime to ever come out.\\n\r\nSo what made Toradora so special.\\n\r\nWhy do I still love this show to this day?\\n\r\nWell let's find out, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nThe story follows Ryuji Takasu who is getting ready for his second year at high school. Despite being an overall nice guy he has a mistaking reputation for looking like a delinquent thanks to he evil looking eyes as well as his facial structure looking like a young yakuza member rather than a high school student. His best friend Yuusaku as well his crush Minori (whom he is too bashful to approach) are the only two people who actually don\u2019t mind his evil looking eye appearance. Soon by complete accident, he bumps into a main female lead and tsundere Taiga Aisaka aka the Palmtop Tiger.\\n\\n\r\nAfter an accidental first encounter that ends with Taiga KO-ing him in the face, Ryuuji finds out at the end of the school day that Taiga has put a love letter to Kitamura (whom she has a crush on but is too bashful to approach) in his bag by accident. This leads to Taiga breaking into his house that night to retrieve the letter by killing him with a bamboo sword only to discover that she forgot to put the letter in the envelope and has inadvertently outed her crush on Kitamura to Ryuuji.\\n\r\nAfter much ado and a few sword-blows, Ryuuji and Taiga strike a tenuous deal to use their positions as The Best Friends to help each other bag their respective crushes.\\n\\n\r\nNow the story of Toradora may be very simple in nature but the execution is downright amazing.\\n\r\nRight out the bat, the show makes a great first impression as the first episode does a wonderful job at establishing the setting, tone, characters, and themes of the show. The show also knows what it wants as it says true to its roots as a slice of life, drama romcom series without being something that is not.\\n\r\nThe show does a brilliant job of exploring the themes and topics of running away, true love, being your true self, breaking your shell and it does them all great.\\n\r\nThe show also does a great job at keeping the audience with all the story events that happen in the show by having great writing and for the most part great overall pacing.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Toradora are all fantastic.\\n\r\nRyuji is a great male lead. He may appear as this generic delinquent who hates everyone with that Yakuza look but he\u2019s actually a nice and friendly guy who care for others. He also an obsessive neat freak where he doesn\u2019t like messy houses and he would go out of his way to clean everything that he can. The best example of this was when Ryuji enters Taiga house for the first time. Despite Ryuiji having great personality traits he\u2019s is a well-developed character who has great character chemistry with the cast especially Taiga.\\n\\n\r\nTaiga despite being the queen of tsundere is actually a pretty great character. From start to finish I liked her character development as her interactions towards the rest of the cast. She may appear as this Lousie and Shana but unlike Lousie and at times Shana where they are tsundere for the sake for it Taiga\u2019s tsundere behaviour rarely mirror her true feelings.\\n\r\nShe may not be for everyone but if you can pass her tsundere side you will start to see how humanly flawed Taiga is as a person.\\n\\n\r\nIf I had to pick my favourite character in Toradora it would be Minori. \\n\r\nShe is a sweet and upbeat person who loves to keep everybody happy but there\u2019s a lot than that. In order for her to cope with own internal struggles and loneliness, she plays softball as well as working on a series of part-time jobs. Her character development in the series was great and I really loved every scene that she\u2019s was in. Overall brilliant character.\\n\\n\r\nNow we have Kitamura Taiga crush and Ryuji best friend. Not gonna lie I thought I Kitamaru was pretty bland in the beginning as he just came as this typical smart guy chararters. Thankfully he does become a much better character as the series as he had a great character arc that was well told and it had a satisfying conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, we have Ami who is a childhood friend of Kitamura who before transferring schools, she was a fashion designer. \\n\r\nShe may start off as this typical fan-service character but there is much more to her. In school, she plays a facade where she behaves as this cute and ditzy girl but she\u2019s actually a mean and spoiled bitch. I honestly really loved this character. She\u2019s probably my second favourite character in the show only losing to Minori. She is just is a joy to watch every-time she was on screen especially in the end of her character arc where she confronts the guy who takes pictures of her by smashing his camera while giving that devious look to him.\\n\\n\r\nThe side characters are good for what they were but apart from Yuri and Sumire the side characters are not as memorable as the mains.\\n\\n\r\nI could go on and on how great this anime is sadly I have to talk about the show\u2019s flaws because there are only two of them.\\n\\n\r\nFor starters, I didn\u2019t like the portrayal of Ryuji mom where she doesn\u2019t really behave an adult figure where instead of being a prideful or strick mother she often behaves like a kid who lazy and constantly have parties while the child always picks up all the things for them. Am not saying that Adults cannot have any fun whatsoever because I believe that all adults should have fun when are not working but Ryuji mother doesn\u2019t feel like a responsible mother at all. As much I liked how Ryuji mother aspects Taiga as a family member she doesn\u2019t really set any rules or do anything that a mother should do.\\n\\n\r\nThe second and final minor flaw is its predictable nature. Personally, I don\u2019t mind if a show is predictable in nature because as long if it\u2019s written well I can completely ignore its predictable nature and thankfully Toradora, for the most part, is a great ride that I enjoyed even it\u2019s predictable. However if you a person who is not a fan of predictable stories than this show will most likely won\u2019t like this show especially when certain scenes in Toradora actually highlight the end of the show before you even get there.\\n\\n\r\nOther than the two minor flaws which I just mentioned the story and characters in Toradora was amazing.\\n\\n\r\nJ.C Staff is known to have great art in the shows that the make and Toradora is no different.\\n\r\nThe background scenery is very appealing to look at thanks to smooth soft colour pallet. The charterers for both the main and supporting were aagreat looking.\\n\r\nAs for the actual animation itself, I thought it was very good and well handled. Sure the beginning the animation is basic stuff but when we get to the actual action and emotional scenes of the series the animation really shines. The best examples of this were Taiga vs Sumire fight in episode 16 to Taiga emotional breakdown in episode 19.\\n\r\nFantastic job J.C Staff\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for Toradora is fantastic and nicely composed. I know not many people were a not fan of the soundtrack and I can understand they are coming from but I thought the soundtrack for Toradora was well made as it perfectly captures the tone and setting of Toradora perfectly. One of the song track Lost my Pieces from Toradora is not only my favourite track from Toradora but it\u2019s also my second favourite track piece from a romance only losing to Always be With You from Kodocha.\\n\\n\r\nSome of my other favourite tracks include Startup, Magic of Love, Morning Glory, Happy Monday and Ready Steady Go. They are just brilliant tracks overall.\\n\\n\r\nAll the opening and endings themes in Toradora are great in their own ways and they are extremely catchy.\\n\\n\r\nNow for sub vs dub.\\n\r\nI only saw the sub twice back in 2012 but I remember it being great filled with talented Seiyuus. However, as soon as I put in DVD disc one for Toradora as well watching the first couple of episodes dubbed I immediately decided to never touch the sub again. Don\u2019t get me wrong the sub is great but the dub was a special case of awesomeness. Out of all the romcom anime that I have seen Toradora has the best English dub that I have seen from a romcom anime. I was blown away by how awesome the dub was as every single voice actor and I mean every single one did a fantastic job voicing their respective characters. The one thing that the Toradora dub had over the sub is how realistic the acting was. Just a well-made and directed dub overall.\\n\\n\r\nToradora is a perfect example of a modern romcom anime done right. The story is well written, theme exploration is masterful, the characters are wonderful in their own ways, the visuals were nice, the soundtrack was great and the English dub was perfect.\\n\\n\r\nToradora is not only the best modern romcom anime to ever come out it\u2019s but it\u2019s also my third favourite romcom anime period. The show may not be for everyone but for those who adored the series such we can get past its predictable nature and flaws we see a show that is beautiful and heartwarming.\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re looking for a great romcom anime that has great characters and amazing themes exploration then I recommend Toradora.\\n\r\nIt is a anime that will forerver stay in my elite four of romcom anime.",

Both Taiga and Ryuj are unable to convey their feelings to the person they have feeling for. Therefore, they team up and try to fix their problems together. As if that isn't enough, a secretive demon like actress is thrown into the mix. Many hilarious and troubling events take place so that you end up falling in love with Toradora before it ends. It's cute, a good laugh, and well animated. In every category it's avery enjoyable watch! I'd recommend it to everyone that likes a high school story about love and life.\\n\\n\r\nSo why the low score? Let's just say, I despised the ending. In order to keep from revealing anything, I won't say why. I loved the show up till the end of episode 19. Certain events took place that made me hate the show with a burning passion. That doesn't stop me from suggesting it to everyone else though. Most people liked it, and I bet you will too!",

            "content": "I'll keep this short and simple. Screw this anime.\r\nSound and art are fine. Not really too detailed art with a little bit of comedy sketches. The sound matches well with the series which would give it a higher score if the series was good.\r\nNow the reason why this series sucks. TAIGA IS A GIANT BITCH. That should be tazered and thrown into Mount Doom. I get the appeal of Tsundere which is the demographic for this show. Taiga is the completely horrible side of Tsundere. Tsundere are supposed to be a tale of two sides with a harsh side balancing a hidden sweet side. IFthe harsh side is a psychopath I don't give a damn if there is a sweet side. I don't even need to go past the first episode to prove that this girl is certifiable. She breaks into the protagonist's home, illegal, assaults him with a deadly weapon, illegal, damages his property, illegal, and then extorts him to get her to leave, illegal.\\n\\n\r\nPeople in the anime world, abuse isn't fine if it's female on male. It's one thing if it's a single hit or insult every once in awhile but Taiga does this abuse constantly. It makes her completely unlikable for anyone who has dealt with abuse before and can't just laugh off a shit character. The easiest way to see if it hits the double standard is flip the genders. This becomes a freaking black comedy/horror if you switch the protagonist's genders.\\n\\n\r\nI get the reason why people laugh at pain. Watching a drunk guy on youtube fall over himself and try to base jump off his roof is pretty damn funny. What I don't get is why anyone would willingly hang out with a person that makes your life hell by insulting and hurting you all the time. \\n\\n\r\nAny story that would try and portray a character like that as lead heroine role needs to be burned with fire. I would give this anime a zero but watching Taiga get her karmic justice raises the score. 2 out of 10 Recommendation: Put it on a rocket ship, fly it out to unknown coordinates, and hyper beam it into oblivion. The perfect example of how NOT to make a Tsundere lead in a romantic comedy (Her and Louise Valliere of Familiar of Zero).",

            "content": "When you think of a romance, comedy, school life/slice of life, you think about an anime with two (or more) lovers as they go through thick and thin together. That certainly does not fit the description of Toradora!. In fact, I don't think anything is able to describe just how funny, touching, deep, and serious Toradora! is. \r\nI started watching Toradora! after reading the first few chapters of the manga. At first, I thought it was one of those series focusing purely on romance and comedy. I thought it was a carefree series that will bring watchers some laughs with some moments of romance. Thefirst few episodes did seem to be leaning toward this direction. However, as the story develops, I was blown away. The story and characters were so complex, fascinating, and unique that the description of a \"carefree comedy romance anime\" just can't fit Toradora!. Not at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe story, at its introduction, is simple. Takasu Ryuuji and Aisaka Taiga both have crushes on the other's friend. They decide to help each other. Really simple, and predictable right? Nope. As the story propels forward, so many wild and heartwarming events occur make the relationships between the friends not so clear. The story moves along a very smooth pace as well. Like other comedy/romance anime, Toradora! develops the story w/ episodic events. Unlike the others however, it blends the main plot and each event very well, so that you'll never see just an event (such as a house party or summer trip) that's just there for enjoyment. In Toradora!, the events drive the story, not the other way around.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes the story so much exciting, unpredictable, and anticipated are the wonderful characters of Toradora!. At the onset, the characters are introduced, and each have an obvious trait/personality that you have no problem identifying. Takasu is mean-looking and scares people, but he really is the ideal guy: nice, reliable, friendly. Kushieda Minori is the cheerful girl and Aisaka's best friend who is always energized and lighting up the mood. However, there is so much more than just that. As the story progresses, the characters do as well. Each character faces trials and obstacles in the story. As a result, they develop, change, and gradually become different. In addition, each character has inner feelings and pasts that influence their way of dealing with things. \\n\\n\r\nAs you watch each episode, the main cast is so well created that you'll forget they're just figures of fiction. You will treat them as real beings, sympathizing with one and perhaps disapproving another. Your own feelings will change as the characters change. All of this leads to a wonderful experience that is Toradora!.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is well drawn. Backgrounds are clear, colorful, and sharp. Character movement is smooth. The sound is rendered and timed perfectly. Each background song/sound fits with the scene, and adds strength to it. The opening and ending songs are also very well chosen, perfectly fitting with the general theme of Toradora!.\\n\\n\r\nI have greatly enjoyed Toradora!. I had average expectations and saw some potential in Toradora! when I started watching it in Oct. 08, when the Fall 2008 season came out. Unlike so many other anime that start with great beginning but only to degenerate, Toradora! shot through the roof of mediocrity with its great characters and story. It satisfied many viewers and went on to become even better as each week passed. Now that I've seen all 25 episodes, I must say, it was an incredible series.",

            "content": "Toradora is based off of some romantic comedy light novels written by Takemiya Yuyuko. From October '08 to March '09, an anime adaptation aired. It was brought to us by J.C. Staff, the same studio behind Shakugan no Shana, Yami no Matsuei & Hachimitsu to Clover. So, this could be terrible, really good or bland, based on that. The anime version's writer doesn't help narrow things down either. It was handled by Okada Mari. She's worked on such anime as Canaan & Kuroshitsuji II. So, let's take a  look and see if this is one of J.C's better works, or at least entertainingly badlike their work on Garzey no Tsubasa. \\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nRyuuji  has romantic feelings for his classmate, Kushieda. Kushieda's best friend, Taiga, has a crush on Ryuuji's best friend, Kitamura. A fact that Ryuuji learns when she mistakenly leaves  love letter in his bag. Ryuuji and Taiga become friends, planning to help one another in order to make their romantic dreams come true. Next stop, shenanigans. \\n\\n\r\nThe biggest flaw with the series is that its relatively unique set up for a rom-com becomes progressively more clich\u00e9d and predictable as the series progresses. In fact, a lot of you will be able to guess how the series ends just from applying romantic comedy logic to that short description. It's a shame because the early stuff can be fairly amusing. The series also has its share of always so \u201cwonderful\u201d jokes about a girl hitting a guy. Although, in all fairness, they aren't as prevalent in Toradora as they are in certain other series. The main romance is also quite bad with a convoluted love... heptagon... no, hexagon and with several overly melodramatic moments leading up to it.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the positives. To reiterate, the early episodes are pretty entertaining and there are some genuinely funny moments in there with clever set ups and good pay offs. Seeing Ryuuji and Taiga try to help one another leads to quite a few good jokes. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this aren't particularly complex, but they're perfectly functional for a comedic series and most of the main cast get their share of good comedic moments. Where the series really excels is with the developing friendship between Ryuuji and Taiga early on. Although, the series sets about ruining it in the second half. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in this is pretty good. Granted, they don't have to do much with it since most of the series takes place in a rather generic townscape and at a rather generic school, but it has some strong details and the characters do look unique. The series also has some success at using lighting to set the mood at various points. It's a nice little detail. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThey got some good actors for this series. Kugimiya Rie, Majima Junji, Horie Yui, Nojima Hirofumi & Kitamura Eri are all fine actors. I won't claim that Toradora shows any of them at their absolute best, but there's enough for them to work with that they can show their skills. The music is pretty mediocre. There's nothing that really sets it apart from the music of any other romantic comedy. \\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nThere are points in the story where it definitely seems like Kushieda has feelings beyond friendship for Taiga. But as the series continues and becomes more trite, it becomes apparent that that isn't the case. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nToradora is a series with a strong start. In the beginning, it has a lot going for it. A legitimately different premise. Some strong comedic scenes. A good dynamic betwixt Ryuuji and Taiga. However, as the series progresses it gradually eliminates all of that. It tosses  it away to make things, to be completely frank, boring and generic. Instead of taking some risks, Takemiya decides to play it the safe, dull route we've seen in every romantic comedy ever made. As a result, the series squanders its early good will and ends things on a disappointing note. I sill wouldn't call it a bad series but I would say it ends up being as mediocre as Hachimitsu to Clover. My final rating is a 5/10. If you really like the standard rom-com clich\u00e9s, you'll probably like it throughout. If you want something unique in any way you'll spend the first half of the series thinking \u201cthis could work if they don't decide to bog it down with obvious clich\u00e9s\u201d and the second half pressing your palm against your face a lot. Next week I'll look at Sword Art Online II.",

            "content": "Toradora .. it is considered one of the best romance anime of all time .. well i disagree. I only saw a couple of romances and i already saw 3 romances that for me were better than Toradora. \r\nWhy this anime for me is over rated? Well it has nothing special to offer .. pretty usual, pretty normal, the romance is predictable, well nothing here excels in my opinion. \r\nStory: 7/10. I only gave a 7 to the story because we have a interesting way of starting an anime. The rest ? Clich\u00ea. Everything ! Not even one character is original, everyone are clich\u00ea andnot even one is interesting. I kinda guessed the end when i was in the 4th ep or so .. and I did it right, the end was just what I expected to be ... why is that? BECAUSE IT'S A ********* clich\u00ea and like every clich\u00ea out there, they are predictable and boring. But still the story is good enough.. there is no plot holes, everything fits right. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10. Really really crappy art. The characters look ugly.. it seems that they just changed the size of the boobs, the hair colour and the eyes colour between the female characters. Look on the web and see if i'm not right. There is even 2 characters that i just could distinguish by hearing their voices... -.-. The background is also pretty bad. But .. the design i think it's well done after all and fits well with the character's personality. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10. Actually the best aspect here. It makes the comedy moments much more fun. The voice acting is pretty good also. The openings are funny especially the first one. About the OST, they fit nice and i found no problems on them .. Although the OST for the drama could be better .. it's pretty smooth for me xD \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10. Like i said they all are clich\u00ea characters .. predictable movements, predictable choices, predictable reactions .. where is the fun watching this? But i do have to say they have a nice development, all of them have a different personality and it's interesting seeing the interaction between the characters. But again, they are clich\u00eas so as their background stories. I was having a deja'vu every time they explained some character's past. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10. It is a clich\u00ea .. but at least it's funny to watch and entertains well. Although .. because i already had predicted the end, the romane got extremely weak for me, and it looked pretty rough, i mean at least i don\u00b4t like that type of romance. I'm one of those who likes cute things. I can\u00b4t lie to you, i saw this anime in 3 days so i had fun while i was watching that's for sure. But it's because it is a comedy show with some drama on it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10. I'm being generous giving this anime a 7/10. I like to get suprised and here i got everything right. To much predictable, at least for me it sucks. Although for a comedy is nice, for a slice of life is also good. But i advise you, if you heard the same as i \"Toradora is one of the best romances of all time\" .. IT'S WRONG. For me, it was just a normal romance, so it can\u00b4t be the best. So don\u00b4t get hype for then get disappointment like i had. \\n\\n\r\nIf you like romance/comedy/slice of life, this is a good show .. but not one of the best romance animes. It just looks pretty normal to be one of the best.",

            "content": "Romantic Comedies are some of the most common stories in modern entertainment, there never seems to be a shortage of them. Naturally, the genre can often be stale, relying on the same old tired formula over and over again. Some try to change things up with peculiar or supernatural circumstances, but more often than not just come off gimmicky. But every once in a while a really good romantic comedy comes out that reminds people of the value of the genre. Toradora is definitely one of these.\r\nThe story follows two high school misfits, Ryuji Takasu and Taiga Aisaka, and their developing friendship. Ryuji is misunderstoodby his schoolmates because of his intimidating appearance; in reality he is actually responsible nice guy (albeit certainly not a social butterfly). Taiga, on the other hand, despite her petite appearance is a real trouble child. She has a fierce and anti-social demeanor, and does not hesitate to put a beating to anyone who crosses her. These two are brought together because each has a crush on the other's best friend. They make an agreement to help one another win the hearts of their respective crushes. However, this is a lot harder done than said, as neither really has a clue about relationships. At the same time, they begin to find comfort in their makeshift friendship.\\n\\n\r\nAdmittedly, there is not anything particularly special about this set-up, and the story is actually quite predictable. You would have to be blind not to see how it ends from the moment Taiga and Ryuji meet. The funny thing is, though, none of that really matters. The real joy of Toradora lies in its presentation. Where other romantic comedies might rely on a quick gimmick to distinguish themselves from their kin, Toradora does not. What it does rely on, refreshingly enough, is quality writing and strong characterization.\\n\\n\r\nToradora has a nice balance of comedy and drama. The show can have you laughing one moment, then knock you down with hard hitting emotion the next. Silly misunderstandings, romantic rivalries, and other traits of the genre are utilized to develop characters in unexpected ways. Take for example the swimming contest between Taiga and her then rival Ami. It provided plenty of comedic moments that were amusing on their own, but also created a situation that further deepens Taiga and Ryuji's relationship as well. The way Toradora squeezes in character development at every opportunity is the key to its success. It turns what would otherwise be standard romantic comedy and school-life fair into something special.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves, at first appearance, look like little more than a collection of tropes. Taiga is clearly a tsundere from the moment she appears, and there is not much that separates Ryuji from other protagonists. Taiga's best friend (Ryuji's crush) Minori is a hyperactive athlete; Ryuji's best friend (Taiga's crush) is an odd but popular student council member; and transfer student Ami serves as a rival to the tiny Taiga. Though they do not seem like anything special at first, they develop into well-rounded believable characters as the story progresses. Taiga's violent disposition becomes understandable as her numerous family problems are revealed; her tsudere tendencies are utilized convincingly to portray her as an aggressively guarded teenage girl. As energetic and weird as Minori is, she is more than just comedic relief, her hyperactive demeanor hides surprising depth. The two-faced Ami can come off as a bitch, but also has a side that is a sympathetic, and is remarkably well developed and interesting all on her own. While not as colorful in personality as the girls, Ryuji is an endearing lead whose presence never becomes bothersome. The rest of the cast is equally as likeable, though none shine as bright as the main cast.\\n\\n\r\nBeing in the slice-of-life genre, it is easy what to expect from Toradora visually. However, even here, the show delivers exceptionally well. Character designs are quite attractive; even though they are not particularly unconventional, there is a certain flair to them. The body language and facial expressions of each character is what brings them to life visually. Simlpy by the way they carry themselves and the way they move, it is easy to get a feel of who these characters are. Facial expressions are pivotal in conveying emotion, and it is clear Toradora's animators knew this, as they carefully handled the characters' exceptionally expressive faces to carry the subtlest of emotion.\\n\\n\r\nNot to be outdone, the show's soundtrack is equally as impressive, if not even more so. While again not unconventional in the realm of slice-of-life anime, the music is magnificently composed. From the bubbly electrical pieces used in everyday school life scenes, to the fully orchestrated ones used in the show's emotional climaxes, every beat is a joy to listen to. This music is used masterfully, fitting the tone of every scene perfectly; becoming engraved with the emotion each contained. Even the transition into the charming J-pop ending themes is incredibly well done and memorable.\\n\\n\r\nIt is apparent that Toradora is not so much groundbreaking as it is incredibly well executed. It does not do anything especially innovative with its narrative, in fact, utilizing genre conventions. However, at the end of the day, such criticisms pale in comparison overwhelming merits of the show. It is inviting, funny, heartfelt, and overflowing with emotion. It easily stands proud among the best of its genre.\\n\\n",

            "content": "In this world, there\u2019s this thing that no one\u2019s ever seen.  This thing is very kind and gentle.  And if anyone could actually see it, there\u2019d be a whole bunch of people wanting to have it.  Maybe that\u2019s why the world keeps it hidden from everyone...  Because if it\u2019s that hard to get, that makes it even more special.  And one day, someone will find it.  Whoever does find it, they\u2019ll be the one that was supposed to.  Because that\u2019s the way it\u2019s meant to be.\r\nRyuji Takesu is trying to find this something...  He\u2019s in love withan energetic girl in his class, but his reputation as the second scariest student in the school has kept him at a distance from her.  One day, the first scariest student in the school slips a love note into his bag by mistake, and the two of them realize that they\u2019re in love with each others\u2019 best friends.  By joining forces in the pursuit of their unrequited loves, can this tiger and dragon finally find that one thing that they long to see?\\n\\n\r\nWell, once again, we\u2019re returning to JC Staff, although this series is an entirely different creature than the two shows I\u2019ve reviewed before.  It combines the budget allocation from Ghost Hunt with the hyper-cheap aesthetic from Ookami-san to some surprisingly great effect.  It\u2019s not what you\u2019d call a great looking series, as movement is limited, but for the most part, the movement it DOES showcase is smooth and kinetic.  The only time it really becomes ugly is during a few of the biggest emotional moments of the show, and their attempt to get as much movement as possible out of the characters leads to frameless, poorly drawn monsters that look absolutely hilarious when paused.  But luckily, those moments are few and far between, and the high emotions involved are enough to overpower and revulsion these images may cause.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the artwork, it\u2019s above average.  The character designs are brilliant, with inspired looks and bright, sharp color choices keeping the entire cast fresh in your mind for days after you finish the series, but outside of that, it\u2019s pretty standard slice-of-life stuff.  The CG, at least in the few moments that they choose to employ it, is flawlessly done, so it\u2019s pretty easy to pick out where a good chunk of the budget went.  The only aspect of the artwork that really bothered me were the constant jagged outlines around the characters, which is not an uncommon problem in anime from around the late aughts...  Even Brotherhood and Spice and Wolf suffered from it.  That problem is completely erased if you\u2019re watching it on Blu-ray, however.\\n\\n\r\nIn any case, the show does it\u2019s job visually, as all the extra effort in the animation makes for some impeccable comic timing, and the lighting and color scheme suddenly become gorgeous whenever there\u2019s a romantic scene to showcase.  The facial expressions are detailed and dynamic enough to make Kyoto Animation eat it\u2019s heart out, which is important because in a lot of ways, the characters are the most important part of the show.  The main characters... The ones who appear most prominently in the opening...  Take the standard love triangle and evolve it into a full blown love pentagon, with enough plotting and emotional nuance that each one of them is as important to the unfolding drama as the next.  \\n\\n\r\nOur central character, Ryuji Takesu, is a hopeless romantic who\u2019s been mistaken for a scary thug because of his tough face and quiet demeanor.  If that sounds familiar to you, it\u2019s because his character was ripped off wholesale by a series that I like to call \u201cHaganai: I Don\u2019t Have Many Original Ideas.\u201d  He\u2019s the standard nice guy rom-com lead, but there\u2019s more to him than others of his ilk...  He was raised by a very childish single parent, which lead to him becoming the responsible housewife she could never be...  He cooks, fusses, and is an obsessive neat-freak who can\u2019t stand to let dirt or mold sit unchallenged.  His personality may not resonate with everyone, but that\u2019s what\u2019s so wonderful about it...  He actually has personality traits that aren\u2019t just positive gimmicks, and the majority of the people surrounding him actually DO find him weird because of it.  He\u2019s not the glorified perfect guy everyone loves, and after Kyo-Ani\u2019s domination of the market, that\u2019s pretty refreshing.\\n\\n\r\nThe other main character is Taiga Aisaka, a tiny girl who\u2019s actually earned her frightful reputation.  Blunt and brutal, she\u2019s been given the diminutive nickname \u201cThe Palmtop Tiger.\u201d  At first glance, she may appear to be some calculated pander to the fans of the lolicon and tsundere archetypes, and I can kind of understand where people who say this are coming from.  But as the story progresses, and you learn more about her family situation, her tough nature becomes more and more understandable, and it also becomes very clear that her physical shortcomings are a thing that she has to overcompensate for.  Yeah, you can condemn her as being a shallow grab at the loli market, but the truth is, I knew plenty of girls like her in school, so it\u2019s hard for me to become offended when one of them is very accurately represented in a story.  She\u2019s the most complex and (ironically) the most developed character in the cast, so it makes sense that she\u2019s become the posterchild for the series.\\n\\n\r\nTheir friends(and initial love interests) are Yusaku Kitamura and Minori Kushieda, two lovable oddballs who are active in a lot of school activities.  Yusaku is a relatively simple character, and in the beginning, he\u2019s the only one who knows that Taiga and Ryuji are good people.  This probably has something to do with his involvement in student council, as he seems to be the kind of person who makes an effort to get to know everybody.  Despite being a little simple, he does have his problems, and he does get his own arc, and they don\u2019t disappoint.  Minori is the class\u2019s genki girl, a bright ball of energy who tries her best in everything she does, is highly perceptive of other peoples\u2019 true feelings, and holds about a dozen jobs outside of school.  She can be annoying to some viewers, but while it\u2019s never fully explored, it\u2019s implied several times throughout the anime that she has a wealth of issues below the surface, and that she may secretly suffer from poverty, or even severe depression in her home life.  Whatever the case, the only ones who never really believe in her sunny exterior are herself and...\\n\\n\r\nMy favorite character in the show, Ami Kawashima.  When she\u2019s introduced to the story, it\u2019s as a sort of villain...  Or, at least, an antagonist.  She\u2019s a bratty, arrogant model who puts on a much more manufactured, moe-like facade in order to manipulate people, and if you\u2019re the kind of person who can\u2019t stand all the infantilized doe-eyed ladies of the Key Trinity, you\u2019ll be laughing right along with her over it.  As she develops, and we learn more about why she transferred to this school and why she is the way she is, she\u2019s eventually forced to drop her act, at which point she becomes arguably the most important character in the series. She becomes an almost Shakespearian character, a fifth wheel who\u2019s free to observe the web of lies going on between her cast mates.  She takes an active role in the story, pulling strings and making calculated comments, getting way too involved as she tries to unravel the truth behind it all.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast is used with surprising efficiency, as none of them are featured any more or less than they need to be.  Characters like The Student council President, Inko the brain-damaged parrot, and the parents of our two central characters exist not only to augment the comedy or drama of the material, but to drop subtle hints about why the characters are the way they are.  Characters like Miss Koigakubo and four other select students exist to deliver some stunning paralells in regards to what\u2019s going on in the main story, as well as to serve as a constant reminder that there\u2019s a world outside of Taiga's circle.  \\n\\n\r\nToradora is one of a small list of shows that I\u2019ve seen in both English and Japanese, and even though I may be woefully monolingual, I can personally attest to the fact that both tracks are nothing short of pure gold.  I can\u2019t really say anything about the Japanese track that a simple list of names wouldn\u2019t say all on it\u2019s own, as I don\u2019t think anybody is a virgin to the works of people like Rie Kugimiya and Yui Horie, but the English dub really doesn\u2019t have that kind of star power, so it does merit a bit more discussion.\\n\\n\r\nIn recent years, Bang Zoom Entertainment has taken to pushing it\u2019s main stable to the back row, and instead giving some of it\u2019s best roles to a series of newer actors that haven\u2019t gotten nearly as much work in the past.  This transition was a little rocky at first, with projects like K-On and Oblivion Island at the forefront, and some decent yet rather awkward acting in Madoka Magica.  Well, Toradora was their moment, and they rose to it, putting forth better performances than I could have possibly imagined.  They all far surpassed the relatively little work they\u2019ve previously done, and after hearing them in this, I sincerely hope this stable becomes the next big industry powerhouse.  \\n\\n\r\nGoing in, I already  had respect for Cassandra Lee\u2019s ability to understand her characters, as her performances in both K-On and Madoka Magica were outstanding, but I felt Taiga\u2019s depth was out of her range\u2026 And I never really liked Christine Marie Cabanos, although she was decent in Squidgirl. I wasn\u2019t initially expecting much, but this dub is literally perfect. And yes, I know what I\u2019m implying by putting the word literally before the word perfect\u2026 Believe me, I mean it that way. I can\u2019t imagine any cast coming together for Toradora better than this one did. All of those actors I\u2019d never heard of before\u2026 Like Erika Herlacher and Erik Kimerer\u2026 Are names I\u2019m going to be looking out for from now on. Cassandra Lee has only strengthened my confidence in her abilities, and as for Cabanos? I take back every negative thing I ever said about her. She is the star of this dub, and as such, I don\u2019t want to live in a world where her performance is anything other than star-making. Every inch of her becomes Minori Kushieda, from her sunny and boisterous exterior all the way down to her complex, insecure interior.  She\u2019s apparently found her niche in loud, energetic characters, so I hope she keeps getting roles like that one.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a handful of seasoned veterans among the cast, with Johnny Yong Bosch and Karen Strassman pulling off performances that are about what you\u2019d expect from them...  Which is a good thing, mind you.  And even though she\u2019s playing multiple second-string roles, like that weird parrot-thing, Wendee Lee hasn\u2019t sounded this good since Cowboy Bebop.\\n\\n\r\nSo, right from the first episode, or just from a simple explanation of the plot, most viewers will give this show a dismissive wave and say that it sounds too predictable.  \u201cOkay, so they\u2019re in love with each others\u2019 best friends, but they\u2019re going to wind up falling in love with each other, right?\u201d  I have literally sat and watched this with a first time viewer who said pretty much this, and then throw his hands up in defeat after about eight episodes of NOTHING going the way he predicted it would.  And that\u2019s part of the genius of this series.  The characters are familiar, the tropes are familiar, the setting is familiar, but none of it is ever played the way you\u2019d expect it to be played.  Take any problem that the romantic comedy/harem genre may have, and Toradora either avoids it completely or turns it upside down.\\n\\n\r\nFor example, there\u2019s the harem aspet.  It\u2019s a trend in way too many shows that nearly every female character in the cast will inexplicably fall head over heels in love with the male protagonist, ignoring all other options as not being main enough for them.  This is one of the biggest issues I had with Sword Art Online and Clannad, but it\u2019s not just a numbers issue...  In Tiger and Bunny, the main character had ONE girl fawning over him, and it was still bugged me by being completely unexplained.  In Toradora, yes, the three main girls have feelings for Ryuji, but there are a few things that set this series apart...  First off, it\u2019s only those three characters.  Second, all three of these love interests are explained in story, either explicitly or with subtlety, and they\u2019re all played out differently.  And finally, Ryuji\u2019s not the only eligible bachelor in the show...  His friend Yusaku gets just as much attention, and hell, the first character in the named cast to get a significant other is one of their classmates!\\n\\n\r\nAnother example is that in most harem shows, particularly the ones adapted from dating games (Which Toradora thankfully wasn\u2019t), the story seems disjointed, as each character gets their own arc while the main relationship just sits on the backburner until all the filler is done and the writers are damn well good and ready to just get to the point already.  But Toradora\u2019s story is, however, VERY tightly written.  There is not a single story arc in the single freaking series that doesn\u2019t somehow involve Taiga and Ryuji and their ever-developing dynamic, nor does the central plot ever get forgotten.  The other three mains may occasionally take a backseat, but they never disappear from a story completely.  \\n\\n\r\nHell, when you get down to it, all the little things that make up your typical romantic comedy are here...  But they\u2019re used in new, clever, often subversive ways that are never just there for the sake of being checked off of a tropes list.  Everything that you\u2019d expect to see in a show like this...  From bathing suit shopping to the obligatory beach episode...  Is executed in a way that\u2019s fresh, unique, and important to the story.  Hell, where most anime are happy to settle on a cafe or a haunted house for their culture fest episode, Toradora goes balls-out with a professional wrestling show, complete with faces, heels, an over-the-top script and choreographed in-ring action!  We never see any characters in the bath, because no matter what a lot of other shows may think, no on screen conversation ever NEEDS to take place in the bath.  There\u2019s a little bit of fanservice, but it\u2019s never gratuitous...  Except for a dream that one of the side characters has right before the Christmas arc, which was funny enough to be excusable...  And it\u2019s offset by a heaping helping of manservice, often willingly supplied by the unnervingly confident Yusaku, and even then, it\u2019s played entirely for laughs.  \\n\\n\r\nBut if I had to pick out one thing that makes this series stand out over the tops of all the other rom-coms out there, it would be exactly that...  Confidence.  Toradora is one hundred percent confident in the quality of the material it has to offer, and unlike a lot of other shows that value enthusiasm over ability, it\u2019s smart enough to know that it\u2019s confidence is well founded.  It never doubts itself, nor does it ever assume that YOU doubt it, and it never slows down or breaks it\u2019s outstanding pace to try and convince you otherwise.  It\u2019s this confidence that gives Toradora it\u2019s energy.  Well, that, and the amazing soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nToradora has an unwavering, dazzling energy just radiating from it at every moment of screen time.  That energy never goes away, even during the more tear-jerking scenes, because it never screws around...  Instead of pop culture references, Toradora casually rolls out references and metaphors related to it\u2019s own universe.  Where there are plenty of anime that fall into the trap of stopping their stories dead to show you backstory episodes you don\u2019t care about for characters who are just going to fade into the background afterwards...  His and Her Circumstances was particularly bad about this...  Toradora doesn\u2019t, because it knows that you\u2019ll care about the characters anyway.  It never does anything just because it feels like it should, nor does it ever show us anything just because we might want to see it.  The only time it really slows down is towards the end, and it only does it then because it has one hell of a perfect post-credits ending to close on.\\n\\n\r\nToradora was originally released on a pair of undubbed DVDs by Sentai Filmworks, and while those DVDs were just fine and dandy...  Once again, the sub is great all on it\u2019s own...  I would still highly recommend purchasing the DVD/Blu-Ray combo pack that was released last year by NIS America.  It\u2019s pricey, but it comes with a full color fan book and a generous helping of special features, including the cute and charming Hooray for Foodies mini-sodes.  It also comes with a short video of some of the impressions that Taiga made Ami do, and a dubbed OVA episode about the magic of making bento boxes, but I\u2019ll be honest, they were both kind of disappointing.  The OVA wasn\u2019t necessarily bad, but it would have dragged down the series if it had actually been included.  You can also stream the entire series, in either language, on Crunchyroll!\\n\\n\r\nToradora isn\u2019t just great, it\u2019s glowing.  With the exception of the animation, which is at the very least better than it has any right to be, there is nothing this series does wrong.  At twenty five episodes long, it\u2019s as fun to rewatch as any other show with half the episode count.  The high rewatch quality doesn\u2019t stop there, either, as the comedic and dramatic material are both so effective and so timeless that I still found myself constantly laughing and choking up after seven entire viewings.  It takes some of the worst things about the romantic comedy and harem genres and proves just how amazing those things can become with a little bit of effort, focus, and tender loving care.  I won\u2019t say whether or not the characters found that mysterious \u2018thing\u2019 they were looking for, but I found what I was looking for...  The best anime romantic comedy ever made.  I give Toradora a 10/10.",

            "content": "*massive spoilers*\r\nIf the anime had the pacing and interesting twists like in the first 4 eps that got me hooked to it, then I would have rated it a 9. However, the paced slowed down considerably, the filler eps did nothing for me and the ending was a little too\u2026.. much for me. I mean, yeah you two like each other and stuff, but deciding to get married without actually having experienced life as a couple? That\u2019s BEYOND dumb. Which is precisely why anime school children shouldn\u2019t be considered a benchmark for romantic relationships, and precisely why they *are* considered a benchmark.\r\nNeedless to say, Ididn\u2019t like the ending because it was farfetched, cheesy and melodramatic.\\n\r\nIf I had to only rate the 1st quarter, I\u2019d give this anime a 9.\\n\r\nFrom eps 5-16, I\u2019d give it a 6.\\n\r\nFrom eps 16-25, I\u2019d give it a 7\\n\\n\r\nOn the plus side, though, ep 16 was the most beautiful/outstanding ep for me from the entire series. It was beautifully written and steered clear of romantic cliches, which I\u2019m sure all fans enjoyed. \\n\r\nA lot of things didn\u2019t make sense to me, like:\\n\r\n# Why didn\u2019t Taiga confide in her best friend about her crush?\\n\r\n# Why didn\u2019t Taiga speak highly of Ryu in front of her so that she could see him in a better light? That\u2019s literally the first thing to do when your buddy likes another buddy of yours\\n\r\n# Why is she more comfortable sharing her emotional issues with Ryu (except the daddy problem) than her bestie who she\u2019s known for years?\\n\r\n# Why is Ryu so worked up when he sees Taiga upset on the stage during the paegent, but is totally chill when his best bud has a meltdown and colours his hair? He didn\u2019t even *bother* getting to know what happened. If he wanted to give his bestie \u201cspace\u201d then shouldn\u2019t the same thing have applied to Taiga?\\n\r\n# Why does Ryu put up with Taiga\u2019s constant physical and verbal abuse? Verbal I get; they need to make us laugh. But the constant and unnecessary physical abuse? Really? He obviously doesn\u2019t like it and has said it out loud but why does he do nothing to stop it?\\n\r\n# Why is Taiga such a bully? I mean you can have a cold and \u201cruthless\u201d demeanour without having to be such a bully to Ryu. The way she treats him is unacceptable, especially how she just demands things from him \u2013 like cooking her food or sewing her clothes. \\n\r\n# Why does the bestie ask Taiga to be friends when she confesses her love to him? Either say yes, or say no. What\u2019s this \u201cfriends\u201d business which isn\u2019t even explored (it\u2019s completely ignored) in the series? \\n\r\n# Since Ryu and his bestie both know Taiga likes him, why doesn\u2019t Ryu just sit down and talk out his feelings with him? What\u2019s the point of having Taiga hold on to something she doesn\u2019t know the answer to?\\n\r\n# Ryu\u2019s assumed to be a delinquent and he wants people to see him for who he really is. But this angle is explored only in the first 3-4 eps. For the rest of the series (barring 4-5 dialogues), this aspect is completely forgotten. Same with his habit of twisting his hair.\\n\r\n# I get that the mother is a ditz, but how the fuk are the grandparents okay with their teen grandson wanting to marry? HOW? \\n\r\n# Taiga\u2019s \u201creason\u201d for leaving was fuking stupid. It wasn\u2019t even a reason. Which still doesn\u2019t explain why she didn\u2019t show poor Ryuji the courtesy of a) telling him she\u2019s leaving b) explain *why* she\u2019s leaving c) do whatever improvement she wanted on herself by being by *Ryuji\u2019s* side. Dumb girl.\\n\\n\r\nThere were other things that bothered me too, but then this review would be way too long. If anybody has any response to what I\u2019ve posted above, please do drop by my profile. \\n\\n\r\nPS. I liked how it avoided many romantic cliches, which is why it annoyed me that the two MCs ended up together. Really? REALLY?",

            "content": "This is just too cute.\r\nOh just thinking about this series makes me want to get in a relationship and do some lovey dovey stuff. DAMN THE REALISTIC WORLD. \r\n-Insert forever alone meme-\r\nGood high school romantic comedies can be a lot of fun to watch. The bad ones, on the other hand, have the tendency to annoy viewers with tired clich\u00e9s and are often neither romantic nor funny. Without a doubt, the anime title Toradora! falls into the first category. It not only contains some touching romance and hilarious comedy, but is also beautifully animated and cleverly scripted, making it a highly energetic and entertaining series.\\n\\n\r\nTakasu Ryuuji dislikes the way his eyes look: menacing and rebellious. It is the first day of his second year in high school, and he is trying to change his appearance to match his kind personality. At school, Ryuuji bumps into a short girl who is known for bringing trouble, Aisaka Taiga. After a long turn of events, Taiga reveals that she likes Kitamura Yuusaku, one of Ryuuji\u2019s few friends and Ryuuji then reciprocates by revealing to her that he likes Taiga\u2019s friend, Kushieda Minori. They decide to make a pact in which Taiga will help Ryuuji confess to Minori if he becomes her \u201cdog\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs on the whole are simple but attractive, and each each character's animation helps to communicate his or her personality: Ryuuji's slumped posture, Minori's exuberance, and Ami's haughty cool can be read equally well from their body language as from their dialogue. Far and away, the most visual sugar gets sprinkled on Aisaka Taiga; whether she be sleeping, toweling her hair, or using a doughnut as a halo, she looks fantastic.\\n\\n\r\nSound-wise, you have catchy opening and ending themes set alongside beautifully animated sequences. It's all a beautiful riot of colors and is extremely well-timed. The BGM is alright in my opinion; there's a few memorable pieces such several piano themes and guitar pieces that really compliment a few of scenes. They bring out the emotions of the characters and really strike the feeling home. Otherwise, the music didn't catch my attention too much. The voice acting is extremely well done, delivering the dialogues with all the right emotions.\\n\\n\r\nI could go on and on about the characters but I'll try to keep it brief. The personalities and interactions of the characters really brings this entire show above the normal threshold for such a genre. Though they seem cookie-cutter in the beginning, it quickly changes as the story continues and they gain a level of depth and believability. You become so invested in their endeavors and become invested in their goals, especially in Ry\u016bji and Taiga. The side characters are a little more predictable, but they each have their levels of depth that make the show enjoyable to watch\\n\\n\r\nTo put it simply, Toradora is a good anime. There's a great mix between comedy and romance, although sometimes the melodrama could be over the top if you're not used to it. The pacing of the story is done well and the cast of characters are charming and entertaining to watch. One gripe would probably be that the ending left a little more to be desired. It was a little out of the blue and for a second I was worried that the characters would make all the wrong choices but they pulled through in the end!\\n\\n\r\nThe people I've seen talk about Toradora! tend to get fixated on either half of the show, which is a horrible mistake. Taken as a whole, this work's honesty and humor paints a picture of high school romance and heartbreak that rings true. The loving, detailed visuals, laid back atmosphere and modest scope make the series a perfect introduction to the romance genre and a standout anime in its own right. No matter how angry it makes me at one moment, the next scene or episode has me singing its praises. In short, Toradora! is a lot like it's subject matter: In turns hilarious, rambling, confused, charming, and foolish, but ultimately a worthwhile and heartwarming experience. \\n\\n\r\nWell, I'd better get back to my seat. The unmarried woman with her unmarried face is about to come to start the unmarried homeroom.",

            "content": "Looking to expand my occasionally action or intellectually centered anime tastes, I perused the top rated anime list in the hopes of sparking interest for something a little different. Toradora has been recommended to me a number of times over the years, but I've always been hesitant or too busy to give it a try. Perhaps it's the inconsistencies I have with the romantic comedies genre. Shows like Nodame Cantabile have left significant impressions on me, while others have been mediocre or laughable at best. Believable love stories can be difficult to convey as a narrative, especially when you start to add petty high schooldrama and love triangles into the mix. Finish everything off with an emotional punching bag mc and exasperating tsundere and you've got the potential for failure. It took me over two months to finish Toradora for good reason. I took small breaks from it, tried to put it on hold and even considered dropping it entirely, but through sheer willpower I have reached its conclusion and wish to share why Toradora just doesn't work as a romantic anime.\\n\\n\r\nI'll cut right to the chase. From its opening scene, you can tell Toradora is not trying to be your stereotypical slice of life anime. The dialogue is witty and the comedy is crass and rapidfire. Ryuji initially seemed like a refreshing protagonist in both appearance and attitude. Given his parental background, his desire to be self-sufficient is understandable. This perception quickly deteriorates as more of the characters and setting are introduced, and the infamous tsundere, Aisaka or \"Taiga\" steals the show. Now if there's one thing I've learned, it's that girls and guys have a limited number of situations in which it's believable for them to be friends. Maybe they were in diapers together or what have you but most of the time it doesn't work out without someone getting hurt or having feelings for each other. Knowing this fact you can pretty much sum up the entire plot of Toradora within the first two episodes. They're eventually going to end up together. Ryuchi and Taiga are both in love with each other's best friends, so naturally they miserably attempt to help each other pursue the affections of the other party. Every attempt to get the prospective couples alone goes awry, a great bit of foreshadowing on the writer's behalf. It sounds like a simple love story, and it really should've been. Except the countless awkward conversations and feeble advances our main characters had with their respective love interests help to cement the fact they don't deserve to be in love at their age. The ensuing 25 episodes consist of these awkward exchanges and the melodrama is so thick you could cut it with a knife. Most every interaction is misunderstood or blown out of proportion, and literally everything becomes an emotional crisis with these characters. All the while Ryuji is incessantly berated with physical and emotional abuse from Taiga. But it's OK, that just means she loves him... or something like that.\\n\\n\r\nForgive my philosophical ramblings, but I've learned through the years and relationships I've had that you can't choose who you want to fall in love with. Love just happens. It can be crude and fickle, but at the end of the day it can give you a feeling unlike anything you've felt before. This is why I don't question the validity of odd couple romances (Ore Monogatari/Nodame Cantabile etc.) throughout entertainment. Sometimes characters are polar opposites in personality and looks but something subconscious draws them together. This is what Toradora tries to accomplish. However, a relationship constructed in this manner must be done with finesse, while not being overshadowed by such melodrama as this series has. Similarly growing up in a house without a father as I have, the furthest idea from my mind would be to take care of someone with so much baggage. Taiga takes advantage of the doormat Ryuji is and carries herself in the most bombastic way possible. Ryuji is most certainly a glutton for punishment. Even if I would've enjoyed the romance elements I don't know if I could've stomached the abortion of an ending Toradora had. Many anime fail at getting love right, and this series ends up no different. All it takes is for someone to have an overly emo moment and the entire conclusion gets blown to smithereens. As the final credits were about to roll, the same tsundere stigma that was starting to fade away was slammed back into my face, taking a big shit on my hopes and expectations for the show. Those who have seen the series know exactly what I'm talking about, One of the worst endings I have seen in quite some time, a romance cop out.\\n\\n\r\nToradora's writing was frustratingly inconsistent. Character's dialogue and emotions would swap from operatic to deeply intellectual within seconds, leaving me dumbfounded as a viewer. All five main characters put on some sort of a fa\u00e7ade with their personality, driving the story into many arguments and miscommunications. That was an aspect that I enjoyed to some extent, as I believe most everyone acts a little differently in groups of people than in a one on one interaction. The pacing is well constructed, and the series ends up being split into three major parts. The first half of the series is used mostly to set up the relationships for the five characters, but unfortunately ended up being quite boring as a result. Around episode 14 things really begin to pick up, with conflicts coming to a head as the main characters start running out of time to profess their love appropriately. Everything is assimilated effectively but falls flat due to a train wreck ending. I feel like most people who consider the ending good are only fooling themselves with false reassurance for investing so much time in the series only to be greatly disappointed. I understand that I'm probably not the target audience for this anime, but just because you're portraying a high school romantic comedy doesn't mean you have to sensationalize each line of dialogue or character's emotions. We all went to high school, but I never felt like everyone was that annoying... at least not all the time.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough there were numerous moments of immaturity, Toradora created a setting that made me quite reminiscent of my time in high school. Embarking on school trips, creating chances to talk to that one girl you liked since grade school, or waiting for that same opportunity during a school dance or function. Although I'm frustrated by it now, hindsight is 20/20 and I could probably imagine myself being slightly timid or awkward when it came to confession time... perhaps just not on the same level as the writer portrayed here. I also love the scene with Ryuji and Minori when they were at Ami's beachhouse at night. The way they were talking about love without coming out and blatantly saying the word kind of made me laugh, and help me put back into perspective what I was watching, and how young the characters really were.\\n\\n\r\nI found it irritating when the writers tried to pass off Ryuji's slanted eyes as the reason everyone thought he was rough around the edges. I know I've judged books by their covers before, but this one is just silly... not to mention the fact that most, if not all of these characters are Asian, which kind of throws that reasoning out the window. As I said before, I related to Ryuji based on personal experiences, and I was initially hoping he'd be a character I could identify with. His germaphobic nature and desire to be the patriarchal figure in his household was right on point, but I didn't buy into his relationship with Taiga one bit. The tsundere trope has always felt unnecessary to me. Even yanderes like Senjougahara from the Monogatari series has some believability, because I've encountered some crazy chicks in my lifetime... And sometimes it makes them even hotter. But it just isn't working in Taiga's case. I can give positive remarks to the amount of depth she had as a character though... and the relationship with her parents was certainly believable. I guess you never realize how pampered some kids can be until they start trying to live on their own (Taiga=primordial millennial). I just don't understand everyone's general praise for Taiga as a character, he'll she's not even the most enjoyable character from the series, let alone all of anime.\\n\\n\r\nMinori actually had some depth as a character. She put on such a ditzy and carefree attitude, but in all actuality she was just as perceptive as anyone else in the series, especially when it came to Ryuji. It was refreshing to see a character playing an \"out of reach\" love interest that was everything but one-dimensional. That scene when she approached Ryuji while he was in the bear suit was kind of heartbreaking. By that point you knew the feelings she had for him were mutual, and how covered up she got them to be for Taiga's sake. Kitamura is a turd. High school taught me how vain and superficial girls can be, and if I learned anything from that, it's that no girls are attracted to the guy with glasses. Not to mention he was a complete dweeb, with spastic mannerisms that often made no sense and a complete lack of composure when he finds out his crush doesn't like him. Grow up dude, you're barely old enough to drive! It's like he almost went completely nihilistic after he bleached his hair. I kind of kept wondering how Ryuji even became friends with him, they're really nothing alike. Ami is the only character in Toradora that I actually liked to be honest. It seems that her history and modeling has actually injected a sense of maturity into her mind that the other characters just don't have. While the rest of the cast is laden with melodrama, Ami seems to come out of left field with a comment I'd expect to see in real life. Although I don't understand what she saw in Ryuji, I would've preferred if they would've ended up together vice the way that it turned out. I can only imagine how she struggled to take her friends seriously.\\n\\n\r\nThe music in Toradora is so-so. It didn't necessarily add or subtract much from the series... But there wasn't much variety in the use of background music. I really enjoyed the first OP and ED, but the 2nd OP really didn't flow well with the rest of the show for me... And those lyrics are ghastly. I will give props to the voice acting in Toradora, as most all of the characters were played fantastically and were very distinguishable. Most notably was Rie Kugimiya as Taiga. Her voice absolutely nailed Taiga's seething personality and tsunderisms to a tee. Yui Horie also dos a fine job as the spacey Minori. The art and animation is okay, considering the anime came out over 7 years ago I'd say it aged quite well.  As I mentioned above I was pleased by the stark differences between the five main characters, in character models especially. Some older anime have trouble differentiating the characters due to lackluster illustrators, but Toradora does not fall into that trap.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I was quite disappointed with this series. It just didn't capture the natural, unadulterated love that so many romance stories have. It even got boring with its unneeded drama and emotion-stricken scenes, leaving me to take the characters less seriously. People say that Toradora is the pinnacle of the romantic comedy genre, and if that's the case I may not be returning to it for quite some time.  I can't say I enjoyed it all that much. I'd recommend Toradora to fans of romance anime since that's the target audience, or someone who enjoys the tsundere trope... it just wasn't necessarily for me.

            "content": "[Spoilers Mates] I have had my Toradora box set sitting on my shelf since 2012 or 13. I've had the VN for the PSP sitting around for years too, I have no idea why it took me so long to watch and finish this amazing show but god damn was it worth it.\r\nNow with the story let me start off by saying I was really impressed with the pacing, romance and drama in the story. I mean, it  was unfortunately too predictable for me however that did not stop it from being great. I liked that no matter what episode I was watching therewas always a sense of joy and a little bit of wonder. I'd always be thinking to myself \"Hmm, I wonder what antics Ryuji and Taiga are going to try to get closer to the ones they allegedly love.\" Now, there were numerous moments that I was disappointed about. From the first or second episode when Taiga confesses and gets friend-zoned by Yuusaku it's a dead give away from her speech about Ryuji that she may have already fallen for him. I was disappointed about that because I felt that it was too early for that to be established. Additional moments that  made it predictable and a bit less enjoyable or less suspenseful for me was that after Ryuji's mother calls Taiga family, and lastly, more importantly is how they both go so far to support each others unrequited love.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on from the story the artwork and most character designs are pretty good, especially for it's time. I think the only character's whose character designs I didn't care for was Ryuji. I'm not going to complain to much though because his character was supposed to be the delinquent type and the eyes, giving him such evil looking eyes and messy-ish hair work in that sense. Soundtrack... meh, only one good song that stood out for me and that was the track played when something sad or emotional was occurring. I'm a sucker for piano songs.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters were pretty amazing for the most part! I liked the relationships between the main and supporting characters, I felt like no characters were wasted. Even the background characters like Ryuji's friends. It was like every character had a purpose in the show and that's something I always like to see. Characters being put to good use even if they are people you don't really care about.\\n\\n\r\nToradora! was totally an enjoyable experience for me in some sense. I would recommend it to those who are more or less new to romance series. This is because as I mentioned earlier, it's really predictable and that easy predictability can really take away the enjoyment of the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I have to give Toradora! 8/10 because while the story wasn't it's strong point the bond between the characters is something that makes it greater!\\n",

            "content": "Just from reading the synopsis and glancing over a few of the scores this anime received, I decided not to watch to it. One day I was in the mood for a romance and decided to check out Toradora! again, this time reading through several of the reviews. And, in all honesty, if I hadn't, I probably would have dropped the anime after the first few episodes. Yet, the promises that it would get a lot better by around episode six kept me watching. That, plus the fact that so many of the reviewers like it so much. It was also said to be similarto Lovely Complex, which it wasn't. At all. \\n\\n\r\nStory/Characters; \\n\\n\r\nIt goes like this: Meet cute, crazy stuff, they work together and develop a sort of abusive friendship, then a lot, lot, lot of crazy stuff happens, not just with the two main characters, but also with the majority of the supporting characters. This anime makes sure to focus on everyone in the anime -- and nobody in class 2-C seems to have a boring life. \\n\\n\r\nA lot of people seemed to rate this anime lower than they would have liked to due to predictability. If that is something that turns you off, then in my opinion, you should totally watch this anime. It was one of the least predictable animes I have ever watched. Sure, you think you know what is going to happen (and what obviously is supposed to happen) at the start, but then everything goes haywire and you are left with several different options. And all of them have a very, very likely chance of being correct. Until the very end, each option is given enough supporting evidence to be proven a valid guess. I promise you, it is very unlikely that you will know what will happen next in this story. If anything, you will be dying to know or pissed off because all of your assumptions were incorrect. \\n\\n\r\nNow, I didn't like the story of this anime so much. Although it seemed obvious that they will be happiest together, I feel like Taiga and Ryuuji are an odd couple. Taiga is pretty abusive towards Ryuuji throughout the show, and a lot of the time I felt like he deserved better. They are both pretty selfish characters in their own way, as well. I never felt like they really belonged together. They seemed to be perfect best friends for each other, but no more than that. While watching the show, I really did get the sense of a father/daughter relationship between them, instead of two classmates and peers. That didn't really appeal to me.\\n\\n\r\nMost romantic animes really let you see inside the characters' heads and into their hearts. This show doesn't do that. At the end, you will find that there is a lot that you didn't know about the characters -- things that could have completely changed your feelings about the show had they been introduced earlier. Instead of feeling like someone watching the lives of these characters play out before you, you almost just feel like an invisible person sitting in their classrooms and sometimes following the characters around. Like a stalker. Not a fan of the show, but a stalker. Although that does sound very nice, it does help you feel like you are a part of the characters' lives. You learn things just as slowly as any involved fellow classmate would. \\n\\n\r\nNow for a hardcore romance fan like myself, this story like may seem very tedious and hard to get through, for the romantic progression is very slow. It's there, but it is dragging along to the point where you may feel like skipping a few episodes in order to find out if the pace will ever speed up. I am here to tell you that it does. For about the last five or six episodes, it does. And what you get in those last episodes isn't really enough to endure for. For those who love humor, I didn't really feel like this show was great for that either. I didn't really find myself laughing a lot. Then again, that may just be because everything else is so consuming that I didn't really pay attention to any possible humor. \\n\\n\r\nNow, the characters in this show are pretty...amazing, to say the least. They all of have depth and each one could easily have at least a mediocre level anime set around them. Each character is very important to the show, as you will see if you watch it. They take up some screen time, but because of the time and effort put into their character development, that screen time is very enjoyable to watch. I was never frustrated when episodes focused on another character more often than Taiga and Ryuuji. Each character also has a nice air of mystery around them, which I feel added to the show's overall enjoyability.\\n\\n\r\nWhile many people say that this is one of the best animes that they have ever watched, I disagree. Surely it is memorable because of how original it is and because of the ending, but not because I was blown away by it. The ending wasn't enough to make up for the other 20 or so episodes. \\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound; \\n\\n\r\nThe art in Toradora! was pretty unique. It's memorable for being different, just like the rest of the show. The coloring is pretty arrogant, but very eye-catching. The action scenes are drawn very well, though. They were very good about keeping proportions throughout the show. Now, while things were accurate, all of the detail seemed to be focused on the eyes of the characters -- which were some of the best I have ever seen. Although at times the eyes just seemed to take over their entire face, I didn't find it to be too distracting. The facial expressions were amazing as well. You could really feel what the character's felt just by looking at their intense and masterfully drawn expressions. \\n\\n\r\nI did love the music for the anime, though. Both the EDs and the OPs were very nice. I believe that I will be listening to them for quite some time. I also really liked the fact that the voice actors sang the songs. It helped me really connect to the show. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion;\\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't recommend this to a friend, but I wouldn't tell them it would be a waste of their time to watch it if they felt like it. I don't feel like this anime held up to all the astounding reviews it had, but it also didn't hold up for all the weak points other reviewers suggested, in my mind. It is a very memorable show, but only because it is different and what you think will happen doesn't really happens -- this show really manages to shock you very frequently. This show is a lot more about friendship than it is about romance, in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nShould I watch it?;\\n\\n\r\nIf you are in the mood for a dramatic romance, or a hysterical romantic comedy, that has a predictable plot line and focuses on the ups and downs of one relationship and lets you see into the hearts of the characters -- a show that talks about how high school life fits into a romance, one that has a nice shoujo art style and really helps you feel for the characters, I suggest you find something else. On the other hand, if you want to watch a nice coming-of-age story, one that deals with friendship a lot more than it does romance, one that focuses on the difficulties of finding and accepting yourself while still pleasing others, and is about finding those that mean a lot to you and filling a void in your life -- one that has a not-so-normal couple and a lot of love possibilities (and a lot of possibility in general), one that gives each character a lot of depth, mystery, and some adequate screen time, and one that makes you feel like a part of the story and is a pretty memorable tale, then this is for you.",

            "content": "As we dash forward to chase our ideals, we may eventually realize that what we were chasing was beside us this whole time.\r\nThat is the basic premise that Toradora builds its story upon. Although Toradora is a rom com, the story line is not your typical rom com plot line. Our two main characters, Ryuji and Taiga, help each other get matched up with the other's friend. Furthermore, Taiga, for some reason, does not know how to take care of herself so it's up to Ryuji to make sure Taiga eats well and lives like a human. Obviously, it's inevitable that they will grow closertogether. I enjoyed the fact that we don't have the main characters \"coincidentally\" encounter each other and develop feelings for one other that way. Instead, Toradora makes it so that we always see our couple together, scheming how they should get the guy/girl of their dreams.  \\n\r\nAs you begin watching the show, you may realize that it's mainly funny moments with Taiga and Ryuji and that the romance is meh. But as you move into the second half of Toradora, the comedic elements begin to take second wheel and the romantic elements take center stage. I assure that it's a great feels trip. If you haven't been rooting for a character at this point, the story will convince you to root for someone. I definitely would say that the second half of Toradora is the best part of the entire anime and what makes it endearing for so long.\\n\\n\r\nIn Toradora, we have Ryuji as the male lead who is often mistaken to be a goon but in fact, deep down, he is a very caring guy (who is also a clean freak). Taiga is our main female lead. Aptly nicknamed \"Palmtop Tiger,\" she is someone who is not afraid to let her fists do the talking. For our \"secondary\" characters, we have Minori (Ryuji's crush), Kitamura (Taiga's crush), and Ami, a model who is an acquaintance of Kitamura. Although I label these three as \"secondary\" characters, they get ample screen time and a lot of development. This is another aspect that Toradora does well. The writers did not abandon them. Rather, Minori, Kitamura, and Ami are essential characters to the story but they don't take away our desire to see the developing chemistry between Taiga and Ryuji.\\n\r\nThe only troubling aspect of Toradora is that at times, I found myself extremely frustrated because the characters can't either express themselves or seem oblivious to the feelings of others. Indeed, these are things that happen in real relationships, which makes Toradora very relatable, but since the anime is a rom com, this element doesn't mesh well with the genre.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was fairly good. There were a few emotional scenes where the music helped bring out my emotions but other than that, the background music was alright. However, it was not intrusive in any way and was well-composed for the situation. The voice actors brought out the unique characteristics of each character and did a wonderful job. \\n\r\nI didn't quite like the opening and ending themes to Toradora. Although the beat of the first opening is pretty cool, I found the opening did not match the atmosphere of Toradora. \\n\\n\r\nThe artwork was good. There were some scenes where the colours were very rich and captured the mood really well. In general, Toradora leans on a vibrant colour palette. I felt that the character designs were a little simple. For example, Ami isn't drawn like a model as she should be so without telling you she's a model, you will think of her as just another student.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough I don't think Toradora lived up to its hype, I enjoyed the anime. Since Taiga is the Queen of Tsunderes, you should have Toradora on your anime list (otherwise, she may come at night and hit you with her wooden katana). Even if you aren't a big Tsundere fan but still enjoy rom coms, you  should have Toradora on your list because it is a very memorable anime. \\n\\n\r\nI definitely would tell you to check out Toradora! Let me know what you liked or disliked about this anime. Was it over-hyped? Was the ending spot on? I would love to hear from you!",

            "content": "Toradora is one of the first animes that left me questioning whether I enjoyed the ride or not... In my opinion, I feel like the progression of the story and the way the characters are conflict in so many ways.\r\nStarting in order of importance:\r\nStory - It was very spot-on and unique. A story about a boy meeting a girl for the purpose of giving each other relationship advice is not the conventional anime. It does not go direct with the romance. Rather, it takes its time to establish the characters and their relations amongst each other. The pacing of the story was also great, eachepisode you learn something new. However, the reason I gave it an 8 was the ending. One thing I REALLY hate about this anime is how whenever a character talks to the main character of how they truly feel, the main character ends up not listening and the whole conversation just drops like a rock. This recurrent element made it difficult for me to get to know the characters. They, most of the time, introduce their problems and almost never finish off with how it ties to the story, The ending was \\n\\n\r\n(SPOILER ALERT) \\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nalso super rushed and it felt as if all their efforts from the very beginning had gone to waste. The ending was a big middle finger to all of the other characters within the last few episodes. They get cast out and the unfinished links with the main character remain unlinked.\\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - The characters are very realistic. Every character puts on a mask in their own way. There is a large barrier between how the characters act and how they truly feel. \\n\r\nOne big complaint I have, however, is that each character is frustrating to the plot in its own way. There are random potential scenes that could lead to something moving the plot, but in the end you learn almost nothing of the characters from that scene. The only time we get to truly know the characters is AFTER you go through all the frustration of the progression of the story.\\n\\n\r\nArt - The art makes this anime. Each character is distinct in their own way and the colors they use is awesome.\\n\\n\r\nSound - It moves with the story well, especially the opening. Very beautiful and well-timed.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - The comedic scenes were really enjoyable and some really dramatic scenes hit me hard. Although this anime failed to meet a resolution, it does make unforgettable climaxes that occur amongst each character. In short, when shit gets down, it GETS DOWN. \\n\\n\r\nTOO LONG DIDN'T READ?:\\n\\n\r\nStory is realistic and complex. However, when you think something important to the story is going to happen, it won't happen. Each character is lovable and different in their own way. Art and Sound is beautiful. Very enjoyable, you will get hooked. When shit gets down, IT GETS DOWN.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Story: Not much to say for a storyline in Toradora, it seems pretty much to be a series of conflicts, one following the other. However, I'm not saying that the conflicts aren't interesting, but for people who like one strong storyline, this series is not for you.\r\nArt: One of the strong points of Toradora. The artwork I must say, sorry IamJoe, is \"fabulous\" ^^. The artwork is fluid and clean. The pictures have strong colors that catch the eye, and keep your attention. Shading, light, etc, are all well composed throughout the anime. Each scene, disregarding events, are highly detailed, and only compliments and enhcancesthe anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The music in the OP and ED, though not my style, succeed in conveying the events in the anime, which is actually quite rare in anime. In addition to actually matching the story, the music is catchy. I often find myself in school or at home bored, and before realizing it, I am singing &quot;Banira, salturade, banira.&quot; Quite embarrassing when everybody in class turns around and stares at me. &lt;&lt;\\n\r\nBut yeah, good music.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Another strong point in Toradora, the characters all have strong personalities, and are generably likable. The characters go through life changing events that do change them forever, giving the anime a sense of realism. The characters all have unique designs that support their personalities, and make the series that much better.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Toradora is mostly enjoyable. Now, notice I say &quot;mostly&quot;. There are a considerable number of dull points that made me want to stop watching the series, for me, mostly in the beginning. However, if you give the anime a chance, after a few episodes, the anime will grow on you, and you will come to like it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Good",

            "content": "[Adapted From Original Blog Post]\r\nI'm sure you've heard this expression before: \"don't judge a book by its cover\" It's a very simple phrase, the meaning being that you can't judge something by what it appears to be, and it's a phrase that you hear repeated, over and over again, no matter where you go in your life. However, despite this, I think you'd be surprised by just how often we judge things superficially, whether it be anime, movies, situations, and most of all: people, way, way, too often. I bring up this for two reasons. This relates to the review because when you first seeToradora and read the description of the show, it's all too easy to completely dismiss, because on the outside, Toradora looks like every other boring slice-of-life/school romance anime that has ever been created, with a bland protagonist, nerdy best friend, and tsundere love interest all wrapped in a high-school setting that has at this point past the point of \"done to death\" and reached the point of \"this is really getting old, please stop\". But while on the outside Toradora may look incredibly bland and passionless, the product of the dangling flesh off of the actually interesting-looking shows of the season, included only to fill the space, it's actually possibly one of the most competent anime I've ever seen at exactly what it does and accomplishes by the end of its run. The second reason is while Toradora is undoubtedly a story about a misunderstood teenager named Ryuugi and a fierce girl named Aisaka Taiga discovering for themselves exactly what this thing called love actually is, it is also, somewhat, about \"judging a book by its cover\". About the dangers of stereotyping the people around you. About those personas we put on during our every day lives, when we're with acquaintances, friends, or even family. About those hidden emotions and desires that we never tell the world or can't admit to ourselves, that will eventually, inevitably, make themselves visible for all to see. And why that's okay.\\n\\n\r\n     Hello people of \"The Wired\", my name is Quan, I hope you've had a great day thus far, and welcome, one and all, to anime review 15#. Today we take a look at the heavily acclaimed slice-of-life-romance anime: Toradora(exclamation mark technically, but seriously, that will just mess me up so screw it), and maybe along the way, find out for sure who \"best girl\" really is. Now then, let's begin.\\n\\n\r\nToradora was brought to us by the animation studio J.C Staff, a studio that I\"m quite fond of, even if few seem to share my view point. They've brought us nice little shows over the years, all three seasons of Shakugan no Shana, Selector Infected WIXOSS, Ano Natsu de Matteru, A Certain Scientific Railgun and its sequel A Certain Scientific Railgun S. If you were to put me on the spot, I'd perhaps say that Toradora remains their strongest work(though arguably WIXOSS and Railgun S are better), which sort of shows that they typically don't produce particularly exceptional anime much of the time. That's why it's surprising, I guess, to see an anime like Toradora come from them.\\n\\n\r\n      The director was Tatsuyuki Nagai, who you may recognize, and for good reason, since he is a quite exceptional director. He's brought us works such as Anohana: The Flower We Saw That Day, Ano Natsu de Matteru and A Certain Scientific Railgun, which sort of makes it odd that he directed something as mature as this anime. It was written by Mari Okada of WIXOSS, Anohana, Nagi no Asukara and Gosick fame, and the series aired between October 2, 2008 and March 26, 2009. Into the plot. \\n\\n\r\nRyuuji Takasu is ready for the best year of high-school he has ever had. Till this point, he had been shunned by classmates for his fierce looks and eyes that seem to glare at whoever he looks at, so he has had trouble making friends and convincing the teachers he doesn't want to beat them up. However, this year, not only is he in the same class as his best friend: Yuusaku Kitamura, but also the girl he has had an borderline-obsessive crush on for the last few years on: the optimistic and cheerful Minori Kushieda, but since Ryuuji has absolutely no intentions of confessing his feelings, well ever, he is content to watch on without doing anything. The second thing to happen on his first day of school is that he meets Aisaka Taiga(and by meets I mean she punches him in the jaw and walks off). Taiga has earned the nickname \"Palm-Top Tiger\" throughout the school, because while she is so short that it's easy to mistake her for a small child, she has a violent and aggressive personality and will take absolutely nothing from anybody.\\n\\n\r\nAfter this meeting, it would seem like the two would like nothing more to do with each-other, however, various circumstances draw the two together again, as Ryuuji accidentally discovers Taiga's love letter to Kitamura. After calming her down enough so she won't impale him with her sword, Ryuuji strikes a deal with Taiga: he'll help her confess to Kitamura properly, as long as Taiga helps him get closer to her best friend: Minori Kushieda. I'm sure you can see where this is going. So, as the two agree to help each-other with their own romantic endeavors, they not only begin to discover the true nature of their respective crushes, but also each-other, as Taigi learns that Ryuuji is not in fact a no-good delinquent as much as actually a really nice guy, and Ryuuji learns that there is far more to the Palm-Top Tiger, his group of friends, and the very nature of love, than he could possibly imagined. This sets the stage for one of the, in my opinion, absolute best slice-of-life/romance/drama anime of the last decade, that along the way turns from exactly what you expect to something you never saw coming, and by the end, has more profound things to say about love, relationships and people than any romance Hollywood or other mediums have produced for the last few years. An anime not without flaws, but deserves all the praise I'm about to give it.\\n\\n\r\nThe first thing you need to admit about the nature of Toradora is that it is built primarily on a foundation of cliches and archetypes. This is not an original plot, many have done this story before and many more will do so in the future, and, at least at first, all the characters are cliches you've seen a million time before. Ryuuji is \"the nice guy\", Taigi is such a tsundere that she has pretty much become a poster-child for the archetype in the last few years(along such \"deres\" as Asuka from Evangelion, Senjougahara Hitagi from Bakemonogatari and Shana from Shakugan no Shana), and all the other characters fit into archetypes such as: \"the guy with glasses\", \"the ball-of-energy\", and \"the manipulative bitch\". Locations are pretty typical as well, because when it isn't school it just has to be a festival, or a beach, or pick whatever cliche you want out of a hat. However, what you really need to give Toradora credit for is how it handles these familiarities of the genre, instead of letting everything play out in a typical way, it actually takes these archetypes and crafts and develops them, investigating the ever-changing character dynamics and relationships and uses them to hammer home its thematic point, which is not easy to do no matter what genre you are talking about: to deliver a firm message without sacrificing characters or exposition to make sure you get your point across.\\n\\n\r\nIt just takes a little while to get there is all. You will undoubtedly watch the first half of Toradora with a judging look on your face, because it's really nothing that special. Sure, a few moments split up the mediocrity in that time frame, but the first half of Toradora is hardly anything you've never seen before in a million other slice-of-lives. It's not bad by any means, after all, the show has a good sense for comedy and cuteness(particularly in Taiga's case), and the characters are enduring if one-dimensional, but no doubt you might be wondering what all the fuss is about for these span of episodes. It wasn't till much later on, at the end of the school festival arc that I was really sold on the show, and that's a whole 13 episodes in... which you know, is more than half the show, so that's a huge problem really. What I want you to take out of this section however, is not to let your expectations drop this show in the first half, because that will ultimately let down the experience of the whole show. Instead, appreciate a little the build-up and moving character pieces in this first half, because undoubtedly, this first half is a very well orchestrated, very meticulous set-up of the story contextual and thematically. How about I put it like this? If you took the first half of the show and cut it entirely, the show would fall apart at the seems, because what the first half is most definitely not is filler, and for that, I'm grateful. And hey, it's still not terrible, so if you like these kind of shows you should be more than entertained for this first half.\\n\\n\r\n     But yes, I've built it up enough, so I'll admit it: the second half is where the anime really comes alive for me. Suddenly it isn't watching stereotypes amble through a non-existent plot, it's watching characters grow and change as their emotions and desires push forward the plot to an inevitable and emotional conclusion, making the last 5 or so episodes of show tense and satisfying as all these relationships that the anime had built up in that first half play out and collide, and it's satisfying as hell. That's one thing I really give Toradora credit for: it has an ending, and not just an ending, but a perfectly concise and complete ending, that leaves no room for a satisfying sequel or anything like that, and that's something I think is a little under-appreciated: an ending. Mostly how these slice-of-life play out is that they end inconclusively; relationships still developing so they never actually go anywhere, and plot-lines unfinished because there wasn't enough source material or whatever. This completeness is what puts Toradora above other anime of the genre, it just doesn't hint at relationships between characters and leave the two in a sort of \"shipping limbo\", it fully explores each and every one, giving each plot-line a conclusion, as well as each character. And after 25 episodes of watching these characters, you are completely and totally satisfied with what you have seen, and me personally, didn't want to see anymore. That's rare, especially for an anime, where you are lucky if your favorite show even gets a third season after leaving the story at a crappy cliffhanger(yes, I'm looking at you Spice and Wolf(and yes, I'm still bitter)). Some may not like the ending because it wasn't quite what they were looking expecting, but I thought it was great, and rather sweet as well.\\n\\n\r\n     I guess the biggest problem with Toradora as a whole is that it holds back itself by simply being what it is, and yes I intend to explain that further. What I mean is that while Toradora takes what it has and develops it wonderfully, it still doesn't manage to break free of the shackles of the stereotypes and archetypes it has surrounded itself with. It's still an \"anime rom-com\" at heart, which means for all the great drama there is plenty of melodramatic moments, for all the great dialouge there is a couple exchanges that will no doubt make you groan, and hell, there's even a little fan-service along for the ride(though it's thankfully very, very scarce). Now, I'm not trying to say you can't craft an amazing story out of a very familiar premise. For example, the manga Stealth Symphony managde to take the typical shounen formula, setting, and protagonist and practically transforms every aspect of it into something unique and entertaining by the end, practically deconstructing its entire world, but despite this, it still is true to what it is, never feeling like a satire or a genre deconstruction. So yes, despite the archetypes and despite the setting, I think Toradora still could have been able to craft them into something that was so good that the familiar formula did not matter. I just don't think it quite gets there. Which is a shame, but nowhere near a deal-breaker.\\n\\n\r\nA common criticism I've seen of Toradora is that it's predictable: that it isn't hard at all to determine who is going to end up with who by the end of the series, and I've got a couple of mixed feelings about this problem. First yes, you can pretty much see where the entire series is going from the second episode, not all the great twists or development or emotional scenes, but you'll probably get an idea of the final placement of things. On the other hand though, the anime doesn't really have any intentions of trying to conceal the end placement of the relationships of the characters, in fact, you could argue that it spoils the ending in the very first episode, and it does this because the anime has a point to make and a moral to teach, and regards anything that would stimulate contextual tension, well, I wouldn't say irrelevant, but rather less important than the message. That's great and all, and I appreciate that Toradora never really backs down from that stance and tries to make unnecessary drama, but at the same time, tension and uncertainty are very important tools in keeping your audience engaged with your story, and without either for the most biggest question of the entire show... is a questionable decision, at least in my opinion. I recognize that this won't be as much as a problem for some people, or others might not pick up on the message so it won't matter, but still, I felt I needed to address that before I moved on. Now, let's talk about characters.\\n\\n\r\nSo for characters, I'm going to do something a little different. There's five main characters of this show that you need to remember, and I'm going to tackle them out of order for the most part, just so I can save what I really want to talk about for last. But first, our main character: Ryuugi, how does he hold up as a character? Well, I'm sorry to say, not great. Despite other archetypes in the show getting development to justify their behavior, Ryuuji very much stays in the role of \"the nice guy\" for the entirety of the show, and he doesn't exactly have any interesting conflict or drama, he just mostly tries to do what he thinks is best for everyone. What I do want to talk about, and what I consider the only really interesting part to his character is how the show turns those good intentions against him, particularly at the end of a certain arc, where it's brought into question whether Ryuuji tries to help people without truly knowing how to fix their problems, and ends up making the situation worse. It's a rather cool idea, but sadly it doesn't get brought up too much, so ultimately,while he isn't a bad character, sadly our lead looks rather flat compared to the rest of the cast.\\n\\n\r\n     Minori is the target of Ryuuji's affections, his crush throughout the show, and who he seeks to get closer to for its entire duration. She is a cheerful, optimistic girl who, in the words of Ryuuji \"is as radient as the sun\", who looks to spread merriment wherever she may be, which allows her to deal with Taiga's quirks or whoever else she might be dealing with, like a character I'll be talking about in a little bit. However, this personality cloaks a girl with serious issues when it comes to how she views other people and herself, a cloak that the anime spends plenty of time slowly stripping away to show the rather depressed girl inside. Now, I recognize that Minori's character as a concept is nothing exactly new, but you rarely see this kind of character as well developed t as she is, and not in terms of huge revelations, but rather that the anime provides a very clear reason for every action she takes in the anime, even if those reasons are sometimes buried under layers of subtly or metaphor. And on a personal note, her character's resolution in the last episodes is by far my favorite in the entire show; just see for yourself, it's just awesome.\\n\\n\r\n     I think Kitamura's character was sort of pushed to the side to make room for the development of the other characters. He's by far the worst and least focused on character of the anime, only getting a single arc to himself, which means that all his development needed to happen in that single arc, which means that said development is rushed and not very well handled. In his role as Taiga's crush, Kitamura sort of plays the role of the down-to-earth character, one of the only ones who recognizes all the barriers that his friends have put around themselves and allows him to see people for how they truly are, which is why he makes friends with Ryuuji despite the rest of the class being scared away by his looks and eyes. But there's also a slight problem in there, because while the anime tells us that Kitamura and Ryuuji are best friends they rarely act like it, Kitamura almost being in the role of the \"knowledgeable-onlooker\" for the whole show. Rather stale as a character really.\\n\\n\r\nAmi is best girl, and if you disagree, we can chose a time and place to fight later, for now, I want to defend my answer. By \"best girl\", I don't mean Amy was the one I was rooting to end up together with Ryugi at the end of the anime(I was more or less on Team Palm-Top Tiger for the whole time), but what I mean that Ami is probably the most interesting character in the entire show, so let me explain why. Introduced in episode 5, Ami is a child-hood friend of Kitamura, who due to her stunning beauty, works as a model and spends time outside of school of the first four episodes of the anime. However, her sweet and dainty personality is nothing but an act she puts on for her classmates and acquaintances, hiding a cold and manipulative girl who views herself above others and is not afraid to verbally abuse anybody she doesn't like. That of course, until she meets her match in Taigi, Ryuuji and Minori. I say that she's the best character because she's the one who most illustrates the message of the show while still being to go through her own well-paced arc, trying to earn the admiration of classmates by changing her personality, but she's ultimately a tragic character, because she can't earn the admiration and love of the people she actually respects because they see her not as the perfect model that she projects, but rather a normal girl. She's also the one to voice of one of Toradora's most interesting themes, that is \"love vs admiration\", which I won't spoil for you, because I want it to be something you think about for yourself when the anime raises it, but I think it also speaks volumes for her character and development.\\n\\n\r\n    And now it's finally time to talk about the main heroine of the anime, the Palm-Top Tiger: Aisaka Taiga, and I must say, I love this girl; she's one of the most enduring characters I've come across in anime. Taigi is a tsundere beyond a doubt, but like Minori, the show takes the archetype to its full potential, going into detail of what circumstances would drive a person to adapt a \"tsundere\" personality, and this of course leads her to being the second-best character in the anime, only second to Ami. However beneath her hot-headed surface personality, Taiga is revealed to be a somewhat clumsy and quirky girl, unable to control her own emotions which leads to her making bad decisions, which is why having a best friend like Minori(and of course Ryuugi) to control her, is so good for Taiga, as they are able to look past her pride and sarcasm to help the well-meaning girl underneath. And while her tsundere personality traits get a little tiring in the first half of the anime on occasion, she does somewhat \"drop the act\" in the second half, as you discover the true reasons behind her personality. I know she's the main focus of the show for all intensive purposes, and with that should come perks for her character, but she's well handled as a character no matter how you look at it, a tiny, fierce, sweet, strong, prideful tiger that at the end of the day, just wants the best for the people she cares about... plus, she's kind of adorable as well, if we're being honest.\\n\\n\r\nAs we move into animation, I'm sorry to say that J.C Staff won't exactly impress anybody with their work here. Their studio has never been particularly the \"crisp-of-the-cream\" in terms of animation(in fact I think the only time they impressed me with their animation quality was in Railgun S), but still, considering how good this show actually is, I would have liked to see some extra effort put in. Colors and backgrounds are extremely bland, making the anime miss some vibrancy and life in certain scenes, plus, character designs are pretty standard as well(beside Taigi, strangely). It very standard looking, which is why I appreciate even more how the production value seemed to go up as the anime continued. Now, admittedly, this just might be me hallucinating, but I swear everything in general looker better in the second half of the anime, particularly the last few episodes. What I can confirm is that the animation production will increase exponentially during scenes of great importance in the latter stages of the show, and they do look very nice, giving even more power to scenes that are emotional and well-written on their own, so thank you for at least that J.C Staff. Overall though, it's nothing too special. \\n\\n\r\nThe same goes for the OST. Thought the music was done by Yukari Hashimoto, who has done some actually rather brilliant OSTs such as Mawaru Penguindrum and Yuri Kuma Arashi, Toradora's is rather standard, plenty of cheerful slice of life jingles and calm piano pieces inter-cut with various instruments. It's not all bad I guess, and some tracks such as \"Kaze no Kiite\" and \"Psychocandy\" are rather catchy and upbeat, which do well for background music, if nothing else. However, there is one song within this OST that I can safely categorize as brilliant, and that is the song \"Lost My Pieces\", a truly haunting yet beautiful song ripe with emotion, that plays during one of the biggest emotional high points of the show, and damn is it effective. As for openings, I know a lot of people prefer the admittedly catchy first OP: \"Pre-Parade\", but I find it a little annoying to be honest, and much prefer the second opening \"Silky Heart\".\\n\\n\r\nIt took me awhile to actually figure out how much I liked Toradora. As much praise as I've been giving it, it was always in the back of my mind that this was at its core just another slice-of-life/romance, but at the same time, I was wondering how much I could actually penalize the anime for that. However, through writing this review and taking a look back at the show a few months after I initially finished it, I've come to the conclusion that I sort of love this anime. Yes, it's cliche or maybe even melodramatic at poinst, and yes, some characters are sacrificed for others, particularly the supporting cast, and hell, even if I don't, I know a lot of people hate the ending. But for me, Toradora at the end of the day is absolute proof that an anime can be more than the sum of its parts, that it can take all of these things and situations we've seen so, so many other times, and turn them into probably one of the best slice-of-life/romance anime we will ever see. And yeah, I know that's a big statement, but after looking at the thematic under-pinning, and the characters, and how well built up almost everything in the anime actually is, I find that Toradora makes it onto the list of anime that I can completely recommend no matter who you are, because it truly has something for everyone, and it truly has a profound point to make that we all can and should take to heart and apply to our lives. And hell, there's not a lot of pieces of entertainment in mediums that can say that. So yes, the Palm-Top Tiger has won me over at the end, and I'm thoroughly pleased to be counted as one of the people who love this anime.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: 8/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nFor this review and others, feel free to check out my blog!

            "content": "First of all, if you're into Romantic Genres, you'll LOVE this, if you like School Life Themes, you'll LOVE THIS, in fact if you like anything you'll LOVE TORADORA!(Contains heavy Spoilers, not reccomended to read if you haven't watched it)\r\nToraDora has a very interesting story, probably the reason why I keep on watching it, I love it. Taiga loves Kitamura(which is Ryuuji's Friend) while Ryuuji loves Minorin(Taiga's friend) sound simple? as if, Both Taiga and Ryuuji really doesn't feel comfortable talking to the people they like so they decide to both help each other. That's the story in a nutshell, but what makes the storyso epic is how they develop their feelings for each other. The story is indeed a bit cliche however, how they develop it is interesting. The fact that they go from accomplice to lovers is what I found very outstanding. They go through life not noticing that the person they love is actually just right beside them. Indeed a very Interesting Story. I have got to say that the ending is also very fitting and I liked it very much!\\n\\n\r\nI got nothing more to say to the art apart from it's decent, I liked the way they drew everyone, it's brilliant and I couldn't wish for anything more. Although to be honest with you, Ryuuji doesn't look THAT scary =), other than that, it's good.\\n\\n\r\nSound, probably the only thing I don't like about ToraDora, I don't hate it, it's just not my cup of tea. However, even if I didn't like the sound, it is very fitting, the cute atmosphere that the opening gives is good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters, Aside from the storyline the characters plays a vital point in the story itself, if it wasn't for the characters it wouldn't be such a good anime. \\n\\n\r\nRyuuji is what you would call scary, yet very admirable inside, he's easily misunderstood because of his appearance. Looks can be deceiving. He is caring and helped taiga \"survive\" everyday life by giving her comfort and food. He also want to make Taiga very happy, which is probably the reason why I liked this character. She helps her with her communication difficulties and even helped her make decisions that she would probably never done herself. She Likes Minorin, and tries very hard, however he is too shy to express his feelings.\\n\\n\r\nTaiga is what you would call Tsundere - I.E. a violent human outside yet in the inside is a caring girl. She is very interesting in the fact that she can't seem to do anything right! she needs ryuuji(and was shown through the last few episodes of the anime itself) to live life. She Likes Kitamura to the point where she can barely talk to him. She also has a very special relationship with Ryuuji, the fact that he takes care of her is a special bond between Taiga and Ryuuji. She wants Ryuuji to be Happy by confessing to Minoring, however she regrets that because deep inside she likes Ryuuji, she cries and regrets. She actually Loves Ryuuji and in fact looking back at it now she loved Ryuuji from the start.\\n\\n\r\nKitamura, is also yet another interesting character, he doesn't dislike Taiga and in fact he got rejected by Taiga before. He likes the Student Council president very much that he'd actually die for her. He is very caring and doesn't want to hurt anybody. But he'd do anything for his Love, to the extreme point.\\n\\n\r\nMinorin, is probably my favourite character, she is sweet, air headed but very cunning, she knows taiga the most in the series and that fact is vital to the ending of the story itself. She blows off fear by being very lively, that's one of the reason why Ryuuji liked her. She doesn't like anyone though she reveals that she liked Ryuuji in the end however she thinks that Taiga is what best for Ryuuji, she sacrificed her love for her friend, I really loved Minorin.\\n\\n\r\nAmi, is a very dark and distinct character that works behind the scenes most of the time. She is afraid to show her true colours as she wants people to believe that she's actually evil inside, she has show her true colours on the main characters. She goes through her life as a model, she has a stalker, but she couldn't find the courage to stand up for herself, instead Ryuuji helped her to face her fear. She, only hinted, loves Ryuuji because of the fact that Ryuuji would like her for what she is and not for what she isn't. She is indeed an interesting character.\\n\\n\r\nThe Enjoyment of the show is 100% 100/10. I love it, in fact it took me less than 24 hours to actually watch the whole show, that's how much I love it. The Comedy and the Romance scene are very well put, if I was a bit more emotional I'd have cried through the series. Cry laughing and Cry sad. I would've also cried on how I wanted so much more of ToraDora, but that's how it is.\\n\\n\r\nOverall a very outstanding anime. Reccomended!",

            "content": "*sigh*\r\nYou know, I\u2019m starting to lose all hope when it comes to romance / slice of life anime as they tend to either go in a certain way: they try to be outrageously funny and/or dramatic but it ends up being only one or the other and I\u2019m left cold feeling that have doing nothing remarkable or distinctive to make me care about the characters, what they go through and the story as a whole and if you wondered what title made me like this, let\u2019s say that I\u2019m all out of LOVE for this genre. But, then, there\u2019s Toradora and I have heard mixedthings about the series (few either good than bad) but I don\u2019t have the biggest expectations for the show.\\n\\n\r\nDespite Ryuji Takasu\u2019s gentle personality, his eyes make him look like an intimidating delinquent. Class rearrangements on his second high school year put him together with his best friend, Yusaku Kitamura, and his hidden crush, Minori Kushieda. Along with these two comes Kushieda\u2019s best friend, Taiga Aisaka. Her delicate appearance contrasts with her brutal personality. Secretly in love with Kitamura, Taiga agrees to help Ryuji with his love interest as long as he helps her get closer to hers.\\n\\n\r\nNow, as first it may seem like this is going to be some typical love story where the main guy tries to get with this girl by the help of the girl\u2019s said friend and that said friend wants to hook up with the main guy\u2019s best friend and then it turns out that those two might fall in love with each other. BUT\u2026..it actually ends up being more than that. The show illustrates that love is a complicated thing and if something comes crumbling down, no one is going to be left unscathed emotionally, no matter how well you try to hide it. Originally, I was drawn by the comedic aspects of the show as I did had myself a great laugh throughout the earlier episodes but once it gets into the dramatic episodes later on, I was hooked and invested in knowing how the characters will progress throughout. One aspect of the show never overshadowed the other as both the comedy and drama are rightfully balanced without a hint of overexerted awkwardness in the writing.\\n\\n\r\nI really appreciated how the characters in the show remain to be interesting and likable despite being some clich\u00e9d character-types at first but they are portrayed as realistic characters and the show equally get in-depth with them as the show goes on. At first, I thought Taiga was just going that annoying tsundere type that I loathe in anime so much, but eventually, she turns out to be an endearing character and reasons why she is what she is (i.e. coming from a broken home, parents don\u2019t give a damn) and how she does stand up for her friends various times and is straight to the point honest. Ryuuji is somebody that isn\u2019t a spineless male lead nor an off-the-wall perverted idiot lead, but a level-headed genuine character that doesn\u2019t come off as Gary Stu-ish or manufactured as he does have his inner struggles to challenge through. Yusaku, to me, can be often funny and OK but he wasn\u2019t really that important of a character to me to get fully invested but he does have a moment in that in the latter half of the series. But the ones to get me fully invested are Minori and Ami. For Minori, she does seems like the energetic best friend character with a nice girl personality that I really did like at first but she really progresses from that as she show signs of her not confronting her true feelings that she seems like a coward even though she does care for her friends. Ami on the other hand, I never would have expect to like someone as her being a bitch-in-sheep\u2019s clothing character but honestly she wants more in friends than just having followers and admirers and while often she does pick on Taiga, she does care if anything were to happen to her.\\n\\n\\n\r\nJ.C. Staff animated this production and it was a great effort from their part. However, this is nothing I would call new but more of the standard fare I expect from them as the artwork is gorgeous and the movement is performed smoothly and fluid within the context of the show. Character designs are also much to the standard of many anime characters but it is nothing over-the-top or fan service related but manageable.\\n\\n\r\nFor the music portion, \u201cPre-Parade\u201d, the 1st opening theme performed by the main three female leads (Rie Kugimiya, Yui Horie, and Eri Kitamura) does set the mood for the series\u2019 first half and I got to say, this is a decent track with some small flaws in it like it does sound like it\u2019s over-produced in some areas but I actually like the track enough to not skip it. The 2nd opening theme, \u201csilky heart\u201d, also appropriately set the tone during the latter half of the series remarkably acceptable. The rest of the music delivers the dramatic moments spot-on as did the ending themes, \u201cVanilla Salt\u201d and \u201cOrange\u201d, which sounds like ingredients for a cake than a song.\\n\\n\r\nNow when I say this show was a surprise to me being good, there is also another surprise.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTHIS SHOW ACTUALLY HAS AN ENGLISH DUB!!!!\\n\\n\\n\r\nNo, really. This show is licensed by NIS America and normally they do sub-only anime releases and this is their first English dub release and also with the dub being done by Bang Zoom Entertainment and with director Alex Von David on the helm. I\u2019m also proud to say that this is a damn good\u2014no, a damn great dub!! Mainly, it\u2019s because BZ is doing a slice-of-life show for once since recently they have only been dubbing action anime titles for some time and I think the dub shows off the VA\u2019s acting range a bit more. Erik Scott Kimerer and Cassandra Lee Morris give out great performances as Ryuuji and Taiga. Johnny Yong Bosch was rather fine as Yusaka, usually the standard from him but he did his part exceptionally. Personally I think the standouts goes to both Christine Marie Cabanos as Minori and Erika Harlacher as Ami. Cabanos unquestionably delivers more to her acting range as Minori during the dramatic moments as well as her comedic scenes. Most of her comedic scenes did felt like a preview of what to see her as Mako in Kill La Kill (which I\u2019m dying to see in the English dub, BTW). Harlacher sounds very natural as Ami, maintaining both the bitchiness and reasonableness in the character without feeling too overbearing or over the top and this is practically the actress\u2019 best role yet.\\n\\n\r\nFINAL VERDICT: Toradora is a complete surprise from me. Here I was expecting to be some run of the mill clich\u00e9 romance anime but I got something more from this. Everything from the characters, the basic storyline and the soundtrack was executed well despite being plain on paper. Has this made me look at slice of life romantic anime in a different light? Maybe. This show gave me hope for this genre of anime and I hope future titles can learn from this show and how to make me care for the story, the characters and how they\u2019re able to manage that. Toradora, you are definitely a title that I recommend to people. I should\u2019ve never doubted you.\\n",

            "content": "Toradora! is one of those animes that immediately pop into my mind when someone asks me for a rom/com recommendation. It's simply a must-watch if you're a fan of rom/com. Even if you aren't a typical watcher of these kinds of shows, Toradora! is definitely a great first step into that world. \r\nSTORY:\r\nToradora! follows a typical plot: a guy named Takasu Ryuuji has a crush on a girl, who just happens to be his neighbor's best friend. Coincidentally, the neighbor, Aisaka Taiga, has a crush on Takasu's best friend, Yuusaka Kitamura. The two team up and try to help each other get their targets throughtheir adventures. But as the story introduces more characters and progresses from its light-hearted comedy to its heavy drama, the story evolves from its cliche'd plot and takes on a much deeper story. And while many animes are able to conduct such a transition, Toradora! is one that is able to do so subtly and beautifully. \\n\r\n10/10.\\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\r\nI'm not particularly picky about the art for animes, and to be completely honest, there's nothing special about the art for Toradora!. But it's definitely visually appealing and is well done. The only issue I had was he striking similarity between Kawashima Ami and the Student Countil President. The two were so similar I constantly confused one for the other when they were both introduced. Other than that, I thought the art was great. \\n\r\n9/10.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nWhen an anime has a great OP, I never skip it for each episode. Unfortunately, that didn't happen with Toradora!. While the first OP was quite catchy when I first heard it, it soon became something I just skipped to get to the show. Generally, the music was nothing special, especially during the light-hearted scenes. But the more touching moments of the anime had wonderful music that practically drove me to tears. Many dramatic scenes with crying characters or fights sent shivers done my spine as my vision started to blur in front of the screen. Such music was simply nicely fit into such moments and I couldn't describe it any other way. \\n\r\n10/10.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:\\n\r\nThe characters at first appear to be two dimensional. But they have a lot more to them later when the story really hits the dramatic point. At that point, a lot of the characters' different sides and hidden desires are revealed and each changing angle is so interesting. I can't go into too much detail without spoiling the story, so unfortunately I cannot substantiate my view. The characters are all lovable with their quirks and moments, especially Aisaka Taiga. She was by far my favorite character throughout the whole anime. \\n\r\n9/10.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\r\nWith the unique execution and traversal of such an cliche'd story, I was well caught off-guard with such a emotional ride. The music and the story just blended together to create something that was truly amazing. I cried plenty and was hungry for more after I finished the series. It got so bad that afterwards, I went into a state of depression because I couldn't find anything like Toradora! \\n\r\nToradora! definitely remains as one of the animes at the top of my list.",

            "content": "If anime series can be compared to culinary dishes, then Toradora is without a doubt the Green Papaya Salad of this medium. It adheres to the guidelines of its peers yet, with its unabashed creativity, it distinguishes itself from the rest of the salads (or, in Toradora\u2019s case, the rest of the rom-com series). It\u2019s enriched by its irresistible sweetness yet the sugary sprinkles fail to disguise its more desultory features. It\u2019s simply overflowing with fiery passion and yet there are more than a few instances where its energy becomes excessive. The Green Papaya Salad is an acquired taste more than anything else, a dishthat burrows it way into your heart bite by bite. Toradora is that dish.\\n\\n\r\nLike most people, I regard my years in high school, my freshman year in particular, as one of the most unforgettable experiences in my entire life.I remember jeering at the B-movie flicks that my English teacher forced us to watch, I remember skipping my exams to chill at the McDonald\u2019s down the street from the school. I remember stealing soda cans from the vendors at football games with my friends. I remember screwing around with my man Andre during our cross country practices; we intentionally ruined several drills at the JROTC camp that was near where we practiced, we tried figuring out shortcuts in our exercises, and I loved it. Nostalgia is among the most powerful emotions in the human psyche and yet this medium has struggled mightily to capture that nostalgia in its high school-oriented series. The Haruhi Suzumiya franchise attempted to express feelings of sentimentality for the pre-collegiate years but the effort fizzled out over time. Nichijou tried as well, albeit not as much as the Haruhi franchise, but ultimately it\u2019s simply too consumed in absurdity for anyone to reminisce on their early years. Toradora, however, is the only series I\u2019ve seen that flawlessly portrays the misty-eyed wistfulness of high school; it\u2019s the one show that inspires pathos-filled conversations that begin with \u201cI used to know someone in high school that was exactly like that\u201d or \u201cI remember when my friends and I did something like that.\u201d Toradora\u2019s excellence in its nostalgia factor is based on its interesting outlook on normal facets of the high school experience (like the student council), its overwhelming realism in its setting (extremely rare for mainstream anime these days) and its relatable protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nRyuuji Takasu is Toradora\u2019s central character/narrator; he\u2019s a likable neat freak with an apathetic worldview (think of Ryuuji as Kyon 2.0). What really defines him as a person, however, is his unwavering selflessness, and it impacts practically every action he takes throughout the series. Unfortunately, the character that most Toradora fans gravitate towards isn\u2019t Ryuuji; not the one that receives the most depth, not the one that you\u2019d feel any long-term sympathy towards. NO, it\u2019s Taiga Aisaka. A mercurial midget with ratty brown hair, her screen time is consistently soured by her irritatingly entitled attitude (watching Taiga discover new ways to frustrate me inspires comparisons to Emi Yusa, a tsundere like Taiga, and her tiresome antics in The Devil is a Part-Timer). More than any other tendency, Taiga\u2019s most unbearable trait has to be her penchant for unleashing larger-than-life temper tantrums. She enters the Rage Zone at the slightest provocation, she destroys anything or anyone that happens to be near the path of destruction, and for the most part, everyone\u2019s okay with it because they\u2019re afraid of her and also because\u2026..\\n\\n\r\n(wait for it)\\n\r\n(wait for it)\\n\\n\r\n\u2026..Taiga has daddy issues!\\n\\n\r\nLook, I know that among the most appealing aspects of anime its its escapism, its deviation from realistic expectations, but at some point, we have to declare, \u201cEnough is enough.\u201d There have been plenty of Taigas that I\u2019ve encountered in my academic career, plenty of self-centered prima donnas, plenty of edgy iconoclasts known for berating their peers, plenty of female students with hair-trigger tempers, and practically all of them were viewed as social outcasts; at the very least, their behavior was punished. The only just dessert that Taiga receives for her actions is a week-long suspension from school, the equivalent of a slap on the wrist. Fortunately, Taiga develops into a more likable character later in the series, a more tolerable character, a more sympathetic character, but just when you think Taiga\u2019s redeemed herself, her old ways re-emerge at the very end. Well, Taiga had potential. I\u2019ll give her that.\\n\\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, Taiga\u2019s growth is among Toradora\u2019s greatest strengths, for this show shines as a character-centric story more than anything else. The friendships, connections, and chemistry established through the members of the cast is what Toradora is best at, especially when it involves the main characters (a group of five that includes Ryuuji and Taiga). Ami Kawashima is among the group\u2019s members; she\u2019s a self-deprecating cynic that utilizes an innocent facade to disguise her true nature. Like an illusion, Ami pops in and out of each scene, dropping a few snide remarks from time to time but she really knows how to make her presence felt when needed (Her dynamic with Ryuuji is one of this show\u2019s highlights).\\n\\n\r\nYuusaku Kitamura is another member. A rather lighthearted and silly kind of guy, Kitamura is Toradora\u2019s most reliable presence (outside of Ryuuji and Taiga, of course), the mediator of school conflicts, and the object of Taiga\u2019s affections (Johnny Yong Bosch, Kitamura;s English VA, is someone that I\u2019ve held reservations about before but in this role Bosch sounds like he hasn\u2019t had this much fun since Trigun).\\n\\n\r\nAlthough Toradora normally doesn\u2019t do much with its supporting characters, Yasuko Takasu (Ryuuji\u2019s mom) is a notable exception. With her adorable airheadedness, intriguing double entendres and natural charm, Yasuko establishes herself as a star in Toradora\u2019s constellation of characters (Like Bosch, the enthusiasm in Karen Strassman\u2019s portrayal of Yasuko is radiant).\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, Yasuko would\u2019ve been my favorite of the bunch, if not for Minori Kushieda. Minori zigs while Toradora zags. She\u2019s a lightning bolt while everyone else is a square. She\u2019s a Playstation 4 in a room filled with Ataris. Minori isn\u2019t just different from the other characters; she\u2019s universes apart from them. An absolute force of personality, her quirky mannerisms, abiding avidity, and all-around eccentricism produces an overwhelming liveliness in the scenes she appears in. Christine Marie Cabanos completely steals the show in her groundbreaking performance as Minori; her marvelous highs are energetically delivered and her soul-searing lows are beautifully presented as well. Selfless to a fault, Minori constantly sacrifices her happiness and wellbeing for the sake of those she cherishes, and later on it\u2019s flat-out heartbreaking to witness the effect that it has on her character. Ultimately, what Toradora lacks in a respectable female lead, the show more than compensates with the rest of its cast.\\n\\n\r\nDo you remember when Death Parade began airing last year and practically everyone lost their marbles on what was probably the biggest hype train of 2015? (I was admittedly a member of the Death Parade Hype Train back then) Well, one of the most talked-about aspects of the show was its soundtrack. All anyone ever discussed was how gloriously emotional it was when, really, all Death Parade\u2019s OST possessed was one magnificent track (\u201cMoonlit Night\u201d) and an assembly line of subpar somber songs with a jazzy feel to them. Toradora\u2019s soundtrack is of the same vein. Produced by Yukari Hashimoto, the songs in this series are simple, forgettable melodies that are momentarily enjoyable yet fail to fully captivate the audience. Like Death Parade, Toradora\u2019s OST contains a masterfully moving song (\u201cLost my Pieces\u201d) but other than that, it\u2019s hardly noteworthy as a whole. In short, the music in this show has received much more praise from its fans than it warrants and the same could be said of its dramatic appeal. In most cases, the emotions of a human being are akin to combining multiple drinks at a soda dispenser. We usually feel several emotions at once. Our current mood can be normally described in multiple ways. Very rarely do we humans feel only one emotion. Very rarely does our mood morph without warning. That said, the tone, the ambience, the atmosphere in Toradora is like a TV remote. One moment is soothing calmness while seconds later reveals blood-boiling fury. There is no subtlety, no graduality, no realism in how the characters feel. To quote Drake, Toradora\u2019s mood transitions \u201cfrom 0 to 100, nigga, real quick\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nThe entertainment industry, as a whole, has established a name for itself as the dwelling where strange yet wonderful occurrences happen, and one of them is something I like to call \u201cThe Leap\u201d. \u201cThe Leap\u201d is a somewhat rare event in which a fairly worthwhile series recognizes its shortcomings and attempts to destroy them; as a byproduct, the series undergoes a period of significant all-around improvement. Basically, by repairing its faults, a good series becomes a great one. This is \u201cThe Leap\u201d. For Toradora, \u201cThe Leap\u201d commenced during Kitamura\u2019s character arc, a controversial two-episode storyline that many have complained about but it\u2019s one I enjoyed. As Kitamura endured a rebellious phase, Toradora spared some time to include other characters into the plot, like perennial slacker Kouji Haruta and straight-laced Hisamitsu Noto. Its emotional appeal progressed into something that was authentic and meaningful, its mood transitions developing with a measure of realism. It even bothered to include a couple of excellently animated (albeit brief) school fights (For someone who once viewed them as something of a religion, this was an additional bonus). For a while, it seemed as though Toradora could do no wrong; it was invincible.\\n\\n\r\nLike all good things, Toradora\u2019s Leap, the show\u2019s awe-inspiring run of excellence, sputtered to a stop in the penultimate episode, It\u2019s at that point where each and every one of Toradora\u2019s deficiencies slithered their way to the forefront: its exclusion of everyone outside of the five central characters (and eventually three out of the five as well), its subpar soundtrack, its spontaneous tonal shifts, and even Taiga\u2019s tsundere tendencies. In the end, the only thing that Toradora\u2019s Leap did was temporarily repair its weaknesses (It\u2019s almost like threading the ripped sleeve of a shirt back together and then wearing that shirt every day. Eventually, that sleeve will rip again). Despite its faults and its methods of fixing them, Toradora remains a show I\u2019d recommend. It\u2019s mesmerizing in its portrayal of high school, efficient in constructing bonds between characters, and excellent more often than not when it comes to humor. It makes you smile with its corniness and intrigues you with its intellect. Its first OP (\u201cPre-Parade\u201d) might even cause your head to bob back and forth. All in all, Toradora is hardly perfect but, for better or worse, it never fails to be interesting, just like the Green Papaya Salad.",

            "content": "Toradora is easily one of the worst anime around. It can't decide if its a romance/comedy or a romance/drama. Combine that with some of the worst characters ever and you have the final product.\r\nStory:\r\nThe story is bland. It has been done so many times before the word clich\u00e9 doesn't do it justice. You know the ending within the first 5 minutes of episode 1. \r\nIt is very slow-paced. A 25 episode series that could have very easily been done in 15. It spends time on pointless scenes that are irrelevant to the main series and feel more like a filler episode of a popular long-runningshounen.\\n\\n\r\nI will admit, the comedy scenes at the beginning were funny. However, an intelligent viewer will quickly realise the comedy is playing off of the female MC's tsundere archetype and the jokes become painful to watch. \\n\\n\r\nThe drama was forced and melodramatic, especially for a series not even tagged as a drama on MAL. The feeble attempts to provoke an emotional response were poorly written and painful to watch.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe animation isn't bad but it isn't good. The backgrounds are decent but there is nothing particularly memorable regarding the art.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe series use two opening themes which would have been very fitting if it hadn't had so much melodrama which makes the themes seem more suitable for a series with more comedy.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST is average at best. The composer didn't really have his own style which made the music seem bland and uninspired. \\n\\n\r\nSome of the songs fit the scene but you won't notice them unless you focus on the music.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe worst part of Toradora.\\n\\n\r\nThe male MC is a teenager who is isolated from his class mates because of his appearance. You know who else doesn't have any friends? Otaku.\\n\r\nHe is too shy to tell a girl he likes her. You know who else is very shy? Otaku.\\n\r\nYou can see where I am going with this.\\n\r\nThe male MC is basically otaku-pandering.\\n\r\nI also view the MC as being a poor rip-off of Clannad's male MC. They both have few friends and are considered delinquents and both have blue hair. \\n\\n\r\nThe female MC is easily the worst character ever written. She is the personification of the tsundere archetype which shows poor writing and a lack of creativity of the author's part. By the time the show gets started on her character development you already hate her so much you don't care. Additionally, all her issues in the show could be resolved if she stopped being a bitch. Her voice actor only makes matters worse. Its Rie Kugimiya, need I say more?\\n\\n\r\nThe side character are a mixed bag. Minori is just as bad as Taiga but for different reasons. Namely a bipolar personality and generally being an annoyance. The other two ,Kitamura and Ami, are actually decent but are thrown to the side for the worse characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nIt took me two months to finish this, purely because I don't drop shows. I felt my IQ getting lower as I watched each episode. It isn't enjoyable. I'm certain that listening to Rie Kugimiya's voice is a method of torture at guantanamo bay.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nIt could have been a decent show if the story wasn't so clich\u00e9 and the characters weren't so poorly written. It had some good scenes that were held back by reasons previously stated. Scenes that seem significant later become redundant and everything is so predictable. As a fan of the romance genre I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Yeah, the characters were kind of unique and well put. But then there was these characters that weren't in need of being there. Instead of developing on Taiga, Ryuuji and their best friends' relationships, they just wasted time by putting in events and characters to draw time. 20 episodes of nothing. 5 episodes equal the development and actual romance. The end was great, I guess, and when we saw them progressing on their relationship it was great. Butthat was only a small amount of the whole series.\\n\\n\r\nSorry if this review was confusing. That it's my first review and that I watched the anime a year ago should explain it.",

            "content": "Quick Synopsis: \r\nRyuji and Taiga find out through an amusing accident that each of them has a crush on the others best friend. They form a loose agreement to play the other\u2019s cupid, but because taiga lives alone and also right next door, they end up eating together, waking each other up in the mornings and going to school together, all in the name of their matchmaking ploy. Both of them are mushy messes around their heartthrobs, so they spend much more time with each other, plotting the next hookup or going through various trials in their friendship and only wind up with a fewseverely awkward moments with their targets.\\n\\n\r\nStory&Characters\\n\r\nIt\u2019s easy to pass off Toradora as just another tsundere romantic comedy with the same gags, character archetypes, character pathologies, and sitcom-esque setups that create awkwardly romantic situations. Indeed the characters start out lifeless and generic. The \u201cdere\u201d part of Taiga\u2019s tsundere personality is cloyingly sweet, as if she is a maiden who hasn\u2019t so much as had her skin defiled by the touch of a boy. The \u201ctsun\u201d part is unreasonably disagreeable, violent, and straight up mean. Ryuji always gets this end of her moody personality, and it\u2019s difficult to see any human being with a semblance of pride and self respect standing the insult and humiliation he receives from Taiga, but he actually begs for more. Only a diagnosis of a severe masochistic disorder along with horrible self esteem could explain that. Suffice it to say the two main characters have an unnatural and off putting relationship at first. As the series moves on, it switches gears completely, but gradually, to a high school drama. The objects of the two main characters\u2019 affections, a hyperactive girl, Minori, and an overly enthusiastic brown noser, Yuusaku, who were nothing more than gag fodder in the earlier half, as most side characters in tsundere/harem romantic comedies are, become fully fleshed out, though not particularly nuanced characters. In fact, the gags all but disappear after the halfway mark. Taiga, though still easily categorized as \u201ctsundere,\u201d becomes almost unrecognizable from what she was early on in the series. Her character mellows out a lot; she gets to be more apologetic, and because of this, her relationship with Ryuji, though still on the sadomasochistic side, at least resembles a healthy friendship.\\n\\n\r\nThe series then goes all out Asian Soap Opera, pulling out love geometry complex enough to stump a math major, family dysfunction, and the ubiquitous trials that friendships are put through due to crushes and the resulting jealousy; basically every trick a typical Asian TV drama has for dragging the tears out. Toradora is indulgent with the melodrama, and it\u2019s hit or miss. It\u2019s usually quite deft when it comes to the central romance and family problems. The situations and the ways the characters face them feel genuine, enough so that most people probably can find some common denominators in their personal experiences. The love and affection is surprisingly down to earth given the tsundere premise. No tearful kisses, thank god. The same amount of melodrama is applied to the characters\u2019 friendships, but not to the same effect. Jealousy is the culprit of nearly every friend-to-friend conflict in the series, but melodrama is something that inherently does not suit that emotion. Envy is brooding and dark, not loud and whiny. There is but one character that comes close to expressing jealousy believably, but in the end, she, like all the other side characters, are simply \u201cdealt\u201d with, unnaturally resolving complex issues in simple ways so that the final BFF ending can happen. When melodrama goes wrong, it really goes wrong, and there may be scenes that are corny enough to make you want to plug your ears, close your eyes, and god forbid if you\u2019re watching with a friend, laugh awkwardly to hide the embarrassment from the fact that you actually agreed to watch something so darned cheesy. I can easily see how one might feel differently, but if you ask me, the payoff tear jerkers are worth the occasional bits of torture.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation&Sound\\n\r\nToradora is definitively superior to any other Anime drama I\u2019ve seen in terms of animation. The character designs and vibrant color schemes in clothes and hair are reminiscent of fanservice-y harem gag comedies (which Toradora is quite far from), that is to say, they\u2019re not particularly inspired or impressive, but the characters are consistently well animated, with none of the excessively stiff motions that most high school dramas, especially of the shoujo/josei variety, seem to get away with. Then you have those few sequences with animation beautiful enough to make nearly every action series green. It\u2019s rare enough to see such liberal use of high frame sequences with impressive key animation in any TV series, let a lone a drama. There is one real fight scene, and the rest of these sequences are used on climactic chasing, fleeing, or falling. The fight scene aside, good animation may seem wasted on a drama, but it actually provides a much needed element that Anime sorely misses over its live action counter parts in the same genre: physical expression. The physical expression in Anime melodrama is way too basic. We\u2019ve all seen chase scenes before: the characters run with robotic arm and leg motions, and the only form of physical expression is scrunched eyebrows indicating concern or worry for whoever is being pursued. The same scene in Toradora would have fully animated the pursuer\u2019s body mechanics while sprinting; it would have shown slight random stumbles and slips while turning corners, all of this serves to highlight desperation that when expressed physically adds a layer of emotional depth over some generic verbalized thought like \u201cplease be okay\u2026\u201d\\n\\n\r\nYou would think that the production value would also apply to music, but it\u2019s sadly absent, or so passive and muted that it might as well have been absent at the most crucial, climactic moments of the story.\\n\\n\r\n--\\n\\n\r\nToradora is well paced in that it weans the viewer from comedy to drama gradually, but it never successfully integrates the two. In the latter half of the series a few old gags pop up very rarely, but they feel forced and unnecessary. People will probably have different opinions on each half of the story. To me, Toradora is generic and uninteresting as a Tsundere comedy. It doesn\u2019t have a knack for laugh out loud humor, and Anime is saturated enough as it is with Tsundere gags. As an angsty, melodramatic high school drama, it\u2019s painful to watch at times, but the frequent tear jerkers and occasional poignancy make the series worth finishing.",

            "content": "I began Toradora thinking it was going to be just another romantic comedy. I had read various reviews, not expecting much from this anime at all, and so allow me to start of my review by saying: Toradora is phenomenal, stupefying, heart-stirring and just plain amazing. It exceeded all my expectations BY FAR and will surely leave a huge impact on rest of my life. After I finished the series, I was lost for words. I literally just sat there staring at my computer screen still astonished at what I have just completed.\r\nThe story of Toradora is unique and realistic. This is not your typicalromantic comedy; it will leave MUCH more of an impact on you. The anime includes various twists and turns that left me pretty much speechless. There are times when you will be laughing your head off and there will be times when it feels like someone stabbed your heart, so when you get that lump in your throat, don't be surprised! What I love about Toradora is its overall message, and although I don't  want to give much out, I want to say that Toradora teaches you what love truly is. It is acquired by being yourself and not being afraid to express your own, true feelings. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is not the best I have ever seen, but it is pretty amazing, still pleasing to the eye. You definitely will not have a problem with the art of Toradora; it is simple and fantastic. There are times when the art is really fitting to the scene, reflecting upon its meaning, leaving me in awe. \\n\\n\r\nToradora's soundtrack is something that doesn't really stand out, but is fitting for the whole anime. When there are comedic scenes, there will be joyful music and when times are getting rough, there will be sad music. It's nothing extraordinary, but needless to say it is still great. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are another reason why I love this anime so much. There are 5 main characters: Ry\u016bji Takasu, Taiga Aisaka, Minori Kushieda, Y\u016bsaku Kitamura and Ami Kawashima. They have a complicated relationship with one another, but that's what makes this so realistic. Friends are not always nice and friendly with each other, but things do happen. Life happens. Each of them have their own unique personalities and fit extremely well with the story line. To be honest, I love all the characters and I can relate to many of them. Be sure to pay attention to the anime because there are so many little details that are extremely important and reveal SO much about the characters. The main female character, Taiga Aisaka, and the main male character, Ry\u016bji Takasu are extremely fun to watch and always managed to steal my attention , getting me completely hooked to the anime. \\n\\n\r\nIf it isn't obvious enough, this anime was beyond enjoyable to me. I loved every single minute and even though I am satisfied with the ending, I can't stop wanting more Toradora. Yuyuko Takemiya did such an amazing job with this anime, and I want to thank them for creating this masterpiece which in my opinion exceeds Clannad. If you don't watch romantic comedies, definitely give this a try, you won't regret it. If you like romantic comedies, I can assure you that you will be more than satisfied with this anime, and hopefully it will leave the same impact on you as it did on me.",

I'm not the be all and end all.\r\nBut to be blunt, I don't just dislike this show. I despise it and everything it stands for.\r\nLet's see: Toradora is supposed to be a rom-com-drom, right? So, how does each category stand?\r\n1. Romance\r\nThe romance is bad. Plain and simple. The connections between Taiga and Ryuuji are barely prevalent throughout the course of the show,barring like maybe the last few episodes, and even then it didn't give me any kind of emotions at all.\\n\\n\r\nThere's rushing your romance, and then there's dragging on for so long you almost forget who's supposed to be with who.\\n\\n\r\nBut hey, I could be interpreting it wrong.\\n\\n\r\n2. Comedy\\n\r\nComedy is subjective, right? Well, in my subjective opinion, this show is dull as fuck when it comes to comedy. Not much to elaborate on here, besides the fact I don't find this show funny.\\n\\n\r\n3. Drama\\n\r\nWell, with the dull romance and comedy, we're left with drama.\\n\\n\r\nAnd well, this show does have drama. Melodrama. And this is where my true hatred for this show comes into play.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not kidding when I say the characters COMPLETELY overreact over the smallest fucking things in this show. \\n\\n\r\nFor instance, your crush gets rejected by his own crush?\\n\r\nGo fucking MURDER her with a wooden sword! Because that's not over reacting!\\n\\n\r\nYour father sometimes neglects you?\\n\r\nFUCKING DESTROY his testicles when you finally see him!\\n\\n\r\nYou didn't give someone a box of chocolates?\\n\r\nWell, overreact over that too, because we don't have enough melodrama in this show!\\n\\n\r\nThe last example isn't a joke by the way. That's literally one of the scenes.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, this show tries to be dramatic just for the purpose of shoehorning in drama. It's almost obnoxious to be honest.\\n\\n\r\nAnd to go over the characters briefly:\\n\\n\r\nRyuuji is forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nTaiga is the worst tsundere ever.\\n\\n\r\nKitamura is forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nAmi exists solely to spew meaningless meaningful words.\\n\\n\r\nAnd Minori is bi, apparently.\\n\\n\r\nIf it wasn't obvious enough, I don't care about anyone in this show.\\n\r\n________________________________________________________\\n\r\nOverall, it's very likely I'm interpreting all of the messages that Toradora gives wrong, and for that reason, I suppose I can see why people actually go as far to say that this is their favourite show.\\n\\n\r\nBut according to my interpretation, Toradora is nothing more than a painfully unfunny, melodramatic failure of a romance.\\n\\n\r\nAt least the music and animation is good.\\n\\n\r\nKudos to whoever actually read my god-awful \"review\".\\n\\n",

            "content": "Why is it that we choose to watch a show rather than just read a synopsis of what happens during it? It's because the value of a show comes from more than just how it sounds when you summarize it: it comes from experiencing it, getting invested in a world other than the one you live in. It comes from the little things.\r\nToradora is all about the little things.\r\nThis is an instance where I feel the MAL system of evaluation breaks down: story, art, sound, character, enjoyment: what does it matter what each of these may be individually when you're never going to experience themindividually? Yes, Toradora's premise isn't all that unique, nor does it deconstruct it or make any particularly unexpected decisions. Yes, the art is solid but not mind-blowing. But the difference between the 1970s animated Lord of the Rings movies and Peter Jackson's epic masterpieces isn't any of that: they're both telling the exact same story. It lies in the execution, the actual process of telling it. I would liken Toradora to Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings in that both of them are a story that we've all seen before, and both of them nevertheless stand apart and above for doing it better, far FAR better, then anything that came before or after them. When you're watching an anime, all that you're ever going to experience is the \"overall\", and so that's the kind of review that I'm writing for Toradora. It's an \"overall\" review. \\n\\n\r\nToradora follows the story of Ryuji Takasu and his high-school adventures with his group of friends, with the main five characters being Taiga, the short, feisty delinquent; Minori, the peppy go-getter; Ami, the vain yet self-conscious model; Kitamura, the upstanding cool-and-collected member of the student council; and Ryuji himself. From the beginning all five of these characters possess an enchanting depth and color, immediately defying the archetypes that we assume them to be. They converse like actual people, with captivating often irrelevant dialogue that is nevertheless extremely enjoyable. It's actually a pretty funny show (believe it or not, given the track record anime has with comedy), with what I found to be some solid laugh-out-loud moments that help to carry it along very nicely.\\n\\n\r\nThe character Ryuji initially grows closest with is Taiga Aisaka, and let me just say that I was absolutely blown away by her character. I've heard it said that Taiga is nothing more than a traditional Tsundere, and I would have to entirely disagree. I would find it hard to even classify her as a Tsundere, or someone who expresses their affection through coldness or aggression. At the beginning of the series it is revealed that Taiga has a crush on Kitamura, and throughout the entirety of the series she is outwardly caring, polite and forthright with him. There's nothing remotely Tsundere about it. This assumption instead spawns from the way that Taiga interacts with most of the other people in her life: she is blunt and easily angered. This stems not from some contrived shyness but rather from a fundamental fear of being rejected by the people she opens up to, a desire to be compassionate that has been buried by personal experience. Taiga's issues are much more deep-seated and pathological, and whilst at the beginning of the series I initially found her to be annoying and vicious, by the end she had essentially taught me to look at people in a different light. You DON'T know someone else just through a couple of interactions, and you don't know an anime character just because you've watched four episodes of their show. The idea behind Taiga's character is perhaps nothing new, but the WAY in which Toradora handles it is: it's compelling, believable and eye-opening. \\n\\n\r\nTaiga's not the only character the show manages to execute with divine grace: the two other girls, Ami Kawashima and Minori Kushieda (a name that has been forever etched upon my mind) add their own gleam to the outstanding cast. I don't want to go nearly as much into what makes them amazing for spoiler reasons, but I will say this: Minori Kushieda is without a doubt one of my favorite characters of all time. Ryuji himself is a very solid male lead: we've all seen the dark-haired young male protagonist through which the story is told, but Ryuji definitely lends it a new flair with his own tragically fitting yet often hysterical eccentricities involving cooking and cleaning, and his subtly masochistic nature. He also hits a perfect balance between being able to handle situations in a mature manner and not being turned into a Gary-Stu like SAO's Kirito. He's an intelligent boy who knows what he wants and isn't afraid to voice his opinions, but he can get hot-blooded or embarrassed and loses much of his functionality around his crush.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of crushes, do you like romance? Because that's where Toradora really tips the balance from \"amazing character study\" to \"one of the all-time best\" for me. \\n\\n\r\nToradora: a romance like no other. Not because of some bold decision it makes, just because of the Toradora way: taking what has already been done and doing it that much better. I have said before that Toradora gets what love is, and I stand by that. It doesn't romanticize it or glorify it, it shows it for what it is: messy, confusing, difficult and beautiful. It has a grasp on real chemistry, and its romance feels as though it springs not from the creator's decisions but from the decisions that the actual characters would make. Feelings are not eternal: they change a bit with each new day, and what we experience can either reinforce or alter them. People are not \"meant\" for each other, and relationships are not founded on the simple joy of mutual affection: they take work, patience, experience, and time to mature. All of this is and always will be part of love, and its what makes it a wonderful, complex thing. Perfection is woven from the strands of imperfection, and that's what makes love such a perfect thing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall? Overall I give Toradora a \"watch it\". It's one of the greatest things I've ever seen, and it's definitely my favorite romance. If you're seeking plot or action, take a pass on this one. It's simply not for you. But if when you hear \"outstanding characters\" or \"high-school rom-com done right\" your ears perk up and your heart beats a little faster, then open up watchcartoononline.com or whatever site you may use and start on episode 1. Enjoy!\\n\\n\r\n*Note: Despite the controversy I'm sure this will cause, I recommend the dub over the sub. I've watched the series all the way through twice, one in each, and I thought that the dub was stellar and gave the character's voices more individuality. However, this is widely chalked up to personal preference so I wouldn't put too much weight on it.",

            "content": "When it comes to watching anime, I really consider myself more of a marathon runner than a sprinter.  Usually I like to take my time and watch a couple of shows simultaneously, so 24 episode series usually take me like 3 or 4 months to finish.  Therefore it\u2019s something of a testament to how much I liked Toradora! that I wound up finishing it in a mere 12 days.\r\nAdmittedly after watching the first episode I wasn\u2019t overly impressed with the prospects for Toradora!  It seemed like it would be a show with a slightly unique take on the rom-com if nothing elseand be pretty good.  And the first few episodes in the series were very funny and enjoyable but didn\u2019t particularly stand out.  It\u2019s a slice of life/school life series so there isn\u2019t really much in the way of a linear plot but as the series goes on you see the character interactions start to become more significant and the comedy takes a backseat in order for more serious issues and developments to be brought up.  The more I watched, the more interested I became in watching how the characters interacted and how the story progressed.  \\n\\n\r\nWhat was great about Toradora! then was that it started off as a light-hearted tale of two misunderstood love-struck teenagers but developed into a great story about growing up and finding your place in the world, even if you are a dragon looking for understanding and acceptance in a world where people think that you want to eat them because of your intimidating appearance.  Personally I love shows that start off with a comedic tone and get more serious as they progress so this was a huge plus for me, plus it had some of the most touching and (Tora)dorable moments of any anime I\u2019ve seen.\\n\\n\r\nFor a slice of life/romance story with a fairly tried-and-true plot to stand out, there tends to be a need for a strong base built in your characters in order to set yourself apart.  This was probably the best aspect of the show because all of the characters were unique, flushed out, and on the whole very likable.  All of the characters were stood out in this anime and I can even say that down to the supporting characters I enjoyed everyone in Toradora!\\n\\n\r\nIn order to see a prime example of why the characters are so great and unique in Toradora!, all we need do is take a look at Ryujii, one of our love-struck protagonists.  Although he has the eyes of a delinquent, which leads people to think that he is a bad person, in all actuality he is one of the kindest, most caring people you could ever meet.  This theme of initial superficial appearances being different from what lies beneath is eventually applied to all of our main characters as the story progresses, which becomes the most interesting, realistic, and gripping part of Toradora! As we are given characters who, over the course of the show, have good development and display a wide range of motivations and emotions.\\n\\n\r\nThe best example of this would probably be a tie between Minori, Taiga\u2019s best friend and Ryujii\u2019s crush, and Ami, Kitamura\u2019s childhood friend and a stupid Chihuahua (at least in Taiga\u2019s eyes).  Minori started off as the sunshine of the show and brought about some of the best comedy in the series.  As the story progressed though, she became gloomy and distant, and her actions seemed totally out of character.  This total change of character and the reasons behind it was one of the aspects of the story that made me frustrated and confused but also kept me interested and made me want to keep watching to discover the reason.  As for Ami, when she was first introduced I figured that she was there to be the bitchy, prissy, \u201ceverybody look at me girl,\u201d which she was for a while.  Once again though as the story progressed she showed that she was the most emotionally perceptive character and that even for someone who seems so mature and has the world figured out, it turns out that she\u2019s just a normal, confused high school kid trying to find her way in life like the rest of them.  The only person who really didn\u2019t seem to stand out to me in terms of character growth or development was Kitamura, Ryujii\u2019s best friend and Taiga\u2019s crush, who seemed mostly to be there for comedic effect in the end.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the main protagonists I have to say that they were also very unique and showed some great depth as well.  Ryujii\u2019s struggles with managing school, household chores, while at the same time trying not to be perceived as a delinquent were very realistic and I liked his generally kind and caring personality.  In addition to that his growth and maturity over the course of the series really developed nicely and he certainly impressed me as a character.  In regards to Taiga initially I have to say I was not very thrilled.  She seemed like she was going to be your typical tsundere with the whole \u201cI\u2019m your master so quit being a perverted dog\u201d relationship with Ryujii for 25 episodes (her being voiced by Rie Kugimiya certainly didn\u2019t help this case either).  Yet as the story went on you see that perhaps she is just socially awkward and doesn\u2019t like her life of being feared and alone.  When you hear about some of the stuff that has happened to her you really have to sympathize.  Not since watching Fruits Basket have I seen parents be such assholes to their children like Taiga\u2019s were to her.  Her developed background over the course of the series really made me like her more and her relationship with Ryujii grew and developed nicely from what it was at the start of the series.  Plus, she loves Christmas.  My stance is that anyone who like Christmas is alright with me.\\n\\n\r\nThe art for Toradora! was absolutely fantastic.  When at first I wasn\u2019t particularly impressed by the story, the art kept me coming back.  Throughout the series it was always consistently great but then at times it seemed like the animators said, \u201cYou know what?  Let\u2019s make the next scene look awesome,\u201d and would then proceed to do so.  Sometimes it was only subtle effects but it was enough to make me love Toradora! for, if nothing else, how unique and impressive it looked.  I have seen other J.C. Staff works and I have to say they really brought their A-game for this production because it looks like none of their other works I\u2019ve seen or anything else I\u2019ve ever seen for that matter.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting in Toradora! was really fantastic as well.  It\u2019s a pretty experienced and well-known cast who I felt all did great, although I particularly enjoyed Yui Horie\u2019s performance as the super-weird and energetic Minori.  When it comes to theme pieces in anime I\u2019m pretty easy to please.  But surprisingly for a show that I loved so much I did not like the theme music at all.  Once again the show was unique in this aspect because the music was like nothing else I\u2019d ever heard before.  Unfortunately for the most part this meant that I just skipped over them or blanked them out, with the exception of the first ending, \u201cVanilla Salt\u201d sung by Yui Horie, which is actually one of my favorite anime pieces of all time now.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end all I can say is that I couldn\u2019t possibly recommend Toradora! any more.  If you\u2019ve dropped it I say go pick it back up.  If you plan on watching it I say go start right now.  There are some things about it that people aren\u2019t going to like, it\u2019s going to be the same for all media and I for one can acknowledge what some of these aspects might be.   However for a show that I enjoyed so much there is no possible way that I couldn\u2019t completely recommend it.  Worst case scenario you waste a few hours of your time and walk away with a nasty taste in your mouth.  However it seems like there's a good chance you\u2019ll walk away after finishing Toradora! having watched a great series.",

            "content": "Alright.  Let me begin by saying I had high hopes for this anime, I legitimately thought that I, like many, would love it and find it one of the best rom coms in a long time.\r\nI cannot say that, and it pains me.  Thus why I feel obligated to write this review, so that those out there, like me, who find themselves on the fence about this show will know that it is not for everyone and could be called a failure in its key aspect.\r\nBut enough of that now, onto the first section.\r\nStory:\r\nThis here is the key to my entire disappointment, thissection will cover the only flaw I find in the show(albeit one which breaks  this show) that's worth a really, really low score.  \\n\\n\r\nAs I intend to keep this spoiler free, I will do my best to be vague and as objective as a human can be.  Anyway, to start off,  I do have to give some sum up.  The show is about two people(Ryuuji and Taiga) who try to help each other find love with their respective friends(Minori and Yuusaku), but end up falling for each other.  Basic.  Simple.  Unusual for anime, but not unheard of in other medium. Yet somehow, the writers fail to appropriately dictate this correctly and botched much of could have made this show great.\\n\\n\r\nNow then, let's point out some positives, as I'm sure you all are sick of my negativity.  This show has a great start, the two leads were fun to watch and their hijinks involved with the rest of the group, especially their attempts to woo their love interests was hilarious.  They kept stale traits of high school anime refreshing with new spins on old ideas that managed to really make them shine in comparison to any other show in the genre.  There's just one problem, there is no romantic chemistry between the leads, no build up in what should have been the best place for us to see them as developing feelings for each other.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, the show almost negates feelings for these two, by showing how much interest each of them has in their two friends, Ryuuji and Minori have some great moments mid series that really show growth in their relationship and for the most part, there is a lot of reason to be seen of Taiga and Yuusaku becoming a genuine couple given time.\\n\\n\r\nWe even get another potential love interest for Ryuuji in Yuusaku's childhood friend, Ami Kawashima, who manages to steal a lot screen time and show a lot of chemistry also Ryuuji.  Which is not something that can be said of the leads and their relationship.  It is rather stagnant, with their characters establishing their relationship in this mess together early and hardly ever changing.\\n\\n\r\nThat is, until the writers realized this error and rushed basically the last quarter of the show with episodes shoving the two down our throats.  Everything becomes about their relationship, everything.  The side characters?   They push it forward or are obstacles that only drag it out another episode.  The story?  In the early series was a great mix of realistic setting with realistic reactions, to realistic settings with either ostentatious reactions or ones that are made entirely to drive the romance plot to its fulfillment in the last episode.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIn case this section is TL;DR:  Most of the show and it's plot are good, but it fails in its most important moments and aspects.   Therefore it gets a 3 in story.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThere is probably nothing bad to say about this show's animation.  It's fluid, energetic, and fits the show like a glove.  So for this section, the show gets a 9.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nNot something I am the most capable of explaining, so forgive my lackluster review of sound.   The music is fun and normally sets the ambience of a scene rather well, but never really hit a nerve in me.  Voice actors were great too, even the dub can probably be found enjoyable or considered decent by most people.  Therefore, for sound, this show gets an 8.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nAh, we come to the absolute best part of this show and the key reason why I still hate how this show ended.  Every character, for the most part, is unique.  They feel like real people you'd meet, rather than fleshed out archetypes of a given cliche.\\n\\n\r\nSave Taiga.  She's a tsundere, and that is who she is, for the most part.  How she develops beyond that is more often a reinforcement or explanation of her tsundere-ness.  It as though the writers crafted from pure tsundere the character that is Taiga, and this works to her benefit and detriment.  By which I mean to say that she pours out a lot of either aspect of tsundere, either she is full on tsun or full on dere.   The show usually managed to balance the aspects out, but there were often times where her tsun was simply overwhelming for those less appreciative of that character trait.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, though, beyond her, the cast is well rounded and, for the most part, real.  They act, they care, and they again, for the most part, grow as people.  It is rare that I find myself so attached to a group of characters, but this show captured my attention almost from episode 1 with them.  They were like friends I would have had in my high school days, which was perfect.\\n\\n\r\nThis section gets a 10, without a doubt.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nI'll keep this section short, as I feel it is best summed up in the other parts.   Like I said, I enjoyed a lot of this show, from the beginning until late midway(give 9 or so eps left in the series), but the last section, where it tries to come all together breaks it, leaving us an ending that I personally found almost tragic, if truly studied beyond its assumed happily ever after, as one realizes much of what was said and done in those last episodes were done in the heat of the moment.  Many of those scenes were also then the cause of this show's end, which unfortunately means a rushed performance for the viewers and likely more than a few mistakes that could end in disaster for the characters.\\n\\n\r\nEven though I had such a great time with this series, the bitter taste in my mouth and realization of the show's true end cannot let me give this part more than a 6.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nTo bring it all around, I did have fun, I probably will still rewatch the earlier episodes on occasion.  But, a show like this thrives on its ending, which leaves a lot to be desired.  A pity, because this show was bound by its promise in concept, it failed to find what really mattered in it.  A story should be dictated by the characters and how they developed throughout, as this leaves them with the greatest, lasting triumph of being close to real.  It came so close, too.\\n\\n\r\nThe overall score is 7, for the earlier episodes, great music, art, and characters.",

            "content": "A decade later and still the high school romcom that all others are to be measured by.\r\nStory: 8\r\nTwo classmates discover the other is in love with their best friend and they team up to set each other up. Nothing revolutionary for sure, but nonetheless an effective foundation for a good romcom. As the story progresses, you can see it turns into something else entirely, with just enough minor twists to prevent it from going to stale. It starts out pretty silly and light, but the drama does ratchet up a bit later in the series. Enough to get me emotionally invested in how it wasgoing to end. Overall for the genre the story is certainly above average, but don't expect to be wowed.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nMore or less what you'd expect from a decade-old romcom. It won't floor you but the character models are decent and definitely expressive.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nThis is one of the few series I have watch in both subbed and dubbed in its entirety, and I will vouch for the quality of both. Taiga's Japanese VA, Rie Kugimiya, in particular stands out for what I consider the defining tsundere performance in anime. Both openings and endings are delightful, and the first OP is especially catchy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nWhat I consider the most important aspect of any show is where Toradora shines the brightest. Let's start with Ryuuji. One of my issues with a decent number of high school romcoms is the uninteresting male MCs. Ryuuji is an exception. Despite his (apparently) menacing face, he is actually a super sweet and likable guy with an affinity for cooking, cleaning, and grocery shopping. Which is why some affectionately (I think) tease him with the moniker \"housewife\". Now on to the rest of the cast. We have Taiga, the tiny tsundere and Ryuuji's partner in crime. There's Minori, the athletic \"genki girl\", whom is the object of Ryuuji's affection. Then we got Kitamura, the bookish vice president and apple of Taiga's eye. And rounding out the main cast is Kitamura's childhood friend Ami, the worldly but initially two-faced model. Not only is it a colorful cast of characters, but the unique interactions between two specific characters, such as Taiga and Ami's bickering, or Minori and Taiga's strong affection for one another, are entertaining to watch. One of the themes of Toradora is a simple one, everyone to some degree wears a mask. Without getting too into spoiler territory, most of the characters in show are not exactly the person they seem to be at first blush.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nI don't often rematch anime, but I enjoyed this one so much the first time in dub, that I decided to watch it again less than a year later in sub. It is consistently a joy to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nI love the characters and the dynamics between them. I love the music. I love the goofiness. I love the serious moments that ensue later in the series. I love the show. It was my personal gateway drug to the romance genre in anime and I can't recommend it enough if you're at all interested in high school romcom anime.\\n",

            "content": "***SPOILERS N SHIT***\r\nI'm routinely let down by poor endings. As a writer I know firsthand how difficult it is to conclude a story, particularly if you've become attached to all the characters. Do you want them to live happily ever after? Do you want to punish them for a character flaw? Do you want leave the audience guessing with an ambiguous ending so they can form their own mental picture? Or do you just fuck it all up because you clearly misjudged what drove your work in the first place.\r\nThat last one isn't a question because it's how Toradora!!!!!111! decided to do things. The writerstook generic characters, gave them enough personalities and quirks to keep even someone like me--who is not a fan of romcoms in the slightest--invested in the outcome, and weaved a clever up-and-down rollercoaster of emotions. The best part was that the ride transcended its high school setting and never seem tied to \"teenage years\" melodrama.\\n\\n\r\nWell, until the last few episodes. Running away from home? Eloping? Enabling friends? Conveniently-away roommates/family? Convenient loving grandparents? Convenient unconcerned friends/parents/school officials/thefuckingpolice? Well, I could deal with all that. I was even considering this a 9/10 despite all that stupid crap because of how invested I was. And then the final episode rolled around.\\n\\n\r\nI barely have the heart to talk about it. I could not be more frustrated. She expects him to just wait around while she selfishly runs away \"to deal with her own problems and become a stronger waman\" like a complete idiot? For various reasons I've seen more than my share of romcoms and this plot thread is repeated so often it's an actual cliche. And guess what? IT NEVER WORKS. It's ALWAYS stupid. It would have been better if the protagonist had broken his neck falling from the bridge, because at least that's interesting.\\n\\n\r\nOh, what could have been. Just like dating whores in high school instead of forging meaningful friendships, watching this anime was a mistake that I will regret. Mostly because of how good it should have been if the writers had been great instead of good.\\n\\n\r\nOn to the next disappointing anime.\\n\\n\r\nPS. I really liked all the characters here, so if you're into that sort of thing it's still worth a watch. But if you want a satisfying ending that flows with the rest of the series just give up before you start.",

            "content": "Having seen this anime five times now, I find myself wondering what it is about it that keeps me coming back to it over and over again. I would say at its core, it\u2019s the characters. The characters aren\u2019t particularly unique in design, and you could certainly break down the various character tropes and archetypes. But here the characters have such distinct personalities and are so fully realized, that by the end of it, you feel like you know these people. You care for them.  Take for instance Aisaka Taiga, the main female lead. On the surface she\u2019s your typical tsundre character archetype. She\u2019saggressive, pushy and rough around the edges. But unlike a lot of tsundre characters, she has a lot of depth to her. She carries a lot of emotional baggage, and is actually quite fragile. Because of this, her actions are often underlined by her emotional struggles. It gives her actions meaning.  Even someone that isn\u2019t a fan of tsundere type characters could emotionally connect to her and have empathy for why she is the way that she is. Or at the very least, there is an understanding to the actions rather than her just doing things to fulfill an archetype. Her personality is actually backed up by the things that shaped it. And that, in a nut shell is why this show is so special. You could look at Toradora! as a rom/com slice of life show on the surface, but it really has a lot more going on underneath everything. \\n\\n\r\nOutside of the characters, the show really does a great job balancing humor, romance and drama. Every episode is enjoyable on a basic entertainment level. But just as I described the characters having more to them then you would expect, so do most of the episodes. Often an episode has an underlying message or emotional story to tell. And the show just oozes with charm. I can\u2019t emphasize enough at how likable the characters are, and how enjoyable most of the situations in the show are presented. As a result it\u2019s a slice of life show where even the mundane actions are both enjoyable, but often feel like they have some kind of deeper weight to them. That\u2019s an extremely tricky thing to pull off. But it\u2019s because the characters are fleshed out, that these scenarios often feel like they are either building towards something greater, or is a deeper reflection of something that the character feels deep down inside. Because of this, even episodes that don\u2019t have drama or a big moment to push the plot forward, still feel rewarding.  \\n\\n\r\nThe romance in this show is complicated.  But it\u2019s because of this that I really appreciate it. Way too many romance stories are either I. the typical fairy tale romance where two people fall in love, and everything eventually falls into place. II. An extreme amount of drama and pain and suffering.  Toradora! Is a lot more subtle about a lot of these things. Don\u2019t get me wrong, the show can become really melodramatic at certain parts in the plot.  But it feels more realistic in that, the drama is built up to, and even when it unfolds, it\u2019s not straight forward in how it\u2019s dealt with.  Often romance is complex, especially at a young age. And while Toradora! Is far from being a realistic drama, it\u2019s actually one of the most realistic romance\u2019s I\u2019ve seen in anime, and it feels very raw and real.  The way characters deal with their emotions (or don\u2019t deal with them), is really what makes the romance feel like something special (vs. a typical hyper-realized romance).  But perhaps the reason the romance works so well, is because the show doesn\u2019t just view romance on a surface level (such as infatuation/attraction). While we get to know these characters as the show progresses, so too do the characters get to know each other.  And so, the romance feels more realized, as the relationships and the human connections start to shape their feelings.\\n\\n\r\nToradora! subverts your expectations, as it begins with a lot of the things that you would expect from a rom/com typical anime.  Taiga comes off as a typical tsundre.  Romance is portrayed by infatuation and surface level attraction. To be clear, those are actually very human traits.  Often when we fall in love with someone, it\u2019s an unrealistic and \u201cromantic\u201d kind of love.  It is infatuation and attraction.  And so those elements are fine. But often romance in shows are only left to that, and as a result when the actual romance happens, it doesn\u2019t feel as if the romance is based on anything beyond infatuation. Toradora! starts off this way, but as the show progresses you quickly realize that these characters are more then they seem, and the feelings they have change and grow as their relationships and experiences start to shape them. And ultimately, this is why Toradora! really is one of the best romance\u2019s in Anime. \\n\\n\r\nThis show isn\u2019t perfect (what show is). If I had any gripes, I would say that there are plot elements that could have been handled slightly better. It\u2019s not that the show didn\u2019t have enough time, so this isn\u2019t a case of where things were rushed. Rather, it was their choice on how they focused on certain things, that can kind of feel like a misstep. I won\u2019t go into details as I don\u2019t want to spoil anything substantial. But I\u2019ll just say this, everything that is intended in the show, makes sense logically if you step back and take it all in. However, their focus on certain elements might make a certain plot development feel kind of rushed for some. If you understand that feelings and emotions are supposed to be developing in the background (even when characters aren\u2019t necessarily showing it), then it makes more sense in the long run.  Conversely, I also had a problem with the ending with regards to this criticism of focus. Before I scare you off, the show wraps up in a fulfilling way. Some might be torn on the ending itself, but don\u2019t worry, you will be satisfied with everything prior to the last 20 min, and the ending itself doesn\u2019t change anything or move the plot away from the resolution.  But because the story is written in a way, where I personally feel it could have done a better job explaining what they were going for, it does come off as a little jarring and disappointing. But again, this is a case where if you step back and look at the bigger picture, the actions do make sense. Thematically it makes sense. And if anything, I think apart of the disappointment comes from the fact that you\u2019ve come to love these characters so much, you just don\u2019t want it to end. You want more. You\u2019ve seen the journey, and the resolution. Now you want to see them enjoy that resolution. THAT is where I feel some of the disappointment comes from.\\n\\n\r\nTo wrap this up, I really think this is a special show.  I think it\u2019s easy to look at this and not understand what all the hype about it is. On the surface, there isn\u2019t anything particularly unique or special about it. There isn\u2019t any insane action, drama, or world/conflict being set up. It\u2019s a slice of life/rom com.  But what makes it special is the characters, and how fleshed out they are, and how it handles these characters emotions and their journey as they grow.  Not only that, it\u2019s funny, romantic and charming as hell. This a show where you will be both entertained while also getting a little more than you bargained for.  And so, while I won\u2019t be so bold to proclaim this as being one of the technically best anime, it\u2019s really the overall package and how it all comes together, that really keeps me and many others coming back for more. \\n",

            "content": "This anime, when it had finished, had left me thinking and wondering. It had left me in a way where no other anime has made me felt before. It was a unique and different feeling than anything I've ever felt before. Whether it was to do with the dramatic yet subtle entrance, or the closing, last few moments that were intended to be light hearted but at the same time very \"deep.\" This anime had left me with a feeling like none other. The dramatic twist and the steady trend to lead to the final conclusion that had (to most people) left to leave theaudience awed at how for once this was not a story to go with the obvious route that most had expected. Most anime do not take the turn that Toradora had taken, and that is what had made this anime beautiful and wonderful. The simplicity of this show as well, as it puts together the dramatic romantic scenes along with the light hearted comedic moments. It starts and finishes in two different lights, and when you are finished you are left to believe that these two parts were completely different, in which they are. This anime had found a way to make both the playful moments and the dramatic moments entertaining and enjoyable. The slow build up of emotions that is being piled up, the feelings that are flowing through behind the scenes, the inevitable conclusion that the two characters face. It all had led to Toradora being one of the best animes I have ever witnessed. I had found, no disappointment in this show, it had only left me with joy to the very end. \\n\r\nP.S\\n\r\nIf you want a deeper reason as to why Toradora could possible be one of the best romantic animes so far, (after you have watched if of course), then watch this review. But please, watch it AFTER Toradora. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fEkFtmIRU0\\n\r\n*copy and paste onto URL link*",

            "content": "Why I liked this anime?\r\n1.  Amazing characterization. \r\nThe story has depth, with healthy and detailed character development.  With a cast of 5 mains which consists of 2 guys and 3 girls; with a flurry of recurring and supporting characters from parents, pets, to classmates and teachers---let's just say the load is massive.  However, to the success of the writers I felt they are handling the job well.  I will say some of the main characters were late bloomers however, through the progression of the story lines/arcs the writers were able to definitely reorganize and enrich them.  So where I initiallyfound them lackluster, the writers were successful in making them interesting to watch and get to know.   Added to that you can really connect with a lot of the characters. \\n\\n\r\n2.  Great story lines/arcs.\\n\r\nI definitely have to say there are arcs in the way the writers developed the story.  Because they have so many mains, to give them their dues there were arcs created to focus the specific main character and have the other characters respond to the actions, reactions, issues that arise.  So you're seeing the greater depth of all the characters as they are embroiled into the life events of one focused character.  You end up seeing the magnitude of emotion through anger, respect, laughter and tears each of these characters have with one another.  What's interesting is that this shows a depth that is transcended into the story.  So while some may not normally take a lot of animes seriously, this is one that gives you something to talk about.  The best statement I've heard in regards to the story is, \"pathos-invoking\" and I couldn't agree more.  The story and characters are definitely conversation makers.\\n\\n\r\n3. The plot.\\n\r\nBasically romance and friendship arising in a high school.  Relatively cliche with twists and turns: meaning?  The plot moves from what I consider the cliche to the complex fast.  There is what I find, and liked, that the romance is more like a confused emotion for deep gratitude. Lots of these kids, when you're seeing their personal life are angsty kids living in a lot of drama; but it's the angst that provides a lot of understanding into them and they seem rather normal teens to me.\\n\\n\r\nSome of the things that I found problematic.\\n\\n\r\n1.  Slow development.\\n\r\nWith some of the characters, I found them to be cardboard cut outs because they did nothing in the commencement but eventually did come into their own.  The problem with this is, is that it feels a little too sudden.  As though contrived.  It's very annoying to see the transition sometimes, because it seems the characters are a bit OOC. \\n\\n\r\n2.  Cliched teen angst.\\n\r\nOkay, I even summed this show up at times to Dawson's Creek without a creek and animed.  I remember, when I was in High School my favorite saying was that I was, \"Dawson without a creek and female.\"  It just felt liker continuous angst.  So a lot of the time if you're a teen angst watcher or experiencer, you might get a bit annoyed by this.  Everyone sort of having feelings for everyone, or so it would seem, and no one knowing what they're doing.  \\n\\n\r\n3.  Token characters.\\n\r\nActually this is the most annoying for me.  Because I definitely did feel [initially] that a lot of the characters were token (this feeling does change through time).  This is very different from the novel version of the characters.  However, I put that down to compression problems and the art.  Meaning that the producers/writers on the anime have to deal with taking several volumed/chaptered stories and making it all fit.  So what happens?  A bit of lost translation of the full feelings or meaning of feelings by the characters.  This is also affected by the problem with the art.\\n\r\nBut keep in mind this was later changed since the story develops more through specific arcs for each character bringing them out of token and into complex.  So the art and compression issue are small limits that are later broken through.\\n\\n\r\n4. The art.  \\n\r\nOverall the art was fine.  Yet, I find the problems in really understanding the full meaning of the character or just the character in general is because of expression. I can name several animes in which the art was breathtaking and you really get into the characters.  Yet, in this one, I find it could have been better.  I felt in a way it affected the characters negatively rather than positively because their expressions just were either not fitting or unnecessary or a weird to interpret.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall?\\n\r\nI'm loving it, meaning I loved it!  Definitely a nice story and I think with some of the faults I found a great deal more of pleasure because the pleasure was on a regular basis, the faults can be easily ignored or later changed.  I do think it's a fun, ecchi (not as ecchi as it could be), slice of life story broken in by major teen angst.  Good stuff and definitely a great watch.   I recommend reading the manga and novel",

            "content": "I really wanted to love Toradora! Honestly, I thought that it had all the ingredients of an anime that I would enjoy. Sadly, while the series started off good, it slowly faded into a mediocre show. \r\nThe story follows Taiga and Ryuuji as they try to help each other with dating and other aspects of life. Unfortunately, this continues throughout most of the anime, even when it's clear what the ending will be from the very first episode. I think this was part of the reason I was so disappointed by Toradora! It doesn't take a rocket scientist to know what will happen to Taigaand Ryuuji when the series finishes. The problem is that you don't get to seize that moment until much later on. A ton of the episodes feel like filler, especially a big chunk that deals with Taiga and a personal problem she's having, which is not ever resolved. This would've worked better as a series with 12 episodes instead of 25. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation used for Toradora! is pretty good, but nothing special. It's just one of those things that works for this type of show. I was never blown away by the animation. The character designs suffered a bit due to this. In particular, I was hoping Taiga would be a bit more polished. Perhaps that's not the right word. JC Staff usually deliver when it comes to female characters, which is why I really enjoyed Aria and Shana so much. Here, Taiga looks plain. There's nothing really special about her. Maybe that's what JC Staff were aiming for. I just wished she had more of a flare or special quality to her design. \\n\\n\r\nAs for sound, it was okay. The soundtrack used in the anime isn't memorable at all. The first OP used in the first half of the series was okay, at first, but I soon got very sick of it. The second OP, as well as the ED's played during the credits, were bad. \\n\\n\r\nI didn't really have a problem with Taiga. In fact, I quite liked her character It's Ryuuji that annoyed the hell out of me. As I said before, from the very first episode, you know exactly where things are going with each character. For the first half of the series, I had no real problems with Ryuuji. I just saw him as bland. Later on, I learned that he is not only bland, but also completely oblivious to to the world around him. Get ready to be pissed off during the second half of the series as Ryuuji becomes unaware about the wants and desires of other character around him. Sure, for some this might be fun to watch, but I was having none of it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I am quite disappointed by Toradora! I was hoping that since this was one of the highest rated productions by JC Staff that it would become one of my all time favorites. Sadly, due to the filler episodes, unsolved subplots, and Ryuuji, I can't say too many positive things about Toradora! It's a show that could've been truly amazing, but tried too hard to be an epic masterpiece.",

But an exhilarating experience that towards the end forces you to just sit back and enjoy the ride, with all the emotional ups and downs that accompany it. \r\nWhile not a unique concept, the story lends itself to exquisite execution, with a masterful telling of the hazardous, yet charming journey of two unlikely lovers. Even though no drastic measures are taken throughout the unraveling of the plot, by the end you feel a certain affinity to the entire cast which you can not claim felt for many other shows. And very little will leave you with the same warmth asToradora. You cannot help but don the same wry smile which Ryuuji and Taiga commonly share.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are an excellent mixture of quirks and shortcomings; and with a broad array as well. While Minori is warm and inviting (though odd), Ami is cold and standoffish. And then there's Inko-chan. But to focus on the two main characters is to shine every spotlight in the world on the most gleaming part of Toradora's composition. Ryuuji is fierce-looking, but the kindest, sweetest soul there could be. Taiga, on the other hand, looks like a fragile doll, yet is every bit as violent as Ryuuji looks. When the two come together, a satisfying clash is created, where a viewer can almost see the chemistry and the making of an everlasting love. An incredible warmth is felt in the viewers' hearts at every interaction between the mismatched duo.  A warmth that makes one hope for only their best, and a warmth you certainly don't want to let go.\\n\\n\r\nOn the AV front, the show manages to excel by rarely ever having outstanding QUALITY as is commonly seen these days. Whether or not Toradora was able to escape the budget shortfalls of other anime, or if its funds were more excellently appropriated remains to be seen. One thing is sure: Toradora is a visual and audial feast of which calibur will rarely be seen again.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, Toradora is a fantastic adventure through the complex rivalries of relationships, and a believable telling of the formation of a very true love. It's a show with feeling rarely felt in any sort of medium, and a show that no connoisseur of romantic anime should ever dare to miss.",

            "content": "Toradora is very good anime. It changes your life... for the better. In fact it's so good that if someone right now was about to tell me I was gonna die tomorrow, I would rewatch the whole series before leaving this beautiful Earth for my version of anime heaven. No matter what your background is, if you just don't get along well with your parents, if you didn't have the childhood you wanted or if you had or have love problems or if you just wanna smile at very funny situations and character dialogues... everyone can relate to the Toradora anime and characters in someway.\\n\\n\r\nToradora is a story about Taiga Aisaka and Ryuuji that eventually grows into love story. It's a story of world of emotions and feelings that change through time. There are many funny situations, those lovely awkward love moments, interesting and cute characters. Everything you want from this anime genre mix-up: Comedy, Romance, School, Slice of Life. I won't go into plot details as not to spoil for those who might watch the anime. Let me say oly that: when you start watching it, you just can't stop until you watched the last 25th episode. Hint: make sure you watch the last episode right to the end past the end credits or you might miss the crucial epilogue.\\n\\n\r\nTaiga Aisaka is 16-year old high-schooler. Due to her family situation and her history Taiga is very afraid of her own emotions. Because of her being teased by schoolmates (she is small and has small/no breasts for her age) and having some bad love experience she is also very insecure. She desperately wants to be loved and accepted by others. But feelings and emotions for her are hard to bear and she usually reacts with violence, even when liked by others. Taiga character is very good scripted and superbly voiced. It's no surprise her voice-actor Rie Kugimiya won Best Actress in the third seiyu awards for the role of Taiga Aisaka back in 2009. Taiga is a character that sticks to your mind, you cannot forget her. She levels the meaning of word Baka to new heights. So whenever you watch any anime, when some character says \"baka\", you instantly get smiles while thinking how Taiga would have said it. \"Baka Chihuaua\" or \"Baka inu\" .. and then you start laughing.\\n\\n\r\nRyuuji is Taiga's classmate. He's nice, polite, hard working. He always tries to help others, so is with Taiga with her one-sided love for some other person.\\n\r\nThus he becomes friend of tsundere Taiga and slowly helps her to transform into a quite nice girl. He is very patient even when Taiga unleashing kicks ad blows on him. Because of this traits, he is a target for 2 other girls (very interesting and funny characters), which makes Taiga jealous.\\n\\n\r\nWhy do you have to watch Toradora!  ?\\n\r\n- because if you don't, you're missing it out on something very special here.\\n\r\n- because it is highly likely to change your life...for the better of course\\n\r\n- because if you don't, Taiga would probably say to you that you \"honto\" are \"baka inu\" and she will kick you and punch you.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhat do you usually do when you're done  watching the Toradora series?\\n\r\nstep #1: you say to yourself... damn, that was awesome!\\n\r\nstep #2: after you realize there is no season 2 you get sad and angry...\\n\r\nstep #3: you are so pissed off, you're really thinking of packing your bags and heading for Tokio to herras the Toradora producers to make season 2...but \\n\\n\r\nthen you realize you don't have enough money for the trip...\\n\\n\r\nWhat can you do if you still don't have enough of Toradora?\\n\r\n-you should watch the Zero no Tsukaima series and Taiga look a like Louise Fran\u00e7oise Le Blanc. She also has some cool \"baka inu\" quotes that will make you laugh for a while...\\n\\n\\n\r\nYou \"honto\" should watch Toradora! you \"baka inu\"!!!\\n",

The plot is about a boy and a girl which in love with each other's best friend and that made them support each other and spent time like almost all day long. From what I saw, it's too obvious that the main characters are going to end up together, especially when Ryuuji and Taiga lives nextdoor and even almost like livin together. That's why I said it's too obvious they'll end up together, and when I saw a character has a crush on either Ryuuji or Taiga, this things always came to my mind \"it's impossible, you got no chance with your love\"\\n\\n\r\nArt: In this anime this part is really bad, especially Taiga, I was hoping she will be the cute character but it never happens. Taiga's fighting scene also really bad, or maybe it's just because I just finished action anime with an epic fighting scene.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I think the sound is not that bad if you really focus on the sound, but for me the music didn't impress me, maybe because I in clannad, just by hearing the themes I can remember the scene.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I didn't enjoy this anime, my only motivation to finish this is because I don't want to make a review if I haven't finish the show.",

            "content": "Toradora! ...where do I start? I just finished this anime and I'm still smiling. The story is just absolutely wonderful. The anime was so wonderful that I had to write a review for it right away while everything was fresh in my head. If you love anime that has great, unique characters, love-polygons, and comedy that will make even the saddest bunch laugh then you'll definitely love Toradora! At first, the title really didn't interest me. That's the first thing we all see from an anime and that is its TITLE! The next thing we see is the cover art. I saw the title andI thought \"toradora!\" ? doesn't really sound interesting. I read the genres and saw the cover art and I told myself that it didn't look half-bad. Boy... I was wrong about the anime, I started watching it and didn't stop till the next day. I skipped my dinner and sleep for this anime and i'll break it down for you guys right now.\\n\\n\r\n~STORY\\n\r\nJust let me start off by saying the story is unique and extremely cute. I would even say it rivals that of Clannad but in the end, Clannad still squeezed through by a bit but I'll leave that for another review. Toradora! will seem like the typical love story at first where a boy loves a girl and another girl loves the boy's best friend, so the two team up to help each other out. Yeah... it's pretty typical, but the creators did such a good job at leading the viewers to think this for a good 15 episodes until you suddenly start to see the change in the story... a change that was pretty unsuspecting to the viewer. The climax of the anime was not anti-climactic whatsoever, the creators did a wonderful job at keeping the viewers on the edge of the seat wanting more. The ending made my heart ache at first but then a sudden twist that relays a message from the beginning of the anime got my heart to skip a beat and just made me fall in love with the anime. The ending to Toradora! is one of the cutest endings ever; it would have been the cutest ending if had not been for Clannad to take first place there. Toradora! is the second anime to have ever made me laugh and cry and jump out of my seat in excitement. I gave the story a score of 9 because even though it was one of the sweetest stories I have ever heard, I still felt that Clannad is still ahead.\\n\r\n~TRUE SCORE: 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~ART\\n\r\nThe artwork was eye catching. The artwork definitely did it's job. When the scene called for a serene atmosphere, you got it. When it called for an eerie atmosphere, you got it. When it called for a cute and sweet scene, you definitely got it. The artwork covered all range of the spectrum even during moments where it called for extreme dramatization. The title of Toradora! didn't really catch me at first, it was the artwork that reeled me in and convinced me to watch it. I gave the art an 8 because it was definitely great, but there were some scenes when I thought that they could have done better. (i.e. the bird was a bit to... comedic)\\n\r\n~TRUE SCORE: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~SOUND\\n\r\nThe sounds of the anime were your typical anime sounds, some sounds I've even heard from other anime. There's really not much to say about it. I'll talk about the seiyuus in the characters.\\n\r\n~TRUE SCORE: 7/10\\n\\n\r\n~CHARACTER\\n\r\nThe characters were amazing. The development of each character definitely excelled among other anime. You learned about each of the main characters and majority of the supporting characters. The anime included a comedic relief in multiple forms but did not overdo the comedian. The two main characters would be Ryuuji and Taiga. The way they really made these characters are just... I really have no words to describe how much I loved those two. Despite Clannad receiving a higher score, the characters of Toradora! and Clannad are perfectly even here. They didn't leave out any characters nor did  they cut short on any characters. They definitely gave it some thoughts on their characters. They gave Taiga a personality you would call a tsundere but the way they tackled it felt like they didn't rush it nor push the personality on her. The way she changed was subtle and excellently executed. The seiyuus they chose for the characters really did match how I would imagine the characters to sound like. Especially that of Aisaka Taiga. The reason why I loved the seiyuus they chose is because not only does the music, the art style, and location sets the mood of the anime but it's really the voice actors and actresses that seals the mood and they couldn't have chosen anybody better for each character.\\n\r\n~TRUE SCORE: 10/10\\n\\n\r\n~ENJOYMENT\\n\r\nI was kept on the edge of my seat at all times. Even though I skipped my sleep and dinner, I neither felt tired nor hungry. I did not even yawn! The story was just too captivating and the comedy came at the right moments to really keep you glued to the screen.\\n\r\n~TRUE SCORE: 10/10\\n\\n\r\n~OVERALL\\n\r\nOverall, I would definitely recommend this to anybody that loves a good love story. If you've watched Clannad and loved that then I would definitely recommend Toradora! Toradora! is just one of those \"must see\" anime, in my opinion. It includes drama, romance, comedy, and even a bit of action in a few episodes. I gave it a 9 because yes, I enjoyed it and this anime made it to the top of my list but my number 1 spot still belongs to Clannad, just by a little.\\n\r\n~TRUE SCORE: 9.5/10",

            "content": "Toradora! at first seems like a cliche romance series. There's been so many, it seems, over the years; it would have to take one outrageously different (yet subtly very simple and not complex) story to grab a person's attention and keep the viewer wanting more. After all, it's been done hundreds of times, and 99.9% of the time they end up corny or just plain stupid. I'm happy to say that Toradora! is a fresh take on a romance story, but with a major twist: the main characters aren't your typical main characters, and their interactions go above and beyond what's usually expected.\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nThe storyis, of course, an outstanding 10 out of 10. I try not to give a perfect score unless something truly deserves it; but this time, I was genuinely (and very pleasantly) surprised. Toradora! definitely starts off a little awkward, and you may be tempted to just drop it as quickly as possible. However, I implore you to stay: the comedic moments and clumsiness at key times make the characters seem more and more like that one friend of yours that has (insert blank) personality. I was impressed at the honesty and stark portrayal of the characters; they bypassed my expectations, and continued to throughout the whole series. \\n\\n\r\nA little background that covers it in a little more detail: it so happens that Taiga Asaika has a crush in a guy named Yuusaka Kitamaru. It gets a little more complicated; Asaika's neighbor, Ryuuji Takasu, happens to like a girl named Kushieda Minori. What makes this so convoluted is that Kitamaru and Takasu are best friends, and Minori and Asaika are also best friends. So the natural thing to do would be to help each other out, right? Let's just say it gets interesting. Misunderstandings, awkward pauses, hilarious banter, and countless other little things happen; and through it all, you snuggle a little closer to each character, as they develop and progress. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOh, how can we forget the art? I try not to give art a 10/10 often; but here, something amazing happened; we got faces. We got the \"I'M SO MAD I'M GONNA PUNCH YOU\" face, the \"THIS IS SO EMBARRASSING\" all the way to \"THE WORLD IS DEPRESSED, AND SO IS MY FACE.\" Good gosh, I've only seen facial expressions drawn in such human pathos only few times before. This sold me; from the first episode, it caught my attention and held it. The environment was drawn nicely, yes, so were the various objects or classrooms or homes. But you're not paying attention to such trivial detail when you can gaze upon these perfect, gorgeous facial expressions. I seriously became transfixed halfway through the episode. If you were to mute the volume and not understand a word of Japanese and not read the subtitles, you could probably still understand exactly what's going on. The arm movements and body posture were secondary; but this, THIS is something else! \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSo the 'sound' category encompasses not just the ED and OP, but the character's voice acting, sound effects, and background music. The OP I memorized instantly; catchy and bouncy, it was the epitome of the show. I always listened to the whole thing, simply because of the way it caught my attention so quickly. The ED was similarly tasteful, however a little dull since the mood of the OP and ED matched so nicely. I wanted something different to wrap up the anime rather than identical songs. The character's voice acting was astounding. Accurate and polished, I almost forgot I was watching anything; I became a character within, watching with my own eyes. The voices and characterization seemed so surreal and positively charming to listen to, I swear it was close to hypnosis at times. The sound effects were your typical stuff; things dropping, tables scraping, feet walking. The background music was almost non-existant; that disheartened me at times, but that also made the mood seem more stark in contrast to the events going on, so a little absent background music wasn't bad. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nToradora! would've fallen flat on it's face without the cast of amazing characters. Just because Aisaka and Tukasu fit into that typical role doesn't mean the other characters did. Aisaka is and always will be a tsundere that everyone loves; a stereotypical one at that, conscious of her small stature and conflicting emotions. She continued to amaze me throughout the anime; her character arc was a roller-coaster of emotions and non-linear personality quirks; she changed as often as a guitar solo; never quite the same, but always going off on tangents. Takasu was your main protagonist, and the story was told mostly from his point of view; not that I didn't mind that. A neat-freak and woman-like about his household chores, he really symbolized a perfect house-wife(husband?) sort of person, yet was indecisive all the same. Kitamaru is brilliant, but lacks common sense sometimes. However, he knows more than he reveals, and continued to surprise me throughout the series, dolling out hidden information here and there that revealed his true self. Kushieda Minorin was probably the most interesting character of them all: she appeared the perfect air-head, incapable of knowing what's going on in the world around her. She almost pulls if off perfectly - except she reveals her true self a few times, notably to Takasu. Instead of an oblivious girl with no direction, she actually had inner theories and thoughts, and described certain feelings of hers with complicated metaphors; but that's what made her interesting. Ami, a character later introduced, seemed sort of a bridge for the other characters, providing a mental link, if you will, between Takasu and the rest of the gang. She's like that rickety bridge over a roaring river; sometimes, it seems like a good idea to trust her; other times, she seems as fickle as Asaika.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed Toradora! with all my tiger-like heart. What little flaws there were just simply faded or disappeared; there were too many good qualities that the bad seemed as insignificant as an ant. To put it bluntly, I loved this. I started off with a simple recommendation from a friend; but everything he recommended turned into a tear-jerker or epic action sequences; this turned out to be the latter. Instead of trudging to the next episode, tired and dejected from the previous one, I hurriedly and hungrily watched them as quickly as possible, because every detail was precious. After all, a dragon and a tiger can only do so much together...",

            "content": "OVERRATED. \r\nWhenever someone asks me if I have watched Toradora! That is the first thing I will say to that person. The story is overrated, the characters are dull and the ending is ridiculous.\r\nNow I have your attention, the plot. The plot is a pretty average boy likes girl, girl like other boy, ends happy but not really type of boring story you will see in American rom-com movies that is so predictable you can see in coming 2 episodes in. The story is set around a male protagonist called Ryuji Takasu who is apparently considered a delinquent because of his eyes and because ofthis feels he will never get a girlfriend. We discover he has been put in the same class as his best friend Yusaku Kitamura and a girl he has a crush on, Minori Kushieda. When he is at school he happens to meet the Taiga-chan, a short girl with a short temper which is why she is likened to a tiger and the two create a dysfunctional 'friendship' relationship based around on their crushes.\\n\\n\r\nMy friend and I reminisce about this anime from time to time and the initial reaction is how did we watch 25 episodes of this? It was terribly boring with a cast of people who were pretty uninteresting too and a lot of pointless episodes that just seemed like the studio had some left over money so put in a lot of filler.\\n\r\nThe characters, I think, are the main thing wrong with this anime. We have Taiga, a short girl who seems to be ostracised for being short and quick to get angry which I have never seen in anime before ever. We also have Ryuji, a lead male character who is also ostracised for because people think he is a \u2018delinquent\u2019 because he has \u2018delinquent eyes\u2019 which seems like a really superficial thing for someone to base opinions of him to me but it is what it is. Then the other two, Minori and Kitamura, who seem to change their minds, attitudes and actions every ten minutes to benefit the main storyline. The interaction between the main characters seems really forced, with Ryuji taking a lot of grief  from Taiga and has to cook and clean for her because she knows he has a crush on a girl. I don\u2019t know why he takes it for something that seems pretty trivial from where I am looking but there we go. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending to this anime is just ridiculous. I vowed to have no spoilers in my reviews so I can\u2019t say what the ending is but take my word for it, ridiculous.\\n\\n\r\nI must say the start of this anime for me did offer some hope that I found something that would be good to watch but this hope was quickly taken away by the poor story I was being sucked in to. I also must say the dub and sub work on this anime was a good quality as was the art but it was quite easy to overlook these points with Toradora!\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, if you are looking for a first-class romance/comedy anime, run very far away from Toradora!\\n",

I felt like I was enlightened when I heard this because during the day, when I'm surrounded by people, I try to understand each and everyone of them because I believe that everything has a reason behind it but  often times when I'm all by myself I don't get why I do/say/feel certain things. \\n\r\nOverall, the message that Tora dora gives is that no matter how hard things might be, in the end true love is the one that wins and every single effort counts! \\n",

            "content": "Having seen many romance and slice of life anime, I have to say that Toradora is one of the best out there. It is predictable at times, but it's different from many of the traditional romance anime out there. Of course, we all know how the anime is going to end, but the journey to the ending is unique.\r\nThe story follows these two main characters as they try to find love. The girl is a tsundere, who has trouble expressing her emotions and often uses violence because of it, while the guy is a very nice and servant-like person, who everyone mistakes as a delinquentbecause of his looks.\\n\\n\r\nWith the first few episode, the anime focuses on the two characters' interactions with one another. We see how they meet, how they became somewhat like friends before it starts to focus on other characters and developing the plot. I found Taiga to be annoying the first few episodes due to the fact that she was whining half the time, but as the show continued, she became a more likeable character and she ended up as my favourite.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nPlot 9/10 - It was a simple enough plot, but it was also interesting. In each episode, there was something going on and it progressed in a good pace. It wasn't too fast and it wasn't too slow.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 8/10 - The development of the characters was well done as we see them transform as the show continued. We saw the development of Taiga and Takasu, mainly, but also the side characters as well. The show did a really good job on focusing on everybody, but not drawing away from the main plot line.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10 - The animation did a good job of highlighting the character's personalities. It showed the different sides of Taiga, the kindness of Takasu, and a lot more that made this anime enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 5/5 - After watching Toradora, I have to say this might be my favourite slice of life anime as of yet. There were some flaws, but the pros outweighed the cons at the end and it was very fun to watch. I'd recommend this show to anyone who likes comedy and slice of life genres.\u00a0",

            "content": "Looking for a cute and un-cliched romance-comedy anime? One which has realistic main characters and good character development, along with a good amount of screen time for the supporting cast? Then go and watch or read something else. You will NOT like this anime if you have such expectations from this anime.\r\nStory 1/10\r\nI hope no one starts calling my anime taste \"shit\" because I gave the story of this anime a 1 outta 10. It totally deserved it, though! I mean, the synopsis of Toradora on MAL doesn't match with the show itself at all. \r\nSo it's like, Taiga has a crush on Ryuuji's bestfriend. Ryuuji has a crush on Taiga's best friend. Both of them befriend each other so that they can help each other to start dating their crushes. It seems to be as if the intentions of the people who made this anime was to make it seem interesting by adding such a theme to the anime.. and well, they failed.\\n\r\nToradora Synonym: Tiger x Dragon\\n\r\n..Taiga = Tiger and Ryuuji = Dragon\\n\r\nYeah.. totally not cliched. I mean, the name of this anime literally SHIPS the two main characters, and that is so disappointing! It already slaps away the character development for these two characters. I mean, they already start acting like boyfriend and girlfriend from the first three-ish to ten-ish episodes. Why is that? Because they both spend A LOT of time with each other, Taiga goes to eat dinner at Ryuuji's every night, etc etc and I'm sure everybody who has watched till here should have realised that they're already gonna be the couple of this show. I don't know why but most people use this as an excuse 'they just didn't realise their love for each other yet!' but no, that doesn't differ from the fact that it's a bit too obvious and stupid. \\n\r\nAnd remember when I said that they both became friends so that they can help each other to date with their crushes? The whole concept get's ignored HALF WAY THROUGH THE STORY which is insane. Exactly the reason why I said that the synopsis of the anime makes no sense. The ending of this anime was just so bad! Ryuuji and Taiga are cowards when it comes to love. I think I gave my reasons for such a rating. 1/10\\n\\n\r\nArt 6/10\\n\\n\r\nSo the art isn't bad or anything.. I actually liked the art style a lot. It's just that the animation is dreadful. It's okay if no character is running or anything though, otherwise it's goddamn horrible. That's it though, nothing much to say other than this.\\n\\n\r\nSound 6/10\\n\\n\r\nI liked the openings and endings of this anime, they were nice, especially the 1st opening (it was very catchy). The one thing that I really dislike about this is that none of the OSTs, or anything was memorable. Not that important, not exactly enjoyable so yeah..\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 4/10\\n\\n\r\nNow, we need to talk about this. I don't mind if characters are mean or selfish, heartless or anything, it's just that.. they could have at least one thing which is likeable about them (could be evil or good) right? If they don't, it's boring. Mediocre. Bland. And anything else negative mixed up.\\n\r\nThere are many good characters in this anime, but that doesn't mean that this anime doesn't have any bad characters, or should I say.. a lot of bad characters. Let's take Taiga as an example; she's mean. She's rude, harsh, plaiiinnnn stupid and annoying. She is SO, SO, SO ANNOYING. I mean calling her a 'tsundere' itself is an understatement. Also, she's not cute at all. She's just a 17-year old undeveloped 4'8\" brat. She also beats Ryuuji up for no good reason, she's too impatient, and there was no reason for Ryuuji to have fallen for her. I'm done with her. She's so bad, and I hate her so much I can't even express it. She's 85% as to why I hate Toradora, because Taiga gets the most screen time out of all characters. Yeah and no character development. But that must have been pretty obvious after what I told you in the story section. Now there's Ryuuji. I liked him a lot, but then I realised that he's almost like the complete opposite of Taiga. Patient, hardworking, kind etc.. I don't know why that just came to me after completing the show. Later on I felt like he was being manipulated (in a way) by Taiga and getting weaker and more 'controlled to change' during the whole show. As you can see the two main characters of this show are just.. a -3 or -4. The only characters that I liked were Minorin and Ami because they were pretty interesting, and they got at least some character development. I started to concentrate on them more than the others after I was starting to get bored of the show (around.. 12 episodes in). There was also Kitamura, who I don't know, he was really boring to me. I don't even know what his main role was in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is one of the worst romcoms I've ever seen. It was so disappointing. I found it a lot easier to realise the flaws of this show than it's pros. So yeah, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, thanks for reading my review!\\n",

            "content": "This was my first rom-com anime and, though I've tried to find one that might top it, I haven't had any luck. \r\nStory 9/10: The premise itself is already different from the typical rom-com premise, and it stays that way as it goes on, so much so that, even though it's a slice-of-life without incredible plot-twists, you never get bored and it never feels predictable. The only reason I decided to dock a point off this section was because of the ending, which wasn't horrible but it could've been better.\r\nArt 10/10: The character designs take a bit of getting used to, and the art ingeneral is pretty average, but there are times when it looks absolutely incredible, and during such moments you can definitely see just how much work they put into it. Apart from those moments, I really love the backgrounds, which might not seem remarkable compared to other anime, but they work really well here.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10: I'd be tempted to dock a point because I don't really like a lot of the background music on its own, but the few tracks I do like more than make up for it, especially when coupled with the voice acting, which is generally solid, and sometimes mind-blowing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10: Honestly, I only love the two main characters. I've seen this anime three times so far and I still haven't really gotten attached to the three very prominent side-characters. They are definitely fleshed out and very good characters overall, but I personally just don't like them very much, especially Ami, who I might call mature if she wasn't so annoying most of the time. However, Taiga and Ryuuji both make up for that. They're definitely some of the best character I've ever seen in anime, both individually and together. Their unique dynamic is definitely the leading factor behind my love for this anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10: The first time I watched it I fell in love with it in the first few minutes, and I marathoned it in two days, not knowing how empty I would feel when I finished it. I've seen it two more times since then, and it still manages to make laugh and cry at the appropriate moments. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10: If there were more rom-coms like this, I'd definitely be a huge fan of the genre. As that's not the case, this would be my first recommendation to anyone looking for a good romance anime.",

In 25 episodes, there were only about 5 episodes worth of plot, and a whole lot of nothing dragging out the rest of the show for some reason. It should have been 12 episodes max.

            "content": "This is my first review so it may not be so good XD.\r\nAt first glance, Toradora may seem like any normal romance comedy anime. However, it has a combination of slice of life genre, romance and drama, not to mention its unique character personalities. \r\nStory: 9\r\nThe story starts off with impact, making you want to know more about the characters and how their relationships would develop. Once the story picks up pace, almost all the episode would have that slight cliffhanger and drama feeling at the ending and would make you go \"just one more episode\" until it ends. Also, the change between slice oflife and drama throughout the series is gradual and through many different scenes, unlike most rom com animes. I personally like how the story slowly builds up its drama, switches to romantic scenes, its sudden twist at the ending but  happy and complete ending. Most people think the ending was not clear or complete but after going over it a few times, I found it to be a hint for a nice sweet ending. I would like it more if there was an OVA featuring the characters' lives afterwards though. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThis anime has  relatively good graphics and character design. They have a unique style to their characters' eyes and hair,  especially that \"messy\" effect done on Taiga's hair.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nLove the OPs and EDs. I also loved how the EDs overlap with some of the dramatic ending of the episode, kind of making you overwhelm with emotions during the last few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\\n\r\n-Takasu Ryuuji\\n\r\nMain character. Very unique character. Scary looks but gentle personality type. \\n\\n\r\n-Aisaka Taiga\\n\r\nDefinitely lives up to her tsundere loli queen title. One of the best tsundere girls XD\\n\\n\r\n-Kitamura Yuusaku\\n\r\nI don't have much to say about him XD\\n\\n\r\n-Kushieda Minori\\n\r\nShe helps make this anime livelier and adds to the slice of life with her cheerful and unique personality.\\n\\n\r\n-Kawashima Ami\\n\r\nI'm still quite unsure about her thoughts and feelings but she isn't that much of a bitch as the story progresses. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nOne of the best love story there is.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:9 \\n\r\nThis series is one of the best anime I've seen and I definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a romance comedy or romance drama. This series is also quite realistic and the perfect choice for anyone new to non-action anime or anime in general.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "(2nd review :D I'll try to keep it short)\r\n\"If you trip while running down a hallway you will get a nosebleed. If you trip in life, you'll cry.\"\r\n-Minorin Kushieda\r\n~Toradora!\r\nYou have that average romantic comedy mixed with high school slice of life. \"Boy meets girl, girl meets boy.\"\r\nSo far nothing that interesting, then, why is it an 9? Not a 7 or less? In my opinion, it differs in plenty of ways from the average romantic comedy and I'll try to explain why.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nI'd compare its story to potato chips *--* \r\nIt's kind of addictive.\r\nYou eat the first one, it's good, then you get another, andanother, and another, when you realize you ate it all and sometimes wants even more. That's the feeling this show gave me.\\n\r\nIt all starts with silly romance, turning into bittersweet love and ending with a little bit of drama. J.C.Staff managed to adapt the light novel into 25 episodes without leaving anything behind.\\n\r\nThe plot is mainly about Ryuji and Taiga trying to find how they really feel and, what they want for their lifes. You get funny, embarassing and even more serious moments during the show.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nIt is not that awesome, you won't get those eye catching \"landscape visuals\" like the ones you see in \"5cent.persecond\" or \"Clannad\" neither the details like in \"K-ON\". Basically the main scenario is the school and its surroundings.\\n\r\nHowever, they focus into the characters drawing, giving them really convincing looks and expressions, something that is really important in these kind of romance/drama series. All the scenes were carefully animated.\\n\r\nI also enjoyed the colors and the animation they made for the 2nd OP/ED \"Silky Heart\" and \"Orange\". It matched with the tone of the music perfectly. \\n\\n\r\nOST/OP/ED: 10/10\\n\r\n(...)\\n\r\nDamn violins ~_~'\\n\r\n\"Lost my Pieces\" ->  remember the name of this song because you'll never forget it. It may be one of the most touching I've ever listened to. The OST for this serie was so well done that even if the situation wasn't that touching, by hearing this song (along with \"Yuugure no Yakusoku\" and \"Yasashisa no Ashioto\") you'd get really depressed.\\n\r\nAbout the OP and ED, 'Pre-parade' was good for introducing the characters and all but I found 'Vanilla Salt' weird. In compensation I really liked 'Silky Heart' and 'Orange' since it followed the pace of the story. If you take a closer look, you can notice that the song summarize the events of the last episodes and show how the characters' relationships are progressing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\r\nUnique ones.\\n\r\nIt's interesting because you have the characters that every high school classroom have with their own problems, but somehow they get to know each other better, and build up a friendship despite their differences. The (aparently) antisocial guy with scary looks, the hardworking class representant, the (weird) captain of the girls' softbal team, the (chibi) tsundere and (of course) the popular and beautiful transferred student (who's also a model). Mix them all and you have a interesting group.\\n\r\nCharacter development was also well done. You can notice that the OP change to 'Silky Heart' (that's much more serious) just when things gets less carefree and more tense between the characters. After ep. 18 you have more drama than comedy comparing to the first episodes. And you start to get the feeling that things are leading to an end.\\n\r\nI wish Ami would get more screen time... (I won't spoil here) but there was a lot more to show of her. She was put aside in the final episodes, like Kitamura (the difference is that his arc had already ended...)\\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nI bought the premium edition when it came out, and just finished rewatching it for the 3rd time. After all this time I can say: it's still exciting. Like I read in another review, it's a cute show. Relaxing to watch and heartwarming. It have its sad moments, but everything work out well in the end.\\n\r\nI consider it a must of the romantic comedies. Especially if you watched something like Clannad or Air that left that feeling of sadness/melancholy, Toradora! will cheer you up again.\\n\r\nHappy endings ftw! :3\\n\\n\r\nIt was longer than I expected... Hope it was helpful!",

            "content": "Toradora! Review:\r\nSimplicity. Sometimes keeping things simple really makes a show something special, and that's exactly what Toradora! provides.\r\nStory 8/10:\r\nLike I said, Toradora is a very simple show. Being so simple, the story really isn't anything groundbreaking or unique. However, this doesn't by any means mean that it is bad. Toradora is about two students named Ryuuji and Taiga. The two each have feelings for the other's best friends. Ryuuji and Taiga spend the majority of the show trying to help each other get closer to their respective crushes. The show is primarily composed of episodes of various events that open up opportunities for Ryuuji orTaiga to get closer to their crush. These are very fun episodes to watch, and although episodes like these in other shows tend to lack direction, every episode in Toradora has purpose in establishing the characters and directing the show towards the closing episodes. Toradora doesn't do many unique things with it's story, but what it does dish out are well executed episodes that only strengthen the simple story that it has.\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10:\\n\r\nThe art in this show was very good. The characters all felt unique from each other from an artistic standpoint, and the varied locations were all well animated. It's hard to describe, but the art in this show just felt unique. It is much like the show in general, where there really isn't anything crazy different about it, but it somehow stands out in the crowd.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10:\\n\r\nMusic wise, the sound aspect of Toradora was great. The OPs weren't my favorite at first, but quickly grew on me. The EDs are very catchy and some of my favorites. The background music fits the tone of the show well and does nothing but help set the mood of each scene. The voice acting also did nothing to disappoint. I loved Taiga's voice acting, and although I'm no expert in the world of japanese voice acting, I must say that I really liked the characters' voices as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10:\\n\r\nThe reason this show shines so much is probably because of the two main characters. Ryuuji is a teenage boy who, due to his eyes, is interpreted as a mean intimidating guy. However, he is really just a kind person who likes to cook and clean ironically. Taiga is a very short teenage girl who looks cute but is actually vicious and will not hesitate to insult or even attack somebody she dislikes. The dynamic and growth that these two characters have together is truly something special and kept the show interesting at all times. The side characters on the other hand can be much weaker. The side characters for the most part lack depth and can seem extremely one dimensional or just plain poorly written in a couple cases. Minori was the exception as she actually had different sides of her on display throughout the show. All in all, the dynamic between Ryuuji and Taiga is what really helps this department shine even though the supporting cast is unimpressive.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10:\\n\r\nNo question I loved watching this show. It's hard to put my finger on it, but something about this show had me hooked. It was a pretty laid back high school romance with comedy sprinkled around. Most shows like this tend to lack focus and feel like a huge set of filler episodes with no particular direction. But unlike the norm, Toradora stayed focused to it's plot and continuously moved forward instead of dilly dallying with pointless episodes. The show gets you to connect with the main characters and you can really feel the emotions that they feel, whether it be happiness, confusion, or sorrow.\\n\\n\r\nRecommendation:\\n\r\nIf you are into the romance/school life genre then definitely watch this show. It really is something unique and you should at least stream it.\\n\r\nStream it! +.1\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7.9/10:\\n\r\nI know many of you will think that since I gave this a 7.9 that I should round up. But I really don't feel that it would do shows that really did get an 8 or higher justice. It would also bring up the question of whether or not I should round up shows with ratings like a 7.5 or 7.6. In my mind something like that would be outrageous because for me a 7.5 is miles away from an 8. Anyways, Toradora is a truly special anime. Its simplicity and ability to stay focused through a lighthearted story are truly impressive. The characters are very easy to relate to and there really aren't many real \"flaws\" to the show. The show is a perfect example of maximizing potential in a pretty average plot concept.\\n\\n\r\nThe Verdict:\\n\r\nSimple, yet special. Toradora is a one of a kind anime that is very hard to dislike.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+Characters are easy to relate to\\n\r\n+Doesn't get off focus\\n\r\n+Can be very touching\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Unimpressive side characters\\n\r\n-Safe plot concept \\n\\n\r\nIf you liked Toradora! watch...\\n\r\nGolden Time:\\n\r\nWritten by the same manga author and both have a definitely similar feel. Romance, initial love triangle, drama, and comedy.\\n\r\nAnohana - The Flower We Saw that Day:\\n\r\nLove triangles, drama, feels, and tears. Enough said.\\n\\n\r\n7.9/10 - Very Good",

            "content": "Romantic Comedy is always an uncertain genre for ambitious anime. Generally speaking, \"romcoms\" are enjoyed because of their absurdity and good-natured humor while somehow managing to touch on the thinest strand of deep emotion within the romantic framework of things. It's ironically frightening, really, when Toradora! provokes more than enough honest thought and sweet sentiment underneath the camouflage of supposedly whimsical comedy.\r\n-Story- \r\nOutstandingly intricate, the drama is suffused with originality and ironic wit, and it can be said that it is the story that makes Toradora! shine. While the obvious romcom tropes, such as Locked in a Room, Love Letter Lunacy, and the dreaded DramaBomb, are conventional, the permeating sense of disorientation and counterproduction remains pleasantly expressive. Comedy is relative to the viewers' tastes, but the shifts in pace are glaringly charming. Due to the romantic and comedic nature of the anime, predictability is relatively improbable. There is no awkward deus ex machina luxury so many other romcom anime fall back upon when the chronicling gets tough, and so Toradora! ensures a very special type of realism within the nature of comedy. The romantic element, in one of its rarest (and dare I say finest) forms, is hence born out of a carefully crafted maelstrom of natural sentiment.\\n\\n\r\n-Art-\\n\r\nWhile there is nothing particularly facinating or prodigious about the artwork by itself, the appropriate expression of detail in respect to the context is satisfying. The general details and animation for characters and backgrounds are consistent, but nothing exceptional. However, the various angles within scenes hold appropriate value, and contribute well to the respective mien. The chromatic arrangement of characters seem to also provide minor aesthetic enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\n-Sound-\\n\r\nThe anime has a reasonable degree of auditory satisfaction. Voice actors were sufficient, if not suitable, for their roles, and particular OST, such as Lost My Pieces, provide applicable emotional triggers for the contextual atmosphere. The shift in OP/ED songs halfway within the anime invites the critical mood change smoothly. \\n\\n\r\n-Character-\\n\r\nToradora! holds a character cast of interestingly complex personalities. Character development for the main two protagonists, Takasu Ryuji and Aisaka\\n\r\nTaiga, progresses at a versatile level of depth. Character interaction initially shows convenient stereotypes, such as the Misunderstood Loner, classical Tsundere, and Genki Girl: further development systematically dismantles a large component of the stereotypes, revealing distinctive rationale. The character cast is memorable, and it is probable that some degree of sympathy, if not empathy, can be concluded from the audience.\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment-\\n\r\nI cannot claim that Toradora! is the best anime out there for everyone, even if enclosed within the genre of Romantic Comedy - but it is personally meaningful and freshly expressive to me. It is one of the few anime out there that, as poorly as it sounds, \"gets what love is\", applicable to romance (and I know many can/do/will disagree). It is an anime that isn't afraid to express another form of love in stark contrast to what is styled as the ideal true love only found in dreams and fantasies.\\n\\n\r\nLove becomes something of a confusing, vast, overwhelming, and wondrous phenomenon - and I think that is why I enjoy Toradora!",

            "content": "Following is a review on Toradora. \r\nSo, Toradora is arguably the most popular SoL Highschool Anime out there and for God knows whatever reasons. Alright for starters this show isn't even good. And it's so Goddamn overrated it makes my head hurt. \r\nThe art is pretty meh and generic. Yeah yeah the Anime is a decade old but that's no excuse since Haruhi Suzumiya had a much better art despite being a 2006 Anime. \r\nNow onto the characters\r\nAisaka Taiga: OK, now from where do I begin. For starters she IS NOT a good character. She is the living breathing example of why the \"Tsundere\" typeis cancer. \\n\r\nHer character is so bad yet people act like she is some sort of Goddess. Her obsessions with that bland ass Kitamura was so cringe worthy to watch that it hurts. Her aggressive behavior was uncalled for for the most part but that is EXACTLY the reason the creatures who are even lower than degenerates love her. She was over-dramtic as hell. And her character BARELY developed till the end but the part of the reason would be that it was so bad to begin with that you couldn't do anything about it. \\n\\n\r\nRyuuji: Ah the typical and generic dense af Main protagonist with little to no self-respect in him. A girl constantly insults him yet he is all about \"Taiga this, Taiga that\". Bullshit. \\n\\n\r\nKuushieda: First of all her original Japanese voice is such a cringe it makes Asta's VA sound like Miyano Mamoru. Her character was all about \"I am Taiga's best friend and I'll even go and strangle some babies for her sorry sake\". Barely a likable character. \\n\\n\r\nKitamura: Just watched the episode where this DUMB F*ck dyed his hair. That's all. It's enough for anyone to judge this dumbass. But for some reason girls are attracted towards him.\\n\\n\r\nKawashima Ami: Ah the only good part about the show. A character which actually developed and had a brain and was not only emotions. If it wasn't for her then I wouldn't be able to finish this hot garbage. I will nevr forgive the author for making her a love bird for a dumbass like Ryuuji who TILL THE END didn't even realize her feelings. \\n\\n\r\nOk now the story. \\n\\n\r\nTypical Highschool story with over-dramatic situations. Now don't even think of giving me that \"They're only Highschool students\" bullshit because I went to school too and never once I was this dramatic and nor were my classmates were but hey at least the Over-dramatic moments in Toradora weren't nearly as Bad as in \"Oregairu\" (I'll write a review on that overhyped show too sometime later). Taiga is in love with Kitamura since she herself rejected him once. Her reaction whenever Kitamura arrives was not one bit cute. Ryuuji is your typical Main guy having problem interacting with people and everyone is scared of him because of his looks but still somehow have the most famous and most pretty looking girl in the class fall for him but that dumb F*ck still choose a flat, 4 cm short loli who is head over heels for another guy. But hey that's not all he is also in love with Kuushieda but somehow is afraid to show his feelings and that thing dragged out until it was revealed that Kuushieda also have feelings for Ryuuji but won't admit it instead sacrificed it for Taiga who is obviously head over heels for Kitamura but somehow have developed feelings for Ryuuji too (what a hoe). Mehhh. Also I would also like to mention the student council president. First of all she has no manners. She doesn't even know how to talk. Giving every student insulting remarks and every degenerate just laughed at it. If I were in those students I would probably start a protest against that sort of a President. Taiga kicking her butt was the only time I ever liked Taiga. Also about the ending. Honestly I liked it. BUT somehow the fanbase consist of brainless sheeps complained about that. Idiots, can't you all see that this was the only time when Taiga's character showed any development. She finally realized everything and returned to her mother. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all this Anime is barley enjoyable and overrated as hell. I feel like people like this show just for the sake of bragging about it only. Definitely one of my least favourite Anime of all times. The official Neon Genesis Evangelion of Highschool SoL genre.\\n\\n\r\nI don't get the hype for this trash bag at fucking all \\n\\n",

I had been spoiled the important part (I won't say it since I don't want to spoil it) but that didn't stop me. I wanted to see if it was as good as people said it was and boy were they right. The characters were the best and were so likable. The story for me was spoiled but I thought itwas pretty good and I liked it (even if I knew what was going to happen). The music was quite memorable and gave me the feels. I enjoyed this wonderful anime. It made me smile. It made me laugh. But most of all it gave me the feels. I felt like I was going to die from the feels. It truly showed the side of me I never showed. If you like romance anime that has a tsundere, lovable characters, and feels I'd recommend this show for you.",

            "content": "This review contains spoiler\r\nSo Toradora was pretty good. Now I dont watch a lot of romantic comedy anime anyway and this genre is pretty hard to nail but this show does it suprisingly well. I cant remember the last time I enjoyed watching a rom-com as much as I did with Toradora. Why is that? well lets get started:\r\nPlot: Toradora uses similar kinds of storytelling which isnt new, in fact its kinda cliche, but is still entertaining due to the execution being very good. \r\nThe show likes to use quite a few arcs which dont feel completely disjointed and help to grow and further alongthe actual story which is of two polar opposites slowly finding a connection and it is developed very smoothly. \\n\r\nOf course since its set in a high school you can assume you will have your typical beach arc/episodes or the cultural festival arc/episodes which happen in EVERY SINGLE HIGH SCHOOL ANIME IVE EVER SEEN thus far but its still executed good for the most part. \\n\r\nThere were some nitpicks like at the end of episode 21, I thought it felt unnatural and felt like writers had written it quickly, if you have seen that scene then you will know what I mean (Taigas fall).\\n\\n\r\nIf you have seen my anime list tags of Toradora then will have seen that I thought one arc was kinda forced. That one is Kitamuras arc. \\n\\n\r\nIts not bad but it kinda comes out of nowhere and Kitamura completely changes in a space of 10mins and all of a sudden hes depressed and he loves the student council president and im like \"Where did this come from\"? but never the less it doesnt drag the show down its just a problem I had.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Toradora takes, again, somewhat cliche character archetypes of the genre but manages to make them likeable and hell even memorable.\\n\\n\r\nTheres Ryuuji who is your typical nice guy protagonist but hes got layers, hes reserved, hes nice but not too nice hes very much relatable, he has low self esteem about it himself but hes still funny and likeable and unlike other rom-com heroes he is NOT a total dick, he acts very much how someone would in this situation.\\n\\n\r\nExample in episode 23 Ryuuji realises he kinda likes Taiga a bit more than he thought and handles the situation with the girl he was originally going for but instead of going, derpdy derp I dont know what to do, he handles it maturally and respectfully which I liked about him. Ryuuji is a pretty good guy and I liked him a lot.\\n\\n\r\nNow onto Taiga our female lead, now I usually dont like tsunderes and its hard to talk about her because thats exactly what she is and thats how she starts off but in time she grows and becomes more understandable as to why she is so brutal and bad tempered which I wont spoil. Shes also the greatest drive of entertainment and I thought she was hilarious. Her realationship with Ryuuji is likeable, well developed and natural and funny.\\n\\n\r\nKitamura is likeable, nice, of course he does open up to in that forced arc but im glad the writers gave a shit to give him an arc and grow his character.\\n\\n\r\nMinorin is actually my favourite of them all. She goes from generic, boring nice girl to quite interesting and I wanted to know more about her. i.e. in episode 3 its implied that she just puts on her cliche personality as a way to cover her deeper emotional problems and I wanted to know what they were and it kept me watching. That and her clapping scene made me really like her and made me want to really get into her personality and why she is like that.\\n\\n\r\nLast one ill mention is Ami, now she starts off again as a cliche character but as the show goes on she, again, opens up and her mindset is interesting and different. Her rivalry with Taiga goes from cliche to quite funny and enjoyable. I liked her interactions with Ryuuji. I always looked forward to seeing her in episodes and im glad she was there.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Animation is pretty good. Character designs are good enough that I remembered them months after watching the show. I did notice once that some characters looked off model but thats just a one off. i.e. amis neck looked too thin at one point. But it is pretty consistent.\\n\\n\r\nSound: the 1st opening is great. So catchy and awesome and how I cried when they changed it. WWHWHYYYY!!!!!!! the 2nd op is ok, taigas smile in the 2nd op always kills me. The rest of the soundtrack is pretty good and accompanies scenes very well in particular the final episode, the background music fit very nicely with what was going on and felt haunting but beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Toradora is very enjoyable, its suprisingly funny and I ended up actually caring and liking the characters and plot.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Toradora is a pretty good show to watch even if you dont like rom-coms like me this one is well done. Of course I had problems with the story choices and characters saying things due to circumstances that kinda come out of nowhere, see episode 21,\\n\r\n(im trying to avoid spoilers so sorry if I dont make sense, message me if you wanna know what my problem with episode 21 is) I think Toradora is worth seeing and you probably should see it and I hope you enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\nDo message me with feedback because I could always use some, you dont have too but still.. Thank you for reading.",

            "content": "I don't usually watch romantic anime. I started anime for the fight scenes and still spend most of my time on fighting-focused anime like One Piece and Naruto. \r\nBut as invigorating as those are, they can't beat well-made, 2-cour anime like Toradora!, which are more compact and are more dense plot-wise per episode, if you know what I mean. One episode of a 1- or 2-cour anime is much more fulfilling than the average 1 episode of a long shonen, which typically requires 5+ episodes for minimum satisfaction. I watched the first 10 episodes of Toradora! sporadically, returned to episode 11, and stayed up allnight watching the rest. This is the kind of romance story whose ending you can easily predict. This is a story with many romantic conflicts, whether triangles or one-sided or what have you. Toradora! is extremely well-written, with superb dialogue between the main characters as they go through their high school romantic struggles together. What happens is just... perfect. It's sad and uplifting at the same time. The protagonist, Ryuuji, reminds me of Tomoya Okazaki from Clannad. Both spend a lot of their time helping a girl with her problems, both have icky family situations, both are such noble characters. I admire Ryuuji a lot. Even though you can predict the ending, it's still sweet to watch. It's so bittersweet and touching. Love is truly a wily character. Many people make mistakes when pursuing others for love. Watch Toradora!, and learn from it. It says a very wise thing about finding your true love.",

            "content": "Short review: If you like romance watch it now.\r\nLong review: This is the 2nd best romance anime I've ever seen (my first being clannad after story). I honestly would probably recommend this over clannad though and let me explain why. Unlike clannad Toradora is only 25 episodes and it is quicker and easier to get in to for probably most people. Now on to my real review for this anime. First of all the story. At first I thought this was going to be your everyday romance anime story but it became so much more than that. There is plenty of moments that will makeyou smile and laugh, but then there is the moments that will make you lay down and cry in to your pillow. Also unlike most romance anime I've seen the ending is sooo satisfying. On to the art. I don't have too much to say about the art. It is a very nice anime to look at. It isn't the best art I have ever since even though it has its moments of brilliance. The art isn't very good that is all have to say about it. Now the characters. The two main characters (Ryuji and Taiga) are very memorable. Especially Taiga. Taiga is a tsundere but not a annoying one like some of them. She is one of my favorite girl characters in anime just take my word for it that she is awesome. I very much enjoyed this anime. It felt amazing to sit and watch this whole anime in a weekend. If you enjoy romance this is a must.",

I actually really appreciated they way it was funny, that being with almost zero cringe, which is pretty hard to see these days (in american series and the few anime i've seen so far). It was fun to watch and I wouldn't have realized thatI'd watched 12 episodes in a row if I hadn't gotten hungry. Story is pretty good and original, no meet-and-fall-in-love here. Watching the characters and the relationships between them evolve is the best part. The quality is about the same in all the episodes without the plot repeating itself. Not really anything especially bad or good about the animation; the music is okay I guess, the thing I liked about it was the 1st opening because it felt like a great match for the whole thing.\\n\r\nTbh, loved this anime and 10/10 would watch again, seriously thought about rating it with 10 but I just can't really call it a masterpiece, probably because it's not my favorite genre.\\n\r\nA lil' tip about the last episode, don't miss the actual ending that starts after the credits roll out, it's really worth it!",

This roller coaster, with its twists and turns, really made me feel that life and love is not all its cracked up to be. Maybe it was the fear of heights, or the unimaginable speed, either way, I WAS moved.\r\nStory(10): I did not want to simply dish out 10's, but Toradora! is with ought a doubt, a ten. Toradora! is the epitome of all rom-coms, it is the great anime that inspired many others. The story is a very original and heart warming feel, you will have trouble everfinding an anime with a plot comparable to Toradora. If there is one anime that could even dare challenge Toradora in the love department, it would be Clannad. Toradora is one of the few animes that will physically render you speechless. It is one of the largest rides in the anime theme park. \\n\\n\r\nArt(9): Great details on characters and flawless scenery. \\n\\n\r\nSound(10): In most anime I find myself just skipping the beginning and end credits, but not with Toradora!. The music was so perfect for the feel of the show, honestly a 10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters(10): Two words, character development. Toradora! handles characters in one of the best ways I have ever seen. It is not biased with its opinions of each character, and does not fail to show details that will be used later on in the story. I honestly will not say anymore, I may begin to spoil the enjoyment of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(10): I honestly took my time watching Toradora!, I can compare it to the wait on the roller coaster, you slowly go up, and up, then suddenly, it all comes crashing down. This is how your emotions will be played with, you will learn to like each character, and you will learn to feel the strong emotions that come with each one of them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall(9): The roller coaster has stopped, your seatbelt is unfastened and you slowly step out of the cart. As you step off, you look behind you and think to yourself \"What a ride that was, will I ever experience something so great in my life again?\" But sadly, the line to go again is extremely long, and you decide to come back another day. This line is the amount of time it will take for Japan to come out with another God-Tier anime. However long the line is, you know in the back of your head after watching what is Toradora!, that patience is a virtue, and if you wait long enough, dreams will come true. \\n\\n\r\nThanks, if you have any questions please comment on my profile. This is a biased review, because it includes my opinions, do not take it as a viable source for information.",

            "content": "Have you ever experienced an anime so much fun that you just can\u2019t stop? This was basically my experience with Toradora . At first when I heard about it, Toradora seemed unappealing and a regular school comedy, but due to its high popularity, I decided to give it a try. I watched the first five episodes, and put it on hold because I didn\u2019t want to get into lots of new anime at the time, but about a week after the last episode was released, I decided to get back into it, and before I knew it, I was about to enter the realm ofaddiction.\\n\\n\r\nToradora starts off with the male lead, Ryuji Takasu, who is trying to make his best effort to make himself look good for his second term of high school. Despite his caring, gentle personality, his eyes resemble as of a dragon, which is why a lot of people are afraid of him and why Ryuji is called a delinquent throughout the whole school. Ryuji then starts off his first day, happy to know his best friend, Yusaku Kitamura, and the girl Ryuji has a crush, Minori Kushieda, are in the same class as him, But soon enough, Ryuji accidentally bumps into the most dangerous girl in school \u201cThe Palmtop Tiger\u201d, Taiga Aisaka. Taiga usually has a negative attitude towards others, so after meeting Ryuji her first impression of Ryuji is that she really doesn\u2019t like him. It also turns out that they end up being in the same class as well. Later that day after Ryuji is called up to the front of the school, he finds Taiga holding onto his school bag.  He then fights for it, and endsd up getting his bag. Later at night, Ryuji figures out that the bag belongs to Yusaku, and that Taiga slipped a love leter in his bag. Taiga ends up in Ryuji\u2019s apartment to \u201ckill\u201d Ryuji after him finding out about the love letter. She was able to barge in because it so turns out she lives in the rich apartment next to Ryuji\u2019s apartment. Ryuji is able to convince Taiga to not hurt him by saying that he likes Minori. Oh, and did I ever mention Taiga and Minori are best friends? So basically they team up so they can end up with each other\u2019s best friend. Another character that is important to the story shows up around the fifth episode, Ami Kawashima, a model that is Yusaku\u2019s childhood friend. Ami has a liking to Ryuji, and hatred towards Taiga, so basically Toradora is a love pentagon. Pretty weird, huh? Toradora stats off sounding plain, but in later episodes it brings more uniqueness to the story, having episodes involve, Taiga VS Ami in a 50 meter relay, Taiga\u2019s family difficulties, Christmas, and a tragic field trip in my opinion that was unforgettable. Toradora has a really strong story, and the relationships between everybody are very strong, basically all of them close friends. \\n\\n\r\nOnto the OST and VA\u2019s. The opening, which you\u2019ve hard at the beginning of this review, is really spunky and has a Lucky Star quality to it. The second opening is very nice as well. Unfortunately, I can\u2019t say for the ending themes, because they don\u2019t give me the music quality I necessarily want. The soundtrack fits the mood throughout the series, and can be pretty calming at times. And the VA\u2019s do an especially good job portraying each character, especially Rie Kugimiya, who has played such roles as Alphonse from Fullmetal Alchemist, Kagura from Gintama, Mizore Shirayuki from Rosario Vampire, and Shana as Shakugan no Shana. Throughout these aspects, you can tell she did a spot-on Taiga.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in my opinion is absolutely flawless. Maybe it\u2019s because I watched the episodes in high quality, but it was shining and the colors were simply beautiful. The artwork shines throughout the series. I think this is probably one of Toradora\u2019s high points.\\n\\n\r\nNow the characters. The characters in Toradora are basically a hit-or-miss. There are characters in Toradora that are praised throughout the anime community, like Taiga, but some characters are neglected throughout the anime community, like Minori. I liked the characters, but for each character there was something missing between each one. Yusaku really got annoying after the last 10 episodes, Ami was a whiny bitch throughout the series in my opinion, and what really annoyed me is that characters that are basically extras throughout Toradora get rolled as \u201cimportant characters\u201d. But even so, I do believe that three of the main protagonists, Minori, Taiga, and Ryuji, are really good characters. Minori is very thoughtful of everyone around her, and is always putting her friends before herself. Ryuji is also thoughtful of everyone making their lives enjoyable, such as Taiga and his mother Yasuko. Taiga is perhaps the best tsundere I\u2019ve witnessed throughout the anime community. She can be stubborn to people, but when she gets to know them more as friends, she can be very kind and thoughtful towards them, and, well, beating the crap out of people when they get in her way is pretty cool, too. So the characters have strong points and weak points towards them.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall, Toradora was a fun experience. Do you want to know how much I enjoyed it? 11 episodes in a row without stopping, making a new record for me. Toradora has a great plot, great character design, great music and VA\u2019s, a nice set of characters, and a nice feeling after each episode. Toradora is a great experience that I think anyone could enjoy, so I recommend it to you, and my final rating is a 9.5 out of 10.",

            "content": "Toradora! is, in my opinion, a pretty solid stab at the Shonen-Highschool-Comedy-Romance genre that breaks the mold enough to be more interesting than other entries. However, due mostly to my personal tastes, a pretty lackluster ending and what felt like a rushed final few episodes; it fails to stand out as a great overall anime, and rather just a rather good Shonen-Highschool-Comedy-Romance. But let me break it down:\r\n~STORY~\r\nI have a big issue with the story, one that took me until around episode 16 to really forgive - that is that it should never have started at all. I don't count anything that happens in thefirst 2 episodes to be spoilers, but others may differ so... SPOILERS I guess - Here is my issue: When a violent bitch of a girl breaks into your house and attempts to severely injure you and causes property damage because that was her first response rather than \"Hey, I put something in your bag that I wasn't supposed to, can I have it back please?\" YOU DO NOT BEFRIEND AND ULTIMATELY LOOK AFTER THAT PERSON. You should call the police instead. And look, I get it, it's a thing of the genre that Toradora! is in; that people don't react normally to crazy violence. But it caused me to stop being engaged with the anime!\\n\r\nBut moving on - The rest of the story actually handles quite nicely, there are very few episodes that I'd consider 'wasted', rather each episode is used to reach the final goal (Unlike Nisekoi, amiright?) which is something to be admired in the genre. It helps that, save for our main protagonist, the cast aren't as dumb as a sack of bricks, which means the story can move about unhindered by needless stupidity.\\n\r\nHowever, even a great journey can be soiled by a lackluster destination, and this is where Toradora! stumbled over the finish line. First non-spoilers: To sum it up, pretty much the big emotional scene feels like it happens too suddenly (though to its credit, the show handles it well), then when the story seems like it may pay off to a satisfying conclusion, a hideous trope rears its head to create fake drama - but then almost completely undoes itself in the span of an episode with little rhyme or reason.\\n\r\n**SPOILERSPOILERS - Of course I'm referring to Taiga suddenly disappearing. It is hardly telegraphed, it serves no purpose except to serve up some kindergarten-style moral message (painstakingly given, mind you), it supposed to make you feel 'WHERE DID SHE GO, I WANT HER BACK' sentiment, but it invoked a \"well that was stupid and a let down\" sentiment (in me) instead. Not to mention that she appears, quite literally out of nowhere, at the very end, which desperately begs the question - WHY THE RADIO SILENCE IF YOU WERE JUST GOING TO SHOW UP ANYWAY!? Is it just to stupidly reenact a scene from at the start of the anime? What is the point? END SPOILERS**\\n\r\nAnd really, that is what bugged me about the ending - \"what is the point\", I would've been happy if it finished midway through the previous episode. ugh.\\n\\n\r\n~ART~\\n\r\nI watched the bluray of Toradora! and there were some weird visual issues. I mean, no animation is perfect (unless it's done by ufotable anyway), but irregular proportioning and facial features being out of whack seemed to happen a fair bit more than other anime I watch. Other than that, it's just pretty standard, I guess.\\n\\n\r\n~SOUND~\\n\r\nWith the exception of one or two bits of OST, I didn't really notice or care about the Toradora soundtrack. Just more standard affair.\\n\\n\r\n~CHARACTERS~\\n\r\nThe story section made this review a bit long, so I'll try and be fast:\\n\r\nRyuuji - Our main protagonist is as standard as they come. He can cook and clean, he's \"nice\" and he's thick as mud. He also has blue hair. His specialist perk is his 'scary' face. Really nothing else to say, so I won't.\\n\r\nTaiga - Ugh. I hate Tsunderes with no concept of self-control. It's such a tired cliche. Though, once she starts to stops being an annoyance, she actually starts to build character and become interesting. However one of her later 'developments' seems to happen way to quickly, though is still kept relatively quiet until the audience has already guessed it a thousand times over. Still, I haven't seen a pain-in-the-ass tsundere turn out so well in a long while.\\n\r\nMinori - Now we get to the good stuff. I actually quite enjoyed Minori, the... uh... dammit, if I talk about why she's a good character, it's spoilers! That being said, her bizarre 6th sense-type capabilities did make me roll my eyes a bit too frequently.\\n\r\nAmi - Apart from the whole \"protagonist made me a better person\" moment early when she is introduced, I felt like Ami was the most realistic character of the main cast. The way she interacted with the rest of the characters was actually pretty refreshing.\\n\r\nYuusaku - I like him, he's great. He's quirky and silly; but also a serious-but-smiling character. There's a whole undertone of knowing more than he lets on, but doesn't try to directly interfere. I was really disappointed when he faded out near the end.\\n\r\nThe rest - I like the teacher, she's a good laugh. The other side characters are... one dimensional, but not too disappointing. \\n\\n\r\n~ENJOYMENT~\\n\r\nAll in all, I did enjoy Toradora! more than I had expected I would. I finished it over the course of a couple of days, and even had a couple of instances of \"just one more episode, I swear\", which is always a point in the anime's favour. However, what I found to be a disappointing ending, and my annoyance with the beginning, colours my view of the whole show probably a little bit more negatively that it probably deserves.\\n\\n\r\n~OVERALL~\\n\r\nAlthough it certainly wasn't a genre I particularly enjoy, and one that is rife with cliches, I did enjoy Toradora! and found it to be a stand-out in its field. I guess it wasn't frequently recommended to me without reason. Hopefully what bugged me doesn't bug you, and you may enjoy it more that I did!\\n\\n\r\nToodles~",

            "content": "I wasn't attracted to the show at the beginning like many others, but this show ends up really stirring up the memories of my own and making me feel quite related to the characters. \r\nI haven't cried for a show for a long time. Before this it was \"Honey and Clover II\" and \"Wolf Children\" that sincerely moved me.\r\nMy overall rating for the show is 8.5, somewhere between very good and great.\r\n[Characters]\r\nI'm not a super fan of any of the characters, but the anime did an excellent job making me like each one of them. The character development is pretty impressive. \r\nFor example, I didn'tlike Ami when she first appeared. She was really a double-dealing arrogant badass girl who took advantage of her pretty face to fool the people around her and couldn't face her true self. But later she became very considerate as well as savvy, knowing how to comfort people around her when the time is right. \\n\\n\r\nMinori seemed to be a simple optimistic girl at first glance, but she actually thinks deep and sincerely cares about her best friend Taiga. In fact, the jolly girl certainly has her breakdown too, especially when she loses her favorite people, but she eventually still faces the bitterness of life with her cheerfulness. \\n\\n\r\nKitamura, as Taiga said, is really kind. He likes Taiga and was there for her when she needs help. But he fell in love with another girl, Kanou. It was surely a shock when he finds out that girl's gonna leave the country and study abroad. He lost himself once for that, but the people who loved him brought him back. \\n\\n\r\nThe series really making almost everyone has a relatively full character. Many supporting characters left a deep impression on me as well, like Ya-chan and the class-teacher Yuri. Ya-chan raised up Ryuuji all by herself after the guy left her for another woman when she was pregnant. It broke my heart to see her telling that Ryuuji that his dad died in an accident and that she will protect him so it would be fine. Yuri isn't just another single class teacher who knows nothing but complains about being single. When the class was complaining about the change of location for their travel, Yuri wrote on the blackboard that \"Not everything in life goes smoothly!\" to shut them up. It was an interesting and effective move. Indeed, \"Not everything in life goes smoothly!\" That's how the stories of every character show. That's what makes the show a more realistic story. And That's what makes me feel connected. \\n\\n\r\nBack to the main characters, Taiga and Ryuuji. \\n\\n\r\nTaiga had a hard time to feel abandoned by her parents in her luxury apartment, had a hard time to see someone she loved to love someone else, had a hard time to try to let go of someone she love to someone he likes a lot, and had a hard time to face her true feelings too. She gave me the first impression of being violently defensive, but I later find her to be quite sensitive. Other tsundere features like blushing too much when facing the boy she loves probably are just part of fan services, which I do not wish to comment on.\\n\\n\r\nThe show doesn't have as much to depict how Ryuuji feels; it's more about what he does. It keeps me wondering what he thinks about Taiga and Minori. If Minori hadn't kept rejecting him from the beginning, would he keep thinking Taiga as a sister, and would it end differently? But I guess love has a lot to do with timing after all. \\n\\n\r\n[Story]\\n\\n\r\nI've already talked a lot about the story when I talked about the characters: it helps develop the characters well and has a realistic touch. But I'd also like to add its downside. Although the development is good for a 25 episode show, but I don't think it's a perfect story. It has the cliche part and unrealistic part too. \\n\\n\r\nMany have complained it's almost evident from the beginning that Taiga and Ryuuji would be together. True. That they'd like to get married seems too sudden. It was balanced off by Taiga's leave without ruining a good ending by bringing Taiga back at finale, but it's still pretty unexpected in a not-so-good way to hear Ryuuji say that he wants to marry Taiga not long after he decides to switch his love interest from Minori to Taiga. \\n\\n\r\nThe confession of love from Kitamura to Taiga at the very beginning feels like a duh. The reason of that is very lighthearted: there's a pretty girl in the class, and he wants to begin the high school life by finding a girlfriend. Really?\\n\\n\r\nAmi in the first few episodes after her debut follows some pretty girl stereotype too much, although that impression was largely wiped out later.\\n\\n\r\n[Sound]\\n\\n\r\nMusic works well. There's a soundtrack called \"Lost my pieces\" that was used often in emotional scenes. It contributes a lot to those scenes, but it's not something impressive if you hadn't watched the show and listened to it as a stand-alone. I like it a lot though.\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]\\n\\n\r\nI start to take the show seriously after hearing Minori's talk about horror and ghost, and implicitly about love. I'm really moved and feel deeply related at episode 16, since it's similar to my own experience in many ways and it feels so real. After that, it was a wonderful experience to see the characters I mentioned before, Taiga, Ami, Minori, Kitamura, Ya-chan...to see them going through what they go through. \\n\\n\r\n\"When I try to laugh, my heart hurts a little. When the night ends, I think maybe everything will be alright.\"\\n\\n",

            "content": "Toradora starts out looking like any other anime. Misunderstood mean-faced guy, makes friends with what looks like a Tsundere character. I was a little apprehensive, having started this after finishing Lovely Complex-a tough act to follow. By episode 4 I was hooked.\r\nStory : 8/10 While maybe not going along the most original of plot lines, two characters helping each other out to get the guy/girl of their dreams, eventually falling for each other, the way the story spans out is unbelievably original and quirky. It starts out strong and ends strong, but the middle for me was the golden period. I have never seen ananime which so skilfully draws out the characters, slowly and carefully, like a bud blooming into a flower.\\n\\n\r\nArt : 9/10 To be honest, I find it rare in an anime to be brilliantly drawn, all the time. Even my all-time favourite Kare Kano has faults. In Toradora I found characters, surroundings, colours and clothing to be drawn at a excellent style, consistently. The quality never dropped or changed, and rather than being faced with what looks like entirely new characters in certain scenes because of the way they are drawn, you are left with a comfortable, familiar, and brilliantly well drawn anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound : 6 (?)/10 To be honest, I only pay attention to the soundtrack if it is very, very, VERY good. And this one, while suited to the anime, has me only remember the first opening song (trust me, when you hear it yourself, you'll understand) and a piano piece that had some discords in it. I doubt you will watch this for the soundtrack though.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 10/10 This is where I could find absolutely no fault. While Taiga starts out as your average tsundere character, she becomes so much more as you learn her past and all her little quirks (I dare you NOT to cry in the Christmas episode when she runs outside to find Ryuuji). Ryuuji himself is a selfless, honest and almost naive character perfect for a male lead (his acts of kindness towards Taiga will make you wish for a guy like him).\\n\r\nAnother thing I adored about this anime, which lent itself to me easing out my Lovely Complex addiction, was the characters weren't just 'filler' characters. They each had a purpose and role to fill, even if it was only comic relief (Haruka and the homeroom teacher - I forget her name). Kushieda, Taiga's best friend and love of Ryuuji, is a highly eccentric but utterly stuck in 'friends first, herself second', more motivated than anyone I've ever seen to do well for herself, will make you laugh and make you cry. Kitamura's appearances are excellently timed for he seems to come along just as Taiga's doting on him, but he has his own reasons for excelling at school...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 10/10 I dare you NOT to enjoy this anime, so well thought out I've rewatched it many times just to laugh at certain episodes. The ending will leave you satisfied but is not contrived in the 'and they all lived happily ever after' type of way. I laughed (mostly the kind when you have to stuff your face into a pillow to stop yourself from waking anyone up) and I cried (the type when you need a bundle of tissues at the ready) throughout this anime, all of which I avidly devoured in a matter of days (to the aggrivation of my parents.)",

            "content": "Toradora is probably one of the best school life, romantic comedy, drama that even those who are not a fan of the genre would enjoy.\r\nStory:7\r\nToradora is about a boy named Ryuuji who looks like a delinquint, but is actually very nuturing and kind, and a girl named Taiga who looks like cute, but is actually violent and what. They both have feelings for the other's best friend and thus the story begins. \r\nThe concept sounds generic, but the humor along with the way the writers portrayed the story, and character's made it entertaining enough that re-watching it several times fans still enjoy it.\r\nArt:7\r\nThe art isstrange, but at the same time portrays character's correctly. Ryuuji's eye's which are his most delinquent looking feature are at time's some what creepy, kinda Higurashi like allowing the show to easily express why people mistake his personality along with allowing viewers to easily pick up on character's emotions.\\n\\n\r\nSound:9\\n\r\nToradora doesn't only have catchy opening's, and good voice actors (Queen of Tsundere!) The ost is also enjoyable. Probably the only ost I go back and listen to that doesn't have some kind of lyrics. The BGM manages to portray character's emotions whether they are having heated discussion, or having a serious depressing talk.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:10\\n\r\nToradora's main character's are all based on a single concept; people misunderstanding them. Since most people are misunderstood they become extremely relatable. I'm sure everyone has been judged incorrectly atleast once. Each character is complex and developed all thoughout the story giving all of them their own draw in unlike other shows where they give a character an ark then drop them off the face of the earth, or their actually not that bad and become friends with the protaginist.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:9\\n\r\nToradora is one of the few shows that made me shed man tears. (I can count on a single hand how many have done that.) This show will make you laugh, cry, freak out, and all of the above. Even if you don't like the genre, think it's to long, or whatever reason you have. Forget about it and watch it!",

            "content": "Story: Yeah it is cliched, but many other anime settings are as well. The reason why I ranked it an 8 is that the way ToraDora plays with the story.\r\nArt: Nothing extraordinary but the exaggerated facial expressions and actions really bring ToraDora to life.\r\nSound: Love the opening and the ending. It's pretty different from what I'm usually hearing but it has a tune and lyrics that really catch on. If I were to compare it to another opening that has the same attractiveness it would be Lucky Star. Yeah I said Lucky Star, may the angry mob read on before tearing me apart.\r\nCharacter: This iswhere I laughed my hardest. The cast of characters are a good mix that work well together. They are all heavily exaggerated along with their actions, but that's what pulls this anime to the top for me. Really, can you say no to Taiga's face when she's about to cry? Or perhaps the totally strange parrot bird thing Inko who makes you bust out laughing despite it's small screen time? Minori was also pretty epic in episode 5.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: An anime that can balance the cute with the comedy this well makes it a ten for me. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: I probably should have given a 9 but the energy that the characters give off just makes me jump to a 10.\\n\\n\r\nToraDora is a must see for this season's anime.

Another... masterpiece?\r\nWhen I first saw the first episode of \u201cToradora!\u201d, it seemed to be repellent. I didn\u2019t understand the tone of it: a frightfully looking boy everyone is afraid of, possibly a son of some Yakuza member, lives with his unstable bimbo mother and a disabled parrot. One day, due to a misunderstanding, he meets a very short but aggressive and dangerous girl with an unusual name, Taiga who, into the bargain, brings a sword to school. She comes to his house in order to attackhim. Having seen this, I dropped this show with a smile on my face. Few months later I gave it another shot, I tried watching it again and... I was ready for one of the best rides of my life! What an emotional roller-coaster it was!\\n\r\nThe whole show is nothing like the first episode, so don\u2019t fall for it: it\u2019s a perfect slice of life mixed with high school romance. On the face of it, nihil novi sub sole, as they say. What really matters are the reasons why main characters act in different ways. Takasu Ryuuji struggles with stereotypes about his look and his difficult family situation (he has been raised by a single mother without ever knowing his father). Aisaka Taiga, the ultimate epitome of a tsundere, feels rejected and abandoned by her own rich yet dysfunctional family, left alone in a soulless habitation. She\u2019s kind-hearted but very truculent, thus she has trouble with making friends, not to mention romantic relationships. Taiga and Ryuuji live very close to each other so, one day, imperceptibly, they start to live in Takasu\u2019s flat, cooking meals, feeding a parrot et caetera. They\u2019re in love with different friends of theirs (Ryuuji loves Minori, Taiga loves Kitamura), so they make a pact: they will help each other seduce his/her love interest.\\n\r\nAlthough Kitamura (perfect and forgiving) and Minori (poetic and athletic) are side characters, they can be considered protagonists. There is also Ami Kawashima, a narcissistic and confrontational himedere. What makes \u201cToradora!\u201d a very interesting case study, is how they all try to help one another in a selfless, almost altruistic way instead of taking care of themselves. One can write a 100-pages long essay about their behavior, emotions and feelings: this is how chaotic and rich \u201cToradora!\u201d can be when it comes to the dynamics of possible relationships.\\n\r\n\u201cToradora!\u201d brings a vast and enjoyable character palette. There are multiple troubled adolescents to identify and sympathize with. They are all realistic, vivid and helpful. They love, feel, hurt, make fun, fight and grieve. This particular anime can be frustrating as hell if you cheer one selected character, but, altogether, it is really pleasant to watch. \u201cToradora!\u201d, that is already a 9-year-old anime, offers one of the greatest and most recognizable love stories in the anime history. Or maybe few love stories? Was it really love? You will certainly redefine some concepts of interpersonal relations after finishing \"Toradora!\". And yes, you will cry many times.",

            "content": "Toradora is one of the first animes I really watched. \r\n   Being very honest, I wouldn't call it outstanding, amazing or revolutionary. It's a great anime. It makes you smile, makes you feel things, and inside the genre it belongs to, it avoids a lot of mistakes you usually expect. (You know, those annoying tsundere vices, nonsense decisions in the name of love and etc etc etc.) \r\n   Also, Taiga and Ryuuji are such captivating characters! They're different (in a certain way), and their relationship trough the history it's something almost innocent? Very innocent, actually. It's all aboutfeeling comfortable around each other, respecting decisions, paying attention and taking care. You tend to see more smiles from both sides and less blushy-girls-stammering while the boy watchs them from above.\\n\r\n    The things is, if you enjoy the shoujo kind of entertainment but also like very human relationships/storytelling, the anime will be great for you. Maybe you'll cry a little bit just like I did. Have a great time <3",

            "content": "Toradora is a fun, heartwarming, and generally delightful show that manages to gradually bring in emotional complexity into an otherwise simple show. If I were to simply summarize what happens in the show it could easily be written off as an average romantic comedy, so I will point out a few things that the show does well.\r\nThere is a nice attention to detail which brings the world to life and also helps reinforce characters personalities in different ways. This can be through use of minor animation differences in how the characters walk that is very noticeable in the opening but also through scenes like onewhere Taiga throws a trashcan at Ami and after Taiga and Ami leave together later in the scene a clip is added of Ryuuji picking the trashcan back up and putting it where it was. Not only does this sort of thing reinforce Ryuuji's tidy personality but's it's simply something that would happen if a trash can where thrown like that so it's nice to see a traditional gag like that treated realistically. Similarly when Taiga fights the student council president in an exaggerated anime style, they still have Taiga end up suspended for 2 weeks which would be an expected repercussion of a fight like that that is often not addressed.\\n\\n\r\nAnother element that really made Toradora enjoyable was that it had a gradual change from being lighthearted and silly to becoming much more emotionally complex and serious. This is due to the characters in the show learning more about each other which leads to you as a viewer starting to see more complexity as character motivations and personalities become clear. The life events that the characters have to deal with like family issues, the impending graduation of high school, and the impending need to confront and resolve the feelings of romance that have developed in the cast that is continuously pushed off also fuels this growth in complexity. Time not being treated like an infinite resource in this show forces the characters to stop putting off issues they don't want to address and leads to very satisfying confrontations.\\n\\n\r\nThe last thing I will note is that each of the 5 primary characters in Toradora serves an important role and adds an interesting perspective to all of the situations. Ryuuji is probably the most functionally mature in his ability to handle all house hold chores while also managing to be a good student in school, yet at the same time he is also one of the least mature and is very dense in terms of relationships and understanding peoples feelings. Taiga is a character that is basically a dreamer that is trying to escape her family situation where she doesn't have a place to belong. She is slightly less dense about reading other peoples emotions than Ryuuji but isn't really good at taking care of herself and Ryuuji fills that gap of a parental figure that Taiga so desperately needs. Minori, while seemingly simple at first, has the biggest facade of all of the characters that she maintains to both conceal her feelings from others and also manage her own emotions, her forceful side is what comes out to ultimately help resolve the feelings between the cast. Kitamura seems to be a little more keen on the emotions of the group than Ryuuji or Taiga but has his own troubles resolving his own romantic conflict. There is a great change in his behavior once Kanou leaves where he becomes a really fun silly guy as opposed to being uptight and proper. Ami is a character that through working as a model has a better perspective for noticing a lot of things going on as far as relationships go, but while she has maturity in perspective, she lacks maturity in confronting and managing her own emotions. So it's very interesting to see that she has a better read on the entire situation than everyone but doesn't exactly have anything that she can do about it.\\n\\n\r\nWhile not being a complete review, the things I listed are some of the different things Toradora did to make me love the show. I highly recommend watching it if you are at all into romance and/or slice of life high school shows.\\n\\n\r\n10/10",

            "content": "- English Review (Translated version)\r\nI've been deeply disenchanted with \"Toradora!\". The worst of all is that it wasn't because of its genre (I knew perfectly what I was getting into), its characters (which have charisma and are well defined), or even the majority of its plot itself (it's a \"slice of life\", it is what it is). What was the problem then? What is made the final perception so bittersweet and disappointing, even with all the good that \"Toradora!\" has (which it has)? Well... its progression is horrible. Very horrible. Like a garden labyrinth in which you go round and round in a circle andfinally end up kicking a hole in the bushes.\\n\\n\r\nI'm going to try to explain myself in more detail, but first I'd like to talk about the good things about \"Toradora!\", so if you just want to read about the bad you can skip to the end of this review. The best thing about this anime are the characters, I have no doubt about that. The two main characters, Taiga and Ryuji, are a breath of fresh air. Each with his own personality, peculiar and very marked, charismatic and with great capacity to generate sympathy and empathy. In addition, together they form a great couple, truly fun and endearing. The secondary ones are not left behind either. Characters like Minori or Ami become indispensable. Very great group of characters except Kitamura, which seems to me a quite forgettable character, generic until to say enough and without any attraction. The good level is maintained even in secondary characters with little importance, such as Yasuko (although towards the end it becomes crucial), Haruta or the misunderstood teacher, who gives some of the best comic scenes of the show almost without pretending it.\\n\\n\r\nThe other strong point of \"Toradora!\" is its sound section. Without being the best in the history of anime, it does have a very remarkable quality. Their openings/endings are quite solvent and are perfectly placed in each episode to multiply their impact, which makes them look even better than they are. The OST in general is also very good, with several melodies bordering on a high level, stay in your mind and you end up recognizing instantly. I also wanted to mention the great work of dubbing/voice acting. I've never done it in any review, because in fact I've never paid much attention to the role of the \"seiyuu\" except in very specific cases. The fact is that in \"Toradora!\" I was struck by the voices in characters such as Taiga, Yasuko and especially Minori. Not only because of their voices themselves, which in the end match their character is the minimum, but also because of the spectacular amount of registers and nuances they have throughout the 26 episodes according to the moment.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I come to what has made me rethink my score and what has caused my final sensations, once the last episode has finished, have been so negative. As I said the development is very badly handled. The story swirls again and again in the same thing without advancing, except for very punctual moments (three or four perhaps) in which suddenly something shocking happens and everything takes a huge leap forward. On second thought, this structure is not far from any romance or \"slice of life\" anime, right? It is possible, but it is that... the end, the end is indefensible. I don't intend to value what is happening in itself, which is something more subjective (I personally think it's a horrendous choice on the part of screenwriters), but rather to focus on HOW it happens. Without making any spoilers, the final two episodes unleash a series of events in a ridiculously hasty way, very poorly explained and also (and this is what hurts me the most) completely incoherent with the tone of the plot and with the personalities of the protagonists. Without any sense. A disastrous final touch, a final touch that throws everything else to the ground. The epilogue after the last ending not only does not help to change this impression, but makes it even worse. I think it could hardly be worse. And it is a pity, because \"Toradora!\" has many good things and also a lot of potential, but it is totally wasted.\\n\\n\\n\r\n- Spanish Review (Original and faithful version)\\n\\n\r\nMe he llevado una profunda decepci\u00f3n con \"Toradora!\". Lo peor de todo es que no ha sido por su g\u00e9nero (sab\u00eda perfectamente d\u00f3nde me met\u00eda), por sus personajes (que tienen carisma y est\u00e1n bien definidos), ni siquiera por la mayor\u00eda de su trama propiamente dicha (es un \"slice of life\", es lo que es). \u00bfCu\u00e1l ha sido el problema entonces? \u00bfQu\u00e9 es lo que ha hecho que, a\u00fan con todo lo bueno que \"Toradora!\" tiene (que lo tiene), la percepci\u00f3n final haya sido tan agridulce y decepcionante? Pues... su desarrollo es horrible. Muy horrible. Como un laberinto de jard\u00edn en el que das vueltas en c\u00edrculo sin parar para acabar saliendo de all\u00ed abriendo un agujero a patadas en los arbustos.\\n\\n\r\nVoy a intentar explicarme con m\u00e1s detalle, pero primeramente me gustar\u00eda hablar de las cosas buenas de \"Toradora!\", as\u00ed que si solo quieres leer sobre lo malo puedes saltar hasta el final de esta review. Lo mejor de este anime son los personajes, de eso no tengo ninguna duda. Los dos protagonistas, Taiga y Ryuji, son un soplo de aire fresco. Cada uno con su propia personalidad, peculiar y muy marcada, carism\u00e1ticos y con gran capacidad para generar simpat\u00eda y empat\u00eda. Adem\u00e1s juntos forman una pareja genial, verdaderamente divertida y entra\u00f1able. Los secundarios tampoco se quedan atr\u00e1s. Personajes como Minori o Ami se vuelven imprescindibles. Grand\u00edsimo plantel de personajes exceptuando a Kitamura, el cual me parece un personaje bastante olvidable, gen\u00e9rico hasta decir basta y sin ning\u00fan atractivo. El buen nivel se mantiene incluso en personajes secundarios con poca importancia, como Yasuko (aunque hacia el final se vuelve clave), Haruta o la incomprendida profesora, que deja algunas de las mejores escenas c\u00f3micas de la serie casi sin pretenderlo.\\n\\n\r\nEl otro punto fuerte de \"Toradora!\" es su apartado sonoro. Sin ser lo mejor de la historia del anime, s\u00ed que tiene una calidad muy destacable. Sus openings/endings son bastante solventes y est\u00e1n perfectamente colocados en cada cap\u00edtulo para multiplicar su impacto, lo que hace que parezcan a\u00fan mejores de lo que son. La BSO en general tambi\u00e9n es muy buena, con varias melod\u00edas rayando a un gran nivel, de las que se quedan en tu mente y terminas reconociendo al instante. Tambi\u00e9n quer\u00eda mencionar el gran trabajo de doblaje/actuaci\u00f3n de voz. Nunca lo he hecho en ninguna review, porque de hecho nunca me hab\u00eda fijado demasiado en el papel de los \"seiyuu\" salvo en casos muy puntuales. El caso es que en \"Toradora!\" me han llamado la atenci\u00f3n en personajes como Taiga, Yasuko y especialmente Minori. No solo por sus voces, que al fin y al cabo que peguen con su personaje es lo m\u00ednimo, sino por la espectacular cantidad de registros y matices que tienen a lo largo de los 26 cap\u00edtulos seg\u00fan el momento.\\n\\n\r\nY llego a lo que me ha hecho replantearme mi puntuaci\u00f3n a la serie y a lo que ha provocado que mis sensaciones finales, una vez acabado el \u00faltimo cap\u00edtulo, hayan sido tan negativas. Como dec\u00eda el desarrollo est\u00e1 muy mal llevado. La historia remolonea una y otra vez en lo mismo sin avanzar lo m\u00e1s m\u00ednimo, salvo momentos muy puntuales (tres o cuatro quiz\u00e1) en los que de pronto ocurre algo impactante y todo da un salto hacia adelante enorme. Joder, pens\u00e1ndolo bien esta estructura no dista mucho de cualquier anime de romance o cualquier \"slice of life\", \u00bfno? Es posible, pero es que... el final, el final es indefendible. No quiero entrar a valorar lo que ocurre en s\u00ed, que es algo m\u00e1s subjetivo (a m\u00ed personalmente me parece una elecci\u00f3n horrorosa por parte de los guionistas), sino centrarme en C\u00d3MO ocurre. Sin hacer ning\u00fan spoiler, en los dos cap\u00edtulos finales se desatan una serie de acontecimientos de una forma rid\u00edculamente precipitada, muy mal explicada y adem\u00e1s (y esto es lo que m\u00e1s me duele) completamente incoherente con el tono de la obra y con las personalidades de los protagonistas. Sin ning\u00fan sentido. Un broche final desastroso, un broche final que tira por tierra todo lo dem\u00e1s y para m\u00e1s inri en el punto m\u00e1s \u00e1lgido de un anime. El ep\u00edlogo despu\u00e9s del \u00faltimo ending no solo no ayuda a cambiar esta impresi\u00f3n, sino que la empeora todav\u00eda m\u00e1s. Creo que dif\u00edcilmente se podr\u00eda hacer peor. Y es una pena, porque \"Toradora!\" tiene muchas cosas buenas y tambi\u00e9n mucho potencial, pero se queda totalmente desaprovechado.",

            "content": "Toradora is not just a romantic comedy or a comedic romance; it is both a comedy and a romance. If Toradora was simply either a romance or a comedy, I reckon it would still be pretty darn good. And that is how good i find Toradora to be.\r\nP.S- sorry but this review is kinda long so...\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nThe story revolves primarioy around Taiga and Ryuji. Ryuji loves Taiga's best friend and Taiga love Ryuji's best friend. And so they decide to help each other in their quest to attain the love of those who they each love. Simple right? Nope. Taiga can be described using most,if not all of the following words; psychotic, dangerous, insane, selfish, demanding, and brutal, despite her extremely small stature (she's only 5 foot 5 inches tall!!). On the other hand Ryuji is a kind, gentle, and caring boy whose eyes resemble those of someone who wants to hurt you and who has  a compulsive desire for everything to be orderly and hygienic. If the joining of two such personalities in the same quest of love isn't enough for you to be interested, then keep reading. Otherwise, go watch the first episode and I swear you will not be disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nThe first episode of Toradora is one of my favourite, if not my favourite, first episodes of any anime I've watched. It does an extremely good job of introducing your two main characters and it does so in a pretty hilarious fashion. But what I like most about this anime is that the quality of episode never really declines at all after the first one. The quality stays at a consistently high level throughout the entire anime. Eventually you meet all the other characters such as Taiga's love Yuusaku, Ryuji's love Minori, the fake face bitch Ami, and the assortment of other interesting and funny supporting characters.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I love so much about this story is that nothing exciting really ever happens in the lives of these students compared to other anime I have watched. Toradora uses seemingly simple everyday tasks and happenings to develop each character and their respective relationships with the other characters extremely well. However, having said that, each of the main characters aside from Ryuji have their own mini story arcs, whereby each character gets a little bit more screen time than they usually do. Unlike other anime I have seen like Kanon or Clannad, each arc doesn't place a complete focus on a single character but instead includes all the other characters. On top of that each arc contributes heavily to the overall story and it makes for a much more memorable watching experience.\\n\\n\r\nNow there are only two real small problems that I have with this anime and honestly, they are are really small problems so they night not affect your watching experience.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, I may just sound like I'm cocky but after I had finished the first episode, I knew what the outcome of the anime would be. However having said that, I would like to quote one of the Earth Kingdom nomad performers from Avatar: The Last Airbender; \"going to a destination is not about the destination but rather about the going\". I've been waiting to apply this quote to an anime for a long time and I finally got my chance. I knew what the outcome was going to be but it in no way lowered the quality of my watching expereince. Despite knowing what was going to happen, I still loved every moment and every scene this anime had to offer me. And even when the anime had reached its brilliant conclusion, one of which I had already known, I could not prepare myself for the emotions I felt in the final episode. However, having said that, I have to say that the anime did an earn extremely good job of convincing me that the outcome I had predicted was not going to be the case and at times during the anime, my confidence in the outcome I had predicted waned quite a bit, almost to the point where I completely scrapped my idea of what was going to happen.\\n\\n\r\nSecondly, *this is about the ending and despite the fact there are no spoilers I understand some people may not want to know anything about the ending so please skip this paragraph if you are on of these people* the final five or so minutes of the anime completely ripped my heart out and went on to mend it extremely quickly. After finishing Toradora, I just felt like too much was packed into the final few minutes. Despite, brilliant and emotion-evoking dialogue, I feel as though the final five minutes would've been better should there have been extra episode. Five minutes to rip out my heart and mend it just didn't seem like enough to satisfy me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI've already touched on the characters in the story category so I will be a bit more brief here. Every single character in this anime was unique and likeable, at least in my opinion. I've already described Taiga to you and honestly, she is the selling point for the show in the first few episodes. If you don't like girls with personalities like Taiga's, then you may not like this anime or the first few episodes may be a bit rough for you. However, as previously mentioned, I said that the character development and the development of their relationships is done extremely well in Toradora. This is particularly evident with Taiga. As the story begins to uncover the softer side of her personality and reveal more about her past, you start to see a Taiga that you may be more accustomed to.\\n\\n\r\nMy single flaw with the characters in this anime is Ami. I may have previously said that each character is developed extremely well and Ami is no exception. However, her screen time decreases quite a bit as the anime progresses and this disappoints me quite a bit. As a result her character development becomes stunted and she is reduced to the role of \"observer\" and occasionally she gets a few lines here and there; however many of these lines often go unheard by other characters and the final scene in which she says anything meaningful and worth contributing to the story is cut short and ultimately had no impact on me.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art in Toradora is nothing too special... when it doesn't want to be. However, when the anime wants to display a beautiful sunset, a wintry night, or a Christmas tree that is the life of the party, this anime can be extremely beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nDon't even get started on the OSTs in Toradora. They are brilliant. The openings and closings are catchy and I honestly really like them. Toradora'so closings are some of the few closing that I ever bothered to watch more than once because I just really liked them. There is also the Christmas song performed by Taiga and Ami which I loved despite only having listened to it once.\\n\\n\r\nAs for background music, it does an absolutely splendid job of amplifying the moods and emotions associated with their respective scenes. I have to give special mention to the OST or OSTs which started before a comedic moment. As soon as they we started I would always have a big grin on my face, ready to start laughing when the moment came and I feel as though this had a huge impact on the fact that I actually found Toradora absolutely hilarious. Similarly, the OSTs during sad moments also amplified the feels that I felt, particularly one which I cannot really pinpoint, otherwise I would need to spoil one of the anime's greater moments. It nearly made me cry listening to it outside of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting in the dub version (which is what I watch so deal with it) was brilliant. Taiga was nailed perfectly in my opinion, especially given the fact that her character must be an absolute handful to voice act. I also want to mention Ami's voice actor who was able to switch between bitch Ami and nice Ami extremely smoothly, and Minori's voice actor who gave so much life to a character who's ideals and beliefs are bigger than life itself. There isn't much I can really say about the other voice actors. They did fine jobs in their respective roles and none of the characters ever felt bland or out of place due to their voice acting.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 11/10 (rounded down to 10/10)\\n\\n\r\nI've never been much of a romance or comedy type of guy, opting instead for action and adventure. But Toradora captured my imagination and my heart only a few episodes into the series, landing it a place on my top 5 favourite anime of all time, possibly even my favourite. It was a viewing experience of the highest quality and I storngly, strongly, strongly recommend this anime to just about anyone, whether they are a fan of romance and comedy or not.\\n\\n\r\nI hope I helped you make a decision in whether you want to watch Toradora or not. Feedback is much appreciated!\\n\\n\r\nEdits: The name of the Christmas song is Holy Night and the sad song is Lost My Pieces should you want to check them out before starting the anime.",

            "content": "Toradora Review (for those not bothered by spoilers or who want to compare with me)\r\n\tI have recently watched an anime called Toradora. It was literally an anime about finding love. The anime starts off strong showing us our two main protagonists Taiga and Ryuji. The start of with a little epilogue where they are talking about something you can\u2019t see (love) and that if anyone found it everyone would want it. I have to admit that the only reason I even watched this anime was because I was trying to find some closure from another anime I watched recently, so this review may be biasedand it does contain spoiler ( MAJOR). I eally couldnt find a way to review this without breaking it down piece for piee as this wil also o on my youtube.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe show starts off good and strong showing that our main character Ryuji apparently looks scary and everyone is afraid of him (for the time being at least). It starts off with some guys running into him and after seeing his face they give him their lunch money, after which he returns it to the lost and found. Our main protagonist Ryuji has two main friends at this point, a Yusaku and Minori. These two pop up within the first fifteen minutes of the show and are pretty well thought out throughout the anime. After their introduction a girl named Taiga comes into the mix, she is a petite Lolita class character that seems to be in love with Yusaku.\\n\\n\r\n\tNow on with the plot, I will try to make this short and sweet for you so as not to give too much away. Ryuji find out that Taiga likes Yusaku, and Taiga finds out Ryuji likes Minori. They decide to work together to try and hook each other up with the ones they like. The thing is, Taiga lives alone and her lifestyle is not a healthy one, so Ryuji starts to take care of Taiga (with his mother\u2019s blessing of course) and everyone gets the wrong idea. Taiga is a character that I would call #2Tsun4Me as in she is Tsundere to the core. Taiga being Tsundere she cannot be honest with herself. Rumors start flying around that they are dating because they are always together and Taiga takes it into her own hands to clear them and Ryuji\u2019s name as well. So Ryuji\u2019s name is cleared, nobody thinks they are dating anymore, and Taiga confesses to Yusaku. Character development incoming, he rejects Taiga (and for good cause) and she is heartbroken. Ryuji was listening the whole time and we get a little (I forot the actual term sadly) \u201cspoiler\u201d when Ryuji says something, but I won\u2019t go into detail here.\\n\\n\r\n\tNow spinning away from the story a little bit, I don\u2019t like how much the anime skips although it makes sense after finishing it. So much days even weeks are skipped in the first few episodes. So in those episodes they are just doing character development for Taiga, Ryuji, and even a little for Minori. We find out that Ryuji is a crazy neat freak. Taiga is actually a little darling. And Minori is a crazy hard worker that seems to have gone through some tough times, which she has but again not going to go into that this early on.\\n\\n\r\n\tNow we fast forward to where the plot starts to thicken. A new character going by the name Ami comes into the mix. She is a model for a magazine that for some reason moves into their neighborhood and into their school. I am going to summarize this arc because it isn\u2019t too important for character development. Long story short, she moved there because she had a stalker. Ami has a problem with her personality. She acts all nice and cute but is really a mean person (though I admit it starts to turn softer and nicer towards the end). Ryuji helps her to overcome her stalker fear and assures her that her personality is what makes her herself and she should stop acting childish about it (this actually comes into play. BIGTIME). But for now all we know is that she seems to like him.\\n\\n\r\n\tNext is a little swimming contest that Taiga and Ami have to fight over Ryuji, Taiga loses because she can only kick and she goes to save Ryuji. We actually get a little taste of her true feelings (sorry I spoiled it a little, but it was so obvious and I need to put it in here) as she yells that he is hers. Again in this arc plot thickens as Ryuji tries to confess  to Minori  and we get a little mixed response, we don\u2019t know if she knows what he is talking about or not, but her answer is vague. We see that Taiga and Ami are starting to get closer (and it thickens as time goes on) even if they still tease each other.\\n\\n\r\n\tNow we will fast forward a bit into the future, Taiga\u2019s father has returned and we sort of want what Ryuji wants. He wants her to make up with her father (I have some sympathy with his character as my father was never around either). Ryuji does not listen to Taiga and what she thinks is best. So he sort of forces it on her to make her think it is her responsibility to make up with her father again. Minori is against this and ends up fighting Ryuji over it. Long story short things don\u2019t pan out and Ryuji tries his hardest to make up for it. \\n\\n\r\n\tRyuji and Taiga are starting to realize their feelings for one another but can\u2019t come to grips with it. Ryuji has been caring for Taiga all this time and they keep getting closer. Taiga herself is being cared for and is starting to get used to Ryuji\u2019s family life. Come Christmas time the whole class is attempting to throw a Christmas party. A lot of crap happens but instead of waiting for Minori, Ryuji rushes over to where Taiga is to cheer her up (again, we see his feelings, but he does not realize them himself). After leaving Taiga to go back to the party to see Minori Taiga runs after him and screams his name, Minori is off to the side.\\n\\n\r\n\tAt the school Minori pretty much \u201cstraight arms\u201d Ryuji and denies his confession. This is where we see that Minori wasn\u2019t being honest either and is in love with Ryuji. Now we fast forward a bit more to where Yusaku is starting his temper tantrum stage. A lot happens, Yusaku is really in love with someone else. Taiga attacks the girl for not being straight-forward. Then everything seems fine for a bit. During the Valentines arc is where the story is starting to reach its climax (which is also pretty much the end).\\n\\n\r\n\tI actually skipped a huge part where Taiga unknowingly confesses to Ryuji during a winter trip accident. In this stage Taiga skips school to hang out with  her mom but our protagonists know nothing about it and Ryuji actually throws a fit over it (again showing his true feelings). But away from that tangent, Ryuji and Taiga are covering Ryuji\u2019s mom on her job. After Minori confronts Ryuji and Yusaku for lying about who saved Taiga, a lot of drama ensues and you can see that the anime is finally reaching its end and things are finally getting good. It is the typical high school drama and I have to admit it was pretty awesome.\\n\\n\r\n\tAfter this confrontation though, another one follows with Taiga and Ryuji\u2019s moms. They finally confess to one another their true feelings and we have this huge bit with Ryuji\u2019s mom finally coming to terms with her parents. It does have a happy ending, albeit a clich\u00e9 one.\\n\\n\r\n\tSo for my final grade or ranking of this anime, I would have to say it is a solid 7/10. The anime was good, but the start is what got me. If it didn\u2019t skip around so much it would probably be an 8/10. The character development was also a letdown. Sure we as the audience already knew what was going to happen, but I still feel like it could have done better. The end also seemed to be a bit rushed. I would have loved to have seen more drama. After the first fight everyone just seemed to come to terms with everything and just up and went out of their ways to help out. It seriously felt like the last few episodes could have dragged on a little longer than it did. I would have liked to hear more from Ryuji\u2019s grandparents. We find out his dad didn\u2019t really die, and I would have loved some closure on that topic. I am not even going to mention the wedding as I would have loved to have seen one, but seeing how they were rushing the last few episodes, I guess we didn\u2019t really need one.\\n\\n\r\n\tSo this is my review, I would recommend this anime to those looking for a \u201cslice of life\u201d, comedy, romance hybrid.\\n\\n\r\n-snocown\\n",

            "content": "It's been a long time since I last gave a score of 10 to an anime. I started watching Toradora cuz I used up all the anime recommended to me, and ran outta options. To be honest, I stumbled upon Toradora many times in the past and I didn't give a damn about it cuz it looked kinda childish to me, but man, how WRONG I was. Never judge a book - anime in this case - by its cover, so to speak. Let's cut to the chase and start the review.\r\n*the review doesn't contain any spoilers, major or minor* \r\nStory: 10/10\r\nAt first glance, you'dsay the story's unoriginal - highschool students who have a crush on their classmates with some comedy - a highschool romcom, in short - but it doesn't end here. I wasn't a big fan of romance cuz I've gone through many failed attempts to watch romance anime; they all turn out to be either extra mawkish, fatally boring, totally ridiculous or absolutely incoherent. Toradora is the first - and I fervently hope not the last - romance anime I watched that captivated me.\\n\r\nThe narration itself is neither strictly linear nor episodic. Each episode is linked to the other in a smart, simple way, so once you start watching, you'll never stop.\\n\r\nThe romance is the teasing type if you catch my drift; not the I-love-you-from-episode-one anime which almost always ends up exessively mushy, nor is it the save-a-damsel-in-distress type you find in Sword Art Online. It leaves you with that feeling when you smile by yourself like an idiot when you're thinking about someone you love, yes that one. I've had that expression on my face almost throughout the entire series.\\n\r\nAs for the comedy, there's a lot of humor and funny moments. In fact, I'm not sure when I should laugh and when I shouldn't since the smile never leaves my face while watching the show.\\n\r\nIt also has elements of slice of life. There's no fan service, thank God, and most importantly it ends right where it should. The ending's gonna leave you satisfied - no cliffhanger and wait-for-a-sequel crap. The bottom line, the story is epic.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 11/10\\n\r\nHere's where the anime shines the most. All of the characters are adorable, humorous and individually unique, especially the main ones. You can't hate anyone in the show, on the contrary. The relationship between the main characters is nice and enviable. All main characters are well developed and have their own unique personalities and stories, and you'll definitely relate and get attached to each one of them.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 10/10\\n\r\nThe animation is superb. The characters are nice, cute and gorgeous. Their appearances very much match their personalities, and there's no stupid faces - except for the bird. Even the way the characters move, walk, laugh, everything is just awesome.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nI watched the English dubbed version. The characters have awesome voice-overs, absolutely flawless. They fit each other perfectly.\\n\r\nThe music is nice, very suitable to the atmosphere. I liked the two opening themes, which I'd normally skip in most shows, but here I listened to them in every single episode. The only reason I'm giving it 9 out of ten is because the score's not so great to the extent that I'd add it to my tracklist, and listen to it day and night.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nOh, you're so gonna enjoy every single bit of the show, I guarantee it. Toradora is exciting in every aspect. You're gonna be engrossed in the show before you know it, time will go fast and the next thing you know, it's 5 a.m and I haven't gone to bed yet. Simply addictive. You'll get attached to the show so much so that you'll feel empty and depressed after it ends. I went on and watched the whole series all over again right after finishing it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTo sum it up, Toradora is a real masterpiece. You rarely get to see a romance anime without ridiculous humor, over-sentimental, mushy characters and a plague in anime called fan service. My view of the romance genre underwent a 180\u00b0 change after watching this show. I'm gonna look for another anime like this one right after I post the review. I highly advise everyone to watch the show. It's meant for both teenage and mature audiences, so enjoy it.\\n",

            "content": "I think we all need to take a step back and realize, what Toradora! has actually done for us. That is right, it has given us pretty much the definition of a good RomCom anime. Well, at least I've gotten that out of this show. Granted, I am not much of a romantic comedy advocate but I, being the cynical person I am, have to be quite impressed by a RomCom to even call it worth my interest. Even examples of good shows in this genre usually just set of my alarm clocks for BS I don't need to watch. But that is not thecase for Toradora! which  makes this pretty much the best anime of this genre I have watched to this day. \\n\\n\r\nThe charakters' arcs are of solid pace, their motivations are pretty clear and while seeing a bit more development in the earlier episodes would have helped me to get more invested, I can assure you, that it reaches a nice conclusion in the end. But what is really surprising for a show of a genre that is otherwise drenched knee deep in clich\u00e9 and annoying characters, is the multiple layers, almost every character has going for him or her. There is almost no one dimensional character in this cast, beside maybe the student council president, but her voice is sexy so I will let that slide just this once. They are all multi layered, interesting people with their own struggles and hobbies, that don't just exist to merely move the plot forward. While at first I was lead to believe that I didn't like the crush Taiga had on Kitamura for example, because I did not get, what she would see in him, I quickly came to the realization, that this was kind of intentional. \\n\r\nTaiga and even Ryuuji had to slowly realize their own feelings and come to therms with themselves, rather than kissing awkwardly in the first episode and then freezing the plot for about ten others. That is the case for far too many of these kinds of shows but that and many other cliched tropes are far beneath Toradora! \\n\\n\r\nWhen you have to boil this review down to anything, it is this. Toradora! is above so many things in this genre, that even I, a person deeply drenched in cynicism and highly allergic to even the slightest bit of good intentions found this show to my liking. \\n\r\nWhile still being above many of the more generic kinds of shows, it leaves many things to be desired though. But many of these problems are actually contributed to the genre itself and my personal taste, than to the show itself. It is no character study, no deeply cerebral piece of art, just something to warm my cold, frozen heart. \\n\r\nThere are no people acting like Uber Nutzoid Crazypants McGee, but rather tame and with that much more believable. But when you don't like RomComs even this will have a hard time convincing you. I caught myself at a weak moment liking this show, but it stuck and even now, after a while of letting it sink, I still like it. You will too, probably, maybe not, maybe you will hate it. The ending is predictable, but that is the point so there is, besides of lacking depth for certain characters, while for the most part still not being one dimensional, nothing else to fault the show for. A bit more depth to some of the cast would have been even better, but I still liked what I got. So will you love it or hate it? \\n\\n\r\nOnly one way to find out, isn't there.",

This is a main driving point for the story which will tie into the very first and last lines of this anime and after watching will leave u touched in ways your average animes cannot.\\n\\n\r\nRyuuji Takasu, an intimidating looking boy in love with Minori and whose best friend is Aisaka Taiga a short but vicious girl finds out that Taiga likes his best friend Kitamura and after a midnight assassination attempt by Taiga, works together so that their loves can be fulfilled. As the story progresses not only do they not get any progress, but they begin to realize their feelings for each other as they spent most of their time together.\\n\\n\r\nPlot development and character development is ongoing and through the course of these 25 seemingly short episodes, you will find that there is absolutely no fillers and that the characters are unique, funny, and heartwarming to watch. Everyone in a sense will get their mini arcs which consist of an episode or two but the main focus as you will notice is how the feelings for Taiga change over the course of the anime. As the story progresses, you will become attached to all the characters with feelings for everyone of them for all these characters are far from being recycled material.\\n\\n\r\nPlots and characters aside, Toradora also has a very catchy and addictive opening and ending tracks which are inserted perfectly to provide transitions into the start of an episode as well as transitioning into the end. Because of this, episode intros and endings are not abrupt which contributes into the overall enjoyment as well as leaving you wanting more (especially if you were watching it when it was being released weekly).\\n\\n\r\nIf you managed to read this far and asked yourself, \"do i want to watch this?\" my reply is that you most likely do. This story is not all about romance since it deals with family situations and that not everyone is content in life. To be more in depth, this is a more realistic romance story even if its  superficial at some points, but overall is an anime you cannot put down once you start.\\n",

            "content": "I\u2019m not going to hide the fact that I\u2019m a big fan of romance shows. In fact, Toradora is the first official anime that got me into watching anime and at the time, I believed that this show was a special romantic comedy that I would always cherish and remember. \r\nA few years later, I have watched a lot more anime and I can still say that Toradora is one of my personal favorites. Why? It\u2019s because Toradora does things the right way. \r\nKeep in mind that after about 2 years of watching anime, I say it\u2019s about time that I write a review andwhat better way to start my 1st review than with the anime that started it all for me: Toradora.\\n\\n\r\n[Story]\\n\r\nThe premise of Toradora is quite simple, but unique. The main protagonists, Ryuuji and Taiga, both have crushes on each other\u2019s respective friend, Yuusaku and Minori. The story basically follows Ryuuji and Taiga as they agree to help each other win the heart of their respective crushes: Ryuuji with Minori and Taiga with Yuusaku. To be honest, I thought the story was fairly predictable, but it\u2019s still unique because of how they executed it. Both Ryuuji and Taiga start off by heavily disliking each other and are only willing to work with one another to gain the ones that they\u2019re in love with. Definitely not your standard rom-com. The anime does a great job in making it\u2019s concept unique because it falls away from your standard romance clich\u00e9s and the way how they portrayed Ryuuji and Taiga growing closer with one another was something I never fully expected at first. In fact, the way they decided to develop Ryuuji and Taiga\u2019s relationship was unpredictable in of itself and I really appreciated that. The characters definitely deserve most of the credit for the actual unpredictability of the story and for its overall uniqueness from other rom-com. The story of Toradora also breaks cliches from other romance anime and leaves you with a satisfying ending.\\n\\n\r\n[Characters]\\n\r\nThis is definitely the category that Toradora truly excels at. One of the things that ticks me off in any romance anime is how some characters would sometimes \u201cforce\u201d drama for the sake of drama. Some of the decisions made by these characters to create drama can be unnecessary and annoying at times. For example, a main character sees his/her love interest talking to someone else and this results in a misunderstanding. But Toradora\u2019s cast avoids these clich\u00e9s and the interactions that they have with each other feel genuine and real. There are 5 main characters that appear: Ryuuji, Taiga, Minori, Yuusaku, and Ami. All of them go through some impressive development and their bond with each other is only strengthened by the well-executed interactions. Yes, there is still drama in Toradora, but the drama is convincing because the characters actually have a reason and a motive for the actions that they choose throughout the anime. I will have to say that if you\u2019re the type of person who hates tsunderes, then Toradora is an anime that you should probably stay away from because they didn\u2019t call Taiga the \"Queen of Tsunderes\" for nothing. Taiga starts off pretty much the very embodiment of what a tsundere is, but here\u2019s another major plus point for Toradora: Taiga can also be considered somewhat of a deconstruction of a stereotypical tsundere and the fact that she develops heavily throughout the series, turns her into a great character by the end if you are willing to give her a chance. I almost forgot to mention that Toradora breaks the romance anime cliche of having relationships remain unresolved or left open-ended. Trust me, Toradora actually resolves the relationships of its characters. \\n\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]\\n\r\nToradora was produced in 2008 by studio J.C. Staff and while I can say that the animation is pretty good for the most part, the art isn\u2019t the best part about this show. Don't get me wrong, I think the art in Toradora is good, but I\u2019m going to be completely honest here; Toradora does not have the greatest art ever. In fact, I\u2019ve seen better art in other anime of the same genre. Unlike most rom-coms that I have watched, Toradora\u2019s art is mainly above average and at first, I was even unsure about watching this show because the character designs weren\u2019t exactly my type. But don\u2019t let this little shortcoming prevent you from watching this fantastic rom-com. It\u2019s important not to judge a show by its cover. Make no mistake however, Toradora's animation should be praised for its consistency. I have to say that the animation in this show does a very good job of being consistent from start to finish and I don't think I can recall an episode where I had to complain about the animation being poor or something. My compliments to J.C. Staff for the animation.\\n\\n\r\n[Sound]\\n\r\nToradora\u2019s music was composed by Yukari Hashimoto, who composed music for other shows like Golden Time. Besides a few piano tracks that I really enjoy listening to, the soundtrack for the most part is nothing amazing to write home about. Honestly though, I don\u2019t need Toradora\u2019s soundtrack to be godlike or anything cause I watched this show for the story and characters and I got what I wanted. If I wanted to watch an anime with amazing soundtracks, I would watch anime having composers like Yuki Kajiura, Yoko Kanno, Joe Hisaishi, Kenji Kawai or something. One track that stands out to me in Toradora is \u201cLost My Pieces\u201d. It\u2019s a very nice piece that does a great job in portraying the emotions that\u2019s going on in that specific scene and definitely a track that I could listen to on its own. Lastly, I wasn\u2019t the biggest fan of the opening and ending themes, so yeah. Although I will have to admit that Toradora's first OP is pretty catchy in its own way.\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]\\n\r\nI truly enjoyed watching Toradora and the characters play a huge role in my enjoyment. I think I was able to enjoy Toradora to its fullest because no one completely steals the show here. Instead the 5 main characters I mentioned earlier develop great chemistry with one another that watching them interact with one another is already enough to get me excited. The fact that I\u2019m constantly trying to figure out how each relationship is going to be developed, definitely helped in my enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\n[Overall]\\n\r\nToradora is a unique and a fantastic rom-com. Honestly, I consider this show to be one of the greatest rom-coms that I\u2019ve ever watched and 2 years later, I\u2019m still saying that. Sure, Toradora is not perfect and in fact has its share of problems though I refuse to mention these issues due to spoilers. Would I recommend watching Toradora? Definitely yes. If you\u2019re a person that wants a unique rom-com with fantastic characters and assuming you can be patient with tsunderes, then Toradora is right up your alley. Thank you for reading my 1st review and remember that this is just my opinion and my opinion alone. If you think my review is helpful in convincing you to watch Toradora then that makes me really happy and if it doesn\u2019t, I\u2019m already happy knowing that you at least decided to read my review in the first place.",

            "content": "(7.0/10)\r\n\"Love is something that's bittersweet\" \r\nI know quoting lines from the show is a ridiculously cliche way to start a review, but bear with me. If it works it works. \r\nThat's kind of the special thing about Toradora, if it works, and it does, it works. There can be cliches, tropes, and some pretty \"anime\" things in it, but if it works, it works. \r\nThis may be my first Japanese Rom-Com, but I feel like once I see one, I've seen them all. Maybe its because a lot of these cliche's are almost cliche to complain about. Or maybe its because a lot of themare shared with their western counterparts. Whatever it is, Toradora is both something I feel like i've seen before, but not in a bad way. \\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\nI'll be splitting this review up in two sections. Much like this show, i'm going to keep it simple. Pros and Cons. \\n\\n\r\n_______________________________________\\n\\n\r\nPROS: \\n\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that I've noticed very quickly is the astounding work by Studio J.C Staff. Their effort to bring the characters to life is inspiring. The animation is vivid, frantic, and colorful. The last thing I was expecting is exemplary animation in a shounen, a genre that's become synonymous with slow-panning still-images. \\n\\n\r\nIts so nice to see movement happen almost constantly on screen. I see characters have a lot of personality in their movements, their glances, their smiles, and their frowns. I can't reiterate how nice this is. It gives the show an immediately appealing vibe. I don't feel like i'm watching someone flip pages of a manga in front of me, occasionally shaking the pages to create a sense of urgency.\\n\\n\r\nInstead, I get an environment that's instantly like-able. Characters are easier to distinguish and remember when each one has their own unique way of... oh I don't know, greeting one another. Needless to say, J.C Staff outdid themselves with the animation, even if the art design was flawed. More on that in the Cons section. \\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was also good. While not as great as the art, the opening themes were catchy and actually had lyrics that correlated with the actual show. I prefer this infinitely to some stupid self-righteous and vague intros that I see so often in Shounen anime. \\n\\n\r\nFor example, I decided to look up the lyrics to one of the few Fate/Zero intros : \\n\\n\r\n                      \"My feet I moved in are \\n\r\n                 Softly healed by my faraway ideals. \\n\r\n     I grip tightly onto these certain bonds and move ahead, no matter where, \\n\r\n             The miracle that cut through the impurity on my back.\"\\n\\n\r\nWhat. \\n\\n\r\nOr : \\n\\n\r\n                    \"In actuality, everyone wants to be saved, \\n\r\n                 And their wandering hearts pierce a hole in the sky.\"\\n\\n\r\nWhat does that even mean?! \\n\\n\r\nWhat Toradora does above other Shounen is actually semi-creatively make the intros ABOUT the show. In fact, the line I started the review with is from the opening theme. They're catchy and set the tone pretty well. Especially the one in the second half of the show, delivering a slightly more emotional opening. \\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhile the characters are either unmemorable or simply established (more on this in the Cons section), there is one character that absolutely shattered my expectations going into the show. She did this for a specific few reasons that I had a lot of trouble coming to terms with. \\n\\n\r\nTaiga. \\n\\n\r\nMind you, i'm not one of those \"see a cute girl and absolutely fawn-over her\" types. In fact, I value myself as a steel-heart-having emotional brick wall that doesn't get phased or distracted by some meddling anime character. And while I may sound like a Scooby-Doo villain, I promise this has always been what i've been like with television. \\n\\n\r\nIn fact, when Taiga, our main girl protagonist first made her appearance, I hated her. Not the \"oh gosh golly she's annoying\" kind of hate, either. The \"Man, are there any freight trains around the area that can do me the great favor of derailing and crushing this self-righteous asshole?!\"- Kind of hate. \\n\\n\r\nI despised her. Everything about her was almost irredeemably bad. And for every ounce of perfection the main character dripped, what with his cooking skills, fatherly nature, kindness, etc. It seems like the writers packed every negative trait into this tsundere Loli. \\n\\n\r\nBut man, did she ever grow on me. Maybe its the icy cages around my heart beginning to slowly melt with old age. Or maybe its the fact that the writers and animators of the show tactically created this hobbit-sized doll. This is what i'll be attempting to explain. \\n\\n\r\nAs a person, I think that liking someone as a character because their cute is a very shallow way to go about this. Especially for someone like me who's a hard ass and a very rough critic of everything. Its just shallow and lame to be like, \"Well, she's a horrible person... but look at those cute little blushes!\" \\n\\n\r\nBut that's kinda where the show's creative team excelled at. Since this show is aggressively for men, in my opinion (I'll get into this in my Cons), our inherent fatherly instinct gets triggered whenever we see someone like this. \\n\\n\r\nShe's painted as a hopeless, lonely, angry, unknowing, and arrogant little girl and we want nothing less than to help her find her way. It feels shallow, but its a very smart move by the creators. They made her short, and by that I mean REALLY short. I wanted to look this up and apparently there are actual metrics for anime characters. They say she's exactly four feet and nine inches. That's TINY! \\n\\n\r\nNot only is she short, she's also very small. She encompasses a small space. I don't even mean height-wise. The first real time we see her in a non-aggressive light is her rolling out of a thin locker. \\n\\n\r\nShe is also often shown hiding her face, which is another sign of \"weakness\". And by weakness I mean the kind that you see in a tiny little kitten on the road. \\n\\n\r\nAgain, a very tactical move by the staff and i'm assuming the actual Light Novel writer who made these characters in the first place. She's utterly perfect for this kind of role and while I feel shallow saying this, I found myself totally in love with her character by the end of the series. \\n\\n\r\nFor someone like me, this is an amazing transition, since i'm usually really petty with these kinds of things. If I start out hating something, its really hard to win me over! But Taiga is absolutely adorable and an awesome example of character design done perfectly! \\n\\n\r\nI wish the same could be said about literally any other character in the show, but one is enough. I'll take it. I'll take this. \\n\\n\r\nHer story has a nice progression to it too. By the end of the series you feel like you are still watching the same character, but a more developed version... which is the mark of solid character development. \\n\\n\r\nBy the time she really becomes more sincere and not-constantly-angry, chances are, you'll already be into her story. So if there's one thing elevating the \"character\" portion of the review to \"above average\" and not just \"average\" its this adorable plucky tsundere, Taiga. \\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis leads me to my shortest point. In a romantic show, inevitably, there will be cliche romantic scenes. Things like the \"initial breakthrough\" when a tough-on-the-outside-but-creamy-on-the-inside character finally breaks down. Or the \"main character has dramatic realization about something to do with romantic shit\" cliche. There are a lot. \\n\\n\r\nToradora does them all. But for the most part, they're done well. Especially an earlier scene in the show that was one of the most heartbreaking emotional explosions I've seen in anime. \\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nLastly, the story in Toradora is literally nothing special. But that's what makes a lot of it so deftly done. It baths in Rom-Com cliches from head to toes, but it does them (mostly) in a pretty solid way. \\n\\n\r\nI never found myself actually groaning at much of these cliches being done. Believe it or not, that's an achievement. In a genre that's plagued with unoriginal and hack writing, relying solely on cliches to tell a story... its really nice to see a show take these cliches and if not go somewhere else with them, at least do them in a way that isn't abrasive as hell. \\n\\n\r\nThat deserves a mention in the Pros section. A cliche romantic comedy that actually feels nice and solidly crafted... for the most part. \\n\\n\\n\r\n_________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nCONS: \\n\\n\\n\r\nAt its very core, there are three major flaws in the show. Three things that brought this show down a solid point. For this section, i'll be separating them into three parts. \\n\\n\r\n...\\n\r\nGuy Characters\\n\\n\\n\r\n1.) Comedy \\n\\n\\n\r\nThis is something I have to inevitably bring up. As much as I hate it, this is a romantic comedy. Comedy is in the genre title. Its something that's inherently a part of the show so as someone who is resigned to review the show, I have to bring this aspect of it under the microscope. \\n\\n\r\nBluntly, this show isn't funny. Its not offensively NOT funny like a lot of anime i've seen ... looking at you FMA! But I can count on one hand the parts of this show that got anything more than a slow exhale out of my nostrils. \\n\\n\r\nA lot of anime, especially Shounen anime, has this overdone comedy elements to it where every joke has to be rubbed in your face. As if you are too stupid to get subtlety so they have to yell the joke really loudly to make sure you get it. \\n\\n\r\nI don't find this funny so I didn't really find this show all too funny. Some of the comedy elements thankfully had a bit more heart to them which made them cute, if anything. Of course this mostly has to do with Taiga, who, as I've said in the Pros section, carries this show on her little butterfly back. \\n\\n\r\nBut unfortunately \"cute\" and \"heart-having\" aren't two things that make a show funny. So unfortunately, this has to be a negative. While it isn't huge and by no means show ruining, if you are like me and dislike very \"in your face\" comedy, then I doubt you'll laugh at this show too much.\\n\\n\r\nMore so than not, I found myself grinning with certain characters, which honestly is better than a lot of Romantic comedies can make me do. But still, not even close to the standard that needs to be set. \\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\\n\r\n2.) Anime Ways \\n\\n\\n\r\nThis is an inevitable continuation of my criticism above. Unfortunately, overdone comedy isn't the only thing that I get frustrated at with anime, especially Shounen shows. \\n\\n\r\nJust like with their lack of comedic subtlety, I find that a lot of anime has a problem with doing dramatic subtlety too. While this isn't as big of an issue as the comedy not landing, a few scenes in the show that were made to have a huge emotional punch didn't land due to them being too hammy.\\n\\n\r\nOne scene which book ended an arc in particular was so jarringly stupid and out of nowhere that it honestly ruined any emotion I had stirring inside me. This cliche culture festival arc itself was never the most interesting, but its inability to stick the landing made it one of the more negative aspects of the show. It felt like the show spinning its wheels. \\n\\n\r\nAnother scene where a character comes to a realization regarding their love with another character is initially done with tact, but a very obvious monologue in the middle of their dramatic and emotionally powerful realization makes the scene land slightly tilted. Whilst it isn't nearly as bad as the missed landing with the culture festival arc, its still jarring enough for me to wish that they went for a more subtle approach to storytelling that maybe, just maybe, could've gotten me a little misty eyed. \\n\\n\r\nMonologues have always been an aspect of anime. This is because Light Novel adaptations have to include the characters thoughts, which are so prevalent in novels. I get that. But certain scenes just don't translate into a visual medium that well if the studio and writers don't put the effort into altering them to become more applicable to said medium. \\n\\n\r\nNot only that, there's also a glaring issue with character design. While Taiga is universally an a amazingly designed character, there is literally nothing after that. Every other character is just generic. The best thing I can say is that their hair color matches their personality. Minorin is spunky red. Ryuuji is stern and collected blue. And Kitamura is dull-as-fuck black. \\n\\n\r\nA hilariously dumb occurrence in this show is when the characters praise the class model, Ami's, body. She's a model, so clearly she has to be fit and gorgeous! Yet the shows character design doesn't reflect that at ALL! Every girl character that isn't Taiga looks like they have the same body as one another! Its hilarious but unfortunately a complete flaw in the shows character design.\\n\\n\r\nAnd this flaw is something that I see constantly in anime. \\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\\n\r\n3.) Guy Characters \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nLook. I can go on about how Minorin feels tacked onto scenes half the time. I can go on about how her presence often feels disruptive due to her very unbelievable eccentricity. I can make this the focal point of this third, and final, section. But no. Although she is generally pretty unbearable as a presence, she is FAR from the worst offender. \\n\\n\\n\r\nGuy characters in this show is what keep it from being a great romantic comedy. Its Shounen guys-appeal roots keep it from maintaining themes that its been building the foundation of the show with. \\n\\n\r\nThis sucks. In all honesty, it really sucks. This sucks because many times I felt like Taiga was too good and likable of a character to be placed into such a shallow love triangle. I actually felt sorry for a character on the META level. Yes, I am a douche bag, nice to meet you. \\n\\n\\n\r\nRyuuji Takasa, our protagonist, is a nice, awesome, likable, good-food-cooking, strong, fatherly, friend-having, supportive, guy. Notice anything wrong there? He's literally perfect. \\n\\n\r\nIn fact, a later imperfection that arises from this character still just stems from his childhood, so blaming a kid for having a SMALL amount of emotional issues isn't really an imperfection, is it? Even his problems aren't really HIS problems! He's perfect! He resembles literally no guy I've ever met. In fact, I can't describe anyone I've ever known to be perfect. \\n\\n\r\nYet, he, as well as Kitamura, is perfect. With this perfection lays an unconvincing narrative between Ryuuji and Taiga. For the first while their relationship just doesn't seem like something realistic because of his perfection.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, the one imperfection they wanted to establish early on is that Ryuuji has \"creepy eyes.\" Seriously, show? Creepy eyes? That's the best you can come up with? Even his \"imperfection\" is something he's BORN with and can't actually change. Its even dropped fairly quickly too!\\n\\n\r\nMeanwhile Taiga deals with very real insecurities regarding her body. Her breast size and overall body structure leads to some undoubtedly relatable moments for girls. \\n\\n\r\nBut If i was a girl I feel like i'd be very uncomfortable watching this show. Every girl character that's on screen constantly has some sort of emotional issue. Ryuuji's Mom, Minorin, Ami, Taiga, hell, even the blue haired school president who I don't even remember the name of ended up having repressed emotional issues!\\n\\n\r\nLike, come on, show! Why are you making it so unbelievably weird? Why not give every guy character at least a modicum of respect when it comes to writing. Why are they either one-note joke machines or just sterile perfection? It makes it seem like they're saving a bunch of helpless girls from loneliness rather than a relationship that goes both ways... like a REAL relationship often does. \\n\\n\r\nIt just feels weird. It can even feel sexist at times. Bluntly, I disliked the way every single male in the show was characterized. While Ryuuji thankfully gets a tiny bit of a personality towards the end of the show, its not nearly enough to create for a super compelling narrative.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters bring stories together. If a story is bad, good characters can save that. While the story here is an admirable use of cliche's, its undoubtedly bogged down by characters who just aren't interesting enough to keep the story afloat. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[CONCLUSION] : \\n\\n\\n\r\nSo in conclusion, Toradora might just be one of the best romantic comedy I've ever seen. I never really loved \"Friends\", and I never really watched many anime romantic comedies either. Most romantic comedy movies are pretty god awful, too. With the exception of marvels like \"Me, Earl & the Dying Girl\", romantic comedies are just kind of shitty all around. \\n\\n\r\nReal recognize real, then. When a Rom-Com manages not to be horrifyingly awful, I can't help but praise it! Apart from maybe the solid sound work, I feel like every aspect of the show has very awesome highs, but also very noticeable lows. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is ridden with cliches, but their done well. If it wasn't for the over Shounen-ing of a few major elements the story may have stood out more. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is incredibly solid and lively, but the disappointing character designs drag it down to a 7. \\n\\n\r\nLastly, the characters have a lacking amount of effort put into them. Especially the guys. But that doesn't stop a small shining fractured star like Taiga to completely carry the show. \\n\\n\r\nLet me gush about her a little more, too. If you haven't seen this show do it just to see one of the cutest most love-to-hate-but-slowly-love-more characters I've ever seen. I doubt i'll be forgetting her presence on screen any time soon. She's great and the single reason that this show doesn't just sit at an \"above average\" but makes its way up to \"Good\" all around. \\n\\n\r\nSo to wrap up this review in the most cliche possible way, here's another cheesy quote. \\n\\n\r\n\"I hate waiting, but if waiting means being able to be with you I'll wait for as long as forever.\" - Taiga \\n\\n",

            "content": "Why do I watch romantic anime?\r\nTo feel all warm and fuzzy inside. For those hearty moments where the characters slowly discover their feelings for each other. For when they suffer from angst and uncertainty until the inevitable collision of feelings finally happens. For when they end up in each others arms.\r\nOn a realism scale, I rate toradora 7 out of 10.\r\nTaiga is a tsundere character at heart (rightfully referred to as the best one), frequently becoming violent. She is still a very lovable character who develops greatly and for me the main reason to watch the show. There is also a stupid, speaking parrot forcomic relief and the always sleepy/seductive mom of Ryuuji. At times you will laugh or shrug at wierd, more or less funny situations that it seems only anime writers could come up with.\\n\r\nWhat stands out are the 5 main characters, their interactions and their development.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMINOR SPOILERS (you can still watch it after reading):\\n\\n\r\nThe story is summarized as follows:\\n\r\nTaiga and Ryuuji meet and decide to help each other with their respective love interests. Naturally, as everyone already knows, they grow to love each other instead, which takes some time to set in. It is however not the story itself that is original, but rather the sensible and very rewarding execution. Both characters grow up quite a bit and come to many realizations during the course of the show.\\n\\n\r\nAs events unfold and develop, we get to see the characters feelings develop over their crushes, until the first \"bang\" happens in episode 8 in the form of Taiga  exclaiming her \"ownership\" over her \"dog\" Ryuuji (who nearly drowned in the pool) in tears in front of everyone. While exclaiming her ownership may not seem romantic at first, her tears gave a more accurate represntation of her feelings.\\n\r\nHowever, the next ~11 episodes, everything resumes back to normal and they more or less both go on about their days, with Ryuuji trying to pursue his own love interest, Minori (Taiga's best friend), when arguably one of the best episodes comes along: the christmas episode.\\n\r\nHere, Ryuuji is being his usual oblivious self and comforting Taiga, who spends Christmas Eve alone.\\n\r\nHowever, Taiga begins to realize her true feelings and this is followed by a tragic, beautiful moment, supported by the best track in the OST and worth all the build up to that point.\\n\r\nAfter that, nothing is the same, and everything gets concluded slowly, but yet so heartbreakingly well and satisfying over the last 6 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe last episode includes one of the best scenes I have seen from romantic anime, but I choose to ignore the controversial second half of it.\\n\\n\r\nIf I had to name a flaw, maybe it is that the whole premise is based on our main guy, Ryuuji, being completely oblivious to what is going on most of the time, but I did not care one bit: the homely day to day scenarios, the surprisingly great and deep character developments and the romantic conclusion made me completely overlook that.\\n\\n\r\nSo if you, like me, want to find out how exactly Ryuuji and Taiga end up together, do not hesitate one second to watch toradora.\\n",

            "content": "Toradora is a lovely and funny anime with curious characters and a beautiful story. Its name is based in a relationship with the Tiger (Aisaka Taiga) and Dragon (Takasu Ryuji). It's easy to know how the story will end, but there is all a so much interesting plot behind this. Check it out!\r\nIn begining, you're introduced to Ryuji, the Dragon. He is a cold fish, very intimidating and mysterious for the most of people, but, in truth, he is a nice guy, smart and gentle with everyone who wants come close to him. Kitamura Yusaku is one of this people and a very clever anddedicated member of the student council. He is Ryuji's best friend and Taiga's crush. Yeah, Taiga is fallen in love with him and fails miserably with her mission to send him a love card, making her enter in a peculiar situation with Ryuji, when she discovers that he's in love with her best friend, Kushieda Minori. Taiga is in love with Ryuji's best friend and Ryuji is in love with Taiga's best friend... Let's make a deal! Ryuji only imagined that it could be more easy and less exhausting, haha!\\n\\n\r\nMy favorite character is, with no doubt, Minori. She is so cute and adorable and charming and funny and... Aaah!!! She is perfect, hahaha!\\n\r\nKawashima Ami appears a little bit late, but she's an awesome girl too, she is the truest of them all. (That's so paradoxal!) With a so much common charm, she is a gem and deserves a spotlight here.\\n\r\nYusaku also is a character full of highlights, as your responsability sense and enthusiasm. He's cute, no?\\n\r\nBut, can I be honest with you? The protagonists broke me down a little. Taiga is called by Palmtop Tiger, so you can wait a girl with much fisical strong and little mental maturity. And Ryuji accepts her rough treatment like a dog. (Jokes for after, please, rs.)\\n\r\nSo, my grade for them is 7, my average.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough Toradora be a 2008 production, there is an excellent work with the art and sound. The music are catchy, the characters and scenarios much well drawed, there is so much beautiful effects and the openings are simply perfects! My grade could be 10 so much easy, but the ending songs make no sense.\\n\r\nYeah, it's weird. Really.\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment wasn't so high and I don't know if I'm too older for this or if for another reason. Anyway, I see Toradora as a good distraction and it has an fair enjoyment, like the grade 6 sugests.\\n\\n\r\nSo, overall, my grade is 7. If you are a fan of shoujos and romance, it's an anime that will not disappoint you and if you aren't, it will surprise you! Take a good look in Toradora and I hope I helped you.",

            "content": "\"If you trip while running down a hallway, you\u2019ll get a nosebleed. If you trip in life, you cry.\"\r\nAfter about 6 months of hearing all the constant chatter about how amazing Toradora! is, I  decide to watch it. I've seen quite a few of RomComs, such as Lovely Complex and Zero no Tsukaima, and I've been a fan of them for a while. The only problem with RomComs these days is that they either suck, or they have an unoriginal story to it. Very rarely do I find a RomCom now a days that deserves anything above an 8, and I was actually reallyhappy once I started watching Toradora, 'cause this is one of the rare RomComs I was just talking about. I don't know what made me love it the most, but I can definitely say that this inparticular RomCom is one of my most favorites of all time.\\n\\n\r\nTo start off, I'll give you a brief idea about what the story is about. We have Takasu and Taiga, who are both known in the school as \"Dragon and Tiger\". It start's off pretty normally, Takasu has a crush on Minori, the friend of Taiga, and Taiga has a crush on Kitamura, the friend of Takasu. Once Takasu and Taiga find out they've been living right next door to eachother, they decide to help eachother out by trying to set eachother up with their friends. With that, there are many moments full of laughter, romance, heartbreak, and plain old fun. It may sound like a clich\u00e9 storyline, but the way they made this anime makes it the opposite of a clich\u00e9. I was satisfied for most of the show, despite the ending being the slightest bit anti-climactic. Overall, the story was very well made, and the comedy thrown into it makes Toradora definitely worth watching.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork was great. I liked how the characters were portrayed, their looks seem to fit their personalities, at least except for Takasu. You don't see many tall, scary looking guys who are obsessed with cleaning and cooking. Taiga's character was probably my favorite in terms of appearance. The fact that she can kick ass at 4'7\" is amazing. Other than her shortness, she brings this kid-like cuteness mixed in with a sexy-like cuteness... she definitely gave off some weird vibes, but I didn't care, I still loved her.\\n\\n\r\nRie Kugimiya, the goddess of Tsundere voice-acting roles! Voiced the best character in Toradora (Taiga again)! Her and her professionalism made Taiga practically perfect, and she has an amazing voice when it comes to singing as well, good Lord. Junji Majima rocked Takusu's voice as well. His calm-like personality made Takasu even more funny during comedic situations. Everyone else practically nailed their roles, the voice acting was grade A.\\n\\n\r\nTaiga. Taiga is still my favorite. She made it on my \"Top 10 Female Anime Characters\" list. I don't know whether it's because I'm a fan of Tsunderes, or because she's just plain lovable, but she was my favorite character in Toradora. Her personality made it even easier for me to love her, and I'd be surprised if there were any Taiga-Haters out there, because if there were, I'd need to go slap some sense into them. Takasu was really cool, he made it onto my \"Top 10 Male Anime Characters\" list... in otherwords, there were quite a few nominees in this anime that could have made it onto my list. Takasu is like the ideal partner. Ladies who can't cook or clean, here you go, Takasu is your man. Next theirs Minori. Hyperactive and funny, but at the same time, I kept getting mad at her at some points. There wasn't anything I hated about her, it's just some moments in this anime that made me think I did. Once you watch, you'll understand. Next there's the Chihuahua (Kawashima). Snobby model/actress personality made her seem like the villain of the show. Luckily she wasn't. She actually proved herself to be one of the most reliable characters on the show, helping people with their love life and such. Finally, there's the God of Unrequited Love (AKA Kitamura). When I heard that nickname I thought, \"What the hell?\". Other then that, he seemed like a funny guy, but I did question his stripping habits in a few of the episodes. But he's the ideal best friend. Overall characters in this show were all awesome!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyed every minute of every enjoyable second. Got sad every minute of every sad second. Laughed every minute of every funny moment. This is your ideal RomCom (God, so many \"Ideals\" in this...). If you're looking for good comedy, romance, and enjoyableness... enjoyability... wait, what... anyways, look no further, Toradora is the anime for you. I recommend this to everyone, even if you don't like RomComs and are more of the action/sci-fi/thriller/whatever genre that isn't Romance or Comedy type, watch this. It'll be well worth it, I assure you.",

            "content": "Toradora....where do i begin. This show is easily the best anime show I've seen in a long time, and that's saying something. Everything about it is everything i like in a good romance. The story begins with Ryuuji and Taiga first meeting. let me explain them first. \r\n     Taiga is a rough and tuff girl who wont take and crap from anybody, she is however small so this being the fact she is called the palmtop tiger, it is also later shown that her agressiveness is due to a rough childhood.Ryuuji on the other hand is quite a soft, though everyone is afraid of him because he resembles his dad (who I think he was supposed to be like a realy bag guy, they didn't go much in depth in that area) he is very nice, and unlike Taiga is actually kind of a pushover. Anyway back to what i was saying\\n\\n\r\n     Taiga is caught by Ryuuji trying to put a love letter to kitamura in his bag, but ends up putting it in Ryuuji's bag. Ryuuji finds it and is tempted to read it, but he resists. Then Taiga rages in and attacks Ryuuji with a wooden sword. Once things have calmed down Ryuuji tells Taiga about the poems and what not he writes for Minorin. seeing that they each have simialar goals, and the fact that their love interest is the other best friend. They decide to work together and help each other in getting that person. However it is not very smooth sailing\\n\\n\r\n      Taiga is very timid around kitamura so she never can really push herself to do anything that Ryuuji plans out for her. she can barely say a word to him at the beginning of the show but towards the end she is more open with him. This I think is due to the fact that she is realising that she likes Ryuuji instead, this however doesn't happen till near the end.\\n\\n\r\n      Ryuuji is not near as timid around Minorin as Taiga is with kitamura, but he still mumbles his words now and then. He as well has issues with pushing himself to do what Taiga plans out for him. Toward the very end it is revealed that Minorin actually does like Ryuuji.\\n\\n\r\n      Taiga and Ryuuji spend alot of time together because of the fact that Taiga lives alone. Ryuuji cooks for her just about every night. Because of this Ryuuji's mother considers Taiga part of the family.\\n\\n\r\n      Later on as Taiga and Ryuuji spend more time together, (though they never say till the very end) they end up having feelings for each other. It does take a while for them to realise it, so sit tight and keep watching. because it is worth it.\\n\\n\r\n      one of the best traits about Toradora is it's suspense. I don't know how they were able to put so much suspense in a drama/romance but they did. For me this show left me wondering after every episode. It made me think and want to know what was in the next episode. I had to seriously force myself away from the computer in order to stop watching it. Because after every episode you WILL want to know what happens next!!! I gaurantee it.\\n\\n\r\n      Another thing about Toradora. I know in retrospect it is pretty obvious that Taiga and Ryuuji will be together, and I thought that would ruin it for me...but...it really didn't. Because though it may be obvious, it doesn't really seem sensible. It doesn't seem like they'll end up together at the beginning even though you know they will. It's crazy how this show does it but it does it excellently.\\n\\n\r\n      I would recommend this show to anyone who likes drama/romance cause this show does both of those PERFECTLY!! and i don't say that lightly. The background's on the character and the storyline would have made the show good even if there was no romance. I would highly recommend this anime.\\n\\n\r\n      Story (8) - I am giving this story an 8. Because though it did have interest, and left you wanting to know what happened. It is lacking in resolve. considering Taiga's family that is. At the end of the show Taiga's family is still mad at her for leaving, and they don't really resolve that. Though she does end up going back for a year.\\n\\n\r\n      Art (9) - I give this show a high 9 on art. The design of the character's wasn't my favorite design, but the show still made it work out. The art was masterful in my opinion. The work of a genius.\\n\\n\r\n      Sound (10) - I am giving the sound a 10 for various reasons. The emotion in this show could be felt throughout every episode. It was like you could almost feel the person's pain. even when the side character had a moment it was great. The sound is really Toradora's shining moment.\\n\\n\r\n      Character (9) - I am giving character's a 9. This is the kind of show that you will definitely like all of the characters. Even if you didn't like a character from the start (for me it was Minorin) you will like them towards the end. The backgrounds on all of them are all unique and all interesting. No one's background in this show is boring.\\n\\n\r\n      Enjoyment (10) - I have never watched a show that I have enjoyed more than Toradora. As i said before it will leave you in suspense after every episode. it will be 4 am in the morning and you will be finishing episode 17. It will end and you will lie their with your mouth open. Then you will scream because you want to go to bed but you don't want to stop watching it (WARNING!! if you don't like staying up really late than i would sudgest not watching Toradora at night.)\\n\\n\r\n      Overall (10) - as for the overall it obviously get's a 10. Which are well earned points. This story will not dissappoint you if you like drama/romance that leave you suspenseful and wondering. Not to mention really excited at some points. P.S. Ryuuji and Taiga do kiss at the last episode. =)\\n",

            "content": "Starting Toradora was kinda interesting for me, the main reason why I picked it up was that I was told through a friend that it's one of the best (if not the best) anime in its type of genre. Curious on that claim, I decided to give it a shot to see if it met my expectations.\r\nThe story itself is pretty simple and basic, taiga loves ryuuji's best friend, and vice versa for ryuuji to taiga's best friend. Both decide to help each other out in following their love's path set out for them. As the show goes on though, it becomes less about tryingto get together with who they love, and more about understanding why they love, who they really love, what love really is. I won't lie, it's probably a really predictable story on how it ends since it certainly won't shock anyone by the ending, but the show is not about the ending; it's about the progression to that ending.\\n\\n\r\nI think what stuck out to me most about toradora was its characters, and I don't mean just the main ones of taiga and ryuuji. I mean pretty much the whole cast of characters are incredibly dynamic, they change over the course of the show, learn, grow with the viewer. Even characters like the homeroom teacher and class president who don't get anywhere near as much screen time as most of the cast really do learn and evolve into better people. The character interactions are quite amazing and beautifully woven together to really show how the characters grow from each other. Nothing feels forced or nonsensical; every characters actions and emotions feels very real and relatable. For such a simple story, it really is fleshed out marvelously by these extremely dynamic characters, and really makes the viewer feel at home and engaged from beginning to end.\\n\\n\r\nToradora is definitely a show that met my expectations and I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in the genre it tops at. Extremely lovable and relatable characters that make a basic story turn into a highly enjoyable experience from beginning to end will make you wish the show doesn't end when it does. It's a show that more likely than not will grow on me as time goes on, maybe becoming my favorite anime of all time.",

            "content": "Keeping a story interesting through a 25 episode series is a hard thing to do and you must always make sure that your not too repetitive with the stories. This anime does a great job in doing this and i never thought I'd enjoy it. I first saw this anime on a top 10 romance video and it took me 6 months to actually get around to it because i don't like romance between a short and a tall character. Before i watched the anime i didn't even have an open mind, i was 75% sure i was going to hate it and i havegot to say that this anime was unexpectedly enjoyable. I loved the concept of the tiger and the dragon and how they were the perfect match for each other. I just loved both of their relationship throughout the series. Every time their friends would face a conflict and i was interested in almost all of their stories. I also liked how unique of a male character Ryuuji was. Some of Ryuuji's qualities were adapted from other regular main characters but most of them were quite unique. This might sound great and all but their was a bit of failure when it came to Ami's character. Ami caught my attention at first but after a while her story kinda grew old and she never really solved her problem. I never even understood what she was thinking. Her character was confusing and it hurt my head a little. The next issue is more of a personal taste rather than an issue. Tragic romance has always made me cry and i never really had a problem with it but the ending was really something i didn't get. Yeah i get that love is confusing and all but if Tiga's Decision still baffles me to this moment. If she had died or was forced to move i would have understood but her decision was like taking a poo on all the build up and hard work. Over all i think that this anime was very good and i hope that it was definitely a must watch anime",

I thought there would be more romance in this anime but there wasn't any romance until the last few episodes. I was disappointed that there wansn't much romance. I still enjoyed the anime though but it's not one of my favorites.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nI liked the whole idea of two people trying to help each other get with the one they love or have a crush on but than instead fallingfor each other. But the anime would get boring at certain points. But i did like how they mixed comedy and drama together. I give it a 7/10 though because like I said it was just to boring for me at certain times.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nI really loved the art and I loved all the bright colors in the anime. The art would look weird sometimes though. Now I'm not going to say why because it would be a spoiler. But I really did like the art.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\r\nI think this is referring to music? Well If it is... I loved the soundtrack. Especially when a sad scene would come on there would be that touching music that would make you cry. I almost cried as a matter of fact while that music was on. I didn't really like one or two background pieces though.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\r\nThe characters were amazing! My favorite character was definitely Taiga. She's the best character in the show in my opinion. All of the other characters were great to though and I instantly fell in love with them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:7/10\\n\r\nAs I said before the anime would get boring I'm certain episodes. But there were some episodes that had me hooked and I had to watch the next episode after watching certain ones\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nThe anime was good overall. The only reason I gave it a 7/10 is because there wasn't much romance and it would get boring at creating points. Anyway that's my review.\\n",

            "content": "Review in brief:  Toradora! is full of the usual high-school rom-com tropes and clich\u00e9s, yet it not only succeeds but excels at nearly everything it works towards.  It doesn\u2019t contain those tropes just because they\u2019re standard; it knows how & why they were meant to be used in the first place and uses them to their fullest.  By tying them together with a strong central theme, Toradora! becomes an excellent journey crafted out of familiar story elements.\r\nReview in full:  The premise of Toradora! is simple; it\u2019s a high school rom-com in which the main characters are trying to hook each otherup with their best friends, as they each happen to have crushes on the other's friend.  It\u2019s a premise that surprises nobody, and it doesn\u2019t take much thought to correctly guess how things will end up.  If you don\u2019t know who the main characters end up with by the end of episode 2 then you simply had to have missed something.  At this point Toradora! may sound like a waste of time, but that would be deciding that a cake tastes bad based only on its shape.  The \u201cmain romance\u201d elements are basically given to the audience from the get-go because they are only a setup for the real goal of Toradora!, and that is to cultivate a character drama around the concept of self-honesty within the artificial world we know as \u201chigh-school\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nIt starts with the characters, both main & side. On the surface they are quite tropey and in many ways just what you\u2019d expect out of this genre of anime. In this way they also tend to have exaggerated physical and emotional features, emphasizing their feelings and antics towards the other characters. However, in time it is shown that these \u201ctypical\u201d behaviors are, much like the rest of high school society, a fa\u00e7ade, within which vulnerable teenage self-identities hide in fear and feared personas are cast into by those less caring. These characters aren\u2019t the standard templates they initially appear to be; they are actually defined by their thought processes and emotional reaction points. This refreshing form of characterization is the path that allows what at first is just a typical rom-com cast to grow into the central theme of self-honesty. It\u2019s why the exaggerative covers are there in the first place; the slew of templated, cutout characters in anime\u2019s ubiquitous high-school setting can easily give us viewers the depressing expectation that they\u2019re almost all cover and no book.\\n\\n\r\nToradora! also makes great use of its generic setting and story arcs therein.  It proudly features the anime-school staples: festivals, P.E. swimming, the beachside summer house, and a field trip so blatantly opposite to the norm that it\u2019s a joke.  Unlike lesser school anime that merely use these to run their characters through the typical thematic jokes and leave it at that (\u201cIt\u2019s high-school, surely you didn\u2019t expect something different!\u201d) Toradora! makes a point of using each situation to allow its characters to bond through necessitated teamwork, enter environments where they\u2019re more willing to peel back their fronts a little, and create moments that snowball over the course of the show to become dramatic scenarios of their own later on.\\n\\n\r\nBecause of this, no matter how predictable or generic the main story elements get, Toradora! is always able to deliver a dramatic experience, witty comedy, or even both at the same time via multi-layered character-driven interactions.  My only real complaint is that Kitamura's arc could have been handled better in regards to Kitamura's character and development feeling a little lacking up to that point, but it's nothing too serious and builds the setup for the rest of the show.\\n\\n\r\nToradora! is also doubly entertaining, allowing it to appeal to a wide range of expectations.  Firstly, its pace is maintained via arcs of 2-3 episodes, long enough to make each arc matter without dragging any scenarios or plot elements out longer than necessary.  Secondly, it possesses a decidedly silly flavor of humor.  Most of Toradora!\u2019s comedy doesn't derive from situations or misunderstandings between characters (as one would expect from the genre) but most often just the characters goofing around and having a good time, especially where the outwardly enthusiastic characters are involved.  Not that those other forms of comedy can\u2019t be effective (otherwise one would think that they\u2019d be far less common) but Toradora!\u2019s comedy is innately refreshing.  By allowing the characters to simply act as they are within these silly moments instead of following a rigid joke scenario it fosters an air of genuineness that gives the whole show a special charm and occasionally even sees characters develop through comedy.\\n\\n\r\nEven the production values of Toradora! end up amounting to more than they initially appear.  With its clear and effective use of both color palettes and emotive animation to reflect each scene\u2019s mood, the visual artistry does everything it needs to do  to make the end result shine.  Of particular note are the dramatic sequences with highly controlled frame-rates, emulating a live-action movie to great effect.  The sound (especially the voice acting) is just about a perfect match, with distinct and lively voice acting for nearly every character and catchy music that captures the mood from a high schooler\u2019s mind noticeably well.\\n\\n\r\nNow it must be said that many people who dislike the show cite a disdain for Taiga's violent and reactive character.  If you don't like her it will likely detract from your enjoyment.  For me, having known people who were surprisingly similar was enough to accept her when she wasn't likable and led to her growing on me over time, which seems to have been the author\u2019s intention.  I can say with confidence that Taiga's character is exaggerated to the same degree as the other main characters and didn't come off as comically strange or unnatural to me like other violent tsun-type characters tend to.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict:  On the surface, Toradora! is a generic high-school rom-com with a standard premise and a clich\u00e9 & predictable outcome.  Dig deeper and it discards those notions when it turns out to be an intricately developed character drama, complete with moments both tender and lighthearted.  It shows us that something doesn't have to be one-of-a-kind to be truly beautiful, special, or even unique.  At the end of the day the journey can mean as much as or even more than the destination it leads to.  That is Toradora! ~ a whimsical adventure in a familiar neighborhood.\\n\\n\r\nSide note:  This review, in part, was made to present the topics discussed in the MAL blog article \u201cToradora: Maturity and clich\u00e9\u201d by Awesomecake with spoiler-free wording.  If you\u2019ve already seen Toradora! and want to know more about its underlying themes I highly recommend giving her article a read.\\n\\n\r\nLink: https://myanimelist.net/blog.php?eid=769730",

            "content": "\"The greatest love story ever told.\" is the sentence that I always see being used to describe Toradora, is it truly?\r\nTo find out, I recently decided to rewatch this show that I've already finished a decent amount of time ago, and even though I already immensely enjoyed it the first time I watched it, surprisingly enough I loved it even more as a second time viewer. I genuinely and desperately didn't want it to end, yet I couldn't stop watching every single episode back to back. Maybe that comment wasn't for nothing after all.\r\nToradora follows Ryuuji, who is a gentle guy but has an intimidatingface that makes people afraid of him, labeling him as a delinquent. Taiga is the Palm-top Tiger of the school, a little but vicious girl who IS actually the violent character here. These two are in love with each other's bestfriends, so they decide to help each other out to win the affections of the ones they love, hilarity ensues.\\n\r\n Now if you have ever seen a love story, you know damn well that Ryuuji and Taiga will end up with each other instead, and the show doesn't act as if it's a grand reveal either, so it's the way the show builds up this premise that makes it so damn enjoyable. The anime does a great job to come up with scenarios where drama could take place too and execute it beautifully.\\n\\n\r\nThe artstyle while not the most unique still looks great. I'm especially fond of Ryuuji and Taiga's character deisgns. they're simple yet very iconic. The rest of the cast kinda pale in comparison to our two leads in terms of design, but they still have interesting if not likeable outer appearances.\\n\r\n The show has beautiful backdrops that sell it's strong atmosphere. The cinematography is great, there is a nice sense of reality to the world. When Ryuuji is at the christmas party and Taiga is holed up in her home, the show does a great job to make you feel the long distance between them. It builds up it's atmosphere and convey the feelings of it's characters through it's visuals just like how a good picture should and it's absolutely great.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't particularly care for the opening or ending themes (the first op was much better than the second though) but the show has a great soundtrack that accompany it's emotional moments. Especially the track \"Lost my pieces\" destroys my heart everytime I hear it, even after finishing the show. And it's obvious they were aware how good a song it was too, as it's used to great effect during emotional moments.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all well written even when they're not particularly likeable people. For example, I can say that I hated Ami with every fiber of my being, but I can't call her a poorly written character because she simply isn't. In fact compared to more blandly written characters like Kitamura, she has a lot more going on.\\n\r\nOf course the strongest characters of Toradora is Ryuuji and Taiga. Their journey as they learn about each other and also themselves is the main source of light that makes this show shine. \\n\\n\r\nToradora is a show that made me experience a wide range of emotions during it's run. And even though it has it's problems that I'm willing to acknowledge (like the ending that was kind of rushed and not completely satisfying), I simply can't label this show as anything other than a must see, expecially if you're into romance and/or drama as a genre.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not a perfect anime, but there is no perfect anime, and because there is no such thing as a perfect anime that I can give Toradora the 10/10 rating it deserves. There's simply no other romance anime that compares to this. \\n\r\nYuuji and Taiga's journey is just too compelling.",

Most of the characters are well developed despite its 25 episode short length. \r\nIn short, if you're looking for something revolutionary or fresh, feelfree to skip Toradora but if you're willing to look past its common tropes, get ready for a captivating ride!",

            "content": "It is sad, and it is happy. Its funny, emotional, and romance is done beautifully. It portraits uncertainty of youth and love in very touching, but also entertaining way.\r\nI will not write about surface story. But about what is beneath that. It was story about love. It start with very naive picture of love, that kind that (~15)young people have. That you just see someone and you know that that is the person. Then it evolves throughout the first three fourts of series. It becomes story about self, self reflection, self sacrifice, happiness, future... Things that many self aware young people think about. Things thatI think about a lot. It develops both paths. Selfish/heart and more logical, but ironically selfless (You want good for more people that just you) path. We get taste of both of them, because every character has this internal struggle. The culmination of this was \"cession\" of \"Pink hair\" girl and then \"espace\" (heart) and \"seclusion\" (logick) of 2 MCs (\"petite\" and \"Long boi\"). These parts were very emotional, somehow sad but happy... simply just beautiful. It doesnt offer answers to your questions about love, of happiness ... but it beautifly depicts why and how you have them. Of course, storywise it had to end somehow. And it chooses the \"you must understand and accept yourself to be happy\" approach.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum it up: Great depiction of how meaning of love evolves, and how it gets complicated... Emotionally and allegorically beautiful. I really recommend to watch this after some harem ecchi anime to make yourself feel like human again.",

Perfect Plan! after this master plan failed he tried Awkwardly to stop her from going by Begging her in front of everyone in a ceremony! also failed Big Surprise!! and he breaks through intoThe MC's house! I mean what the hell is that!\\n\\n\r\nand of course the star of the show! Kushieda Minori\\n\r\nshe is the fakest person ever, she is fake to her friends she is fake to the audience and she is fake to herself! you can\u2019t understand what the hell is it she wants, she desperately tries to show herself happy but secretly she is sad, this sounds like a character you usually root for right? Dead Wrong, her happy moments are SOO fake that it takes away everything with it, if she would appear normal in public i could root for her, because if you haven\u2019t figured it out yet i love normal behaving people!\\n\\n\r\nthe comedy is really bad, Taiga hitting Takasu and calling him a Dog was funny the first couple of times then it's kinda... well not funny anymore\\n\r\nanother problem is that Everyone is a Drama Queen! and confessions are so cheesy I wanna die! (except for Taiga and Takasu)\\n\\n\r\nnow let's take a look at Takasu, the main character:\\n\r\nyou know people are usually looking for smart ways to get people to do their work for them, so they study psychology and shit to manipulate others, guess how Taiga Manipulates Takasu to make her works, clean her room, buy her stuff and cook for her? NO take a wild guess!\\n\r\nThat's right! she calls him a dog and treats him like one WAIT she doesn't! Because you usually don't hit a dog! and yet he kept being with her, Poor Ami, she was right to call him a Baka! the funniest part is in one episode he concludes that it was HER who were near her all this time! i swear i\u2019m losing it!!! BAKA! she is only around you because YOU are chasing her around!\\n\r\nand I don't think he understand that his mother is a prostitute otherwise he wouldn't be so indifferent about it!\\n\\n\r\n*Spoilers\\n\r\nand of course the ending, they really tried to make us worry in episode 25 but we all knew it was bullshit and there is gonna be a happy ending, so Taiga suddenly choosing to transfer herself -(even though a day ago she was ready to leave everything and everyone behind)- didn't make any sense and just turned this anime more crappy\\n\r\n*Spoilers\\n\\n\r\noh in case I didn't mention there is a creepy seizure disordered bird! that was not cute at all, I don't know why it is there do begin with, it's like the joke is writing itself!\\n\\n\\n\r\nthis is a long anime to be honest, I was watching it with 1.5x speed from episode 15 forward!\\n\\n\r\nin conclusion, if you are not a huge fan of romance maybe this anime isn't the best choice right now save it for later.",

            "content": "TORADORA REVIEW\r\nToradora is a romantic comedy drama series. The story centres round Taiga Aisaka and Ry\u016bji Takasu as they pursue their love interests, which just happen to be each others best friend. Ry\u016bji helps look after Taiga, taking on the role of her absent father. Throughout the series he tries to tame the Palmtop Tiger(Taiga's nickname) whilst attempting to set her up with his best friend Y\u016bsaku Kitamura. Taiga tries to help Ry\u016bji overcome his shyness to Minori Kushieda. She initially treats Ry\u016bji like her 'dog' and constantly demands he obey her. But as the series continues she begins to rely as Ry\u016bji as botha fatherly figure and a friend. The series tells a very refreshing tale that true love is always closer than you think. I loved the art style, it was simplistic and bright but didn't come across as generic as most of the art styles that make up this highly popular genre. The 4 Opening and Endings where top notch too however I must say the second opening didn't pull me in as well as the previous one. The characters are a stand  out. It has quite a small cast for this genre of anime. But it soon proves you don't always need a huge cast *Lucky Star, cough*. The main protagonists are so different in contrast other rom/com anime but they manage to pull it off in a remarkably, refreshing fashion.  They are very well developed and you will(unless you're dead inside) get very attached to them. Taiga is one of the strongest female leads in an anime. She can have you in tears of joy and laughter but she can drag you into tears of sadness and pity in the blink of an eye. There is one scene in particular had me in a 'awww she's so cute,' mood but i suddenly felt so sad and sorry for her very quickly. Ryuji like Taiga is very well developed. He is a very caring and gentle character. As the main lead he is very good but does lack a but of personality. But the relationship he maintains throughout the series to both Taiga and his often tipsy single mom Yasuko Takasu, as the role of the father is a emotional and often heartbreaking one. This is by far the strongest aspect of the series. The love interests Kitamura and Minori are very likeable too. Kitamura is a strong and selfless character. He suffers from Ryuji's case of a slight lack of personality but he plays the role of the popular classmate well. Minori is far stronger as a side character. She is an extremely deep and complex character and it will take you right up until the end to fully understand her true feelings and personality. She is the highest point of comedy and WTF? moments in the series but pulls it off brilliantly without coming off cheesy and lame. Ami Kawashima is the fifth and final main character. She is a model and a childhood friend of Kitamura. She initially appears to fit the spoilt, man eating tag well. But as the story progresses, much like the rest of the cast her personality evens out and she becomes much more likeable and down to earth. And this is what the series nails completely: CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT. Bleach and Naruto need to take note on this extremely well developed small cast of characters. The story was at the outset easy to predict but it begins to throw you off course and builds to the point where you are so caught up in it you won't realise it's over until it's over. That for me was my smallest complaint. The final arc seems to stumble under the enormous emotional build-up. It pulls it off very well but it felt a tiny bit rushed. However I loved the ending, one of the most satisfying anime endings you will ever find.\\n\\n\r\nVERDICT\\n\r\nProbably the best romantic comedy anime I have ever seen. Great characters, great story. The emotional depth and build-up is of the highest order. Just a fabulous anime. I foolishly dropped round episode 3. BUT STICK WITH IT!!!! Around episode 6 you'll be pulled into the dramatic story. So please watch it and enjoy the well crafted plot and wonderful cast of interesting characters.\\n",

The characters are all very unique to the show. None of them really act similar to one another, each has their own personality. This was very refreshing! The series is pretty good although somewhere towards the end, it felt a little drawn out and  fatigued.  It did pick up though and ended up being a really good anime. I think that it is worth looking into despite this problem.",

            "content": "[Story: 8.0] Toradora is, dare I say, undisputedly one of the most popular series of 2008. And it's not hard to see why, provided one watches past the initial episodes of misunderstandings, love triangles and such, that is. Because although Toradora began with plenty of elements common in its genre, it ended off as more than just a typical romance comedy. The series isn't just about romance, as it deals with relationships not limited to the typical love scenarios and gimmicks prevalent in most school-life shows. There isn't much to really comment on the story, as the plot itself is rather straightforward and simplistic.\r\nI personallyalso like the use of a bookend (or framing device), such as how the way the show started mirrors how it concluded; it may be a minor thing, but it does contribute to the overall feel of the series, in that it helped in creating the mood of a finale with proper resolutions. And it's an excellent resolution as well and I like the dialogue being echoed at the end - if there\u2019s anything I've got to complain, it would be that I didn't get the ending that I wanted. I was shipping Ryuuji and Minorin (despite the very obvious series title).\\n\\n\r\n[Characters: 9.0] What's enthralling about Toradora is none other than its cast, each of who has their own distinct personalities that are well explored during the course of the series. Without a doubt, the cast is astonishing, growing (and shedding) past their archetypes and are shown as individuals with depth. For a start, there's Minorin: beneath the eccentric and ever-energetic persona, is a girl with a surprisingly complex emotion and disposition - something one doesn't usually associate with the genki girl archetype. Similarly, despite the initial setting of Ami being the school idol with a snarky attitude, she was gradually portrayed as not only sympathetic, but can be quite a good friend as well. Even Kitamura has his own share of drama to deal with, showing that indeed, being the vice-president of the student council and class representative isn\u2019t a ticket to being infallible after all (breaking quite a few anime conventions in the process).\\n\\n\r\nMost notable of course, is none other than the titular pair of protagonists. Ryuuji, being a nice guy deep down, whose main quirk is being someone with an obsession for cleaning and housework in general, creates an interesting contrast with Taiga's brash and clumsy actions. Some of the interactions those two had in the later part of the series can be both poignant and heartwarming. Overall, their actions and how they open up to their friends are what determined the dynamics of the show.\\n\\n\r\n[Art: 9.0] Toradora, despite being a romance comedy, actually had better animation quality than a certain Fantasy series also made by JC Staff and released also in the same year. Now that's saying a lot for both shows. As a compliment to the studio, Toradora's art quality is fantastic. Apart from the great character designs, much effort is evident in things such as the subtle twitch in facial expressions, the gestures and fluid movements, which are all very well done. These are made all the more pertinent in the later part of the series when it\u2019s more drama-heavy, thus aids in amplifying the mood of the series. For example, refer to the scene between Taiga and Sumire - that alone is a testament to the studio\u2019s success.\\n\\n\r\n[Music: 9.0] The theme songs are all fantastic, with the two OPs, Pre-Parade and Silky Heart being very catchy and addictive, making good use of not just their voice-acting skills, but also as singers. The bgm isn't anything impressive, but they suit the series just as well and the choice of tracks is fine too.\\n\\n\r\n[Summary] With a cast of endearing characters and a nice blend of humor and drama, Toradora is certainly entertaining and worthy of its hype. It may not offer anything new to the genre, but it does it well. High re-watch value, too.\\n\r\nPersonal Overall Rating: 9.0\\n",

However, it picks up at later episodes and if you can endure up to then, it is well worth the watch. \r\nArt: 8\r\nI was sceptical at first at the way the characters looked which was something I was not used to. However, after a couple of episodes, you really do get use to it and it becomes enjoyable to watch. It has good details and is worth thewatch.\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nLike your typical anime, the voice acting and sounds were spot on and well expressed with emotions that will move you.\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nMany people dislike the character of Taiga for her abusiveness towards our beloved Ryuuji as well as most characters in the series, but personally I loved her character. The relationship between Taiga and Ryuuji felt real and the series does well in showing the viewer their relationship throughout even when you're told otherwise. Minor characters which seem to only be there for the sake of it eventually comes into the picture and we suddenly notice them as having a role in the series rather than just another mise en scene. The characters are funny in their own way and provide the viewers with laughter at certain point which is a bonus in my book.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nHaving waited almost the entire series for the characters to finally express themselves, it felt a bit abrupt in the way the series ending. I personally think that the ending could've being more satisfying if they had showed a bit of the after story. But nonetheless, it was enjoyable.\\n\r\nOVERALL: 8\\n\r\nI would definitely recommend this anime to those hardcore high school romance fans because it takes a little endurance to get through. But it is definitely rewarding. I often say a good anime is any anime that can still evoke emotions in you after you have long watched it because it shows that it has impacted you in some way and you have taken something from it.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR : Definitely recommend to romance series lovers. The plot is a little slow but it is rewarding to finish. Characters are easy to relate to and provide much needed humour and emotions. Watch it!",

The more serious, revealing moments were not very well-explained, either, forcing the viewer to fill in various blanks with assumptions at best.\r\nThe series had a lot of potential and a great concept, but it was simply not straightforward enough, making it both an enjoyable yet frustrating watch.",

Although, all have those specific unique aspects, that other don't.\r\nAt first, watching first episode, I was about like \"I've seen similar somewhere. I'm quite sorry for Ruuji, must hurt\" and so on. Basicaly, It just didn't grab me.\r\nAs I was watching further, the character development actually grabbed me a lot. You see, the facial expresions for every moment, word, are pretty accurate. As well as we don't get those big faces with extra eyes for special expression, which makes it quite pretty more realistic. After all, words ain'teverything, actions speak louder.\\n\\n\r\nWe see how characters develop in rather a bit unexpected way. All of the characters we see there bump into specific troubles and we slowly find out who they really are, showing you that first impression isn't really everything.\\n\\n\r\nI myself honestly like a lot all the opening themes. First one being quite energetic, second rather more serious, but still, it fits the story well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter voicing was quite awesomely done, I was all grabbed in, looking for all expressions, tone of voice everywhere and I just enjoyed it a lot.\\n\\n\r\nI agree with previous previews, it has flaws, nothing's perfect. But, this is a rather unique romance anime, that I don't mind rewatching and definitely recommend to everybody that likes romance and wants to understand emotions better, after all, there's some true knowledge in it, that helps in real life.\\n\\n\r\nOverall rating 10/10, because it gave me a lot of precious knowledge, enjoyment, emotional understanding and a way how to use my free time =)",

            "content": "I came into Toradora! excited. I heard so much hype for it over the years and I\u2019m a huge fan of tsundere characters of which Taiga is the poster child. So, why not? \r\nHowever, from the very first episode I could tell: Toradora! isn\u2019t really anything special. Perhaps the series was groundbreaking when it was first released, but I failed to see what was so amazing about it. Sure, I had a few chuckles here and there, and certain scenes (ski-trip incident, Taiga\u2019s mental breakdown about losing Ryuuji, and a few others) were pretty great, but I definitely wouldn\u2019t consider this anime a masterpiece. \r\nNow,I may sound like I\u2019m just trash-talking this series, but there were some pretty decent points, too. I\u2019ll go through each category one by one and explain both the positives and negatives I found.\\n\\n\r\nStory: \\n\\n\r\n5.5/10 \u2014 Ryuuji Takasu, a 2nd year high-school student who is often feared for his scary-looking face, meets Taiga Aisaka\u2014 the school\u2019s most feared girl. After discovering that Taiga has a crush on his best friend (Kitamura) and that he has a crush on hers (Minori), the two join forces in an attempt to play matchmaker for one another. The story follows their attempts at getting their friends to fall for each other, but in the end, it\u2019s Ryuuji and Taiga that end up getting together. \\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s face it, Toradora! had a very basic storyline. While I admit the plot of having the MCs play matchmaker was new, the majority of Toradora! was your basic slice-of-life/high school storyline. I enjoyed the class trip, the pool \u201carc\u201d and other typical high school activities since I\u2019m a fan of the slice of life genre, but what bothered me was the overall pacing of the story. There were far too many episodes and not enough entertaining content to fill them. Certain problems were drawn out unnecessarily (i.e.: Ryuuji trying to confess to Minori) that dampened the show to boring at times. Other times (particularly the first episode) the scenes cut through quickly and weren\u2019t even given proper conclusions. One example of this was in the first half of episode 1 when Ryuuji literally bumps into Taiga for the first time. Taking offense, Taiga punches him. \\n\\n\r\n\u2026And that\u2019s it. \\n\\n\r\nRyuuji moves on as if getting punched in the face is an everyday occurrence. It doesn\u2019t show him angered, saddened, even bothered by the fact that he got socked in the face for no apparent reason by a stranger. He just rolls with it, because, hey, why not? On top of that, the next time he meets with her, he has nothing to say about being punched. He doesn\u2019t confront her or complain about it. He has no reaction; he just moves on. Normal humans don't do that. \\n\\n\r\nSkipping ahead, I also find it worthy to add my feelings about Ryuuji and Taiga as a couple. Though I understand the build-up for Taiga's feelings toward Ryuuji, I can't quite understand why Ryuuji liked Taiga in return. The anime made it seem as if, once he figured out Taiga had feelings for him, he decided to like her, too, just because. Taiga falling in love with Ryuuji made sense because he was a generally kind person that helped her through thick and thin. In fact, the majority of the series is spent with Ryuuji trying to help Taiga win Kitamura over. Ryuuji, on the other hand, didn't have the same luxury from Taiga. There were only about a handful of scenes where Taiga honestly tried to help Ryuuji get together with Minori. This, in the end, made Ryuuji's love feel forced, considering that he didn't really have any reason to like Taiga. Instead, it seemed as if he just got used to her being around. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\n8/10 \u2014 Definitely strong and entertaining, this is probably where Toradora! shone the brightest. I found Minori and Ami the strongest of all the cast with special emphasis on the former. Though Minori was presented as an oddball character, she succeeded where other whacky anime characters fail\u2013 she had substance. There was meaning behind her odd behavior and even slight hints at a deeper layer that I wish could have been explored more. Ami, though depicted as a spoiled, self-absorbed girl, seemed to undergo an entertaining personality change that was subtle enough to be believable and flawlessly executed. Kitamura, though a kind and chuckle-worthy character wasn\u2019t particularly notable, and the same can be said (but to a lesser degree) about Taiga and Ryuuji\u2014 the main characters. Ryuuji is another likable character that makes you root for him, though nothing about him particularly stands out. He\u2019s introduced as a character that scares most of his peers due to his fearsome appearance, but this detail was barely touched upon. In the end, I felt Ryuuji was a flat character\u2014 kind, a little snarky at times, and a cleaning-fanatic, but hardly worthy of becoming anybody\u2019s favorite character. As for Taiga, I personally liked her quick tongue when it came to battling Ami\u2019s jeers and her dynamically fearless spirit, though, at times her attitude was a little annoying. There were also times where I was a bit confused because her actions clashed with her personality. For example, though she and Ami seemed to fight and bicker constantly, they decide (without any build-up) to sing a cheerful and festive Christmas song together on stage at a class party because\u2026 why not? Perhaps there was a love-hate relationship that built overtime between the two, but I didn\u2019t feel as if it was executed in a subtle yet comprehendible way. \\n\\n\r\nAll and all, everyone was fairly likable and pulled off the series very nicely.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt / Sound: \\n\\n\r\n5.5/10 \u2014 I don\u2019t have much to say about the art and sound since I don\u2019t often focus a whole lot of time on them with anime. But for the sake of the review, I\u2019ll leave my two cents. The art is decent. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s particularly beautiful, but it wasn\u2019t bad, either. It gets the job done. As for the sound, I felt the first opening didn\u2019t really fit the show. It wasn\u2019t because it was a bad song, but I just felt that its techno-y sound clashed with the series\u2019 genre. As for the other songs, I admit that I didn\u2019t give them much of a listen with the exception of the second ending, \u201cOrange\u201d (a song that I rather enjoyed and found very catchy). \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of the voices, everyone did a decent job and I have no real complaints about it. The only exception to this is Taiga who was voiced by Rie Kugimiya in the Japanese version. Having watched Gintama (another anime where Kugimiya plays the main female heroine \u2018Kagura\u2019) before Toradora! I kept getting a \u201cKagura\u201d vibe. There were times when she sounded decent for Taiga, but when her pitch changed, I just kept picturing Kagura. Kagura has such a vastly different personality from Taiga\u2019s, so to keep picturing her, I couldn\u2019t help but feel a bit irritated. This is just my personal opinion and I\u2019m simply including this tidbit because it did have an affect on my enjoyment. Her voice, to me, just didn\u2019t feel right at some points.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Conclusion: \\n\\n\r\n7/10 \u2014 Toradora! is a decent anime if you want to pass the time. It does have its excellent points as well as its weak ones. I found myself bored by a few of the center episodes, but the anime as a whole is marathon-able. If I had to give it a grade, it would get a B-. I\u2019m honestly a little confused as to why this anime is hyped about and given as much praise as it has received over the years.  However, I\u2019m not above recommending it to anyone that wants a satisfactory romance story with great slice of life elements.",

First off, the show is absolutely amazing. No doubt about it.I enjoyed almost every bit of it. I would recommend it to everyone.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726\u2726\\n\\n\r\nSynopsis : - \\n\\n\r\n\"Despite Ryuji Takasu's gentle personality, his eyes make him look like an intimidating delinquent. Class rearrangements on his second high school year put him together with his best friend, Yusaku Kitamura, and his hidden crush, Minori Kushieda. Along with these two comes Kushieda's best friend, Taiga Aisaka. Her delicate appearance contrasts with her brutal personality. Secretly in love with Kitamura, Taiga agrees to help Ryuji with his love interest as long as he helps her get closer to hers.\\n\r\n\" \\n\\n\r\n\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\\n\\n\r\nStory : - The story in Toradora isn't the most important aspect, as it heavily relies on the characters rather than the actual story. Think of the story as a 'base foundation', and the characters - the glue that are holding it all together. Of course, there's a background, there's a beginning, middle and end, but again - not all that important. I do like how the story unfolds, peeling off layer by layer of all the characters. Diving deeper into their personalities. More on this later. But overall, Tordaora's story does not have any major plot twists, (except the ending. More on this later.) it is simple as it should be. And it works, very, very well. \\n\\n\r\n\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\\n\\n\r\nArt / Animation : - Toradora's visual style is decent. There are moments when it deviates from the way they've been animating things, there are a few intense scenes that essentially require the deviation, but all in all, it's solid. Good to look at. Characters seem believable, environments are pretty nice.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\\n\\n\r\nSound : - For the most part, Toradora's soundtrack is very generic. There's nothing special about it. Sure, it suits the mood for the most part. The up-beat 'comic' scenes are complemented nicely thanks to the well-fitting OST. But that's all. HOWEVER. There's one track that I absolutely adore. It is played at the best moments possible and I might even go as far as to say it's one of the best I've ever heard. \"Lost My Pieces\". I must also mention the EXCELLENT voice-acting for Taiga in the subbed version. The voice-actress must be really talented. I consider Taiga the epitome of Tsundere. Because till now, I haven't seen a more perfect version of the Tsundere definition I had in my mind. And the actress pulls it off brilliantly. That being said, the English dub is also quite amazing. I had the dual audio version so I was able to hear them both. Oh also, amazing OP1. Decent OP2. ( I was sad when they changed it and it wasn't as good as OP1 ;_; ) and ABSOLUTELY FAKIN BEAUTIFUL ED2.\\n\r\nORENJIIIIIIIIIIIII\\n\\n\r\n\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\\n\\n\r\nCharacters : - Ah, yes. The BEST part of Toradora. The characters. Takasu Ryuuji, imo, is a very basic 'template' character. Yes, he's interesting enough for me to care about him, but the real star of the show is Taiga. No two ways about it. Taiga simply steals the stage. She's the main focus almost all the time. It's because of her that most of the scenes are hilarious / and / or ( at times ) worth watching. Her personality is that of a typical ( but imo, the BEST ) Tsundere. Taiga's at her best by end of the first half. That is basically the definition of the Palmtop Tiger. ( her nickname. ) But this also means that people who heavily dislike Taiga might not enjoy the show. Because it mostly revolves around her. That being said, the side characters are also seen undergoing a LOT, and I mean a LOT of character development. Well. It's more of *learning* about these characters rather than them actually 'developing', but it's extremely entertaining nonetheless. Entertaining. Enjoyable. That's what Toradora is. Mostly because of its characters. Trust me, if you like the characters in this anime, ( say, after watching the first few episodes or so. ) you will absolutely love it. From Yuusaku Kitamura, Kushieda Minori, Kawashima Ami, to, heck, even Haruta and Noto and the teacher with the unmarried-face, everyone has at least one aspect to them that makes them unique and just a joy to..well, watch. \\n\\n\r\n\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\\n\\n\r\nRomance : - The romance between the two doesn't develop early. It builds up till the 3/4th section of the anime and then finally explodes. Trust me, the journey is FUN. The small teases / hints of them inevitably getting together also helps. The way they help each other and over time fall for each other, is really entertaining to watch.  Overall, just an amazing romance. \\n\\n\r\nI definitely recommend Toradora to EVERYONE. Despite its somewhat disappointing ending, ( varies from person to person ), in the end, you'll be glad you watched it. Trust me.\\n\\n\r\n   OVERALL  :\\n\r\n8/10, a very good anime.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\u2726\\n\r\n.... The 3/4th section and beyond  : - *SPOILERS!!!!!!!*\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n>\\n\r\n>\\n\r\n>\\n\r\n>\\n\r\n>\\n\r\n>\\n\r\n>\\n\r\n>\\n\r\n>\\n\r\n>\\n\r\n>\\n\r\n>\\n\r\n>\\n\r\n>\\n\r\nThis section changed almost everything. The characters were now showing their true sides or their true colors, or simply developing due to being in certain scenarios. I.E Minori, she was supposed to be the 'good' or the 'cheerful' girl of the bunch. But she ended up being a rather intense and somewhat angry, lonely girl by the end. The drama. Yes. I know a lot of people here DISLIKED the drama, but for me, I didn't dislike it. I didn't LOVE it either. I was okay with whatever direction the show was taking, because it was still interesting and entertaining. It didn't \"wow\" me. It didn't make me cry. In fact, there are very few moments by the end that actually made me 'feel', because of the fact that they overdid themselves in the -drama- area. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending wasn't necessarily bad, but it was just something I wasn't expecting. I was confused. I didn't like the ending much at all. But that's not to say I hate the entire show for it. If anything, the previously mentioned \"different direction of the characters\" made me lower the score even further rather than the ending itself. It's all personal preference I guess. The ending was weird af, true. But I'm glad I watched this show. \\n",

            "content": "Toradora is a nice anime to watch, albeit it's probably not something I'd watch twice. The story isn't that complex, something which you'd expect from a slice-of-life anime. But at the same time, that can probably be a good thing -- what the characters go through are so realistic that anybody can probably relate to them. And, although the art has the ability to make anyone look too young, it's very well done. The animation is so smooth that even just someone running around is already pretty enough to look at.\r\nIn my opinion, what made this anime really splendid is the characters. They all havetheir faults, but it's just too difficult to hate any of them. For example, Kawashima Ami is shown to have such a deceitful personality, and she likes to interfere. If she were your classmate in real life, she'd be the 'bitch'. However, in Toradora, watching her peel off her layers and realize why she does these things makes you actually sympathize, if not like her. And, just like Kawashima, there always comes a time where you will sympathize with all the other main characters and love them, if you didn't already.\\n\\n\r\nThe interactions between the characters are what makes this anime enjoyable. Dramatic and comedic scenes are just as enjoyable, and nothing was overdone. All in all, I think people who will enjoy this show will be people who are looking for a light-hearted slice-of-life anime with just the right balance of comedy and drama.",

            "content": "I usually don't take the time to review the shows I've watched. However, after watching Toradora! a second time and still enjoying every second of it, I felt compelled to give my thoughts on this wonderful anime in hopes that I might convince others to view one of my favorite shows.\r\nN.B.: While I have tried not to include major spoilers in this review, I cannot promise that there are none, and there are certainly minor hints at the plot throughout. So, read on if you trust me to have kept it free of major spoilers, and if not, just trust my scoring, and gowatch this show.\\n\\n\\n\r\nToradora! is a romantic comedy that provides plenty of each with a flawless balance of laughs and emotional, tear-jerking moments. The show follows high-schoolers Takasu Ryuuji and Aisaka Taiga as they help one another pursue their romantic goals. Along the way, the main characters and their friends make plenty of memories and discover their true inner feelings.  While perhaps somewhat predictable, the plot has plenty of twists and turns that will keep you entertained. The antics of the characters in their quests for love, belonging, and survival in high school truly made me laugh out loud, and the emotional scenes around the middle and through to the end made me glad to have a box of tissues next to me. Tackling motifs of not only romantic love but also the definition of family, Toradora! succeeds in making the viewer believe that even the problems of an individual high-school student can have incredible gravity in a young person's life. As far as the ending is concerned, it was quite satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this anime are a varied bunch and manage to be relatable while at the same time being over-the-top. Their motivations, while seeming straightforward, are generally complex and deeply emotionally rooted. The at-times eccentric behavior of the characters lets the viewer escape into a more colorful world than our own, and the characters never fail to be lovable.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation quality is very nice, and besides occasional awkward frames of facial expressions, I can think of few complaints. The sound, though, is worth raving about. The background music sets the mood perfectly and never gets old. The music for the emotional parts (\u201cLost My Pieces\u201d) was especially spectacular and memorable. The openings set the tone of the show well, with the shift in openings occurring perfectly at one of the show\u2019s great emotional shifts. The endings were cute and fitting, and truth-be-told I can't get any of the openings or endings out of my head (nor do I want to).\\n\\n\r\nAs far as complaints go, I have but a few. As mentioned earlier, the story is sometimes a bit predictable, though I really believe that I'm feeling this mostly in retrospect as the ending was by no means solidly in my mind throughout the series. Besides this complaint, the characters are often quite ambiguous when discussing their feelings and details about the various romantic situation. This ambiguity made for times when I would feel lost trying to interpret the characters\u2019 words, and ultimately frustrated until explicit explanation was provided, if it even was. Also, on a very personal note, I felt dissatisfied about the end for a certain character (my favorite as it was).\\n\\n\r\nDespite a few complaints, this show was a near perfect romantic comedy anime and was incredibly enjoyable to watch and rewatch. The show is quite frankly adorable. My only caveat is that once you finish it, you'll almost certainly wish you had more Toradora! to enjoy.",

            "content": "This review contains minor spoilers.\r\nWhen I was in high school, I had a huge crush on a girl for years.  She was a talented singer with long red hair.  I was obsessed with this girl, and had put her on a high pedestal.  But I never really knew her very well; I had a hard time talking naturally with her, and our friendship, such as it was, was incredibly awkward.\r\nNeedless to say, my feelings were never reciprocated, and nothing ever happened with her.  \r\nThings were different with the girl I eventually married; we were close friends for years, and were comfortabletalking to each other about anything and everything, including crushes.  We spent tons of time together, talking to each other and just enjoying each other's company, and eventually that developed into real love, based on real trust and real companionship.\\n\\n\r\nThis is what Toradora captures so clearly.  The main characters, Taiga and Ryuuji, each have crushes on each other's best friend; upon discovering this, they embark on what quickly becomes a close and comfortable friendship, as each still pines after their unrequited crush.  What the show makes clear from the first episode, but they don't realize until much later, is that the person who matters most is already right in front of them.\\n\\n\r\nEach of the major characters in Toradora--not just Ryuuji and Taiga, but also their friends--are well-developed, with strengths and flaws and a clear thematic link between all of them relating to the way they handle hardship, which in each case is some variation of retreat, of refusing to face it head-on.\\n\\n\r\nIt's the characterization which makes this show very, very good.  Each character has a clearly demarcated story arc, and each has changed for the better by the time the series reaches its conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nNone of them illustrate this as clearly as Taiga, who at first glance seems like a stereotypical tsundere type, but who breaks the conventions of the trope in several key ways and by the end of the show behaves in ways which would make her almost unrecognizable if they happened in the first few episodes.  And yet her development is so judiciously meted out, and stems so much from her interactions with others and from decisions we see her make for herself, that it's fully believable when she becomes so much more mature by the show's ending.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters change too--not as dramatically, but in meaningful ways.  Because this isn't just a show about what it means to love somebody, it's also a coming-of-age story, and a very good one.\\n\\n\r\nToradora isn't perfect.  While the characterization is excellent, and the story is very good, sometimes the absurd and slapstick humor goes a little too far for my taste.  It's always tough to reconcile the entertainment factor with the serious elements of a romantic comedy like this; how seriously do you take Taiga basically beating the crap out of Ryuuji, for instance?  If it was live action, it'd be an abusive relationship--but it's an anime, and it's an expected trope and part of the show's sense of humor.\\n\\n\r\nThere might also be a touch of the Mary Sue going on with Ryuuji, with multiple girls all falling for him, despite that he's depicted as a bit of a nerdy homebody with odd interests.  My rule of thumb for avoiding that issue is that no more than two people should fall in love with the main character.  Any time a protagonist has 3+ people all crushing on him or her, I lose a little of my suspension of disbelief.  This is a minor problem with Toradora, but it is something which bugged me a bit.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is overall quite good, but the character designs I felt were just okay.  Taiga's \"palm-top tiger\" proportions are very exaggerated, and it makes her distinctive, but it also makes her look a little odd.  All of the female character designs felt a little bit weak to me, and notably Ami and the Student Council President look much too similar in silhouette and color choices.  I thought the artists did a better job with the guys, though Ryuuji and Kitamura look a bit too similar from behind.\\n\\n\r\nThe Japanese voice acting, though, is amazing, especially Taiga's, which stole the show.  The music ranges from serviceable to excellent, with one track, Lost My Pieces, being deservedly beloved by fans of the series.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the best things about this series is that it has a satisfying, mostly unambiguous ending.  The final epilogue section during the credits could've been expanded upon and been a little bit stronger, but overall, this isn't a series you'll leave with a bad taste in your mouth, unlike certain romance series I won't call out here by name.\\n\\n\r\nToradora is a hard show to rate for me, though, because there are things I disliked about it from the very first episode.  Most of those things are relatively minor, but they add up.  At the same time, there are aspects of it which I absolutely love, and I think it's possibly the best exploration of youthful love I've seen in an anime.\\n\\n\r\nSo I'd unabashedly recommend watching it, but I'd caution prospective viewers that there are some aspects which may bug you if you have the same sensitivities as I do--but at the same time I'll state that they're entirely worth pushing through to get to the meat of what's really a fantastic story with great characters.\\n\\n\r\nEight out of ten.",

This anime made me feel so many emotions that I thought my heart was going to melt out of my body and my soul would transcend to the next plane of existence. There were so many times in this anime that everything started to go properly and then bad again and flipping back and forth between good things and bad things and it was a huge emotional roller coaster. Overall the way that all the characters evolve and form relationships with one another is told in such a coherent and heartwarming way that I couldnot help but to give the story a perfect rating.\\n\\n\r\nArt [9/10]:\\n\r\nThe art wasn't too different from your traditional anime style but I did find it to be a very appealing part of Toradora. Although odd at first glance, there were many times when the art style simply popped out and was absolutely beautiful. An example of this is in the Christmas episodes, everything is so bright and lively and gives such a warm feeling to the audience and it is one of my favorite episodes in the whole series as well as a turning point. The animation style is smooth and has very eye grabbing moments when the scene begins to get intense.\\n\\n\r\nSound [10/10]:\\n\r\nEvery little tune in this anime assists its comedic and romantic nature perfectly. I loved the intro and the outro sequences throughout the entire anime and they always put me in a warm and fuzzy mood before the show starts. Sound isn't the best thing this anime has to offer but it is exceptionally well done.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter [10/10]:\\n\r\nEvery character is extremely unique and has great qualities about them, even the side characters like Yasuko. Pay close attention to all the subtle hints dropped from each person and pay attention to how their attitudes change toward one another. Watching the characters grow and develop in a realistic pacing is beautiful and truly what puts this anime apart from the others. Taiga, Takasu, Kitamura, Kawashima, and Kushieda make this anime shine as they evolve as characters and create nests within your heart as each of them unravel and show the best and worst sides of them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment [10/10]:\\n\r\nWhen I first began watching this anime, I had honestly expected nothing special. The episodes seemed bland and very standard, like something I had seen before. However, as the anime developed I realized that it was a unique experience, not just an anime, but as an experience in life. This show is romantic and funny, it is about friendship, family, and growth. I believe that everyone could find enjoyment from this anime, and might even be something that can be watched to get you introduced to anime if you have never seen anything before. I strongly recommend it and I am sure I will re-watch this series in the future because of how heartwarming it is.",

            "content": "I'm not the biggest fan of romantic comedy anime. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy them on occasion, but I never go OUT OF MY WAY to watch them when they come out, if you know what I mean. That being said, Toradora! is easily the best romcom anime ever made. At least in my opinion. Obviously it's subjective, but I freaking love this show, and I heartily recommend it to anyone who has yet to give it a watch.\r\nFor starters, it's one of the funniest shows I've ever seen, anime or otherwise. Sure, some of the humor leans a little towards the ecchi side,but most of the actual jokes in the show stem from the character's personalities and how they clash with eachother, so it feels organic. Plus, the characters ARE all teenagers, so whenever the show DOES make a joke that leans more towards the raunchy dirty side, it feels believable, because c'mon, they're in high school. Hormones be running wild, y'know? \\n\\n\r\nSecondly, the characters in this show are sooo relatable, and the main romance feels genuine due to the gradual progression. The heartfelt scenes between all of the characters and the way their friendships and feelings develop and evolve over time helps add to this feeling, and it also makes each of our main cast incredibly relatable because, essentially, you're growing along with them. I might be biased bc I watched this series around the time I was finishing up high school, but I found the story to be really relatable and I loved almost every character in the show. \\n\\n\r\nLastly, I feel like touching on the English dub-namely, it's quality. It's a lot better than fans of the show say it is. Now, I might be a little biased bc I didnt watch Toradora! until AFTER it had been dubbed so naturally, the dub was what I watched first, but I thought the VAs in the English version really gave it their all, and there isn't a single character who I would call \"miscast\". I've seen TONS of people hating on the dub online, and I'm honestly kinda baffled. Again, I'm probably biased bc I watched it dubbed first, or maybe they're biased bc they watched it in Japanese originally. That last one's definitely possible, I mean it originally aired in like what, 2008, and the dub didnt materialize until around 2014, so that's entirely plausible. Idk. Anyway, don't write off the dub is what I'm saying. If you prefer subs that's fine, I understand, but the dub is not awful like most other fans claim. Trust me, as someone who prefers dubs over subs, I have heard dubs that are a thousand times worse than this is made out to be. (Sword Art Online or Attack on Titan, anyone?)\\n\\n\\n\\n",

First 2 episodes ended me up watching the whole series in 2 sittings (12 or 13 eps/day, which is very abnormal IMO) and ended up rewatching 2 more times and reading the novel in a span of 2months.\r\nToradora. Most people have no idea what the title means. Neither did I when I saw this the first time. I assumed it was some typical rom-com story of unrequited love. And yes, it's exactly like that inthe first episodes. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, as the story and characters began to develop, it presents something deeper than just simple romance. Cherishing friendship, staying  in \"comfort zones,\" letting go, et cetera. It doesn't focus on the shallow side of romance. And that's what sets it apart from other anime of same genre.\\n\\n\r\nOne very strong point: character development.\\n\\n\r\nOne weakness: it was rushed towards the end. The anime somewhat drifted from the novel in around ep 22+ (i think). So I recommend reading the novel at least from V7 onwards (better if you read from the start, of course).\\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, the anime is very very good and is recommended to everyone.",

            "content": "This is a classic!\r\nWhen I first heard of this anime, I didn't watch it straight away because even though my friend told me it was the best anime he had seen, I didn't see a potential for greatness. It looked decent. He had mentioned it other times since then but didn't push me into it. I think it was mostly a \"why not, I'm curious\" attitude that got me to see this show. I watched the first four episodes, not long after I was tempted to see more, and then only stopped because I required sleep. Then I got up early, started again, stopped onlybecause a friend wanted to see me, then finished the show. In short, I was hooked and by the end as close to crying as any anime got me.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is about an odd boy named Ryuji and a delinquent girl named Taiga, the palm top tiger. Their first meeting doesn't go well. Then Taiga accidentally leaves a confession letter meant for someone else in Ryuji's bag, then goes to his house to make sure he can't use it against her. Instead he calms her down and agrees to help this unruly girl get together with Ryuji's eccentric best friend Kentemura. Their first attempt fails and Ryuji is free to not help Taiga but he decides to continue helping her, and soon enough Taiga becomes an honorary member of Ryuji's family.\\n\\n\r\nFirst off, we must mention the ungodly pacing. The amount of content packed into a single 25 minute episode without having to rush it is mind boggling. A typical Toradora episode has the content of two to three episodes of another anime yet flows naturally. This also ensures there aren't any pointless filler with every episode contributing. This is the only series I can think of where there isn't a single bad or lack luster episode. Every episode is high quality, and you'd be surprised how hard that is even for a twenty five episode show. This pacing also gives immense room for characterization and development, where the show shines most. The five main characters all get a good chunk of development, with the main two getting the most of course, and they all get it every episode in some form or other. This results in the anime becoming a home away from home, with a sense of familiarity and adventure in even their most common activities. The humor, while involving some slapstick, is mostly from the character's personalities, be it Taiga's spiteful snarkyness, or Kentmura's zannyness or Ryuji's habits.\\n\\n\r\nThis series also boasts amazing drama, and it does so without gimmicks that other highschool romance shows use. We don't see Taiga or Minori getting kidnapped by some biker gang with Ryuji needing to come to the rescue. We don't see attempted rapes or psychotic people trying to murder one of the love interests so they can move in like many highschool romances(and I honestly expected at least one of those to pop up in this show at some point) Now there's not necessarely anything wrong with those plot events, but it says a lot that Toradora can create much more powerful drama with events on a much smaller scale, and don't think this show can't produce some intense moments despite it's light hearted tone.\\n\\n\r\nThere are still some highschool romance conventions here but they're all played well. Toradora is up there as an all time favorite of mine, with not many romance anime out there that can compare to it. If you have never seen a romance anime before you should start with this one. \\n\\n\r\nSince it is one of my all time favorite anime i give it a overall 10. i know most people would give the animation 9 or the sound a 9 but what really matters in the end is your enjoyment and for me its a 10! :)",

            "content": "Someone recommended this anime to me and I have to say thanks! I really like slice of life animes because the anime genre is so filled with mech, fantasy, and otherworldly animes to the point where a good normal anime with normal characters is a refreshing change of pace. However, even if the anime features normal characters, the characters still have to be interesting, exciting, and just plain watchable and the creators of Tordora understood that. My first impression of the anime with the male lead Ryuuji and his problem of people thinking he's some sort of thug based on his looks grabbed my attention,it seems interesting because who hasn't been prejudged by others based on their looks? But when we meet pint sized Taiga I became a little apprehensive. The reason is because for some reason anime creators and writers never seem to give women much diversity on a show, especially when it is a female lead. So when I saw her, I thought. Okay, she will either be a mega annoying whining bitch or some super sweet goddess. It turns out that she was neither. As a matter of fact none of these characters can be truly described by one or two words. But I can use one word, human.  Seriously there isn't a character I can say I dislike because one moment I am hating certain actions then the next moment I am rooting for them. I couldn't help but feel a bit nostalgic while watching because it reminded me a lot of my days in high school and all my friends who were very similar to many of the characters on the show. \\n\\n\r\nI don't want to give away too much but the story is about two people who meet and form an almost instant friendship as they help each other get the person they are crushing on. Although the story is simple, the viewer has to almost decipher the words and actions of certain characters and sometimes even when you think you have their feelings sorted out, you could be wrong. However, as good as the story and the characters are, it is not without its flaws. For example, there is a certain character who just stops liking another character and you have no idea when it happened, this is one of the things the viewer is left to decipher, which I don't think it should have been done that way because it just comes across as the writers finding ways to add drama to the story, although the viewer is given subtle hints to leads to the characters decisions, we never see that final realization that ultimately leads to the choices they make. another example, there was a certain female character who suddenly began acting strange and we find out later that it is because that character has always liked a certain male character, However, we are never treated to a single moment to indicate that this female character ever had romantic feelings or the male character, we are just told by another female character that this particular female is good at pretending so you're left to assume that she fooled the viewers by her actions and now her feelings are all coming out. \\n\\n\r\nCertain actions from the characters ticked me off near the end but the writers made up for it with a great ending that remains true to the characters in the story.\\n\\n",

If you're looking for a heartwarming, tear-jerking anime to fall in love with, look no further- Toradora is an amazing anime, well worth the watch.\r\nThe main reasons I enjoyed this series was because of the superb character development and execution of plot. As a reader of the light novels, I was surprised how well the anime stuck to the plot (which is excellent) and executed it well. Each character had their own epiphany which made them very interesting and added a great deal of depth. At only \r\nThe music in this series also cannot gowithout praise. The deciding factor in comparing this to the LN or manga would be that while the pacing of plot is off sometimes, the perfect timing of the OST is too good to miss out. Needless to say, I fell in love with both of the outros.\\n\\n\r\nPraise aside, I wanted to also comment on how sometimes the plot seems slower relative to the latter parts. If I were to compare Toradora's enjoyability to a math function, it would look like an exponential curve upward. While the slow beginning is necessary for character development, it is well worth the wait for the events that follow. I docked off points on character based on how believable I thought the characters were, and the enjoyment based on rewatchability.\\n\\n\r\nBOTTOM LINE: Fellow shojo lovers should have no problem enjoying Toradora!

            "content": "Imagine having to write a story, possibly a love story. \r\nThere are two ways to make it interesting. The first is to create a lot of unexpected events, twist and backstabs that create interest. The other is to simply write interesting characters that create interest even in everyday events. \r\nYou almost always see the former. The reason is simple, adding more flat/cringeworthy characters or writing an absurd plot twist take little effort and still keep the user interested. On the other hand, creating an everyday story with no twist and making it interesting by having great characters and great character development is something that isseen extremely, extremely rarely. Especially so in anime, where the classic love comedy is full of absurd misunderstandings, copious amount of tears and a sometimes a load of female character only to make you wonder \"who will end with who\". \\n\r\nAs you may have guessed by now, Toradora! is a case of the latter. There are no plot twist, no unexpected new characters, no unexplicable sudden change of minds, no supernatural revelations. You aren't here to wait for exceptional events, and in fact the story begin by telling you how it will end, even before you start looking. The anime name \"Toradora!\" is the combination of the names of the two main protagonists. Four of the main five characters are already all here from episode one, while the last appear in episode 5. From there it's only well-written and believable character development.\\n\\n\r\nThe fact that the anime manage to be interesting even when you already know the ending and nothing exceptional happen (to be honest, you could consider two episode to be something of exceptional, i personally don't) tell a lot about the strenght of its writing and especially of its characters. No one of them fall in a clear stereotype, no one of them do dumb things only to make the plot progress, they but do only what they should do. And everyone of them is a beautiful character with many layers, like a real person (ironically, the least detailed ones are the two mains, for accessibility reasons). \\n\r\nAll the story progression happen at the right pace, and there are a lot of hints and hidden details you'll hardly catch at a first view but that will clarify a lot of more \"obscure\" behaviours you may notice.\\n\\n\r\nNot only the writing and the characters are good, the double level of reading of the plot is also one of its strong point. While Toradora! may appear at first as a love story, and a lovable and well written one (remembering far more the classic american love story than an anime), Toradora! is not just that. Toradora! is a story of growth and show, even drastically, that the desire we have can not always be fulfilled, that if they can, there are sacrifice to be done, and it does so even at the cost of going against the viewer's expectations (so beautifully meta). But it's not a simple coming of age story where the character reach \"maturity\". Toradora! show that growing isn't a trip with a destination, but rather an endless discovery in all directions where you must sometimes stop and look again at what you have thrown away during your wanderings. While this is not a really new or amazing concept for other kind of media (books and movies have been there countless times), in anime such a deep message it almost come as a shock, especially with a good execution to boot.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTo put it simply, Toradora! is the the best love comedy in anime form since the times of Maison Ikkoku, and it share with MI its ability to not be narrow and focused only on one aspect of life, but it space on everything  (from work to family to fears), even if narrowly due to the short duration of it compared to MI. And even if Toradora! doesn't best Maison Ikkoku (it has still many, many flaw that i won't list here, almost all due to the nature of modern anime), it has given me the hope that Japan can still write a good love story, even if once each twenty years. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Romance stories have begun to fall in a trap it seems. Many become predictable and unoriginal, turning into yet another harem comedy to join the ranks. Romance stories need to be original, but not at the cost of emotion that goes along with falling in love. Sometimes it isn't as easy as seeing someone and pursuing them until they fall in love with you. God knows, hearts will be broken when that same person falls in love with someone else. Its not about the mind, its about the heart, and following it. Add a little slapstick comedy and a cute tsundere, and you have theheartwarming story of Toradora.\\n\\n\r\nToradora takes a common theme (two people fall in love with the others best friend and grow closer) and finds a way to make it more entertaining. Toradora blends romantic comedy and drama in a way that may surprise viewers. The comedy is very funny and cute, and the drama will have you watery eyed and longing for a happy end.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is very good, but it would be what I consider the weak point. The overall design is cute, and there are scenes where the art is simply breathtaking (remember to watch out for the xmas scene), but at others such as fight scenes, the art is quite strange and the characters look off. However, in a way it adds a certain intensity.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is gorgeous and  adorable at the same time. The music will keep the mood bouncy when the characters are up to their shenanigans, and will move you to tears at the sad moments. The soundtrack is masterfully done. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters would be what I would call where it is the straongest. Each character has so much personality that you feel like they are real (Ami being the strongest for me), and whenever one shows up, you always feel that something is going to happen.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this series immensely, and would recommend it to everyone. This is the perfect romance anime, and force viewers to have opinions about what they feel. They may not agree with the outcome, but who is to say that the way they fall in love is wrong, or who we fall in love with is wrong? If you want to watch an anime that will make you feel good about the love that you have, whether it be for family, friends, or your loved one, this is the one. You will not be disappointed.\\n",

            "content": "Ryuji Takasu was an \"average\" second year student who was mistaken to be a delinquent due to the pair of eyes he inherited from his father. This caused much misunderstanding to occur in his life in school.One day,he accidentally walked into Taiga Aisaka, who is also known as the Palmtop Tiger for her aggressive personality despite her size.After a sequence of events, the two decided to help each other to attain the hearts of their crush. However,this partnership led to an unexpected twist of events between the two and those around them.\r\nStory & Characters (8/10)\r\nThis series is your basic slice-of-life romance story, but not withyour typical \"ugly\" loves \"beauty\". In fact both main protagonists are labeled delinquents of the school. While the main female protagonist, Aisaka Taiga, is a \"true delinquent\" of sorts, the main male protagonist, Takasu Ryuuji, is only labeled as one because of his eyes. Oh before I forget, yes Taiga is a pun from the title where \"tora\" is \"tiger\" (Taiga being pronouced as it looks; \"tai-gah\", more puns in the series but thats the obvious one). Now being a deliquent doesn't necessarily mean the protagonists are ugly per se, its just the other students wouldn't exactly put these two characters on their \"top people to date\" list.\\n\\n\r\nNow the series starts of with Ryuuji's first day of the start of his second year in high school. He comes to school with some good fortune, not only finding himself back in class with his best friend, Kitamura Yusaku, but also with his crush Kushieda Minori (also called Minorin). Now when there's something good, there's always something bad and word gets around about Aisaka (she being called the \"Palmtop Tiger\") and after an incident, Ryuuji gets knocked out by Taiga herself. Now to sum it all up, from there thats when the story really begins, Ryuuji somehow finds himself a \"leashed dog\" with Taiga has his owner. Also come to find out Kushieda (Ryuuji's crush) is best friends with Taiga. So from all that, if you're not confused already, shows how complicated things just got for Ryuuji.\\n\\n\r\nWell the story itself starts out pretty predictable for about the first 7 episodes. Actually some could say the outcome of the entire series was predictable, but what made this story stand out more was the execution and characters. Stepping away from our two main characters, we get a character list that's pretty impressive considering the fact. Going with my favorite first, Kushieda Minori. She is the \"athletic\" character who is the type to take charge and very active. In fact at times you wonder if she even has a life, let alone wondering where the hell she gets her energy from. Fortunately enough, just like alot of the characters in the series, she's more complex than she looks. Without straying from the main plot, they allow for plenty of moments to show her \"other side\". She's one of those that puts up a front with people but will only show her true self amongst those she really cares for. She's not the outspoken-type despite being very ambitious. One could say all of her activity is her way of escaping her sorrowed life (however don't think its tragic or anything because its really not, just typical teenage angst).\\n\\n\r\nA couple other characters who get some significant screen time are Kitamura Yusaku and Kawashima Ami. Its plainly obvious what position these characters play. Kitamura plays the \"best friend\" while Kawashima supplies the \"rival\" aspect in the love triangle. Surprisingly enough, after the halfway point, everything that made the typical \"character sheet\" gets thrown out the window. What I mean is, every anime story kinda follows a set format on characters (more true in slice-of-life series than anything else). Like for example, you have the best friend that provides the needed advice, or you would have the childhood friend (who in some cases can be the best friend or love interest) or maybe you might have the dense main character who can't tell when a girl/guy likes him/her. Now what Toradora did was start out with your basic format (i.e. Ryuuji = dense, Kushieda/Kitamura = best friends), but halfway through started juggling these traits around through everyone. No longer do we have the static characters that, unlike other slice-of-life shows where no matter how much their interests change, they're personality traits don't, they encompass all traits at one point other another. A good example of this is, again, at the halfway point (about episode 13 or 14, something like that), Kawashima Ami goes from being a \"rival\"-type to more of the \"good friend\"-type. Their traits change with the rest of their personality.\\n\\n\r\nThis story and character list were well written and really starts to blossom after the first 7 episodes or so. If you're one of those that got bored with it during the first couple episodes and stopped watching it, I suggest picking it back up again.\\n\\n\r\nArt (6/10)\\n\r\nDefinitely a step up from alot of shows over recent years. This is one of those series that really does its best to show off the good animation and direction but keeping the sharpen and bright look of the series. Its like when, say, you watched something like Beck, where you want some of the good animation to be accompanied by some clearer and more detailed art? That's not to say Toradora is extremely detailed or anything, but it does supply the feel that it is. I guess one could say Toradora is like the jack-of-all-trades in art. It wasn't the best in any one area, but it did good enough in all aspects of the art that you can't say its average or worse. Its supplies exuberant amount of bright colors that it gives off the right impression of a light-hearted, comedic yet romantic-at-times anime.\\n\\n\r\nIt has its faults however in the fact, as said before, it doesn't excel in any particular area. In every average to above average anime, there's always something that it excels at. Unfortunately for Toradora, Art wasn't where it shines the most. For me it was the story, not the art that charmed and made me come back for another dose. Yes its a step up from other shows in recent years, but there are definitely a number of series that excel better in the Art area than this series.\\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10)\\n\r\nAh, always my favorite section because music in anime have generally been nice to me. The series surely doesn't disappoint but it does have a number of insert songs that probably sounds better to others than it did me. Now the opening and ending songs were good for this series. \"Pre-Parade\" was a energetic song that really symbolized how energetic the first half of the series was. Bouncing off of that you head into the ending song for the first half which was \"Vanilla Salt\". I can safely say I haven't really listened to that song much because it just doesn't hook me enough. Good lyrics is one thing, but if the music itself doesn't compliment the lyrics well enough, you're going to have problems. For me, I just didn't get good vibes from it. Going into the second half of the series, you have \"Silky Heart\" for the opening and \"Orange\" for the ending. Probably the most listened to song out of all of Toradora is \"Orange\", followed by \"Silky Heart\". When watching the ending video and listening to \"Orange\", it made more sense to me for the tempo the second half of the series kinda followed. \"Silky Heart\" felt more in tune to the feelings of the characters and how they felt when you came up to the end of the series. I had the unfortunate experience of watching the official music video for \"Silky Heart\". Problem there is the dance steps and direction for the video really did nothing for the song. It felt like everything in the video sucked away all the energy that the song had in it. Warning for you all, don't watch the official music video for \"Silky Heart\", it does nothing good for the song in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nThe insert songs are a different story however. They enhanced and played well in the anime, but when I listened to them full-length, outside of the anime, I didn't get the same feelings. Its like they lost all emotion when set on their own for me. Prime example is the \"Holy Night\" insert song. Played great and greatly improved the episode it was played in, but outside of it, I felt it lacked. Songs like these really shouldn't be put on CDs but again, when dealing in the anime world, fans just want to have everything from their favorite shows (yes I am one of them, heh). A completists' dream.\\n\\n\r\nThere's not much to say for the VAs. They were good as to be expected for their roles. I will say they have an impressive cast list. Not just for the main set of characters but for the supporting list as well. They had some up-and-coming VAs along with some established VAs in the industry. For example, just a couple seconds ago, while I'm writing this, I was taking a look again at the cast list for this show (been about a year and a half since I've seen the show) and I saw that Nonaka Ai (who played Ibuki Fuko from Clannad, a prominent character in the series) played the role of a supporting character known as Kihara Maya. Reason why I didn't know this is because I didn't see Clannad until the summer following the ending of Toradora (Toradora ended in March of 09, watched Clannad in the summer). To see such a cast list is really promising. There's nothing to be worried about in the VA department of this series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7/10)\\n\r\nThis series was slated as a 25-episode series, but I guess they wanted to maintain the 26-episode length that the anime world is notoriously known for, so they threw in a special as the 26th episode. Its obviously not an episode needing to be watched in regards to the main story so no need to bend over backwards to see it. Any how, there's a lot of good things to say about the series but for a change of pace, I'm ma head straight into the bad first.\\n\\n\r\nFact is there's nothing really standout-ish about this series aside from some pretty well written characters. Now some would say that's a good thing and why others would list this series as \"perfect\", but that's not correct. For a perfect series everything would stand out and make for a long discussion about each part. So far the only portions I've elaborated on were the characters. I talked a bit about the sound but that's only for tidbit information I thought was interesting to include. Unfortunately its a pretty hard stretch to sit here and talk about Toradora for more than maybe 10 minutes before you start repeating yourself. That's pretty much how long this reading should be, give or take a couple more minutes. If it was up to me, this entire overall section would've been put up in two sentences but I figure I'd be better off explaining myself a bit more.\\n\\n\r\nThis series' re-viewability is extremely small. Once you've seen it once, you remember everything. I stated earlier that its been year since the ending of Toradora and I haven't re-watched it since, yet I was still able to give you a pretty good summary of what happened in the first 10 or so minutes of the first episode. I could literally sit here and tell the entire story, episode by episode, without having to re-watch any of it. That's a good and bad thing.\\n\\n\r\nToradora was a well executed series and has a charm to it that makes watching it fun and interesting, yet one could say the charm was too strong. Take your favorite movie for example. You get drawn back into because not only did you not catch everything the first time, but you enjoy it enough to watch it over and over again without getting tired of the same ol' stuff. Toradora on the other hand was too strong where you loved watching it, but paid too much attention to all the details which makes you lose the need to re-watch it. I will give this series credit though, the jokes were pretty funny and I found myself laughing time and time again.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, definitely one to pick up and watch through. In fact I urge people to at least give it a shot for the first 14 episodes (second half starts at episode 15), after that make your decision. However don't be surprised if you decide to include this in your DVD collection, that you never watch it more than once more for a long time.\\n",

            "content": "What I expected to be a stereotypical high school drama turned out to be one of the most charming, entertaining, and funny series I have ever had the pleasure of watching.\r\nI first discovered Toradora! through a forum post and thought I 'd give it a try. To be perfectly honest I wasn't expecting much. Seeing the words \"high school, romance, and comedy\" all together makes me think that it will just be something that takes things too seriously when it doesn't need to and takes things too lightly when it shouldn't. Toradora! however, does the exact opposite.\r\nI won't go into the story for the sakeof not giving anything away, however, if you've ever seen a romantic comedy, you can see the ending coming from a mile away. But trust me when I say that this doesn't subtract from the enjoyment of the show at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe art of the show is very high quality. It doesn't deviate too far from the traditional anime art style, but at the same time the show manages to have something unique about it. It is very colorful in all aspects, from backgrounds to the characters themselves, even the title card shows this trend. However, nothing ever blends together, which is essential for this type of art style to work. I can't complain about anything in relation to art really.\\n\\n\r\nFor sound, I will assume this category refers to soundtrack and voice acting, both of which Toradora! excels in. Both opening and ending themes are very pop-like (for lack of a better term) which I didn't like at first, but they grew on me to the point of them becoming some of my favorite openings in any anime. As for the voice acting, personally I watched the show in English (I know I'm not a real Otaku and Senpai will never notice me) and I absolutely loved the voice acting. None of the characters had an unfitting and/or annoying voice, which usually tends to happen in English dubs unfortunately. The entire cast performs excellently. No complaints in this department what so ever.\\n\\n\r\nNow on to my favorite part of the show, the characters. By far, at least in my opinion, the characters are the absolute best part of Toradora! None of the characters are boring at any point of the show. They aren't one dimensional or dull in the slightest and don't just fall into typical character stereotypes, except for perhaps Taiga who is pretty much just a tsundere character but even then there seems to be an extra dimension to her character that is difficult to explain without spoilers so I'll let you find out for yourself. Even the characters I dislike, I do not dislike them because they are boring or not fun to watch, I dislike them as if they were a real person, for who they are. Not to give anything away but Ami is an example of this. I dislike her most of the time, but the extra dimension she has makes her motivations clear and she ends being entirely different than originally portrayed. I apologize for the vague and all over the place description, but I don't want to give anything away. You should truly experience the characters yourself.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed Toradora! enough for it to become my favorite anime, which says a lot considering I wasn't expecting anything from it. I was honestly disappointed when the show ended, not because I disliked the ending but because I didn't know what I could possibly watch that I would enjoy as much as my first watch through of Toradora! The rewatch value on the show though is incredible, and I never get bored of it.\\n\\n\r\nI would highly recommend you watch Toradora! if you haven't already. I can almost guarantee you will not regret it. \\n",

            "content": "For a long time I wasn't interested in this anime, because it seemed like another overrated comedy that I probably wouldn't even find funny. However, after trying the first episode I quickly realized this show isn't what it appeared to be.\r\nMy biggest problem with most romances I have seen is when two characters love each other on the very first episode... for seemingly no reason at all. You get no explanation of why they love each other nor do you see the feelings develop. The romance is basically just thrown in your face and the girl almost looks like she's fawning over some guy shethinks is hot or vice verse with a guy fawning over a hot girl. \\n\\n\r\nToradora, however, does not do this.\\n\\n\r\nThe series starts off rather light-hearted and enjoyable; in fact, there are even some jokes thrown in that I actually did laugh at. The two main characters - Ryuuji and Aisaka - both have a love interest and Ryuuji is friends with Aisaka's, while Aisaka is friends with his. Because of this, they decide to team up to win the affection of the ones they love. So overall it sounds like your typical romantic comedy, but as the series progresses you actually see the main romance in the series progress and you can actually understand why the two characters fall in love.\\n\\n\r\nLater on in the series there was some pointless drama and there were a few other things I didn't like about the series, which prevents me from rating this series a 10. However, this series has a great story, great animation, and a lot of other things which make this story enjoyable, which makes me feel this series a 9/10.",

            "content": "I'm going to be honest right now: Ever since I started getting involved in the anime community, I've constantly made fun of romance anime. There are just a lot of preconceptions out there, and I (maybe regretfully) had a lot of bias based upon the views of others. So when I heard about Toradora! from a friend (FinalFlashX on this site, if you're curious), I was somewhat hesitant to view it. I thought it had great potential based on his review, but I also thought it could be something that just wasn't my cup of tea. \r\nI'm here to tell you that, after viewing Toradora!,I instantly placed it as one of my favorite anime of any genre. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the things that really perturbs me is when someone states an anime like Toradora! is bad simply because they dislike romance, as I used to do. It's unfair to discredit it as a whole just because the genre isn't to your liking. So, before you click \"not helpful\" on my review just because you think romantic storytelling is \"stupid\", please give this a read and reconsider your opinion.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY:\\n\\n\r\nToradora! is a well-crafted plot that, aside from a few minor issues, makes a lot of sense. It's important to keep in mind the age of the characters here: high school kids. Thus, a lot of erroneous decisions with poor logic will be made, and it reflects on the realism of the story because it's not unintentional, either; most poor decisions are reciprocated with backlash of some kind that spurs character development, so it's not by any laziness on the author's part. \\n\\n\r\nThe pacing of the narrative is a double-edged sword. For one, it's a perfect length for character development and gives plenty attention to the development of actual relationships between characters rather than forcing anything. And I'm not talking about romantic relationships only; development between friendships is given a lot of thought and attention as well. On the other hand, though, the story suffers from a delay of the inevitable. From the beginning it's not hard to tell the gist of the end result, and the whole story continues to make it somewhat obvious. However, in my opinion that's not really a large issue; just because you know what happens doesn't mean you know HOW it happens, and the journey is the most fun and entertaining part.\\n\\n\r\nSometimes I hear people saying that Takemiya should have expanded upon the world a little bit, but it wasn't really necessary seeing that it was set in a world that's exactly the same as ours. She gave insight into the important things, such as Taiga's family and the school, and that's all that I could ask for as a viewer. \\n\\n\r\nOne of my main issues with the plot was that the narrative wasn't very conceptually creative. There weren't an abundance of cliches by any means, and while there were some surprises, overall it maintained a fairly generic structure. If not for the fantastic characterization, it would have been rather bland in my opinion. However, that only knocks it down a notch or two because it was overall an entertaining storyline regardless. \\n\\n\r\nThematically, Toradora! isn't very deep or profound. Some of the main concepts explored are the obvious in a romance, but the ones that were more interesting to me were the ones relating to beating the preconceptions people set for you in order to achieve something great, e.g. love. This will be explored more in the character section.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\\n\r\nI'll just say it now: the characters in Toradora! are absolutely phenomenal. \\n\\n\r\nTakemiya does a fantastic job by creating misconceptions that are removed with depth to each character. Every character of the main cast begins as an archetype/cliche, but quickly she creates explainable layers to all of them, making them well-rounded and complex. It serves the theme of being able to get past surface-feature qualities very well. Creating conflict between the outer appearances and inner characterizations of the characters makes them very interesting and likable as well.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the story, meaningful development is given to all of the main cast. This story is character-driven, and it is reflected beautifully in the writer's progression of the tale. Taiga, Ryuuji, Ami, and Minori are all very, very well-written and complex characters, and that alone is worth the price of admission. (In your case, probably free, but... shut up! It's a phrase!)\\n\\n\r\nHell, even the minor characters are entertaining and fun to watch. They aren't the most detailed characters in the world, but they serve their purpose well. Not every character has to be dynamic and complex; if they make the story better, then that's all there is to it, and the minor characters keep a lighthearted mood and aid in the development of characterization and plot. \\n\\n\r\nThe character relationships are also very well-written. They are paced well and develop slowly and meaningfully while maintaining some idealism with realistic outcomes. They lead to great characterization and development and are perfect examples of relationships in the anime medium in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION:\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the animation is very solid. The characters look fantastic, and the backgrounds are well-drawn. The definition is also very clean, although that's more of a benefit of the time this was made rather than anything special on the animators' parts. \\n\\n\r\nI will say that there are several scenes that look very... meh. Particularly the scene in which there is a fist-fight. The movements look very choppy and all the high-definition is replaced with very average looking animation. This could be due to a budget change or something, but the episode following this looks back to normal, so I'm not quite sure. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the character design is usually good, not much thought was put into some of the minor characters. For example, there is a somewhat important character who looks almost exactly the same as one of the main characters, and a very minor character who looks nearly identical to a different main character. While the mains look very unique and well-fashioned, the minor characters don't have that benefit. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack in Toradora! is absolutely fantastic. For all types of moods there are great tracks that are used in very fitting spots and that aid in the emotional aspect of the show. I was a big fan of the first opening for whatever reason, and the second opening was okay, while I thought the endings were just average, but the soundtrack absolutely makes up for that.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting in both the sub and the dub is phenomenal. I slightly prefer the dub but I will say that you can't go wrong either way. Taiga and Ami really stood out to me in the dub, and I also liked Ryuuji's voice actor a lot, which is a bit of a controversial opinion, so prepare for maybe some dissent in what you think versus what I do. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\\n\r\nToradora! is a truly great anime. If you like the romance genre, then you will love this anime. If you don't, I think you will see that it is written well enough where you will appreciate it, but maybe not think it's for you. If you haven't given romance a try, this is a great first step. I recommend it to everyone.",

            "content": "(My very first review, lol). I'm into a lot of animes, but the least anime I watch is Mecha. Romantic Comedies, Action, Slice of Life, Drama/School are my thing. Few examples of what I watch; Anohana, Angel Beats, Attack on Titan, Darker than Black, Toradora, Kaichou Wa Maid Sama, The Devil is a Part Timer, Witchblade, Heaven's Memo Pad, etc. \r\nThese are solely based off of my opinions and everyone is entitled to theirs, of course.\r\nMy short version of the review: One of my favorite animes, good OSTs (Lost My Pieces). \r\nToradora, I actually finished watching the sub but I gotta say that the dubversion was good. Most romantic comedies are a bit clich\u00e9 but which anime now and then aren't? It's like everything is clich\u00e9. Nonetheless onto the review and ratings of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe story (10): It wasn't too clich\u00e9, you have opposite protagonists who are feared by many but make one hell of a team. They like each other's best friends and you watch their acquaintance/friendship blossom throughout the series. I like it because the story carries the story instead of some 12 episode romantic comedy and the ending, not typical endings like some romantic comedy. \\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation (9): The anime was had good animations and drawing. It's a lot better than other animes I've seen. \\n\\n\r\nSound (9): I enjoyed the dub version and the OST is just awesome. Most of their voices were good/convincing. When watching English dub, sometimes they can't really pull off the voice or match it with the character so that's why Sub is what I prefer but some animes can have good dubs and Toradora is one of those. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter (9): At first I've wondered why Ryuji had more slanted eyes and those are the traits of his dad. Every character were developed good, could say that Taiga looks a lot like Hiyori from \"Hiyokoi\". Both short, light brown hair with hazel like eyes. I tend to find that \"celeb\" like anime characters are a bit... snobby and stuck up, which is a sort of clich\u00e9 but they are a good asset to making animes a bit interesting. Also the characters get into their emotions which shows you a side to someone, showing that they too aren't always what they seem to be, like the quote \"Looks can be deceiving.\"\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10): I just enjoyed this anime, as I've said before it's one of my favorites. They kept me in a good mood, laughed when remarks were made to someone, sad when that sort of scene comes on.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (10): I've enjoyed this anime as others, it get's me in my feels which I like because even if animes are animations, you can learn things from them (it sounds silly but that's what I believe.) You can learn anything from anyone.",

Every characters story is unique and everyone has a unique personality which just makes it feel so authentic. \r\n7 hours after finishing the anime and I still feel like there is a hole in my heart wanting more, so id rate it 10/10, I literallycouldn't find anything wrong with the anime and I would recommend it to literally anyone and to anyone with a special spot in their heart for love \\n\\n\\n",

It has a really sleek nostalgic presentation and is really comfy in its own way. Every relevant character is dynamic. The animation is just dazzling in my personal opinion for 2008. It's very very nostalgic. It's cute, funny, memorable and very re-watchable. It does a really good job taking the concept of a \"Tsundere\" character and making them unconventional. I'd say its pretty worthy of being a top 10 show. Indeed the basis of the show itself issomething we've seen many times, but this show is special in its own fathomable way.",

But I promise you I would have watched most of the anime's on the recommendations page after writing this review, but sadly there will never be an anime quite like Toradora! The story line was amazing, each episodes I was truly astonished about the love and drama they managed to fit into each episode. As the story progressed, so did the relationships between the characters - and my god It was truly tear jerking. I believe that we all dream of love like the one between Ryuuji and Aisaka. Icould sit and write for hours about how amazing this anime is and how a season 2 would be amazing but rubbish at the same time. But after finishing this I believe, while still in discussion, the anime ended elegantly - and to me personalty a realistic but optimistic ending which is above the norms for romance. To wrap this up;\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is amazing, its a story that people who watch will never regret to see and I believe the story was quite original and the anime is just ... amazing. I struggle to describe a piece of art, no... a masterpiece. I would recommend everyone to watch this as this will truly pull some heart strings and will make you reflect on life and your future. Damn - this is fricking amazing anime - its on like top 3 for me.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways gonna end it here its way past midnight. I have never done a review this long - so many emotions and thoughts surging through my mind.

The last episode has an after credits scene and I think that many people disliked the ending because they missed it. \r\nI started hating some of the characters at the beginning, but those characters quickly became my favorites as they developed. All the characters were realistic to an extent and had fantastic development throughout the story. You won't regret watching this if you've liked other romcoms or slice of life shows. The ending was satisfying and made Toradora feel likea complete and perfectly executed story.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is unlike any other I've watched, characters with somewhat ridiculous personalities come together and form a unique and relatable group. Throughout the story each character changes the personalities of others in the group, while maintaining a humorous and light hearted atmosphere that makes difficult situations bearable. Although I wish there was more content, this anime did not leave me feeling empty inside, unlike other shows, when it was over. Few shows have an ending comparable to that of toradora's, leaving no loose ends and providing a definite end to the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack and op/ed themes were perfect, and the story was unique and not too cliche. The characters felt like those in kimi no na wa: not perfectly realistic but enjoyable in a different way. Thanks for reading",

But for this one, I was really only left with two significant realizations:\r\n1. Watching Toradora! is like taking a stallion's dose of viagra just before strolling through a Renaissance art gallery. Never, in my entire life, have I seen a show that draws out the sexual tension between its characters for so long. The cruelty of this phenomenon, however, was intensely refreshing. Most other shows in the same genre rely solely on eye candy to hold their viewers' attention; Toradora! simply refuses to do that- and withgood reason. It's as if the producers are shouting, \"look, everyone- we've got great voice actors, great music, great character development, and a great plot- so we're not going to spam cleavage every two minutes and risk having you miss out on all the good stuff.\"\\n\\n\r\n2. If you're similar to me, you probably don't like a few specific genres. Not just anime genres- I'm talking about all forms of art. For instance, I don't particularly like country music, modern art, or- and here's where I retain topical relevance- romance anime. I mean, seriously. Nine times out of ten, animated romcoms make me feel like a perverted, balding sociopath. Or at least, I'm pretty sure that they would if I had actually watched ten of them (and I definitely haven't). But the thing is, every genre has at least a couple masterpieces- art that even the snobbiest critics can't help but appreciate. Well, Toradora! is definitely one of the few exceptions to my hatred for romantic anime. The reason I bring this up is to encourage those of you who are on the fence to give it a try. People who normally like romcoms have already seen it ages ago; but I can almost guarantee that you'll enjoy it, too- regardless of how cynical you may be.",

Instead it relies on the major characteristics of the characters instead of giving the characters more depth. For example, a lot of important details about the characters were overlooked when the plot was getting more and more complex. These include things such as background and general biases when talking about the type of characters in the show. For example, although Ryuji was supposedly a responsible, yet immature, character, the creators could give him more depth by talkinga lot about Ryuji's feelings about his family background early on. This would make the anime more consistent. \\n\\n\r\n(spoilers incoming)\\n\\n\r\nThe ending was pretty bad as the anime became extremely emotive when it came to the character's making decisions and expressing themselves. This was a huge contrast from the beginning where the show was relying a lot on each characters' individual motives, and portraying a lot of their decisions to abide by some sort of moral code that each character had built in their lives. Furthermore, the supporting characters became more and more obsolete when nearing the end of the show, and it felt a lot like the creators were trying to push in everything together. \\n\\n\r\nThe only personal issue I have with the anime is that it tries so hard to bring about each characters' shortcomings, that at the very end, it felt like the conclusion of the anime was something born because of the main characters' flaws. I have a problem with this personally because I think this anime was more suited towards having a conclusion where each character got what they set out to get, and I think that this anime's biggest failure was the conclusion. It felt very forced and the sudden change in emotions became something extremely unsettling in the show, and ruined the atmosphere when a lot of the drama climaxed.",

This anime is emotional at times, which just adds to how great it is. By the end of the show, I was in tears, it does such a good job at hitting you right in the feels. Most of the show is more of a comedy rather than a drama, but the ending is where it starts to come around. The art style is in fact, really good, and the characters are really easy to love. They all have goodpersonalities, and designs. They did a really good job capturing this high school romance.",

Ryuiji's features show he is big in helping others but is not independent as he has his eyes, needing help to find the way.While Taiga is shortand cute, showing that she is short in self esteem but is very self conscious about it.\\n\\n\r\nSound was reasonable, nothing more nothing less, just okay\\n\\n\r\nOverall I give this a 10/10, this is how every RomCom/Romance anime should base itself off of, original ideas which give off many twist and turns as they play around with the viewer teasing them about the up-coming events. Which happens to be a very big saying as in the ending it does not end as you think it will\\n\\n",

            "content": "I am not a fan of romance as a genre. I don't know why, I'm just not so I tend to avoid it. But something made me watch Toradora some time ago. Was it popularity as this show was all over the place on the website I used to visit when I was a teenager? Was it curiosity? Pretty art? I have no idea, but since then, I've rewatched it several times.\r\nStory: 9/10.\r\nIt's pretty simple. We have two characters that have crushes on each other's friends and a silly accident brings them together and they decide to help each other with their love lives. Intriguing,isn't it? The slice of life genre is hard to work with because what is there to say about life? How to make it interesting not only in the eyes of those who just like to sit back and enjoy a simple show about daily routine? Add suspence and plot twists. Although said plot twists are predictable, you can't help but wonder how they are going to work and that is pretty interesting too.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10.\\n\r\nProbably one of my favorite art styles so far + simple yet appealing character designs. Enough said? Enough said, I believe.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10.\\n\r\nIt's one of the shows that have soundtrack that got stuck in my head and it's still there. Catchy opening and ending themes plus tracks that create the right atmosphere. Of course, the cast of voice actors is not disappointing either.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10.\\n\r\nThe only character I kind of dislike is Minori because there was just something about her that felt fake. She was overly cheerful in a rather annoying way, being all over the place, and things got worse in the second half of the show, but even her presence is bearable.\\n\r\nI genuinely care for the rest of the cast, though. Taiga may seem like the very embodiment of every single aspect of 'tsundere', so it may seem kind of off-putting, but I saw a lot of myself in Taiga and, as a result, I found her surprisingly relatable.\\n\r\nCharacters have good qualities, they have flaws, they make mistakes and have their own ways to deal with hardships and, even though I said I didn't like Minori, I can't say I hate her. In fact, it's hard to hate any of the characters, even if they mess up on an epic scale because the cast in general is actually pretty likable and I appreciate it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10.\\n\r\nThis story can be funny. It can be sad. And you know what I don't like? When a show is trying too hard to be funny or make me cry. Thankfully, that's not the case. And you know, I really hope that, whatever happens to these guys next, they'll be okay because I want them to be happy. Yes, all of them, including my least favorite character. Because they deserve it.",

            "content": "Toradora. What can I say exactly? To me personally it was an anime that was just done right. Everything felt right, everything felt good and everything worked. \r\nFrom the first look on the cover you can\u2019t really infer much from it other than it probably is another anime set in a high school and five students in particular are important, because they are on the front cover. \r\n[Luckily for you, after meticulously researching (watching the series over and over) I have concluded that this anime is a shounen, harem series about a redhead tsundere who wants to bring justice (as well as embodying it) withher trusty dude companion to down a blondy. Wait what? Wrong series? You sure? Shi--]\\n\r\nEven if you understand the name \u201cToradora\u201d it still doesn\u2019t really tell you that much. \u201cTora\u201d being the Japanese word for tiger and \u201cDora\u201d being a shortened form of the Japanese \u201cDoragon\u201d which as you can probably tell means dragon. \\n\r\nHowever the fun starts once you break the cover and watch an episode or 2 or 5 or 10 or 25, because once you start, it\u2019s not particularly easy to stop (first hand experience). \\n\\n\r\nWithout further ado, let us begin. \\n\r\n[If you can\u2019t be \u201cbovered\u201d to read the entirety of this (essay) review (I don\u2019t blame ya), go to the end and there\u2019ll be a short TL;DR section. Baka. (jk jk)]\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation:\\n\r\nTo be brutally honest, the art is SH- (jk jk).\\n\r\nTo be brutally honest, I don\u2019t know where to start this review, so might as well be alphabetically at this stage. Right, going to the nitty gritty, the art style and animation isn\u2019t anything out of this world, but then again it doesn\u2019t need to be. From the prospective of the environment that the series is set in (yet another high school), it\u2019s pretty mundane and overused, hence it is fully justifiable; why go all out on making the generic high school (not the focal point of anime) looking like a f**king painting by Mashiro from Sakurasou, it wouldn\u2019t make sense. That said, when the art and animation needs to be good, it is blooming fantastic. This is shown throughout the series on the character\u2019s faces, and once they got that nailed down to a T, the rest of the anime just fitted in perfectly. Animation is great too, especially the subtle details on the character\u2019s faces and body language, and how easily it can be used to infer their emotions and reaction to a situation. \\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack and Voice:\\n\r\nAlright on second thought, alphabetically suck, so we are going to jump ahead and come back to characters. \\n\r\nThe soundtrack can only be described as right. There music always compliments what is happening on screen and unlike a lot of other animes out there, Toradora\u2019s soundtracks always feel fresh and add another layer of emotion and feeling. This is especially seen as some parts of the story where music takes more of the centre stage than the actual dialogue, and I can safely say that even without some of the dialogue, you can perfectly understand exactly what\u2019s going through each of the character\u2019s minds and the mood of the situation. Now, I would suggest that if you could, you should buy the entire OST for Toradora since it\u2019s just beautiful and of course one of the more notable songs is \u201cLost my pieces\u201d which alongside what you would have been witnessing on screen at the time that it\u2019s playing,  you would have felt an unusual stuffiness in your chest and your vision blurring (not a heart attack). OPs and EDs are also noteworthy; catchy, eccentric and suits the anime well. Right what\u2019s next?\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nSo development\u2019s dead right? I mean who doesn\u2019t want 1-dimensional soggy cardboard cut outs of the most clich\u00e9d animu tropes, am I right guys or am I right! I\u2019m not right? Well thank f*ck for that, it\u2019s good to see most of you are still sentient. \\n\r\nIf you like character development, then Toradora won\u2019t disappoint you to say the least. As I have mentioned there are 5 main characters and a few more not so main characters, but the interesting and definitely one of this show\u2019s strong points is the fact that by the end of 25 episodes, you\u2019ll know their names and what they\u2019re like pretty well and yes including the supporting cast (because hey guess what supporting characters are also important, without them, there would be no such thing as a main character).\\n\r\nOf course the main focus is going to be on the five I\u2019ve already mentioned (they spent FIVE episodes on introducing the characters, now THAT\u2019S dedication); now I won\u2019t spoil any character at all, not even going to tell you their names, even though you probably know what their names are. Toradora\u2019s development is subtle and big at the same time; subtle in the sense of going from episode to episode, you can\u2019t really make out any change, but if you compare what the characters are like at the beginning versus the end, you would be shocked at how different they are. That said, it\u2019s completely unfair to compare just the beginning and the end, since the entire journey is also very important. After saying this, I would recommend you watch the series at least twice, once to enjoy the story with no worries, and once more to witness the changes and development. \\n\r\nFavourite Character: Obviously the short, pettanko girl, I stick true to my name.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nUp till now I haven\u2019t mentioned what exactly is Toradora in terms of genre. Well if you haven\u2019t read the tags yet, Toradora is a romantic comedy. So right away you should know what to expect right? Nuh uh, this romantic comedy is not like any other. The story doesn\u2019t exactly follow two people and their interactions as lovers/friends soon to become lovers. No, this series follows two people and their interactions as practically frienemies, and their love for another two completely different people. So already breaking convention. \\n\r\nObviously if you\u2019ve seen the anime, what I\u2019ve just said would be simplification beyond what is deemed acceptable. This anime is set in the basis of a romcom, but the actual message goes much MUCH deeper. \\n\r\nWarning, may contain some \u201cspoilers\u201d (nothing from the actual anime, just the deeper meaning behind the anime, which I hope you want to enjoy and discover yourself and not read up on it prior to experiencing it. If you don\u2019t know what I\u2019m trying to say, go watch the anime first then come back to see if you agree with me).\\n\r\nFirstly, the anime explores is the idea of love itself, and its difference from the more common lust or obsession. Throughout the anime the main characters will think they are in \u201clove\u201d with a particular person but as the anime goes on they slowly realise what their true feelings are. It is this learning what love truly is for themselves and how they change/react in turn to it that is the real highlight of the series and one of the most unique portrayals of love as a concept than other romcoms. Because the show\u2019s characters realise (eventually) that love itself is not simple as they thought (unlike most romcom animes) and is a mystery that only they can solve and the answer only applies to themselves, that makes this all a bit real since that\u2019s how it works in this what we call reality too.\\n\r\nSecondly, the anime acknowledges the fact that love is not always what we associate with love. This can be seen during the first time the OP plays, \u201clove is something that\u2019s bittersweet\u201d, this sentence basically sums up what I\u2019m about to say. The anime acknowledges the fact that yes love is sweet like what we normally associate it with, but also it can hurt and in most cases, it will and does hurt both parties. But the anime the continues with this idea and shows to us that despite all the hardships, those who love each other stay together because they understand why sometimes it hurts and they become more appreciative of the time together that is sweet. \\n\r\nThirdly, the anime acknowledges the difficulty of forming a relationship. Many times, we have seen that two characters who aren't lover, aren't lovers, aren\u2019t lovers and bang suddenly, lovers, lovers, lovers. Toradora acknowledges how untrue that really is. The anime depicts many aspects of what most people would have gone through during high school/any period of their life, liking someone but not knowing if the other person feels the same way or not knowing how to break it to them saying that you like them. Of course then you would try many different methods to try (emphasis on try) to tell them but most of the methods would end in disaster and your embarrassment; the anime depict these as well to horrific accuracy. \\n\r\nI will stop myself here for now, but you get the idea. \\n\r\nSo the story is definitely a good one (such an understatement) and I feel like most people that want to watch it will enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\nOkay here\u2019s the TL;DR section for those who can\u2019t be bothered.\\n\\n\r\nArt and animation: \\n\r\nGood mostly, Great the rest. The characters have the best facial expressions.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack and voice: \\n\r\nMusic is catchy, emotional and played at the right times. The music significantly enhances the emotional events that you\u2019ll experiencing. OPs and EDs are nice too. Voice acting is top notch.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\r\nDeep, multi-dimensional, and developed really well from start to finish. Each of them has more than meets the eye and the supporting characters aren\u2019t left out either. \\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nRomcom by name but nothing standard. The story goes deep to explore many ideas about love and its meaning whilst giving you a lovely complex and developing storyline.\\n\r\nTL;DR over, continue to read the next sections.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nWell, I gave it a 10/10 for a reason.\\n\r\nAlthough I would say one thing, if you don\u2019t like tsunderes at all, like you can\u2019t tolerate any sort of tsun and practically allergic and would require significant medical attention upon seeing anything tsun, I would suggest you take a step back and watch a girl with autism (I\u2019m serious) and her beautiful love story in Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo. \\n\r\nBut if you aren\u2019t the sort of person I\u2019ve described above, I would suggest you give it a go at least. If you make it to episode 10 and don\u2019t like what you see, then I can\u2019t blame you for dropping it.\\n\r\nIf you are concerned about the tsundere, don\u2019t be. The trope is what you can describe as tsundere, but it\u2019s nothing like what you\u2019ve seen before, it\u2019s not repetitive and it adds to the story development as well as the character development. (The tsundere\u2019s voice actor is really famous for her work, so that\u2019s always reassuring.)\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nToradora is one of those animes you watch, you laugh, you cry, you laugh again, you smile and you remember. I have to say it\u2019s something special not just as a romcom but as an anime in general. And oh my the ending.\\n\\n\r\nAppendix A:\\n\r\nThank you for reading everything I have to say, hopefully I have convinced you to watch the anime. Hopefully you found this review useful and happy viewing!\\n\r\n[See Appendix B for what to do after you finish the anime]\\n\\n\r\nAppendix B:\\n\r\nOkay so if you are here I will assume you have finished the entire series at least once. Here are a couple of things I would recommend you doing if you wish to see more Toradora; \\n\r\n0 \u2013 There\u2019s an OVA, about bento lunches, so go ahead (#NotShokugekiNoSoma). Includes more character development! Yay!\\n\r\n1 \u2013 Didn\u2019t like the ending of the anime? Want to ship the MC with one of the other girls? You can do that with the \u201cToradora! Portable\u201d PSP game. You can purchase the game off Amazon and use either a PSP or an emulator to play it.\\n\r\n2 \u2013 Want to see the source material? Toradora is an adaptation of a light novel series, so you can always check those out if you want to see the story in its original detail, also there\u2019s a manga too so, more money to spend!\\n\r\n3 \u2013 If you haven\u2019t brought the OST, I would suggest doing so, since the music is varied, fun, and emotional, just like the anime.\\n\r\n4 \u2013 See Appendix C if finished all of the above.\\n\\n\r\nAppendix C:\\n\r\nOkay no more material on the actual story and such, but merch is still a thing! Posters to stickers to figurines to plushies to body pillows, if you want to splurge then that\u2019s what you could do!\\n\r\nIf you are really desperate for more story, fan fiction is the next best thing I\u2019m afraid.\\n\r\n(Doujins too if you are into that)\\n",

As a case in point, even midway through, I wasn\u2019t sure what all the hubbub about the show was about. Now, however I fully understand why the show has captured the hearts of so many.\r\nAs I touched upon before, Toradora! is a very well-received anime. From what I\u2019ve seen, it\u2019s regarded as one of the best romance anime. It is the favorite anime of many. This in and of itself could serve as a draw to the series. If you want to be inthe conversation in regards to anime, after watching Toradora!, you\u2019ll be sure to find someone to discuss it with.\\n\\n\r\nToradora! Follows Ryuuji Takasu -- a first-year high schooler who\u2019s ostracized due to his frightening appearance -- and Taiga Aisaka -- a girl whose extremely short stature belies fiery and violent attitude. Their paths cross when Ryuuji inadvertently discovers a love letter from Taiga, causing her to blackmail him into helping her win the affections of her crush. \\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s a very simple synopsis, but I don\u2019t really want to give away too much. \\n\\n\r\nToradora! has a very colorful cast of characters, and I\u2019m pleased to say they\u2019re a joy to watch. In particular, I love Ryuuji and Kitamura just due to how nice they are. For Toradora! I watched the Japanese audio version, and all the seiyuu sound fantastic, lending a lot of emotion and character to their roles. I don\u2019t exaggerate when I say that every main character has hidden depths that allow you to appreciate them more. All of their actions make sense and they have reasons for some of their more bizarre and egregious traits. Most importantly, they grow as people.\\n\\n\r\nYou should keep this in mind, because the show certainly might not seem like its anything more than surface level at first.\\n\\n\r\nMost of my marks against Toradora! are at the beginning, specifically the first four episodes or so. Toradora! is an amazing ride, but it takes a bit to leave the station, so to speak. The main problem for me lies in the fact that Taiga, at least initially, is a very hard character to love. Bear in mind that I generally loathe characters of the tsundere archetype and Taiga may as well be the queen. Violent, spiteful, load, and possessing a hair-trigger temper, Taiga is the epitome of the trope. And while she\u2019s multi-faceted, she gets better, and she has a reason for the way she acts, it doesn\u2019t watching her any easier. She proved particular aggravating to me because I had to watch her abuse the mild-mannered Ryuuji and see him warm up to her despite her doing nothing to deserve his kindness.\\n\\n\r\nEven ignoring Taiga, I just didn\u2019t find the first few episodes special. The jokes aren\u2019t that funny and it just seems like your standard romcom. If I hadn\u2019t watched the first eight episodes in one go, I might have dropped the series. I would have been missing out on a terrific series, but in my defense, I wouldn\u2019t have known better. It\u2019s a show\u2019s job to hook watchers in early on, and Toradora! unfortunately doesn\u2019t do that well, in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nToradora! does reward the faithful for staying however, and it\u2019s all uphill from there. I know one of the most ridiculous things to say when recommending a show to someone is \u201coh, just keep watching, it gets better! I swear.\u201d For one, it forces new viewers to place their faith in a show despite evidence that its sub-par. With me acknowledging how crazy I sound, please, please believe me when I say the show gets better. It gets amazing. Come the second third of the show, all the jokes land, the animation becomes more fluid as J.C. Staff hits its stride, and serious elements are abound. \\n\\n\r\nThe final third of the series, signified by a change in OP and ED, is easily the best portion of the show. It\u2019s definitely more dramatic than the rest of the series, but the shift isn\u2019t jarring. The series gradually moves from comedic to more serious and romantic elements, and I was impressed by how natural it felt. Given the characters I saw at the beginning, I was surprised by how real everyone felt and how naturally the romance progressed.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is memorable and fits each scene well.\\n\\n\r\nHindsight is 20/20, so getting through the beginning will doubtlessly be easier upon a rewatch. As a bonus incentive to watch it again, Toradora! features a lot of foreshadowing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Toradora! Is a show that I find a bit hard to recommend. It takes quite a while to hit its stride, but once it does, its all smooth sailing until a great finish. This unassuming romcom is like an onion - it has layers, and it just might make you cry. The art is great, the zany characters will make you laugh, and the connections that the characters forge will warm your heart. I\u2019m really grateful that I got to watch such a heartwarming anime during the holiday season. At first I wasn\u2019t sure what the fuss was about -- it just seemed like your typical anime. Toradora! still isn\u2019t perfect, but there\u2019s something about it that made me smile. And that\u2019s good enough in my book.\\n\\n\r\nNow if you excuse me, in Preparation for curing my Silky Heart, I must eat an Orange sprinkled with Vanilla Salt.\\n\\n\r\n(Yes, I know the name\u2019s Pre-Perade, but I don\u2019t know how to fit that into a sentence, sue me.)\\n\\n\r\n80/100\\n\\n\r\nB-\\n",

            "content": "Despite the popular consensus , Toradora! is not a romance anime. Allow me to explain.\r\nIn a standard romance anime, the two romantic leads are generally supported by a secondary cast whose sole purpose is to act as cheerleaders for the leads and push them together. That isn't the case here, as all of the supporting cast have their own motives and reasons to exist within the story.\r\nRyuji and Taiga, as the romantic leads, aren't really romantic leads in the usual sense. The story isn't demanding they pair up as in most romantic series; they, too, have motivations outside of being a couple.  As aconsequence, the entire cast is a group of likable characters, even though one or two take some time becoming likable.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is quite well done, even though the quality drops at certain points. This only happens rarely, but it's hard to miss.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is really good, with a good opening song for the first half of the series. At certain points, when \"Lost my Pieces\" plays (and you'll know when you hear it), expect feels.\\n\\n\r\nThe english dub (I haven't personally heard the sub), is one of the finest in all of anime (Cassandra Morris is wonderful as Taiga), and as such deserves to heard by as many people as possible.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Toradora! is very enjoyable, with a lot of humour throughout and a good\\n\r\ncast of characters.",

            "content": "After watching a lot of Romantic Comedy that always have a stupid male protagonist, annoying tsundere girl,and 1 million girls easily falling in love with the protagonist. I have finally found a great Rom-Com anime which doesn't have most of the cliches that I listed above. It's not a perfect Rom-Com anime but it's very close to being a perfect one. \r\n(There will be some SPOILERS in my review)\r\n[Story]: (7/10) (SPOILERS)\r\nThe story is basically simple. Ryuuji goes to school, bumps into a girl, this girl hates his guts, he gains feeling for him later on in the series then you pretty much know what's goingto happen and who the male protagonist is going to end up with.\\n\r\nThe story in my opinion, is good but not great. The show uses comedy most of the times to escape the weak plot and I guess it worked. However, the plot became  somewhat stronger in the last 5 or 6 episodes of the series. By the way, I'm not saying that the show had a stupid plot. I just thought it was weak. There were some strong plot but there aren't a lot. The show still has a good story but not the very best. \\n\\n\r\nUggh, the melodramatic moments. It just became annoying. I'm not saying all dramatic moments were annoying but there are scenes that I found annoying like Minori and Ami fighting or where Yuusaka broke down in a state of depression. How about that scene where Taiga (or was it Ryuuji who said that) said \"let's get married\" out of the water(They were in the water at this scene so no pun intended). I literally facepalmed so hard. Dramatic moments is not really the show's strength to begin with. The comedy does make up for the weak(but good) plot and horrendous dramatic moments. This is, by far, one of the funniest animes I have ever seen. It doesn't always resort to cheap violent moments just to make us laugh because the show also uses other tactics to make the viewers laugh.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing of the show is kind of slow but that didn't really bother me because I'm used to slow story pacing anime. If you make it past the 20 episodes then the last 5 episodes will be rewarding. \\n\r\nThe series ended on a satisfying note. I'm not saying it's a great ending but it's at least satisfying to me. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]: (8/10)\\n\r\nThe animation is beautiful and colorful but wasn't expecting better since this is from J.C Staff. The character designs are well drawn and they also look glorious. The character motions are ok and the \"girl fight scenes\" are fluid. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Sound]: (9/10)\\n\r\nI absolutely love the soundtrack for this show. The background themes fit so well with the \"slice of life\" and \"rom-com\" theme. There are 2 OP and 2 ED used for this show. I thought the 1st OP is ok but the 2nd opening is better. I can't give out my thoughts on the ED since I just skip them and watch the preview. I watched the show in Eng. Dub so I'm going to give my thoughts on the English VA. They all did a terrific job with their characters and their voice fitted so well. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Characters]: (9.5/10)\\n\r\nOhh, the characters. One of the show's main strong point. This is one of the reasons why I love this show. The character's are not stereotyped and they don't usually play their tropes at all. In other words, their actions are somewhat unpredictable.\\n\r\nThe main protagonist of the show, Ryuuji, is not your typical annoying brain-dead main protagonist that you see mostly in Rom-Coms today. He's actually a likable character with likable personalities and he's also smart (Thank God). Taiga, a likable tsundere character of the show, may be annoying at the start but she starts to show her redeeming qualities later in the series. Kitamura, a friend of Ryuuji. At first, I thought that Kitamura is just going to be thrown aside while Ryuuji gets all the girls but thank god that didn't happen. The show sometimes focuses on him, giving him a character development. Minori, a cheerful high school girl. What I like about her is even though she's going through tough times, she faces it and gets through it instead of complaining. I wanted to save Ami for last because she's now one of my favorite characters. Ami is a teenage modelling girl that transferred to Ryuuji's school for reasons that I don't want to list because of spoilers. One of the reasons why the show is funny is because of Ami. She makes up 80% of the show's comedy.(I came up with this percentage and is not accurate). Hell, she even points out the cheesy drama moments that these characters are going through and she likes to break her trope a lot. \\n\\n\r\nAll of the characters got a character development. Even the side cast. Well, not a lot but still. They didn't get thrown aside like some useless characters. As you watch the show, you'll see how the characters changed from the start of the series to the end of the series. Especially Ryuuji, Taiga.....You know what? All the main characters changed from start to end. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]: (10/10)\\n\r\nEasily a perfect score from me. I enjoyed this show from start to finish. The jokes weren't being re-used, the characters are likable, the show is hilarious as hell. What more do you need? \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[OVERALL]: (9/10)\\n\r\nThis is one of, if not, the best Romantic Comedy Anime out there. While the show does suffer from melodramatic moments, the show also has a lot of great moments like a good story, a new and fleshed out characters, likable characters, and extreme hilarious moments. The show is obviously not for everyone so if you're not a fan of Rom-Com anime or you don't have a sense of humor then don't watch this show. If you're one of the above then give this show a try and I'm positive that you'll fall in love with the show, no pun intended. \\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+Good story\\n\r\n+Great Animation\\n\r\n+Great Soundtrack\\n\r\n+A lot of funny moments\\n\r\n+Jokes aren't re-used\\n\r\n+Likable fleshed out characters with great character development\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Slow pacing\\n\r\n-Melodramatic moments\\n",

Sometimes they fall in love instantly and there would a bunch of problems at once to stop their love, almost Romeo and Juliet-esque. But Toradora is a breath of fresh air in the this world of anime and manga. \r\nBefore watching this show, I was bored and hoping for a new anime. Something that would make me cry, \"OMG this is awesome!\" To cry of sadness and laugh so much that my stomach hurt like hell. This anime did just that.\r\nToradora is about your typical story,guy likes a girl. but there is a twist, the guy is scared of the girl he likes, so he goes to her best friend to try get her to like him. sure that seems to work, except the girl's friend is very sly and gives a condition if she would help him, to help her get to his best friend. And that agreement, they go off and try to do that plan... all in while of hilarity and crazy friends. xD\\n\\n\r\nBut anyways, now to business.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: I think I incorporated that in my intro. like I said, a breath of fresh air to the shojo genre. crazy things and hilarity to resume all over the show, that made it awesome to watch and love.\\n\\n\r\nArt: loved it. I loved the background and color, mostly the action parts. That girl could fight...\\n\\n\r\nSound: I loved the Opening songs and ending so much I have them in my Zune. I even liked the song sang during the Christmas episode.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters are amazing. characters jeopardizing the plans and typical high school things. All the while of hilarity of crazy characters and events. The development is quite well shown by the end of the show. The romance between the main characters were well shown in the progress and at the end.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: If there was a movie or another season or anything surrounding it, I would go to the ends of the world to see it... That is how much I enjoyed seeing the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\\n\r\nToradora is the most hilarious anime I ever seen, there were so many times in that anime that I felt like I was about to die laughing. So guess what, I'm going to watch this again.\\n\\n\r\nRatings:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\r\nArt:10\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nCharacter 10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10 and infinity\\n\r\nOverall: 10!!!!",

            "content": "What is it that draws one towards the most unlikely of relationships?  Is it the \"underdog\" qualities, where one desires to see the more \"unfortunate\" character have something wonderful happen to him/her?  Or would it be more along the lines that a \"perfect\" couple is just plain boring and those unlikely pairs are just fantastic to watch, making for an amazing story?\r\nToradora introduces itself into the romantic comedy genre in a method where the two unlikely characters start off by liking the other's best friend.  However, the progress of each character with their personal love interest proves to be both entertaining andrelatable.  The story begins with Ryuuji Takasu accidentally finding the confession letter of Taiga Aisaka, intended to be given to Yuusaku Kitamura (Ryuuji's best friend).  Taiga storms Ryuuji's room with a wooden sword, but Ryuuji reveals that he has a huge crush on Minori Kusheida (Taiga's best friend).  Both decide to help each other in this odd little love square, giving way to hilarity, mischief, drama and of course, romance.  Combine that with the rest of a fantastic cast of characters and the result is a romantic-comedy quite unlike any other I have seen.  \\n\\n\r\nWhen I began watching Toradora (just a month or so after its initial release), I soon caught up with the airing date and was checking daily for the subbed version's release.  That in itself should give away just how much I came to enjoy this wonderful show.  Typically I like to review in a very systematic process; giving individual scores to each category and totaling them up to give an overall score out of 50.  But I feel that if I left it at that, I would be leaving a lot untold about this great show.  So I will give a follow up after my categorical review, for those of you who want a synopsis of my review, or just the \"meat\" and the bottom line.\\n\\n\r\n** STORY 10/10 **    \\n\r\nIt takes several things to make a phenomenal story, such as an intriguing plot-line, a believable setting, characters and of course, conflict.  Sometimes, these components come together in such a way as to leave a tale that is worthy of being told and retold.  Toradora presents itself as one of these such tales, having all the workings of becoming one of my favorite stories.  Establishing itself as a school-slice-of-life with romantic, comedic and dramatic elements, the story progresses with quite a satisfying pace (save the last 2 episodes, 24 particularly, but that's another discussion entirely) and leaves the viewer desiring to know what happens next.  Each element of the story seems to be quite well balanced; comedic relief comes into play after a dramatic or tense moment to keep a light-hearted mood, the romance never seems too sappy or unrealistic (I'm sure you've seen those shows where the guy is surrounded by women who SOMEHOW just adore him without even knowing him) and generally speaking, each episode is truly enjoyable from start to finish.  As for the driving factors in the story's progression, the conflicts that show up are mostly internal, character-driven problems; those that you would expect in any typical classroom setting.  Ryuuji's single mom, Taiga's lack of parents even present in her life and the mere fact that their rooms are right next to each other give rise to many of the story's great problems and triumphs alike.  This has been, by far, one of my favorite, realistic story lines I've ever seen.  There were so many times that I felt like I could relate to any number of the characters that it felt as if I was watching a story based loosely on my own personal life.  \\n\\n\r\n** ART  9/10 **\\n\r\nNow that an incredible story has been etched out and realized, what is the most efficient way to portray the events?  This is where the art comes in, as the medium in which the writers \"show\" how the story unfolds.  Ryuuji, with his \"scary, delinquent eyes\" is drawn really well.  Taiga is so cute throughout, Ami is pretty darn hot, and even the rest of the characters have their own unique appearance that lends to the believability of their personalities.  Each scene looks to be pretty well thought out and plenty of attention was paid to the details.  For the most part, art is one category that is hard to put words to, and instead must be experienced first-hand.\\n\\n\r\n** SOUND 9/10 **\\n\r\nAnother key component to presenting the story is the sound department, including all the music, ambiance, object noises and voice cast.  Music wise, there's not much to say; the opening/ending themes are interesting, nothing to write home about, but can't really complain either.  During the show there's appropriate use of background melodies, but again, I was never floored by a scene because of some fantastic music.  Ambiance is spot on, many times a busy street sounds like one, the noise of cooking food, the sound of a street all sound pretty darn realistic and blend in smoothly.  Every object noise sounds like a live-sampled sound, in decent quality.  Doors, windows, footsteps even all sound great.  But the thing that pushes my score up to a 9/10 is the amazing voice-cast.  Each character is acted out incredibly well; emotions sound real, personalities even show up in the voices.  Again, sound is something that is hard to describe but must be heard and experienced.\\n\\n\r\n** CHARACTER 10/10 **\\n\r\nIf there were a category in which I could weight the score heavier, this would be it.  Characters are what sell an anime to me, along with the story.  I have a hard time watching shows in which the characters are hollow or empty, boring, or otherwise lack anything worth mentioning.  That being said, each an every character blew me away.  There doesn't ever seem to be a \"filler\" character; each one lends their part to the overall story and just \"fits.\"  I almost guarantee you will find a character in which you relate to in some form.  Each one is well thought out, well planned and scripted extremely well.  Towards the end of the anime, lines from each character seem to fit with the personality they represent.  Several \"Yeah, you would do that\" moments appear, as the main characters are portrayed so well that you feel like you know them personally after a few episodes.  \\n\\n\r\n** ENJOYMENT 10/10 **\\n\r\nOf all the categories I review, this area should be taken with the biggest grain of salt.  What I find awesome, someone else may find horrible.  \\n\r\nSo, with that, I give this category a 10, simply because I liked spending the time watching this show.  I also began waiting (often times very impatiently) for the next episode to be released and subbed, immediately downloading and watching it (even if it was 4 in the morning).  After episode 16 (where I caught up with the airing date) I began to watch each episode twice; once on the release date (usually a Thursday night for me) and again on the following Thursday before the next one aired, just to catch myself up with the story.  I don't regret it one bit, I laughed, then laughed again when I saw it again, knowing it was coming.  I will most likely be watching this again in a few months time, just because it was that good.  Also, the ending is very satisfying.  I have seen many an anime ending that was very cliche or just plain... stupid.  Not so with Toradora.  I felt good after watching it; it really resolved itself and finished off strong.  (Last episode... freaking awesome scene in it... you know which one I'm talking about, or you will know when you see it).  \\n\\n\r\n** OVERALL 48/50 **\\n\r\nA near flawless score from me, with art and sound being the only non-10 scores.  This is definitely one of my top-10 animes now.  Sure, several things could have made it better, but may have also taken away value from other aspects of the show.  \\n\\n\r\n***** BOTTOM LINE *****  \\n\r\nToradora is a very cute and enjoyable romantic-comedy, slice-of-life anime that is definitely a must see.  With a very satisfying and smooth pacing, there aren't too many dull moments, making this show very good for either a marathon viewing, or a slow, one-episode-a-week pace.  The incredible cast of characters are truly what brings life to this anime, giving a realistic and highly relatable experience.  Don't hesitate to spend the time watching all 25 episodes; you won't be disappointed!",

            "content": "This review contains spoilers. Read at your own risk.\r\n           Toradora is often a staple for the Rom/com genre.  Considered endearing and full of life. I couldn't disagree more. With the obligatory hyperbole out of the way I may dive in deeper.\r\nToradora begins on the hope that you would sympathize with the protagonist. Due to the fact that he has unusual eyes, the lead is distrusted and feared by those who don't know him. An attempt to distinguish from the world it seems. However it did little for me. Thelead is the dreaded character with just about no character. Dull and selfless. He agrees to help the Female lead even after: she punches him in the school halls, attacks him in a classroom and tries to steal his school bags, then attempts to murder him in his residence. All in the first episode of course. After the assault subsides she explains how tsundere she is and misplaced a love letter in his bag. However our very own Sherlock Holmes learns how the protagonist is interested in her own best friend.  A rather neat arrangement.  Females lead's target, henceforth known as friend 1, spends only token time with his alleged close friend and is a stock and barrel bore. Friend 2 (Friend of Female lead) is the classic happy go lucky joy bringing character, who as usual takes a 180 and becomes the self loathing rut, who only derides herself and refuses all others company. Insert one-sided characters, romance swap, excessive melodrama, and you have the story of Toradora happy birthday. I will say however the model girl is the only dynamic character and was bearable to watch. She is unfortunately regulated to a minor third wheel character near the shows end. \\n\\n\r\n     The art was decent enough. I do greatly dislike the design of the female lead however. The Op and outros, while not memorable were decent enough, you could say they were a nice break from the show itself.\\n\\n\r\n     All in all I would recommend the show, not due to any value or enjoyment but because it is a case study for overused tropes native to the rom/com genre. At best an anime to get yourself into anime, a frequent viewer of the genre should be able to point put it's flaws. Not counting any nostalgia they may have attached to the show.",

It begins and follows upon the stories of Takasu Ryuuji, once thought of as a delinquent because of stereotypism (his eyes look criminal comparedto those of his fellow classmates), Aisaka \"Palmtop Tiger\" Taiga, a diminutive tactless girl who ends up having their lives entangled because of a simple accident of Ryuuji discovering her obsession and her love of Kitamura, a fellow classmate and Takasu's best friend.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, Toradora draws you to it, sucks you in, so much so that you begin to think of your life with regards to the events of the series itself. As the series unfolds and the feelings each character has of each other develops, you can't help but feel an attachment to each of their individual stories. A scratch in this character here or that character there echoes into your own psyche. That powerful a series and that powerful a genre doesn't hold fit for me because it serves to give you a 'slice of life' through who the characters are and what they become. \\n\\n\r\nIn essence, I fell in love with the characters precisely because of their humanity, their vulnerability and their honest to goodness regard for their fellow classmates.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, this series is a masterpiece and is very well recommended.",

Class rearrangements on his second high school year put him together with his best friend, Yusaku Kitamura, and his hidden crush, Minori Kushieda. Along with these two comes Kushieda'sbest friend, Taiga Aisaka. Her delicate appearance contrasts with her brutal personality. Secretly in love with Kitamura, Taiga agrees to help Ryuji with his love interest as long as he helps her get closer to hers. -ANN\\n\\n\r\nshort story- this anime is about two high school kids trying to hook each other up with each others best friend.\\n\\n\r\nThoughts\\n\\n\r\n                                                  characters\\n\\n\r\ncons- At first glance this anime looks to be filled with a cast of cliche characters. Minori is your seemingly cliche strange, energetic, air-head sports freak. Taiga appears to ba a textbook \"Shana\" moe B.A. with a hidden cute/soft side. I could go on... but I think you get the point.\\n\\n\r\npros- In the first half of this anime it seemed as if the cast was randomly thrown together and then the writers were just praying for the best. but right around the half way point or so I noticed something was up. take Minori for example. She was introduced as a strange, energetic, air-head sports freak; but somewhere along the road in the anime she began to change to totally contrast how she was portrayed at the start of the anime. Why would you almost completely change a character halfway through an anime of this length? The answer came in a later episode that explained why she acts the way she does. The point is that the authors didn't just randomly come up with and change the cast on some whim or because it was being used as some plot device. The characters were well thought through, defined, and well explained the anime. \\n\r\n- Individuality the characters are not all that; but when you put this cast of sundry characters together; that is when they really shine.\\n\r\n- On another note I really liked the fact that A: that the Male lead actual has a personality. and B: that the authors understand how to use the supporting characters.\\n\\n\\n\r\n                                                     Story\\n\r\ncons- to be perfectly honest I didn't really like all the cliche fillerish School comedy stuff they did in the first half. I think if they did it with more of a slice of life POV it wouldn't have thrown some of us for a loop like it did when it got more slice-of-life/drama at the end. I think the general Idea was spot on of trying to have fillerish episodes that slowly get the viewer attached and cleverly and narrowly avoiding the \"hinted\" eventually ending. I just didn't think that the way they presented it was the most successful way to have it played out.\\n\\n\r\npros- The authors almost completely maxed this story out. They did a very good job of keeping the pace feel right on for and when the situation called for(meaning It didn't feel rushed and I wasn't bored at any point). \\n\r\n- They used the cast of characters to build up this fairly simple drama plot into something awesome. \\n\\n\\n\r\n                                             comedy\\n\r\ncons- not gonna lie, that pet bird Ryuji has is one of the biggest fails of comic relief I've ever seen......\\n\\n\r\npros- I found myself laughing at multiple points in the anime. \\n\\n\\n\r\n                                          sound/music\\n\r\n- Pretty good OP/ED.\\n\r\n- The background music was well placed \\n\r\n- Most emotional moments that were accompanied by some sort of music did a great job of multiplying the moment.\\n\\n\r\nanimation \\n\r\n- minor glitches here and there but unless you knew what to look for or were looking hard for them they're not apparent.\\n\r\n- It's J.C. staff animation so expect that level of animation + some\\n\r\n- one of the best kiss scenes I've ever seen in any visual medium...... Ever.\\n\\n\r\n                                 Overall/closing thoughts\\n\r\ntoradora takes you on a ride of classic high school comedy/drama and somehow takes you into the genre of Romance/slice-of-life. This mix of humor, craziness, confusion, awesomeness, drama(ness) and romance makes Toradora! truly standout in nowadays Romance genre. \\n\\n\r\nclosing ratings\\n\r\nplot/story: 9\\n\r\ncharacters: 9\\n\r\nanimation: 9\\n\r\nsound: 8\\n\r\nX-factor: 10\\n\r\noverall: 9\\n\\n\r\nAuthors note: I usually don't give anime such high ratings, but I do praise when its deserved.

It's not something that you can put on a high pedastoll, love comes from the most unlikely of places, it can even be starring you right in the face.\r\nFor those of you who are dissapointed about the ending, it is basically said in the TITLE of the series itself. Toradora stands for Dragon X Taiga which are the meanings behind Ryuuji and Tagai's names. Plus as well if you go and look at all the hints from the two birds on the pole whenthey are together or when they are not together to the fact that they can have a natrual conversation with each other and you can see how their relationship develops. Also look at how they act around each other compared to when they are around their crushes and in the beach house episode Taiga rubs Ryujji's back with her feet without either of them caring about it, plus she saids that when she is around Ryuuji it's like so what. To me that is more of a sign of love then anything else and the fact that they don't try to hide their true selves from each other at any point. To me that is the signs of true love and that's what I took away from Toardora. The idea that for it to be true love is that it has to be with someone you are completley comfortable and loves you for who are and not what you are trying to be or what others think of you.\\n\\n\r\nTo me like I said before Toaradora gets what a romantic comedy is suppose to be about. The characters, the relationships and showing a natrual progression of a relationship.",

The end was a bit rushed and could have used even one or two more episodes to really polish it out. Still good. However I feel the ending could have more... depth with the characters. More of a relationship rather than how the show ended off after the credits.\r\nBeing in a relationshipand experiencing those first times is what makes it exciting and that's really all the story needs to be a 10/10 for me.\\n\\n\r\nI try not to be overly critical nor fanboy ignorant. The sound was decent, I liked Lost my Pieces and Kotori no Etude. The characters are enjoyable and don't hit spot on with the usual stereotypes.\\n\\n\r\nEven Taiga has development about why she is a Tsundere. It makes sense, rather than that just being her personality all the time, she changes. I personally don't mind dere characters, if they're used right and still develop. The animation was nothing special to me. It did its job.\\n\\n\r\nI think you'll like Toradora! even if you're not fully into RomComs. I'm not. I don't mind romance when it's done well.

Let me get this out of the way i love Tsundere females character leads and Aisaka, Taiga ticks all the boxes for me.Taiga is one of the funniest female characters iv seen, her interaction with the male lead Takasu, Ryuuji in some cases are just unbelievably funnyand always kept you on your toes when watching this show. Takasu, Ryuuji character is just parallels with Taiga fantastically and the two just jel really well together to make for some really funny situations. Kushieda, Minori the best friend of Taiga is another really different funny character with a unique personalty that is always entertaining to watch and that feeling is consistent though out.  Yuusaku \"Maruo\" Kitamura, has some real interesting parts in the show and leads a little independent sub plot at times that was really entertaining to watch and didn't feel as if it was getting in the way of the main plot. Kawashima, Ami, the beautiful popular student that is always at ends with Taiga and from the start is sort of shown to be the 'bad guy' but as time goes out you start to feel attracted even to her as a lead character.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum up my view, This show pulled me and didn't let go till i finished watching it and even then i wanted more, they developed all the characters to the point at which i cared about them all and sorta wanted them all to end happy. Should you watch this show ? YES YES YES, like i said it isnt anything really new but it is still really well written and really entertaining to watch for me its a most. GO WATCH IT :P \\n\\n\r\nHope my review was helpful\\n\r\nMurphy   \\n",

It's not a typical romance, yet so romantic... At first I liked it just for the art and realy interesting characters. The story was kindapredictable, so I was just waiting for the expected scene, when they finally get what they want. And then - everything changed. I realy hate when producers ruin the anime, that had such a great begining, but this time anime becomes better and better with every episode.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the scene, the \"final scene\", that actually is not in the end, but it's when they kiss, is also not predictable, not cheesy, realy original, romantic, simple maybe, but unforgettable somehow.... for that just one scene watching every single episode - worth it!:))",

The character development is outstanding, the plot is monumental it's overwhelming with you wanting more and more, heck even the unnecessary episodes are just as entertaining. The animation is fresh, clean, and serene the dialogue is detailed and well played, as you will never get lost no matter how tired you are from watching this anime all day and night. You'll always be looking for more Toradora, each episode is like eating something new, you'll never knowhow it tastes until you finish it. I gotta say, it's short, romantic, comedic, dramatic all in the same. Toradora has won 10/10 OUTSTANDING ON EVERYTHING and earns my seal of approval, meaning it's a MUST WATCH!",

If you've read or watch any Japanese school romance-type anime, novels, or manga then you'll be able to guess what happens by about episode 4.  That was the main let-down about this show since it had very few if any original or novel story elements that set it apart.  By about episode 20 I was struggling to watch the rest of the show since by this point there, was no surprises, or plot twists that I wasn't anticipating.  \r\nThe characters were overall quite interesting, butjust as how the story falls short on originality, the characters do as well.  Almost all of the elements of the characters have been done before on other anime's and each of the characters themselves aren't that deep. That said, the main character Ryuuji, and the palmtop tiger were the most enjoyable to watch and see them interact.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall this show was fun to watch with plenty of comedy elements that will keep you laughing even if the plot is predictable.",

            "content": "Now before marking this as unhelpful cause of my really low mark, hear me out. I like Toradora, It's a good anime, just.. there is some stuff that bugs me about it. Anyway, on with the review : \r\nStory 7/10 : So the story revolves around 2 characters, Aisaka Taiga, and Takasu Ryuuji, who both have a crush, Ryuuji's crush being Kushieda Minori and Taiga's being Kitamura Yuukasu. And so, after one encounter, begins their journey of helping each other to get their crush to like them. The story is well paced, and the originality is there, [POTENTIAL SPOILER] having a \"love square\" instead ofa triangle. The story is just generally well presented, nothing much to say here.\\n\\n\r\n[SPOILER RANT-ISH EXPLANATION] : Now the reasons why I hate it. [SPOILER, DON'T READ THIS IF YOU DON'T WANT SPOILERS, SERIOUSLY] In the last episode the love between Ryuuji and Taiga develops even more. Their crushes are pretty much ok with them being together, they even kiss. Then Taiga runs away, for no reason at all (maybe something philosophical) and leaves this \"Harem\"-esque ending. The story was built up, but then crashed down and left a cliffhanger. Yes I am salty about the ending, and that's my reason for a lower mark.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10 :  Nothing particular or Revolutionary here. The art is good however.  \\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10 : The voice acting, as always is good. Taiga's voice is perfect for her character, same for all the other characters. The openings is what made this mark lower. They are, well, meh. I do not like them that much, I found myself just skipping them each time.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 6/10 : This is where, IN MY OPINION, this anime lacks. The only well done character is Taiga, being not a straight Tsundere, but a different kind, only having the violent side of a Tsundere. The rest however... not as good. Ryuuji : Classical \"badass\" MC (one of the other better done characters), really nothing special for him. Yasuko : the \"young mother\", I really felt weird about her, for example how is she that young if ryuuji is like 16. Kushieda : Classical tomboy with feelings, this character seemed poorly executed, as instead of character progression she had a complete change. \\n\r\nKitamura : The popular guy of the class, all the girls are his. He also was poorly executed, going from the popular guy to something strange in between. I can't really explain why he is poorly executed. Ami : I have no idea what this character is supposed to be. The popular idol girl? The weak inside girl? The mature person to look up to? She seemed to have too many purposes, thus making her bad. I could go on but it's pretty much the same everywhere. The anime would be better if the characters would be better developed.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 6/10 : Again, because of the last episode, I now dislike this anime. It was good to watch, but I kept questioning myself about the characters. Now this is purely my mark, you may like it, I don't.\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 6/10 This is not a bad 6. The anime was overall ok, with a bit of flaws. But these little flaws really ruined the anime for me. This anime is actually really good according to to other people, this is plainly my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nSorry for making this a rant-ish review.",

            "content": "School life crushes. Back then for some you were either too shy to talk to them or no matter how hard you tried thing didn't go to plan. Others however manage to catch them. But regardless of the outcome and the happiness of now, one always looks back and smiles at them self at the memories their youth brought them.\r\nToradora has a story that is somewhat easy to predict at most points and at other times adds a small twist that's just enough to poke at your feels. However they story is somewhat flat for the large portion of the anime. It starts and risessteady for the first few but then it pans out when all the characters are introduced and despite the little wavers it has at points, it still resolves in the same outcomes an episode or two later. It's not until the last quarter of the anime that the story really peaks up again and the line between romance and comedy becomes more apparent\\n\\n\r\nStyle of art could not be any more generic. The only things that stand out is the emotion and colour they give the faces when they express large amounts of affection and grief as well as the art used inside western style houses. Tones and gradients are well used to depict the scenery and really adds to the emotion of some moments while other times basic uses means it wouldn't matter the time of day, the character atmosphere would remain the same.\\n\\n\r\nSound works hand in hand with the art style in some areas and others, excels the scenes mood. While used mostly to add a scene of feel so the viewer has a bit more sense of emotion, other times it gives the scene the much need oomph to take a decent scene, into an interesting development, making you want to know where the anime is going.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development leaves you high and dry for the longest part of the anime. It plays through the past as a heavy need to know and only speaks of it, if the situation needs it. This leaves a lot of questions about the characters pasts. Then there's development within themselves which is actually well played out. While the story plays at a flat pace, everything that happens with the characters is reminisced upon when the latter part of the anime comes along and really shows just how far everyone has come with not only each others feelings, but how they truly feel about them selves\\n\\n\r\nThis leads to the enjoyment factor. It's a bit of an up and down ride as you find yourself bored at times but either a comedic scene that lasts or a dramatic addition keeps your interest peaked. Towards the end however it builds up on both feels and romance but it fails to juggle them both It end up having to drop one, so it goes full romance at a key point, leaving you expecting heavy feels but it does not deliver.",

The story is amazing, and there's no filler or anything like that in the show. The art and sound is really good, but that only compliments the amazing story of Toradora. I think what really makes Toradora memorable though are the realistic characters, who aren't completely perfect which makes them seem so much more realistic and relatable to.There are unlikable and likable characters that don't remain so, which shows that the character development in this show is very good. Even characters who's personalities I had hated added much to the show by their interactions and chemistry with other characters. Overall Toradora! is an amazing show, and it's my favourite romcom anime although I haven't seen many of that genre.",

            "content": "So Toradora a story about some tall dude who thanks to his genes has a menacing look and people are afraid of him. Oh wait on Ep 2 they already get rid of that plot point and they sometimes mention it well ok.\r\nSo Toradora is a story about a tall dude and a short girl helping each other impress their crush.\r\nOh wait its just about Taiga... because Riuji is too much of a coward to ever do anything.\r\nSo Toradora is an story about this tall girl who gets constantly bullied and phisically abused by a little kid and she is too pathetic to fight backor stand up, she also is awfully nice to this shitty kid for no good reason and she cooks for him (the cleaning part is properly explained so cant complain about that). Oh wait this pathetic girl who has been trashed around for the entire show realizes that she likes this shitty kid (its not an spoiler its on the tittle) who is an asshole because plot.\\n\r\nDoes it sound off? Well thats Toradora if we were to reverse genders. Now hear me out im no SJW or feminist or any of those crazy person that screams equality but god dang if Toradora isnt stupid to watch.\\n\r\nSince i'm a man, im inclined to root for Riuji but he is such a little bitch when it comes to romance or proper human interaction or helping out others (hey look they are violently phisically and morally abusing your crush what you gonna do about it? Nothing? You are just going to watch as multiple people abuse of her? Ah ok).\\n\\n\r\nSo lets end this because im sick of Toradora already and i knew that i had to drop around ep 16 or 17 where my score for this show was around a 7 or 8.\\n\\n\r\nStory: I might be a little fresh on romance and i might start already hating a genre that rely on a shitty gimmic and crappy tropes again and again.\\n\r\nAll of this that gets enhanced because of the anime as a platform for the show.\\n\r\nBut i just cant stand and be shown a girl slowly extending a flower (good story) to me (the viewer) to pick it up just for her to wink and start all over again.\\n\r\nThis \"restart\" of the story is terrible on Toradora because the story seems to not be aware that its esentially restarting the story. Shows like Re:Zero use the \"restart\" (duh) as a plot point and the way to tell the story and it works because the story is fully aware of what its doing.\\n\r\nToradora keeps abusing of the \"restart\" mechanic and hopes that our normie anime watcher mind forgets any development and just keep enjoying some wicked toxic eternal ride.\\n\r\nSo you have the \"restart\" mechanic of slice of lifes paired with the obnoxiously slow and annoying anime romance... surely Toradora is a show that is better than the sum of its awful components. Yeah well no.\\n\r\nThe story in Toradora is slow and annoying. Every time a confession is thrown around they just go like \"Yeah it didnt happened\" when the plot dictates it and this is lazy because its also picky as some confessions do actually impact the story and others not.\\n\r\nWhenever Taiga confesses her next confessions just lose more and more power because us as a viewer (if we arent mental) feel less and less shocked and moved by them (or at least we should but looking at the score and reviews its obvious that's not the case).\\n\r\nThe story sometimes seem realistic but then it crashes with our toxic and unrealistic cast of  characters then it just falls flat on its face unable to keep moving forward.\\n\r\nAnd when the story does that, the viewer that is actually looking forward a well tought and written story fall flat on their face as well.\\n\r\nToradora is pathetic when it comes to telling a love story or just a story but most of the time its because of its horrible toxic cast of characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: I could rant for hours about the toxicity and the unmorality of these characters so i'll try not to.\\n\r\nIf we look and value these characters for their entertaining factor then they are trash because they are incredibly toxic and you hope everyone dies tragically on a fire.\\n\r\nIf we value these characters trough criticism and a more technicall view then they are still garbage but not as infuriating.\\n\r\nAt first i tought that the characters in Toradora were just simply missunderstood, shy or undecisive (hell they are teens... oh wait just barely). But as more and more episodes were going down i realized that these characters were just trash.\\n\r\nMinorin never gets enough flak for being obnoxious, loud, violent, manipulative and most of the time a major pain in the ass.\\n\r\nShe never works as a romantic interest because she is not charming on any way. This isnt a negative factor because it properly shows romance realistically as we sometimes see some dude falling for a girl while you scratch your head furiously trying to realize what the hell is going trough his head.\\n\r\nBut Minorin avoids this. Is not like you werent understanding her persona and her motivations.\\n\r\nIs just that her persona and motivations are toxic, trash and oppresive.\\n\r\nUp until the end she is always the same and thats bad because her start is terrible.\\n\r\nShe is a bad joke that keeps getting repeated again and again. When the story tries to make her go out of her usual mold of behaviours it is terrible because she doesnt just simply break character, she obliterates her character (bonus points for phisically and morally abusing people n.n).\\n\r\nIf you ever get to meet someone like Minorin in real life please run away i beg of you.\\n\r\nKitamura. The male romance interest or a less obnoxious Minorin (Ugh i would have killed for Kitahara to be replacing Minori...).\\n\r\nThanks to an small screen time and the lack of proper conversation scenes we never get to figure Kitamura. Sure he is quirky and all of that but he holds no real weight on the story and could have been replaced with a cardboard and nothing would have changed.\\n\r\nAmin is straight up carbon copied from other animes. There isnt a single piece of originality on her character. This is thankfully forgiven to the fact that she holds absolutely no weight on the story. Even if she wanted there is no way she can move the story, not even an inch.\\n\r\nHer first episodes while cliche are not bad and you would think that her character would revolve around maturing and becoming a better person but she just makes criptical and annoying comments here and there. Like a naggy viewer that does nothing but criticize but never tells a way to fix the shitty story (holy shit Amin is me as a viewer).\\n\r\nSo since the cast of side characters are either human garbage or just an unimportant cardboard then the weight of the show fall into our main cast of characters.\\n\r\nTiger (more like dragon) and dragon (more like a dumb puppy...).\\n\r\nTaiga is the starchild of the show and she is cute and small so why the hell would we want to change anything of her? That would upset her hivemind of fans!\\n\r\nTaiga has a ton of potential that is simply not used. She starts as an horrible person and the show ends with her being almost the same horrible person.\\n\r\nDwelving more into her character is meaningless. Anyone with a bunch of working brain cells knows that no one should ever act like Tiger because the world will never bend to their complaining. She is like a crying baby that didnt get her favourite sweet bought and the anime is the father that will always bend over and get her sweet rinse and repeat. \\n\r\nSomeone wants to annoy Taiga? Better throw sakuga here and there to add a ton of impact to these scenes and make the viewer see this incredibly violent display and forcing them to side with Taiga who 90% of the time is in the wrong. But Taiga is small and cute so how could she be wrong?\\n\r\nRiuji is probably the Hercules of this show at least on the first episodes. He cooks, he cleans, he's tall and has the badass looks (oh wait we are going to ignore this on ep 2 already? oh ok) while also being kind as hell who wouldnt like him?\\n\r\nThen the realization hits. His kindness loses its conceivability.\\n\r\nAnd thats bad dude! If the major aspect of his character (major? Ugh it might be his only saving feature if we dwelve enough into his mindset) is not charming then what will we do?\\n\r\nShould we make him develop something? Should we make him start being less stupid and coward? Nah just make him throw even more kindness for no good reason.\\n\r\nAnd this is the problem with Riuji. He is a water well. He is on the story to please the other characters and when he fails to do it (and he fails a lot) then we realize that he is inmature as hell and his mask of good will is ment to hide the fact that he is incredibly unidimensional.\\n\r\nThey are all a disgusting bunch. Oh yeah and Minorin phisically and morally abuses of her best friend in front of the most important persons on her life dont ever forget that because that happens.\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound: Yeah i guess they are fine but they get overshadowed by a terrible toxic cast of characters along a sloppy slow and dumb story filled with \"because the plot said so\".\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Ah... yes... The saving factor. The 50/50 on the ballet of books and animes (or movies or whatever). Even if the characters on some books like Plop are absolute waste of oxigen the book might be good because its entertaining right?\\n\r\nIt doesnt matter if everyone in Toradora (except Inko chan) is a toxic piece of shit as long as the story as a whole is a good experience that leaves a good taste in your mouth!\\n\r\nWell... the product as a whole is honestly really good. Is enjoyable and its comedical elements alongside its slice of life moments are well done.\\n\r\nI can say that purely from an entertaining factor i could go as far as saying i did liked Toradora.\\n\r\nThat's the reason i had the show so highly rated up to the 18 or 17 episode (and damn if i should have dropped while it was good!). The ride as a whole is truly enjoyable even if its cast is human waste and the story is rubbish\\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal veredict: With an insulting cast of characters that shows what you Dont! have to do in real life instead of leaving some teaching or a moral to be learned from Toradora stands up as a lot of things but a love story (yeah there is never explained why Dragon likes what he likes) failing its most basic point when telling a love story: Explaining why the lovers like each other.\\n\r\nSo if Toradora isnt a well written romance then its a slice of life with romantic elements?\\n\r\nNo, the romance fills the screen 70% of the time.\\n\r\nA show that shows us that you dont have to mature and/or become a better person and just look for some loser that blindly worships and takes care of your every need because there is no sane person on the world aside from probably your parents and him that will ever want to do something like that.\\n\r\nA show that proves again and again that it doesnt matter if you are a horrible person as long as you feel that the world is against you then you can keep being a vortex of happyness, money and good will to those around you that for some god knows reason care about your pathetic ass.\\n\r\nA show that is scared of ever showing a guy standing up or being a man because that would be sexist and opressive because males are stronger than women so under no circumstance a men should ever touch a woman.\\n\r\nWhich wouldnt be a terrible moral if the opposite applied. But Toradora is not equal.\\n\r\nToradora is an anime and therefore guys must be trashed around and beaten up constantly because that's somehow funny and dont worry everything will go good in the end because this is anime.\\n\r\nTruly a disgusting, toxic and sometimes realistic portrayal of romance and high school that i highly encourage to people to watch.\\n\r\nIf you like it, if you hate it, if its unfair, if its inmature, if its stupid, if its pretentious, if its sexist, if its infuriating... it doesnt matter in the end as long as you are Taiga.",

            "content": "Toradora was the first anime that EVER made me cry hard and not many others have made me cry the way Toradora did. Toradora, while it can be a bit ridiculous at times, feels very grounded to me and the first time I watched it, I was the same age as the characters and I could feel the way they did - it's why the anime resonated with me so much and why it still does. It was the first anime that made me go, huh, I can relate to that. \r\nSTORY - 8\r\nIt's simple at first, Taiga and Ryuji make a deal to helpthe other get closer to their crushes and hijinks ensue. Their friendship leads to rumours about their relationship and at first, it sounds like a fun rom-com and it really is. The story is pretty simple, but it's full of laughs. Watching them fail and succeed at setting the other up is funny and then watching Taiga and Ryuji fall in love made it heartwarming. Though, as the series goes on, we realise there's a lot more to them then meets the eye though. Taiga has deep rooted issues due to feeling isolated by her family and while I do not have these issues with family per say, that loneliness and isolation Taiga felt was what resonated with me. I understood how she felt, because that was how I felt. \\n\\n\r\nART - 9\\n\r\nIt's a cute art style. It's not a stand out art style but it's still cute. Not much more I can say about it honestly.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND - 8\\n\r\nThe OST was pretty nice and the first OP is the best. It's catchy, fun and up tempo and it'll get stuck it your head. The second OP is good too, as well as the EDs. I didn't honestly pay that much attention to the music, I was too invested in the characters. I've watched it both dubbed and subbed, and have no preference. Watch it how you prefer, I do tend to lead toward the dub only because I find dubs more relaxing.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER - 10\\n\r\nThe characters are what makes Toradora so good, in my opinion. Taiga is my favourite character and probably my favourite tsundere girl too (though Chitoge is a close second). I feel like she takes on the trope of tsundere and sticks to it well, but more importantly, she goes beyond just that trope and a good character needs to do that. Ryuji is just as likeable, though his obliviousness does get grating sometimes. The supporting characters are all fun and entertaining, Ami being the stand out of them. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT - 10\\n\r\nAs I said, Toradora was the first anime that made me really cry because I felt like I related to Taiga's feelings of loneliness. It also made me laugh so so much and it's incredibly heart warming and fun as well. It's one of the few anime I could watch over and over and never get sick of, the characters are too fun and the simple story always manages to hook me in. The characters are relatable and fun and that makes it even more enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL - 10\\n\r\nThere's a reason Toradora is my favourite romance anime and the anime I'll suggest to anyone looking for something new. It's fun, it's relatable and the characters really hook you in. The characters elevate what is a rather simple story of two friends helping each other with their crushes and it was genuinely heartwarming to see the romance between Taiga and Ryuji blossom. Toradora is must see for anyone who enjoys romance anime, and although Taiga's tsundere trope could turn people away, her growth beyond that is what makes her such a compelling character. \\n",

            "content": "How many anime are there that are about a couple of high school kids falling in love? The reason why there are so many of these anime is that the setting has a lot of potential for a good story. Still, after a while of watching these stories, they tend to grow rather stale. And that's when an anime like Toradora comes around to liven things up again!\r\n The story of Toradora starts out pretty simple. Our main protagonists have a crush on each other's best friend. They discover this fact and pledge to help each other with their respective crushes. Aside from general characterbuilding, that's pretty much it. I can tell you that right after I watched the first episode, I had a very sure fire prediction about what was going to happen by the end show. Whether I was right or wrong is irrelevant. What is relevant is that I was always hanging by the edge of my seat to see what happened in the next episode. \\n\\n\r\n The success of Toradora's story was built upon the strong foundation of its characters. My favorite thing about Toradora is how it's characters just refuse to conform to common tropes. I wouldn't say everyone is completely realistic, but they all have just enough unique characteristics to define themselves with. Also, there aren't any characters that are \"perfect.\" Each of them has their own faults and insecurities. However, aside from the main five cast members you see in the opening sequence, most everyone else is kind of forgettable. \\n\\n\r\n Speaking of the big five characters in Toradora, we have:\\n\r\n 1. Ryuugi Takasu, an intimidating young man with a talent for various kinds of housework. \\n\r\n 2. Taiga Aisaka, a cute and clumsy girl who has a tendency to lash out at others.\\n\r\n 3. Ami Kawashima, a teen model who pretends to be airheaded, although she is actually quite arrogant.\\n\r\n 4. Minori Kushieda, a cheerful and athletic girl who is also the best friend of Taiga. \\n\r\n 5. Yuusaku Kitamura, the vice-president of the student council who is also the best friend of Ryuugi.\\n\r\n As you have probably put together by now, Ryuugi likes Minori and Taiga likes Yuusaku, and Ryuugi and Taiga make up our special love alliance. \\n\\n\r\n Each character takes a few episodes down the line to develop, but the story of Toradora isn't ever focused on just one particular character. The relationship between everyone is always developing, it\u2019s just that the characters take turns to flesh out their backstory.\\n\\n\r\n About the sound and animation in Toradora, there is nothing wrong going on. However, I was a bit disappointed with character designs. Having two girls with the same face and different hair colors doesn't exactly speak creativity. Also, my favorite track was actually the opening theme, and then they changed it about halfway through the show. \\n\\n\r\n Time for some final thoughts on Toradora. Firstly, I think that if you plan on watching it, you should decide beforehand to watch the whole thing. It\u2019s not the kind of anime that can be judged until you have finished it. About eight or nine episodes into it, I thought of Toradora as a funny high school sitcom. Turned out, I was very wrong. Also, I think that Toradora is a great access point for getting into the slice-of-life genre. It spends some time tugging onto your heart strings, but nothing overly strenuous. I spent more time laughing than anything else when I was watching it.\\n\\n\r\n Final Verdict: Toradora is pleasant, funny, and entertaining. You can watch it to have a good time with friends, have an enjoyable evening, or maybe just to see a touching teen romance. And if you're looking for a way to get into a new genre of anime, Toradora is a great place to start with!\\n",

            "content": "Toradora! A spoiler free review. \r\n   For a long time I truly believed there are only two types of people that everyone has in their life. 1. A person who understands you but doesn't care about you. or 2. A person who cares about you but doesn't understand you. Even looking at this statement I can categorize the people in my life. Most of my family I believe care for me but really don't understand me while some people I've met through friends, work and school truly understood me, but because of that understanding, didn't give a damn. \r\nI think we do thiskinda thing in defense of being hurt. Or at least, I think I do this sort of thing to avoid being hurt. I always thought it'd be great if I could meet someone that both cared about me and understood me. But asking for that is assuming that people need to be understood. That everything has a hidden meaning. Maybe the words \"What are you doing later?\" doesn't mean \"I love spending time with you and only you\" but \"What are you doing?\" It's terrifying sometimes to think how people can be so forward when we see it as impossible.\\n\\n\r\nEven though not everything can be understood about someone else I think I was wrong my whole life. Sometimes caring about a person is to accept you won't understand them or their feelings. But you choose to be there anyway. And sometimes to understand a person is to show that you're willing to care about them more than yourself. \\n\\n\r\nThis show is my favorite love story. You don't need to understand love. You don't need to care. The second you have to convince yourself you like someone or something, you don't. Love is not about that. I didn't have to think about loving this show or its characters. I just did. It doesn't need anymore than that. And that's pretty cool.",

This show thrives on the characters but the story keeps it all together.\r\nThe story is something that can often ruin an anime but Toradora! keeps everything aligned and interesting for all 25 episodes. There is enough spontaneity to keep you guessing and enough predictable to not through you off or create plot holes  \r\nAll in all,Toradora! gives you the certain vibe and feeling that is almost indescribable. You get so wrapped up in the story and the characters you feel a better empty after it is over. Fortunately, it's re-watch value is EXTREMELY high.",

            "content": "Potential spoilers at the last paragraph of the review.\r\nToradora! Alright. Well, to start things off, this show is actually good, I'm surprised. If you like comedy/romance that just does things right, this is for you. Toradora! is a sneaky series that incorporates all production elements to create a cohesive work that pushes the audience to where it needs to be. I think it also deserves praise for how nuanced and understated many interactions are. God is in the details. And too often in anime, we have a situation where all emotional go over the top. Toradora! says there's more than one way to do things.With that being said, let's get into it. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\\n\r\nToradora! is about a group of friends working through their 2nd year of high school, with all the romantic woes and drama that comes with it. It focuses on Ryuji and Taigi. In terms of plot, there isn't a strong sequence of events that really ties the series together, but that's OK. Hell, it's accurate. That's how high school is. You're riding the ride of life and special things happen, but you don't dwell on the structured events of your past for too long. This would normally make it difficult for the audience to retain interest: no connecting plot threads means that often the audience has nothing to look forward to. Toradora! recognizes this potential problem and stops it before it can begin by using the developing relationships between their characters as waypoints. At most any point between episodes, the friend group is either starting to go/do something special, or there has been a major development between characters that the audience wants to see come to light. It generates constant forward momentum without really disturbing what is natural about high school or blowing the stakes out of proportion. \\n\\n\r\nThere are other aspects that are worth talking about, but in the end, they are too spoiler heavy so I'll just float over it. The structured events in the plot often act in ways that change the audience's perception of the characters so that the audience's expectations match up with development between the characters. The best example of this is what happens with Taiga around Christmas time. Also, plot threads that could seem random tend to be hinted at beforehand, so that some kind of development in that area seems expected. What it boils down to is that Toradora! has a strong plot where it always feels like something important is happening. \\n\\n\r\nYou can kind of tell what the ending will be from the beginning just based on promo material and the way the stage is set up, so I would've liked to see something a little more surprising. But the way things happen is engaging and unexpected, so it is always exciting.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\\n\r\nWhen I was looking at the promo material for this series, the art style sort of irked me, and I was expecting it to be a point of pain for me as I progressed through the series. I could not have been more wrong. The style looks totally fine in the series. More than fine, it is completely fitting of a relaxed romance/comedy series. Just like the tone of the series, the art style is often soft, delicate, and understated. But at the same time, it is dynamic. The artists often change characters to allow for a large range of expression, which is totally in line with the goal of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe art also has no problems going outside of its comfort zone. I watched Tokyo Ghoul and Mirai Nikki before this since I am doing a rundown of the MAL popular page. Honestly, this has way better action scenes than the both of them. The action has punch, is extremely well paced, and contrasts well with the rest of the series. \\n\\n\r\nI had very few complaints as far as art is concerned. Very little use of CGI, and most of it is pretty tasteful. I will say that, for some reason, Kawashima's character gets flubbed a little from time to time. Not really sure why, and it's a shame because she is supposed to be the pretty one.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\\n\r\nNothing crazy to talk about here. The OP/EDs range from decent to forgettable, but they are used well in the series, where they are always set up so that they make an impact at the perfect time. The opening panel of OP2 specifically with a quick scroll up on Taiga is often shocking/satisfying in the context of the previous scene. I will say that the mixing and ambient sound effects are very well done. Sometimes the scores feel a little stale, but it is easy to ignore that.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\\n\r\nHey, it's the focal point. In any romance/drama series, the quality, relatability, and depth of the characters is paramount. Toradora! does really well. There is a good reason for this. The cast is extremely tight. There are really 5 characters that the show wants you to care about, and they are together all the time. That makes it much easier to have these characters progress in their relationships. There are other side characters that are somewhat entertaining but are usually used to slightly push the plot and maybe provide a foil of what is happening to the main group. The characters are \\n\\n\r\nKushieda and Kawashima, in particular, are great characters. Kawashima is a great take on a villain, where it is very easy to dislike her for how she treats her peers. But you come to realize that she has good reasons for doing what she does, and is very in touch with what people want due to a more mature lens. The way she bullies people also seems insanely real. Like it is exactly what the popular schoolgirl bully would do, but in an even more mature and understanding way. She fills a complex role in the story very well. She also just creates a lot of momentum in the plot. \\n\\n\r\nThe development in each character is well executed, but also very subtle. You could craft a sentence that summarizes how each character has changed over the course of the series, and those sentences could seem very small and minor, but that's what makes it so real. \\n\\n\r\nI also wish we saw a little more of Kitamura: he is a fun and deep character that could get off the sideline a little more. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment here mostly comes from humor and how excited I am to see the characters progress as the series goes on. They do a good job at both. Kushieda, in particular, is great at catching attention in both aspects. If she is happy, she is super entertaining. If something is off with her, then something important is about to happen. Kitamura is also very bubbly and exciting. Taiga does ridiculous things all the time that are fun to watch. Ryuuji and Kawashima don't do much crazy stuff, but their conversations with other members of the cast are always earnest and endearing. I mention the characters so much because that is really where all the enjoyment is derived from. The series is nuanced and delicate, so this isn't a roller coaster ride... most of the time. Some scenes are very intense. But most of the time it is understated drama that is built and released over time. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9 \\n\\n\r\nNothing to say here. I don't think many people will try to crown Toradora! as the great crown jewel of anime, but it's a really solid show. They execute everything well and the entire work is cohesive and serves its message. \\n\\n\r\nSpoilers ahead. One thing I take issue with is the general theme of the series. It is supposed to be pretty optimistic, that anybody can find love in the most unexpected place. But I find it very bittersweet as well. Are people that bad at guessing where their truest feelings will lie? Is all it takes to build a strong relationship with somebody a certain level of familiarity? Those ideas are sort of sad and run against the ideas of traditional romance. This isn't something that Toradora! really hits on directly, so it doesn't impact your view very much. But it is somewhat haunting if you aren't satisfied with how the romantic interests panned out.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Anime... we need to talk.  Honestly though it's me, not you, I've changed and I realize that now.  The unfortunate collateral though is Toradora, which by all rights is fine.  Toradora you're not the problem either, you're not even bad, it's just me.  A decade and a half plus of anime watching and being an adult will do that to you.  So Toradora, don't feel bad about my score, you're still OK, but it's just not want I want now and perhaps for others like me which is why I've decided to write this.\r\nIn a different time and place, perhaps10 years ago or maybe back in college this might of been a show I feel in love with and it could be for you.  I feel that I need to say that this show probably will be (and heck, clearly is) loved by many.  For me though, I just can't do it anymore.\\n\\n\r\nToradora has some truly awesome moments, probably about 3 or 4 really stand out scenes that make you think \"OK, this is why we're here, this is what we've signed up for\", but than just kinda continues and as lame of a description as I know this is, that's Toradora.  It just continues.  It plods along, gives you a great moment than just continues for many episodes, shows you something special and than... continues for episode after episode and... well you get it.  Toradora isn't slow, there aren't pacing problems, it just moves smoothly along at 5 below the speed limit as to not get a ticket.  When all you really want is for it to just pick it up to 10 over because no one will ticket you for that and we can get to the destination sooner.\\n\\n\r\nAgain going back to this being my problem I hopped on this show way after the fact.  So basically I've been inundated with threads, scores and youtube videos saying how great the romance is.  This is where my years of anime and age will hurt you Toradora because well... that isn't really what I think of when I think romance.  Man if lets say episode 26 was actually episode 20, that would be been amazing.  That's what I wanted.  I wasn't really looking for the weirdly rushed and out of place moments in the conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nI want to see love, I want to see couples, I don't want to see dozens of episodes of the main characters \"friends\" saying they want to help and be their for the couple, but well, they aren't really or people leading others on with no intention of doing anything.  Or episode after episode of two characters clearly knowing what they want, but neither doing anything about it.  These aren't the helpful friends the show says they are or the great characters I hope to see.  \\n\\n\r\nWhat's the main romance wasn't even bad, it wasn't cheap, it wasn't rushed or any of the multitude of ways you can describe romances you didn't like, it was, well, wishy washy.  I don't want to see that kind of stuff in real life let alone 26 episodes of wishy washy behavior.  You can't even give it the classic \"will they or won't they\" description since it's more \"they should be, just what is taking so long\".  Dragging it out and making things take too long doesn't make a payoff all the more grand, it almost makes the payoff just a sigh of relief, when you can say \"finally, it's about time\" and that's not a good thing.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that brings me back to my main point.  Toradora, it's me, you're just not for me anymore.  You might of been, heck you most likely really were right in my wheel house, but now I just can't put up with it.  You can't give me 3 awesome moments, ignore them, give me 10 minutes of great in the last episode and than insult your own ending by being all anime.  Obviously I'm in a minority and this show is loved by many.  I mentioned early it's not bad, this is purely a personal preference which I can clearly see.  So this goes out to people like me, if you could imagine yourself saying these words than Toradora isn't for you because it will leave you disappointed and frustrated in the end.\\n\\n\r\nOh and lets see... show looks fine with satisfactory character designs, but I'm also done with little girl looking characters, but for some reason it didn't make me stop watching so good on you Toradora.  I honestly can't remember music so it couldn't of been that good.  Basically it was as by the book, fine as you can get from production values.  Though there are a few moments when characters scream at each other or fight where things get all serious like you're about to watch some absurd fight in an action/adventure that stood out in an odd way.\\n\\n\r\nBefore I close this way too long review I just want to mention the supporting characters one more time because for the most part they were ehh... they kinda grated on me, I mention about how everyone's outlook is just frustrating and it seems like they aren't really great friends.  Hearing someone say \"but I just wanted you to be happy\", but not actually helping the couple get together isn't helping that person be happy.  Anime needs to learn this, that one is on you anime, that's not my problem, that's one of the few problems that's yours.",

Don't get me wrong, I know it's impossible to find a romance without drama, especially a SCHOOL romance. Still, Toradora seems to have more drama than necessary. It's annoying, but the characters and story make up for it. I usually don't like female characters, but I LOVE Taiga. She's so adorable and I love her personality. It's safe to say she's the ONLY female I like in this show (though the teacher isn't half bad, either). Honestly, I love the relationshipbetween Taiga and Ryuuji - I ship it so hard. They are so beautiful together, and they have such a strong, loving bond. It's the second best anime relationship ever (the first being Sawako and Shouta). When there's not drama happening, it feels pretty light-hearted and funny. Definitely worth it's salt, and easily a 10!",

The MC is a doormat for most of it, though better than some, and main-side character, Taiga, is full on tsundere.\\n\\n\r\nThe first few episodes set up the premise, doing so in a way that made me think, eh why not let's see how this goes. But I should have seen the signs and just stopped there before I went so far down the rabbit hole I felt I had to reach the bottom.\\n\\n\r\nInstead, I suffered through a good 10 episodes at least of constant tsundere that made me want to claw my eyes out, and yet I still kept on watching. There's not much to say, any memory of the plot stored in my brain had been fused out by the rage I felt. It was lots of school stuff and relationships and backstory and was painfully slow and boring. I suppose I have to admit it did acceptably story-wise, though characters acted infuriatingly at times. I suppose that comes with the genre.\\n\\n\r\nAfter getting through the middle of the show, things start heating up. Plot points everywhere, drama drama drama. Also tsundere, I don't think I mentioned that yet. On the bright side, Taiga warms a bit as the show goes on, like any not-trash tsundere should. Not that any tsundere is ever not trash. We have multiple characters that could be romance interests, attempts at hooking up, lots of exploring why that isn't happening, that kind of thing. Honestly the plot here drew me in, helped by the fact that Taiga was toned down. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending was... weird. I felt like it was trying to teach me a life lesson, but all it succeeded in doing was make me yell at my monitor that I would give the show one star if it went where I thought it would. It didn't, but the ending episode is pretty much a huge plot twist moment made, I hypothesize, precisely to infuriate me, specifically. Just a little bit more blood pressure after 24 other episodes of pure vain bursting. Then, in the last 30 seconds it diverts the plot twist and gives a really odd ending that left me... I don't know. It was... an ending? It wasn't really satisfactory but I don't know what to say is wrong about it.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Actual Thoughts\\n\\n\r\nHonestly the story was... Really good, I think. I had to struggle through so much stuff I hated, and yet I actually was entertained beneath the red haze. As I mentioned, the ending was extremely odd, but otherwise I'd say for a school drama it succeeds in its goals well. Though characters did act odd a couple of times. It explored the characters and the situations in ways that kept me intrigued, and the overall story arc was good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters had depth to them, and seemed to act sensibly to their personalities throughout. Seeing each character's story unfold was legitimately interesting to see.\\n\\n\r\nThere were some genuinely good moments in this show too, and while I wouldn't consider it a comedy, I laughed about two times during the show. They were good, hearty laughs so they count for a lot more.\\n\\n\r\nSound and animation was fine. I was too distracted to notice sound but the animation was on par or better.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 In Closing\\n\\n\r\nI can't fault anything about this show really... I hated every second, and yet... I would probably still recommend it to anyone who likes tsunderes. I enjoyed it, though some of that may be because I sometimes like watching stuff that makes me want to invert my body violently. If it had been less tsundere, had fewer silly character decisions and less cringe than I think I would have really enjoyed it fully.\\n\\n\r\nOverall... a very spiteful, disgusted, 8 out of 10. I hated it. It's not as though I enjoyed it or anything, hmph, whatever... baka.",

            "content": "This anime teaches us watches what it means when we want to understand others and the reason why to. For example, you can just disapprove someone because of your opinion, but did you try to figure out why the other person thinks another way? Either if yes or no, you should see things from the other person's perspective. Just like Toradora, at first the characters don't know each other's background and then when a character does find out something, they will seek to understand how the person feels. This anime has amazing character development where they start weak of being cowardly, but later on theylearn to move on and face their problems.\\n\\n\r\nThere was a lot of \"running away\" from problems in this anime, but the characters soon face it. So then it shows each character moving on and getting stronger.\\n\\n\r\nThe only problem was that the ending felt kind of rushed. For example, due to some actions there were a change of feelings very quickly. This may sound like a good thing, but the feeling I'm talking about is love. In the end of the anime I question myself of when the character had fallen in love with someone else. Anyway to make it more clear to me it was like \"I don't have those kind of feelings for that person anymore, and that is why I have feelings for this person\". So yeah, in the end the romance felt rushed of \"123\"  (to represent someone's name to make it less confusing) liking \"abc\" and then \"def\" just because \"abc\" did something to \"123\".\\n\\n\r\nAnyway the only problem was the rushed romance close to the ending of the anime. But besides that, the anime teaches us to try to understand others before disapproving them, and it also teaches that running away does not solve anything so you must face your problems. Well, not all of the characters faced their problem in the end, but at least most of them. This anime is recommended to those who enjoy romance, character development, a strong lead, comedy, and more.",

            "content": "Toradora! is a great school romance anime that really made me enjoy this genre a lot more.\r\nSTORY:\r\nThe story behind Toradora! is about a group of teens in highschool who develop relationships and friendships and discover who they really are throughout the show.  The story puts the characters in life like situations, and in response, the characters make realistic decisions tho these situations.  The main reason is it feels more realistic than most other animes.\r\nART:\r\nThe art is a bit lacking for when it was made; it's not the best of the best, but by no means is it bad.\r\nSOUND:\r\nThe openings and closings are great.They have an almost happy feeling which really mimics the show.  The voice acting is great, and there is not too many sounds in the show, which helps it stay realistic.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:\\n\r\nThis is one of the best parts of the show.  The characters are very close to life like and really develop through the show.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\r\nAs I said earlier, the show really made me love this genre of anime.  I am not that experienced with anime, but I definitely loved this show.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nAll these things made the show awesome.  I would definitely recommend this show if you like this genre.  And even if you don't watch it anyway, it may surprise you.\\n",

            "content": "Toradora was one of those shows that I started watching on a whim. I was bored and didn't want to do anything particularly productive, so I did what so many of us do/have done: I scanned through a few shows at random and stopped at the first one I thought might be good. Toradora was a good pick in this particular situation because I felt like watching something lighthearted \r\nand fast-paced. And even though I've become somewhat jaded concerning the genre it belongs to, I decided to give it a try anyway. I assumed I would get some silly entertainment for the first episode, thenabandon the series, as that has happened with a large majority of the other slice-of-life/romantic comedy anime I have attempted to watch. But, as often is the case with \\n\r\nassumptions, it was dead wrong.\\n\\n\r\nAs stated above, the only thing I thought going in to Toradora was that it would be lighthearted and fast-paced. Of course, I also hoped it would be funny, but I was expecting the majority of the \"humor\" to be in the same vein as the sexualized, fan-servicey garbage that is quickly becoming the mainstay of the anime industry. What I was not expecting was a hilarious, \\n\r\ntouching, dramatic anime which largely ignored the principle \"parts\" [forgive me] of its genre. (I say largely because they weren't totally ignored. *cough cough baka chi' cough*) I wasn't expecting a show that, paradoxically enough, seemed more mature because it had less \"mature\" content. I wasn't expecting characters that actually seemed relatable despite their strangeness. I wasn't expecting a conclusion that brought tears to my eyes. I guess what you could say is that I wasn't expecting most of what Toradora was. And for that I reason, I enjoyed it immensely.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't want to write a description of the show into my review (you can read one of those anywhere), neither did I want to do an entire overview of the show (I hate novel-length reviews). I just wanted to give some general thoughts I had about Toradora in a succinct fashion to give the reader my point of view. So, in conclusion, this show didn't blow me away with its \\n\r\nanimation, it didn't wow me with its musical score, and it didn't make me contemplate the deeper aspects of the human struggle with its thought-provoking storyline. But what it did do was enough. It made me laugh, it made me cry, and it made me want to think about it long enough to want to write this review. And by golly, that's gotta count for something. \\n\\n",

            "content": "TORADORA !! Words cannot describe how much I love this anime and how much of ann emotional impact it has left me with. I just HAD to write a review about this anime. This is a very underrated anime. An emotional impact literally bigger than this world. This is also the anime that got me into the school life anime section. I watched Clannad before it and to be honest a lot of it I found was pointless and draggede out and as a result I was a little bored with it and it's one of the most popular school lifes so my first impressionin this area wasn't very good. (Still a great anime Clannad, After Story was even better).\\n\\n\r\nIt's fantastic, brilliant, mind-blowing, surprising, emotional, dramatic and not to mention one of my PERSONAL favourite animes.. no shows of all time surpassing masterpieces such as deathnote and monster even! \\n\\n\r\nA lot of the people might be wondering why. Or how that's possible.\\n\\n\r\nIt is so incredibly and unimaginably beautiful and well put together. I have never connected into something like htis. And it's only 25 episodes! The ending of it was simply the best ending in anime for me except for maybe fmab. The part where they talk about 'love' in the end while takasu is running to the room with Taiga in it. Not to mention he has been waiting for her for 1 WHOLE YEAR. And he hasn't broken up with her. That's not the only reason though why I called it beautiful rest assure about that. SO many of the scenes are beautiful too.\\n\\n\r\nIt is also dramatic. The drama is not TOO much (YES!!!).It's just the right amount to make you cry your eyes out and not laugh about how stupidly cheesy it is.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is SUPER awesome and after a while gives you a feel of EXTREME nostalgia. The music is very good too. Seriously once i finished it i had such a bond with it that i had to rewatch it!! So nostalgic.\\n\\n\r\nFor me it is very relatable too. A lot of troubles do come from love. But still like I mentioned it is kind of very feel-good too. I dont know how but i felt so happy and warm inside after watching it.\\n\\n\r\nIt is super entertaining from beginning to end. One of the main things that ruined clannad a little was that it was boring and pointless for a lot of the parts. Not that problem with Toradora. I enjoyed every episode so much. From the occasional comedy to the drama in some episodes to just the dialogue of the very awesome characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are SO good. They are funny, smart, crazy, dumb or even stupid. All unique in their own way. I love them all SO much. \\n\\n\r\nIN CONCLUSION, I want more if this anime. I just want to see more of those EXTREMELY awesome toradora characters that i love so much. I dont care if the sequel or even movie or ova won't be as good i just want more kitamura, takasu, inko, ryuji, his mom, taiga, ami and minori. \\n\r\nPLEASE PEOPLE WATCH IT !! Overall i give it a gazillion out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nWell what can I say? This should be much higher.",
