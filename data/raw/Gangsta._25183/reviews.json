            "content": "If I can describe Gangsta in one word it would be... disappointingpieceofshit.\r\nA title that's so half-baked that it's truly deserving of a tailor-made portmanteau.\r\nAnd if you're one of the fortunate individuals who hasn't watched Gangsta yet then HALT, do not pass go, do not collect $200, stay away! As for the rest of the poor souls that suffered through the pilgrimage viewing that is Gangsta, on with the review. \r\nGangsta, a title name that immediately invokes imagery of money, sex, power and violence, and as luck would have it, a very appropriate namesake as well, as we're given just that in spades. This is astory that takes us to the deepest depths of society's bustling underbelly. Where law and order is traded in for carnage and mayhem. Where a wrong step can easily become your last. And where maturity is handled with as much subtlety as a Grand Theft Auto game. When it comes to try-hard entertainment, Gangsta has catapulted itself into another league but for all the wrong reasons. With content that can only be described as a pubescent teen's wet dream, it somehow managed something that's nigh impossible; taking a gratuitous amount of \"adult\" subject matter and making it all tepid in nature. A show stuffed from head to toe with lurid material yet invokes nothing, failing at even becoming lowbrow sleaze. For everything that Gangsta could have done it ended up doing nothing at all. Narratively, it also introduces a myriad of questions one after another but never once provides an answer for any of it, making this a double-edged sword of bad meets worse. With nothing to excite or stimulate you, this anime has mastered the art of blue balling. \\n\\n\r\nThe story follows the lives of three characters: handymen for hire, Worick and Nicolas, and former thottie, Alex, as they navigate their way through everyday life in the godforsaken hellhole of a city named Ergastulum that they call home, while also fighting off their own personal demons along the way. Because of Worick and Nicolas's line of work, they often find themselves caught in the cross-hairs of the city's perpetual battles to maintain power and balance. These inner-city civil wars are overseen by crime syndicates with the main source of conflict often tying back to a subgroup of humans named Twilights: people with genetically enhanced strength that could perform physical feats that far exceeds average humans while under the aid of certain drugs. They're basically pill poppin x-men. And as one would expect, due to these innate abilities, the Twilights are constant victims of societal discrimination while also serving as living weapons, which is an escalating issue just waiting to keel over. \\n\\n\r\nWith such a unique decrepit city serving as its setting and a premise that promises heavy-hitting content, you would think the creators would just run with it. But instead, what we get is a story that meanders around without any sort of uniformity behind its actions, effectively ending before it gets a chance to begin. It's like watching someone with ADD trying to multitask. Characters are constantly introduced only to be left hanging in the open with no explanation as to their overall involvement. Major events that develop in the backdrop would simply never exfoliate. Plot points are brought up to only come to a dead end with no resolution. And all of it leads towards an ending that can only be described as the biggest cock-tease of 2015. With its inability to finish anything, this anime is the spiritual embodiment of Finbarr Calamitous from Jimmy Neutron. It's incredibly half-assed. \\n\\n\r\nAnd as if to add insult to injury, despite all the over-the-top fights and constant debauchery going on in the city, the show itself remains painfully dull and uneventful. There are long stretches of time where absolutely nothing of relevance would happen. There may be a plot point itself that's \"grand\" in scope, but the build-up for it is often nonexistent, making it the equivalency of watching paint dry, even if the \"paint\" looks exciting on paper. Sometimes, when nothing of importance is going on, we're given an introspective look into the lives of our main characters. These are some of Gangsta's better moments as they help to get the audience familiarized to the psyche of the leads, as well as showcasing how they may have landed in their current positions in life. And while these moments may help elevated our ragtag group beyond cardboard cutout status, it doesn't stop the narrative from operating on AOL dial-up speed. The pacing is simply sluggish, even when what's being displayed would have you think otherwise. Story advancement is treated like an afterthought, which doesn't bode well for those that have a genuine interest in where the show would go next. \\n\\n\r\nThankfully, Gangsta doesn't spread itself too thin when it came to the characters, as most of the content centered around our three main leads. Worick is the level-headed member of the group and also the one in charge of keeping things in order. His quick wit and chill demeanor made him instantly likable. We're given a lot in the way of his complicated backstory that he shares with Nicolas; a backstory that helps thread the duo's connection to each other. Alex, the former thottie, is an emotionally damaged person that spends a majority of the show opening up to her new lifestyle with her two new companions. Despite her previous profession and general skimpy appearance, she's a rather reserved individual that we only learn more about gradually as the show goes on. But possibly the most memorable of the three that chews up all the scenery he's in is Nicolas himself.\\n\\n\r\nWhile not crucial to the overall material, one unique inclusion that Gangsta deserves credit for is giving us a main character that's Deaf. As of the time of this writing, there has never been a Deaf lead in an animated TV series before. For the most part, Deaf characters are usually reduced to taking up insignificant roles, like the brief uncredited scene in Mobile Police Patlabor: WXIII, or even worse, they're used in a way that screams tokenism, placed in the story to rack up sympathy points instead of being treated as just another person. This is the first time an anime has placed a Deaf character center-stage and treated them as a person, never once resorting to excessive victimizing. This can help open up dialogue for a better understanding of Deaf culture for those that were previously oblivious to it, making it a progressive move on Gangsta's part. \\n\r\nHaving taken ASL (American Sign Language) for two years myself during high school, there are mannerisms and behavioral patterns that are commonly recognized among any Deaf community, regardless of if it's abroad or not. And I can say that Manglobe did a commendable job in portraying that (for the most part). Of course, there are limitations to what they could accomplish, due to the fact that it's an animated feature and not live-action. But with all things considered, the translation came out better than I would have expected.\\n\\n\r\nAnd while Manglobe deserves respect on that front, it doesn't mean everything was smooth sailing for the presentation as a whole. If anyone has familiarized themselves with the studio's catalog, their creative output has always been plagued with inconsistencies. With many instances of distorted character models and janky choreography, Gangsta was far from anything you would call prim and proper. Where the show did shine was with its overall tone and atmosphere, the likes of which swept over every aspect of the audiovisual output, creating a sense of uniformity that melded the characters and narrative together. This wasn't much of a surprise given that director Shuk\u014d Murase was responsible for bringing it to life. His trademarked style, blending neo-gothic aesthetics and vogue-like character models to create a kind of occult aura\u2014as prominently showcased with Ergo Proxy and Witch Hunter Robin\u2014bled its way into Gangsta, if only to a lesser degree to adjust to the show's more \"urban\" outfitting. Murase brought his A-game once again, gifting Gangsta with a tone befitting its content. A directorial facelift that it desperately needed. While that didn't make the false sense of maturity that the show was hiding behind any better, it certainly made it more palatable as a viewing experience. \\n\\n\r\nTo help heighten the atmosphere even further, the music was brought to life by Tsutchie, who's famous for his work on Manglobe's fan-favorite, Samurai Champloo. Instead of drawing back to the Hip-Hop/Trip-Hop genre fusion of his work on Champloo, Tsutchie embarks down a sonic path that's more EDM inspired. Being nowhere as heavy-handed as Parasyte's take on the genre, Tsutchie took a far more stripped-down approach. Those that are fans of the more house/drum 'n' base aspects of EDM would find something to enjoy with Gangsta's musical choice. The opening theme \"Renegade\" by STEREO DIVE FOUNDATION was a nice J-pop/EDM track that kicked things into high gear for each new episode. Despite its niche sound, it's an opening that has easily received broad appeal due to its melody, glitch-pop flavoring, and midway breakdown. The ending, while also nice, was a more morbid song that wrapped up the episode nicely but didn't really serve as something you didn't want to skip after a few listens. \\n\r\nAll in all, the music was a fine fit and worked a lot better than expected for a show that tried to have a more dreary depiction. But for the brief glimpses of actual merit that Gangsta may have had, it's immediately snuffed out when you begin to factor in the issues it was plagued with. No little amount of good it had could outweigh the ton of bad that saddled it down.  \\n\\n\r\nThere's really no way around it; Gangsta was a flop. With each new episode, the show found itself struggling to stay afloat. What started out with audiences crossing their fingers for that eventual \"Aha\" moment to kick in, quickly fizzled away into disinterest as it slowly trudged towards the chopping block of its final episode. And with no solid conclusion in sight, Gangsta took what little potential it was holding onto and proceeded to run it into the ground, as it faded to black and people began moving on to the next best thing, erasing the thought of its existence from their memory. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10 \\n\\n\r\nI have a rather complicated relationship with studio Manglobe. On the one hand, they've created some of my most beloved shows (Ergo Proxy, Samurai Champloo and House of Five Leaves) but on the other, they're responsible for some of my most detested ones as well (Deadman Wonderland and Karneval). But instead of falling into either category, Gangsta lands somewhere in the middle ground for me, with the studio's other works like Samurai Flamenco, The World God Only Knows and The Sacred Blacksmith. Shows I don't quite like but don't hate either. They're simply titles that fell short of the mark for me. It's really aggravating seeing what Gangsta ultimately became, given all the untapped potential it was working with. But the overall lack of purpose in its plotting and the abrupt ending has assured that it'll be more loathed than remembered with fond memories. But perhaps the most disheartening thing about this show is that it serves as Manglobe's swan song since the studio went bankrupt and disbanded right after finishing this show. They were my personal favorite studio, so it's sad seeing them go out on such a sour note. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nGangsta is yet another title from the 2015 summer season that had potential but quickly dissolved away into nothingness. With plot points that went nowhere and characters that were never given reason to exist whatsoever, Gangsta squandered its run-time with too many issues to get a pass. And when taking into consideration what could only be the biggest cock-tease ending in years, there's no solid defense that could protect Gangsta from getting the ax.",

            "content": "Gangsta is the type of show that sounds catchy as it gets. As the name implies, there are gangsters which means there\u2019s crime. However, there are people who takes care of business these problems in the city of Ergastulum. Enter Nick and Worick, a pair of badass bishounen who takes cares of crime like another day in the park. As ordinary as the show sounds, it gets more complicated once they are assigned to a task that goes beyond their expectations. But for the audience, what should your expectations be for the show?\r\nBased on the manga written by Kosuke, Gangsta is essentially a series ofcrime fighting and classified as a more mature seinen. The urban city setting invites a lot of attention when it comes to violence such as prostitution, drug dealing, and other illegal activities. Luckily, we do have Nick and Worick to take care of the troubles. To make their task easier, we learn that Nick is a \u201cTwilight\u201d, the type of person who has heightened abilities enhanced by a special drug. While Worick doesn\u2019t possesses heightened senses, he does make it up for his smooth way of talking and photographic memory. The two aren\u2019t really alike as partners to kill crime. However at the end of the day, it\u2019s hard not to feel attached to them with their roles in the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing of the story is not hard to get comfortable with. The first few episodes quickly establishes the vulnerability of Ergastulum. Sometimes, it feels like a Gotham city where crime runs loose with Nick and Worick playing the roles of Batman and Robin. The mature style of the show can be quickly realized when they undertake an operation on screen in the first episode. The show isn\u2019t shy about making the violence happen on screen because it needs to create a bit of realism. At the same time, Nick and Worick recuses a young woman named Alex, who plays many important roles in the story. As a show like Gangsta, we learn much more about the characters. And that\u2019s a strong emphasis that needs to be realized because we want to learn more about the characters. They come from such different backgrounds and their lives are often at risk in such a dangerous environment. In Ergastulum, there are essentially no rules. It\u2019s about making a living and surviving each day. \\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to characterization, I can safely say that Gangsta knows its characters quite well. We get background storytelling especially for Nick and Worick. In fact, we learn much about their past including the people Nick associated with and how he got involved as a member of Twilight. On the other hand, there\u2019s also Worick who became his partner. The series reveals his true name and how he used to be neglected by his parents. A good amount of focus is the chemistry between the duo. It also takes elaborate time to detail how Twilight members are made and what their rules are. In the present, we can see how their past affected their relationship. As characters themselves, Nick is also unique as he suffers from a disability; he is deaf. At first, this may seem like a big problem as partners needs to coordinate well vocally. However, it\u2019s quickly established that he and Worick can work well with sign language and seemingly instinct to trust one another. And that\u2019s important development for the two. With such dangerous assignments each day, trust is a vital part between partners and the series does a good job to show their trustworthiness. On a comedic note, we also see what Worick does on his time off.  The smooth antihero has a way to give ladies pleasure and his keen sense of photography plays important roles in breaking cases. Nick is more like a warrior \u2013 armed with a sword, ruthlessness, and self-sense. This is an antithesis compared to Alex, a frail girl who suffers from PTSD-like symptoms. As the story progresses on, we learn more about her as well that reveals the darker side of Gangsta.\\n\\n\r\nDespite having some comedy here and there, the majority of the show has a mature feeling. Most of the characters are adults and in their mid-30s. The gangsters in the show are also prone to violence and some show how reckless they can be to accomplish their goals. Guns, swords, and bombs are no strangers to the series along with the fast paced action. With a setting that has a Mediterranean-like feeling, the show also seems like a social satire at time with its cultural themes. In particular, Nick and Worick are dressed with style while other characters such as Alex are portrayed with vulnerability.  While it gets top and gory at times, the show is also something I\u2019d describe as a smart flick. The themes of prostitution, child soldiers, and experimentations are an anti-establishment of what we try to make society as of today. Because in Gangsta, there\u2019s all types of trouble running loose with gangs and the mafia. The underworld is nothing short of what we try to eliminate from today\u2019s society. And in this show, that\u2019s clearly an understatement.\\n\\n\r\nIn essence, artwork is crude for the show. By crude, I don\u2019t mean it as sloppy but rather by the way society is depicted for its story. For its setting, the show does a clever job to make it seem like Ergastulum is a separate space from the outside world. The urban style combined with its classic atmospheric setting is very fitting for a show such as this. The characters are dressed neatly with the expensive suits and jewelry. However, it\u2019s the way the violence that\u2019s handled that gets cruel. Make no mistake. Gangsta is uncensored glory and enters a territory where cops cannot handle jobs on their own. That\u2019s why we got people like Nick and Worick. Speaking of which, the duo can seem like an eye candy for the ladies. In particular, Worick has that womanizing like charm with the way he looks. And as stereotypical as it can be, the guys in the show are designed like bishounen with hardcore abs and well-built figures. The show also has fan service with sex, in particular involving Worick. That\u2019s right. He\u2019s a ladies man and the show doesn\u2019t make us forget that.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s really hard to ignore the soundtrack. There\u2019s no easy way to describe it but there\u2019s a combination of upbeat, chilling, and jazz. It almost gives off a feeling of relaxation even during the most intense of scenes. Of course, action itself is also well coordinated with the OST. I\u2019d also have to say that both the OP and ED theme song are very attractive. It has a stylistic way of portraying the themes of the show with a montage of the main characters. And speaking of the characters, a strong plus for the show is their character voice mannerisms. In particular, Nick is the one to take notice of because of his lack of hearing. When he does speak, his voice seems like it\u2019s disconnected especially with the broken sentences. That\u2019s what really makes him different from the other characters though as it also establishes a link between him and his past. But really, when it comes down to it, Gangsta\u2019s music is bold and can be relentlessly appealing to the ears.\\n\\n\r\nSo what\u2019s to say about Gangsta in the end? It\u2019s a pretty much a badass show ran with its premise and knows what its intentions are. The cast of characters has an enthralling presence and throughout the story, we learn a great deal about the main protagonists. Sure, the show can seem a bit cruel at times but it\u2019s important to realize its purpose. Gangsta is not a show with colorful rainbows and where happy endings happen. In fact, I would say that the ending of the show is a bit controversial in itself. Regardless though, it\u2019s still a show that I\u2019d recommend anyone to give it a try especially for fans interested in a mature action flick.",

            "content": "Despite a few extraordinary contributions, the pulp crime genre is one that anime does not do particularly well.  I felt compelled to write this review of Gangsta because of the many unwarranted comparisons to Black Lagoon.  Gangsta is nothing like Black Lagoon, and it will be especially disappointing to watch with such an expectation.\r\nIf you want to watch pulp crime involving heists, car chases, and briefcases full of guns, cash and drugs, well that's not this anime.  Gangsta has no grounding in real world politics or criminal activity.  In fact, the mob families seem uninterested in any actual criminal activity, outsideof episode 1, and some mobsters, like Miss Christiano (the Tohsaka Rin of mafia bosses), seems so goodhearted as to be a downright pillar of the community.\\n\\n\r\nYou may be disappointed to find that Gangsta has no relationship to reality at all, set in a fictional city with a past that does not fit into our real-world history.  Many of the characters are superpowered humans called Twilights, and the story arcs are driven by the existence of Twilights and how humans interact with them - as opposed to something that is more grounded in real world situations and groups- like say, looting a Nazi submarine for fun and profit.\\n\\n\r\nGangsta is also not a fast-paced action-movie roller coaster, but rather has languid pacing.  This could make for a fine noir tone, but except for Nico, Worrick and Alex's flashbacks, Gangsta has neither good writing nor execution. \\n\\n\r\nThe entire series felt disjointed and fragmented, with the characters aimlessly shuffling through one poorly animated, forgettable vignette to the next.  Conflict built up from episodes 9 to 11 ends anticlimactically, with an final episode that fails to resolve the remaining plot threads.  \\n\r\nIt was very difficult to maintain any interest week by week, let alone care about minor characters that suddenly begin to \"matter.\"\\n\\n\r\nGangsta has no soundtrack to speak of, which only makes the show an even more low-key affair and frankly, the OP is better than some episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork begins on the cheap side of average, with uninteresting backgrounds, and suffers increasingly egregious off-model shots in both fight scenes and dialogue (such as episodes 8 and 9).  Poor art can be forgiven if other elements fall into place, but that is not the case here.\\n\\n\r\nGangsta has some clever moments, mostly Alex's character development, Nico's unique character and his past with Worrick. But the rest of the storylines unfold clumsily with no sense of urgency, drama or resolution.\\n\\n\r\nA comparison between Gangsta's 12 episodes and Black Lagoon's first cour reveals the difference in quality. The last episodes of Black Lagoon's first cour tie into and build upon themes of belonging that are raised beginning with episode 3, and ends on a self-contained high note with arc resolution and character development for its female and male leads.  All things considered, maybe it's lucky Manglobe's storyboarding team have just managed to stumble the show as far along as they have, unlike Bones and their handling of Blood Blockade Battlefront earlier this year.\\n\\n\r\nGangsta is probably better compared and contrasted with Darker than Black.  Both Darker than Black and Gangsta feature superpowered humans that work in the criminal underworld as a result of their superpowers.  Darker than Black offers noirish story arcs rather than action movie pacing.  Ultimately, both Gangsta and Darker than Black are about pleas for acceptance of the different and marginalized (Darker than Black's \"Contractors\").  \\n\\n\r\nHowever, Darker than Black features clever writing and compact, film noir storylines while Gangsta does not.  Darker than Black grounds its science fiction elements in real world politics, locations, and organizations, enough that character motivations and situations make sense despite the vague handwaving of how people acquired their powers.  It's a much better execution of a similar sci-fi/crime hybrid concept.   \\n",

            "content": "In the Ergastulum justice system, breaking any of the three laws is considered especially heinous. In Ergastulum, the dedicated individuals who investigate these vicious felonies are members of the laid-back duo known as the Benriya. These are their stories.\r\nIn the city of Ergastulum, violence, narcotics, and sex run rampant. For a series named Gangsta, it comes as an expectation of sorts. For anime, as a medium, an excess of violence, drugs, and real world sexual themes (doping prostitutes and pimping, which is far different than ecchi) are rarely put in place as a combination to form the core of a series. Gangsta utilizes this factand diligently puts it to use, allowing it to lure in those who are curious. In more ways than one, Gangsta comes off as a flashier mobster film equivalent from Western media.\\n\\n\r\nThe narrative of Gangsta follows the life of three main characters: Worick, Nicolas, and Alex. As Benriya (the Handymen), Worick and Nicolas are depicted as hired muscle doing odd jobs around the city, mainly for the big organized crime families \u2014 of which they are very acquainted with \u2014 and the police. The duo supposedly walk the line of neutrality, but it is seemingly a farce, given how deep they are affiliated with the powerful figures that run the city. The overall story of the series revolves around Twilights, people with enhanced, drug-induced capabilities which exceeds that of a normal person's by varying amounts. Their strength, or combat capabilities rather, are ranked from D to S, the latter being the highest. Like the case with all differences, being a Twilight brings upon discrimination. This acts as the main strife in the series, as increasing tensions build up around the city. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the environment of Ergastulum is eventful and entertaining, the direction that Gangsta moves towards often strays from a decisive path. This is one of the biggest issues that Gangsta has: the sub-plots are shallow and detract from the story as a whole. As one goes progresses through the series, countless characters come and go. New characters seem to pop up every couple of episodes, but you can never be sure if they're actually going to be anyone that's relevant; usually they aren't. Because of the amount of characters and their individual problems, there's simply too much information and too little time to present it. The series only just begins to get into the big conflict during the last third of the show but, even then, it ends abruptly at a cliffhanger.\\n\\n\r\nAnother aspect of the series that seemed very dull and recycled, to me at least, was the rankings of tags that the Twilights possess. To put it in honest terms, it's really just power-levels renamed. I'm personally not a big fan of power-levels being ranked; it takes a lot away from the potential of fights in a series since you already know who's stronger and projected to win. With that being said, the violence in Gangsta is probably still a great selling point for many. The fights aren't bad, but they leave something to be desired.\\n\\n\r\nAs previously mentioned, the amount of characters that Gangsta introduces in such a short amount of time is seriously astounding. We get enough backstory about Worick and Nicolas, obviously because they are the main duo, but there's not much regarding any of the supporting cast affiliated with the big families, the hunters, or the guild. Ginger? Gina Paulklee? Literally who? As one of the main characters, I was expecting a bit more out of Alex. Besides recovering from her destructive lifestyle as a prostitute, she doesn't do much else other than house sitting the Benriya bachelor pad. I understand the purpose behind Alex's character, but she feels a bit out of place and useless as a main character. Her struggles with coming clean adds a light element of a feel-good story, but she could have easily been just a supporting character and not much would have changed. From how the series portrays her, she appears to only serve as a staple that showcases how Worick and Nicolas are good guys. Oh, and fan service.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of visual quality, I thought that Manglobe did pretty well. Visually, the show appears to be a good adaptation of the manga. In terms of audio, Renegade, by the Stereo Dive Foundation, is memorable. The overall OST is also pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nWhether or not Gangsta can actually be considered good is up for debate and what you come to expect when defining something as actually good. In comparison to the rest of the Summer '15 season, it was certainly one of the better shows that aired, but that's simply because the season as a whole was quite barren. Ultimately, Gangsta had a lot of interesting ideas, and even potentially interesting characters, but none of that matters if it is not utilized.",

            "content": "\"As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a Gangster.\" - Henry Hill (Goodfellas) \r\nWhen Gangsta first rolled up onto the scene in its '64 Impala, I thought to myself- wow, this show is going to be great. It wowed us with some cool characters who weren't schoolkids, a gritty underworld type setting, and some ultraviolence not seen in a long time. Surely, this show had the makings of being the new Black Lagoon- an anime held in high esteem by many viewers for its portrayal of a true crime drama and high action blockbuster feel. \r\nWell, let's find out. \r\nArtworkand Animation: 6\\n\\n\r\nGangsta is Manglobe's long awaited return to prominence after a run of relative quietness, and they're back with a bang. At times, Gangsta looks absolutely fantastic, with some awesome cityscape drops and dirty, grungy looking streets full of seedy activity. The city of Ergastulum really feels like a haven for criminal activity- and the subdued color mood of the show, lots of greys and browns lend to this atmosphere. The character designs are quite nice as well, no ridiculous spider people like in Code Geass, nor any stupidly disproportionate females. In other words, they manage to make people look like people without breaking the laws of physics. \\n\\n\r\nThe other side of the coin is that at times it feels really low budget. Certain areas are reused fairly often, and the character detail level is inconsistent throughout, but overall good. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound and Voice Acting: 9\\n\\n\r\nEnter the first anime character I've ever seen with a disability that affects their communication with others. I have to hand it to Kenjirou Tsuda and Brandon Potter for the portrayal of the deaf Nicolas Brown. Ian Sinclair's performance is also top notch with the suave, smooth talking Worick. The rest of the characters are voiced appropriately- crooked cops, menacing sounding thugs, gangsters, and other criminals. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\\n\r\nGangsta definitely puts two interesting characters in the driver's seat- Nick and Worick. Nick, as mentioned above- is deaf. He communicates mostly with his fists, but also sign language in some more tender moments. We're shown that he actually can speak, but he's been deaf for so long that it's affected his speech, leading to this very slurred manner of speaking. Nick's fighting skills are nearly unparalleled in the city of Ergastulum, and as a member of a group known as \"(dog)tags\" or \"twilights\", he's a very respected fighter among them. \\n\\n\r\nWorick, on the other hand, is much more of the cool man, and much more thoughtful and less impulsive than Nick, making them excellent partners. Worick handles the business deals of their illicit activities and keeps up appearances with mafia bosses and persons of influence- all while making a few bucks on the side with some bedside business. He also keeps Nick in check when tensions run high, and others get higher. \\n\\n\r\nOne issue that I do have with Gangsta regarding characters though is the introduction of lots of new characters right before the ending of the show. Over the course of 12 episodes, it had picked up a lot as it were, with multiple crime families, factions, and other random people, but the ending is just silly with new characters that I don't have time to care about, let alone know their names. \\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5\\n\\n\r\nGangsta started off as a gritty tale of a pair of criminals who would do dirty jobs that even the crooked cops wouldn't touch. Doing jobs for friends, mafia bosses for that almighty petty cash, anything goes in the underworld. Murder, sex, drugs, alcohol, prostitution, It's all there. We really get a feel for how seedy this city is- glorifying violence and just how much money really talks. Where it started strong, giving us a very detailed background on the city and how each other players in it came to be, once again, approaching the end it all started coming unraveled. Take Black Lagoon, for example. It manages to introduce multiple mafia factions and bosses, interesting/nasty arc-based villains, a lot of side characters, and kept them relevant to the plot throughout the entire show. Everything was tied back to these characters who managed to survive.\\n\\n\r\nIn Gangsta, there are a ton of loose ends left just because they tried to shove so many different characters in to make the story stretch out just a little further. When a show gets so convoluted that I lose track of who was with what group and what was happening- then you have a problem. I take shows like Serial Experiments Lain and Ergo Proxy as examples here: they're intentionally made to be complex and intricate. \\n\r\nGangsta gets needlessly complicated at the end, for no real reason. As the great Mr Plinkett once said: \"You're not making \"The Usual Suspects\" here, so keep it nice and simple!\" With a lot of good violence and characterization with characters we already had, there was no need to cram 10 more in there behind them for some semblance of depth. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEven after the ending, I still don't remember which of the myriad of characters were associated with what faction and trying to defend this or that, or who were important twilights, or what their ranks were or if any of that even mattered! \\n\\n\r\nI don't see why it couldn't have just stayed a core group of individuals involved in an arc based, or even one single cohesive conflict. Instead, we get an anime that has no story direction. I don't know what the conflict in Gangsta really was, because violence against Twilights was always there. It didn't just start in the course of the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe final strike against the story, though is that nothing is resolved at the end. It loses a lot of focus around episode 10, and ends in a very unraveled set of threads. I don't know if it's a setup for a second season that's not been greenlit, but it's got a total non ending. Not even an open ending, just a non.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\\n\r\nAs I said above, Gangsta started out very strongly, and I was really into it. I liked the action, how it didn't pull any punches with ultraviolence, and that it was gritty and unapologetic. I still like that about the show. However, what was a bit offputting to me was the inclusion of superpowers. In a gang based crime drama set on the mean streets of anywhere USA (or Japan, whatever) you generally (read never) have superpowers factor into the equation. The fact that characters in this show could take drugs and then turn into a super hero with Spiderman-like jumping, strength, and sensing abilities, and incredible, greater than human reflexes, it kind of killed suspense in several parts of the show. Then came the Tokyo Ghoul style one-upping of each character's power. \"Oh this guy's a rank SuperUltraMetaOverkill?\" \"Well, this chick is a HyperUberMonsterBoss class!\" and it just went on and on from there... totally ruining their hierarchy/scale of skill and abilities. \\n\\n\r\nThere's a lot to like about Gangsta though- it's a very serious show with no fanservice, no horrifiyingly bad dialogue, and a good basis for a tale, it's just a shame that it kind of wraps its 64' Impala around a telephone pole at the end. Oh well, like Eazy said- just say \"oh brotha. Throw it in the gutta, and go buy another.\"\\n\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr\\n\\n\r\n+ Good characters and a very cool setting\\n\r\n+ Good action and visual effects\\n\\n\r\n+/- Pacing is iffy, and side characters appear once and sometimes never again, leaving a lot of side stories unfinished\\n\\n\r\n- Non ending, show gets derailed and unfocused starting about episode 10\\n\\n\\n\r\nRecommend? \\n\\n\r\nYes, definitely a standout of the summer 2015 season, but not great enough to be a new Black Lagoon.\\n\\n\r\n\"Damn it feels good to be a gangsta\" - Geto Boys",

            "content": "Seventh Review - GANGSTA. \r\nWere do I begin talking about this, At first I was a bit bored but then it picked up, This is more of an adults anime rather than a younger audience anime and you have to pay attention to detail or you can easily get confused. \r\nI started liking this anime and it reminded me a lot like Black Lagoon in some ways as it was about gangs and guns, however as you carry on watching it it's actually very different. The plot is unique and strange, you have to understand it in order to like this anime, you have tobe able to get in the right mind or you won't like it. The plot is pretty simple, two handymen or 'assassin-like' people and a girl in the line of dirty work. The plot picks up at the end mainly where some 'strangers' come into the mix and everything goes mayhem. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters I personally liked, I found them very interesting to get to know, especially as it shows you their pasts bit by bit. I personally liked Alex as her past was hidden a lot until the end. I love the uniqueness that was given to each character. Some characters were shown as 'stronger' than others and this gave you the feeling of authority that was around the city. You could see who was the underlings and who was the boss, It was great that the anime didn't pay attention to just some characters but shown you a variety of them, and not all are gangsta bosses, they would be a simple 'cigarette seller' or 'doctor'. \\n\\n\r\nThe art was great for this sort of anime, it was in detail and you could keep up with the style. For the genre the anime is I thought that the art work was generally good and it kept me liking the anime more. \\n\\n\r\nHonestly, some people hate this anime but for me I loved it, it had enjoyment from it. I admit some areas you got bored or had to rewind to understand what was going on but if you managed to keep up then it was a good anime. I am looking forward to more of this, I held of for a week because I didn't want it to end and now i know there more to come I'm happy and excited. If you like action, gang-violence and a rough style then I would recommend you give this a try. \\n\\n\r\nCanaan~",

            "content": "basically only doing a review because of the lack of good reviews. This anime's only downside is that it ends without any real ending. Assuming there is more this is going to be an amazing series. I'm equating the bad reviews to them being done and found helpful by children who aren't yet capable enough of mind to understand what is going on in the show. That or they just can't handle mature themes. One of the \"most helpful\" reviews complained of the presence of prostitution and the even positive way that it is depicted. Yes this is a very progressive show and has manyviewpoints that might clash with the typical brainwashed sheep. They're probably voting for Trump. This show was incredibly deep and progressive in ways i've never seen in anime before. Prostitution was portrayed in a way that didn't shame the prostitutes. The leading character is a deaf man and spends the majority of the anime making you think he's the biggest strongest bad ass in town which may yet be true. It shows very realistic experiences of people living through traumatic events and perhaps the typical person can't relate to any true trauma. the way they show these victims such as the prostitutes being drugged and dependent on those abusing them despite the horror of it. One of the bad reviews complained of the ranking system of the tags like they have any sort of actual relevance. Once you've watched it through you see that these rankings represent very little and this is particularly true of the main cast of the show. This show has a depth of realities that i've never seen represented so well in what comes down to being simply a cartoon. To those submitting negative reviews, you'll understand when you're older.",

            "content": "An Ergastulum was a building in ancient Rome, they were designed as prisons to hold in chains dangerous slaves, or punish them. They were essentially subsurface pits built deeply into the ground\u2014large enough to allow the slaves to work within it and containing narrow spaces in which they slept. Must\u2019ve been one hell of a place to survive in. Based on Kohske\u2019s manga, Gangsta shows you a different Ergastulum, it\u2019s the name of an actual city, one devoid of law. The mafia runs the city with an iron fist, it\u2019s a dog eat dog world, a city where the living and death interact and sex,money, drugs and violence are the necessary evils to survive. Its survival of the fittest and while not exactly a prison, it might as well be with the philosophical governing to the likes of the movie, \u2018I-Robot\u2019. It\u2019s gritty, ugly, rough, graphic in detail and downright bleak and it's fascinating to watch all those who thrive within.\\n\\n\r\nGangsta tells the complex and grief-filled story of gangsters, or rather, the \u2018Handymen\u2019, two men-for-hire who take on various jobs from citizens and criminal organisations in the fictional city of Ergastulum, like body-guarding, money-collection and home repairs. The city takes a close representation of Italy during the mafia era, except it is governed in the background by the \u2018Four Fathers\u2019\u20143 mafia families and a mercenary guild. Thieves, drugs, prostitutes, shady doctors and corrupted cops are plot essentials and as the series unfolds, so does the mystery that surrounds the creation of Ergastulum. Our main protagonists, Worick Arcangelo and Nicolas Brown are neutral contractors who stay out of underworld politics so they can be called upon by anyone who can pay. While seemingly amoral, the pair saves a prostitute named Alex Benedetto from her abusive pimp and give her a place to stay, and as an outsider, Alex acts as the audience\u2019s fresh perspective into the Handymen\u2019s grim and terrifying day-to-day lives, where murder is graphically and unapologetically portrayed.\\n\\n\r\nAfter an unspecified war in the early 20th century, many soldiers came back to Ergastulum dependent on a weaponised drug called \u2018Celebrer\u2019 and their children were born with its debilitating effects. They were given the label \u2018Twilights\u2019, these offspring are capable of superhuman strength and are exploited by criminal gangs as slaves, who openly fight and kill each other in the back streets without fear of prosecution. Twilights are heavily discriminated against, so they are tagged by the government to keep track of them to keep them in line. Many \u2018Tags\u2019 opt to work for Ergastulum\u2019s mafia families regardless and as a result, the show features some bloody massacres by criminal Twilights who carry out hits against \u2018Normals\u2019 and often times have high-intensity battles against their own, sizing each other up based on the rank displayed on the tags they wear which are based on strength. Many are essentially slaves, unable to escape the city, its crime or its vices. However, the balance is upheld by the Four Fathers and the 3 laws are imposed on the Twilights\u2014Never take action against a Normal, obey your master and defend yourself if it does not conflict with the first two rules. With such a show which depicts superhuman abilities, the effects of evolution would eventually come into play. Those that use Celebrer have a shortened lifespan to compensate for their abilities.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Gangsta mostly focuses on the day-to-day lives and the pasts of our main protagonists, each episode gradually explores the underlying tension between the four criminal families of Ergastulum and the Twilights which eventually culminates in an all-out gang war with Nick and Worick caught in the middle of it. While Alex is first terrified of her saviours, we get to see the terrible ordeals both Handymen went through and how their work ultimately aims to rid the city of its worst so the few good souls they care about can live without fear. Thankfully, while mostly a serious show, there is a splash of humour and light-hearted moments every so often which makes the cast more endearing, although in saying that, these moments never betray the dark and gritty atmosphere. Gangsta\u2019s mystery surrounding its characters is built up slowly to give enough time for each character\u2019s pasts to be explored and explained. Worick is the face of the Handymen and the most visible protagonist; a smooth-talking one-eyed businessman with an easy-going nature that masks his darker tendencies, and his immunity to violence ends up a lot more understandable once the audience gets to learn his past as an abused illegitimate mafia child. \\n\\n\r\nAlex is a sweet young woman seemingly caught up in trafficking exploitation and trapped in Ergastulum who becomes a whole lot more saddening once her withdrawals are exposed. Nicolas is a silent and menacing Tag who also happens to be deaf and Celebrer-dependent, acting as the muscle but gradually revealed to be far more than just another soulless murderer. Nick is easily the highlight of the show and it is rare to see a character in anime with a disability (deaf), yet the writing and voice actors (both sub and dub) do a great job of treating it with respect while making it an integral part of his character, rather than a gimmick existing solely for spectacle. Much of the narrative in Gangsta is conveyed via out-of-order flashbacks which require your full attention to get the most out of it and understand the underworld politics engulfing their city. You\u2019ll be treated to some of the most satisfying fight scenes and faction face-offs in recent years, thanks to the violence-laden nature of Ergastulum and its sick past. Nicolas is featured in the majority of these combat scenes as a troubled Twilight himself, though thanks to his deafness and continued abuse of Celebrer to numb his pain, is relatively unique in his menace as most other Tags and Normals don\u2019t know what to do with him.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation in Gangsta which is done by Manglobe are spectacular! Character designs of our featured trio are very distinctive, they look like people who have gone through a lot of life\u2019s darkest paths. Also liked how they have different clothes for different episodes, it\u2019s always a welcomed concept. The colour palette is dark, drab and shadowy with muted hues of the sprawling Ergastulum, allowing the copious amounts of crimson blood and rare instances of colour shown to stand out fantastically in action sequences\u2014which are fast and furious with amazing choreography. Very fluid with the great use of camera angles and Matrix-like slo-mo bullet time effects. The moody soundtrack was done by Tsutchie (Samurai Champloo and Cowboy Bebop), whether it\u2019s a quiet conversation or tense stand-off, also fit the gritty tone of the show perfectly. A mixture of sorts with techno, drum \u2018n\u2019 bass and jazzy beats. Voice acting has solid performances all around. Opening and Ending are incredibly great with \"Renegade\" by STEREO DIVE FOUNDATION, is an epic upbeat dubstep track while, Yoru no Kuni by Annabel, is an emotional ballad about hope and looking towards the future. Both feel interconnected, and the lyrics fit very well to the storyline.\\n\\n\r\nGangsta is raw in all its depiction, realistically showing you the underbelly of the criminal world and a dysfunctional society. It handles most themes successfully by tackling these societal problems in a mature way, giving you a different perspective from the victim\u2019s point of view. We all understand that the actions shown throughout the series are looked down upon, but yet, when it confronts us upfront, emotions are left stirred and disrupted in an uncomfortable manner and it's relentlessly brutal in its attack on your moral compass. It\u2019s a great action seinen that evokes plenty of emotion. It\u2019s a character-driven story with an equally compelling plot that has high style and great substance moulded together, although it is held back from being one of the greats by an abrupt ending. During production, Manglobe filed for bankruptcy which sucks. Because of this unfortunate event, there isn\u2019t a true ending and we can only hope that one day we can see a continuation from a different studio. It deserves a much better legacy.\\n",

            "content": "DISCLAIMER: I did not read the manga. This review should be taken as an anime-only perspective. This WAS my most favorite anime last summer season until it showed its ugly head. What happened?!\r\nThe Highlights \r\nCharacter Development: Great for the first eight episodes\r\nThe Hunters: Unnecessary addition which stagnated the show overall\r\nPlot: Evenly paced but desperately needs a sequel\r\nEnding: The most inconclusive ending this season\r\nArtwork and Animation: Often passable but terrible at times \r\nGangsta. will always be a shining example of how terrible animation can destroy the mood of the show and why not to adapt a manga which is still on its world building phase.\r\nTo behonest, this has the most compelling premise and characters this season which was unfortunately given a very low budget for its own good. The staff has done a few tricks to cover that problem via zooming in and out some of the scenes and the use of still images but it shows its ugly head when the characters engage in action. Character expressions were awful and deformed during close ups and drawn poorly when distant. The fight scenes are dragging and the character movements are really stiff.\\n\\n\r\nA viewer whose priority is the visual appeal will be turned off by how sluggish the animation could be and will find himself dropping this show once he reaches episode 9 which is really unfortunate for Gangsta because of its masterful storytelling for the first eight episodes. Exposition in particular can be a double edged sword as it ruined Fate Stay Night's great moments but this anime showed that it can be used to further enrich the plot while also entertaining the audience. In Gangsta's case, we were not spoonfed by dull narration but the staff decided to show us tidbits of their past and what drove them to what they are right now. Episodes six and seven in particular were the best episodes this summer season which explained what Alex, Worrick and Nicholas were like in the past and man, these are two episodes which seamed heartwarming and cold scenes seamlessly. \\n\\n\r\nWhile not new in terms of plot, this was executed properly at least for the first eight episodes. The show excelled when it presents the character interaction between the leads and the intricacies of its story when taken to a larger picture. Moreover, Gangsta.'s ambitious when it comes to its world building since its premise was thoroughly explained, from Alex' reason to stay in town to the powers that be whose interaction was fragile enough to exude an uncomfortable feeling when we are watching this show. This however, faltered the show's quality because it has only an episode left to iron out multiple plot line and it failed to do so.\\n\\n\r\nThe character interaction is also excellent too. The Handymen plus Alex are quite a pleasure to watch. Their backgrounds were sufficiently provided and man, this is not your typical sad or bubbly flashback. Only a few anime series give detail to all other minor characters while not forgetting the main leads and Gangsta. is one of those. If we are to base Gangsta's merit for the first eight episodes, I have no reservation to say that it was the best anime last summer.\\n\\n\r\nNOW WHAT WENT WRONG WITH GANGSTA?\\n\\n\r\nGiven that the artwork is a mess in Gangsta. (see episode 9), the story should at least be complete and compelling. The balance between action and character drama was stable until the end of episode eight then its ugly head showed afterwards.\\n\\n\r\nThe inclusion of the Hunters and the sudden shift to focus on the larger events in Ergastulum marred this already flawed show. The intimate relationship it built with its viewers were destroyed the moment we were presented the Hunter's psychotic demeanor and shounen like powers. Their motives for killing Twilights were never explained and they did not add anything to the complexities of Ergastulum. With the abrupt focus in the city and the addition of these characters, Gangsta. was reduced to your generic dark anime. Character interaction between the leads is now sporadic from episodes nine onwards to give way to new characters which we barely know. How can a viewer possibly care for dozens of new characters in a span of three episodes?\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is mostly good in this show. However, there are moments when it is weirdly placed. Doug's death scene could be a compelling one due to all the direction the staff has given but was inserted with very upbeat tone which destroyed its poignancy. Another misstep is the sudden cut of the lovely piano piece at the end of episode 5 which is thankfully still an elegant episode by all means.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, this is not the biggest flaw of the anime adaptation of Gangsta. If we are going to base the quality of each episode, I still think it is a fine show. It seemed like the staff and the publisher forgot that the manga is still on its early phase but still decided to animate the show. The series ended right in the middle of the large war it created and it caught up with the manga. New characters are barely introduced, the main leads' resolve are nowhere to be seen and the Hunters continue to ruin the show with their shonen-esque attributes. There is no resolution and we were given a finale which is a good episode in its own but a letdown as a series ender.\\n\\n\r\nWill we be able to see the next season? No. It was a shame that this anime was adapted a season too early so we will never be able to see the end of the current arc. The staff could've done an anime original ending but they still stick to adapt this one faithfully until the end which really backfired. Ugh.",

            "content": "Gangsta, spelled that way because proper spelling wouldn't be extreme enough, is an ongoing manga created by Kohske that started in 2011. In 2015, Manglobe did an anime adaptation, finishing it slightly before the studio declared bankruptcy. This is their last work to be released right now. There's a film, Genocidal Organ, that was supposed to open shortly after this series ended but, given the situation, it's uncertain when it will open at this time. So, how is Gangsta as the Studio's last series, possibly ever?\r\nStory:\r\nNicolas and Worick are Handymen, which is the term used for mercenaries in this series. Because calling them mercs wouldn'tbe special enough. In the crime-filled city of Ergastulum, they take jobs that no one else will. We get to see the two of them work for the police, Mafia and back alley doctors. During a mission for the police, the two exterminate an upstart gang of thugs and take in a prostitute, Alex, as their assistant. Offering her a new life. But everything isn't kosher in Ergastulum. Someone's encroaching on the city and breaking its rules, which could result in problems for everybody.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest issue with the series is the ending. Like Code Geass, Gangster doesn't feature any kind of resolution. Rather, it ends on a bombastic note with everything seemingly going wrong and a lot of cliff hangers. The big difference between this and Code Geass is that Sunrise was stable when they released the first series of that and Manglobe... well, who even knows at this juncture if they'll be able to continue in the wake of their bankruptcy. Putting that aside, there's also an issue with the world building, mainly the overuse of exposition and flashbacks. The series expends a lot of time on discussing their people with superhuman abilities, how the city's rules work and a lot of it is done through clunky exposition or overly long flashbacks.\\n\\n\r\nOn the positive side, the series features a lot of interesting conflicts with some strong sources of tension. In spite of the somewhat sloppy execution, I will also credit the world building for having some good ideas that may very well have developed into something really good. I also appreciate that the missions get a lot of variation and the back story for how Nicolas and Worick partnered up has some really strong elements to it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThis series has a really strong cast of characters. Both the major and minor characters have a lot going for them, even with a lot of the minor characters having fairly minimal use. There are great interactions with these characters as well. Worick and Nicolas have a great dynamic. I also really like the scenes with Nicolas and Nina. They're actually really sweet.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork in this is quite good. The character designs are well done. The action sequences are strong and there are a lot of really good details. It's definitely up to Manglobe's usual standards.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThere are some really good performances in this. Tsuda Kenjirou does a really good job providing the voice for our deaf protagonist. It definitely has that quality that you get when an actual deaf person speaks where they can approximate the sounds but they aren't sure what the words actually sound like so it's a bit off. Suwabe Junichi, Noto Mamiko & Yuuki Aoi all give strong performances as well. There aren't any bad performances, but those four are the ones who really stood out. The music is more mediocre. It isn't bad but it's not good either. It's there and it's serviceable.\\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nThere's a scene where two of the minor female characters are shown in bed together in a way that illustrates quite strongly that they are, at the very least, having sex but it's late in the series and they aren't characters we spend a lot of time with, so the extent of their relationship beyond that is unclear. Alex also gets groped by another woman at one point, but the woman in question is shown as being in a relationship with a man and the scene is just kind of odd and out of place. So, it's probably safe to say it's not important.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nGangster is a pretty enjoyable series. It has some solid ideas, good tension, some really strong characters, solid art and strong voice acting. It is, however, weakened by an ending that resolves nothing, bland music and a general abuse of exposition & flashback scenes. Overall, I give it a 7/10. If the premise sounds interesting to you, give it a go. Next week I'm looking at Rurouni Kenshin: Meiji Kenkaku Romantan- Tsuiokuhen.",

            "content": "Don't pay any mind to any of the other clearly-misguided reviews on this particular anime that are ranking it so low.  The only thing, and I mean ONLY thing wrong with this anime is the length and where it abruptly ends.  It was quite clear the company ran out of money by the last couple of episodes.  This is potentially a story that could have gone on as long as Monster or Rurouni Kenshin and still stayed interesting, but it didn't.\r\nBoth of the main characters are older, neither of them having internal psychological wars with themselves as to whether or not theyshould do what they're going to do.  They both have a general sense of purpose that is completely lacking in so many typical Shounen animes of today.  The main characters are clearly friends, with deep backstories and a believable friendship that makes itself persistently obvious over the course of 12 episodes.  \\n\\n\r\nThe dub is great, one of the main characters is deaf but it is voiced so extremely well that I REALLY liked this difference in the overall cast setup.  For once the characters are actually older than me too, in their mid+ 30s.  Their friendship is organic and believable, the terms of their coming together is both rich and deep.  Very easy to sympathize and see why they became friends over the course of watching the first season.\\n\\n\r\nThe feminazis might have an issue with this show, as it starts out with the classic stereotypically fan-service stacked females, one of which is saved from a life of prostitution and rescued by these darker 'knights in shining armor'.  It develops quickly though.  Everyone's a jiggalo, not just the females, which I think serves to even the Feminist playing field.  The chick still gets stuck with the role of helpless secretary / nanny (she gets stuck with taking care of a baby in one episode).   \\n\\n\r\nThe story is your classic \"born a certain power-level, get stronger and push your power level higher by defeating stronger foes and/or overdosing on a drug\".  It's still quite good and fits with the overall atmosphere.  The backstory is great, from what I got of the first season, but incomplete.  A lot of unanswered questions / content for at least one extra future season.  Hopefully they'll bring it back.  I'll give it a 7.5 until then, although with another season this show could easily be another Cowboy Beebop.. with much less digression from the overall storyline.   \\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10 - I do recommend.  It's like samurai x meets DBZ meets something dark with medium-strong sexual undertones.",

Well, okay, let's give it a try. \\n\\n\r\nAnd there I was hoping not to write anything in English here. Well, now I'm sorta forced to do so. Anyway, let's get started. \\n\\n\r\nNot to offend anyone, but I don't understand people's complains about this anime \"being a total disaster\" or whatsoever. To me, it was pretty good. I would dare say awesome, actually. Donno what everyone expected to see, hear, but you can't deny the artwork, the sounds, the characters. I myself don't like protagonists in any way, considering I hate it when a smart (to be more precise, a genius) guy lets himself into a situation and the lifestyle of doormat & homeless stray - JUST DON'T GET IT. But hey, that's just me. I don't care why the characters act the way I would never, because that's none of my business. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot. The story. Didn't get it quite clear. That's why I should probably stick to the manga some time soon. \\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned before (or didn't I?), the visual part and the music. Oh holy dear neurons of head of mine. It was nighttime, nothing made a sound, earphones were on my head, and the brightening of laptop's LCD. My words look like something went wrong with me right now, and that might be true. Just a glimpse of recalling the night I watched this anime already makes me feel like a teenage underpuberty girl, who stands close to her idol Santa Clause or smth. Yeah, right, that's totally an exaggeration, but I'm telling you. The meal was good, I enjoyed it.",

            "content": "Story: 1\r\nGangsta had a phenomenal beginning but unfortunately, quickly fell into a tedium which then deteriorated into a poor plot with little explanation.\r\nUnfortunately, gangsta did not live up to its initial hype. While the first episode was amazing as it provided a well balance between action and exposition which established to the audience as to what to expect: ultra violence and shady dealings. However, several episodes later, it still could not establish a plot and it really just became a \u201cGangsta no nichijou\u201d or \u201cThe everyday lives of gangsta\u201d at that point. When it does finally introduce a plot of some degree it\u2019s so poorlyexecuted and explained that it may as well have been written by a primary schooler. Basically the plot becomes: a new organisation wants to overthrow the established powers. And the reason why this plot is poorly executed is that very little is explained to the audience and all we\u2019re given is just a bunch of fight scenes between Twilights. So basically at this point it\u2019s like watching two idiots slugging it at each other and waiting to see who falls down first.\\n\\n\r\nThe other problem is that, with whatever time it has left, it is spent explaining backstories of its characters. Not that there\u2019s anything wrong with backstories, but having no developing plot means that I may as well be reading LoL character pages. In fact, reading LoL character pages is probably more enjoyable than watching several episodes of backstories. And lastly, the show fails to give any actual conclusion and everything is just left open, so open that that the audience is unable to imagine a conclusion because there isn't enough information.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the lack of an actual, gripping story which it tries to fill in with violence was what made this show become as disappointing as it did.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThe character designs are alright, but the backgrounds really helped develop the mood and feel of the setting. The faded out, dull backgrounds helped establish a slum-like feel.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nThe OP is exceptional, both visually and musically, the ED is alright but not as good as the OP. The BGM is nothing memorable and is often just forgotten in lieu of focusing on the fighting scenes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9 \\n\r\nProbably the forte of gangsta. Gangsta has been able to develop their characters quite well through dialogue and interaction scenes. We even get a good sense of support characters due to their characters actually being explored, as well as how they relate to both the main characters and other supports. However, one thing I cannot get over is Alex\u2019s character. Her existence is utterly contrived and she adds very little to the story and even development of the main characters, even though she\u2019s literally next to them most of the time. She seems to be some kind of emotion device in that we\u2019re supposed to feel sorrow/empathy for her at certain scenes but it comes out so forced that they may as well have put a \u2018feel sad here\u2019 textbox in her stead.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4\\n\r\nIf I had to rate the first episode alone, I\u2019d have given it an 8. But as the series stretched on, it became clearer and clearer that it would be a mindlessly, nonsensically violent show that would rely more or less on its action scenes. The fights between twilight and gun users became stale after a few scenes as the gun users posed no threat. Twilights appear to move faster than bullets while the gun users seem to contain one of two traits: they either can\u2019t aim or they take several decades to pull the trigger which allows the Twilight to throw stuff at them or just run up and slash them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5\\n\r\nI was really hoping that this would be an anime that would redeem this season\u2019s collection of lacklustre titles. Unfortunately, the overreliance of blood and gore to excite viewers quickly wears off and the poorly contrived plot makes this show dismissable.\\n",

            "content": "Gangsta. is an anime that could have been godlike but instead it was 'fine'. A show to pass the time. \r\n-Story: 4\r\nThere are \"Twilights\" and \"normals\" -> Twilights are stronger than normals, to the point that they can dodge bullets and kill you with their bare hands. But Twilights need a drug called \"Celebrer\" to survive, a drug that normals fabricate (couldn't twilights learn how to fabricate some nice drugs? Really?).\r\nLots of normals hate twilights and some use 'em as slaves (despite twilights are so bloody strong they could put humanity at their feet), some kill 'em, very few actually help 'em. That's the contextwhere our protagonists (one twilight, one normal) try to survive doing whatever they can.\\n\r\nThe plot is well paced and quite intriguing in the first 8 episodes, then it is so rushed and so bad developed that it left a bad taste in my mouth.  In addition, the end has a lot of plot holes that makes you wish for a second season, but it will never come since Manglobe (the studio that produced the show) filed for bankruptcy.\\n\\n\r\n-Art: 7\\n\r\nI really liked a lot the art and it fits in a satisfactory way, but the animation was... well, a little bit disappointing.\\n\\n\r\n-Sound: 7\\n\r\nEvery character had its right seiyuu. I did not found any character with a voice not fitting with his/her personality.\\n\r\nThe OST is fine; nothing memorable except Alex performance in chapter 8. That song suited very nice with the chapter events.\\n\\n\r\n-Characters: 7\\n\r\nNico is a captivating character with a dark past. Same as Worrick, despite he is not captivating, but rather \"the guy that acts cool\". Alex is a hot gyal that used to be a prostitute and her development was well done. These three are the main protagonists of the show and their personalities are well developed. Not as the other. There are intriguing characters, each with a story to tell, like Marco, Paulklee, Dany,... but due to lack of money (what means lack of episodes, A LOT OF EPISODES) we got a show with enormous plot holes for almost every character.\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment: 7\\n\r\nI did enjoy the show besides its end.\\n\\n\r\n-Overall: 6\\n\r\nGangsta. had a huge potential to be a great show, sadly it is not.",

            "content": "Plot and Story Line\r\nThe whole Gangsta story is set in a small town named Ergastulum. When it comes to the city, it is a very dark, shady ville full of thieves, whores, corrupt cops and gangs. I think you all can imagine it in one way. In the heart of the story we have the two main characters: Worick and Nicolas. Two partners that do all kinds of odd jobs that nobody else wants to do. Now the thing that makes Gangsta different from other shows are Twilights. Twilights posses enchanted abilities due to their predecessors' use of Celebrer (some kind of drug). They arenoted for being incredibly violent and destructive and as such mostly hired for killing jobs. One of the Twilights in this anime is also Nick.\\n\r\nIn the show, a new character is introduced right in the beginning. A prostitute called Alex. She meets after Worick and Nick were assigned to kill Alex's boss. In the end Alex ends up as the one killing her boss, and kinda teaming up with Worick and Nick. \\n\r\nI know you might be asking \"Is that it?\", and yeah that's basically it. That's the whole plot, but it is not a bad one. Here's why.\\n\r\nThe plot and story line are really slow. It is a step by step, firstly character introduction, then a \"setting introduction\" and at some points a flash-back story. The story gets all interesting in the ninth episode when so called \"Anti-Twilights\" appear. A battle between them starts and is still ongoing but the first season ended today. There are still no information about season two, but have hope, because the anime is actually manga based. We don't know for sure, but I think that season two will be aired because of the huge popularity that this anime has. \"Fingers crossed\". \\n\r\nNow the main thing that kept me watching Gangsta. The flashbacks and backstories. The story about Worick and Nick and how they meet is outstanding. I loved it and it really gets emotional in some parts. It's a story about friendship, humanity and family relations, so I recommend you not to miss it. There are also two more backstories that have my attention. The first one  is the backstory of Delico (Twilight) and his sibling sister Erica (Anti-twilight). I just think that for now the anime didn't give them the limelight they deserve. One more is also a sibling story, but now of Alex and her brother Emilio. These two backgroundstories have on thing in common (except the sibling part). They are still unfinished and left some questions in the first season, and that's exactly why I think that we can hope for a second season to air. \\n\r\nAlso an important thing that has to be mentioned is that this anime is perfect for all you action lovers out there. Epic and interesting fights. Guns, axes, swords...There are all kinds of weapons. It has some bloodshed, but  hey, as if you are not used to it. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nThe characters in Gangsta are just a bunch of badass gangsters, killer machines and ordinary characters that are there \"just because\". Some of them develop in one or the other way, and some of them are interesting due to their past, Delico for instance. Now here for you our two main guys, and my personal favorite in the show. \\n\\n\r\nWorick Arcangelo is a damn clever and brilliant person. In his cruel childhood he escaped his horrible reality trough books. Now he possesses the ability to read incredibly fast and the ability of photographic memory. Although being rich and having everything \"served on a silver-plate\" he just wanted a place to belong to. He finds a place next to Nick, or so he thinks. But does he really belongs in the world of Twilights by pretending or acting like one?   \\n\\n\r\nNIckolas (Nick) Brown. This guy is a Twilight. He is an incredible fighter and a killer machine, but he has a huge heart. A very considerate and nice person but not looking like one. The most interesting thing about Nick is his inability to talk. The way he uses sing language to communicate and how others interact with him is awesome. He is a \"Fake\", meaning he reaches his tag of A/0 by overdosing. He is actually ranked as B/5. Still his swordsman skills are outstanding. I loved seeing him fight. \\n\\n\r\nDoug looks like a 14-year-old kid, but is actually a grown up. Looking innocent but actually wearing an A/0 Tag. Quite dangerous. Doug is a side-character in Gangsta but I loved him because he looks so cute but is a killer machine in the same time. I have the feeling that I just want to squeeze his cheeks and say: \"You little devil, stop killing people\". I just wish we could have seen more of him in Gangsta.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Style\\n\r\nLadies and Gentlemen, welcome to 2015. You can clearly see the difference, or easier said, the better animation in the anime of 2014/2015. Gangsta is one of those. Awesome animation. Smooth, good contrast, clear, good colors and outline. In short, I loved it. \\n\r\nThe style is also from a new generation. The high contrast shadows gave it a good taste and the good work with details made it incredible. \\n\r\nNow one more thing that has to be mentioned is definitely the music. It is epic. For example the opening. It is catchy and the only anime-opening I didn't skip while watching. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\r\nConclusions were always my favorite part of every speech, essay and review because I put all my thoughts in a few sentences and as if you will remember everything you read above. \\n\r\nNow to conclude, Gangsta is a dark anime that tells a story about friendship and humanity. It is realistic in some parts but becomes an \"anime\" after some time. Full of action, heart breaking stories and interesting characters. I rate it as a 8.45, minus points for the slow story development, but on the whole definitely worth watching it. I'd give it a try!\\n\\n\r\nYour AnimeGirl",

            "content": "It\u2019s not often you see an anime putting its setting into uncharted territory. It is a welcoming addition to the constant routine of anime studios just churning out shows that present a Japanese environment so that a Japanese audience can be easily engaged. With a unique setting backed by an equally unique title, Gangsta, that will at least be an excellent first impression going into it. What came through my mind when Gangsta was over was how much of a great thrill ride it was, except for the bumpy journey that was part of it.\r\nGangsta\u2018s setting is not the only thing that makes it unique.The characters and subject matter the writers created and produced had a stark, gritty tone to them that was interesting enough to keep me hooked. This type of direction they chose is honestly one of the stronger feats to Gangsta.  Another anime that delved into this similar atmosphere was Black Lagoon, however, the way Gangsta and Black Lagoon treated their atmosphere are entirely different. Black Lagoon was trying to invoke black comedy in its story and characters, while Gangsta\u2019s felt more serious and focused less on humor. I can appreciate both of these types of atmospheres equally if the writers can add substance to them that make them engaging. It\u2019s just unfortunate that Gangsta can\u2019t seem to figure this point out when trying to make a cohesive narrative to complement its atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nIn the beginning, I was hooked by the story and how well they introduced the characters. The build-up was great by the first half of Gangsta to let us get to know our three main protagonists at first so that they can establish a kinship against various mob groups. All of that was nicely handled; until it introduced even more characters. You can say that Gangsta has the big issue of having a story that is the equivalent of a 24 episode anime length, and squeezing it into 12 episodes. It is evident by the halfway point since we\u2019re introduced to too many plot points that are not expanded upon very well and make the process of figuring it all out frustrating. Characters that are a part of the Twilights, except for Nicolas, are incredibly forgettable and bland from how little of an impression they make besides the intense action sequences they take part in.\\n\\n\r\nThe parts where the plot does work are the flashback sequences of Nicolas and Worwick. They give a nicely made, depressing picture of our two tortured henchmen that adds a nice layer of depth to make us feel sympathetic to the paths that they, unfortunately, had to take to survive. There is not any similar treatment for our main female protagonist, Alex. Nevertheless, a torturous backstory for her was not needed since we get a nicely directed psychological distress from her that let us understand the trauma she was/is going through from her past life as a prostitute. Her growth from being in that abusive world to being on stage singing a tearful song to people was impressive to see. Still, with all the positives for the development of our three main characters, that\u2019s all the plot has going for it. What is left is a bunch of half-baked supporting characters and a plot that does not know where its focus is once it reaches the halfway point. Eventually, it leads up to an ending that feels like a cheap cliffhanger that makes us wait for a sequel to happen.\\n\\n\r\nBesides their development, the main cast is in-of-themselves relatively charming and great to see. Nicolas being deaf offers an interesting character arc that adds to the unique nature of Gangsta. His banter with Worwick using his sign language feels natural and humorous in many scenarios that are involved with it. Not only with Worwick, but also Alex who tries her best to form a connection with him despite not knowing sign language. My only major concern was how little they expanded upon Alex trying to learn sign language to deepen her relationship with Nicolas, but that could be for the sequel\u2019s job to make that a reality. Besides his chemistry, Nicolas comes across as mysterious but likable in how he treats the people who are close to him.\\n\\n\r\nWorwick\u2019s troubled life as a gigolo, a male prostitute, is interesting in one episode where they go to a brothel that makes him a vulnerable person than what most people perceive him to be. Despite this, he often comes across as strong-minded and fair in how he deals with various situations that arise. With his sarcastic tongue and the deafness of our other male hero, they form a fascinating duo that can be described as opposites working together as friends from their childhood upbringings. Nevertheless, out of the three lead roles, my favorite would have to Alex. Not just from her beautiful looks, but how she tries to deal with her trauma after being saved from that tormented life had me hooked to her from beginning to end. Her fascinating growth from the bottom to the top was both engaging and tragically moving to see.\\n\\n\r\nGangsta\u2019s character designs bear a resemblance to Michiko no Hatchin since they are both animated by the same studio, Manglobe. In keeping its tradition of stellar character designs, Gangsta is another winner in how distinct the characters look from most anime. The skin tone and facial features give all the characters their unique look. Animation, while cutting corners here and there, is serviceable to the action sequences and momentary talking scenes. What is breathtaking is the art design of the world itself. It adds to the raucous atmosphere it perpetuates from the bright red blood to the dark, dank alleyways scattered throughout the city.\\n\\n\r\nGangsta was only a partial disappointment for me. Of course, most of the problems I have could be amended with a sequel, or, god help me, \u201dread the manga if it does not sell enough BDs.\u201d As it stands on its own, this season did not deliver on its story halfway through as much as its technical and main characters had to offer. Despite my grievances with it, the effects of my positives outweigh my perception of Gangsta. I grew attached to the main characters in more ways than one that saved Gangsta for me. When you still want a sequel to an anime to see more of the characters despite not liking the plot, that at least can be something to admire for it.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: B",

The show starts off a bit muddled, the setting is somewhat confused as it seems to be some version of Italy, yet people speak with poor New York accents and I sort of wish they had just gone with one of the two instead of a hodgepodge of both so they could throw in all the mobster stereotypes they could. The two main leadsstart out, in all honesty, as frankly detestable, though as you learn of their origins and the mythos of the world, their plight does become more understandable and they start to grow on you.\\n\\n\r\nThe action is fun, as is the gritty, X-Men-esque genetically enhanced super human discrimination premise. The bond between the two leads and the woman they try to protect from falling into their world of violence and crime is endearing and has a genuine sense of care and comradery, but the villains do come off as more than a bit cartoonish, even if it does make them all the more hateable for it. Overall, I was heavily hooked by the end, but the end came so abruptly and without a sequel, so much remains unanswered. I think it would have fared much better as a 24 or so episode series instead of 12 episodes with a next part that may never come. In the end, I enjoyed the time spent with the tortured team of badass anti-heroes, but the reasons above keep GANGSTA. at a slightly above average 7 out of 10 for me.",

It didn't complete the story and literally leaves you hanging on a thread with a plot you feel deserves another 5 episodes to fully complete. To get what I was missing I went to the manga. Sure it continues the plot to an extent, THEN IT STOPS. I feel Gangsta could be much more but then it leaves you hanging. Almost like hunter x hunter with the incomplete plot. It's a great anime to watch.\r\nNow I have been praising the anime a lot, but there's more to it. The background story behind characters isn't sogood. There will be some character that has been in the anime that you will barely notice because of how little attention they give to them and then BOOM all of a sudden the character is very relevant to the plot. And I don''t mean relevant in a they affect the main character for a while then fade away just to add spice to the story. I mean plot-altering relevant.\\n\\n\r\nIf you can get past the little character background( this is most likely because of the small amount of episodes) and just watch the anime with a simple mind you might enjoy it.",

The delving into \"gangsta\" activity, mob behavior, pimping, and other sorts of crime felt new, and not simply there just for coolness factor, but actually a pretty decent attempt at World building I quite enjoyed. Throughout the anime, the art and direction was solid, not ground breaking, but consistently of good quality, and the music did it's purpose I suppose. I did enjoy the opening but don't remember much else.\r\nAs far as character goes, I really did like the main cast. There wasn't an insanely high emotional connection, but Idid legitimately care to learn of their pasts and futures. I felt that the presence of a character who is def and use of sign language was also well done, with clear attention to detail and voice acting. The characters were cool, and a pleasure to watch as well. \\n\\n\r\nNow for the criticisms after all that I just said. I give the story a 5 and the overall anime a 6 for the exact same reason. THERE IS NO ENDING. I mean that the story simply stops in the middle of it all. There is no actual attempt at a conclusion, it's more like all of a sudden the next 40 episodes got lost. The way character backstories and narratives were handled was interesting, and well done, IF the story would have continued. But given it's abrupt \"ending\" they are simply left feeling underdeveloped and sporadically done. If there was a legitimate continuation I could see myself giving this anime a solid 8 to weak 9, but this anime screamed read the manga by the end, so if the story still interests you, I would suggest doing just that, though I have yet to do so, I do intend to.",

            "content": "If I can describe Gangsta in one word it would be... disappointingpieceofshit.\r\nA title that's so half-baked that it's truly deserving of a tailor-made portmanteau.\r\nAnd if you're one of the fortunate individuals who hasn't watched Gangsta yet then HALT, do not pass go, do not collect $200, stay away! As for the rest of the poor souls that suffered through the pilgrimage viewing that is Gangsta, on with the review. \r\nGangsta, a title name that immediately invokes imagery of money, sex, power and violence, and as luck would have it, a very appropriate namesake as well, as we're given just that in spades. This is astory that takes us to the deepest depths of society's bustling underbelly. Where law and order is traded in for carnage and mayhem. Where a wrong step can easily become your last. And where maturity is handled with as much subtlety as a Grand Theft Auto game. When it comes to try-hard entertainment, Gangsta has catapulted itself into another league but for all the wrong reasons. With content that can only be described as a pubescent teen's wet dream, it somehow managed something that's nigh impossible; taking a gratuitous amount of \"adult\" subject matter and making it all tepid in nature. A show stuffed from head to toe with lurid material yet invokes nothing, failing at even becoming lowbrow sleaze. For everything that Gangsta could have done it ended up doing nothing at all. Narratively, it also introduces a myriad of questions one after another but never once provides an answer for any of it, making this a double-edged sword of bad meets worse. With nothing to excite or stimulate you, this anime has mastered the art of blue balling. \\n\\n\r\nThe story follows the lives of three characters: handymen for hire, Worick and Nicolas, and former thottie, Alex, as they navigate their way through everyday life in the godforsaken hellhole of a city named Ergastulum that they call home, while also fighting off their own personal demons along the way. Because of Worick and Nicolas's line of work, they often find themselves caught in the cross-hairs of the city's perpetual battles to maintain power and balance. These inner-city civil wars are overseen by crime syndicates with the main source of conflict often tying back to a subgroup of humans named Twilights: people with genetically enhanced strength that could perform physical feats that far exceeds average humans while under the aid of certain drugs. They're basically pill poppin x-men. And as one would expect, due to these innate abilities, the Twilights are constant victims of societal discrimination while also serving as living weapons, which is an escalating issue just waiting to keel over. \\n\\n\r\nWith such a unique decrepit city serving as its setting and a premise that promises heavy-hitting content, you would think the creators would just run with it. But instead, what we get is a story that meanders around without any sort of uniformity behind its actions, effectively ending before it gets a chance to begin. It's like watching someone with ADD trying to multitask. Characters are constantly introduced only to be left hanging in the open with no explanation as to their overall involvement. Major events that develop in the backdrop would simply never exfoliate. Plot points are brought up to only come to a dead end with no resolution. And all of it leads towards an ending that can only be described as the biggest cock-tease of 2015. With its inability to finish anything, this anime is the spiritual embodiment of Finbarr Calamitous from Jimmy Neutron. It's incredibly half-assed. \\n\\n\r\nAnd as if to add insult to injury, despite all the over-the-top fights and constant debauchery going on in the city, the show itself remains painfully dull and uneventful. There are long stretches of time where absolutely nothing of relevance would happen. There may be a plot point itself that's \"grand\" in scope, but the build-up for it is often nonexistent, making it the equivalency of watching paint dry, even if the \"paint\" looks exciting on paper. Sometimes, when nothing of importance is going on, we're given an introspective look into the lives of our main characters. These are some of Gangsta's better moments as they help to get the audience familiarized to the psyche of the leads, as well as showcasing how they may have landed in their current positions in life. And while these moments may help elevated our ragtag group beyond cardboard cutout status, it doesn't stop the narrative from operating on AOL dial-up speed. The pacing is simply sluggish, even when what's being displayed would have you think otherwise. Story advancement is treated like an afterthought, which doesn't bode well for those that have a genuine interest in where the show would go next. \\n\\n\r\nThankfully, Gangsta doesn't spread itself too thin when it came to the characters, as most of the content centered around our three main leads. Worick is the level-headed member of the group and also the one in charge of keeping things in order. His quick wit and chill demeanor made him instantly likable. We're given a lot in the way of his complicated backstory that he shares with Nicolas; a backstory that helps thread the duo's connection to each other. Alex, the former thottie, is an emotionally damaged person that spends a majority of the show opening up to her new lifestyle with her two new companions. Despite her previous profession and general skimpy appearance, she's a rather reserved individual that we only learn more about gradually as the show goes on. But possibly the most memorable of the three that chews up all the scenery he's in is Nicolas himself.\\n\\n\r\nWhile not crucial to the overall material, one unique inclusion that Gangsta deserves credit for is giving us a main character that's Deaf. As of the time of this writing, there has never been a Deaf lead in an animated TV series before. For the most part, Deaf characters are usually reduced to taking up insignificant roles, like the brief uncredited scene in Mobile Police Patlabor: WXIII, or even worse, they're used in a way that screams tokenism, placed in the story to rack up sympathy points instead of being treated as just another person. This is the first time an anime has placed a Deaf character center-stage and treated them as a person, never once resorting to excessive victimizing. This can help open up dialogue for a better understanding of Deaf culture for those that were previously oblivious to it, making it a progressive move on Gangsta's part. \\n\r\nHaving taken ASL (American Sign Language) for two years myself during high school, there are mannerisms and behavioral patterns that are commonly recognized among any Deaf community, regardless of if it's abroad or not. And I can say that Manglobe did a commendable job in portraying that (for the most part). Of course, there are limitations to what they could accomplish, due to the fact that it's an animated feature and not live-action. But with all things considered, the translation came out better than I would have expected.\\n\\n\r\nAnd while Manglobe deserves respect on that front, it doesn't mean everything was smooth sailing for the presentation as a whole. If anyone has familiarized themselves with the studio's catalog, their creative output has always been plagued with inconsistencies. With many instances of distorted character models and janky choreography, Gangsta was far from anything you would call prim and proper. Where the show did shine was with its overall tone and atmosphere, the likes of which swept over every aspect of the audiovisual output, creating a sense of uniformity that melded the characters and narrative together. This wasn't much of a surprise given that director Shuk\u014d Murase was responsible for bringing it to life. His trademarked style, blending neo-gothic aesthetics and vogue-like character models to create a kind of occult aura\u2014as prominently showcased with Ergo Proxy and Witch Hunter Robin\u2014bled its way into Gangsta, if only to a lesser degree to adjust to the show's more \"urban\" outfitting. Murase brought his A-game once again, gifting Gangsta with a tone befitting its content. A directorial facelift that it desperately needed. While that didn't make the false sense of maturity that the show was hiding behind any better, it certainly made it more palatable as a viewing experience. \\n\\n\r\nTo help heighten the atmosphere even further, the music was brought to life by Tsutchie, who's famous for his work on Manglobe's fan-favorite, Samurai Champloo. Instead of drawing back to the Hip-Hop/Trip-Hop genre fusion of his work on Champloo, Tsutchie embarks down a sonic path that's more EDM inspired. Being nowhere as heavy-handed as Parasyte's take on the genre, Tsutchie took a far more stripped-down approach. Those that are fans of the more house/drum 'n' base aspects of EDM would find something to enjoy with Gangsta's musical choice. The opening theme \"Renegade\" by STEREO DIVE FOUNDATION was a nice J-pop/EDM track that kicked things into high gear for each new episode. Despite its niche sound, it's an opening that has easily received broad appeal due to its melody, glitch-pop flavoring, and midway breakdown. The ending, while also nice, was a more morbid song that wrapped up the episode nicely but didn't really serve as something you didn't want to skip after a few listens. \\n\r\nAll in all, the music was a fine fit and worked a lot better than expected for a show that tried to have a more dreary depiction. But for the brief glimpses of actual merit that Gangsta may have had, it's immediately snuffed out when you begin to factor in the issues it was plagued with. No little amount of good it had could outweigh the ton of bad that saddled it down.  \\n\\n\r\nThere's really no way around it; Gangsta was a flop. With each new episode, the show found itself struggling to stay afloat. What started out with audiences crossing their fingers for that eventual \"Aha\" moment to kick in, quickly fizzled away into disinterest as it slowly trudged towards the chopping block of its final episode. And with no solid conclusion in sight, Gangsta took what little potential it was holding onto and proceeded to run it into the ground, as it faded to black and people began moving on to the next best thing, erasing the thought of its existence from their memory. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10 \\n\\n\r\nI have a rather complicated relationship with studio Manglobe. On the one hand, they've created some of my most beloved shows (Ergo Proxy, Samurai Champloo and House of Five Leaves) but on the other, they're responsible for some of my most detested ones as well (Deadman Wonderland and Karneval). But instead of falling into either category, Gangsta lands somewhere in the middle ground for me, with the studio's other works like Samurai Flamenco, The World God Only Knows and The Sacred Blacksmith. Shows I don't quite like but don't hate either. They're simply titles that fell short of the mark for me. It's really aggravating seeing what Gangsta ultimately became, given all the untapped potential it was working with. But the overall lack of purpose in its plotting and the abrupt ending has assured that it'll be more loathed than remembered with fond memories. But perhaps the most disheartening thing about this show is that it serves as Manglobe's swan song since the studio went bankrupt and disbanded right after finishing this show. They were my personal favorite studio, so it's sad seeing them go out on such a sour note. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nGangsta is yet another title from the 2015 summer season that had potential but quickly dissolved away into nothingness. With plot points that went nowhere and characters that were never given reason to exist whatsoever, Gangsta squandered its run-time with too many issues to get a pass. And when taking into consideration what could only be the biggest cock-tease ending in years, there's no solid defense that could protect Gangsta from getting the ax.",

            "content": "Gangsta is the type of show that sounds catchy as it gets. As the name implies, there are gangsters which means there\u2019s crime. However, there are people who takes care of business these problems in the city of Ergastulum. Enter Nick and Worick, a pair of badass bishounen who takes cares of crime like another day in the park. As ordinary as the show sounds, it gets more complicated once they are assigned to a task that goes beyond their expectations. But for the audience, what should your expectations be for the show?\r\nBased on the manga written by Kosuke, Gangsta is essentially a series ofcrime fighting and classified as a more mature seinen. The urban city setting invites a lot of attention when it comes to violence such as prostitution, drug dealing, and other illegal activities. Luckily, we do have Nick and Worick to take care of the troubles. To make their task easier, we learn that Nick is a \u201cTwilight\u201d, the type of person who has heightened abilities enhanced by a special drug. While Worick doesn\u2019t possesses heightened senses, he does make it up for his smooth way of talking and photographic memory. The two aren\u2019t really alike as partners to kill crime. However at the end of the day, it\u2019s hard not to feel attached to them with their roles in the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing of the story is not hard to get comfortable with. The first few episodes quickly establishes the vulnerability of Ergastulum. Sometimes, it feels like a Gotham city where crime runs loose with Nick and Worick playing the roles of Batman and Robin. The mature style of the show can be quickly realized when they undertake an operation on screen in the first episode. The show isn\u2019t shy about making the violence happen on screen because it needs to create a bit of realism. At the same time, Nick and Worick recuses a young woman named Alex, who plays many important roles in the story. As a show like Gangsta, we learn much more about the characters. And that\u2019s a strong emphasis that needs to be realized because we want to learn more about the characters. They come from such different backgrounds and their lives are often at risk in such a dangerous environment. In Ergastulum, there are essentially no rules. It\u2019s about making a living and surviving each day. \\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to characterization, I can safely say that Gangsta knows its characters quite well. We get background storytelling especially for Nick and Worick. In fact, we learn much about their past including the people Nick associated with and how he got involved as a member of Twilight. On the other hand, there\u2019s also Worick who became his partner. The series reveals his true name and how he used to be neglected by his parents. A good amount of focus is the chemistry between the duo. It also takes elaborate time to detail how Twilight members are made and what their rules are. In the present, we can see how their past affected their relationship. As characters themselves, Nick is also unique as he suffers from a disability; he is deaf. At first, this may seem like a big problem as partners needs to coordinate well vocally. However, it\u2019s quickly established that he and Worick can work well with sign language and seemingly instinct to trust one another. And that\u2019s important development for the two. With such dangerous assignments each day, trust is a vital part between partners and the series does a good job to show their trustworthiness. On a comedic note, we also see what Worick does on his time off.  The smooth antihero has a way to give ladies pleasure and his keen sense of photography plays important roles in breaking cases. Nick is more like a warrior \u2013 armed with a sword, ruthlessness, and self-sense. This is an antithesis compared to Alex, a frail girl who suffers from PTSD-like symptoms. As the story progresses on, we learn more about her as well that reveals the darker side of Gangsta.\\n\\n\r\nDespite having some comedy here and there, the majority of the show has a mature feeling. Most of the characters are adults and in their mid-30s. The gangsters in the show are also prone to violence and some show how reckless they can be to accomplish their goals. Guns, swords, and bombs are no strangers to the series along with the fast paced action. With a setting that has a Mediterranean-like feeling, the show also seems like a social satire at time with its cultural themes. In particular, Nick and Worick are dressed with style while other characters such as Alex are portrayed with vulnerability.  While it gets top and gory at times, the show is also something I\u2019d describe as a smart flick. The themes of prostitution, child soldiers, and experimentations are an anti-establishment of what we try to make society as of today. Because in Gangsta, there\u2019s all types of trouble running loose with gangs and the mafia. The underworld is nothing short of what we try to eliminate from today\u2019s society. And in this show, that\u2019s clearly an understatement.\\n\\n\r\nIn essence, artwork is crude for the show. By crude, I don\u2019t mean it as sloppy but rather by the way society is depicted for its story. For its setting, the show does a clever job to make it seem like Ergastulum is a separate space from the outside world. The urban style combined with its classic atmospheric setting is very fitting for a show such as this. The characters are dressed neatly with the expensive suits and jewelry. However, it\u2019s the way the violence that\u2019s handled that gets cruel. Make no mistake. Gangsta is uncensored glory and enters a territory where cops cannot handle jobs on their own. That\u2019s why we got people like Nick and Worick. Speaking of which, the duo can seem like an eye candy for the ladies. In particular, Worick has that womanizing like charm with the way he looks. And as stereotypical as it can be, the guys in the show are designed like bishounen with hardcore abs and well-built figures. The show also has fan service with sex, in particular involving Worick. That\u2019s right. He\u2019s a ladies man and the show doesn\u2019t make us forget that.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s really hard to ignore the soundtrack. There\u2019s no easy way to describe it but there\u2019s a combination of upbeat, chilling, and jazz. It almost gives off a feeling of relaxation even during the most intense of scenes. Of course, action itself is also well coordinated with the OST. I\u2019d also have to say that both the OP and ED theme song are very attractive. It has a stylistic way of portraying the themes of the show with a montage of the main characters. And speaking of the characters, a strong plus for the show is their character voice mannerisms. In particular, Nick is the one to take notice of because of his lack of hearing. When he does speak, his voice seems like it\u2019s disconnected especially with the broken sentences. That\u2019s what really makes him different from the other characters though as it also establishes a link between him and his past. But really, when it comes down to it, Gangsta\u2019s music is bold and can be relentlessly appealing to the ears.\\n\\n\r\nSo what\u2019s to say about Gangsta in the end? It\u2019s a pretty much a badass show ran with its premise and knows what its intentions are. The cast of characters has an enthralling presence and throughout the story, we learn a great deal about the main protagonists. Sure, the show can seem a bit cruel at times but it\u2019s important to realize its purpose. Gangsta is not a show with colorful rainbows and where happy endings happen. In fact, I would say that the ending of the show is a bit controversial in itself. Regardless though, it\u2019s still a show that I\u2019d recommend anyone to give it a try especially for fans interested in a mature action flick.",

            "content": "Despite a few extraordinary contributions, the pulp crime genre is one that anime does not do particularly well.  I felt compelled to write this review of Gangsta because of the many unwarranted comparisons to Black Lagoon.  Gangsta is nothing like Black Lagoon, and it will be especially disappointing to watch with such an expectation.\r\nIf you want to watch pulp crime involving heists, car chases, and briefcases full of guns, cash and drugs, well that's not this anime.  Gangsta has no grounding in real world politics or criminal activity.  In fact, the mob families seem uninterested in any actual criminal activity, outsideof episode 1, and some mobsters, like Miss Christiano (the Tohsaka Rin of mafia bosses), seems so goodhearted as to be a downright pillar of the community.\\n\\n\r\nYou may be disappointed to find that Gangsta has no relationship to reality at all, set in a fictional city with a past that does not fit into our real-world history.  Many of the characters are superpowered humans called Twilights, and the story arcs are driven by the existence of Twilights and how humans interact with them - as opposed to something that is more grounded in real world situations and groups- like say, looting a Nazi submarine for fun and profit.\\n\\n\r\nGangsta is also not a fast-paced action-movie roller coaster, but rather has languid pacing.  This could make for a fine noir tone, but except for Nico, Worrick and Alex's flashbacks, Gangsta has neither good writing nor execution. \\n\\n\r\nThe entire series felt disjointed and fragmented, with the characters aimlessly shuffling through one poorly animated, forgettable vignette to the next.  Conflict built up from episodes 9 to 11 ends anticlimactically, with an final episode that fails to resolve the remaining plot threads.  \\n\r\nIt was very difficult to maintain any interest week by week, let alone care about minor characters that suddenly begin to \"matter.\"\\n\\n\r\nGangsta has no soundtrack to speak of, which only makes the show an even more low-key affair and frankly, the OP is better than some episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork begins on the cheap side of average, with uninteresting backgrounds, and suffers increasingly egregious off-model shots in both fight scenes and dialogue (such as episodes 8 and 9).  Poor art can be forgiven if other elements fall into place, but that is not the case here.\\n\\n\r\nGangsta has some clever moments, mostly Alex's character development, Nico's unique character and his past with Worrick. But the rest of the storylines unfold clumsily with no sense of urgency, drama or resolution.\\n\\n\r\nA comparison between Gangsta's 12 episodes and Black Lagoon's first cour reveals the difference in quality. The last episodes of Black Lagoon's first cour tie into and build upon themes of belonging that are raised beginning with episode 3, and ends on a self-contained high note with arc resolution and character development for its female and male leads.  All things considered, maybe it's lucky Manglobe's storyboarding team have just managed to stumble the show as far along as they have, unlike Bones and their handling of Blood Blockade Battlefront earlier this year.\\n\\n\r\nGangsta is probably better compared and contrasted with Darker than Black.  Both Darker than Black and Gangsta feature superpowered humans that work in the criminal underworld as a result of their superpowers.  Darker than Black offers noirish story arcs rather than action movie pacing.  Ultimately, both Gangsta and Darker than Black are about pleas for acceptance of the different and marginalized (Darker than Black's \"Contractors\").  \\n\\n\r\nHowever, Darker than Black features clever writing and compact, film noir storylines while Gangsta does not.  Darker than Black grounds its science fiction elements in real world politics, locations, and organizations, enough that character motivations and situations make sense despite the vague handwaving of how people acquired their powers.  It's a much better execution of a similar sci-fi/crime hybrid concept.   \\n",

            "content": "In the Ergastulum justice system, breaking any of the three laws is considered especially heinous. In Ergastulum, the dedicated individuals who investigate these vicious felonies are members of the laid-back duo known as the Benriya. These are their stories.\r\nIn the city of Ergastulum, violence, narcotics, and sex run rampant. For a series named Gangsta, it comes as an expectation of sorts. For anime, as a medium, an excess of violence, drugs, and real world sexual themes (doping prostitutes and pimping, which is far different than ecchi) are rarely put in place as a combination to form the core of a series. Gangsta utilizes this factand diligently puts it to use, allowing it to lure in those who are curious. In more ways than one, Gangsta comes off as a flashier mobster film equivalent from Western media.\\n\\n\r\nThe narrative of Gangsta follows the life of three main characters: Worick, Nicolas, and Alex. As Benriya (the Handymen), Worick and Nicolas are depicted as hired muscle doing odd jobs around the city, mainly for the big organized crime families \u2014 of which they are very acquainted with \u2014 and the police. The duo supposedly walk the line of neutrality, but it is seemingly a farce, given how deep they are affiliated with the powerful figures that run the city. The overall story of the series revolves around Twilights, people with enhanced, drug-induced capabilities which exceeds that of a normal person's by varying amounts. Their strength, or combat capabilities rather, are ranked from D to S, the latter being the highest. Like the case with all differences, being a Twilight brings upon discrimination. This acts as the main strife in the series, as increasing tensions build up around the city. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the environment of Ergastulum is eventful and entertaining, the direction that Gangsta moves towards often strays from a decisive path. This is one of the biggest issues that Gangsta has: the sub-plots are shallow and detract from the story as a whole. As one goes progresses through the series, countless characters come and go. New characters seem to pop up every couple of episodes, but you can never be sure if they're actually going to be anyone that's relevant; usually they aren't. Because of the amount of characters and their individual problems, there's simply too much information and too little time to present it. The series only just begins to get into the big conflict during the last third of the show but, even then, it ends abruptly at a cliffhanger.\\n\\n\r\nAnother aspect of the series that seemed very dull and recycled, to me at least, was the rankings of tags that the Twilights possess. To put it in honest terms, it's really just power-levels renamed. I'm personally not a big fan of power-levels being ranked; it takes a lot away from the potential of fights in a series since you already know who's stronger and projected to win. With that being said, the violence in Gangsta is probably still a great selling point for many. The fights aren't bad, but they leave something to be desired.\\n\\n\r\nAs previously mentioned, the amount of characters that Gangsta introduces in such a short amount of time is seriously astounding. We get enough backstory about Worick and Nicolas, obviously because they are the main duo, but there's not much regarding any of the supporting cast affiliated with the big families, the hunters, or the guild. Ginger? Gina Paulklee? Literally who? As one of the main characters, I was expecting a bit more out of Alex. Besides recovering from her destructive lifestyle as a prostitute, she doesn't do much else other than house sitting the Benriya bachelor pad. I understand the purpose behind Alex's character, but she feels a bit out of place and useless as a main character. Her struggles with coming clean adds a light element of a feel-good story, but she could have easily been just a supporting character and not much would have changed. From how the series portrays her, she appears to only serve as a staple that showcases how Worick and Nicolas are good guys. Oh, and fan service.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of visual quality, I thought that Manglobe did pretty well. Visually, the show appears to be a good adaptation of the manga. In terms of audio, Renegade, by the Stereo Dive Foundation, is memorable. The overall OST is also pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nWhether or not Gangsta can actually be considered good is up for debate and what you come to expect when defining something as actually good. In comparison to the rest of the Summer '15 season, it was certainly one of the better shows that aired, but that's simply because the season as a whole was quite barren. Ultimately, Gangsta had a lot of interesting ideas, and even potentially interesting characters, but none of that matters if it is not utilized.",

            "content": "\"As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a Gangster.\" - Henry Hill (Goodfellas) \r\nWhen Gangsta first rolled up onto the scene in its '64 Impala, I thought to myself- wow, this show is going to be great. It wowed us with some cool characters who weren't schoolkids, a gritty underworld type setting, and some ultraviolence not seen in a long time. Surely, this show had the makings of being the new Black Lagoon- an anime held in high esteem by many viewers for its portrayal of a true crime drama and high action blockbuster feel. \r\nWell, let's find out. \r\nArtworkand Animation: 6\\n\\n\r\nGangsta is Manglobe's long awaited return to prominence after a run of relative quietness, and they're back with a bang. At times, Gangsta looks absolutely fantastic, with some awesome cityscape drops and dirty, grungy looking streets full of seedy activity. The city of Ergastulum really feels like a haven for criminal activity- and the subdued color mood of the show, lots of greys and browns lend to this atmosphere. The character designs are quite nice as well, no ridiculous spider people like in Code Geass, nor any stupidly disproportionate females. In other words, they manage to make people look like people without breaking the laws of physics. \\n\\n\r\nThe other side of the coin is that at times it feels really low budget. Certain areas are reused fairly often, and the character detail level is inconsistent throughout, but overall good. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound and Voice Acting: 9\\n\\n\r\nEnter the first anime character I've ever seen with a disability that affects their communication with others. I have to hand it to Kenjirou Tsuda and Brandon Potter for the portrayal of the deaf Nicolas Brown. Ian Sinclair's performance is also top notch with the suave, smooth talking Worick. The rest of the characters are voiced appropriately- crooked cops, menacing sounding thugs, gangsters, and other criminals. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\\n\r\nGangsta definitely puts two interesting characters in the driver's seat- Nick and Worick. Nick, as mentioned above- is deaf. He communicates mostly with his fists, but also sign language in some more tender moments. We're shown that he actually can speak, but he's been deaf for so long that it's affected his speech, leading to this very slurred manner of speaking. Nick's fighting skills are nearly unparalleled in the city of Ergastulum, and as a member of a group known as \"(dog)tags\" or \"twilights\", he's a very respected fighter among them. \\n\\n\r\nWorick, on the other hand, is much more of the cool man, and much more thoughtful and less impulsive than Nick, making them excellent partners. Worick handles the business deals of their illicit activities and keeps up appearances with mafia bosses and persons of influence- all while making a few bucks on the side with some bedside business. He also keeps Nick in check when tensions run high, and others get higher. \\n\\n\r\nOne issue that I do have with Gangsta regarding characters though is the introduction of lots of new characters right before the ending of the show. Over the course of 12 episodes, it had picked up a lot as it were, with multiple crime families, factions, and other random people, but the ending is just silly with new characters that I don't have time to care about, let alone know their names. \\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5\\n\\n\r\nGangsta started off as a gritty tale of a pair of criminals who would do dirty jobs that even the crooked cops wouldn't touch. Doing jobs for friends, mafia bosses for that almighty petty cash, anything goes in the underworld. Murder, sex, drugs, alcohol, prostitution, It's all there. We really get a feel for how seedy this city is- glorifying violence and just how much money really talks. Where it started strong, giving us a very detailed background on the city and how each other players in it came to be, once again, approaching the end it all started coming unraveled. Take Black Lagoon, for example. It manages to introduce multiple mafia factions and bosses, interesting/nasty arc-based villains, a lot of side characters, and kept them relevant to the plot throughout the entire show. Everything was tied back to these characters who managed to survive.\\n\\n\r\nIn Gangsta, there are a ton of loose ends left just because they tried to shove so many different characters in to make the story stretch out just a little further. When a show gets so convoluted that I lose track of who was with what group and what was happening- then you have a problem. I take shows like Serial Experiments Lain and Ergo Proxy as examples here: they're intentionally made to be complex and intricate. \\n\r\nGangsta gets needlessly complicated at the end, for no real reason. As the great Mr Plinkett once said: \"You're not making \"The Usual Suspects\" here, so keep it nice and simple!\" With a lot of good violence and characterization with characters we already had, there was no need to cram 10 more in there behind them for some semblance of depth. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEven after the ending, I still don't remember which of the myriad of characters were associated with what faction and trying to defend this or that, or who were important twilights, or what their ranks were or if any of that even mattered! \\n\\n\r\nI don't see why it couldn't have just stayed a core group of individuals involved in an arc based, or even one single cohesive conflict. Instead, we get an anime that has no story direction. I don't know what the conflict in Gangsta really was, because violence against Twilights was always there. It didn't just start in the course of the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe final strike against the story, though is that nothing is resolved at the end. It loses a lot of focus around episode 10, and ends in a very unraveled set of threads. I don't know if it's a setup for a second season that's not been greenlit, but it's got a total non ending. Not even an open ending, just a non.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\\n\r\nAs I said above, Gangsta started out very strongly, and I was really into it. I liked the action, how it didn't pull any punches with ultraviolence, and that it was gritty and unapologetic. I still like that about the show. However, what was a bit offputting to me was the inclusion of superpowers. In a gang based crime drama set on the mean streets of anywhere USA (or Japan, whatever) you generally (read never) have superpowers factor into the equation. The fact that characters in this show could take drugs and then turn into a super hero with Spiderman-like jumping, strength, and sensing abilities, and incredible, greater than human reflexes, it kind of killed suspense in several parts of the show. Then came the Tokyo Ghoul style one-upping of each character's power. \"Oh this guy's a rank SuperUltraMetaOverkill?\" \"Well, this chick is a HyperUberMonsterBoss class!\" and it just went on and on from there... totally ruining their hierarchy/scale of skill and abilities. \\n\\n\r\nThere's a lot to like about Gangsta though- it's a very serious show with no fanservice, no horrifiyingly bad dialogue, and a good basis for a tale, it's just a shame that it kind of wraps its 64' Impala around a telephone pole at the end. Oh well, like Eazy said- just say \"oh brotha. Throw it in the gutta, and go buy another.\"\\n\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr\\n\\n\r\n+ Good characters and a very cool setting\\n\r\n+ Good action and visual effects\\n\\n\r\n+/- Pacing is iffy, and side characters appear once and sometimes never again, leaving a lot of side stories unfinished\\n\\n\r\n- Non ending, show gets derailed and unfocused starting about episode 10\\n\\n\\n\r\nRecommend? \\n\\n\r\nYes, definitely a standout of the summer 2015 season, but not great enough to be a new Black Lagoon.\\n\\n\r\n\"Damn it feels good to be a gangsta\" - Geto Boys",

            "content": "Seventh Review - GANGSTA. \r\nWere do I begin talking about this, At first I was a bit bored but then it picked up, This is more of an adults anime rather than a younger audience anime and you have to pay attention to detail or you can easily get confused. \r\nI started liking this anime and it reminded me a lot like Black Lagoon in some ways as it was about gangs and guns, however as you carry on watching it it's actually very different. The plot is unique and strange, you have to understand it in order to like this anime, you have tobe able to get in the right mind or you won't like it. The plot is pretty simple, two handymen or 'assassin-like' people and a girl in the line of dirty work. The plot picks up at the end mainly where some 'strangers' come into the mix and everything goes mayhem. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters I personally liked, I found them very interesting to get to know, especially as it shows you their pasts bit by bit. I personally liked Alex as her past was hidden a lot until the end. I love the uniqueness that was given to each character. Some characters were shown as 'stronger' than others and this gave you the feeling of authority that was around the city. You could see who was the underlings and who was the boss, It was great that the anime didn't pay attention to just some characters but shown you a variety of them, and not all are gangsta bosses, they would be a simple 'cigarette seller' or 'doctor'. \\n\\n\r\nThe art was great for this sort of anime, it was in detail and you could keep up with the style. For the genre the anime is I thought that the art work was generally good and it kept me liking the anime more. \\n\\n\r\nHonestly, some people hate this anime but for me I loved it, it had enjoyment from it. I admit some areas you got bored or had to rewind to understand what was going on but if you managed to keep up then it was a good anime. I am looking forward to more of this, I held of for a week because I didn't want it to end and now i know there more to come I'm happy and excited. If you like action, gang-violence and a rough style then I would recommend you give this a try. \\n\\n\r\nCanaan~",

            "content": "basically only doing a review because of the lack of good reviews. This anime's only downside is that it ends without any real ending. Assuming there is more this is going to be an amazing series. I'm equating the bad reviews to them being done and found helpful by children who aren't yet capable enough of mind to understand what is going on in the show. That or they just can't handle mature themes. One of the \"most helpful\" reviews complained of the presence of prostitution and the even positive way that it is depicted. Yes this is a very progressive show and has manyviewpoints that might clash with the typical brainwashed sheep. They're probably voting for Trump. This show was incredibly deep and progressive in ways i've never seen in anime before. Prostitution was portrayed in a way that didn't shame the prostitutes. The leading character is a deaf man and spends the majority of the anime making you think he's the biggest strongest bad ass in town which may yet be true. It shows very realistic experiences of people living through traumatic events and perhaps the typical person can't relate to any true trauma. the way they show these victims such as the prostitutes being drugged and dependent on those abusing them despite the horror of it. One of the bad reviews complained of the ranking system of the tags like they have any sort of actual relevance. Once you've watched it through you see that these rankings represent very little and this is particularly true of the main cast of the show. This show has a depth of realities that i've never seen represented so well in what comes down to being simply a cartoon. To those submitting negative reviews, you'll understand when you're older.",

            "content": "An Ergastulum was a building in ancient Rome, they were designed as prisons to hold in chains dangerous slaves, or punish them. They were essentially subsurface pits built deeply into the ground\u2014large enough to allow the slaves to work within it and containing narrow spaces in which they slept. Must\u2019ve been one hell of a place to survive in. Based on Kohske\u2019s manga, Gangsta shows you a different Ergastulum, it\u2019s the name of an actual city, one devoid of law. The mafia runs the city with an iron fist, it\u2019s a dog eat dog world, a city where the living and death interact and sex,money, drugs and violence are the necessary evils to survive. Its survival of the fittest and while not exactly a prison, it might as well be with the philosophical governing to the likes of the movie, \u2018I-Robot\u2019. It\u2019s gritty, ugly, rough, graphic in detail and downright bleak and it's fascinating to watch all those who thrive within.\\n\\n\r\nGangsta tells the complex and grief-filled story of gangsters, or rather, the \u2018Handymen\u2019, two men-for-hire who take on various jobs from citizens and criminal organisations in the fictional city of Ergastulum, like body-guarding, money-collection and home repairs. The city takes a close representation of Italy during the mafia era, except it is governed in the background by the \u2018Four Fathers\u2019\u20143 mafia families and a mercenary guild. Thieves, drugs, prostitutes, shady doctors and corrupted cops are plot essentials and as the series unfolds, so does the mystery that surrounds the creation of Ergastulum. Our main protagonists, Worick Arcangelo and Nicolas Brown are neutral contractors who stay out of underworld politics so they can be called upon by anyone who can pay. While seemingly amoral, the pair saves a prostitute named Alex Benedetto from her abusive pimp and give her a place to stay, and as an outsider, Alex acts as the audience\u2019s fresh perspective into the Handymen\u2019s grim and terrifying day-to-day lives, where murder is graphically and unapologetically portrayed.\\n\\n\r\nAfter an unspecified war in the early 20th century, many soldiers came back to Ergastulum dependent on a weaponised drug called \u2018Celebrer\u2019 and their children were born with its debilitating effects. They were given the label \u2018Twilights\u2019, these offspring are capable of superhuman strength and are exploited by criminal gangs as slaves, who openly fight and kill each other in the back streets without fear of prosecution. Twilights are heavily discriminated against, so they are tagged by the government to keep track of them to keep them in line. Many \u2018Tags\u2019 opt to work for Ergastulum\u2019s mafia families regardless and as a result, the show features some bloody massacres by criminal Twilights who carry out hits against \u2018Normals\u2019 and often times have high-intensity battles against their own, sizing each other up based on the rank displayed on the tags they wear which are based on strength. Many are essentially slaves, unable to escape the city, its crime or its vices. However, the balance is upheld by the Four Fathers and the 3 laws are imposed on the Twilights\u2014Never take action against a Normal, obey your master and defend yourself if it does not conflict with the first two rules. With such a show which depicts superhuman abilities, the effects of evolution would eventually come into play. Those that use Celebrer have a shortened lifespan to compensate for their abilities.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Gangsta mostly focuses on the day-to-day lives and the pasts of our main protagonists, each episode gradually explores the underlying tension between the four criminal families of Ergastulum and the Twilights which eventually culminates in an all-out gang war with Nick and Worick caught in the middle of it. While Alex is first terrified of her saviours, we get to see the terrible ordeals both Handymen went through and how their work ultimately aims to rid the city of its worst so the few good souls they care about can live without fear. Thankfully, while mostly a serious show, there is a splash of humour and light-hearted moments every so often which makes the cast more endearing, although in saying that, these moments never betray the dark and gritty atmosphere. Gangsta\u2019s mystery surrounding its characters is built up slowly to give enough time for each character\u2019s pasts to be explored and explained. Worick is the face of the Handymen and the most visible protagonist; a smooth-talking one-eyed businessman with an easy-going nature that masks his darker tendencies, and his immunity to violence ends up a lot more understandable once the audience gets to learn his past as an abused illegitimate mafia child. \\n\\n\r\nAlex is a sweet young woman seemingly caught up in trafficking exploitation and trapped in Ergastulum who becomes a whole lot more saddening once her withdrawals are exposed. Nicolas is a silent and menacing Tag who also happens to be deaf and Celebrer-dependent, acting as the muscle but gradually revealed to be far more than just another soulless murderer. Nick is easily the highlight of the show and it is rare to see a character in anime with a disability (deaf), yet the writing and voice actors (both sub and dub) do a great job of treating it with respect while making it an integral part of his character, rather than a gimmick existing solely for spectacle. Much of the narrative in Gangsta is conveyed via out-of-order flashbacks which require your full attention to get the most out of it and understand the underworld politics engulfing their city. You\u2019ll be treated to some of the most satisfying fight scenes and faction face-offs in recent years, thanks to the violence-laden nature of Ergastulum and its sick past. Nicolas is featured in the majority of these combat scenes as a troubled Twilight himself, though thanks to his deafness and continued abuse of Celebrer to numb his pain, is relatively unique in his menace as most other Tags and Normals don\u2019t know what to do with him.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation in Gangsta which is done by Manglobe are spectacular! Character designs of our featured trio are very distinctive, they look like people who have gone through a lot of life\u2019s darkest paths. Also liked how they have different clothes for different episodes, it\u2019s always a welcomed concept. The colour palette is dark, drab and shadowy with muted hues of the sprawling Ergastulum, allowing the copious amounts of crimson blood and rare instances of colour shown to stand out fantastically in action sequences\u2014which are fast and furious with amazing choreography. Very fluid with the great use of camera angles and Matrix-like slo-mo bullet time effects. The moody soundtrack was done by Tsutchie (Samurai Champloo and Cowboy Bebop), whether it\u2019s a quiet conversation or tense stand-off, also fit the gritty tone of the show perfectly. A mixture of sorts with techno, drum \u2018n\u2019 bass and jazzy beats. Voice acting has solid performances all around. Opening and Ending are incredibly great with \"Renegade\" by STEREO DIVE FOUNDATION, is an epic upbeat dubstep track while, Yoru no Kuni by Annabel, is an emotional ballad about hope and looking towards the future. Both feel interconnected, and the lyrics fit very well to the storyline.\\n\\n\r\nGangsta is raw in all its depiction, realistically showing you the underbelly of the criminal world and a dysfunctional society. It handles most themes successfully by tackling these societal problems in a mature way, giving you a different perspective from the victim\u2019s point of view. We all understand that the actions shown throughout the series are looked down upon, but yet, when it confronts us upfront, emotions are left stirred and disrupted in an uncomfortable manner and it's relentlessly brutal in its attack on your moral compass. It\u2019s a great action seinen that evokes plenty of emotion. It\u2019s a character-driven story with an equally compelling plot that has high style and great substance moulded together, although it is held back from being one of the greats by an abrupt ending. During production, Manglobe filed for bankruptcy which sucks. Because of this unfortunate event, there isn\u2019t a true ending and we can only hope that one day we can see a continuation from a different studio. It deserves a much better legacy.\\n",

            "content": "DISCLAIMER: I did not read the manga. This review should be taken as an anime-only perspective. This WAS my most favorite anime last summer season until it showed its ugly head. What happened?!\r\nThe Highlights \r\nCharacter Development: Great for the first eight episodes\r\nThe Hunters: Unnecessary addition which stagnated the show overall\r\nPlot: Evenly paced but desperately needs a sequel\r\nEnding: The most inconclusive ending this season\r\nArtwork and Animation: Often passable but terrible at times \r\nGangsta. will always be a shining example of how terrible animation can destroy the mood of the show and why not to adapt a manga which is still on its world building phase.\r\nTo behonest, this has the most compelling premise and characters this season which was unfortunately given a very low budget for its own good. The staff has done a few tricks to cover that problem via zooming in and out some of the scenes and the use of still images but it shows its ugly head when the characters engage in action. Character expressions were awful and deformed during close ups and drawn poorly when distant. The fight scenes are dragging and the character movements are really stiff.\\n\\n\r\nA viewer whose priority is the visual appeal will be turned off by how sluggish the animation could be and will find himself dropping this show once he reaches episode 9 which is really unfortunate for Gangsta because of its masterful storytelling for the first eight episodes. Exposition in particular can be a double edged sword as it ruined Fate Stay Night's great moments but this anime showed that it can be used to further enrich the plot while also entertaining the audience. In Gangsta's case, we were not spoonfed by dull narration but the staff decided to show us tidbits of their past and what drove them to what they are right now. Episodes six and seven in particular were the best episodes this summer season which explained what Alex, Worrick and Nicholas were like in the past and man, these are two episodes which seamed heartwarming and cold scenes seamlessly. \\n\\n\r\nWhile not new in terms of plot, this was executed properly at least for the first eight episodes. The show excelled when it presents the character interaction between the leads and the intricacies of its story when taken to a larger picture. Moreover, Gangsta.'s ambitious when it comes to its world building since its premise was thoroughly explained, from Alex' reason to stay in town to the powers that be whose interaction was fragile enough to exude an uncomfortable feeling when we are watching this show. This however, faltered the show's quality because it has only an episode left to iron out multiple plot line and it failed to do so.\\n\\n\r\nThe character interaction is also excellent too. The Handymen plus Alex are quite a pleasure to watch. Their backgrounds were sufficiently provided and man, this is not your typical sad or bubbly flashback. Only a few anime series give detail to all other minor characters while not forgetting the main leads and Gangsta. is one of those. If we are to base Gangsta's merit for the first eight episodes, I have no reservation to say that it was the best anime last summer.\\n\\n\r\nNOW WHAT WENT WRONG WITH GANGSTA?\\n\\n\r\nGiven that the artwork is a mess in Gangsta. (see episode 9), the story should at least be complete and compelling. The balance between action and character drama was stable until the end of episode eight then its ugly head showed afterwards.\\n\\n\r\nThe inclusion of the Hunters and the sudden shift to focus on the larger events in Ergastulum marred this already flawed show. The intimate relationship it built with its viewers were destroyed the moment we were presented the Hunter's psychotic demeanor and shounen like powers. Their motives for killing Twilights were never explained and they did not add anything to the complexities of Ergastulum. With the abrupt focus in the city and the addition of these characters, Gangsta. was reduced to your generic dark anime. Character interaction between the leads is now sporadic from episodes nine onwards to give way to new characters which we barely know. How can a viewer possibly care for dozens of new characters in a span of three episodes?\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is mostly good in this show. However, there are moments when it is weirdly placed. Doug's death scene could be a compelling one due to all the direction the staff has given but was inserted with very upbeat tone which destroyed its poignancy. Another misstep is the sudden cut of the lovely piano piece at the end of episode 5 which is thankfully still an elegant episode by all means.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, this is not the biggest flaw of the anime adaptation of Gangsta. If we are going to base the quality of each episode, I still think it is a fine show. It seemed like the staff and the publisher forgot that the manga is still on its early phase but still decided to animate the show. The series ended right in the middle of the large war it created and it caught up with the manga. New characters are barely introduced, the main leads' resolve are nowhere to be seen and the Hunters continue to ruin the show with their shonen-esque attributes. There is no resolution and we were given a finale which is a good episode in its own but a letdown as a series ender.\\n\\n\r\nWill we be able to see the next season? No. It was a shame that this anime was adapted a season too early so we will never be able to see the end of the current arc. The staff could've done an anime original ending but they still stick to adapt this one faithfully until the end which really backfired. Ugh.",

            "content": "Gangsta, spelled that way because proper spelling wouldn't be extreme enough, is an ongoing manga created by Kohske that started in 2011. In 2015, Manglobe did an anime adaptation, finishing it slightly before the studio declared bankruptcy. This is their last work to be released right now. There's a film, Genocidal Organ, that was supposed to open shortly after this series ended but, given the situation, it's uncertain when it will open at this time. So, how is Gangsta as the Studio's last series, possibly ever?\r\nStory:\r\nNicolas and Worick are Handymen, which is the term used for mercenaries in this series. Because calling them mercs wouldn'tbe special enough. In the crime-filled city of Ergastulum, they take jobs that no one else will. We get to see the two of them work for the police, Mafia and back alley doctors. During a mission for the police, the two exterminate an upstart gang of thugs and take in a prostitute, Alex, as their assistant. Offering her a new life. But everything isn't kosher in Ergastulum. Someone's encroaching on the city and breaking its rules, which could result in problems for everybody.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest issue with the series is the ending. Like Code Geass, Gangster doesn't feature any kind of resolution. Rather, it ends on a bombastic note with everything seemingly going wrong and a lot of cliff hangers. The big difference between this and Code Geass is that Sunrise was stable when they released the first series of that and Manglobe... well, who even knows at this juncture if they'll be able to continue in the wake of their bankruptcy. Putting that aside, there's also an issue with the world building, mainly the overuse of exposition and flashbacks. The series expends a lot of time on discussing their people with superhuman abilities, how the city's rules work and a lot of it is done through clunky exposition or overly long flashbacks.\\n\\n\r\nOn the positive side, the series features a lot of interesting conflicts with some strong sources of tension. In spite of the somewhat sloppy execution, I will also credit the world building for having some good ideas that may very well have developed into something really good. I also appreciate that the missions get a lot of variation and the back story for how Nicolas and Worick partnered up has some really strong elements to it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThis series has a really strong cast of characters. Both the major and minor characters have a lot going for them, even with a lot of the minor characters having fairly minimal use. There are great interactions with these characters as well. Worick and Nicolas have a great dynamic. I also really like the scenes with Nicolas and Nina. They're actually really sweet.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork in this is quite good. The character designs are well done. The action sequences are strong and there are a lot of really good details. It's definitely up to Manglobe's usual standards.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThere are some really good performances in this. Tsuda Kenjirou does a really good job providing the voice for our deaf protagonist. It definitely has that quality that you get when an actual deaf person speaks where they can approximate the sounds but they aren't sure what the words actually sound like so it's a bit off. Suwabe Junichi, Noto Mamiko & Yuuki Aoi all give strong performances as well. There aren't any bad performances, but those four are the ones who really stood out. The music is more mediocre. It isn't bad but it's not good either. It's there and it's serviceable.\\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nThere's a scene where two of the minor female characters are shown in bed together in a way that illustrates quite strongly that they are, at the very least, having sex but it's late in the series and they aren't characters we spend a lot of time with, so the extent of their relationship beyond that is unclear. Alex also gets groped by another woman at one point, but the woman in question is shown as being in a relationship with a man and the scene is just kind of odd and out of place. So, it's probably safe to say it's not important.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nGangster is a pretty enjoyable series. It has some solid ideas, good tension, some really strong characters, solid art and strong voice acting. It is, however, weakened by an ending that resolves nothing, bland music and a general abuse of exposition & flashback scenes. Overall, I give it a 7/10. If the premise sounds interesting to you, give it a go. Next week I'm looking at Rurouni Kenshin: Meiji Kenkaku Romantan- Tsuiokuhen.",

            "content": "Don't pay any mind to any of the other clearly-misguided reviews on this particular anime that are ranking it so low.  The only thing, and I mean ONLY thing wrong with this anime is the length and where it abruptly ends.  It was quite clear the company ran out of money by the last couple of episodes.  This is potentially a story that could have gone on as long as Monster or Rurouni Kenshin and still stayed interesting, but it didn't.\r\nBoth of the main characters are older, neither of them having internal psychological wars with themselves as to whether or not theyshould do what they're going to do.  They both have a general sense of purpose that is completely lacking in so many typical Shounen animes of today.  The main characters are clearly friends, with deep backstories and a believable friendship that makes itself persistently obvious over the course of 12 episodes.  \\n\\n\r\nThe dub is great, one of the main characters is deaf but it is voiced so extremely well that I REALLY liked this difference in the overall cast setup.  For once the characters are actually older than me too, in their mid+ 30s.  Their friendship is organic and believable, the terms of their coming together is both rich and deep.  Very easy to sympathize and see why they became friends over the course of watching the first season.\\n\\n\r\nThe feminazis might have an issue with this show, as it starts out with the classic stereotypically fan-service stacked females, one of which is saved from a life of prostitution and rescued by these darker 'knights in shining armor'.  It develops quickly though.  Everyone's a jiggalo, not just the females, which I think serves to even the Feminist playing field.  The chick still gets stuck with the role of helpless secretary / nanny (she gets stuck with taking care of a baby in one episode).   \\n\\n\r\nThe story is your classic \"born a certain power-level, get stronger and push your power level higher by defeating stronger foes and/or overdosing on a drug\".  It's still quite good and fits with the overall atmosphere.  The backstory is great, from what I got of the first season, but incomplete.  A lot of unanswered questions / content for at least one extra future season.  Hopefully they'll bring it back.  I'll give it a 7.5 until then, although with another season this show could easily be another Cowboy Beebop.. with much less digression from the overall storyline.   \\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10 - I do recommend.  It's like samurai x meets DBZ meets something dark with medium-strong sexual undertones.",

Well, okay, let's give it a try. \\n\\n\r\nAnd there I was hoping not to write anything in English here. Well, now I'm sorta forced to do so. Anyway, let's get started. \\n\\n\r\nNot to offend anyone, but I don't understand people's complains about this anime \"being a total disaster\" or whatsoever. To me, it was pretty good. I would dare say awesome, actually. Donno what everyone expected to see, hear, but you can't deny the artwork, the sounds, the characters. I myself don't like protagonists in any way, considering I hate it when a smart (to be more precise, a genius) guy lets himself into a situation and the lifestyle of doormat & homeless stray - JUST DON'T GET IT. But hey, that's just me. I don't care why the characters act the way I would never, because that's none of my business. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot. The story. Didn't get it quite clear. That's why I should probably stick to the manga some time soon. \\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned before (or didn't I?), the visual part and the music. Oh holy dear neurons of head of mine. It was nighttime, nothing made a sound, earphones were on my head, and the brightening of laptop's LCD. My words look like something went wrong with me right now, and that might be true. Just a glimpse of recalling the night I watched this anime already makes me feel like a teenage underpuberty girl, who stands close to her idol Santa Clause or smth. Yeah, right, that's totally an exaggeration, but I'm telling you. The meal was good, I enjoyed it.",

            "content": "Story: 1\r\nGangsta had a phenomenal beginning but unfortunately, quickly fell into a tedium which then deteriorated into a poor plot with little explanation.\r\nUnfortunately, gangsta did not live up to its initial hype. While the first episode was amazing as it provided a well balance between action and exposition which established to the audience as to what to expect: ultra violence and shady dealings. However, several episodes later, it still could not establish a plot and it really just became a \u201cGangsta no nichijou\u201d or \u201cThe everyday lives of gangsta\u201d at that point. When it does finally introduce a plot of some degree it\u2019s so poorlyexecuted and explained that it may as well have been written by a primary schooler. Basically the plot becomes: a new organisation wants to overthrow the established powers. And the reason why this plot is poorly executed is that very little is explained to the audience and all we\u2019re given is just a bunch of fight scenes between Twilights. So basically at this point it\u2019s like watching two idiots slugging it at each other and waiting to see who falls down first.\\n\\n\r\nThe other problem is that, with whatever time it has left, it is spent explaining backstories of its characters. Not that there\u2019s anything wrong with backstories, but having no developing plot means that I may as well be reading LoL character pages. In fact, reading LoL character pages is probably more enjoyable than watching several episodes of backstories. And lastly, the show fails to give any actual conclusion and everything is just left open, so open that that the audience is unable to imagine a conclusion because there isn't enough information.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the lack of an actual, gripping story which it tries to fill in with violence was what made this show become as disappointing as it did.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThe character designs are alright, but the backgrounds really helped develop the mood and feel of the setting. The faded out, dull backgrounds helped establish a slum-like feel.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nThe OP is exceptional, both visually and musically, the ED is alright but not as good as the OP. The BGM is nothing memorable and is often just forgotten in lieu of focusing on the fighting scenes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9 \\n\r\nProbably the forte of gangsta. Gangsta has been able to develop their characters quite well through dialogue and interaction scenes. We even get a good sense of support characters due to their characters actually being explored, as well as how they relate to both the main characters and other supports. However, one thing I cannot get over is Alex\u2019s character. Her existence is utterly contrived and she adds very little to the story and even development of the main characters, even though she\u2019s literally next to them most of the time. She seems to be some kind of emotion device in that we\u2019re supposed to feel sorrow/empathy for her at certain scenes but it comes out so forced that they may as well have put a \u2018feel sad here\u2019 textbox in her stead.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4\\n\r\nIf I had to rate the first episode alone, I\u2019d have given it an 8. But as the series stretched on, it became clearer and clearer that it would be a mindlessly, nonsensically violent show that would rely more or less on its action scenes. The fights between twilight and gun users became stale after a few scenes as the gun users posed no threat. Twilights appear to move faster than bullets while the gun users seem to contain one of two traits: they either can\u2019t aim or they take several decades to pull the trigger which allows the Twilight to throw stuff at them or just run up and slash them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5\\n\r\nI was really hoping that this would be an anime that would redeem this season\u2019s collection of lacklustre titles. Unfortunately, the overreliance of blood and gore to excite viewers quickly wears off and the poorly contrived plot makes this show dismissable.\\n",

            "content": "Gangsta. is an anime that could have been godlike but instead it was 'fine'. A show to pass the time. \r\n-Story: 4\r\nThere are \"Twilights\" and \"normals\" -> Twilights are stronger than normals, to the point that they can dodge bullets and kill you with their bare hands. But Twilights need a drug called \"Celebrer\" to survive, a drug that normals fabricate (couldn't twilights learn how to fabricate some nice drugs? Really?).\r\nLots of normals hate twilights and some use 'em as slaves (despite twilights are so bloody strong they could put humanity at their feet), some kill 'em, very few actually help 'em. That's the contextwhere our protagonists (one twilight, one normal) try to survive doing whatever they can.\\n\r\nThe plot is well paced and quite intriguing in the first 8 episodes, then it is so rushed and so bad developed that it left a bad taste in my mouth.  In addition, the end has a lot of plot holes that makes you wish for a second season, but it will never come since Manglobe (the studio that produced the show) filed for bankruptcy.\\n\\n\r\n-Art: 7\\n\r\nI really liked a lot the art and it fits in a satisfactory way, but the animation was... well, a little bit disappointing.\\n\\n\r\n-Sound: 7\\n\r\nEvery character had its right seiyuu. I did not found any character with a voice not fitting with his/her personality.\\n\r\nThe OST is fine; nothing memorable except Alex performance in chapter 8. That song suited very nice with the chapter events.\\n\\n\r\n-Characters: 7\\n\r\nNico is a captivating character with a dark past. Same as Worrick, despite he is not captivating, but rather \"the guy that acts cool\". Alex is a hot gyal that used to be a prostitute and her development was well done. These three are the main protagonists of the show and their personalities are well developed. Not as the other. There are intriguing characters, each with a story to tell, like Marco, Paulklee, Dany,... but due to lack of money (what means lack of episodes, A LOT OF EPISODES) we got a show with enormous plot holes for almost every character.\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment: 7\\n\r\nI did enjoy the show besides its end.\\n\\n\r\n-Overall: 6\\n\r\nGangsta. had a huge potential to be a great show, sadly it is not.",

            "content": "Plot and Story Line\r\nThe whole Gangsta story is set in a small town named Ergastulum. When it comes to the city, it is a very dark, shady ville full of thieves, whores, corrupt cops and gangs. I think you all can imagine it in one way. In the heart of the story we have the two main characters: Worick and Nicolas. Two partners that do all kinds of odd jobs that nobody else wants to do. Now the thing that makes Gangsta different from other shows are Twilights. Twilights posses enchanted abilities due to their predecessors' use of Celebrer (some kind of drug). They arenoted for being incredibly violent and destructive and as such mostly hired for killing jobs. One of the Twilights in this anime is also Nick.\\n\r\nIn the show, a new character is introduced right in the beginning. A prostitute called Alex. She meets after Worick and Nick were assigned to kill Alex's boss. In the end Alex ends up as the one killing her boss, and kinda teaming up with Worick and Nick. \\n\r\nI know you might be asking \"Is that it?\", and yeah that's basically it. That's the whole plot, but it is not a bad one. Here's why.\\n\r\nThe plot and story line are really slow. It is a step by step, firstly character introduction, then a \"setting introduction\" and at some points a flash-back story. The story gets all interesting in the ninth episode when so called \"Anti-Twilights\" appear. A battle between them starts and is still ongoing but the first season ended today. There are still no information about season two, but have hope, because the anime is actually manga based. We don't know for sure, but I think that season two will be aired because of the huge popularity that this anime has. \"Fingers crossed\". \\n\r\nNow the main thing that kept me watching Gangsta. The flashbacks and backstories. The story about Worick and Nick and how they meet is outstanding. I loved it and it really gets emotional in some parts. It's a story about friendship, humanity and family relations, so I recommend you not to miss it. There are also two more backstories that have my attention. The first one  is the backstory of Delico (Twilight) and his sibling sister Erica (Anti-twilight). I just think that for now the anime didn't give them the limelight they deserve. One more is also a sibling story, but now of Alex and her brother Emilio. These two backgroundstories have on thing in common (except the sibling part). They are still unfinished and left some questions in the first season, and that's exactly why I think that we can hope for a second season to air. \\n\r\nAlso an important thing that has to be mentioned is that this anime is perfect for all you action lovers out there. Epic and interesting fights. Guns, axes, swords...There are all kinds of weapons. It has some bloodshed, but  hey, as if you are not used to it. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nThe characters in Gangsta are just a bunch of badass gangsters, killer machines and ordinary characters that are there \"just because\". Some of them develop in one or the other way, and some of them are interesting due to their past, Delico for instance. Now here for you our two main guys, and my personal favorite in the show. \\n\\n\r\nWorick Arcangelo is a damn clever and brilliant person. In his cruel childhood he escaped his horrible reality trough books. Now he possesses the ability to read incredibly fast and the ability of photographic memory. Although being rich and having everything \"served on a silver-plate\" he just wanted a place to belong to. He finds a place next to Nick, or so he thinks. But does he really belongs in the world of Twilights by pretending or acting like one?   \\n\\n\r\nNIckolas (Nick) Brown. This guy is a Twilight. He is an incredible fighter and a killer machine, but he has a huge heart. A very considerate and nice person but not looking like one. The most interesting thing about Nick is his inability to talk. The way he uses sing language to communicate and how others interact with him is awesome. He is a \"Fake\", meaning he reaches his tag of A/0 by overdosing. He is actually ranked as B/5. Still his swordsman skills are outstanding. I loved seeing him fight. \\n\\n\r\nDoug looks like a 14-year-old kid, but is actually a grown up. Looking innocent but actually wearing an A/0 Tag. Quite dangerous. Doug is a side-character in Gangsta but I loved him because he looks so cute but is a killer machine in the same time. I have the feeling that I just want to squeeze his cheeks and say: \"You little devil, stop killing people\". I just wish we could have seen more of him in Gangsta.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Style\\n\r\nLadies and Gentlemen, welcome to 2015. You can clearly see the difference, or easier said, the better animation in the anime of 2014/2015. Gangsta is one of those. Awesome animation. Smooth, good contrast, clear, good colors and outline. In short, I loved it. \\n\r\nThe style is also from a new generation. The high contrast shadows gave it a good taste and the good work with details made it incredible. \\n\r\nNow one more thing that has to be mentioned is definitely the music. It is epic. For example the opening. It is catchy and the only anime-opening I didn't skip while watching. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\r\nConclusions were always my favorite part of every speech, essay and review because I put all my thoughts in a few sentences and as if you will remember everything you read above. \\n\r\nNow to conclude, Gangsta is a dark anime that tells a story about friendship and humanity. It is realistic in some parts but becomes an \"anime\" after some time. Full of action, heart breaking stories and interesting characters. I rate it as a 8.45, minus points for the slow story development, but on the whole definitely worth watching it. I'd give it a try!\\n\\n\r\nYour AnimeGirl",

            "content": "It\u2019s not often you see an anime putting its setting into uncharted territory. It is a welcoming addition to the constant routine of anime studios just churning out shows that present a Japanese environment so that a Japanese audience can be easily engaged. With a unique setting backed by an equally unique title, Gangsta, that will at least be an excellent first impression going into it. What came through my mind when Gangsta was over was how much of a great thrill ride it was, except for the bumpy journey that was part of it.\r\nGangsta\u2018s setting is not the only thing that makes it unique.The characters and subject matter the writers created and produced had a stark, gritty tone to them that was interesting enough to keep me hooked. This type of direction they chose is honestly one of the stronger feats to Gangsta.  Another anime that delved into this similar atmosphere was Black Lagoon, however, the way Gangsta and Black Lagoon treated their atmosphere are entirely different. Black Lagoon was trying to invoke black comedy in its story and characters, while Gangsta\u2019s felt more serious and focused less on humor. I can appreciate both of these types of atmospheres equally if the writers can add substance to them that make them engaging. It\u2019s just unfortunate that Gangsta can\u2019t seem to figure this point out when trying to make a cohesive narrative to complement its atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nIn the beginning, I was hooked by the story and how well they introduced the characters. The build-up was great by the first half of Gangsta to let us get to know our three main protagonists at first so that they can establish a kinship against various mob groups. All of that was nicely handled; until it introduced even more characters. You can say that Gangsta has the big issue of having a story that is the equivalent of a 24 episode anime length, and squeezing it into 12 episodes. It is evident by the halfway point since we\u2019re introduced to too many plot points that are not expanded upon very well and make the process of figuring it all out frustrating. Characters that are a part of the Twilights, except for Nicolas, are incredibly forgettable and bland from how little of an impression they make besides the intense action sequences they take part in.\\n\\n\r\nThe parts where the plot does work are the flashback sequences of Nicolas and Worwick. They give a nicely made, depressing picture of our two tortured henchmen that adds a nice layer of depth to make us feel sympathetic to the paths that they, unfortunately, had to take to survive. There is not any similar treatment for our main female protagonist, Alex. Nevertheless, a torturous backstory for her was not needed since we get a nicely directed psychological distress from her that let us understand the trauma she was/is going through from her past life as a prostitute. Her growth from being in that abusive world to being on stage singing a tearful song to people was impressive to see. Still, with all the positives for the development of our three main characters, that\u2019s all the plot has going for it. What is left is a bunch of half-baked supporting characters and a plot that does not know where its focus is once it reaches the halfway point. Eventually, it leads up to an ending that feels like a cheap cliffhanger that makes us wait for a sequel to happen.\\n\\n\r\nBesides their development, the main cast is in-of-themselves relatively charming and great to see. Nicolas being deaf offers an interesting character arc that adds to the unique nature of Gangsta. His banter with Worwick using his sign language feels natural and humorous in many scenarios that are involved with it. Not only with Worwick, but also Alex who tries her best to form a connection with him despite not knowing sign language. My only major concern was how little they expanded upon Alex trying to learn sign language to deepen her relationship with Nicolas, but that could be for the sequel\u2019s job to make that a reality. Besides his chemistry, Nicolas comes across as mysterious but likable in how he treats the people who are close to him.\\n\\n\r\nWorwick\u2019s troubled life as a gigolo, a male prostitute, is interesting in one episode where they go to a brothel that makes him a vulnerable person than what most people perceive him to be. Despite this, he often comes across as strong-minded and fair in how he deals with various situations that arise. With his sarcastic tongue and the deafness of our other male hero, they form a fascinating duo that can be described as opposites working together as friends from their childhood upbringings. Nevertheless, out of the three lead roles, my favorite would have to Alex. Not just from her beautiful looks, but how she tries to deal with her trauma after being saved from that tormented life had me hooked to her from beginning to end. Her fascinating growth from the bottom to the top was both engaging and tragically moving to see.\\n\\n\r\nGangsta\u2019s character designs bear a resemblance to Michiko no Hatchin since they are both animated by the same studio, Manglobe. In keeping its tradition of stellar character designs, Gangsta is another winner in how distinct the characters look from most anime. The skin tone and facial features give all the characters their unique look. Animation, while cutting corners here and there, is serviceable to the action sequences and momentary talking scenes. What is breathtaking is the art design of the world itself. It adds to the raucous atmosphere it perpetuates from the bright red blood to the dark, dank alleyways scattered throughout the city.\\n\\n\r\nGangsta was only a partial disappointment for me. Of course, most of the problems I have could be amended with a sequel, or, god help me, \u201dread the manga if it does not sell enough BDs.\u201d As it stands on its own, this season did not deliver on its story halfway through as much as its technical and main characters had to offer. Despite my grievances with it, the effects of my positives outweigh my perception of Gangsta. I grew attached to the main characters in more ways than one that saved Gangsta for me. When you still want a sequel to an anime to see more of the characters despite not liking the plot, that at least can be something to admire for it.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: B",

The show starts off a bit muddled, the setting is somewhat confused as it seems to be some version of Italy, yet people speak with poor New York accents and I sort of wish they had just gone with one of the two instead of a hodgepodge of both so they could throw in all the mobster stereotypes they could. The two main leadsstart out, in all honesty, as frankly detestable, though as you learn of their origins and the mythos of the world, their plight does become more understandable and they start to grow on you.\\n\\n\r\nThe action is fun, as is the gritty, X-Men-esque genetically enhanced super human discrimination premise. The bond between the two leads and the woman they try to protect from falling into their world of violence and crime is endearing and has a genuine sense of care and comradery, but the villains do come off as more than a bit cartoonish, even if it does make them all the more hateable for it. Overall, I was heavily hooked by the end, but the end came so abruptly and without a sequel, so much remains unanswered. I think it would have fared much better as a 24 or so episode series instead of 12 episodes with a next part that may never come. In the end, I enjoyed the time spent with the tortured team of badass anti-heroes, but the reasons above keep GANGSTA. at a slightly above average 7 out of 10 for me.",

It didn't complete the story and literally leaves you hanging on a thread with a plot you feel deserves another 5 episodes to fully complete. To get what I was missing I went to the manga. Sure it continues the plot to an extent, THEN IT STOPS. I feel Gangsta could be much more but then it leaves you hanging. Almost like hunter x hunter with the incomplete plot. It's a great anime to watch.\r\nNow I have been praising the anime a lot, but there's more to it. The background story behind characters isn't sogood. There will be some character that has been in the anime that you will barely notice because of how little attention they give to them and then BOOM all of a sudden the character is very relevant to the plot. And I don''t mean relevant in a they affect the main character for a while then fade away just to add spice to the story. I mean plot-altering relevant.\\n\\n\r\nIf you can get past the little character background( this is most likely because of the small amount of episodes) and just watch the anime with a simple mind you might enjoy it.",

The delving into \"gangsta\" activity, mob behavior, pimping, and other sorts of crime felt new, and not simply there just for coolness factor, but actually a pretty decent attempt at World building I quite enjoyed. Throughout the anime, the art and direction was solid, not ground breaking, but consistently of good quality, and the music did it's purpose I suppose. I did enjoy the opening but don't remember much else.\r\nAs far as character goes, I really did like the main cast. There wasn't an insanely high emotional connection, but Idid legitimately care to learn of their pasts and futures. I felt that the presence of a character who is def and use of sign language was also well done, with clear attention to detail and voice acting. The characters were cool, and a pleasure to watch as well. \\n\\n\r\nNow for the criticisms after all that I just said. I give the story a 5 and the overall anime a 6 for the exact same reason. THERE IS NO ENDING. I mean that the story simply stops in the middle of it all. There is no actual attempt at a conclusion, it's more like all of a sudden the next 40 episodes got lost. The way character backstories and narratives were handled was interesting, and well done, IF the story would have continued. But given it's abrupt \"ending\" they are simply left feeling underdeveloped and sporadically done. If there was a legitimate continuation I could see myself giving this anime a solid 8 to weak 9, but this anime screamed read the manga by the end, so if the story still interests you, I would suggest doing just that, though I have yet to do so, I do intend to.",

            "content": "Story -6-\r\nThe story follows two men that have the job as \u2018Handymen\u2019 in their city. Nikolas Brown and Worick Arcangelo are not the typical definitions of handymen in our world, as instead of fixing a sink or other appliances they are more like hired thugs. They tend to help the law more often other thugs, however, like most \u2018handymen\u2019 in the city. The officer Chad calling on them the most often. Now the story would have been rather bland, but it is introduced that one of the men, Nikolas is something more than human, a \u2018Twilight.' He has pills that he must consume to keephis powers in check, but he regularly overdoses on them so that he can be stronger than he normally is.\\n\r\nThe season mainly focuses on the upcoming war that is coming to a head in the streets. People like Nikolas, the Twilights, are often mistreated and have rather strict laws put upon them to control them. One of the three families that control the law on the streets starts to act out however and starts to break those laws. The story is interesting as it is dealing with the idea of mistreatment of minorities by those who are not part of the minority group along with how different people in a relationship, be it a friendship or sexual relationship, have different views of those who are in that relationship. An example of this is how Worick, Nikolas and Alex (a woman the men pick up in their work) all try and understand why the others are acting the way they are.\\n\\n\r\nArt -6-\\n\r\nThis anime was trying to seek to attract a bit of a women audience I say this because nearly every man was drawn in an attractive manner. Not to say that the artists did not try to appeal to a presumed straight male audience. However, it was also the type of anime that was trying to stick close to the original art style of the manga, which wasn\u2019t bad. There wasn\u2019t anything that stood out as amazing or downright horrible. The most I can say is that many characters dressed the same way. This was maybe because they did not want to design a lot of different clothing choices for a huge cast of characters, but that would have made it a lot more interesting as a lot of the environment was gray. A splash of color on the characters to make them stick out more would have gone a long way.\\n\\n\r\nSound -7-\\n\r\nAgain, there wasn\u2019t anything that completely took away from the anime. However, I do have to praise Nikolas\u2019 voice actor, Tsuda Kenjirou, as Nikolas is a deaf character. Even though he uses sign language to communicate most of the time, some characters and events force him to use his voice. Tsuda did a wonderful job portraying the difficulty that Nikolas has when he uses a voice that he cannot hear. \\n\r\nIt was also a job well done on the voice actor\u2019s parts to speak in the slang that the characters would use. As this story mainly takes place in rough neighborhoods, many characters tended to use much slang. However, since Worick and a few other characters came from more privileged upbringings, they tended to use less slang. Keeping this in mind was critical as it kept Worick and the other character\u2019s structure in tack and did not let me down.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter -8-\\n\r\nThe different types of characters that are portrayed in Gangsta were one of the high points for me. Nikolas was showing that disability was not something that can stop people that have it in their mind that they can do something. Nikolas and Worick\u2019s relationship was partially interesting because they were two children when they meet, but both were abused horribly by their fathers. Their bond was made because they found each other and cared about each other, as Worick found someone else that knew what he was going through. However, the bond may be a bit tainted because once Worick discovered that Nikolas was deaf, he felt reasonable of taking care of Nikolas. Speaking of Worick, Worick is a character who brought up something new, at least in my experience, as he is the first character confirmed to be a gigolo or a male prostitute that I have seen. It is worth noting that he worked as a sex worker because of his abuse. It affected him every day, and it was shown rather clearly throughout the show. Alex displayed the aftereffects of drug addiction and being in an unhealthy relationship.\\n\r\nI fully enjoyed the character portrayal in this series and would solely recommend it based on these characters, whom I have come to care about and wish to see heal from these very real issues that they have to face.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment -7-\\n\r\nDespite the fact that the story is nothing that is going to blow anyone\u2019s mind, along with the art being rather unremarkable, I did enjoy this season. With the vocal work on Nikolas being very well done, along with the fun complex characters, it was something that I wanted to finish. I do find myself not totally sure of what is happening in the main story arc, though I am confident I know how each character feels about what is going on.\\n\r\nI am also sure of how the characters are affected by what is happening. The anime did a wonderful job in making sure that the characters felt like real people. This makes it easy to know who is being changed by what, and why I should care and so on. Also, while it does deal with rather serious issues, for its universe at least, and has a hefty tone sometimes, there are light, humorous times that make it, so it is not always a bitter pill to swallow.\\n\\n\r\nOverall -6.8-\\n\r\nGangsta is one of those animes where you either like it, or you do not. You are not likely to get into it because of the art style or for its plot, but if the characters can get your attention and make you care for them by the end of its first episode, then you are going to be hooked. The good thing is that Gangsta knows that its plot is not anything that\u2019s very special and it does not pretend like it is trying to state a significant message. Sometimes while animes seek to make a big message, the characters and plot seem as through it is far too over thought. Since Gangsta is not trying to do anything like that, it leaves far more room for making characters much more relatable, or at least complex enough to keep the audience captivated.\\n\r\nGangsta can play off what it knows it has going for it with its relatable characters, and that is what makes it good. It is easy to tell much effort went into making the characters; their backgrounds are as thoroughly explained to understand why there is gray area in their moral decisions. An important part of the characters is how biased they are and that you can see where they get this bias from. I would recommend at least trying it. If you find yourself attached to the characters, then by all means, keep watching, because otherwise, you will be bored and find it very hard to watch the whole season.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Gangsta. Review\r\nStory (7/10) Good\r\nMore Specifically (7.50/10)\r\nThe story for Gangsta is good mix of Gang related crews and supernatural scientifically enhanced humans this is what makes it different. I've already read the manga and I'm caught up so as a manga reader watching this anime adaptation nothing surprised me, it was more a refresher to the story and if Manglobe is staying accurate the the original source material and as far as it looks they quite a good job but the I do think they shouldn't have ended the season right were they did a little bit further where u know who dies in the mangaand you know who get's reveal as a bad guy is where I think they should have ended it, yes that would be a cliff hanger ending but what they gave us instead is a cliff hanger of an ending also, at least where I want them to end it would have made a season finale look more reasonable. To not spoil anymore this anime ends on chapter 28 of the manga when I feel it should have ended on chapter like 33. But I guess they chose 28 because that's the end of a volume and they felt it was a good stopping point which is fair enough.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation (7/10) Good\\n\r\nMore Specifically (7.25/10) \\n\\n\r\nThe Art in the anime was definitely more weird at times than normal. The art style for this anime on down times and the high points definitely looked way better in the manga and that's not usually the case these days so I'm disappointed that it ended up looking like how it did. The animation was ok also it was fine but I've seen better from Manglobe (Deadman Wonderland for example) so I'm also disappointed that it could be as good as their previous work.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10) Great\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is obviously the best thing for the anime. The anime opening is one of my favorites this anime season, the BGM is probably the best the anime season, the voice actors during dramatic scenes did an outstanding job (JP VA) and the sound effects for the sword play and gun play sound authentic. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8/10) Very Good\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Gangsta are all really great, if you get to know their back story because there is a lot of characters in the series and with the amount of episodes they have not every single character gets enough screen time for the viewer to know them by name instantly when seen. But I can assure you that they are all great characters even if this anime couldn't go into the amount of detail I think they deserved in order for all viewers to see what I see in them you kind of have to read the manga unfortunately to get a full understanding of them all. But as far as what we get from the main group I do think a little bit too much screen time went to Alex personally. Also one certain thing they completely removed from the manga that was the fact that Worick would kind around with Alex and grab her butt and boobs as a joke and then Alex would hit him, he did this multiple times in the manga and it was funny but it doesn't even exist in the anime version I have no reasonable clue why they would take it out of it's a seinen anime at the end of the day stay authentic. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10) Very Good\\n\\n\r\nI damn near kept up with Gangsta every week ready and excited to watch an episode especially have the bomb ass opening how can you not be hyped to watch the episode have listening to that opening!? Anyway I forgot how much dialogue was in the series vs actually physical conflict and fight scenes. So there were quite a few episodes of just characters just talking the entire episode and since I've already read the manga and as I said before the art style was better in the manga these scenes definitely got a bit boring to me which is why enjoyment only gets up to an 8.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7/10) Good\\n\r\nMore Specifically (7.95/10) Good+\\n\\n\r\nThe adaptation of Gangsta is a good one, could they have done better in the art style and animation department? FUCK YES, but as far as an adaptation this still very good. They obviously didn't try to wrap it up and do an anime original ending leaving us on a cliffhanger of a season finale which would make you assume a season 2 was at least taken into consideration. But knowing where the manga stands season 2 isn't coming anytime soon people as this is the Attack on Titan effect we are dealing with here.. a monthly manga. Anyway getting back to this season it was very good nothing more or less to say about it!",

            "content": "Too bad the ending of Gangsta. is a very underwhelming considering the main fact that Manglobe, an anime developer who is known for developing Ergo Proxy, Samurai Champloo and The God Only Knows Series, lead to bankruptcy. But, the question is... Who are the ones that needed to blame? Because the only guys they need to blame are themselves(Manglobe), because they're the ones who made their company suffer. And this anime is the last anime that lead to it's final nail to it's coffin. And because of their carelessness, here it is... The half-ass finished version of this anime came from one of the bestanime corporations out there... Manglobe (RIP)\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, let's review Manglobe's final nail in the coffin, Gangsta... And what am I going to say this? Well, this anime is really indeed... DISAPPOINTING. I can indeed follow how the flow of this anime is going, but thanks to so many underwhelming plot from the 2nd Episode to the last, I don't think this is recommendable to watch this anime.\\n\\n\r\nGangsta focuses more on about the crimes that is doing at Ergastulum, a small town full of mafias, drugs, hoodlums, prostitutes and dirty cops. Ergastulum is a pretty messed up city that it looks like the cops has no control in it whatsoever including the government.\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonists named as Worrick Arcangelo and Nicolas Brown are working as the \"Handymens\" (It's like Yorozuya Gin-Chan where they accept request from someone) who do their dirty jobs not just for the police but also the mobsters and mafias as well. For short, Handymens are just staying behind the spotlight and only acts as a assistants for their works. They also met a then-prostitute named Alex Benedetto who is now a assistant when it comes to oncoming calls.\\n\\n\r\nThe Plot is fine when it comes to the first episode but as we went thru each of it's episodes, it's a very complicated one actually. Also, there are so many unanswered conclusion here. Regarding what happens to the family of Alex Benedetto, the life of Worrick Arcangelo, will Nicolas will be able to make it, etc., I really do wanted to know more on about this, but it's sad to say that maybe we will never see the light of day for this series. But as for the backstory of the two main protagonist, it's okay for me because it tells about how these two main protagonist meet each other and how do they start their own business. The only thing that really criticizes the most is the freaking final episode, it's a cliffhanger. So, we see the final moments of Worrick jumping from the window, then talks about the twilights and that was it... Worrick lying on the ground, injured and slowing dying while raining... And I was like... really? That's the jizz of it? The fuck happened to the whole plot then, the explosions, the war between each mafia family, etc.. It's freaking disappointing though... and I really hate that...\\n\\n\r\nThe Art, it kinda looks like I'm watching a crime-drama from the 70s or older. The structures of the buildings and everything that surrounds it looks like it's came somewhere in North America or Europe. So, it's very stylish though.\\n\\n\r\nThe character development is not that good though, there are so many characters here but only plenty of it has that kind of it. Also, the characters here are done good enough. But, thanks to it's lack of next episodes due to the bankruptcy, I should say it's pretty damn raw to see this anime.\\n\\n\r\nI'm very disappointed on how they deliver this anime. It's so sad that one of the most underrated yet talented anime corporation went down it's core because of it's overwhelming debts over the past years. I'm really looking forward to this anime because, hell, Manglobe is great when it come to delivering the anime amongst fans. I'm really sad that after all these times of making this anime, this is the only ending they have. It's not very well executed, and I really can't believe how awful it is to end the legacy of Manglobe.\\n\\n\r\nBut, who cares though, there are tons of Manglobe anime that for you to watch on to. So, if you're planning to watch this anime, I consider for you to watch Ergo Proxy, it's a damn-fine material. If you're not on about mechas clashing like Transformers or Gundam Series, then this is a right anime for you. If you like mysteries like Death Note, then yeah... Ergo Proxy!\\n\\n\r\nBut not this... I really don't want you to watch this anime, It's raw, it's unfinished, and most of all, NOT GOOD...\\n\\n\r\nRIP Manglobe, and RIP Gangsta...",

However, the police found a way out. They hired two people called \u201cBenriya.\u201d And now the two are the only hope of Ergastulum. Will they maintain order, or perhaps the burden will be too heavy for them to carry? Watch Gangsta and find out about it right now!\r\nStory (9/10)\r\nIn the city of Ergastulum, where no one has ever heard about such things as law and order, whereseeing death is absolutely normal and where gangsters have all the power, the police are nothing but an illusion. However, the police found a way out. They hired two people called \u201cBenriya.\u201d And now handyman is the only force, which is able to bring back the order in that toxic environment. Without a doubt, they are not doing it for free. In exchange for that, the police pay a fantastic sum of money for what they do, and they also close their eyes on everything that the Benriya do. \\n\\n\r\nGangsta leaves a way too many unanswered questions and it makes the wait for the new episode almost impossible. It is an open secret that in most cases anime try to explain everything to its viewer. Gangsta, however, hints things little by little taking care of your own enjoyment. It will never be boring for you, as you will have to remember many things about the storyline and Gangsta\u2019s protagonists. Little by little collecting the pieces of mosaic, you will surely appreciate the result. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, after watching so many series revolving around high school kids, Gangsta will be a pleasant surprise for you. Be ready for its darkness, and the show will surely reward you. \\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10)\\n\r\nThe art is good. You will surely like the character design; however, they should have paid more attention to the show\u2019s background. \\n\\n\r\nSound (6/10)\\n\r\nThe biggest problem of Gangsta is, of course, its sound. Yes, as always, the voice actors did one hell of a job making their characters alive; however, when it comes to OST, it is simply horrible. I mean, why not add some jazz melodies? Sometimes Gangsta screamed for a good background music. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening and endings songs do fit the show well. While the opening song gives you a desire to live on, the ending song is more depressive and sorrowful. But still they are not something to die for. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (9/10)\\n\r\nOur two main characters, the Benriya, are like brothers. We see that they have known each other for almost eternity. Yet, the reason for their nearness will be explained a bit later. The Benriya has 3 members:\\n\\n\r\nThe first Benriya is Arcangelo Worick. Worick is the brain of Benriya and the only force able to control his powerful companion, Nicolas. He looks weak but when the situation demands actions, he will show himself as a very smart strategist who will solve every possible difficulty on his way.\\n\\n\r\nThe second Benriya is Brown Nicolas. Nic is the team's muscle. Little is known about his superhuman power. Yet, we know that he is called \u201ctwilight\u201d and that he gains superhuman power using a certain drug. He is also something very rare for anime: a disabled person, to be precise. Nicolas is deaf, but Gangsta treats his condition with a big respect. It\u2019s rare that we see protagonists with disabilities in anime, and animation studio Manglobe did a great job of picturing his disability, most of the characters Nicolas interacted with, had already known about his disability. Some even learned the sign language to talk to him. However, it doesn\u2019t mean that he can\u2019t speak, he can and when he does so, saying that you will amazed will be the same as saying nothing. It is something you should hear by yourself. \\n\\n\r\nAnd finally the third Benriya is Alex Benedetto. She is an ex-prostitute saved by the two Benriya. Now, she works as their secretary. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the anime\u2019s cast is nearly flawless. Even supporting characters are all interesting to follow. However, the main problem of this anime is Alex. She is the weakest link of Gangsta and it is just unclear whether she wants to change herself of not. I am not trying to say that her change should have made her a pro assassin, no, but her character should have shown that she wanted to change herself. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10)\\n\r\nSaying that Gangsta is a masterpiece would be wrong. Yet, it is able to keep you exciting and that show does it good. After all these boring romcoms, seeing Gangsta will surely help you to draw a deep breath.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8.4/10)\\n\r\nIf Black Lagoon and Jormungand were interesting to you, then seeing Gangsta will be the right choice. Gangsta is very similar to these two anime,but don\u2019t expect to see something different. \\n\\n\r\nGangsta is not a show about a superman who wields katana like a professional. The concept of superpower in Gangsta is well-explained and the show, overall, makes sense. Do you want to see a spectacular action, which \u201cmakes sense?\u201d Then what are you waiting for?",

            "content": "Watching Gangsta is like taking drugs, yet you are clean.\r\nI\u2019d like Worrick to be my dad - Gangsta review\r\nWe\u2019re introduced into Ergastulum, a city free of reign from most of the authority, lead by four figures of different factions. Our main heroes of the series, Nicolas Brown and Worrick Arcangelo, otherwise known as the \u2018handymen\u2019, because they will take jobs no one else will do, going through a series of events that reveal bits of their past. While the ending was disappointing for leaving on a cliffhanger, the series as a whole still offers subtle moments of relaxation and enjoyment.\r\nSince the first episode, Nicolas andWorrick convey their dynamic through their dialogue and conversation. Though being deaf, Nicolas uses sign language to communicate, and when he speaks it makes it all the more interesting. He has a very subtle coolness to him that makes him all the more lovable. Worrick is quite charming and charismatic the way he is well portrayed in the how. He taught Nicolas sign language and how to speak when they were younger showing that they both need one another even if being a normal doesn\u2019t fit him into the world of Twilights. \\n\\n\r\nGangsta has an interesting contained story and setting. The Twilights are descendents of those who use the drug \u2018celebrer\u2019 in order to stay alive and function, and often of mental and physical disorders. They wear tags to show their level of strength. And normally, there are people who are against them and willing to kill them. That is where the three principles comes in. It\u2019s stated to protect Twilights and the abuse of them but who really listens to the law, right? As the show progresses, we see a number of people who bare hatred against the Twilights for the danger they pose. In the last few episodes we  are introduced to Hunters who hunt Twilights. They seem to be normals from what we\u2019re shown in the anime, however highly skilled and trained equal or better than Twilights. I thought this was the weakest part of the show\u2019s narrative as it was left in a poorly done ambiguous way, unintentionally. The 12 episodes restriction hampered the overall narrative which completely disengaged me at times. But it is the characters and the calmness of conversations between characters that help keep the enjoyment there.\\n\\n\r\nThe art of the show is well done. There are times where characters look awkward, but for the most part it is good and the style fits with the mature contents of the series. The animation was serviceable. Most of the time it\u2019s peaceful moments and not as much intense action for the animators to go all out. Voice acting is good. It gave me the notion like I was watching a noir film. Worricks charismatic voice just touches the ears very smoothly. Nicolas\u2019s voice nailed it. He sounded very badass and cool when the moments called for him to speak with his mouth. I like it that the show is filled with adults so for the most part I\u2019m not drained out of my mentality by squeaky voices. It is all done in a very mature manner. The opening and ending touched my ears very pleasureful. The opening was way too freaking cool, not for it\u2019s amazing animation or whoa factor, it is just so very chill.\\n\\n\r\nI have a personal bias for this show even for it\u2019s loss of a compelling story in a restricted environment of 12 episodes. But objectively speaking, it has the characters and setting, but the story is weakened greatly because of it\u2019s limited screen time to at least give something meaningful til the end. And that is why Gangsta earns a 7/10. I\u2019m being nice to this show because of my personal story. So for anyone else considering watching this, it would probably be a 6/10.  However it still earns my Netflix and Chill seal of approval because of how cool the characters are and the damn soundtrack is just so noir like. I always imagine a scene in the bar drinking with a pal or lady with the music playing in the background. It\u2019s not something I can recommend because of a lack of a complete story for a season. And I hope that season 2 is on its way.",

            "content": "Gangsta is one of those action anime that is more grounded in reality when compared to its competition. There\u2019s no Mech\u2019s flying all over the place, no one is literally throwing fire or lighting around the joint, and there\u2019s no incest vampire twins or a terminator esque maid trying to kill the main cast. Sorry to disappoint you.\r\nThe Short Version:\r\n(+)Different location other than Japan (Yes that\u2019s a good thing.)\r\n(+)Tiny cast of characters gives them opportunities to be fleshed out.\r\n(+)OP tells you exactly what to expect.\r\n(+)They made a deaf person intimidating.\r\n(-)Subtle storytelling doesn\u2019t equal good storytelling.\r\n(-)Apart from the OP the sound isn\u2019t really that special.\r\nThe Story(7/10):\\n\r\nA problem that anyone could have with an action anime with an overabundance of story-telling, is the possibility of sacrificing screen time that could be used for badass fight scenes, as opposed to bland exposition. That\u2019s why Gangsta tells its story more by slipping the details of the world into the background. For example, a radio will be playing as the main characters are talking to someone else about something, and if you pay attention the radio will let slip some details about the world and Twilights.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll put up a warning right now, don\u2019t expect this show to come flying out of the gate with action and blood and ALL that good shit you came to see. Don\u2019t worry there\u2019s plenty of blood in the first episode, but to be honest (and this is probably just me) the show is boring for the first half or so, and then the second half of the show happens and HOLY SHIT. Let\u2019s just say that some of the questions you had in the first half are explained and that the shit collectively hits the fan at the speed of a fighter jet. Now I come to the weak part of the story, the ending. The ending tells you one thing and one thing clearly. Go read the manga, because these endings suck the story is getting a 7 instead of an 8 from me.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters (8/10):\\n\r\nThis is one of the two reasons I like this anime. The characters, especially the main troupe of characters, are great. Now to do what I normally do and give a quick description of each main character.\\n\\n\r\nWorick Arcangelo: The brains behind the Handymen, lifetime \u2018friend\u2019 to Nicolas, and has something similar to total recall.\\n\\n\r\nNicolas Brown: A-Class Twilight, and most intimidating deaf person I\u2019ve ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nAlex Benedetto: Ex-whore and secretary to the Handymen.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a few side characters that grabbed my attention but these three are the main reasons you will be watching this show. The interaction between Nicolas and Worick tell how close they are, and how long they\u2019ve been working as the Handymen. Worick and Alex have cute little exchanging, but it ultimately feels like Worick is teaching Alex how to survive in this world she\u2019s now a part of, and when Nicolas is with Alex he\u2019s a bit distant but later on he starts genuinely caring for her, and I thought one scene between the two of them in the later half was rather sweet.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art and Sound (6/10) & (7/10):\\n\r\nThe art is the other reason I like this show, while not the most fluid stuff you\u2019ll ever see, it does a good job considering what the shows content is. Blood comes in buckets and the Twilights fight like I would imagine people who are hopped up on performance enhancing drugs would fight. The character designs are alright, the only problem is apart from a variety of suits, there\u2019s no real unique designs anywhere, the only design that caught my attention was Alex\u2019s because of her two\u2026\u2026distracting.....mounds.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is kinda meh honestly, apart from the OP there\u2019s only one other moment that I really enjoyed the sound. The voice acting was standard across the board, but special mention to Nicolas\u2019 voice actor. Good job mate, you made a deaf person sound scary as fuck, and all of the sound effects for fight and such are what I\u2019d expect from an anime from 2015\\n\\n\r\nWhat do you think of this anime?\\n\\n\r\nI think I might buy this when I can, but only if there\u2019s a second season otherwise no, I won\u2019t put money into it.\\n\\n\r\nWould you recommend this anime?\\n\\n\r\nYeah I would, if you like shows like Black Lagoon for instance that this show will definitely be your cup of tea. If you\u2019re more into the light-hearted-moe-slice-of-life shows, you\u2019re probably not going to enjoy it as much.\\n\\n\r\nGoodbye my brethren, see you in the next one.",

            "content": "One of the most unfortunate cases of adaptation in recent times. \r\nGangsta lured many fans through the promise of 'maturity' alone: actual adult characters, a gritty  crime-infested setting that recall to mind the likes of noir and gangster flicks, and ultraviolence. It certainly started out promising enough, introducing three principal characters with significant amount of baggage (in its 2Male+1Female dynamic and thematic thread of 'escape from the past' linking them, there's a strong whiff of Cowboy Bebop) and establishing a slow burn atmosphere that may disappoint those looking for more 'punch shoot explode' type of series, but hugely appeals to fans of intricate characterdrama that addressed and incorporated heavy themes (e.g. marginalization, drug dependency, sex worker abuse) in fairly respectful manner. Despite its nature, Gangsta never gets too bleak or cynical, as the warm interplay between the characters reflected a considerably sized heart and sentimentality beneath all the grit. Hearing-impaired Nicolas Brown, along with the use of sign language that entailed this detail, also lend a distinct flavor to the set-up by being one of the few representations of disabled protagonist.  \\n\\n\r\nThen, it kind of went downhill.\\n\\n\r\nThere's always an awkward amalgamation of seinen (setting, main protagonists, ultraviolence, general feel and pace) and shounen (certain supporting characters, power rankings, romanticization of characters to some extent) elements in Gangsta, and while this in itself isn't a bad thing, the more juvenile bits really don't mesh well. At some point, Gangsta is dragged down by haphazardly animated fight scenes, some character design that looked like rejects from Naruto/One Piece rogue gallery, and messily developed conflict. Much worse, Manglobe's internal issues became increasingly apparent and resulted in a fatal miscalculation: the series' pacing and overall composition would only made sense if it's something like 50-episode series instead of something four times shorter. The swelling number of characters, sub-plots, and individual arcs (made worse by oftentimes ineffective exposition, editing, and cross-cutting) is something the show eventually couldn't handle, eventually crashing out with a horribly abrupt non-ending that left loose threads all over the place and basically left the viewers with a feeling that they've watched what amounted to an extended ad of the manga.\\n\\n\r\nIt all became more understandable after news about Manglobe's demise came to light, but it's still a darn shame. Credits where it's due, though: Gangsta has its considerable share of graceful isolated moments, and even with all its problems (both inherent and external), it's still a memorable production with potent setting and principal characters. This is an adaptation that screamed out for way more time and resource that its production studio didn't, and sadly, wouldn't ever have.",

I like the scene that is shown characters who are related withthe events(i don't remember the episode). There were problems about some characters' appearances i will talk about it at character section.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND -8-\\n\\n\r\nI like the dubstep soundtrack during fights, it really makes me exciting.I like some parts with soft, slow soundtracks.I wish i could have heard in more parts these soundtracks.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER -7-\\n\\n\r\nWe see a few flashbacks of Nicolas and Worick, their appearances were depicted good considering their ages.We see main characters' pasts it's okey but when i heard some other characters' name, i couldn't remember their face maybe it's because they were not introduced enough (or maybe it's because of my memory xd) Finally, when i see some characters with their funny, non-serious appearances, all of those illegalities are gone.\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT -6,5-\\n\\n\r\nWouldn't it be better if you don't know who will win the fight ? Exactly it would be better but you can predict that who will win because of the levels of dog-tags.Lastly, there were lots of one-sided fights(i mean Hunters...)\\n\r\nHowever, fight scenes were good.\\n\\n\r\n Last of all, Gangsta. was good(7).

So here I'm telling you reasons why wathing it could be right or wrong. It will be quick and painless.\r\nStory:\r\nYes: bands, prostitutes and problems between those bands in a fictional city. Three main protagonists exposed to that kind of life. What makes it a little bit different is the well set backstory of all of this and the pace in which those events occur. It knows how to get you uneasy at the end of each episode.\r\nThe ending (in advice) seemsto lead to a second season though.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nWell, sincerely, the animation is a little bit poor sometimes, but it's a good job anyway. I don't usually complain about animation except on some extreme cases (not this one).\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nSome funky, electro-funky gangsta-badass music in the background is what will highlight when you watch it. Nothing more to say. Oh yes, loved the opening tune.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThere're no flat characters. Main protagonists have their own past, and this past is well placed and developed. I really like the depth this anime gives to its characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI actually enjoyed this anime. It looks like the typical \"punch somewhere, fight somewhere else\" at the first episode, but you'll see it's more than that. And when you realize it, you'll really enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nOne of the best series of the season, I recommend watching it to try something else. I mean, to escape from school and dailylife mainstream.",

It just stays the same throughout the whole series, plain and boring. As far as the characters go, the only one's story worth mentioning is Nicolas. Just because of him, I got the courage to continue watching this anime. Gangsta takes place in an unlawful city, full of mafia, thieves etc. It's almost colorless too (I sort of like to have at leastsome vibrant colors in an anime). Therefore, I would say that this anime is okay for time passing, when you have no better things to watch.\\n\\n\r\nI expect to see a better elevation of the story in Season 2 (If it is scheduled)",

            "content": "You know what's worse than a bad anime?\r\nA disappointing one.\r\nThe sad truth is, Gangsta was filled with a lot of promise from the start. It looked like it was to be a mix of Jormungand and Black Lagoon, a winning blend of action, drugs, street culture, and violence. The anime I envisioned was going to be a lot more gritty, dark and realistic than what we'd received. Of course, I can't exactly blame the anime for defying my expectations; if it wanted to be more focused on the bishonen and the superpower aspect then that could work too. Unfortunately, here, it just was not executedwell.\\n\\n\r\nTaking place in a fictional city where the crime runs rampant, our main characters - a deaf man named Nic and a gigolo named Worick - function as handymen, cleaning up jobs that not even the police would like to sully their hands with. Initially, the environment of the city that we're introduced to is entertaining in its own right; thriving with gangs, prostitutes and seedy dealers, the first episode gives the impression of an episodic series, chronicling the odd jobs of these two handymen and the newly acquired Alex, whom soon is functioning as their receptionist. It's a very promising start, brimming with action, a unique character in the form of Nic and a hip, catchy opening theme that certainly can't be beaten.\\n\\n\r\nToo bad it's all downhill from there.\\n\\n\r\nYou know for an anime titled 'Gangsta' I was expecting something, well, gangsta. Instead what we get are drugs that induce superpowers, a ton of characters with absolutely no point or purpose, fizzling plot points put on the back-burner and the culminating finale that eventuates into sheer nothingness. Before I expand upon these elements, however, let's try and get the good out of the way first.\\n\\n\r\nThe shining aspect of the series is Nic and Worick, our two leads with quite the haunted past. Nic is a powerful force to be reckoned with and is one of the few characters I've seen in anime to have a properly represented disability. Although not particularly well developed or formed at all, the two make quite the interesting duo and their warm relationship is a spotlight amid a circle of rather bland, wasted potential.\\n\\n\r\nOn the topic of great things to come from this anime, the opening theme is as snazzy and catchy as an opening can get. It conveys the 'gangster' aspect better than the actual anime itself, and it's one of the few OPs that you'll have trouble skipping over. \\n\\n\r\nThere's also no shortage of entertainment here; it's interesting to see the twisted, slummy world of the city these two inhabit; often I found myself enjoying the ridiculous, logic-defying fight scenes, the small moments where the gangs are given screen time and the bustling clubs and hideouts. It reminded me closely of Black Lagoon, where the cities are as dangerous and unpredictable as can be and even the oldest of grannies will tote guns.\\n\\n\r\nSo, what's wrong with Gangsta?\\n\\n\r\nIt's less of what's wrong per say, and more about what it wastes.\\n\\n\r\nFirstly, the plot. There's a system introduced early on known as the 'Tags,' which is practically a glorified rating system of someone's fighting ability. From here things get convoluted, with different ranking tags making appearances, then disappearing without even doing so much as a serving to driving the story forward. The side missions are often bland and uninspired, more filler than anything else, and it's as if, while this anime meanders along, it has no clear path to follow. \\n\\n\r\nThere's a lack of decisiveness here; directionless, with no set path that it seems content to take, it ends up simply chasing its own tail in one confused loop. Characters will jump in, jump out, only to never be seen again; what was the point of Ginga? Gina? Doug? Hell, even Alex - one of the main characters and a redeemed prostitute we're supposed to care for - ends up as simply being a deadweight; the writers try and incorporate a traumatic past for her arc, but it does nothing to serve the overall story and it feels like her only purpose outside of arm-candy for our leads is to be the big-breasted, humping caboose for all the peeps wanting a slice of fanservice out there. Seriously, those boobs of hers are out of this world.\\n\\n\r\nAll of this culminates into a jumbled mess for the last few episodes; again, unsure on where it's heading, Gangsta simply tangles itself further in threads, abandoning old characters and introducing new ones merely an episode before the anime is to end. And of course, that ending, which isn't so bad per say as it is completely abrupt and unsatisfying, hardly even worthy of being called an ending. It felt like the setup for the finale, as opposed to the actual finale itself.\\n\\n\r\nI don't blame Manglobe for this by the way. They've always been a unique studio, unafraid to test the waters with offbeat, unique series; perhaps whilst they do fine in the west, they've struggled to find a footing in their homeland, and ultimately this has begun to lead to a decline of profits. I'm sure they wanted to give more than what they offered with Gangsta; unfortunately, TV executives and producers decide for the company how many episodes they're allowed, and perhaps they were completely rushed to push this project out as a last-ditch effort before bobbing under. \\n\\n\r\nIt shows, from the anime's erratic pacing to the ending where it literally just cuts off - and even to the animation which, while fine in some respects, is clearly degraded in quality in others. Apart from the opening theme music is repetitive and background songs simply loop, rather disjointed from the actual scene at hand. Voice acting is fine; the dub is passable, but treads familiar ground with all too familiar voice actors, whilst the original Japanese version's acting is just above average. Nic's voice actor pulls off what little lines he has well, whilst Worick has a snide, almost playful delivery, which meshes well with his character. \\n\\n\r\nCertain action scenes are better in quality compared to others; I can recall one fight where the animation truly shines, being fast-paced, well-choreographed and a thrilling rush to watch. Unfortunately, the rest of the action is mostly jerky and plain; character models are well-designed, but vary in quality from scene to scene, and the rest of the animation simply feels slow and lulling, nothing like the hardcore gangster fights we thought we were to be promised.\\n\\n\r\nMy heart aches for Manglobe, it really does; Gangsta shows its budget, from animation to sound and even to the writing; which is truly a shame because, with a bit more faith from TV executives, it really could've been something special. They had a great director on board, an interesting idea to expand off, two unique main characters and a setting brimming with possibilities. Instead, we see Manglobe's last anime start off with a bang and fizzle out into a whimper; an ambitious try, one last risk from the strong studio, though this time it simply does not pay off.\\n\\n\r\nI give Gangsta a \\n\\n\r\n5.40/10\\n\\n\r\nAVERAGE\\n\\n\r\nWith a recommendation to Skip It\\n\\n\r\nI normally hate saying this, but if you're so interested in the plot and the characters then read the manga. Gangsta is honestly a waste of time; a harmless waste of time, but a waste nonetheless. If you want hardcore action anime then try Jormungand or Black Lagoon; Gangsta just fails to deliver, even on its title, which is incredibly disheartening. Perhaps a bigger budget and more episodes could've made all the difference - or would even that have simply failed? Is there simply no longer a place in the industry for the risk-taking studios like Manglobe to try and provide something different from the hordes of moe junk we've been receiving?\\n\\n\r\nI certainly hope that isn't the case.\\n\\n\r\nGOOD;; Two interesting main characters, one, in particular, being very unique and fun to watch; a veil of entertainment value coats the series; that kickass opening theme!!\\n\\n\r\nMIXED;; Mediocre animation; disengaging, pointless arcs that go nowhere; a weak storyline\\n\\n\r\nBAD;; Characters with no purpose; directionless; fails to deliver on all that it wants to be; an unsatisfying 'ending', not even worthy of being titled as a finale\\n",

Less than a \"normal's\" worth, they are feared, hated and killed.\r\nThecity this story takes place in is the only place where tags can live, thanks to a delicate balance created by \"Four Fathers\".\\n\\n\r\nAs I said, the plot is nothing special but far from dull.\\n\\n\r\nArt 7: Suits the setting perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9: I should probably give it a full 10, It's even better than the Characters which are incredibly well fleshed out.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9: Nicolas, Worrick, Alex, Munroe, Nina, Theo, Constance, and so many more. And you'd love them all. You'd pity the old woman begging to see her grandaughter. Enjoy the banter between the \"slave\" and his \"contarctor\". Respect the virtue of the degenerates.\\n\\n\r\nThere's a lot to enjoy\\n\\n\r\nThis whole anime is a tender exploration-not so tender at times- into the ravaged lives of misfits.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10: There's humor, OUTSTANSTANDING action-sequences, a few tear-jerkers; blood, babes and battles , it's got enough of it all to keep you perfectly entertained.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9: It's a rather intelligent anime, with great characters, a story that's heads-and-shoulders better than a lot of \"masterpieces\"  and interesting music.\\n\\n\r\nI'll be watching it again. Maybe you should give it at least a try.",

The Drugs that I've mentioned may not be a typical narcotics that we know, but in this anime Celebrer are the representation of the said drugs in this anime and the twilights are the addicts (for the lack of a better word). For me to give this category a high score of 8, was that it shows a kind of dark entertainment which can only be enjoyed by more matured audiences or those with deep understanding on how the world of Crime and Corruption works in the city that was based on a certain Italian town that has experience such turmoil in the past and still reeling from it up to this day.\\n\\n\r\nArt (up), I gave it a good score since the illustration didn't rely on the typical moe thingy, also the art were done in apportion to the setting of the anime or manga and Alex's illustration really did make her character the way it was expected as a helpless whore .\\n\\n\r\nSound (up), I also gave it a good score since the seiyuus who did the voices were also appropriate  for the setting, also the opening them is appropriate for this anime. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter (up) I could have given this category a high score, but unfortunately, as an anime it has too still rely on the quintessential superhuman entities as in any anime with an action genre, also we were left wondering as to how the twiligts and hunters differ, also we were left wondering about their origins, now I don't if there were anything mentioned about them in the manga since I'm yet to go with it. I did mentioned about sex, drugs, vice, corruption, crime and violence.......each character in this anime were made to represent each term like:\\n\\n\r\nSex:\\n\\n\r\nAlex Benedetto as a helpless whore represent Sex and so as Ginger since we did see him sleeping beside Gina Paulkleen.\\n\\n\r\nDrugs:\\n\\n\r\nOne thing come to mind, and yes it Nicolas Brown, twilights, Loretta and Doc Theo, thought not portrayed as a junkies and drug dealers, they basically represent as realistic junkies and drug dealers.\\n\\n\r\nCorruption:\\n\\n\r\nAnd yes them cops led by Chad.\\n\\n\r\nVice: \\n\\n\r\nThat would be Worick, since we always see him smoking like a chimney, and a typical playboy.\\n\\n\r\nCrime:\\n\\n\r\nThat would be them Mafia bosses and Guild leaders.\\n\\n\r\nViolence:\\n\\n\r\nWho else but them hunters.\\n\\n\r\nOne more reason why I can't give this category a high score was that we're left in a cliffhanger as to what happens next to Worick after duking out with one of them hunters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (up)\\n\\n\r\nI 'd say it was good, since I do find such dark action as unique and that all I can say........\\n\\n\r\nOverall (up)\\n\\n\r\nWe're basically left with a cliffhanger,it maybe enjoyable, but at this point it's rather vague if there will be a season 2 or will original creator Kohske and anime writer Shinichi Inotsume would leave it as an manga, well let's hope that there will be a season 2, so for now I've decided to rank this anime as a \"FAIR.\"\\n\\n\r\nPEACE ESSES \\n\\n\\n\\n",

The opening was awesome, the characters were all dynamic and intense, the world itself was full of darkness and filth.  This anime had everything going for it, but then the last episode hit and it all crashed and burned...\r\nSo, Gangsta is an anime giving you a story full of prostitution, death, and slavery, so if you want something with a happy ending or even a slim silver lining, don't even bother.  Gangsta is not that type of anime.  I loved all the dark elements to Gangsta.  I loved thatthe characters all had dark pasts and futures devoid of any hope for themselves.  It all just fit together so nicely.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself begins with Worick and Nicolas, the Handyman, hired for the dirty jobs no one else can take on.  We follow their lives and complicated relationship while learning more about this screwed up world.  The story gives you many unique characters and tidbits of their complicated pasts, so you remain hooked as the story continues to slowly spiral into more chaos and violence, but then it ends.  And the ending is so controversial I can see why some reviews are so low.  \\n\\n\r\nI am honestly so disappointed in the ending they gave, but I still recommend this anime for the sole purpose that it was refreshing with the characters and the story.  Just beware of an unsatisfying ending...and maybe hope a second season will show up to fill the gigantic hole the anime left.",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nGangsta. makes me, naturally, think of the word \u201cgangster\u201d. I am not a gangster myself, much to the surprise of everyone who knows me. To be honest, I am not sure where that line is drawn. I like mathematics, but that does not mean a gangster cannot like derivatives and integrals, too. The opposite it true as well; I might not do hard drugs but I certainly love caffeine.\r\nI was in a gang once, though not the gruff, cool type. Our gang was called \u201cThe Five Musketeers\u201d. It was me and my four best friends inelementary school. We did everything together, from group projects to field trips to recess. Where one of us was found the other four were surely somewhere close by. We had each other\u2019s backs at all times.\\n\\n\r\nWhile The Five Musketeers does not outwardly compare to Gangsta.\u2019s portrayal of gangsters, inwardly there is an implicit comparison. A \u201cgang\u201d is not hastily strewn together. A gang is a group of people with common interests and, most importantly, mutual understanding of the others in the group. And in this anime, understanding plays a pivotal role throughout, gangster or no.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nWhile The Five Musketeers are replaced by Nicolas and Worick, Gangsta (dropping the period from here on out for sanity and grammar reasons) is all about the seedier side of life. Guns. Drugs. Women. The anime injects its own fantastical aspect in the form of \u201cTwilights\u201d, but the anime is, at its core, a gritty, gangster gallop.\\n\\n\r\nThe first half of Gangsta focuses mainly on setup, and in order to do so adequately the anime takes its time delving into the past. Doing so puts everything into perspective. Not just the characters, but also the harsh reality of the situation they find themselves in. The past is mired in violence, so for Nicolas, Worick, and Alex, continued violence is normal. Therefore letting the viewer see such harshness \u2013 child abuse, relentless murder, and sexual exploits \u2013 acclimates the audience to these same types of events as they happen in the present. It is subtle and subconscious, but it works. Framing the narrative in a past-and-present dichotomy also lends itself to parallelism. To put it differently, seeing where everyone was compared to where they are now immediately establishes connections. Watching as the conflicts remain unchanged or seeing that Nicolas is still loyal to Worick after all these years speaks volumes about the stage and the actors at play. All of this possible because the anime spent so much time divulging the past.\\n\\n\r\nThematically speaking, the past also holds relevancy. Considering Ergastulum and the conflicts, the past can sometimes be difficult to escape. Indeed, as much as people want to leave the past behind, there is always a part of one\u2019s upbringing that sticks with him or her. Alex experiences this with her hallucinations, as does Worick with his nightmares. Interestingly Nicolas, the man who seems to hardly care about anything, is also affected, his relationship to Veronica something he cannot forget. Gangsta does not stop with just the past, though. The show also dabbles into other important themes. One of the more prominent is the prospect of family and what a \u201cfamily\u201d really means. This obviously includes Worick and his relationship to his father, but Nicolas and his relationship to the mercenaries, Nina and her relationship to Dr. Theo, and Ms. Corsica and her relationship to her gang are further examples of the family idea. A theme on what it means to be human is also dabbled with throughout the anime. The Twilights are often considered monsters, but the fear of their insane abilities and horrid backstories skews this definition. Nicolas alone shows how compassionate a \u201cmonster\u201d like him can be \u2013 giving Alex a handkerchief to clean herself up or playing with Nina proves he is not the heartless beast that the world sees him and other Twilights as being.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cDabble\u201d was used both for the family and for the human themes because the anime does not outright explore these motifs. They are there but to call them ideas that were properly investigated is not entirely fair. This is mostly due to the second half of the show; the second half of Gangsta takes an arguably weaker approach. Revealing bits of the past, like Alex\u2019s jumbled memories and Delico\u2019s early upbringing, still exists but is not as important and not as prevalent. Instead, the anime shifts its attention away from the Handymen and towards the expansion of its narrative. It is at this point that the biggest problem of the show begins.\\n\\n\r\nGangsta has a penchant for adding plotlines to its narrative. This sounds quite nice on paper; more plotlines means more action, more action means more character interactions, more character interactions means more captivation. Multiple plotlines induces complexity since each individual plotline involves its own set of events while also overlapping with the other plotlines that are happening concurrently. Gangsta\u2019s problem, though, is that these plotlines never end.\\n\\n\r\nA plotline ideally wants to wrap up in a concise manner. Character arcs finish, events logically play out, and a (relatively) satisfying conclusion is reached. That does not always happen, especially when it comes to narratives that have way too much going on. Under these circumstances, the plotlines are either rushed or left far too open, both options leading to botched arcs and unexplored ideas. Gangsta settles arguably on the better of the two routes. The plotlines of the anime are diverse and many: the cops, Monroe\u2019s attacks, the new hunters, Nico and Worick and Alex, Delico and his sister Erica, Marco and his bride-to-be Connie, Alex and her younger brother and her past, Nina and Dr. Theo, and so on. That is a lot of plot, and for Gangsta twelve episodes was not enough. So rather than even trying to put a bow on the package Gangsta simply shipped an unclosed box. This method is the better of the two because the anime, at the minimum, is doing justice to what has happened instead of creating a false conclusion that ruins what came before.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, this is a problem. Gangsta not ending its tale and instead leaving literally every plotline up in the air eliminates all satisfaction since none was given. The audience is left pondering what happened to Worick, if Alex and Nicolas really ever did cross paths before, and how Marco will save his fianc\u00e9e. This is not imagining where these characters will go, as if the audience is free to interpret future scenarios. There are clear paths the events are designed to head down before reaching this point of daydreaming. This outcome can be blamed on a variety of issues, from the lack of time to poor organization, but regardless leaving the anime as inconclusive as Gangsta did is not conducive to a strong narrative.\\n\\n\r\nLuckily the plotlines are not cumbersome in their presentation despite how many are running simultaneously. The reason is the dialogue. Explicit explanations are rarely used within Gangsta, passing comments the only insight into the world. The \u201cFour Fathers\u201d, the Twilights\u2019 \u201ccompensation\u201d, and the ranking system are all pieces to the puzzle, a puzzle that the viewer constructs while watching as opposed to having the whole picture painted for him or her. Keeping the dialogue away from the silver platter and more on the \u201cshow; don\u2019t tell\u201d mentality allows the anime to thrive. The action happening on-screen takes precedence as opposed to outright informing the audience about what is unfolding. This also has the added benefit of making the dialogue feel more natural, further heightening the faux naturalness of the unnatural Ergastulum.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately for Gangsta, a lot of problems in its art and its animation persist throughout the season. Most notably is the actual animation which is sorely lacking. Animation reaches a high point during the fight between Nicolas and Doug during the middle of the season. Otherwise, the anime is filled with many shots of characters standing still and not doing much of anything. Even then the bare minimum is used, mouth movements the only consistent use of animation. That is, despite all of the guns, the swords, and the fists, Gangsta rarely goes out of its way to animate the parts on-screen.\\n\\n\r\nThe art fares slightly better, mostly when it comes to the backgrounds. Ergastulum is heavily influenced by Florence, alleyways and markets aplenty. The buildings, too, are of Florence design, the small windows, the side-by-side-ness, and the colors teleporting the audience to a new yet familiar locale. While the buildings and the areas visited tend to repeat, repetition of this kind fits snuggly within the confines of the show because of how much it adds to the everyday feeling. Again, the gangster lifestyle permeates the characters\u2019 lives, so having the same sense of \u201cseen this before\u201d existing within the show (the art) has the weird side effect of symbolizing that same, repetitive feeling. Simultaneously, the majority of the show takes place in the smaller, often seedier areas, furthering the evil vibe Ergastulum gives off.\\n\\n\r\nBesides the backgrounds are the other nuances, such as the camera and the lighting. Camera-wise, Gangsta can get tricky, especially when the camera is used to provide a first-person perspective from Alex\u2019s or Worick\u2019s point-of-view. Lighting does not follow suit, although the dullness of the mood can arguably be attributed to the feeling Ergastulum exudes: danger and despair.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the character designs, despair gives way to hope. The designs are sometimes subtle, such as Nicolas\u2019s thinner eyes representing his Japanese heritage or Alex\u2019s initial white dress symbolizing the purity she still holds despite how impure she might be now. Other features of the designs are loud, like Worick\u2019s eyepatch existing as a constant reminder of the past and Dr. Theo\u2019s missing fingers evidence for the amount of labor he has undergone. There is also an air of maturity about the characters (excluding Nina and Doug). Hair on their hands, the rough contours and scars on their faces, and their tired, baggy eyes markedly increase the age of the cast, aligning with the more mature tale at hand. And one would be remiss if their actual outfits were ignored; suits, button-up shirts, and stylish attire are rampant, fitting the period, the place, and the part well.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nGangsta is filled from top to bottom with a host of characters. Some are one-offs like Galahad and others are a bit more prevalent yet still just outside the realm of relativity like old lady Joel. The ones who garner the most attention, though, are Nicolas, Worick, and Alex. And rightfully so, considering their main character status.\\n\\n\r\nNicolas grew up (essentially) without a father. He grew up with no respect. He grew up indoctrinated, believing himself to be nothing more than a tool, a monster, a fiend. For Nicolas, that was enough. Getting the drug for his body and fighting in battles was all he needed to keep going. This is all assumed, of course; the audience does not witness his life before arriving at the Worick household. But based on his treatment at the hands of the soldiers and the rumors about his genetic kind, it is not an unimaginable stretch to think that Nicolas\u2019s life before meeting the prim and proper boy was filled with turmoil. His life starts to improve (however slightly) when Worick enters the picture.\\n\\n\r\nWorick is coincidentally similar to Nicolas. Worick had a troubling childhood at the hands of an abusive father. The only comfort Worick had was in the books he would read, but even then his super-human memorization and reading abilities made this more an aside rather than a retreat. This combination made him into a smart kid; Worick was not ignorant of the world around him. However he gets a reality check when Nicolas appears. He sees first-hand what Twilights are capable of, how Twilights act, and who Twilights really are. Worick quickly realizes, though, that Twilights, and more specifically Nicolas, are not that different from himself. In this case, Worick empathizes with the young boy. They both experience physical and emotional pain that ultimately creates the friendly relationship they establish. That is to say, for the first time, Worick and Nicolas have someone they can confide in: each other.\\n\\n\r\nAnd this is what is shown. Nicolas relies on Worick to teach him how to write, to communicate, and to live. Worick, in contrast, relies on Nicolas for moral support. The climax of their relationship occurs when Worick orders Nicolas to kill his family, but that moment, while violent, also highlights how they help the other. Afterwards Worick and Nicolas essentially go rogue, supporting themselves for the most part. At this point, they have already gone through trauma and subsequently development. This is why the season hardly had any growth for Worick and Nicolas in their current age because Gangsta was more preoccupied showcasing how the men got to where they were. How Worick\u2019s free-spirited nature stems from the freedom he finally had on his own, how Nicolas\u2019s utter loyalty derives from Worick being the only person who ever truly cared for him. They are what are known as \u201cbest friends\u201d. For them, their connection is a perfect match. Worick the brains and Nicolas the brawn. Worick the eyes and Nicolas the ears. Worick the gigolo and Nicolas the \u201cTag\u201d. They are a duo destiny designed. They are clearly two halves to a whole.\\n\\n\r\nBut a third half unexpectedly emerges in the form of a young woman named Alex. When the audience first sees Alex, not much thought is given towards her. She is \u201cjust another prostitute\u201d, applicable doubly so because of the city she finds herself in. But soon it is revealed that she is a struggling soul. She wrestles with demons, both internal and external to herself. It is not until Worick intervenes that Alex makes that first step forward: shooting Barry\u2019s mangled corpse as a means to release all of her built-up frustration. All of this is within the first episode. The show makes her dire need of help evident, and through Nicolas and Worick\u2019s aid, she finally finds the home she had always been searching for.\\n\\n\r\nAlex soon discovers that, like the narrative portrays, the past is not always easy to overcome. Her hallucinations, her fixations, and her fascinations are psychologically induced. Despite Nicolas and Worick inviting her to their abode, despite leaving her old life behind, despite learning more about things she never knew, she is still fighting herself. Dr. Theo is the first to notice, and his work should not be forgotten, but it is thanks to Worick\u2019s quick thinking head (both literally and figuratively) that Alex is ultimately saved. This makes sense on a symbolic level. Alex\u2019s mind was in chaos, so it took a completely sane and intelligent one to get her to recover. This also makes sense on an interpersonal level. Alex is someone who has never really known compassion let alone amicable relationships. Thus, getting into her head that she is a changed person, that she is a woman who can finally feel safe, required another head to make that happen.\\n\\n\r\nHer relationship with Worick \u2013 as well as her relationship with Nicolas \u2013 begs a question: how does she, Alex, the third half, fit into this whole? She is not a socializing wizard like Worick is, nor is she an all-powerful, sword-swinging fighter like Nicolas is. Compared to them she seems useless. Compared to most people, she seems useless. Nina is a nurse, Ms. Cristiano leads one of the most influential families in the city, Connie runs a weapons store, and so on. Alex does not \u2013 cannot \u2013 do much of anything. Therefore Alex occupies the most unique role in the anime: Alex is the norm. Alex does a lot of listening and a lot of thinking. She answers the phones for the Handymen and she comforted Worick when he had a nightmare, and later on she is shown to have the makings of a singer. But for the vast majority of Gangsta, Alex is the most normal of \u201cnormals\u201d. She barely stands out from the myriad of interesting people around her, granting her that outside perspective. Hence, in a clever move, Alex is the audience. She witnesses the brutality, the racism, and the people of Ergastulum, meaning she is the lens that the viewer uses to see the given world for what it is.\\n\\n\r\nAlex does more than mirror the audience. Alex also mirrors Nicolas and Worick. Like the two men, her past is filled with pain of all different kinds. Pain whose scars do not subside. Still, she tries to understand Nicolas and she tries to help Worick, just as Nicolas and Worick have always done for one another. But it is more than simply reflecting the way Nicolas and Worick lookout for each other. For all three, they have something in their lives that is simultaneously helpful and harmful. Worick has impossible memorization skills, but that is both a blessing and a curse. Nicolas has insane combat abilities, but that is both a blessing and a curse. So what of Alex? For her, Worick and Nicolas are both a blessing and a curse. They saved her. The perfect match gave her a chance when nobody else would. Yet they also brought her into some of the most dangerous set of events imaginable. Indeed, Alex is warned time and again that staying with them, let alone in Ergastulum, will spell her doom.\\n\\n\r\nDue to the narrative stopping itself prematurely, this doom is never actually shown. It seems like it is heading down that path, considering the numerous amounts of conflict occurring at the same time when the story \u201cconcludes\u201d. This all says nothing of Alex\u2019s recollection of her brother and her probable past with Nicolas. The audience unfortunately does not get to see the full extent of Alex\u2019s \u2013 and Worick\u2019s and Nicolas\u2019s \u2013 character arcs. However for what was given and where the anime managed to get to, the gigolo, Tag, and prostitute are more than poised for further development down the road.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe original soundtrack is so awesome that it has to be talked about first. No matter what someone might think about the story and its characters, Gangsta makes it very difficult to deny how amazing its OST is. The tracks are first and foremost entirely mood setting. Slow jazz ensembles ooze coolness. Snapping fingers and clapping hands are both catchy and fitting. Hard beats push the atmosphere into hardcore territory. The sounds engross the audience, transposing them from their own world to the world of Ergastulum, thereby turning the show into an experience rather than simply something to watch. Ambient effects are simultaneously alien and comforting, coinciding with the anime\u2019s own feeling. Snare drums punctuate the normalcy of the happenings in the city. And haunting choir compositions capture the depressing reality of the situation everyone finds themselves in. The OST is nothing short of music juggernaut.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the OST is hands-down the best aspect of Gangsta, the voice acting, the opening theme, and the ending theme are likewise strong in their construction. Starting with the voice acting, the performances provided are often executed well. Most notably is Kenjirou Tsuda as Nicolas. His speaking voice, strained and garbled, adds another dimension to the deaf man. Junichi Suwabe as Worick also lends a nice voice, his suave and teasing way of talking turning him into the most lighthearted person in the city. Mamiko Noto as Alex also deserves a shout-out, her tired voice reflecting not just the difficult life she has lead but also the difficult life anyone leads in this crazy place.\\n\\n\r\nLast but not least are the OP and the ED. The OP is echoing, electrifying, and engaging. The beat is instantly catchy, the strange sounds and high-pitched \u201csinging\u201d inviting the listener to prepare themselves for what the anime is about to dish out. In the middle the piece transitions to a loftier tone, but that matches the aspirations of the characters involved; Ergastulum might be a harrowing city to live in but everyone still has people and dreams worth fighting for. And while the final lyric might ask one to \u201cpeace out\u201d, the whole piece makes it hard to follow such an order.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the ED, it takes a dichotomous approach. The pace slows down considerably, the female vocalist showing nice range and giving soft singing that balances the usual craziness witnessed minutes prior. And rather than funky sounds, the ED relies more on regular instruments like the guitar and the piano to get across a completely calm composition. Interestingly, the contrast between the OP and the ED symbolizes the medication that the Twilights take: the uppers and the downers. The OP pumps one\u2019s adrenaline whereas the ED soothes one\u2019s mind, as if the audience is meant to be treated as a Tag. Given the addictive qualities of the opening and ending themes, interpreting them as drugs is not that far from the truth.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nThere is an extremely small moment in the season that captures what this anime is all about.\\n\\n\r\nNicolas is in bed after his altercation with Doug and after the downers were shot into his body. Worick asks Nina how she could have heard him (Worick) coming for help, considering the heavy downpour of rain. In response, Nina does not immediately answer. Instead, she burns her lips on the coffee she was drinking as she fumbles at the embarrassing question. The anime did not have to have this slight stumble; Nina could have simply said outright why. But by her being unable to process what was just said, followed by her messing up, reflects the events of the anime. There are numerous instances where misunderstanding leads to horrible conclusions: the racism towards the Twilights, Worick missing Alex\u2019s troubled signals, Doug trying to take out \u201cGunslinger Danny\u201d, and so on. Of course, Nina\u2019s brief clumsiness is cute, funny, and telling of her relationship with Worick (that much is undeniable) but that moment is relatable. Natural. Pure. And collectively, that moment symbolizes just another day in Ergastulum.\\n\\n\r\nBesides doctor visits and coffee, the anime also manages to include other lighthearted scenes. Nicolas playing with Nina\u2019s cheeks shows how kind the relationship between them is. Connie feeling up Alex\u2019s breasts to determine if they are real or not is funny, especially when the art changes into a more comedic form. Ms. Cristiano\u2019s reaction after Galahad slammed his hand on the table after the clearly evil Four Father was discourteous towards her was adorable. These scenes are accentuated due to the melancholic atmosphere that Ergastulum, the characters, and the anime emphasize at all times. So, again, while these moments are largely insignificant to the proceedings of the show \u2013 and even more important, insignificant to its purpose \u2013 having them around humanizes the nonhuman experience. This is not a startling contrast or even a necessary one, but having the contrast around improves the anime\u2019s impact when all is said and done.\\n\\n\r\nComedy aside, I was impressed by the first half of the anime. Seeing Nicolas and Worick\u2019s background through flashbacks, worrying about Alex\u2019s transition from squalor to safety, and learning about Ergastulum through the minor details of the dialogue crafted a promising start to the anime. After Alex overcomes (for the most part) her psychological issues, and the anime starts to continually add more and more to its narrative without properly concluding any part of it, is when the entertainment starts to dwindle. This is for a variety of reasons, the biggest being the focus shifting away from Worick and Nicolas and to Ms. Corsica, Delico, and Marco. Alex is still around \u2013 it was nice to see her finally catch a break for once with her solo \u2013 but the minor characters clearly take over the direction of the anime. This is possibly due to both Worick and Nicolas somewhat stagnating as characters since they do not have a personal conflict occurring as the multiple set of events start to unfold, but displacing them as much as the show did in the second half was not something I was in favor of.\\n\\n\r\nI was also not a fan of Mikhail, one of the Tag killers. Erica was fine because of the relationship she has to the other characters, specifically her brother Delico. Mikhail, on the other hand, was downright annoying. He is supposed to be creepy since he is a child who is obsessed with murder, but because his background as a villain was little more than \u201ckilling is fun\u201d I found him lame rather than scary. Another aspect of the anime that perturbed me was Doug\u2019s death. The anime put a lot of emphasis on his character, going so far as to establish a relationship between him and Nicolas. So when the show did choose to kill him off, I found the move questionable. Even worse was the manner in which he was killed. The point was probably to demonstrate just how strong the incoming, \u201cTag 2.0\u201d bad-guys were since one of them took Doug out with one swipe. But I could not help but feel that they could have treated his character a bit better than they did.\\n\\n\r\nGangsta. (bringing back the period) has a lot going for it. The incredible sound-work, the interconnected characters, and the setting of Ergastulum are all aspects of the anime worthy of praise. At the same time, the show has a lot going against it. The tightly-packed yet unfinished narrative, the lousy animation, and the questionable choices in the latter half of the anime are all aspects unworthy of that previous praise. However the positives slightly outweigh the negatives, and while The Five Musketeers is a gang that no longer exists, if the gang was around it would definitely see this one as an interesting venture.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fine, a strong first half gives way to a mediocre second half due to adding plotlines that the narrative never concludes, with themes on the past, family, and humanizing that vary in exploration\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Fine, below average actual animation, okay art direction, nice character designs\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, Nicolas and Worick share a strong relationship, Alex is even stronger as a character, and the three together make for an interesting and interconnected gang\\n\\n\r\nSound: Great, good OP, good ED, fantastic OST, above average VA performances\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Fine, symbolic moments and fun scenes are interspersed, but entertainment dwindles the further along the season progresses\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 6/10",

            "content": "I actually went in to \"Gangsta.\" with low or almost non-exciting expectations, but it turned out that I quite liked it - a lot. I have not read the manga, so I can\u00b4t say if the adaptation is good or not but after this I will for shore pick it up. It\u00b4s clear that it\u00b4s a build up to a second season, with this season ending with some major cliffhangers and no rounding up of the story. You will probably know just from the title, synopsis, genres and opening if \"Gangsta.\" is your cup of tea or not. It\u00b4s quite a give away of theshows content. Why did I like it? I will get down to that know.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\r\nThe story isn\u00b4t anything unique or world changing, but I find the story enjoyable. It\u00b4s a mature type of story and story telling and the cast isn\u00b4t in their teens, but grown ups who seem a lot of shit in their 30\u00b4s. The set up is a fictional city ruled by four gangster families, the police force and the government. Unlike our world the gangster families actually is a solid and appreciated society foundation. They have different fields of operations, and are collaborating to have some kind of civil order. When put like that it\u00b4s sounds like it\u00b4s kind of peaceful, but of course it\u00b4s not. The city is full of low lives, murderers, rapists, prostitutes, mercenary\u00b4s, corruption and genetically   altered super humans. The super humans are called \"tags\" or \"twilight's\", and they possess intensified speed, strength, smell, eye sight and so on. They have tags around their necks (there of the nickname \"tags\") with their name and rank - the rank tells how strong they are (of course). They are feared, hated and/or looked down on by most of the society. The \"tags\" are contracted to \"normal's\" as they call it, and they are dependent on specific drugs to survive. 22 years prior to the show, a anti \"tag\" organization and rebellion occurred and the tolerance between pro tags and no tags are still very fragile. This lay way for a all out war at any time. I like premises like this in a story, it\u00b4s easy to build on and can cover multiple subjects at once. The plot is simple enough in it\u00b4s base, but can come out confusing - but the trick is to follow the connection between all of the characters and organizations (and believe me it\u00b4s quite a few).  In all this we get some normal life to life aspects of the characters as well - I enjoyed does really much. It\u00b4s seinen so it\u00b4s a lot of nudity, violence and blood (clue: title Gangsta). The show contains a lot of dialogue - everything from your every day to day talk, to business,  to more heavy subjects. I think it gave the show a more life like atmosphere. It\u00b4s very few comical moments in this piece, but the few that\u00b4s accruing is actually pretty funny. An extra good point that should be praised is the visualization of Nicolas and Woricks past. It wasn\u00b4t a whole episode dedicated to it, but you got to know it in some smaller bits and pieces here and there throughout the whole show. It didn\u00b4t take away the attention from the story line, it was used in a manor of getting to know them and their current person at the right times - nicely done in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThe first word that comes to mined is - suiting atmosphere. The art and animation is quite good, nothing flashy - but good. The thing they have managed to do is creating a very suitable atmosphere to the plot and it\u00b4s characters. It\u00b4s not bright and shiny, but it isn\u00b4t all dark and hell either - the color panel is spot on. Backgrounds are nicely displayed with personal and environmental details. I liked it a lot. I\u00b4m really a fan of the character designs, they are a bit ruff - as they should be in a show with the title \"Gangsta\". All characters have personal traits and features that makes them easy to recognize. And some was a totally new visual experience for me - like Nicolas character design, which I grow very found of. The action scenes are in my opinion quite good - not the best I seen but really enjoyable. Fluid motions, pretty nice angles and well displayed techniques. The gun scenes was pretty damn good as well. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nThe soundtrack isn\u00b4t anything I\u00b4m personally is a fan of but again, suiting for the show\u00b4s atmosphere. We get some jazz influences, some more hard core music and some times even a bit sweet music. I think that in most cases the music fitted the scene and helped create the atmosphere and emotions it was intended for. The OP was actually a very up beat funky pop song. But it fitted the visuals and wasn\u00b4t bad at all - I quite enjoyed it. The ED was a slower guitar and piano piece - nothing memorable but not bad either. Overall the sound effects was very good, nothing to complain about from my end. The VA\u00b4s (I watched the dubbed), did their job very well in my opinion. If you have watched your fare share of dubbed anime you will recognize several of them. A bit surprisingly is that the voice actor of Nicolas (who is deaf) was my favorite. He did a great job of portraying the slightly muffled speech that deaf people can have.   \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nThe characters was the main thing that really made me enjoy \"Gangsta.\" so much as I did. They came out as very human to me. They are flawed and marked buy their past, just like you and me. It\u00b4s quite a lot of characters involved in the plot, so the main focus is of course on out main cast - Nicolas, Worick and Alex. But that didn\u00b4t stop me from starting to feel something for all of the supporting cast. In the end I was like \"please dont let him/her die, it would be really sad if that happened\" - for all of them.  I have seen shows twice it length, and almost felt nothing for the main and supporting characters. So that\u00b4s a pretty damn good job for a only 12 episode show, with a lot of characters in it. \\n\r\nThe show\u00b4s stars is with out a doubt Nicolas and Worick. As a main duo they are excellent. They have great dynamic, interesting personalities, a different way of doing things, and was enjoyable to watch in every situation. They are called the \"Handymen\", due to that they make up the only 2 employees in their mercenary company. They fix all kind of things for pretty much any one - everything to paint a house, to body guarding, to killing people. They have their moral codes and their loyalty\u00b4s, that\u00b4s whats makes them so likable (even if they are cold blooded killers). Worick also has side job as gigaloo, a job he has had since he\u00b4s was 14 (yeah, shock). As i mentioned before Nicolas is deaf, and there for has very few line. So one could think that his person would be hard to distinguish compared to the all the other character but it\u00b4s the opposite. He could be one of the most unique main characters I seen. He\u00b4s lack of lines only makes everything else he does so noticeable. He body language, his facial and eye expressions is very specific and makes him stand out. Cred to the show to have a deaf main character and taking it\u00b4s time to include sign language. The sign language aspects is actually a quite touching part of the show - for example Alex studying and trying to learn it so she can communicate better with him. As far as character development it wasn\u00b4t anything major. The plot, the amount of characters, and the time frame didn\u00b4t allow that. It wasn\u00b4t anything that bothered me at all, it was plenty to just get a hang of the characters personalities and getting to know them. One  that actually was given a bit a development was Alex. She starts out as a very mistreated prostitute with hollow eyes and lack of life lust. After her pimp is killed by Worick and Nicolas (in business not connected to her), she\u00b4s moving in with them and becomes their secretary. It\u00b4s was actually quite touching to see her slowly open up to and trusting them. She\u00b4s starts to see some positive things in her life for the first time in along while. Alex past has given her mental traumas (PSTD), that are hunting her as well at the same time. To see how she had to deal with that was very realistic in my opinion.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nDue to that I went head deep into Gangsta with little to no expectations, I was really happy to find that I enjoyed it so much as I did. I think it\u00b4s was interesting, exciting and even touching. The small gestures of kindness really shined in this other wise pretty dark and ruff story. People actually live in similar environments, and I can absolutely see a realistic connection between the characters and IRL versions of them in their way of reasoning and acting. I\u00b4m definitively hoping for a season 2 and will dig into the manga now.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nDid \"Gangsta\" consist of a fare share of good action? Yes. Did it contain believable and moving drama? Yes. Did it contain blood, gore, violence, sexual allusions and other grown up subjects? Yes. Was it done in a good manor? Yes, mostly. I was never bored, annoyed or to confused. It\u00b4s was overall a good experience and I found some new characters that I really enjoyed. I\u00b4m very curious to how this develop and looking forward to rest.",

            "content": "Crime life was never a warm tasty looking dish, and the streets, well, they are less of correctional cooks working on an old dirty jail pit that a sane person would never call a kitchen. \u201cGangsta.\u201d, takes the idea of post-war conflicts, mafia, and life under drugs, hits, and prostitution, and comes out with an original story focusing on many vital factions that rules the streets with guides harsher and more brutal than the savage life of nature. From the same studio that made the fantastic \u201cSamurai Champloo\u201d, a studio that has recently announced its bankruptcy in the midst of producing \u201cGangsta.\u201d, studio \u201cManglobe\u201d. Anddue to the sudden report, the series gets a lot of hate mainly because of how it ended, but it was never the source material's fault, the stab of bankruptcy was too harsh with the series it left a bad image on most of the fans.\\n\\n\\n\r\n- Story (8.5/10):\\n\r\nErgastalum, a fictional town in some unknown country was once home to war and conflicts, people were raised from their childhood days on the principle of killing and assassination under the influence of a drug called Celebrer that gives the user insane strength, speed, and agility. After the war, descendants of those drug users had the symptoms passed down to them and thus were treated as superhuman individuals recruited from the start to be fine killing machines called the Twighlights, for each a specific rank numbered by Tags like (A/0, D/3, C/5...etc). In the current days, the city is being maintained and ruled by four mafia families, called the four fathers that strive to make Ergastalum a heaven for Twighlights to live in. Enter the Handymen, a duo of super skilled dudes taking a neutral stand in all of that mess that rely on making deals with either the police or the mafias to earn their buck of the day. That is until they befriend a mysteriously lost soul, Alex, a desperate young woman who's found in prostitution a way to guarantee her dinner. The trio gets involved in trouble more than they could handle while keeping up a straight smile, and a conflict that shakes the relationship between the four fathers is started.\\n\r\n\u201cGangsta.\u201d was very specific and yet a bit hard to keep up with for how frequent it switched timelines to explain past events, no episode was slow in pace of focused around uninteresting plot points, it was all a blood thrilling action centered fest that didn't fall short of being as sad and emotional when it needed most.\\n\\n\r\n- Art (9.5/10):\\n\r\nFor me, studio \u201cManglobe\u201d was always a welcoming trusty guy that's always generous in his giving. I've praised \u201cDeadman Wonderland\u201d before for its excellent fluid animation, and here is Gangsta. setting up a new high ceil of their previous works to the top. I'm not a manga reader, but upon comparing both works, the difference in both the author of the manga and the production team's art style was unnoticeable, so loyal to the source material. What I liked the most was how the general anatomy of people was handled, leaning towards a more Italian feel on the faces, a widely known stereotypical group of people that suit the traditional mafia role.\\n\r\nAll of the fighting scenes, the major and the not so important ones were just a splendid form of moving art that you can never get tired of looking at, I could almost move in sync with the hand to hand combat for how immersed I always felt while watching the series. I appreciate the minimalistic CGI usage, one of the rules of thumb of producing flawless animation in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\n- Sound (9.0/10):\\n\r\nI never give much appreciation to the voice acting in most of the shows I watch, but one simple fact let me have some more consideration of this aspect. Nicolas, one of the main character is a deaf dude that uses sign language to communicate, but also can speak some barely understood words, the voice actor's performance on that part was just so believable, you could feel the struggle he puts into pronouncing every word, it never felt forced or unnatural for a deaf person (talking about the SUB head, but I've heard good things about the DUB as well). This fact alone made me pay extra attention to the other characters as well, and there was a massive distinguishment between everyone's way of talking, there is the guy with the confident tone of voice that's only complimented by his tough beastly force, and there's the hesitation and fear in the troubled character's voice, like there was a special aura in the resonance of the sound of their voice. It fills me with chills just remembering some of the big performances.\\n\\n\r\n- Character (8.5/10):\\n\r\nI really appreciate the path they went with here, unlike Baccano! which is an outstanding show by the way, while having as big of a character cast as the latter, it did a slightly better job at keeping up all of the characters in the context of the story. We get to know more about a character than its backstory, which is by the way very sad looking how they were the first generation of the yet still fading off the war. One thing I didn't quite accept was the clich\u00e9 towards linking several characters towards the end, in some cases, I couldn't care less if that was some guy's lost sibling or anything.\\n\r\nYou would think people from the same background would have similar treats, but they weren't similar even by a cellular margin.\\n\\n\r\n- Enjoyment (9/10):\\n\r\nThe has given me a great first impression from episode one, and managed to keep up the quality I anticipated through the series, and for that, I'm most appreciative. At the very least, I added another character to my small collection of favorite-characters-in-anime, and very proud I got to see his greatness on display. I never got any sign of annoyance from any of the characters, the events were going at a considerably semi-fast pace, enough to have me focused on the plot, the animation again was just eye relaxing and kept up the same quality all the way to the end. I never thought I would find something so sad and depressing in a show like that, but I was proven wrong, but in a great way.\\n\\n\r\n- Overall (8.9/10):\\n\r\nI would absolutely recommend this for anyone who's looking on a modern, crime, action show, but before diving in, you'll have to be reading for the partial-nudity, sexual references, violence, gore, adult-language as the show doesn't hold back on that a bit. One other thing, due to the bankruptcy studio Manglobe was faced, the show was left in one of the worse cliffhangers out there, so you'll most likely not get you to share of satisfaction from that kind of ending.",

            "content": "This Anime was really interesting to watch, it captivates you, there's a lot of psychology going on. You get to know the past of the 3 main characters and what shaped them as they are.\r\nYou can see what happens to people that were born in tough neighbourhoods, or even in rich ones (and see that their lives were not so rich or beautiful), and how their friendship is born.\r\nSome say that Alex was a totally useless character, I beg to differ. She represents any women that by circumstances of poverty, orphanity, loneliness, or whatever might happen in someone's life, end up getting exploited by apimp and sent into forced prostitution. Abused/abandoned by her father, It was her only way out to help her little brother. She shows usual signs of trauma that women in her situation present, specially when you see her entering in survival mode (see the episode where she approaches Worick, I won't spoil).\\n\r\nShe also shows a kind, sweet, shy personality, which is how she really is.\\n\\n\r\nWorick and Nic are the typical friends that are more like brothers. They were both alone in the world, with no mothers, and abusive fathers. Constantly beaten and neglected, they created a strong friendship, and eventually helped each other to get out of that abuse. Each have unique personalities, and then there's this amazing fact:\\n\r\nNic is deaf and you get to see sign language (even in the ending song of the Anime) and how a deaf person sounds when they try to speak out loud. This is the first and only time I saw deafness being represented in one Anime. Just that makes this series quite remarkable.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the whole Anime in general, this truly needed to be a 24 or 26 episode show. It was just impossible to develop such complex characters and stories with just 12 episodes. However, the studio that made the Anime went bankrupt, so you have to consider that might be the cause for so much things lacking.\\n\\n\r\n----\\n\\n\r\nThe last (6?) episodes of this show were very confusing and tried to add too much information and new characters, and I think that was a major flaw that completely crippled out  Gangsta. I was expecting to see more of Worick and Ric but they were quite absent in the last episodes, and then you have the final episode which is basically an end...with no end!\\n\r\nYou don't know how the story concludes or what happens to each of the main characters. So the show was very disappointing and bitter in the end. You started to know these characters and love them, and you don't even get to know what happens. So I only advice people to see Gangsta if they don't mind an Anime with no conclusion, it's only good for the  characters story.\\n\\n\r\nI wished the producers could have spent more time developing the plot, making all the bases to make this Anime consistent, doing at least 24 episodes. It would be more than enough to put this together and make it amazing (wish they had at least the funds to do so).\\n\r\nEither way, I enjoyed it for what it is, and would watch again.\\n",

They ruined everything, it didn't even feel like an ending at all. I really wish they make a second season because I don't understand, it can't just end like that!

            "content": "Gangsta follows in the footsteps of titles like Black Lagoon and Jormungand in exploring characters involved in the criminal underworld, this particular series focusing on our main pair of Worick and Nicolas serving as \"Handymen\" who are paid to handle jobs for both crime families and the police. For a 12 episode series, Gangsta goes into quite a bit of exploration on the criminal world within the fictional city of Ergastalum and the characters living in it as the series delves into how a number of the characters within the city are affected by the regular criminal activity and the influential criminal families that governit. From former prostitute Alex trying to get over her former life and recovering from drug addiction to Christiano crime boss Loretta handling the pressures of being a mob boss for her young age, the series offers a great deal of depth on exploring its fairly large cast and the amount of influence that each of the four crime families in Ergastalum have.\\n\\n\r\nA major element of the series involves Twilights, humans who gained superhuman attributes through taking drugs and genetically inheriting the abilities from their parents with Nicolas being one of them. The affairs of Twilights within Ergastalum are influenced by the crime families in the city who have differing positions on how to handle them from enforcing rules to keep them under control to desiring to wipe them out due to the concern of them being highly dangerous to non-Twilight members of the city populace. The presence of Twilights influence two major plot elements in the series. The first being Worick and Nicolas' relationship as the two have known each other since childhood and dealt with a rather abusive past they shared together, with Worick often having to keep Nicolas in line to keep him from getting in a frenzy during fights and overdosing on drugs. The second story element involves a group of Twilight murderers who make their presence felt in Gangsta's second half as their murder spree shakes up the rule of the crime families as these murderers are disrupting the rules set in place for Twilights. While the Twilight murderers help to create more suspense and exploration of how the crime families influence the Twilights within the city, this ongoing plot lacks a resolution as Gangsta ends rather abruptly during some major developments within the storyline that take place in its final episode. \\n\\n\r\nVisually, Gangsta is among one of the better-looking titles animated for 2015 thus far featuring highly detailed scenic shots of the Ergastalum city landscape with subdued color tones that help to compliment the show's dark and violent setting. Character designs are drawn with realistic details in mind to give the show a lifelike feel and action scenes are nicely animated with fluid movement being on regular display throughout the show's run as it shows off sequences such as gun fights, Twilights leaping up to rooftops and swordplay in action from Twilights like Nicolas. \\n\\n\r\nIn spite of its inconclusive ending, Gangsta is still easily among one of the best titles airing this year with its excellent storytelling and characterization with exploring the lives of those living in and surviving the crime-infested streets of Ergastalum. This is a definite recommendation if you've enjoyed seeing titles like Black Lagoon and Jormungand that focus on characters involved in the criminal underworld.",

            "content": "I'll keep this review short and sweet for those who don't want to read a massively worded review.    Gangsta, is a show about 2 guys who live in a tightly packed town where there are people who have skills in fighting, and war is a constant event that happens due to people from different sections of the town being at odds with each other.   Thats just the basics.\r\nNow, the first thing that can be seen is that the art style, and the story (very loosely) is similar to Black Lagoon, which is a series that I really really enjoyed.So, why am I not giving this show a higher rating?    Simple, because the story did not progress much.   The plot would constantly pause and lots of 'memories' and past events would play through, and certain characters were introduced, but nothing much would come from it.  It felt like it was building up for something big to happen, yet nothing big happened.  Major let down.     Besides that, the characters were fairly interesting.  Each one had something interesting going on, even though the constant use of eye patches was overly done.    The sounds/music was good, it really was.  Animation style, started off great, then started to slacken near the end of the season.   Maybe budget issues?\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, the show itself, was okay, just, okay.  Not bad, but not amazingly superbly great either.   The art style made me like it because of the Black Lagoon style, the characters made things gritty, but the story progression, was really lacking.",

            "content": "Welcome to Ergastulum, a city crawling with criminals and outcasts. Hiding in the alleyways are people known as Twilights, victims of a drug called cerebre. Twilights are individuals who have either used cerebre or whose parents used cerebre, and as a result, their physical abilities are enhanced but their lifespan is severely shortened. Nicolas Brown is one a deaf Twilight, who works together with a man named Worick Arcangelo. They call themselves Handymen, and handle odd jobs ranging from fixing up buildings to killing people.\r\nGangsta is a breath of fresh air from all the moe, the monotonous try-hard comedy, and the excessively melodramatic series wesee all too often in the anime industry. It has characters who have suffered immensely--no, not because of some supernatural phenomenon or a freak accident, but because of things that happen every day to real people. Gangsta, while exaggerating how bad things can get in one city, addresses multiple horrible atrocities that happen to people every single day in real life, including rape, physical abuse, abandonment, drug abuse, forced prostitution, racism, and discrimination. It's rare for any form of media, much less anime, to address all these issues without sugar-coating them or offering a half-assed solution. \\n\\n\r\nGangsta gets off to a great start. The OP is great both audibly and visually. The first episode introduces our main characters, Nicolas, Worick and Alex, all of whom are unique and complex. We see what they do, we see their relationship. We appreciate the friendship between Nicolas and Worick. We sympathize with Alex, who suffers from PTSD. And even though they kill for money or sell themselves, we can see that they're not necessarily bad people. They're just trying to find whatever happiness may exist in this god-forsaken city.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, despite the great characters and awesome OP, most episodes move at a very slow pace. There is plenty going on, as I know from reading the manga, but somehow the anime does a bad job of getting it across. After the first couple episodes, it feels as if nothing significant happens until the last few minutes of each episode. I appreciate the flashbacks to our main characters' pasts; their pasts are so tragic, and they do a great job of endearing the characters to the viewers. Unfortunately though, the present is not nearly as engaging. For the most part, villains come and go without even getting to prove themselves. While there are so many things going on, the hints are subtle, and the anime fails to convey these hints well. The pace of the anime, despite starting off fast, slows to a crawl. \\n\\n\r\nI believe the main reason the pacing feels so slow is because of the soundtrack. While I can guarantee the laid-back soundtrack will be nice to listen to outside of the anime, it often doesn't complement the anime's mood well. Even fight scenes have the same slow jazz music in the background, so the fights feel anti-climactic. The OST works well in episode 8 when Alex sings, but overall it does a horrible job bringing out the show's intensity. A perfect example is the death scene in episode 11--that scene should have been accompanied by really sad music. A sad violin or cello solo would have been perfect for this scene, and yet we got the same snapping beat we always get.\\n\\n\r\nWhile soundtrack is a huge issue for this anime, there's an even bigger problem. Gangsta is the perfect example of an anime that failed because of its awful animation. Whether due simply to low funding or inexperienced animators, or perhaps a combination of both, the animation and art in Gangsta suffered greatly. Even the still drawings of characters are inconsistent, and the fight scenes are horribly animated. The low visual quality of this anime detracted a lot from viewers' experience, and only exacerbated the already slow pace. \\n\\n\r\nIt pretty much goes without saying that Gangsta's ending was unsatisfying. I actually had to make sure Episode 12 was the last episode, because it certainly didn't feel like it. The producers decided to combine two arcs from the manga (which I will call the Monroe Arc and the Connie Arc for simplicity's sake). The manga is currently in the middle of the Connie Arc, having already finished the Monroe Arc. For whatever reason, the anime producers decided to mesh these two arcs together. I believe that was a bad judgment call, as neither arc received proper closure at the end of the series. We never figure out the truth behind Ivan Glasglov (and believe me, it is awful and INTENSE), nor do we ever find out where Connie is and whether she is okay. Those factors, coupled with Worick's state at the end of the episode, culminate in a very unfulfilling end to an unfulfilling anime. \\n\\n\r\nAs with many of the anime this season, Gangsta had a lot of potential. The opening theme and first episode set it up to be the Anime of the Season. Unfortunately, due to a lackluster soundtrack, slow pacing and mediocre animation, it fell short of its potential. That being said, I love the relatable nature and complexity of the characters. I believe the manga does them much more justice. If you liked this anime (or were interested, at the very least), I would strongly recommend checking out the manga. But maybe in a couple months, because it's currently right in the middle of the Connie arc, which is pretty damn painful. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 6 \\n\r\nArt: 4 \\n\r\nSound: 6 \\n\r\nCharacter: 8 \\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6 \\n\r\nOverall score: 6/10 \\n\r\nDo I recommend it?

There were so many points that they were trying to fit in this short 12 episode anime that it became jumbled and unclear.\r\nArt- The art was decent.

            "content": "And that's why they call me \"GANGSTA\"!\r\nSTORY (5):\r\nGangsta is based on a manga by Kohske and produced by Manglobe. Gangsta takes place in Ergastulum, a town where prostitutes, gang activities, mafia and dirty cops roam about. We follow those two protagonists known as Worick & Nicolas who has a duty to prevent crime from being committed into the city.\r\nGangsta the anime did show backstories on the two main characters and why they behave the way they did. I thought that was handled well. I also did like the way how the place Ergastulum is like a low-level society which also highlights the struggles that peopleface when they are in a town where crime rate is high and that there are prostitutes all around. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, the later part of the series became dull and uninteresting as some characters are just there with no flavour to them especially Alex Benedetto. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending of the show just left me with more \"WTF moments\" like what happened to the rest of the cast. Maybe they don't have enough budget to work on the final episode.\\n\\n\r\nART (6):\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was decent. At least there is some movement between the characters.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (7):\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme is addictive especially the relaxing music especially Alex's song in episode 8, I thought it was relaxing. Noto Mamiko voice was beautiful when she sang, reminded me of Asami Imai when she sings.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER (5):\\n\\n\r\nWorick is like the male version of Revy from Black Lagoon. With his badass attitude and his confident look, he really is by far my favourite character in this show. \\n\\n\r\nNicolas talks with his sign language was all right. I also did like his backstory on why he behave the way he did. \\n\\n\r\nAlex Benedetto was very useless as a character. She is just a damsel in distress. She barely contributed anything.\\n\\n\r\nI guess the rest of the characters are bland and forgettable. None of them stood out in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION (5):\\n\\n\r\nI didn't enjoy this anime although I did enjoy few parts like why low-level society isn't a total washout society. Especially the backstory of the main characters. \\n\\n\r\nI just wish they could end on a nice note rather than an anti-climactic ending with no resolution to the characters. It was just wasted potential. For that reason I give Gangsta a 5 out of 10.\\n",

            "content": "Gangsta has an inconclusive cliffhanger ending and will probably never receive a sequel. I think those are the two most important facts about this series. After all, the only thing that can occur when adapting a grim and violent manga is censorship for TV and omission of plot details, so why would you bother? Judged by its own merits, this is a fairly odd series. It's heavily focussed on world-building, establishing just what Ergastulum is and how each character fits into its societal fabric. Much of the key plot points and reveals are simply key facts about the world that you might usually expect tobe explained right off the bat, such as who the Twilights are and why they wear dogtags. The other component is a series of melee fights based off a heirarchy of power levels. For instance, the main character, a deaf Twilight, has a dogtag with A/0 written on it, which means he's rather tough (though there's a bit more to that which I won't spoil.) \\n\\n\r\nAlthough the series has mature themes, the societal problems it tackles are essentially unique to Ergastulum, establishing this as a self-contained fantasy world. This is a series that can only be enjoyed on the strength of its characters and setting - since the story is really rather directionless - but since it spends so much time trying to explain its convoluted premises, there is not much character development in sight. Ultimately it's a confused show that I can't really recommend unless you particularly like its kind of atmosphere.",

            "content": "As a rather recent anime, Gangsta rather quickly got my attention using it's artwork and sound. But, first and foremost, the story.\r\nAs it centers around two main protagonist, from the very start I could see there was a lot of backstory to them and that they trusted each other completely. (Something shown by wearing each others' clothes, usually people who grow up close to each other do that, usually within a family.)\r\nReading the summary there's not much story revealed and it's not immediately revealed in the anime either. I can't say much about it without spoiling, however what I can say is that I can'tprecisely determine when it starts considering it doesn't end by the end of the anime (an ending hated by many, actually). I enjoyed it at least. What I mostly enjoyed about the story telling is the exposition. We're never explicitly told what happened in the world of Gangsta. and the whole time we're learning through second-hand information or just by drawing conclusions that the artists wanted to show us.\\n\\n\r\nTo help tell the story, sound and art interact very nicely. You will notice the art is similar to the one of Shingeki no Kyoujin (thick lines and greyish colors that remain consistent through the story, nothing at all like No Game no Life, which is why it's beautifully reminding us we're present in the world' reality). Unfortunately you can also see the production value drop in a couple of scenes that follow after high-quality animation during fights (that occupy 50% of screentime).\\n\\n\r\nWell, they have to considering our main characters mostly fights with others. Now, what I personally enjoyed the most /are/ the characters. I very rarely saw any characters with visible disabilities in other anime, and if I did they weren't in bad-ass roles like our two main characters (not mentioning Alex's invisible disability and her dealing with it). It's very easy to think her, and most of other characters as realistic portrayals of people and society when there's no building jumping, or axe wielding butchery.\\n\\n\r\n Perhaps it's the representation of people with disabilities, or the different kind of exposition, but I thoroughly enjoyed Gangsta. even with it's ending, which doesn't bother me in the least. Personally, I think that if there were more animes like this there would still be too little of them. \\n\\n\r\nIf you like a good storyline, great characters and blood-pumping scenes with a lot of gore, I think you would like this anime.",

I was not quite impressed with the art, but I still gave the anime a chance due to its explosive hype train. It was quite entertaining at first but after that, everything went downhill.\r\nStory (8/10) -\r\nI'm very conflicted on what rating to give on the story--Gangsta had given me life and at the same time, vexed me to death. The first few episodes didn't disappoint me but as the plot continue thickens, the storyline grew convuluted. Little by little,I lost my interest. It's a pity since the characters were beautifully crafted, and the concept beholds a lot of potential. The trio, Benriya, motivated me to finish this. Actually, I just  watched the last episode and i'm so baffled and upset that i could probably flip a table right now. I could have given it a 9 or a 10 but the ending totally ruined my state of nirvana. I know there is a great possibility of a season 2 but producer-sans, you cannot earn hype with that trivial and horrible ending.\\n\\n\r\nArt (5/10)\\n\r\nTerrible. I am not an expert about anything art-related but the animation is just plain appaling. The action and dramatic scenes were unmistakably appealing BUT the smallest details cannot go unnoticed.

You have one job, Bandai, one job. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (7/10)\\n\r\nI could have given a higher rating if the producers of this anime could have utilized its potential very well.

Worick wears an eye patch from a prior injury, has a photographic memory, and has perfect aim with apistol. He's also a high-end prostitute in his free time. Nico is deaf and part of a sub-class of people who have super human abilities but are reliant on a certain drug to stay alive. His weapon of choice is a sword and he's skilled at reading lips and seeing great distances. Both are over 30 and actually look it (a rarity for a lot of anime).\\n\\n\r\nThe two are assigned to kill everyone involved with a newly formed gang that is disturbing the \"peace\" and involved in drug running and prostitution. While on this job they come across a prostitute, Alex, who works across the street form where they live and whom they have watched be abused for quite some time. They decide to spare her life and she comes to live with them and work as a secretary of sorts (someone needs to answer the phone).\\n\\n\r\nThe next episodes are then full of character development and world building. The first half is well paced but the second half seemed rushed and kind of disorganized. The last 3 episodes came out of nowhere and introduce a lot of new plot concepts with very little explanation. Instead of rushing towards season two I wish they would have spent a little more time on the plot points introduced early on (and saved the hunters for season two entirely). \\n\\n\r\nI also like that the characters are very diverse in age, gender, background, and race. It makes the world more believable and interesting, especially since a lot of different characters get background stories and multiple interactions with the main cast. It's also nice that good and bad aren't always clear cut. Not everything the main characters do is agreeable but it's not done to the point of being antiheroes either. You never really have a clear \"villain\" and the main cast aren't exactly \"heroes\" (though they're certainly likable).\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is both clean and gritty which works well for the story. Music is kind of electro/pop with a touch of teen-angst and is fun to listen to. Opening and ending's visuals are sort of misleading as to the series contents but are catchy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I would recommend this series and would watch it again.",

I enjoyed the backstories to the main characters, they were pretty deep and pretty interesting. Although the show is pretty bad ass, the ending of the show is almost non existent. Without spoiling anything, just imagine any show just being cut off in the middle of the series, that's what happens. The ending was sudden and awkward, but if it get a second season I will be pretty happy for a follow up. Although the show is left with an open ending, the showwas pretty entertaining for what it was and had me interested all throughout the show.",

            "content": "I honestly threw this into my pilot list without looking at it twice. I mean, I like criminal drama, I like single city settings, and throw in a few \"drugged up warrior\" types and I'll bite. What I wasn't sure of is if a 12 episode show could fit it all in, because that's one of the hardest things any show can try.\r\nThe story is fairly simple, two contractors work in the grey areas between crime families, doing jobs that would cause a turf war if anyone else did them. They're hard as nails but smooth as silk - they're designed to be cool andit works pretty nicely. One is a ladies man, the other is a drugged up sword slinger. They rescue a working girl from the streets, and the show follows these 3 characters as they go about their daily \"business\". Fair enough, I'd call that a decent start for setting up characters. What got me to watch All of Gangsta is this: the sword slinger is deaf, and that's represented incredibly well throughout. He can't answer the phone, he can barely speak, there's a lot of sign language...  It's one of the most memorable and well done mechanics in the entire show. The actual dialogue between talking characters is great too.\\n\\n\r\nThe art goes from great initial character design, some wonderful backdrops, and fantastic detail shots that any show would be proud of, to reusing the same shots again and again while the characters get further and further into \"full anime\" mode. C'mon, what's a lollipop sucking scythe wielding super woman doing in a seedy crime town? I found this a little disappointing, because the show starts off so strongly with it's own identity, but loses it as it progresses. I get why though, I mean Manglobe went bankrupt making this (Goodbye season 2).\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is a mix of good and bad, there's a few wonderful pacing tracks and the action sequences feel more tense and thrilling because of this. It's not overly memorable though, even if the opening and closing themes are both pretty good on their own. The voice acting is absolutely gorgeous, especially the deaf character's lines. Heh, wow, never thought I'd say something like that, that sounds pretty dumb.\\n\\n\r\nHalf way through this show, the pacing was quick but not break neck, their was mystery and intrigue about who the villain was, as well as explaining how these \"drugged up warrior people\" function. You've got an opening world and enough to fill it with. The biggest problem this show had was biting off too much at once. It's only 12 episodes and it falls right into my biggest peeve - failing to deal with escalation. This is where all those points start to fall off. By the end of the series, there's enough characters to fill a stadium, all of which don't get enough dialogue or screen time to become actual characters rather than plot devices. Come episode 8ish I think, you can tell that they can't close the loops they've opened, and the finale really lacks any sense of conclusion. I had such high hopes for this show at the beginning, and I'd definitely give season 2 a shot, but right now Gangsta feels a bit like it didn't defrost right before they cooked it. If I'm honest, I'd probably say give this one a skip.",

The dynamic duo of Worick and Nicolas tread the thin grey line between the shifting morals of the city and do so in style.\r\nThe anime has a great host of characters but the only downside being that not all of them get the same amount of attention as the two Handymen do. Sure, they are the protagonists and ergo deserve the most exposition, but it wouldn't hurt toshed some light on the side characters as well, and I say this because the show boasts some of the most interesting and well thought out side characters I've seen recently. \\n\\n\r\nViolence and sexual innuendos are aplenty with great fan service but the standout feature is the combat between the \"Tags\". The powers and abilities of the tags along with their rankings make sense (within the realm of the story) and the balance of power between the Bad guys and the not-so-bad guys is well maintained. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime is highly recommended for those who enjoy good pacing along with Noir gangster elements.",

            "content": "This is my first review, so I'll welcome any constructive feedback.\r\nSTORY:\r\nThe overall setting of the story is in a city known as Ergastalum which is ran by various gangs/mafias, and the police have little control of what goes on. As you can imagine the city is rife with prostitution, drugs, and murder, all the standard stuff for a mafia ran city. If you want a tale that ends in a happy ending with rainbows and glitter then this is certainly not for you. Overall the tone is pretty grim, if you've seen it,(Which I will assume so since both are targeted at very similar audiences)think \"Black Lagoon with superpowers\". The story pacing seems rather good with a good balance on pushing the story forward and character development.\\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\r\nThe art was well done but fairly generic, likewise with the animation. I did enjoy the backgrounds depicting how run down the city was and how the colours were subdued; it was very rare to see a vivid red or blue, with a larger focus on black, brown and grey as standard colours. Visually the character design was solid too, no generic, pink haired, tsunderes. We instead get a great variety of character models, which all vary without being too flamboyent. A little thing I loved regarding the art, is that the weapons used arent so unfathomably outlandish that they couldn't be used, a katana is just that, a set of short swords is just two short swords and nothing else; While this may not mean anything to some people it was just something I liked that they kept things simple here to keep with the tone of the show.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: \\n\r\nSound didn't stand out really, I didn't ever catch myself listening out for the OST. In regards to sound effects, they were solid and even without speaking Japanese myself, I found the voice acting for the deaf character was spot on. The intro was damn good though.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\r\nI spoke earlier in the art section abput the visual character designs, and how they were well varied without seeming outlandish, this is eaqually as true for the characters themselves and their personalities and quirks. I particularly liked how the characters with superpowers (Called 'Twilights' in the anime), are lacking something in exchange for gaining their powers,for example some are deaf, some don't physically age. The reason I brought this up is because so far it has stopped any of those \"I'm going to lose, better power up to SS15/Hyper-Bankai/Mega-demon-fox-mode!\" moments, by giving said characters a handicap in a particular area. Characters that don't posses superpowers aren't left out in terms of development though, with flashbacks showing us that many of them have dark pasts and while I feel that some of the supporting characters could have been developed further it was only a 12EP season, so the overall balance was good and the main characters were developed enough for me to feel invested in.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: \\n\r\nAll in all I feel that 'Gangsta.' was a solid entry to the line up of that season, I had no arguments with it except that there wasn't more of it and I feel that it would have benefitted from having a 24 episode season provided that it was 24EPs of what we had in the first 12. I believe that if you liked Black Lagoon or Jormungand, you'll probably enjoy this series, the story is heading in an interesting direction and should it get a second season you'll definitely have something to look forward to in the future.",

Gangsta deserves to have a sequel, and it's disappointing that it didn't have one.\r\nArt:\r\nThe movement of the characters, the fight sequences, the attention to detail, the quality of the animation, and even the realism that was instilled in the fighting as well as the more silent moments ofthis anime, brought the art to life. You felt the fear of Ergastulum and Tags in general as the story progressed. Furthermore, the realism of the characters as they reacted, also made this a really good anime in terms of art.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nI found the intro and outro of this anime very disappointing. Too loud, and too noisy. And it didn't capture the story in any form or way. Likewise, the music was fair - where the music lacked, the character's voice acting (I saw the Japanese version when writing this review) makes up for it, and the sounds in general (bullets shooting, sword fighting, bombs, etc) were realistic enough, and the hallucinogenic sequences were also spot on. If the music, the intro and the outro had been better developed, I'd have no problems with this series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nNicolas, Warrick, the four families, Constance... I found them to be well developed. But in my opinion it was Warrick and Nicolas who kept my attention focused on the story. Their interaction with each other, and the way they survive in the city itself, followed by their means of survival in the city, make for an interesting watch.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nI can never say no, to action. Especially kick ass Tag fighting. Which here, was a big appeal. The character development also made it a good watch and for me, gave more reasons to watch it till the end. Especially to the cliffhanger last episode anyway.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nA good watch. Crappy Intro, Outro, and Music aside; and taking the cliffhanger ending into consideration, I liked this anime. I see it having the potential of a sequel, but alas, like Shigurui I am starting to believe that they won't do so. Would be nice to see it, in my opinion.",

            "content": "If there was an anime they came during the Spring Season that was hyped, it was this one. This anime had an amazing start, with an interesting setting, characters and story, but where did it just go wrong. (The Video Review is up on my channel, here is the written)\r\nStory - 5/10\r\nNow even though the show is called Gangsta. It is not about boys in the hood type of gangsters, it is closer to the mafia. There a different gangs in the world of Ergastulum, each one with a pretty gritty background. It actually a city built as a quarantine zone. The main story isabout 2 \u2018Handymen\u2019 mercenaries, Nicholas and Worick, who take on odd jobs that the mobs and cops don\u2019t want to handle. Apart from Mobs and Cops, there is a Mercenary group known as Twilights, also known as \u2018Tags.\u2019 What Tags are, are basically people, trained to be Mercenaries with drugs known as Celebrer. These drugs are used to enhance the body, making the consumer almost super human.\\n\\n\r\nOver the course of the story, especially for the first half, we are given a setting and a plot to follow. Basically as the \u2018handymen\u2019 do more jobs, flashbacks of their past are shown more, on how they came to be. Which was really interesting, the history between Nicholas and Worick is the best part of the show. The first half does a fine job of setting up the world, and explains it well. However, the second half is a train wreck. They introduced this interesting world, with many characters and too much story for it to handle. By the end of the series, there was so many stories that were told, and none of them came to a conclusion. I\u2019m am dead serious. There was stories, which didn\u2019t make sense, there were ones that was supposed to link to together, and there were some that was completely boring and did given the shaft. This is disappointing, because it had a really great first half, but then completely lost focus and tried to do too much, and basically made a pointless second half.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThere 2 main characters that make up the \u2018Handymen\u2019 the third I would hardly call a main, considering the treatment she got. \\n\\n\r\nNicholas Brown apart from being a Handymen, he is also a twilight, wielding a katana as he\u2019s weapon of choice. At first he plays the role of a badass gangster wielding a blade in a suit, however as the series progress, he is revealed to be what you not expect. His backstory along with Worick is really interesting on how they met. However his motivation feels lacking, we see who motivates him to do what he does, but we don\u2019t know why. And this a big major negative theme throughout the show. What makes him unique as a protagonist, is that he is deaf, but here has exceptionally strong vision and lip read skills. In a way he is sort of a silent protagonist, because he can\u2019t communicate properly.\\n\\n\r\nWorrick Acangelo is other Handymen, a laid-back member of society, who is just trying to do his job. Unlike most other characters in the show, Worrick doesn\u2019t possess any special abilities. The only thing he does possess that is unique to him is his ability to memorise anything given to him. Worrick has an interesting background, he started from a wealthy background to the a normal into the slums of Ergastulum. Along with Nick,their backgrounds are the most interesting. Unfortunately for him and Nick, they get less screen time during the second half, and almost become secondary characters.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the final supposed main character is Alex Benedetto, a former prostitute turned into secretary of the Handymen. As the story progress she tries to learn more about her new employers and given some development and a backstory, which felt like they were leading somewhere. And she does feel like a character that was just around for some fan-service, there is no other female character in the show that is as sexualised as her. Unfortunately she falls along the lines with many other characters, story and development got a cut short. There is so many characters that have interesting backgrounds and stories, but because there is so many of them, not did none of them get proper development, none of them of them had a concluding story to follow. So all the added characters felt like unnecessary extras.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Sound - 8/10, 8/10\\n\\n\r\nIf there is one thing Gangsta. did right it\u2019s in its presentation. The art style suits the themes perfectly, making it look like everything you want in a crime drama. It\u2019s nitty and gritty and looks awesome. It does a great job at setting up the world, it lets us know that this is nowhere near a peaceful city, it is a city filled with corruption. The animation for the fight scenes are pretty good in my opinion, it is animated well. Unfortunately there is very few of them, and they pass by pretty quick. And most of the character designs look pretty similar, as in their faces look pretty close to each other.\\n\\n\r\nThe ost is really good, especially if its setting up for the atmosphere or complimenting it very well. It\u2019s a great mixture or Hip Hop and Jazz music to suit the modern day criminal underworld setting. There is some electronica in there as well, giving us a good variety to listen to.  There is one particular scene in show, where Alex starts singing some blues, and it\u2019s a really beautiful thing to listen to and it does a great job at setting up for what\u2019s going to happen in the future, because for that moment everything is peaceful. The opening song is pretty epic, the animation is stylish and it\u2019s a really cool song to listen to. The ending song is much slower, even though the art style is the same in the ending as in for the opening, the song is rather forgettable. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nAt the start of the summer season, this was one of my favourite anime of the season. It had such high hopes and it started off well. I was very interested in the story and the invested in the world that they setup, but the slow pacing kind of threw me off a bit, and adding a lot more stories into the mix made it even more confusing. Learning about Nicholas and Worrick\u2019s past are the most enjoyable moments in the show, although its slow, it gives us a good idea on how unfair the real world is and this is the reality of world of Gangsta. Nothing is ever a happy ending. The fight scenes are enjoyable to watch, but there was far too little of them, because dialogue \\n\r\ntook so much time. \\n\\n\r\nVerdict - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nFor the story of Gangsta. I give it a 5. Although the first half was interesting, it was the second half  that really let this series down. They added way too many stories, into such as short amount of time, but what really was the kicker was none of the extra stories were ever completed. Which left to a unsatisfying incomplete ending, with many answers left out.\\n\\n\r\nFor the animation and sound, I give a 8. The animation and art style is really good at setting up a nitty gritty, crime world of an anime. The animation for the fight scenes look good, but there were too few of them. The ost is great, it has many variety of tracks, filled with Hip-Hop, Jazz and Electronica. The op was great, whereas the ending felt underwhelming.  \\n\\n\r\nFor the characters I give it a 6. Only Nick and Worrick get some proper development and loads of screen time for their backgrounds. They have a really interesting background, which make up the best part of the show. However there were way too many characters with backgrounds left out. \\n\\n\r\nFor my personal enjoyment I give it a 7. The first half is what got me hooked onto this anime, just learning about the characters past and enjoying the more mature gritty setting of the anime. After the midway point, it lost focus and my personal enjoyment declined. I legit thought this could\u2019ve been a strong contender for anime of the year.\\n\\n\r\nFor the overall score after rounding it all up, I give Gangsta. a 7/10. Gangsta. is an example of show that started really strong, but then drops heavily around the half way mark. If you\u2019re going to watch this anime I recommend at least the first until episode 7, when we learn about the characters past. I recommend this anime to people are looking for a crime drama and those who are into mobs, and those type of settings. Be wary of the halfway point, know that this not a complete anime. And it doesn\u2019t look like second season will be coming, because Manglobe has shutdown.",

            "content": "POSSIBLE SPOILERS.\r\nThree Laws of Robotics Twilights.\r\nGangster thriller doesn't appear as a typical genre of Japanese animation, because it usually requires a presence of serious drama, realistic depiction, adult characters, and much more.\r\nIn this field you can emphasize shows like Gungrave, Black Lagoon, Jormungand and perhaps that's all. But if the latest was released in 2012 then two previous were released 10 years ago(plus/minus). It seemed that we can put a cross to this genre but a rather well-known studio Manglobe decided to prove the opposite, and released the anime series Gangsta in 2015 - an adaptation of the manga with the same title.\r\nMany people waitedfor the series, because of finally grown heroes, gloomy atmosphere, serious plot and of even more that could have been red about the story on lots of forums. But the show is over and it's time to sum up whether they put up a good show, outdo the other works on this theme or at least did not strike the mud with the face? Unfortunately no. But first things first.\\n\\n\r\nIt starts quite well, not without disadvantages in terms of animation though. But not a big deal, can hang on, cause of unusual characters and the setting, which is not so worn out, will hang on.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the characters are indeed unusual.\\n\\n\r\nWorick - one-eyed man of about 30. At first glance, humorist, but at the right moments gets serious. Also noteworthy for the side job of a gigolo within his spare from the orders time.\\n\r\nNicolas - an antipode of his partner. Basically quite gloomy personality, but sometimes he is not averse to joke. However, the main feature is that he is deaf and therefore predominantly communicates using sign language. Well, very untypical. \\n\r\nAnd Alex - a doxy that was saved by Warrick and Nicholas in the first episode. \\n\\n\r\nSeemed like, author could just invent a ton of interesting situations for the characters and reveal them as was done in the same Black Lagoon. But no, apparently the author of the manga had found that boring. That's why it was necessary to include a bunch of mystics and drain off all the good things in the toilet.\\n\\n\r\nBesides, the situation is similar to what was happening in Gungrave except that there was pushed a precisely gangster story line during which the viewer was attached to the heroes. That's what was the reason to look beyond all that trash. And what about Gangsta? Unfortunately no. Yes, Worick and Nicolas are interesting characters, somehow very similar to Harry and Brandon from the Grave. But Worick lacks that incredible charisma of Harry MacDowel, and silent Nicolas is a much more mysterious person than a silent Brandon, who is revealed through his thoughts. \\n\\n\r\nSo it turns out that when the battles with various Usual Japanese Students equiped with piercing-cutting objects,  who jump on the vertical walls like superheroes and cut mafioso's packs alone, substitutes mafia's showdowns, the series can be safely sent to the scrap. Another thing that is pouring oil on flames is that the plot develops extremely slowly and informational content of series is very very small. Everything is so slow, that viewer practically falls asleep.\\n\\n\r\nBut that's not all. Despite its record quantity of decent work with quality graphics, Manglobe obviously decided not to strain here. And if the graphics quality of first 5 episodes is more or less acceptable, then begins a nightmare. Curved eyes, distorted faces, mouths on the side of the faces. And it would have been okay, if that was portrayed the background characters, but nevertheless. Sometimes you can guess who of the characters is in the picture only by clothing or hair. Sometimes it was just physically painful to look at the characters, how crooked they are drawn. The same Alex, for example, is drawn crooked during entire series, besides in in each frame. There is nothing special to say about the music, something was playing on the background, but somehow I do not even remember.\\n\\n\r\nTotal, pretty mediocre series about superheroes, which then tries to look as a serious gangster thriller with a seamy side. What for? Unclear... \\n\\n\r\n6/10 - for interesting protagonists, dubber, that voiced Nicolas and screensavers, at the end of the episode, on which, apparently, the entire budget was spent.",

For me being the fan of seinen genre the story was pretty good but the only problem i think this show had was that the only good part of the story was in the second half as we explore the characters back stories. For me the biggest disappointment was the ending of the season as it didn't had any conclusion and they just ended it on cliffhanger and i don't particularly like these kind of shows.Well for the most part the story was pretty well done and i really enjoyed it,\\n\\n\r\nNow for the animation and sound the animation for this show was done by Manglobe which was pretty decent enough as the most setting was in a town with cramped streets. For the sound it was pretty good as it had a electronic mix to it which i pretty much liked.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the most part i think it was pretty good but i don't recommend it watching until the second season comes out.",

            "content": "So after seeing several folks just hammering this anime in their reviews, I decided to write one as well.\r\nThis is a great anime.  Just because the title is Gangsta doesn't mean i'm going to deduct points because the politics and car chase scenes weren't super deep and in every episode.  Nor just because those elements didn't compare to something like The Departed also doesn't mean it can't be called Gangsta nor will I rate it down for not being some other mob movie/show I've seen.  This is it's own show...not one of those.  If you want Departed or the like, watchDeparted.  If you want an anime with gangsters in it and it's very own stories about those individuals...well you got it.\\n\\n\r\nI for one loved the characters.  Worick and Nic are now at the top of my list in anime characters that I truly love....badass, adult characters, not teeny boppers.  So if you're also looking for some teen/school show with 12 year old leads....don't watch this then rate it down because you're disappointed.  This is a mature anime with adult characters.\\n\\n\r\nHaving said that this is also a somewhat fantasy/super power type film to an extent, as it is about some individuals which posses superhuman strength.  It's not magic to be clear though, so don't misinterpret \"fantasy\" nor is it super heroes, but I'm just not sure what else to call it - think drug-induced super human abilities.  I for one enjoyed that aspect versus it just being a regular mob type story.  Also after reading a few other reviews....who says that mob bosses all have to be assholes.  Sure some are, but some without a doubt use their power and influence to help others, even if unlawfully, so I'm not going to get my panties in a wad like some just because some of the mob bosses partake in good deeds.  That's not surprising actually.\\n\\n\r\nIn summary this show has a very enjoyable story.  I will note however, there does not seem to be a Season 2 (at least at the moment) and Season 1 very much ends as if there was going to be a Season 2 to finish showing what happened.  I will not rate this down for that though, because lots of series do this (end on cliff hangers and pick it up in the next season - just watch Game of Thrones if you don't believe me and that show is f'ing the best ever).  Anyway, just be warned though....if you want closure, maybe don't watch this.  I for one however, am glad I watched it and will be hoping every day that they do another season of this awesome anime.  It is very refreshing to me to see adult shows with adults.....   A++\\n\\n\r\nI by the way, was on the border between giving this an 8 or a 9, and I will say I definitely feel it was better than a lot of the shows I rated as an 8, I'm not certain it's as good as some of the ones I rated as a 9.  If i could give it an 8.75 I would...but for now it will have settle for an 8 since that's not an option.\\n\\n\r\nUPDATE - the more I let this show and chars sink in the more of I love it, so making the plunge and rounding this up to a 9 (did have it as an 8 initially).  It truly is an exceptional show....I just PRAY they come to their senses and do another season.",

            "content": "Gangsta is an anime that should not be taken at face value because it makes viewers think, remember, and draw conclusions. While the series is brief and does not leave a whole lot of time for character development to be balanced with action, there is substantial development of the key characters and more than enough to keep viewers hungry. The characters are not easily relatable, and that itself is a challenge to viewers, but one that I personally welcomed. From the thoroughly unique and somehow perfectly on beat opening scene, to the conflict that eats up every facet of these characters, Gangsta is a thrillride for the advanced viewer. Do not watch this anime for the face value of crime, drugs, sex, and violence, but instead look at it from a critical perspective and consider thoroughly what the author is trying to convey through each character. Hopefully as the manga continues the anime will be renewed because it was a joy to watch and a refreshing break from typical shonen anime. Lots of potential to be a staple series in the anime world in a genre that is not usually hyped or overwhelmingly successful. \\n\\n\r\nP.S. Google the name of the city. It will put the show into an entirely different context for you.",

Nicolas much like Hei (Darker than Black) and Hisoka (Hunter x Hunter) are characters that are actually not as strong as many others in the show but they create this ere about them. This is due to very good writing in the show, which shows in other areas like characters inner selves and relationships with each other. The draw back is the lack of relevant story telling, the characters just kinda do their thing and the story kindahappens slowly around them. My final complaint is that the two main characters relationship switches between I hate you and your my brother and it makes things a bit confusing after the third switch in emotions. Also the show teaches you what a jigalow is and no its not the fools with the clown makeup.",

The second half... Well the second half shows its true colors with uninteresting villains, difficult to follow politics at times and an overall clich\u00e9 sh\u014dnen vibe with just about everything.\r\nThis anime tries to deal with themes such as drug abuse, prostitution, and troubled childhoods to name a few. These themes themselves can be pretty heavy and Gangsta would have dealt with them well if only it was consistent with how the show started. Everything after the first 8 orso episodes abandons character development and these interesting themes in place of a typical seinen action anime, which in itself does not have some of the most interesting fights typical to the genre. The story at this point has also become bland so there's nothing to really keep your interest. \\n\\n\r\nTL;DR Gangsta had a promising beginning with decent character development and interesting themes but the anime fails to remain consistent and falls apart after episode 8.",

I liked the manga, so I was like, \"Hey, maybe I *should* watch  the anime. Story wise for both the anime and manga, is good. The only issue that I have is that the actual story starts out a bit slow and it can be hard to understand at times. I do like however the plot twists that come up, but I'll discuss that in greater detail in the manga review. The art wasvery good, at times, the details were lacking, but overall it was very good. The sound is what I liked the most. You could hear bone cracking, blood gushing, and the sound of guts being looked through. That was great sound wise. The character development was very good.  I enjoyed seeing Alex's and Nicolas's relationship develop, as well as their development individually.  I enjoyed this anime because it had a variety of different characters and themes, which I will not go in further detail because I do not want to spoil anything. I do believe that this anime would be longer if the manga was ahead. But since it is not and needs time to catch up, it was only 12 episodes long. That surprised me, but I don't doubt that they will make a second season in the near future. Over all I give this anime an 8 and I will be looking forward two a second season.",

            "content": "So this anime is rated average on MAL, but I disagree. It is above average in my opinion, and I enjoyed so much that I finished it in two days (normally I drop anime around episode 6). Be warned that this review is HEAVILY opinionated, as I really enjoy things that have to do with gangs, the mafia, drugs, criminal underworld, etc. \r\n     Regarding the storyline, it does not a little bit up brushing-up. It is intriguing and hooks the viewer--especially the backstories--but it is told in a slightly confusing manner. This may also be becausethe anime is not and will never be completed, but the major conflicts never get resolved. The climax of the plot is near the end, and there is no possible way that this anime could resolve EVERY conflict in one episode, and they still included the OP and ED, meaning that it is the same length as every other episode. So, if you want an anime that comes together nicely, keep looking. It's a lot like Baccano! in that it has no real ending and the story flies from character to character, past to present, etc. \\n\r\n     The art and animation is perfect and fits the anime very well. It isn't childish and is done in a mildly American comic-like fashion, and looks far more realistic than most anime. Compare it to the style of Death Parade or Baccano!. \\n\r\n     The only reason I watched this anime is because I was hooked on the opening theme, Renegade. The soundtrack can be dark or intense, depending upon the nature of the scene, and it fits the anime very well. I hardly ever skipped the OP, and I am pleased to say that this anime has one of the best soundtracks I have personally heard, but my taste in music is not very conventional. Compare the music to Jormungand for reference.\\n\r\n     Gangsta.'s characters are interesting and come from unique backgrounds, even though the viewer only gets the backstories of the three main characters. It is interesting to look into each character, and most characters are very likeable. There are a few that I love to hate, but the vast majority make sense in the story and are likeable after a while. However, many characters don't receive full backstories and many are not very deep, even though they are an integral part to the story. Some are just copy-and-paste from anime like 91 Days and Baccano!, so be warned. The lack of proper deepness and backstories is likely due to the fact that this anime won't be completed. \\n\r\n     I enjoyed this anime SO much. I wish that there were a second season to tie up the loose ends. The reason I enjoyed it is likely because the themes of crime are similar to those in my story, and also because I so enjoyed Baccano!. The story propels along nicely, the art and sound fit the nature of the anime, and the characters are likeable and interesting. \\n\r\n     The verdict? I think this anime is a great pick for anyone who enjoyed Baccano!, likes the themes of the dark criminal underground, and for anyone who doesn't mind if an anime has little to no humour but loads of violence and an intriguing storyline. Don't watch this if you're not into gore, sexual themes, a lack of a fixed ending, gangs, or any anime similar to Jormungand, Baccano!, and 91 Days. In the end, I think that this was the most enjoyable anime I've seen since Pumpkin Scissors, and that's saying something. Give it a watch if you haven't already, and enjoy the madness unravel to a never-ending mess.",

            "content": "Before I get into the specific categories, let me just say that this series is a lot to take in for a 12 episode series, and hits some almost diametrically opposing points for me, often enough. I was in turmoil watching the show, because I had massive respect for all the intricate parts it was moving about, and this show truly does many things well. Unfortunately, even with so many good parts, there was still something... that just did not click with me. Like many great works of art, you can respect something without being particularly fond of it, but I always try to leantowards balancing technical review versus entertainment, so that I do not focus on one side too often. This anime was done very well, and unfortunately, was just missing some phantom SOMETHING from being considered a masterpiece for me, although it is still likely worth your time.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\\n\r\nSo, here is where the opposing points theory first picks up. As an art fan, nothing is more pandering and annoying than having an anime force-feed the audience the entire backstory through exposition in the first few episodes. It's annoying, and shows an inherent lack of trust in viewer. \"Gangsta,\" is better in this sense, as it very rarely just straight up tells you what is going on. We are given the background of the world and the characters through limited interactions (usually through fragments spoken to Alex) and on top of that, have to sort through a web of politics and time, as the story flashes back to the past of the two main characters Nico and Worick, often. This is truly handled masterfully, but unfortunately, there is something about this world that just... doesn't seem to move. It has a very dynamic plot, and pieces are always moving, but there is just no sense of hope allowed in this anime. Not only through the plot points themselves, but through the lens with which the characters tell us they view the world. There is this ominous sense the entire show that things will go wrong, and that is just the way of this world. This sort of nihilist-fused pacing is strange, as the series is so interesting, but you cannot seem to get wrapped up in something so obviously set for oblivion. I also want to get out there that this show does something truly remarkable, which is blending multiple genres together effectively. It works most obviously as a sci-fi blended crime drama, but there is also a heavy element of almost-buddy-cop comedy, political thriller, social commentary, and many others. While it does not make a product that I would call remarkable, it does balance many things well, and that is, I think, worth some respect.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\\n\r\nI do not think \"Gangsta,\" is by any means an ugly anime, but there is something... absurdly monotone about it. The entire show's palette seems awash in beige and black, and I think this point most defends my idea of hopelessness. Some of the action scenes are well done, but unfortunately, many people (present company included) want to see beautiful scenic renderings and the like, but we do not actually get to know anything outside of the city it takes place (besides flashbacks). We're not actually even sure how it is positioned geographically. I did not read the manga, but I am not sure what the outside world looks like, although I assume from the character's conversations, it is at least better than inside. This focused, earthy art style is just not entirely appealing, and while it does a good job of creating that atmosphere I mentioned, I just do not think that atmosphere is effective for entertainment. Personal thing, that's all.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\\n\r\nI have never actually seen an anime attempt to voice a deaf person before, and to that, this show instantly raises high in my esteem. I otherwise had no complaints, and wanted to make special note that Alex's song that she sings in \"BASTARD,\" later in the show was particularly lovely.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\\n\r\nAs I have mentioned being at odds with the art and story, I have to now defend why I gave this an 8 out of 10 rating. I personally did not think that any character did not stand out (except for the \"mentally unstable killers,\" archetype that the enemies blend into, that was a shame) to me, and every character seamed uniquely human in that they had many layers, and often were at odds with themselves, as we so often are. There were so many small moments that made me question what I actually knew about these characters, and in a story full of unreliable characters, part of the joy was getting to the bottom of who they were. I actually cannot recall offhand a series that does such a mature job of crafting characters that have so many vices without being made to appear weak or ineffectual. Everyone in this show is struggling, and everyone has an implied bevy of trauma they carry around with them, and this trauma translates perfectly. Character's actions and relationships to one another so perfectly encapsulates the effects of trauma is was wonderful to watch. I cannot seem to justify writing down all my favorite moments, as this is a review now an essay, but honestly, the only ones you need to defend this claim can be found by looking at the main characters. Alex working through the guilt and trauma of her abuse are astounding, and the clockwork between Nico and Worick's friendship is so interesting, I still cannot tell if they are friend or foe, and that's a marvelous thing for an English major. I also loved that there is representation for an LGBT couple without it being token or taboo. It is just a passing realization, nothing more, and that is thoroughly human.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\\n\r\nAs I said, this show does many things right, but there are just a few too many things not done so. The atmosphere just did not mesh well for me, and the story and art really dragged down a brilliant character-driven story. It was enjoyable, but I usually binge whole seasons in a day or two, and I was much more satisfied watching this just a few episodes at a time. I think it is because I did truly enjoy it, but some little spark was missing and just did not hook me in, so I never had my heart racing for another episode, it was just my brain respecting the growth of all the things I did like. I don't think I fell in love with this series like I thought I was going to, I just wound up enjoying it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\\n\r\nI've said it plenty already, but this is a good show that made a few choices that I could not get behind. I respect the artistic differences, and did not weigh them too heavily in my accumulative scoring. Still, I think that an 8 is a fair grade for this show, as the things it does right, it knocks out of the park, and the things it does wrong just sort of quietly fizzle. There was never any great breaking disappointment for me in the things I did not like, just an aching sense that I wish things were handled better, so even if I wanted to say it was a mixture of good and bad parts, that longing for the bad parts to be fixed suggests to me that the good carried the weight better than the bad tried to drop it, so \"Gangsta,\" is a very good anime that could have been a masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nRecommendations:\\n\\n\r\n1. Black Lagoon. I saw in many reviews that people were upset at these comparisons, and I find that to be strange. Black Lagoon and Gangsta VERY OBVIOUSLY share many similarities, and in their misguiding anger, I think people are just upset that you can compare the two. Yes, Black Lagoon is a far better crafted anime, but as they are entirely separate stories, recommendations are not contests, they are simply signifiers of some kind of shared sense of something while watching, be that character, plot, theme, or what have you. Black Lagoon and Gangsta are both sci-fi blended crime dramas, with dark, mature characters that you cant help but love and hate simultaneously. Both shows give us characters with questionable and unreliable moral compasses, and gives us just enough to love to balance out the hate. That is more than enough for a recommendation.\\n\\n\r\n2. Darker Than Black. Both of these titles deal with the concept of \"othering,\" or pitting supernaturals up against normals in a savvy political story full of action.",

            "content": "Story: It is your generic shounen. Characters with a jargon name that have super powers. Here they are called \"tags\" because of the specially marked dog tags they wear. The story presents itself as if it was a fusion between Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Shamploo and Gungrave. Gungrave because \"tags\" need medicine to survive and there is a silent protagonist who is exceptionally skilled among his peers due to dedication. Samurai Champloo because of the black girl in the show who would best be described as a blank slate happening to live among two high-spirited, skillful warriors. Cowboy Bebop because of the emphasis on not followinga serious plot and being more like a travel experience, minus the fact that the setting in this anime does not change much - it is a much more local aesthetic.\\n\\n\r\nTake all of those attributes together and you basically get trash that looks good at first. The story seems like it could get interesting, but nothing is ever deep enough to catch your attention completely. Eventually you realize that the world is extremely generic because it runs just like any other gangster show with the fanfiction-level twist that there are super powers involved. The writing in general approaches fanfiction levels because it does not feel like it was making its own story. It seems to just be built out of empty templates of other animes and dramas that the people producing the work has seen. Even if Gangsta. probably was aiming for the generic angle, it slips too far away into fantasy to feel like its urban environment and the authentic experiences produced really matter at all when the story gets to its most important moments. It resembles a highly traditional good guys vs. bad guys narrative where stronger and stronger opponents are sent to them by a mysterious enemy and it is so poorly put together that it feels like that is the fake part of the anime and the buildup sections are the real thing.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The two man characters have nice expressive designs. The third main character has a terribly bland design and she moves in a stiff way, which makes me easily realize how boring this show actually is. It sounds weird, but art can do something like that. There was a lolita character who is designed quite well.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Expertly done voices, especially the deaf guy and the lolita girl. The soundtrack is really daring and takes center stage throughout. The opening and ending themes are really good, but I am not sure if they are among the best. Sound effects are nothing I remember vividly, but I think they might have been exceptionally good at times.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The only character I liked was the lolita girl. She is someone I can identify with. Maybe it is just because I am a lolita at heart would enjoy being with criminals. She also is very smart for her age and it is interesting to think of what she might do as a professor's assistant. Not to mention how forward she was with trying to help Miss Blankslate understand the world better. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Not really enjoyable. The fight scenes were very typical. The scenes about getting requests for errands and things like that were decent at first, but the fact that the action itself was boring ruined that solid acting and cinematography.\\n\\n\r\nOverall ------ 5 ----- Mediocre",

            "content": "Ah, Gangsta.  You're the last of Manglobe's legacy of shows which includes things such as Ergo Proxy, Samurai Champloo, and Deadman Wonderland.  Unfortunately, you let me down, Gangsta.  Yes, Gangsta. is a really cool anime, but it's also really disappointing.  Let's break it down.  The story is genuinely interesting, but the anime messes up.  Now, I have not read the manga, but the end seems a lot rushed.  Aside from that, the story just ends in the middle of nowhere.  Even if Manglobe still were around, I'm not sure we would've got a second season.  Ohwell.  So, even though it was interesting and caught my eye just after the first episode, the fact that it ends in the middle of nowhere and was rushed cause it to receive a 6.  The art is good, though.  It may not have been as polished as it could have been, something that docks it points, but the style and overall feel that the art gave off was brilliant and I loved it.  It's unique and stylistic while the colors keep it down to earth.  So it gets an 8 here.  The sound, although not immensely memorable, did great things for adding to scenes, especially fights.  And the opening and ending are great, as well.  Sound receives a 7.  The characters were all really cool.  I liked and/or enjoyed watching nearly every character in here as they are all either just badass, interesting, or a combination of the two.  That gets another 8.  Unfortunately, the realization that the story shit itself toward the end and the fact we cannot get a season 2 took my enjoyment down to a 6.  All in all, I have to give Gangsta. a 6.  Is it worth the watch?  Depends.  If this slick and cool action show with a darker tone is your thing, it's worth the watch.  Even if you may not think it's amazing, you'll still enjoy it.  If you don't like things like that, then stay away because there's nothing here that's gonna catch your interest.",

            "content": "Gangsta is an anime that comes with an interesting setting. A few clans fight for power using mostly illegal human mutants. However even the setting is barely explored and the story barely starts, then the show ends and you're left with many fans raging about it and calling it worst disappointment ever. Fear not, I'm here to prove why you shouldn't have expected much from it in the first place. \r\nMost of the emphasis of this show is put on the rule of cool. The action looks great and the atmosphere is filled with testosterone, even when it comes to the women, well, some ofthem. The choice this anime makes however is to have very few information scarcely scattered between action. The way the characters and setting are provided with details is by first teasing some information in episode x, the presenting half of it in episode x+1, and then gradually adding more and more to it in the following episodes. This rule has been consistent from episode one until the last and is extremely inefficient. It was predictable that it won't have any chance to have a good ending. Instead the teasing continued until the end and viewers felt cheated.\\n\\n\r\nHowever the way it ends is not the only way we can talk about quality in a show. There are some clear ques of why the writing for this one is rather poor:\\n\\n\r\n1. the setting is complex and confusing. There's a vast number of characters but none are properly presented aside from the two main characters. The clans will play a big role in the plot but having such poorly defined characters will end up leading to a confusing plot where you don't know why X character does Y thing, and if you did it would probably make little sense.\\n\\n\r\n2. information is being obfuscated. Some is teased but never given. Some is teased and gradually and inefficiently given away.\\n\\n\r\n3. there's too many things happening at the same time. Pacing ends up being unbearably slow. Plot becomes confusing.\\n\\n\r\n4. there's too many flashbacks and they are inefficient. This also ends up hurting the pacing.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the main reasons for why this anime is bad and probably the source material as well are not just the fact that the anime ends in a horrible place, but because the writing quality is poor.",

            "content": "Okay, so if you've heard anything about this anime it's probably that it's disappointing. That they tried to cram too much into the twelve episodes given, and then the ending kinda killed itself. That, at the end of the day, this anime is little more than 'read the manga fodder'. Well I'm here to say...\r\nThey're not completely wrong about that. \r\nThe anime's story is very refreshing. It's about two bachelor's hanging out in a crappy apartment. One has a day job of being a prostitute, while the other is a deaf swordman. When they're not brutally killing people for cash, they're helping the cops getto the bottom to crimes, or saving prostitutes. Basically they're handymen, and if you've got the coin they're willing to do it. Along the way they save a prostitute named Alex, who's lost her memories thanks to the drugs her pimp forced on her. But things go to hell in a hand basket thanks to the politics in the city, and the 'Tags', people who have strange powers.\\n\\n\r\nThere should have been no way that this story went wrong, but thanks to Studio Manglobe's melt down, they tried too hard and it showed. They threw in side characters we didn't have time to care about, sub-plots galore, and a pretty crappy ending that made you wish you read the manga instead. Other than that one thing, and maybe the art but that's a personal preference, there's really nothing wrong with this anime. The story's cool, the voice acting for both sub and dub is solid, and the music is fun to listen to. In general, I highly recommend this anime.\\n\\n\r\nJust so you guys know, you can watch this legally on Hulu.",

            "content": "A fairly decent anime. It starts out very well and the events match the title, however as it goes on there is an odd way of revealing some human experiments, altered humans and by the time you are clearly told this it's too late as by then you see some odd superhuman movements from the main characters and you wonder what the hell is up with that.\r\nI was wondering if this is an anime that is like durara or like gungrave or something else. It was really hard to figure out what the story had in mind and it would been much better if itwould have been made clearer at a much earlier point in the anime that there are characters which are part of a human experiment and their impact on the world aren't just mere exaggerations of the anime, which actually very common in animes.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThe story was a huge let down, although it started very promising and although it's not a cup of sun shine it still had the potential to shine with a nice 10, regardless of the ending. However there are just random characters showing up to then show off during battles and basically everyone is just dicking around and acting cool. This is a good way to trash a story and ruin a good plot, turn it into a pile of vomited events (and no i am not talking about the flashbacks). The random introductions of super powers and greater super powers and then random unnecessary uninteresting villians just to have a reason to continue the story makes it a bit irritating.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nWhat made me keep watching were the characters. The earlier characters the series start with are actually interesting. But then as the story goes on either cannon fodder or overhyped characters are being introduced.\\n\\n\r\nBy cannon fodder i mean doug, the 21 year old dual wielding sword master. His eyes are a bit too moe style for this anime and i understand he just didn't grow tall, but his appearance hurts the anime and prevents you from taking it serious. It looks more like the annoying brat that ditched school, decides to act cool and dances in front of the traffic, nearly getting hit by a car. Glad it dies in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe exaggerated and overhyped characters of this anime don't even get a proper fight. They just have godly plot armor, which is really irritating. What really ruins these sort of characters even more is the fact that two of them are lesbians, unrealistic lesbians on top of that. The issue with them being lesbians is the fact that they are lesbians just for the sake of gaining few extra pubertant fans who are still completely unfamiliar with girls. Yes, exactly, they are lesbians for the sake of those weird fetishists who watch shows just because of it, just to keep those creeps watching. Absolutely sexist and disgusting move by the plot writer.\\n\\n\r\nThe memorable characters are the one eyed blondie, the guy who talks with his neck coz he is deaf and never learned to talk and your daily backstreet prostitute singing on the sidewalk (alex). These get good development and decent backstories. The characters have depth and aren't there just for show, but neither are they shallow anime figurinjes that just act up and get overhyped. Overall about any earlier character is pleasent, especially when you compare them to the ones introduced later on. The cop at the police station and even the old baba selling cigars. The nurse and the doctor were also great characters, although a bit odd.\\n\\n\r\nThey later introduce a 10 year old and that's about when the character palette really gets trashed and crapped upon. It's a little boy with superhuman strength that effortlessly matches that of super human adults. Sure he is part of a special breed of superhuman adults that lack some of the downsides, but he can still match adults that are part of the same special breed ... wtf? It's just a physical imposibility, lower force doesn't match greater force. Simple. It's like the anime is testing you and asking you constantly the question: \"ok how about we introduce this shit, are you still going to watch this nasty crap, although it started out so well?\" Well unfortunately i did, just as i did with so many crappy animes.\\n\\n\r\nNow last but not least, examples of how characters also get ruined later on. So the one eyed blondie makes a joke about the backstreet prostitute and she slaps him for that. It is absolutely out of character considering what went on early in the show.\\n\\n\r\nEarly on the alpha male lesbian that is captain of one of the region in town, gets angry and punishes two characters just for fighting. However later on when half the city starts to fall apart and burn in flames, she isn't phased and wants to let someone else do the fighting. Not even her beta lesbian friend will jump into the fight although the beta lesbian has fought on countless occasions before that. Unrealistic lesbos btw, considering how they hoard man like nymphomanic sluts ... i dunno what you think, but girls who suck that many cocks can't be gay.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art might not be liked by everyone. Personally i liked it, most of it anyways with few exceptions. Great art.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI really didn't like the opening/ending songs. Totally garbage. But aside from that i did like the sound quality.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI enjoyed watching the first few introduced characters, which became the ones i sympathized with, go through their daily life. And that's about the only reason i kept watching.\\n\r\nI found the non-talkative, throat voice guy very interesting character. It seems he never got messed up, his super strength is even revealed to be due to an overdose on drugs, which actually makes him more interesting.",

            "content": "Man hands, man hands every where... I would like to start off by saying that some people are judging this anime way too hard due to the ending and other minor factors. The studio who created this anime, Manglobe, went bankrupt and had to quickly produce the series, so they were not able to bring this anime to it's full potential. In other words, yes it not great but it is not a complete pile of garbage that some say it is. Trust me there are anime's that were done WAY more poorly than this one. The story is actually interesting, tags that are \"superhumans\" who do dirty work for contract holders which are regular everyday humans. What is more interesting is that every tag has a rank to show who is the best of the best. It is quite a fascinating plot because it makes this world almost seem inhumane by controlling these tags because they (the tags) are sort of humans themselves. The story isn't all that perfect of course, it jumped around all over the place to the point where I would get lost and think, \"umm, what!?\" However, that does not mean it was bad, it was just poorly executed but it still was able to piece together in some odd way. I would say I enjoyed each of the characters back stories a lot more than the story itself  because it made them more interesting and gave them more appealing attributes. I had more of a reason to feel and grow with the characters throughout the series. Of course not all the characters I cared for because some of them felt pointless and didn't progress the story. Oh, and something that TRULY bothered me throughout the series was how off the body proportions where at times. I swear they gave Alex and other female characters man hands, and some times the characters heads, feet, eyes, noses, or something was a tad off. In other words, the art wasn't all great but again the studio had to rush to finish the series so there were screw ups in the art. The opening credits I found beautiful though, I loved the bright colors which made it pop and the op credits theme was on point. Nevertheless, the art and sound were nothing terrific, kind of average to me but it wasn't awful. Also, I must say that I found it awesome that they introduced a character that could use sign langue, it sort of blew my mind. (Mainly because I have taken sign language and to see it in an anime was amazeballs!) Lastly, I cannot forget to mention the finale episode of this series. Alright, it was not at all the greatest conclusion, it was definitely rushed, but it did make me all the more interested in seeing if there will be a second season for this series. Yes, this anime was no where near great or shouldn't get highly praised, but it did keep me interested and I want to see more of this world and what it has to offer.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the story is intriguing. Though it does have lacking factors that does not mean it is terrible. It most definitely kept me watching until the end, even though there were some boring slow moments it still had some twists. The art and sound were good but bleh at the same time. The man hands started to get to me after a while, and the sound wasn't all that memorable except for the op credits theme and art. The characters were very compelling, though not all were necessary. They made me feel and care for some of the characters. Enjoyment was there, though at some points I had lost a bit of interest I would still watch and it would pick right back up again. Again, people are judging this anime so harshly, but looking at the concept of this anime, and the world it has to offer, it is great but only if it was executed correctly. Hopefully, if there will be a second season, another studio will pick up this dusty gem and bring out its true potential.",

            "content": "A fairly good show, but I just can't seem to enjoy it. \r\nStory: 7\r\nThe world this show is set in is pretty solid, the city Ergastulum has an extensive backstory and how things in there work actually makes sense. \r\nHow the whole Twilight thing works and what exactly the position of the government and other parties is, i'm not sure yet. I don't think it will be totally revealed, but as of now there don't seem to be any inconsistencies or things that don't make sense. Well, it doesn't really matter, because the story focuses on Worick and Nicolas doing their jobs as Handymen. Ienjoyed the part where they were just getting introduced, taking care of the jobs no one else wants to do. However, they take on a job that seems beyond their expectations and quickly spirals out of control, and so does the story. Bad things happen that don't need to happen, lots of people die and I'm not against that, but for it to happen just for the sake of having extra gore and keeping the audience interested seems unnecessary. Also, the choices characters make are illogical. \\n\r\nFor example, there's a scene where countless Twilights die, and the usually unbeatable Nicolas loses a fight for once. He gets saved by some over-powered girl who beats the shit out of their attackers with ease, but they escape and stir up more trouble further in the story. Why the hell did they escape so easily when they just got beaten up? Every time something like that happens, i'm just sitting there, thinking about what could have been better. I still rate the story a fair seven, mostly because the real problem lies with the characters. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5\\n\r\nI'll be honest, I didn't like anyone except Worick and Nicolas. Alex just plain annoyed me, I wasn't interested about her backstory. The rest is either a complete villain or being nice to everyone. The good ones are, save Worick and Nicolas, naive and too nice for their own good. I couldn't help but think 'just kill them' during the scene I described, and more choices like that are made the rest of the show. The bad guys are bad without reason, and were not interesting. Not much to say about. \\n\\n\r\nArt and sound: 8 \\n\r\nThe art was fairly detailed, and looked nice, but the character design was bland and boring. The OP is disastrous, the ED was nothing special, but you can skip those, so no big deal. I did like the sound effects and voice acting. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3\\n\r\nI'm probably just a pain in the ass, but all these weird choices and inconsistencies killed my enjoyment. I was interested in the story at first, but then I kept getting annoyed and didn't care anymore about the characters or the story. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\r\nAs I said, I'm just being difficult and there is a big chance that you'll like Gangsta, because apart from the flaws I named, the story is interesting and intriguing. Just not for me. It wasn't so bad I wanted to drop it. \\n\\n\r\nFinal score: 6",

            "content": "Overall one of the most enticing anime I've ever seen. I would say one of the biggest flaws would be the shows uncontrollable urge to constantly add new pieces of content which ultimately muddies the waters. Viewers are often left with questions like \"who's that?, what's this?, and sometimes, what the fuck?\" Besides these issues and the fact that the show has no way of introducing closure to any of the components presented, the show was beautifully animated and styled with the likeness of a modern Samurai Champloo and vibes to match. I'd recommend this show to anyone looking for something to tie them overuntil they get another show to watch.\\n",

This adult crime family like tale mixed with super humans presents a darker more sad tale than most crap anime you see these days.

The series leaves off at a interesting part and has much more tooffer.",

(that rhymed unintentionally lol) The thing that stood out the most to me was the art of the OP. I almost wish the whole anime had been stylized like that. It certainly would have made it more interesting! \r\nI wanted to like it, but it was difficult to watch. Not because of the violence, cuz I'm fine with dat, but the whole thing had a dirty, grimy feel too it. Naturally, I figure this is because one lead is awell- bosomed female prostitute, another lead is a male prostitute, there's drug addictions, sex, murder, and power struggle. In other words: this is an adult anime.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all it was okay, but by the time I had finished it, I wished I had picked something else to watch, so I'm probably never going to rewatch this one.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I dropped Gangsta. 9 episodes in, however looking back on it I should've dropped it back at episode 5.  It has a solid premise, interesting characters, and a unique enough world, and it squanders all of it.  I dropped Gangsta. not because it was bad, but because it had so much going for it and it somehow didn't deliver.\r\nThe characters are the perfect example of this push/pull failure.  Worick is a male escort who's turned to either vigilantism or investigation (honestly I can't remember) and Nicolas is a \"twilight\", basically a FotNS-esque superhuman with above average speed and strength.  Gangsta. offersa traditional yet fun dynamic - seedy underground hooker with traditional soldier - but does almost nothing with it.  You don't feel a connection between the two.  Nicolas could be some random kid who walked in off the street, and it wouldn't feel any different from the bodyguard backstory they dropped on the viewer 2/3s in.\\n\\n\r\nBut by and large, Gangsta.'s biggest issue is that it's just a bland, forgettable, boring pile of animation in a genre where the whole point is standing out.  It's been about four months since I've seen Gangsta., and I couldn't even remember the main character's names.  I don't remember the world, I don't remember the story - of which there is not much - and I don't remember anything except everything looking grey.  And when you're writing in a genre where the entire point is to be over the top, violent, and dramatic, I think this speaks for itself.\\n\\n\r\nNow, let me be clear that Gangsta. wasn't offensively bad.  I'll admit I genuinely enjoyed the first few episodes back when I thought it was going somewhere.  The opening has some fun imagery, and Worick's design is pretty cool...okay I'm stretching for positives.  If you enjoy dime-a-dozen gang anime with an honestly interesting twist, you'll probably like Gangsta.  But if you're not into that pretty specific genre, you'll either be bored or confused the entire way through.",
