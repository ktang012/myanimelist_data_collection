            "content": "Graphics/animation\r\nThe overall art design is beautiful, very atmospheric. The only \u201ecriticism\u201d this show usually gets is the use of CGI, but after re-watching those scenes Ill call it good. Apart from a few scenes where the Terran mechs looked really clunky most of the time they were using various tricks to make the robots blend into the background which included the clever use of camera angles, lighting, colors, smoke, snow etc... The show is easy to follow and visually appealing.\r\nMusic\r\nAs many have stated already \u2013 it\u2019s great. Hiroyuki Sawano showed us again what a talented composer he is. But since this is a review aboutthe anime and not the OST I want to talk about how they USED the music in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nUsually the music\u2019s role in a movie or a TV show is to enhance the experience during certain scenes. Problem is when you overuse it you will achieve the exact opposite and take away from the intensity of the scenes. Instead of letting your audiences make the interpretations for themselves about how they should feel (based on the visuals and the sounds) you force feed them with the information by using music.\\n\\n\r\nThe only time when the director showed real restraints were the final scenes in episode 12. This added more depth and emotion to the final showdown which is admirable. Wish the rest of the directing was on par with that (in terms of using the music I mean).\\n\\n\r\nWorldbuilding/war/politics\\n\\n\r\nThis is probably the worst part of Aldnoah Zero. Since the anime is focusing on both sides I was hoping for a show where at least the basics (history, motivations) are done right, but nope. It\u2019s pretty obvious that they wanted to tell us a \u201ecool\u201d invasion story, but put minimal effort into the worldbuilding. I would say if your knowledge about history, politics, economy, social behavior (etc...) is limited to Hollywood movies you can come up with a BS like that, but what we see on screen is disappointing at best (or causes brain aneurysm at worst).\\n\\n\r\nStory/action\\n\\n\r\nAfter the first two episodes it\u2019s quickly established that the Martians are \u201esuper-duper\u201d powerful and the Terran military is pretty much helpless against them on a worldwide scale. This could have been a nice approach if the show was about the desperate fight for survival of the Terrans, but since it\u2019s about them kicking some Martian assess you know that won\u2019t be the case. This time we get a Japanese high school student called Inaho, a genius, who singlehandedly comes up with amazing battle plans to defeat the invaders.\\n\\n\r\nI have to admit it that compared to the \u201ethe-main-character-gets-an-overpowered-robot-for-no-reason-and-beats-everyone\u201d clich\u00e9 this is sort of refreshing, but gets boring really fast. Especially because the more you think about it the more you realize that while his plans look good on paper, based on his observations he could have came up with different conclusions/interpretations. Meaning he is making somewhat logical wild guesses and he turns out to be right every single time.\\n\\n\r\nAnd naturally he is also able to flawlessly execute these plans, because he is an ace pilot who mastered the art of sidestepping instead of standing still and waiting for the fatal blow while screaming like an idiot.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nOverall bland and boring. Only four of them are worth mentioning.\\n\\n\r\nInaho (protagonist) \u2013 The new \"industry standard\" empty shell with some desirable traits (genius, chick magnet etc...) so the average viewer can project his own personality at him and say \"oh hey look he is just your everyday normal person. Just like ME\".\\n\\n\r\nSlaine (protagonist) \u2013 The best written character in the show (most likely unintentionally). Led by hormones and emotions, tossed left and right, naive and easily manipulated. Exactly how most teenagers would react in his situation.\\n\\n\r\nSaazbaum (antagonist) \u2013 The only bad guy in the show who has a reasonable motivation which puts him way above the rest of the cartoony villains. Sadly his reasoning and actions often contradict each other, but considering the overall bad writing he gets a pass.\\n\\n\r\nMarito \u2013 The alcoholic, traumatized war veteran. Since Inaho solves everything his potential gets wasted and remains at the sideline.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nAldnoah zero is basically the anime version of a Hollywood action movie. Just like the majority of the overhyped stuff this one also fits the \"the-more-you-think-about-it-the-more-you-hate-it\" category.\\n\\n\r\nIt has a really catchy premise, some nice action scenes, but on the other hand its full of plot holes, one dimensional characters, plot conveniences, clich\u00e9s, etc..\\n\\n\r\nOverall it\u2019s a very \"effective\" anime that knows its targeted audience, but won't be remembered 10 years from now.",

            "content": "They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, but at what point do we cross the line between paying homage to other works and being a complete ripoff? Many titles have been labeled as copycats or cheap knockoffs before, usually riding the coattails of tentpole entries to gain recognition. Every storytelling medium has this occurrence, and with anime, it's no different. But every once in awhile we get a title that doesn't just copy a well-known property but takes it a step further by copying the definitive title in its respective genre. A public display of pillaging so unforgivable, that in the court ofpublic opinion, it's usually met with disgust and pitchforks in the form of verbal diatribes. Aldnoah.Zero is such a title, a show so full of itself that it didn't just have the audacity to steal the entire Mobile Suit Gundam setup, but it does so without even batting an eye, xeroxing it down to the minute details. \\n\\n\r\nAt times, the changes made were so minuscule that the only thing done was name substitution. The circumstantial evidence of which was so apparent, that by merely reciting the setup of its premise, the tumor-like symbiosis that it shares with the patriarch it draws blood from could still be seen desperately clinging to the surface; bite marks still fresh from where the ideas were directly leeched off from, stopping no short of wholesaling arcs and iconography in its entirety. \\n\\n\r\nMankind is broken into two separate governing factions, with the ones residing in space, the Vers Empire of Mars, treating the inhabitants of earth as inferior relics of their past. With bad-blood still looming over both nations, the people of the Vers Empire finally declares war on their former \"Terren\" brethren once again, after the temporary truce of a fifteen year period of civil unrest was finally brought to an end. With these two nations plunged back into battle, a ragged-tagged group of teens and public servants find themselves swallowed up in the chaos, leading to their boarding of a military vessel, as they pilot mechs and fend off the endless wave of enemy invaders. Poorly trained and doing everything in their power to survive, the only hope left for this motley crew is to seek out the assistance of the Earth's united front, as the fight for dominion over the planet marches forward. \\n\\n\r\nSound familiar? \\n\\n\r\nThe idea of \"paying homage\" quickly topples like a house of cards when the piracy on display is this blatant.\\n\\n\r\nThe fresh coat of \"Vers Empire of Mars\" paint still wet, as it barely covers up the stolen \"Principality of Zeon\" ornament positioned underneath. But try not to wince too much, you need to save your composure for the rebranding of \"newtypes\" as \"Aldnoah users\" and all the subsequent \"borrowing\" yet to come, as the story drags itself down an inevitable path. The impression of reverse engineering can't be ignored, with plot points charted out from lifted passages of other works, the bold outlines of which already taking shape before the actual arc does due to little to no effort placed towards diversifying the formula.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd if that wasn't apparent enough, this is a show that deploys shock factor moments and plot twists, but the obviousness of it being there all long prevents any of it from truly being \"shocking\" in any sense of the word. Like whenever you watch a horror movie and everything cuts to silence while the character's hands grip the side of the bathroom sink, the medicine cabinet left open, and\u2014you guessed it\u2014a jumpscare occurring right after they close the door and the mirror reveals something standing behind them; an act that's usually highlighted by a loud audible stinger. You may have involuntarily been spooked at those scenes in movies before, but at no point were you surprised by the placement of the jumpscare itself. That's the feeling that Aldnoah has with its content. When you do nothing but take ideas from other works, it's hard not to see things coming from a mile away. It could still keep your interest because of it, but any sense of validity it may have been desperately holding onto can only be taken seriously from those still new to the experience or less-demanding of their consumer goods. \\n\\n\r\nThis is also true for the main character, Inaho, a default bodysuit made with the sole purpose of giving the viewer a shell to occupy as they walk around the scenery. His expression marked off with a thousand-yard-stare, with an interest in eggs being the only discernable desire shown (no, I'm not even joking). The thin veneer of a \"personality\" is barely there. I've seen dozens of self-insert male protagonists in my lifetime, and yet even I am taken aback by the sheer lack of effort on display here. Being emptied of any personality also seems to be the secret ingredient to becoming a genius tactician as well, as Inaho defeats numerous military personnel using what little school-combat training he acquired before the war broke out. \\n\\n\r\nBut Inaho, lover of eggs and master of combat, isn't alone. Joining him on the main lead podium is his antithesis, Slaine, a person with perhaps too much emotion to spare. Fighting for the Empire of Vers, Slaine is our proxy to see things from the other side. Although, it's more of a surprise that anyone would even grant him a chance to fight any battle instead of placing him in a mental asylum. For every instance of Inaho acting like the human embodiment of a brick wall, Slaine is channeling his inner Joke..., Jared Leto's Joker. It's honestly pretty entertaining, if only for all the wrong reasons. Like if all the autism of the newtype breed in Gundam was balled into a singular entity then condensed into a neutron star. That \"star\" being this highly volatile character, ready to \"go off\" at a moment's notice\u2014and boy, does he ever \"go off.\" \\n\\n\r\nAs if making meta-commentary about the show being a bootleg version of the Gundam franchise, the mecha suits themselves are these jagged clumps of computer-generated apathy. Horrendously processed things that act as constant reminders that you're watching an anime and not truly experiencing it. Thankfully, some of the people staffed with bringing this anime to life seem to have cared about the finished product, as the post-production made attempts to mask issue as much as possible. Fights would often take place at dusk or dawn, with dust and debris kicked up to camouflage the inherent ugliness of the suits in motion. Pilots divebombing as they're surrounded by snow, the cast shadow of a winter storm draped behind them. Busy locations with buildings and landmarks to keep from fixating too much on the CGI combatants. It was all very commendable. Didn't stop the rest of the staff from not giving a fuck, but hey, at least someone tried. Also, Yuki Kajiura did Yuki Kajiura, so there's that. \\n\\n\r\nWhen watching Aldnoah.Zero, it's hard to get upset at it. Sure, you could raise your pitchforks high for what's a blatant ripoff, but really, who cares? It's not going to stop Gundam from existing. There's a 65-foot replica of a Mobile Suit overlooking Tokyo bay after all, while the most adoration Aldnoah is getting is a few action figure purchases off of Amazon's website.\\n\\n\r\nWith lots of violence, cartoonish villainy, and silly narrative twists to go around, Aldnoah.Zero was an entertaining off-brand. The kind of thing you pop in for cheap thrills and occasional blips of entertainment, only to forget it 15 minutes later when you do decide to watch an actual show instead. With all things considered Aldnoah just ended up demonstrating just how much of a seminal piece of work its parent title is, and if only for that bit of indirect self-reinforcement, I accept this dimestore bootleg into the fold.",

            "content": "Spoiler Warning: This review will spoil specific plot points in certain episodes in order to provide examples of why Aldnoah.Zero writing fails for a number of reasons. While I attempted to keep spoilers to a minimum, it\u2019s best recommended to avoid reading this for those who have an interest in checking out Aldnoah.Zero and don\u2019t want anything to be spoiled. In a nutshell, Aldnoah.Zero has the aesthetic for a great series, but no substance to support it not offering anything in between all the eye candy. If you plan to continue reading past this point you have been warned.  \r\n\u201cFiat justitia ruat caelum\u201d isa Latin phrase that means justice must be achieved no matter the consequences. Its usage varies depending on who uses the phrase, especially those among writers in any media, but it has significant value in history prevalent in important court cases where a judge reflects on the duty of the Court. Why do I bring this quote up? This is Aldnoah.Zero tagline that is shown alongside the anime logo in the opening animation. Except it\u2019s translated to \"Let justice be done, though the heavens fall\" in English. Not only is it a misuse of the quote because of A.) Politics don\u2019t exist in Aldnoah.Zero, B.) Heroes aren\u2019t in any danger because of it\u2019s lead character, C.) villains don\u2019t face the consequences despite going against direct orders from their superiors, and finally it\u2019s a one sided conflict that\u2019s black and white with no significant meaning tied to it. Aldnaoh.Zero is a plain and simple a mecha anime about good versus evil. Yet even with that much simplicity no amount of eye candy is able to disguise the poor writing of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nUnredeemable: Nonsensical Story \\n\\n\r\nAldnoah.Zero takes place in the futuristic year of 2014. Basically last year at the time of posting this review. I double checked around the internet and some local newspapers just to make sure this anime wasn\u2019t based around any true events. If they were based on true events than this anime would have played out differently with some level of logic. The anime follows main character Inaho who is thrust into a world of conflict when a peace mission goes disastrously wrong. Everything about it first episode is a mess in writing. It\u2019s bad in establishing the setting, introducing characters, and creating a central conflict that have a sense of weight to it. What exactly it was trying to achieve in its first episode is unfathomable. \\n\\n\r\nWithin this first episode characters provide a quick summarization of a war that occurred in the past in some unnatural exposition. Apparently Vers and Terrans aren\u2019t really all that different since both race when boil down are basically humans. It is also explained that Princess Asseylum is attempting to ease the tension between Vers and the Terrans who I\u2019ll refer to as Earthicans. As soon as something bad happened to Princess Asseylum the Vers Empire immediately launches a military invasion on Earth. A race of species that is more technologically advance than Earthicans apparently doesn\u2019t know how politics function. This one moment becomes further questionable when shown a sick emperor in bed and told he has authority over the Orbital Knights (basically Vers military). The Vers Emperor didn\u2019t issue an attack on Earth to start a war, yet he does nothing to punish those who killed possibly millions. He even goes as far as calling a ceasefire with Earthicans to negotiate peace which goes nowhere near a brain cell in the story. Orbital Knights can do whatever they want without repercussions. In episode 8, Saazbaum, a high ranking Orbital Knight kills another high ranking Orbital Knight and this is never brought up again, nor is the fact he kidnapped a prisoner who was being tortured for information mentioned to him. \\n\\n\r\nFor the central characters, they are never in any danger because of leading character Inaho is the solution for any battle. The other characters don\u2019t get the opportunity to contribute in a battle lessening the group dynamic and eliminating the purpose of teamwork. Inaho plans always work out due to luck or plot conveniences. Usually his plans have smart setup to them. Like in episode 3, Inaho uses a toy plane in order to determine what kind of camera a specific Vers mech is using and how it functions in recording its surrounding. Then the actual plan itself throws away logic in order to write a scenario that best suited to make an action scene around. Opting for escapism over intensity which fails due to how it was set up only to be ruined by good luck in execution.\\n\\n\r\nStill on episode 3, it\u2019s established that a mech uses drones in order for its pilot to see the area around him. In a later episode it shows the Vers empire have developed some sort of teleportation device for communication. So by this anime logic; something difficult like teleportation is achievable for this race, but apparently not allowing it\u2019s own pilot to control its own camera drones from within their own robot is not. No matter how often the anime claims the Vers Empire has the superior technology oversights like these show up regularly which can\u2019t be forgiven. Escapism itself is broken when down the line another plot point will either break that immersion by what it reveals or create more nonsense. The thought of how these Martians who have superior technology, yet act so stupid never leaves the mind.\\n\\n\r\nOne major problem as a whole in the anime is the lack of weight that comes from a worldwide invasion. It never gets across that this war between the Earthicans and Vers Empire is a global issue. Only focusing on a single group never bringing up how other parts of the world are holding up. With a self-contained mindset this central conflict feels less like a major catastrophe by the way it chose to depict it. A small scale approached backfires when the central characters are static when introduced all the way to the end. Supporting characters do change somewhat, but they aren\u2019t the focus feeling free to just leave their storylines dangling in the finale. \\n\\n\r\nEpisode 1 shows a Vers mech using lasers, but other robots Inaho and his group fights against use practical weapon like swords or projectile arms. Despite in several battles Inaho proves with limited training he\u2019s able to overcome any opponent that uses a practical weapons. Vers never change up their tactics, even when it has a success rate of zero percent. Vers strategy comes down to only sending down a single one of their mech pilot to fight against large numbers of Earthicans mech pilots. Not once in this season do the Vers Orbital Knights ever mention perhaps sending two experienced pilots to fight against Inaho since he poses a major obstacle for them. Another issue regarding the weaponry are the soldiers of Vers do have guns, but for unexplained reasons gun type weapons aren\u2019t made for their mechs and if they are not implemented in battles. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime also explains what kind of power source the Vers Empire uses for their technology. Once this plot point gets explained it further questions the villain's motive. Basically, if the only two people who are able to provide power die Vers is as good as dead. Now from the villain's perspective it makes no sense to eliminate the only source of power for your own species. The villain claims he wants to help the masses, but still goes with his plan to kill the royal family, even though they are the key to supplying their planet with energy.\\n\\n\r\nThe final episode of Aldnoah.Zero first season is awful and unfulfilling in every sense. At this point, none of the central cast are developed to care about and the one supporting character who has potential is pushed to the sideline in the finale. Like in previous episodes, there is no sense of suspense on the character's livelihood as they already have victory in their hands by plot convenience and enemy pilot stupidity. Inaho doesn\u2019t struggle much to fight against a pilot whose mech is a combination of mechs that he already fought. With that alone, it guarantees his victory because at this point it proves Vers aren\u2019t intelligent despite the writing claims that they are. How it ends is weak and purely for shock value. Narratively it\u2019s a horrible ending because it forgets to inform the viewer status of Earth, which is at war with Vers. Only offering a narration of what happened to the characters it focused on. Leaving the fate of its central characters ambiguous isn\u2019t bad, but in this case when the characters are one dimensional who really cares what happens to them. \\n\\n\r\nUnredeemable: Shallow, inconsistent characters, and miss opportunities\\n\\n\r\nInaho Kaizuka is a young teenager of average height, short tousled black hair, and our lead character. He\u2019s stoic and despite what his sister claims about him being human in episode 10, Inaho never actually shows human emotion. When he does show emotion it\u2019s out of character; in episode 1 Inaho expresses his interest in buying eggs that are on sale. Within the same episode, a couple minutes later Inaho sees Princess Asseylum of Mars killed in front him, remaining stoic at the sight of it. Showing no concern despite the clear consequences of the assassination he has just witnessed. Later on in the series the anime attempts to ship Inaho with Princess Asseylum which simply does not work because of this one moment. So any affection Inaho shows to his \u201clove interest\u201d is as artificial as the robot he uses. Expecting you to believe he developed emotion for his \u201clove interest\u201d when he showed no reaction when he saw her presumably die in the first episode. \\n\\n\r\nAs a leading character events magically have a way working out for Inaho even though it\u2019s establish in episode one he\u2019s a trainee of the military. Somehow, with minimal training, he surpasses Martian pilots who have had more experience under their belt in actual combat. It\u2019s not because he smart that he wins. It\u2019s either due to plot convenience, his enemy being stupid, or a mixture of both. Another skill Inaho has over his far more experience comrades is the ability to move out of the way of attacks. This godly power can\u2019t be obtain by the other pilots. All of which are usually standing around in front of an enemy attack until they get killed. Granted evasion should be obligatory in basic combat training, but if allowed so Inaho wouldn\u2019t be the overpowered self insert lead that he is. \\n\\n\r\nIn episode ten, Inaho claims that anyone that fights against the same enemy on his side he considers an ally. A statement that is completely proven false in episode seven when he shoots the plane of a Vers pilot that helped him fight for an entire episode. These inconsistencies further weaken the anime when Inaho has no consistent traits let alone a consistent philosophy to believe in. Inaho becomes as much of a plot device as everyone else he interacts with. Finally, Inaho is the character that delivers a speech about how war is used to gain something and ends until the objective is met or the cost outweighs the gain. Not a bad position to take when voicing your thoughts on war, except this character has never shown sympathy when killing his enemy nor ever mentally coped with taking someone's life. He says within the same speech here cares for no such emotion to gain anything in war. So this whole war speech in the final episodes coming from a lead who said he himself \u201cI care for no emotions\u201d is forced to sound deep and makes Inaho full of himself.\\n\\n\r\nAnother major character is Princess Asseylum (who I refer to as Princess Ass since she doesn\u2019t give a shit) is the embodiment of Aldnoah.Zero problems. Easy on the eyes and pleasing, but shallow with no identity of her own. The anime only gives her positive traits like acting like a child when she\u2019s learning about Earth with Inaho and desiring doing the right thing. She looks nice on the surface, but that\u2019s all. In actuality she\u2019s a terrible character. Asseylum has been friends with another major character, Slaine Troyard, for five years showing no concern for him throughout her near death experiences. When reversed, Inaho proved in about a week's time showing no emotion he\u2019s able to capture Princess Asseylum's heart. In context, the anime wanting to ship Inaho and Asseylum makes no sense given how little time they\u2019ve known each other. It\u2019s also brought up in a episode she knew someone was trying to kill her, and doesn\u2019t bother to take extra security just to be cautious in case anything happens. Then again, the Earthicans don\u2019t bother giving her protection when they attempt to keep her safe so I shouldn\u2019t be surprised.\\n\\n\r\nSlaine Troyard (not the only pointless reference to Greek mythology) is another poorly written character. His conflict of wanting to be accepted by the Vers Empire is worth investing on paper. Having to overcome the racist mindset of his superior officers and being treated like scum. In execution it\u2019s the opposite, creating scenarios forced to make the viewer care for him. There\u2019s an entire episode dedicated to Slaine being tortured, which doesn\u2019t since in the same episode, it shows Princess Asseylum without care enjoying the day. This episode's impact is lessened when the entire Vers race is one dimensional and not given any redeeming values to perceive them as actual people. \\n\\n\r\nSupporting characters, just like the main three, that receive tons of screen time are merely plot devices. There was potential with the character Marito to create a satisfying subplot. His back story is compelling, has likable traits by being himself, and has a strong personal turmoil that he can\u2019t immediately overcome. Seeing Marito struggle and trying his best to improve himself provides the best moments in the anime. Unfortunately, by the finale his subplot is left unresolved. \\n\\n\r\nAnother wasted opportunity is with character Yuki Kaizuka (Inaho\u2019s sister). Like Marito, Yuki carries a permanent scar from war with her. Unlike Marito conflict, Yuki war scar is resolved quickly and has no important use afterwards. The thought of her brother being an expressionless killing machine never bothers her either. When one of Inaho friends asks Yuki why Inaho is expressionless. She answers by saying yes, he does. A wasted opportunity to develop Inaho beyond a stoic lead, and a miss opportunity to explore what kind of life, Yuki had with Inaho since the status of their parents' livelihood is never brought up. Other minor supporting characters serve a single purpose. There\u2019s one created to simply die, there\u2019s one that created to be simply racist against Earthicans, there\u2019s one simply created to be sick so the Vers can have power, and so on.\\n\\n\r\nRayet Areash the worst of the supporting cast being given a position in the anime similar to that of Gavrilo Princip. The anime attempts to paint her in a sympathetic light, except for the fact that it was her fault as well that millions of people got killed. Forgetting this fact, it dedicates an entire scene in episode 10 where she blames Princess Asseylum for something out of her control. Somehow she\u2019s able to make Princess Asseylum feel guilty. This is the equivalent of making Archduke Franz Ferdinand the villain and making him apologize for being assassinated. It doesn\u2019t work that way, even in fictional context when the entire starting point for the story's existence is because she helped in the assassination. For unexplained reasons, she\u2019s also allowed to do whatever she wants on a military base.\\n\\n\r\nThen there\u2019s the villain Saazbaum who is about as well thought out as the writing in the anime. This character personifies how nonsensical the writing is in physical form. For starter, his motive contradicts his goal. He hates the royal family for manipulating the masses, but the first episode the emperor sends his daughter to Earth for a peace mission. He also initiates an attack on Earth without consulting the emperor. Despite his intentions to help the masses, he fully should grasp the consequences of his own action by attempting to eliminate the only source of power for the Vers Empire. These two points don\u2019t add up; just like the Vers technology and their actual intelligence. The writing never treats the characters it creates as actual characters. They\u2019re a means as story devices and nothing more.\\n\\n\r\nGood: Production side of the anime is generally good\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is a joint effort between A-1 Pictures and Troyca. Together they create an anime that all around looks great. It clearly has a high budget incorporating both 2D animation with nice looking 3D robot models that aren\u2019t distracting. Environments in general tend to come across as being large and empty. Since our heroes are on the move battles, mostly take place in environments where nothing much is happening in the background. In some cases, it is put into good use to keep an action scene moving in an large environment as well as showing some environmental destruction. In one action scene, the size of an environment is use to its advantage when Inaho has to stop an attack from a Vers mech on an ship he\u2019s on. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, the biggest drawback is there\u2019s no visual scale growth in the battles. One of the few memorable scenes in Aldnoah.Zero is in the first episode where an explosion has a similar impact to that of an atomic bomb hitting Earth. Buildings crumbles, cars are blown away by a gust of wind, onlooker to the site are in shock, and it\u2019s large scale destruction implants what a serious threat the Vers Empire is. Everything else, past this moment feels smaller in comparison. There isn\u2019t another scene that visually comes close to matching the mass destruction in episode one. All the characters have appealing looking design no matter the situation. Especially Slaine, who even when being tortured looks good! Particle effects are in no short supply to adding more visual flair to the battles. \\n\\n\r\nOne questionable decision in the animation would be the mechs even when stationary are still in 3D. It makes sense in a action scene to use 3D since the thirdimension offer more maneuverability than a 2D plane, but it comes across lazy when mechs are stationed and simply there to show off its high budget. The downside to the animation is the awful staging of the action scenes. Going more for visuals splendor than actual staging. So in most battles there will be multiple mech stationed in one position accepting their death or shooting to hold off an enemy attack. Without a single creative battle that avoid doing these things action scenes are a one time deal for entertainment. \\n\\n\r\nVoice acting is serviceable. The writing didn\u2019t offer much in anything so the voice cast are stuck with what they are given. Natsuki Hanae plays protagonist Inaho and he\u2019s stoic throughout the series. His vocals, mostly stay in emotionless delivery range sounding uninterested in anything. It\u2019s not a compelling performance because there\u2019s no range, but he does portray how the character was written properly. Then there\u2019s Kensho Ono, who plays Slaine, who has a slightly more open role. He gets to scream in pain when his character is tortured, sound serious, concerned, and in the finale near hysterical when he goes insane. Ono role is similar to Hanae where in both performance they have to repeat themselves. Sora Amamiya plays princess Asseylum. It\u2019s passable in general. When Amamiya portrays the more innocent and childlike side of Asseylum she\u2019s convincing as Asseylum, but when in a dramatically heavy scene she falls short. She\u2019s sounds like she\u2019s on autopilot delivering most of her dramatic material with little variation no matter the context of a scene. \\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast in general suffer from the same handicap that Natsuki Hanae is given in which they mostly portrayed a single character trait. This is especially true for voice actors that get casted as Vers Martians. Show Hayami who plays Cruhte only yells for his time on screen. Only having one tone voice in the series. Inori Minase plays Edderlrittuo and sounds like a little girl. It\u2019s an appropriate performance getting across Eddelrittuo sisterly love towards Princess Asseylum. \\n\\n\r\nTooru Ookawa plays Saazbaum and unlike Hayami who\u2019s allowed a single scene to change up his act Ookawa isn\u2019t as fortunate. His performance isn\u2019t bad, but it\u2019s a single note role where one line delivery is no different from line another delivery. Takahiro Sakurai plays Trillram and thanks to his more expressive character taking delight in killing people. He\u2019s the most enjoyable screen presence out of all the pilots that Inaho fight against. Yuki Kaida plays Femieanne, Hiroki Yasumoto plays Vlad, and Mamiko Noto, who plays Orlane aren\u2019t as lucky in playing interesting villains. They lack the proper screen time to make something out of their role being forgettable once off screen. Sachika Misawa plays Rayet Areash. While the character is full of herself Misawa performance is fine since she does her best to make her character sympathetic despite what she did. There is a scene in episode 10 where she\u2019s allowed to express her dislike for the Vers empire and it\u2019s a highlight for her performance.\\n\\n\r\nAny Japanese voice actor playing an Earthican gets sideline eventually into the background. Unlike the voice actors that play a Vers. Earthicans voice actors don\u2019t have a single episode where they\u2019re given a highlight moment to show off their acting chops. They get stuck in a single note sometime delivering the same lines of dialogue word for word in different episodes. Ai Kayano who plays Darzana Magbaredge and Yuu Shimamura who plays Kaoru Mizusaki have this problem. Whenever they share a scene together, it plays out the same getting repetitive over time. \\n\\n\r\nThe best voice actor in the cast regardless of what race he portrays is Kazuya Nakai and that\u2019s because he plays Kouichirou Marito. His character suffers mental turmoil while on the outside, he shows a free caring personality. Nakai is allowed the freedom to vocalize different sides of a single character more so than anyone in the cast. When he mentally breaks down it\u2019s believable through his delivery. His performance is the most interesting because he\u2019s funny, likable, and a compelling actor in the role. It\u2019s a shame that his character isn\u2019t fully use to his full potential in order to create a good character.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is composed by Hiroyuki Sawano mixing ambient and techno music with aggressive synthesizers, beats, even some 8-bit and a few thunderous orchestral compositions thrown in with Japanese singers singing German lyrics. The music is all around a great fit for the anime and when used correctly in its placement creates some stellar scenes. In episode 1, the musical piece \u201caLIEz\u201d sung by mizuki is played during a scene of mass destruction is instantly memorable. It\u2019s not as demoralizing seeing an atomic bomb like explosion at the sight of a more technically advance race, wiping out humans with ease, but it\u2019s a cool scene none the less. As great as the music might be there tracks that get reused frequently. In particular the track \u201cBRE@THLESS\u201d sung by mizuki is used in a number of action scenes. Preferably when there\u2019s a chase scene this track will likely play. Losing what made them exciting musical pieces in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime has a single theme song that\u2019s also used as the ending theme in episode 1 is titled \u201cHeavenly Blue\u201d by Kalafina. Despite the less than stellar opening animation \u201cHeavenly Blue\u201d manages to create a strong atmosphere with orchestral composition along with a catchy chorus. It does feel slightly phoned in since there\u2019s not an extra push or power to the track that really demands your attention. The following tracks are sung by mizuki are \u201caLIEz\u201d used as an ending theme in episode 4, 7-8, 10-11 and \u201cA/Z\u201d in 2-3, 5-6, 9. \u201caLIEz\u201d loses some of its impact since it\u2019s used frequently in the series failing to rekindle the same feeling when hearing it for the first time. While the usage in the anime distracts from its impact over time the track is a great listen. \u201cA/Z\u201d is more of a techno side with 8-bit beats that\u2019s more optimistic in general. In both tracks mizuki vocals add to the songs; in \u201caLIEz\u201d her vocals are on a level of opera singing those high notes beautifully sounding as epic as the interustmentals. In \u201cA/Z\u201d she sounds almost robotic like which is fitting for the track. Sawano score is fantastic, but how it\u2019s used in the anime tends to undermine it. \\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: It killed some brain cells\\n\\n\r\nUsually the first time I ever see an anime I don\u2019t go in them with a critical mindset. Although, fleshed out characters and a story that have working elements is part of the requirement for an anime to be enjoyable for me. However, the first episode did so many things poorly that I couldn\u2019t simply see it without critical thinking. What flipped the switch in my brain was the scene where Inaho showed more emotion for a sale for eggs more so than he does the princess of another planet trying to bring peace to both race when killed in front of him. From then on it\u2019s been nothing, but an infuriating experience how little of the anime was fully thought out. I was so infuriated by Aldnoah.Zero I didn\u2019t bother waiting for any news regarding an English dub. I went into writing out a review for it. Not even the action scenes for as pretty as they look were awfully staged and required very little to no strategy on the characters part. Aside from hearing Hiroyuki Sawano score there wasn\u2019t any other good reason the anime provided to keep me watching. If it ain\u2019t evident with a review consisting of over 4000 words that I think very poorly of Aldnoah.Zero first season I don\u2019t know what will convince you.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 0/3\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 0/3\\n\\n\r\nTechnical: 3/3\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: 0/1\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nAldnoah.Zero is nothing more than eye candy and takes pride in that. It\u2019ll excuse logic and good characters if it means it\u2019ll get to show off nice looking action scenes. Understanding what type audience, it wants to appeal to, but mere action spectacles aren\u2019t enough to make an anime worth viewing. It takes itself too seriously unable to be dumb fun, it\u2019s too idiotic to touch on the topic of war maturely, and paints each side in black and white dumbing down the premise to be approachable sacrificing depths along with it. Its central lead wins through a series of plot convenience and luck that remove the suspense of battles. It\u2019s all aesthetics and without substance, it guarantee its own expiration date in a short amount of time. Once you\u2019ve seen the explosions and action there\u2019s nothing left to Aldnoah.Zero.",

            "content": "Aldnoah.Zero not only flashed the name Urobuchi before it aired, but it was supposedly seen as the love child between Legend of the galactic heroes and gundam wing. I'm glad they used a condom because Aldnoah.Zero would tarnish their names through association.\r\nAldnoah.Zero follows the strained relationship between humans (commonly referred to as Terrans) and Martians (from mars). After an assassination attempt on the princess of mars, war breaks out with the Martians, whom wielding their sacred Aldnoah technology fight against the earthlings. The show depicts the war from both sides.\r\nAldnoah.Zero follows the mecha genre in more of a 'super robot' format than the 'real robot'format due to the mysticism of Aldnoah technology. As for the themes of the show, it attempts to highlight how the hate and obsession of what others have, as well as prejudice, can lead to the loss of many human and martian lives. The show also dabbles into the characters feelings of what the war personally means to them, as well as if there will be anything gained from it. As for the fighting, it's based more on tactics than on brute strength, as the Martians  overwhelming technology would mean outright victory if it wasn't fought on tactics. As for the pacing, the shows first three episodes are paced well with very good plot development and suspense in each episode, after that the shows pace shows down, usually ending on a cliffhanger each episode.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the show is ruined by the large amounts of 'anime logic', in which events favor the main characters too much rather than being slightly more realistic. For example, although the Martians have almost invincible mecha robots due to their power, the glaring and awful design of them leads to them being defeated with only the slightest bit of common sense. As this happens each week, none of the fights contain any suspense due to the high amounts of predictability. Furthermore, after episode 3 (low and behold, the end of Urobuchi's involvement in the show entirely), the episodes lose their valor, pondering on pointless dialog, with slight hints of character development and slow plot development.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the animation, a large budget would have been needed for this show, as the fights with the mecha are done to a very high standard. Although the transitions and  movement of the mecha are not super smooth, it didn't have a negative effect on fighting scenes.\\n\\n\r\nLeading onto the cast, this is where the show really disappoints. The main protagonists are Inaho (terran), Slaine (a terran who works for the Martians), Princess Asseylum vers Allusia of mars and Rayet (a martian). As for character  development, it's night and day between the protagonists. Slaine it's the most developed in the show, he is constantly striving and struggling to do what's right for the princess and although he may get things wrong, he fights his hardest to work to the goal of saving the princess. It's very similar to Rayet, whom acts more towards the end of the show as someone who moves the plot along, this comes from the peril she has come across during the war affecting her greatly, which leads her to take action.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, the princess and Inaho face little or no development. The princess is too pampered for most of the series, and only starts truly knowing the extent in which the war has had on everyone's life. But it's Inaho which divides most opinion. Inaho has received virtually no character development at all. For a character that shows no emotion when his friend dies in front of him, it's difficult to look at him as being a relatable character, and therefore is difficult to like. His lack of emotions may make him look cool under pressure, but in the end he comes truly across as cold. Not to mention his brilliant tactics, as he is the only person who can defeat the Martians, he becomes so overpowered he virtually takes control of the army ship whilst others stand by and watch, which ends up being very boring.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the opening song, it starts off slightly classical before turning into a slight heavy jpop song, which I didn't really sit well with. The original OST was very good, making each battle distinct and entertaining. The show contained no ending song.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, Aldnoah.Zero is a prime example of how name dropping and high expectation can ruin a series, and it did in this case. Although it was the most talked about anime this season, I wouldn't recommend it due to the poor writing of the show.",

            "content": "\"Let Justice be done, though the trainwreck rolls.\"\r\nAldnoah.Zero is an original sci-fi mecha anime about an intergalactic war between Terrans and Martians. It was highly anticipated because of the superstar names under the ones who made the show, A-1 Pictures, Gen Urobuchi as the original story creator and script writer and Hiroyuki Sawano making the soundtrack. However, the creators and hype don't guarantee a good anime, and we witnessed that in full bloom here.\r\nPlot:\r\nAfter a Martian princess Asseylum Vers Allusia comes to Earth in attempt to form a friendly bond between Terrans (Earth habitants) and Martians (Mars habitants), she is assasinated during a parade. OutragedMartians launch a massive attack from Mars to Earth in attempt to annihilate all Terrans. The story follows a group of students with a military unit as they try to survive the war against the superior Martian mechas, Aldnoahs.\\n\\n\r\nThe war plot is fine for the most part, but there supposedly was another war 15 years before the events of the show which ended with massive consequences. The Earth is already in an apocalyptic setting, but there's no exploration of it at all. The anime starts destroying the setting in the very first episode without any establishment at all. The results? You don't care about what's going on!\\n\\n\r\nThe story is extremely predictable. It was sure as hell that the princess survived, and that Martians themselves participated in the assasination. The show attempts to have tension, in the early episodes following a \"villain of the week\" format. The problem is in the extreme differences in mecha power, with Aldnoahs basically wiping the floor, so it takes a lot of plot armor for our protagonists to overcome the enemies. So much that you barely care what's going on, because no matter what the odds are, our heroes always win.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nI've mentioned \"you don't care what's going on\" a few times in this review already. Well, this is the section where everything starts going downhill, with the characters. Billions of people die, but our heroes don't care at all. They witness a genocide right infront of their eyes, but the level of apathy shown was so high I didn't think it was even possible. The worst care scenario is Inaho Kaizuka, the main protagonist. I really thought his lack of emotions or personality was a plot point and there would be an explanation as to why he doesn't give a shit when his friends die infront of his face, but there wasn't. He is a silent super smart guy that wins battles using anime's insanely stupid logic and flawed physics, and forms a sub-harem with chicks he travels with, because girls must be interested in the main character at all times for no reasons given.\\n\\n\r\nMoving forward, we have Inko, Calm and Nina, completing the student group, once again having surprising level of lack of emotion, but not so much as Inaho. Yuki Kaizuka is the overprotective nee-san of Inaho, who also acts as a bridge of connections for the group to get into the military unit. Rayet is another girl that joins the fleet later on, and she was part of the group that was told to assasinate the princess, but her father is slaughtered infront of her eyes and all she does is blink. Lieutenant Marito was the most laughable attempt of character development through PTSD I've seen in this show and anime in general for a long time, the potential he had from episode 1 was huge but he ends up being completely irrelevant. Ending the 0 to 1 dimensional characters is Magbaredge, the unit's leader.\\n\\n\r\nThings are more interesting in the Martian side, where we have a deuteragonist Slaine acting as the protagonist there. He formed a bond with the princess being her teacher about Earth, but even he is a one dimensional character whose sole purpose seems to be saving the princess, and having a one to two personality traits. Saazbaum is a plot device, has some sort of reason behind his actions but they're not explored. Princess Asseylum was the best character of the show, as she is the only one who gives a shit about people dying everywhere and has some sort of personality. The villains of the week of the Martian sides are just 0 dimensional dolls that have insanely high amount of pride and disgust for weaklings and they all lose because of that.  So much potential wasted!\\n\\n\r\nThe problem with the characters is that you just don't care about them. Most of them are just emotionless puppets or plot devices that are there to just be there or just to move the story forward. Marito, Saazbaum and Asseylum were the only ones who had some sort of internal conflicts and were the only ones who were affected by this tragedy and that had influence on their actions (and not that they had lots of time to get decent amount of exploration considering everything that was going on), but the rest of the cast? Genocide is an everyday thing, guys! It doesn't even help the characters that they get Urobutchered in the end, it was just a sad attempt to create drama and tragedy.\\n\\n\r\nWriting:\\n\\n\r\nAnd here we get to the most awful part of the show. The writing is just ludicrous. There are millions of instances of plot inconsistencies and defying logic of physics and common sense, so much that you cannot take it seriously. Plot holes were just glaring throughout the entire anime, and even if the anime does get a second season in attempt to gloss them over, they just destroy any sort of fluid continuity or attempts to care about the situation when they just flip it over 360 degrees with introducing a new plot device or solving the issue with deus-ex-machina. The characters don't help either, there is no global perspective of humanity and what do they do in this situation, or how was their life inbetween the wars. Everything that we know comes from the characters that the story follows, and they are just awfully apathic, effectively making everything useless. If the characters don't care, neither does the audience care.\\n\\n\r\nAll of the battles between the Terran fleet and the Aldnoahs consist of the Martian Knights being overconfident, playing a \"cat and mouse\" game and getting Jerry'ed. One moment they destroy entire cities just upon landing, and in another moment they get shot from a pistol and explode. It is extremely hard to take fights seriously with such huge power disparity between sides, with the weaker side winning all the time because of defying logic of physics or just because of plot convieniences. Not to mention, the Aldnoah concepts of power are extremely stupid with such advanced technology of theirs that they just can't crush a piece of metal can that is a normal mecha the Terrans use. The audience is led to believe that the Aldnoahs are supremely powerful, but that never happens in the fights for some reason. At this point, I just wanted the writing crew to try and save the fights by introducing a super-powerful mecha equal to Aldnoahs to give to the main protagonist and try to have cliched, but atleast logically reasonable battles.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the anime does stay away from unneccesary fanservice and doesn't try to have comedy out of place. They do have a pseudo-comic relief character in Calm, but the themes are not butchered because of it: it is trying to be a mature story without any distractions, and they do a good job at telling a story without the need to throw boobs at you every 5 seconds to keep you interested.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and sound:\\n\\n\r\nI have to give credit where credit is due, though. Animation looks really solid in this one. The character designs are okay, the mecha designs are okay. Even the CGI looks fluid, to be honest. However, sometimes (and especially the last episode) the action is just so quick you barely know what the hell is going on, what was damaged and what was not. It should have toned down the tempo during fights so you can clearly see what happened or what is about to happen, because considering the power inequality between sides you may reach to wrong conclusions after an attack happens.\\n\\n\r\nHiroyuki Sawano is often found guilty for overusing the same tracks over and over again in the soundtrack. He did it with Shingeki, he did it with Kill La Kill, and Aldnoah is no exception. However, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. The grandiose scale style of Sawano's music fits perfectly with the action, and it was one of the main reasons I still followed this show after so many shortcomings. And yes, he uses a lot of German lyrics in this one too.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening sequence is pretty basic, it has nice visuals but a really generic and lackluster music to go with, it gives a big Fate/Zero vibe. The ED to the show, \"aLIEz\", is Sawano's one of the best tracks created, and it especially fit in the demolition part of episode 1. The other ED, A/Z, is pretty basic and unmemorable.\\n\\n\r\nSummary:\\n\\n\r\nAldnoah.Zero is a rather failed attempt at creating an exciting mecha battle show with tragedy, as it is lackluster in both of the categories. It ends in Urobutcher's style, on a cliffhanger, and barely resolves anything. As with all Urobutcher shows, a proper characterization of the cast is non-existant. The second season is scheduled to air in January 2015, so atleast that has going for it, which is nice, but in all honesty, after this first season there shouldn't be lots of expectations going forward. It is just an another anime with overblown hype, with medium thinking that famous names grant a well made work. They don't. And I only enjoyed the soundtrack, and which is the only good thing this anime can provide.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: 4.2/10\\n\\n",

            "content": "When I first heard that Man of Steel was referenced in an interview pertaining to Aldnoah.Zero, with Gen Urobuchi also playing a small part in the project, I had a general idea of what to expect from the series. I wasn't wrong. The high production values, high amounts of collateral damage, questionably bland characters, and a controversial ending are a close match to the recent DC Comic film about Superman. Mix in some grim thematics that Urobuchi is notorious for and we now have our new mecha tragedy series. \r\nWhile the overall premise of Aldnoah.Zero is heavily based off of the tension and prejudice betweenthe people of Earth and the Martians of Vers is easy to follow, there are many parts of the writing that qualitatively vary from good to bad. There are aspects that I enjoyed, such as Inaho actually using some tactics to outwit his opponents and smooth plot progression, but there were also very noticeable flaws. One of the biggest gripes I had with this series \u2014 though it may seem like nitpicking to some \u2014 was its historic timeline. In 1972, the Apollo 17 mission finds a hypergate to Mars on the surface of the moon. The astronauts discover Aldnoah, which grants them immense knowledge, technical prowess, and ability to colonize Mars. Soon after, many humans from Earth migrate to Mars and form the Empire of Vers. In the span of a couple decades the Vers Empire obtains and acts on their newfound feeling of superiority over Earth. The Vers Empire ignites a war and instigates heavy collateral damage to both themselves and Earth. It's as if Aldnoah gave the people of Vers technical savvy at the cost of brain damage. Considering that the martians came from Earth not too long ago themselves, and the first generation of immigrants are mostly still alive, their heavy prejudice comes off as confusing and highly implausible.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Aldnoah.Zero are extremely hit or miss. Inaho, a Japanese high school student, is one of the main characters of the series. Unfortunately, he also has the personality of a stone. For a majority of the series he's portrayed as intelligent, emotionless, calm, and collected. Allied forces, friends, and civilians getting killed right in front of his eyes? No problem, poker face. About to get killed during a battle with a superior Martian mech? No problem, poker face. He\u2019s the stoic, but well-collected type of character, which people will either enjoy or despise. Despite being an offender of using this character archetype, it's hard to point the finger at Aldnoah.Zero specifically. Nearly all mecha anime are like this; you can never win. In any given mecha series you will either get a genius-level pilot that gets things done at the expense of personality or a useless, beta MC that relies solely on asspulls, a significantly stronger mech, and the power of friendship. Personally, I prefer the former. \\n\\n\r\nAs much as I'd like to discuss Slaine and Asseylum, since they are the other two major point of view characters, it would be difficult to do so without spoilers. In a broad sense, they're not bad characters. Asseylum is a bit generic, taking on the typical pure, benevolent princess role, while Slaine is basically the pinnacle of suffering and angst. At the very least, I can say that Slaine was interesting to watch.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the rest of the cast aren't terrible, they also aren\u2019t exactly a well-written bunch. Because there isn\u2019t a lot of screen time allotted to them, most of the supporting cast are easily forgettable or just completely insignificant. The main antagonists of the series, the Orbital Knights of Vers, are originally perceived as extremely dangerous due to the power of Aldnoah and their vastly superior Cataphracts decimating the Earth armed forces opposition. Unfortunately, their glaring character faults begin to show upon entering combat with Inaho; they quickly turn into nothing more than a villain of the week plot device. Marito, who gets noticeably more screen time than other side characters, is haunted by his past and PTSD. Originally I thought the whole PTSD idea was interesting. You don\u2019t see too many series touch upon the subject and relate its severity well. The problem with Marito and his PTSD is that it\u2019s constantly shoved in your face on several occasions for little to no reason. It\u2019d be one thing if Marito grew as a character and showed any signs of recovery, or usefulness for that matter, but there isn\u2019t. His scenes in the second half of the series acted as nothing more than empty screen-time devoted to reminding the audience that Marito has been traumatized. That time spent focusing on Marito could have been much better utilized in fleshing out other characters who desperately needed depth. It\u2019s disappointing that it wasn\u2019t.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest attribute that Aldnoah.Zero has going for it is the aforementioned production values. The series looks and sounds fantastic. I'm not a fan of CG, but even that is visually implemented very well. The OST of the series was surprisingly quite small, in comparison to nearly any other show. Most of the background music, despite sounding sublime, is reused often. The concept of having less tracks, but making them of higher quality is something I might like to see more often. It worked well in this case.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the first season of Aldnoah.Zero was a fairly good watch overall, it seemed more like a setup for what\u2019s to come in its second cour. We\u2019ve been introduced to several characters and plot struggles, but nothing too substantial came about until the ending of the first season. It\u2019s unclear what direction the series will go in, but I suppose we\u2019ll just have to wait and see.",

Character development is sadly not very existent, and the story is mostly predictable with a few twists (except the end...)\r\nStory: 7. Rather predicable with a few twists. Coherent for the most part. Was best in first few episodes and the last 2. In between I kinda felt like watch someone play a RPG. You know, defeat a bad guy, oh look, there's a new one. The ending was unexpected... but feels really random. I really wonder what season 2 will be like.\r\nArt andSound: 9. CG was used but it fit well, flowed smoothly. The music was great. The OP and ED are both decent. Eye candy. This made the battles a joy to watch (if you didn't pay much attention to the script/writing).\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5. Decent characters but not developed. Some side characters had interesting backstories but they were never used. Just kinda in the background, like \"Hey, I'm still here\". Villains were all the same except the main, who probably had the most depth out of all the characters... Ok fine, like 2 other \"good\" characters are developed ok... but development is kinda absent for everyone. I hope season 2 fixes (improves on) this. The characters have been introduced already, can they develop now?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8. Self-explanatory. Read above.",

            "content": "War is a controversial word. People fight in wars for a variety reasons. Oppression, liberation, or imperialism are just a few reasons. But fighting a war for survival sometimes also become a reason without choice. In Aldnoah Zero, that war takes place in 2015. After fifteen years of peace, we have one side from Mars (the Vers Empire) trying to annihilate Earth off their existence in its galaxy. To say the least, Aldnoah Zero hits where it hurts. It establishes the foundation of sci-fi action series with war but also other factors packaged into this Summer extravaganza. \r\nFor starters, Aldnoah Zero already had several keypoints that made the show one of the most anticipated series prior to its release. The key staff involves Gen Urobutchi, who served as the script writer of the first three episodes. The combination A-1 Pictures\u2019 production qualities with Hiryouki Sawano\u2019s music score also creates the tension of what may be expected. Nonetheless, the series is done without any source material. It\u2019s a standalone show divided into two halves as this review will cover the first split cour.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s much to learn about the origins of the series. If we go back into history, the show actually established its origins over 40 years ago. In 1972, an alien artifact known as the Hypergate was discovered that made colonizing on Mars possible. From there on, the powerful yet mysterious technology known as the \u201cAldnoah\u201d was discovered that allowed settlers (later known as Martians) to survive there. The catch is that these Martians declared war on United Earth after establishing independence. An event known as the \u201cHeaven\u2019s Fall\u201d occurred that shattered Mars breaking the war stalemate. Now present in 2014, we have this princess named Asseylum Vers Allusia from the Vers Empire coming to Earth for a visit. Unfortunately, an assassination attempt ensures and all hell breaks loose. If all this sounds a bit generic, then you\u2019ll probably right. Without a doubt, Aldnoah Zero dances around with the concept of a war between two fronts \u2013 the Martians (Vers Empire) and the United Earth (Earthlings). Not to be confuse with invasion, both sides seeks to maintain superiority over the other.  However, there\u2019s also a catch in that Asseylum tries to create a state of peace like it has maintained 15 years ago. But who are we kidding here? The first episode breaks the boundary of any sense of peace when a terrorist attack occurs in full view of the public. Not only that but New Orleans goes out with a big bang. Peace? Hope? Prosperity? What Heaven\u2019s Fall established is what the tagline suggests:\\n\\n\r\n\u201cLet Justice be done, though the heavens fall\u201d\\n\\n\r\nAs a sci-fi action series, it\u2019s easy to say that the show is consistently engaging and challenging itself. The first episode creates the tension between the Martians and Earthlings already with an attempted terrorist attack. In full of the public, we witness the princess \u201cdie\u201d as an assassination attempt. On the other hand, we also meet the earthlings. However, it\u2019s hard to believe in the hype when we realize that the main characters are no more than mere high school students. The guy that may or may not stand out is Inaho Kaizuka. With a strange interest in eggs, the young boy is a difficult character to read. His calmness (as demonstrated during the terrorist attack) and intuitions makes one of the most mysterious character of the series. Throughout the course of the show, he also demonstrates tactics with excellent calculations and strategic maneuvers. His risky moves often puts others at risk but his stoic face often shows that he has confidence in an almost predetermined-like outcome. That\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg though. Joining Inaho are his friends, allies, and even his sister who also plays a crucial role in the military. But perhaps the most prominent ally of Inaho is none other than the Vers Empire princess herself. \\n\\n\r\nThe Vers Empire family is an interesting generation of characters to say the least. Unlike most of the Martians, Asselyum is sympathetic towards Earth and its people. She wishes to create a state of peace and even has fascination of Earth\u2019s inhabitants and creations. Her kind nature sharply contrasts with most of the Martians as they wish to invade Earth and destroy it. However, there\u2019s a noticeable flaw that viewers may see from her: self-insecurity. Throughout the show, she constantly tells herself that the ongoing war is perhaps her own fault. This is considered faulty logic considering the fact that the Martians are looking for an excuse for a war. (the attempted assassination) In fact, the behaviors of some of the Martians could even be described as borderline psychotic such as the case of Trillram during his crazed rampage on Earth. Others such as Vlad are more careful with their goals. However, their motivations remain the same and that\u2019s to destroy Earth. Yet, there are some people from the Empire who seeks other reasons to come to Earth. A prominent example would be Slaine Troyard, an Earth born human (Terran). Flashbacks reveal his encounter with the princess during his childhood and since then, the two have become very close friends. Unfortunately, Slaine isn\u2019t exactly a character that receives credible characterization. His one motivation seems to be his interest to reunite with the princess. Throughout the war, he reluctantly fights the Terrans, kills a fellow comrade, and even undergoes intense torture after an attempted escape from a Mars capital ship. His temporary alliance with the Martians also becomes his fault as he quickly learns the consequences. In retrospect, Slaine\u2019s loyalty could be his downfall as his actions creates tensions between him and the Martians.\\n\\n\r\nThis series doesn\u2019t quite have a taste of originality to its premise or delivery. The prejudice of the Martians against Terrans isn\u2019t something new in sci-fi series. In this show, it borderlines on the line of genocide and imperialism as the Martians wishes to establish supremacy in the universe. A quick look back will make us realize how desperate some of them are with their tactics such as falsely trying make their Emperor believe that the princess was assassinated. Still, most of their characters have a one dimensional view of Earth. Only a few of the Martians get characterization throughout the show and surprisingly enough, Cruhteo (Slaine\u2019s superior officer) is one of them after he discovers the truth. Similarly, Saazbaum is also both an interesting character and antagonist. His role in the war eclipses most of the single minded motivations of the other invaders as he wishes to gain revenge for results of the Heaven\u2019s Fall. \\n\\n\r\nRevenge actually has more of a meaning though. One particular character wishes to regain revenge against the Martians after her own father is killed in the ongoing war. Her motivations become increasingly dangerous with PTSD-like tendencies as she tries to assassinate Assleyum herself. These self-motivations builds on the psychological impact of how war can be. The truth is that war is fought for reasons but there are no righteousness with the laws. Heaven\u2019s Fall is just one event that gained the vengeance of certain characters. \\n\\n\r\nOn the Terran side, there\u2019s a plague of clich\u00e9s when it comes to the character cast. We have the childhood friend Nina (with a presumed crush on the protagonist, Inaho), the lone wolf Rayet, the energetic Calm, Inaho\u2019s older sister Yuki with a tough boss type attitude. The character cast on the Earth side lacks characterization or depth on most parts. Inaho stands out as the most prominent character not just for his roles but as a soldier and tatician. The strategies he utilizes often are risky but the results are often surprising as the Martians realizes his skills. And speaking of risks, Aldnoah Zero plays a bit around with drama. Unfortunately, it feels brain-dead with the way it\u2019s executed and almost silly at times. To say the least, it also creates a sense of manipulative tearjerker with the ongoing war struggles. Comical moments has weird timing as well and some jokes are generic with repetition. There are also a lot of ironic moments in the show and cruelly timed moments that may seem unpredictable but feels generic once the dust settles down. At the same time, the show has a fast pacing especially with the other main protagonist, Slaine. He becomes a major scapegoat for his troubles as he fails to stop the war, betrayed by a temporary ally, and tortured by his own superior officer.  It\u2019s really hard to see him as a role model with what he has done despite his seemingly good intentions that ends up being left stranded. Other issues of the series include asspull moments although some of it is minimized by strategic scenarios with Inaho being the main cause.\\n\\n\r\nOn the technical front, the visuals establishes the fact of a futuristic/alternate setting. The sci-fi themes are most definitely featured with exquisite features such as the mecha used. The lost technology used by the Martians have distinctive mecha designs such as Trollheim\u2019s defensive Kataphract Nilokeras, the six-armed Kataphract Hellas, and Vlad\u2019s modified machine armed with proton swords. In retrospect, they are impressive and shows the difference in firepower between the Martians and the Terrans. The way CG is adapted also hardly distracting. However, character designs of the Terrans are generic. In fact, most of the main characters look nothing like members of the military. Neither Inaho nor Slaine has any distinctive characteristics at all. However, Asseylum stands out as the princess with her pure beauty and elegance. On the other hand, her personal maid/assistant looks like a child that makes us wonder if the show takes itself seriously at times. Still, overall action coordination is magnificent with the choreography and well-timed battle scenes. Fan service is also minimal except during one shower scene. Take it for granted as this show is a cinematic blockbuster with the artistic delivery.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack plays more of a role than just being part of the series. The brainchild of the soundtrack, Sawano, brings together an intense set of beat with its techno style OST. It seizes moments to capture every battle at the core while climaxes are delivered with memorable moments. (see New Orleans) Kalafina\u2019s involvement with the theme songs is also easily recognizable as well. Striking the right and balanced cords, the show\u2019s soundtrack becomes a prominent centerpiece that\u2019s even more as a supplement. Voice mannerisms also makes its point well with Inaho\u2019s stoic expressive dialogues, Assleyum\u2019s calm way of speaking, and the Martian\u2019s aggressiveness. You want wartime drama? You\u2019ll get wartime drama. The soundtrack makes it that damn more acceptable.\\n\\n\r\nAs a sci-fi science show with war themes and mecha, it\u2019s easy to say the show might not be for everyone. The story has problems with its writing when it comes to some characters. There\u2019s also no escape of clich\u00e9s with the characters themselves on both the Martian and Terran side. Simply put, the show exhibits a war that is built by tension, executed by actions, and splashed onto the screen to show us what the consequences are. Still, characterization of a few select characters are memorable and makes us want to get to know more on both sides. There are credible themes involved that pushes the boundary of more than simply winning battles. And to top it all, the technical front of both artwork and soundtrack strikes out with strong impressions. In a way, Aldnoah Zero is a strange show with a curveball that balances itself between story and characters. It\u2019ll just take patience to get to know each other well.\\n\\n\r\nSeason 2 has been confirmed as the split-cour and to be honest with that ending, you better be in it for this wild ride.\\n",

            "content": "Hype, hype, hype. If one show received a huge ton of it this season, it was A-1 Pictures' Aldnoah.Zero. But is it as great as all the big names and the hype make it out to be? Well... not really, but it certainly was a good watch. Thanks for reading my review on Aldnoah.Zero!\r\nThe show takes place in an alternate reality, in which the Apollo 17 mission discovered a hyper gate to Mars on the surface of the Moon in 1972. After these events, the astronauts discovered the legendary \"Power of Aldnoah\", which made technology beyond our imagination possible. With this power in their hands,a lot of people settled on Mars, created the Empire of Vers and declared their independency from Earth. After years of conflicts, in 1999, a fight between humanity and the Empire of Vers caused the hyper gate to get destroyed and it took a huge part of the Moon with it, thus \"Heaven's Fall\" began and lots of the debris from the Moon landed on Earth, destroying whole cities and landscapes. Both sides had to take in massive casualties. After 15 years and a long time of ceasefire, the Vers princess was sent to Earth for a peace mission, but it didn't turn out as expected and the princess got assassinated and right after this, the Martian soldiers began to descend from the sky, riding steel giants, intent on exterminating humanity, taking revenge and conquering Earth for themselves once and for all.\\n\\n\r\nSounds pretty epic, huh? Granted, for the most parts the presentation of the show IS really epic, just assisted and maximized by Hiroyuki Sawano's fantastic soundtrack. While the plot concept sounds quite interesting, the execution is rather meh to say the least. This starts off with some pretty obvious info and exposition dumps and a rather predictable story layout in the beginning; new Martian super robot shows up, kills a lot of people, protagonist beats super robot with a \"clever\" tactic, the end. The show offers some plot twists here and there to keep you engaged, but they somewhat lack depth and impact for the most part, which really was a shame. This is mostly the fault of the anime's characters, as these are obviously the show's biggest downside.\\n\\n\r\nThe main protagonist Inaho is your typical \"2cool4u\" smart hero a l\u00e1 Lelouch, except that Lelouch actually has an understandable and relatable personality for the most part AND charisma. Inaho doesn't have that. A friend dies in front of his eyes; cool and straight face. He beats a bad guy's awesome robo; cool and straight face. He just saved someone's life and they are thanking him; cool and straight face. He is ice cold in whatever he does and this is what makes him distant and in my opinion completely unlikeable and unbearable as hell. I know he doesn't show his emotions from the outside and rather in his actions, but come on. Unrelatable and poorly written!\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast was average at best, with the best ones being Lieutenant Marito and Slaine Troyard. In the Lt.'s case his backstory of the war before the show started was really interesting to watch and how he had to deal with his PTSD, because he lost a precious friend to him back then. That's a more realistic depiction of PTSD compared to... other shows this season *cough* Sword Art Online II *cough*. Sometimes during the show, I wished he was the protagonist instead of Inaho, because he felt a bit more human. But of course, they didn't do anything with him, wasted potential. Slaine Troyard on the other hand was not that bad. He had an somewhat understandable motivation for doing what he does, his backstory was quite interesting - even if presented poorly. Compared to other shows he may still be meh at best, but together with the Lt. they made the otherwise trashy and forgettable cast of Aldnoah.Zero somewhat bette, but that doesn't say much. All in all the characters felt very flat, unengaging, plot-devicey and unlikeable.\\n\\n\r\nThe villains were mostly one-dimensional, cartoony cardboards, with little screentime or focus put on them and the rest of the supporting cast was either not really worth mentioning or spoiler territory.\\n\\n\r\nBut I could overlook some of the writing flaws and the characters for the sometimes godly action sequences. Yeah, the robots are made with 3DCG and tend to not blend in with the background well, but the action A-1 Pictures presented was mostly jaw dropping in my opinion, especially in episode 3 and the finale episode. And yes, I know that the \"tactics\" rival those from Code Geass, but if you turn your brain off and just embrace the action with Hiroyuki Sawano's masterful Original Score in the background, you can probably ignore those flaws as well and just enjoy the show. Of course the flaws wont disappear, but at least it makes it all the more enjoyable. Well, at least for me.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of visuals, Aldnoah.Zero looks really good and for the most part solid as well. The backgrounds are very detailed, the action is smooth and the colors bright. It only took me a while to get used to the kind of blobby character designs and especially in episode 10 there was a huge noticeable drop in animation quality. But thank god it was just for this one episode and the final episodes looked as amazing as they should.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I had a good time with the show and I looked forward to it almost every week. Probably it was the hype getting me fired up every time the fantastic OP by Kalafina started playing, but Aldnoah.Zero was one of the few shows of the season I really wanted to watch. The start was quite dull, then it got better for a long period of time, then it slightly dropped and the nice final episode made up for it. I know, it was mostly SHOCK FACTOR and Urobutcher being Urobutcher (well, Boku no Pico man trying to be Urobutcher), but the way the emotions of certain characters  came across really made my blood boil, but not completely in a good way. It somehow reminded me of Code Geass... weird, a lot of Code Geass comparisons in this review.\\n\\n\r\nWell, time for the verdict.\\n\\n\r\nDid I like Aldnoah.Zero? Sure, I did. Do I think it's a great show and everyone should watch it? Nah, no way. While you can (and most likely will) enjoy it as a brainless watch for tons of good looking and sounding action scenes, it falls flat in terms of good, consistent writing, offering a plot with at least some depth and even mediocre characters. Just don't take this show too seriously and embrace it as the stupid fun it is. Exactly as it was with Code Geass. DON'T PRETEND IT'S SMART!

            "content": "Great story, great art, great sound...questionably well played character development? Possibly.  Regardless, Aldnoah.Zero will probably be seen as an instant favorite to most anime lovers. It makes sure to get you attached, but not too attached to characters, and I put much emphasis on the 'too.'  Nevertheless here's my review continue to read to see if this show is for you. \r\nStory: 10/10\r\nI give this anime the benefit of the doubt strictly due to the fact that it was deeply implied that a season two would be coming, most likely this is the case. In fact as far as story is in generalit was very thrilling and can easily keep a viewer hooked even without the complete enjoyment of the person watching.  To be completely honest it was story that was seemingly most emphasized and because may have lacked in some other topics concerning this anime which will be discussed. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation, art, mechas, everything concerning this topic is well done, in fact other than some questionable angles and on occasion facial expressions, it is hard for me to dislike anything about this topic. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis topic is almost directly related to sound, perfection. From Aldnoah.Zero we get a visually stunning show as ear pleasing one.  The soundtrack that plays throughout the show greatly complements the battle sequences and mood no questions asked.  Even the sound effects concerning the show, whether it be action or casual in the scene, is good. No qualms should be met here. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned in the story topic, this anime does so well in so many criteria that is bound to be lacking even a little bit in something.  In Aldnoah.Zero we see a major emphasis on getting the story moving in earlier episodes but get very little in terms of character development.  In fact what can arguably be called the protagonist turns out to be one of the least interesting characters up til the end of the show. The viewer will no doubt be interested in other characters the story introduces because the are being more 'human'.  As an added note however this does play better for the story criteria, the show will make like certain characters and either pull a R.R. Martin, or make feel a little betrayed. HA! Focused character development can play with emotions, and for that I give the Character criteria a courteous score. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall I would call this show a very good anime, and I look forward to any progression in the story.   At the very least a season two, which the show so kindly introduced, will be very greatly desired.  Keep up the good work!",

            "content": "Out of an era where average Joe protagonists are given extremely powerful mechs to slaughter trained evil soldiers comes Aldnoah.Zero. What this show does to the mecha genre is ingenious. Instead of \"super badass op mech\" being the star of the show, have the trained soldiers systematically take down their overpowered opponents using strategy and planning. On top of this, Gen Urobuchi's setup of the story and his writing of the major events in the series are entertaining as usual. This show is a fantastic subversion of common tropes in mecha shows from years ago.\r\nStory- 8/10\r\nThe setup and world building of A/Z is well done.The first episodes are a great hook for the rest of the show by using shock and awe to portray how crazy the scale is. Nuking a major city on the first episode is guaranteed to at least catch your attention and make you curious about the possible resolutions to this huge conflict. \\n\\n\r\nThe split story-telling between our two protagonists, Slaine and Inaho, kept the show interesting. During calm periods in Inaho's story, something happens to Slaine, and vice versa. \\n\\n\r\nA major issue with the story however is that the big beefed up mechs are often beaten using coincidences or convenient plot devices. Some enemies are defeated in a more logical manner, while some lean closely to the \"asspull\" part of the gradient.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSave for Inaho, all of the characters feel real, likable, and relatable. Their relations, wants, needs, dislikes, goals, and personalities help bring you into the world of A/Z. Save for a few instances where a person snaps to help advance the main plot or a subplot, the characters all act rationally and use logic and strategy to the best of their abilities.\\n\\n\r\nThe common pacifist princess trope, Asseylum, is subverted into a character who detests war, but understands the necessity to fight back. Instead of being weak and worthless while crying about the war, Asseylum goes active as a part of a few operations over the course of the story. \\n\\n\r\nInaho, the highly trained Terran soldier, is an extremely hit or miss character. His emotionless efficiency was highly entertaining, but in a show where all the characters are well written and realistic, his presence slightly takes away from the atmosphere of the show. \\n\\n\r\nLastly, Slaine is the Terran who serves Asseylum and was initally with her at the beginning of the story. He is the irrational, impulsive, and emotional counterpart to Inaho's inability to care about anything. The differences in situation and Slaine's personality create a lot of duality in the story, which I really enjoyed.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation- 8/10. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is fluid, but there are a couple issues. A/Z doesn't really try anything new or eye-catching, simply resorting to the solid, fluid animation that we see in most anime today. The CGI mechs fit into the scene much more smoothly than many other shows, but it still doesn't quite feel right to see an animated character next to a CGI mech. The only other issue is that once or twice, it's difficult to understand what exactly happened on the screen until the character explain it for you, due to some chaotic moments passing by extremely quickly.\\n\\n\r\nSound- 10/10\\n\\n\r\nIt's rare for an OST to be the anchor that solidified such a high score for an anime many were underwhelmed by, but the fact of the matter is that this show has some of the best musical accompaniment I've ever had the pleasure of listening to. Combat scenes had excellent combat music. Psychological scenes had excellent psychological music. Tense situations had either no music or even better psychological music. I could go on and on but my point stands that this show's music is exceptional. \\n\\n\r\nOverall- 9/10\\n\\n\r\nWith the action scenes, well written characters, jaw-dropping OST, and interesting compelling war story, this show is extremely well done. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a war-time action show, mecha lover or not. This is not quite my anime of the season, but for what it's worth, it came pretty damn close.",

Once the war was over, the people of Earth realized that it lacked the weaponry for a potential second war.  It was during the fifteen years of peace that Earth began to advance in machinery and technology.  This advancement led to the development of giant Mechas.\r\nNow, in present day, our hero, Inaho (aka, \u201cEmotionless Boy/Gary Stu\u201d)spends time with his friends and sees the arrival of Princess Asseylum (aka, \u201cPrincess Pain in the Ass\u201d).  Meanwhile, our second \u201chero\u201d, Slaine (aka, \u201cTragic Boy/That F**k Up Boy\u201d) remains on the Vers spaceship, looking down at Earth with a sad face.  Suddenly, while Inaho and his friends watch the princess\u2019 arrival, a terrorist group assassinates the \u201cprincess\u201d (p.s. she\u2019s alive) and the Vers Empire retaliates.

            "content": "Before I start this review I wanted to let you know that I want to focus more of my time on the character portion of this show mainly because that is this shows biggest drawback. I will briefly go over the story, art, sound, and my overall enjoyment and score. But again I will be focusing more on the characters in this review. \r\nStory: Aldnoah.Zero is an obvious homage to the gundam series and it succeeds in creating very cool and interesting action scenes. This shows story is simple yet there are a lot of factors surrounding it that make is unique in it's ownright. In short words the story is good enough to keep you watching until the end but it isn't going to please everyone. \\n\\n\r\nArt: The art aside from the action sequences with the CGI, is very simplistic. The art I felt was perfect for the show. Especially the colors they chose. The colors in the art can be vibrant but also bleak and it adds to the show depending on the story. In short the art makes the show more enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nSound: This is by far the best part of Aldnoah.Zero. I loved every part of the soundtrack. I would definitely buy the OST and listen to it on a daily basis. The songs range from high octane vocals, to powerful orchestral pieces, as well as the calm and soothing songs that fit well and make the viewing experience an absolute blast. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Okay this is where it's going to get quite long. Now I want to get out that I feel as though the writers wanted to take these characters somewhere and wanted to have some depth, but that's all they really were, wants, and wishes. These characters are just boring empty shells that try to be this deep and complex character when they aren't. I specifically want to talk about Inaho as I believe contrary to almost everyone saying that he is the best character, Inaho is the worst character ever written in anime. Now that is taking it a stretch but I can't help but think that it's true. The writers were lazy, and didn't do anything with a character that showed promise. Inaho is just another typical badass silent type character. There are so many questions left unaswered that makes me just not care about Inaho. Why is he so good at that? Why is he so good at this? Why can he do this but nobody else can't? Why can this Highschool student do this? It's extremely pathetic and unacceptable that writers are just spoon feeding this crap to us. I felt no connection, and sympathy from him as a character. You can tell that the writers just want to do something with him but they just aren't doing anything. I believe that this is partially us, the anime communities fault. Instead of wanting well-written characters that have personalities, morals, and actual backstory we just want a badass character who pulls all the girls. Inaho was literally just used to push the plot forward and act on his own accord. Pretty much all the other side characters are equal with Inaho in every aspect, and when a supposed main character is about as interesting as a empty boring side character you have failed. Inaho has potential, but I found him to be the hardest thing to watch. In short I disliked Inaho as a character the most. The princess was also pathetically written, again other than having no reason in the story other than making it convenient for Inaho and the other people to proceed throughout the story in a boring one-dimensional way. \\n\\n\r\nNow there is a whole controversy with Slaine that has the anime community in a huge divide. I found that Slaine was the only decently well written character. He showed emotion, he went through hardships we got to see why he cares so much for characters, and we get to see him, grow as a character which makes me actually care for him. A lot of people tend to just hate on Slaine without really thinking about the things that he as a character has gone through and don't consider his standing on things. Instead he get's hated on by the community because he did something at the end that people didn't like. Slaine was written as a character that acts on emotions. It's extremely obvious that after being shot down by Inaho, for no good reason in an earlier episode, even after swooping down and helping him that he would not be on good terms with Inaho. Slaine shows some depth as a character and more promise than any other character in this show. Another descent character with potential is that one soldier guy who's friend died. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This show has it's moments, and when they happen they're an awesome spectacle. But I can't help but not enjoy this show because of how poorly the characters are done. You know the most important aspect of the show? \\n\r\nThis show had so much potential and it still might, due to there being a second season airing now. But this first season I can't help but say that I had a hard time watching it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: I find myself getting angry because this medium called anime that I grew up with is constantly getting worse. I grew up watching animes like Cowboy Bepop, Lupin the Third, and although those shows are from way back, \"The anime industry is changing\" isn't a valid excuse as to why we are getting crappy anime year after year. Aldnoah.Zero is a letdown overall. I wanted to enjoy this series, and occasionally I did, but it does so much wrong that I can't recommend it to anyone unless you are looking for a mech anime because you've seen every single other mech anime out there.",

            "content": "I hereby make another review co'z some pinche mod had a lot to say about my previous review, so, time to get down to business again.\r\nStory: First of all, the plot where it involves aliens invading earth was indeed pretty overrated, also, the theme of the anime was based on the classic Martian invasion. However, the scenario where, Princess Vers was able to escape from an assassination was pretty darn good to say the least and her wish to stop the invasion also adds to some good in it, even so, imo it wasn't enough that this anime's story would have a high score, soI'm gonna limit it to a 6.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Ok, so the art was the usual, I could have given it a 5, but after seeing how poor Princess Asseylum Vers Allusia and Rayet Areash shower scene, I've decided to limit it to a 4 and that's that, since I haven't seen some any good fanservice of the 2.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: I just like the opening theme and Princess Asseylum's cutsy voice, so a 7 for this part.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Now, I like the way Princess Asseylum was portrayed as this peace loving martian who some how was able to cheat death and Inaho for being this smartass who can operate a  Kataphract  and was able to kick them martians ass, however, the two mentioned characters where somewhat of a double standard, why? At first we saw the Princess who somehow was capable of hand to hand combat , but was unable to defend herself from Rayet's attack, we also see Inaho who was a good tactician, but  was unable to anticipate Slaine's assault. Also, we have Slaine, though at first we would have sympathize with him for being a Martian who was being bullied by the nobles, we were surprise that he is an earthling after all, but the biggest disappointment about him was despite of the maltreatment from the martian noble, he still sided with them. Basically his character was a surprise for us, now having mention the double standard portrayal of Princess Asseylum and Inaho, and the thing about Slaine, was basically the reason why I give this part a 6.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Because, it was the usual alien invasion kind of thing  based on a classic premise and it was more of a mini series than an episode, I would have dropped it already, but there is still that side of this anime where humans where able to win in the end and this is what kept me from dropping it, so I'm gonna give this part a 6.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Though, I gave the enjoyment part of this anime a 6, there were some question as to why original creator Gen Urobuchi gave this anime the title \"Aldnoah Zero,\" all we know is that it powers up the mech and the spaceship that them martians used, however we were left wondering as to what exactly is the \"aldnoah\" thingy, also, the synopsis of the anime stated that the martians were in fact humans who somehow discover some hyper-gate to Mars and when humans went there, they also discover advance alien tech, such synopsis basically puts a lot of plot holes in this anime as a whole,  now if some humans did migrated to mars and become martians, how the fuck can they have developed a kind of monarchical culture within a span of 15 years? Also, if humans where indeed able to discover advance alien tech, then surely earth would have also have access to it and develop such alien tech that would put them at par with the martians, having said that I'm gonna give this anime a 3. Now since this is only the first season, I wonder if we're ever gonna see Princess Asseylum  again? Also, there is no doubt that Saline is gonna be the next antagonist, but that's just my wild guess and not a spoiler. Now, I may have given this anime's overall a 3, but it doesn't mean that the rating applies to season 2, I hope we're clear.\\n\\n\\n\r\nHere are my rating post of this anime:\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fair 6\\n\r\nArt: Decent 4.\\n\r\nSound: Good 7.\\n\r\nCharacter: Fair 6.\\n\r\nEnjoyment Fair 6.\\n\r\nOverall: Poor 3.",

            "content": "Story - 9\r\nAldnoah.Zero is A-1 studios first attempt at a mecha anime. Though the plot is somewhat common, a group of individuals decide to fight against a stronger opposing force, in this case it\u2019s a civil war between Earth and a more technologically advanced Mars. The pace of the story is well done with back stories and exposition placed throughout the series in small amounts. The individual elements in the story are interesting and well worth watching. Each episode is unique and executed nicely with new twists every episode.\r\n\tEarth, having being devastated by Heavens Fall 15 years ago, sets up the plot for ongoing events.Tensions having risen for the past couple years between Earth and Mars a war begins to arise when the Princess of Mars arrives on Earth. Aldnoah.Zero follows the events of these characters throughout the war.\\n\\n\r\nArt \u2013 9\\n\r\nThe visuals are well done, creating unique characters and designs to distinguish between each opposing side. The technology and mecha are unique and are never the same. In addition, the use of color and lighting throughout the show gives the viewers a definite understanding of the devastation that has occurred in the past as well as the battles occurring in the present. Each scene was well drawn and directed including even the smallest of details, and the CGI used was not too overbearing. Character designs were well done each having a unique persona that represents themselves. The quality of animation presented by A-1 studios is definitely top tier.  \\n\\n\r\nSound \u2013 10\\n\r\nAldnoah.Zero features an absolutely amazing soundtrack and other various accompaniments that improve each scene by giving it more depth, even mediocre scenes are made great by inserting the OST into specific places. The music was well composed and directed by Sawano, Hiroyuki. Having directed several other series such as Guilty Crown and Kill la Kill. He makes excellent use of the music placed throughout the series. \\n\r\nThe opening song is also noteworthy being performed by Kalfina, the same people who sang the ending for Fate/Zero. Though I rarely pay attention to most music in the background, the music in this series stood out, sending out chills during battle scenes and other important scenes throughout the series. Having implemented a wide variety of sounds and styles used throughout the series, Aldnoah.Zeros soundtrack is very pleasing to the ear and definitely worth paying attention to throughout the series. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter \u2013 9\\n\r\nThe characters in this series are particularly interesting to keep an eye on. Inaho being one of my favorite MC this season, due to the fact that he uses his brain in contrast to the various other MC found in anime. Slaine also provides a unique perspective to the story. And the final MC Vers Allusia is a unique character that becomes the catalyst for all events in the story. The characters introduced throughout this series come from wide variety of backgrounds each providing a unique perspective to the story. We have characters ranging from being born on Earth, princess of mars and an Earthling raised my Martians. Each characters represent a different side of the story, the characters are well thought out and executed to play each specific role. The character development is well planned out and we learn more about them as the series progresses.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9\\n\r\nAldnoah.Zero was a great mecha series and one of my favorites of the summer season. The character Inaho was one of my favorite protagonist, not driven by emotions, but rather by pure thought. In addition the combination of great music as well as an interesting plot makes this an amazing anime. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9\\n\r\nAldnoah.Zero is a wonderful addition to the mecha genre, with unique characters and designs. This series was one of the most enjoyable of the season. Each element from sound, artwork and story were well executed. As well as including twists in each episode Aldnoah.Zero has been a wonderful anime to watch.\\n",

            "content": "In all fairness I thought that Aldnoah.Zero was a 7/10 anime throughout the whole series. I was pumped to watch the next episode, I thoroughly enjoyed the fight scenes and the artwork was almost at a level of perfection, but my overall was dropped because of the way the story was executed and played out throughout this anime.\r\nAt first I thought that the plot would fill up a fair bit of the anime instead of being based purely on the fight scenes and the war itself, yet I was slightly lead to disappointment in that component. \r\nThe part of the story which really threw thisanime out of place was most definitely the ending...  I genuinely believed that the ending was going to go smoothly and it would be all hunky dory, but then I was hit by a tsunami which crushed every bone in my body. It was by far one of the more horrible anime endings! I won't go into detail to explain why I thought the ending was horrible, but it was definitely a shocker in my eyes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I thought Aldnoah.Zero was an anime which had potential, but it just wasn't executed properly. I recommend watching Aldnoah.Zero, but brace yourself for the ending and the disaster of a story since they were the one of the biggest let downs you will ever face in anime.\\n\\n\r\nDon't hate me if you disagree, this is just my personal opinion.\\n\\n\r\nEDIT: I changed it from a 9/10 to a 7/10 because I felt as if a 9 was too high for this anime.\\n",

            "content": "Aldnoah Zero, the anime that broke my faith in Gen Urobuchi. Well, maybe just broke in a way that it can be glued back together, not shattered into dust. But yes, it did do some serious damage to my faith in the man and his writing ability (or rather, his plus the dude who wrote everyone's favorite anime recommendation, Boku no Pico.)\r\nI can't remember the last time I saw such boring, uncompelling characters. See, usually there's a reason, usually revealed through backstory, flashback, or infodump, about why a lead character would just mutter, \"Oh, a missile's coming\" the way you or I would say wesaw an interesting bird or car while walking down the street, the way our hero Inaho does in episode 1. We see his almost autistic state of mind helps him to keep his head cool in battle and devise Rube Goldbergesque strategies against the invading Martians. But like I said, non-autistic people tend to have some reason for this, and guess what. We're never given any reason why he acts this way. And given his ridiculous plot armor and damn near invincibility against what should be an unstoppable Space Nazi blitzkrieg (and for the first three episodes, the ones actually written by our headlining \"FROM THE CREATOR OF MADOKA MAGICA\" writer, it actually is) a rather fitting description comes up for Earth's Defender: Autistic Kirito. (And even then Kirito was at least given some justification for why he preferred to work alone.) It certainly doesn't help that after those three episodes have passed, the \"invincible\" Space Nazis suddenly start acting like typical mutton-headed villains of the week (or, well, like Hitler himself and his high command after Stalingrad), whom you wonder how they could have conquered their own underwear that morning, let alone their hated former home planet.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that of course brings you to the given backstory. Alien technology found on the last Apollo mission in 1972, including a stargate to Mars? Hey, it's science fiction. Humans have a (somewhat) functioning colony of several thousand on Mars by the '90s? Perhaps stretching things a bit, but remember those ancient astronauts. (Maybe that's how the Kyubeys got here. Maybe those ancient Martians WERE the Kyubeys, dun dun DUN!) The colonists gain magic powers via the alien technology? Still somewhat okay, I guess. By 1999 the colonists start to think of themselves as a racially superior separate species, including to some of their own living relatives back on Earth? (Even as of 2015, most of you reading this have some relatives who were alive in 1972, right? My own dad was 17 that year, the same age I was in '99! And his dad died in 2006, so even if he'd gone up into space at some point, taken some of that Kyubey tech...you get the picture.) As some other reviewers have opined, I might be able to see situation like that at least a thousand years down the road, but not 27. And then they blow up most of the moon, sending the fragments crashing down and devastating most of the continents (but largely sparing Japan for SOME reason). ...Yeah, we'd all be dead. The moon itself actually formed in a similar fashion, when a planet collided with Earth. It literally blasted off the young Earth's entire crust. Point is, even if the admittedly smaller moon fragmented and collided with Earth, chances are the effects would be much worse than even large bays where Los Angeles and Perth used to be.\\n\\n\r\nBut I could've forgiven this eye-rolling setup if only the characters hadn't all been buckets of dishwater, and the villains in the same caliber as Master Butterfly from SAO (IE, cackling obviously evil types whom you almost expect to should \"Curses! Foiled AGAIN!\" as Autistic Kirito sends them tumbling to their deaths). By the long-awaited end, well, you probably won't care in the least what happens to them, but you may find yourself asking, \"how, how in the name of O-Madoka-sama do you go from, well, Madoka to...THIS in just three years?\" Even Shyamalan, to whom Gen is often compared these days, had a five-year run before audiences started turning against him with The Village. Well, as Gen's defenders point out, he only wrote the first three episodes and provided a scant outline of the characters and plot points, the same tactic he used Gargantia to somewhat similar results. ...Yeah, you'd have to be blind to miss that pattern. Gen's relatively small involvement in both shows didn't stop Aniplex (and Kadokawa for Gargantia) from plastering \"FROM THE CREATOR OF MADOKA MAGICA\" on all the promos. It's certainly not the first time it's been done in anime or any entertainment (George Lucas and Howard the Duck, back when Lucas was still widely respected; John Travolta in the Quaaluded Moment By Moment), but it's still depressing as hell to see such a promising writer seeming to make the bait-and-switch his main career strategy (if it's a hit, sasuga Urobutcher; if it tanks, h-he only wrote the first few episodes, anta baka). At Shyamalan writes his scripts in their entirety on those occasions when he can find work.",

            "content": "Aldnoah the rip off by this Urobutcher'd Review:\r\nMINDSET:\r\nThe causals soon encounter the best mix of some of the most amazing staff members, we have the same script director of Boku no Pico (ok, lets ignore that one) We have the 3 legendaries of Anime script writing: Ei Aoki, the Urobutcher and Jin for the music, (who is better than Yujikadra) have now joined forces to become the Asian Writers League! The amazing trio of gangsters are in the midst on making the best Anime for your friends, your familly, your pets, your grand parents, your teacher, your ex-girlfriend and even the prostitute You picked up5 years ago!\\n\\n\r\nSYNOPSIS:\\n\r\nApparently Martians come down from the moon to kill people, for apparently \u201cFood and Culture\u201d but the biggest difference between whats a human (Terran) and a martian is that despite that they both look alike, the martians are a technological advance species whose only difference is that they can breath in space and that they can operate a super over powered mechas known as \u201cAldnoah\u201d for the few who can operate such a machine has high status from their political ladder, while the Terrans just have these misely little mechs who apparently wield giant machine guns, the martians land down to Earth to declare war for chances of them to fulfil more food and culture on to themselves.\\n\\n\r\nREVIEW:\\n\r\nFirst off, the protagonist may show little to know mercy and is completely OP but is utterly lifeless, like You see his friend dying at the first episode and he doesn\u2019t even change he's expression! He has no personality, at all, which makes him boring and the audience to not care. Ladies and gentlemen, I present to You a story that is purely of lazy, choppy and sometimes predictable piece of horrendous writing from this uncanny valley from these retards that created Aldnoah.\\n\\n\r\nRight at the first episode, it may not be predictable, but it always seemed so into the face when I see at how \u201cMoronic\u201d Urobutchi and he's Boku friend  can pull out so many forced plot points.\\n\\n\r\nSure, the story is unpredictable, but all I see is a bunch of unpredictable ass pulls! Like You see this one dimensional villain going all we need to capture planet Earth so we can have more food, then a few episodes later, he dies, but another villain just taken he's place and its like You can just let the first main villain to not exist at all. Which makes so, sooo many characters completely useless other than being a backdrop or being used for future plot holes that are forcefully coming out of nowhere.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing that motivated me on watching the later episodes was the the premise seemed interesting. It has a lot of potential to be one of those greats. But of course, this is a \u201cPopular\u201d modern Anime with loads of hype surrounding it so I can already predict a sh*t storm narrative miles away, but if it really needs to strive to be greater, it must be more respectful towards its audience and show depths of realism and especially not pull out any plot devices out of the forced dimension! (and a million other jazz) and consequently, this \u201cever\u201d happens to mainstream shows.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of how utterly useless a large portion on what actually seemed to be the \u201cMain Cast\u201d the characters don't really have much use at all, there often the 20% who are taking action, or the 80% who barely have a role to the story and are just there for plot convenience, like how these teenagers who are friends with the protagonist who you could think they have loads of screen time for supporting the protagonist, but are really just there to operate whatever machine the good guys use. They are really just  a majority of characters like these who feel just as lifeless and uncared for as the main, yeah, You may counter saying that he changes facial expressions, or boast at how OP he is and that he's like one of the Earth biggest hope for survival but there is clearly nothing to explore his context, his nature, back story, personality, motives and just feels like an empty shell that simply reacts with only having the complexity of damn Smurf! The 99.9% of this side cast is stupid writing. Period.\\n\\n\r\nThe shows logic feels completely stupid, I already went through enough pain by how forced fed we are by the plot, but is'nt this supposed to be part of a massive planetary war against humans and martians and jazz? Then how come we could really accept the realism if there just a bunch of teenagers? Oh wait, its because they flipping sell. (DUUUUHHH)\\n\\n\r\nWhen You think about a full on Sci-Fi war against two divided races, there has to be some good tension that will provide a higher level of entertainment and satisfactory, but so many of the issues of the show can all be pointed at the claim that its just too forced. Plot holes can be thrown out of nowhere and be patched up with a BS explanation that forces us to accept it as actual logic, Side characters are plot devices, the so-called \u201cEpic Twist\u201d feel rather unnatural and downright moronic, characters get barely to no development and it all feels like a large mess for no one to even care or mind about. This show is without a doubt one of the best examples of how much Urobuchi makes stuff up, and makes them look more like plot devices than actual characters!\\n\\n\r\nYes, Slain seems to be the only good character unlike the pussies who just sit there and do nothing but sob for reasons we don't care about and he actually takes action with a reasonable motive, though he can be a bit corny, he still is a million times better than everyone else. However, one character cannot suffice a million other horrible ones, and they might as well all go to a hentai  and the show is probably better if Princess Seylum was tentacle'd by the evil knight leaders because I don't care, and she's protected by plot armour. And she is almost a plot device character!\\n\\n\r\nActually, did anyone notice that in the OP  when You see Seylum lying on a small puddle that her bra was off when we see her whole body on a birds eye view, or was it me? Well, the music is pretty damn good, though it is pretty sad that I don't get to hear the OST alone in my own pleasure for free, but at least the OP still retains that Kalafina awesomeness we all love, though additively it is starting to feel like that same exact style going to repeated over and over again, with the usual electric guitar and piano into the mix, with that amazing voice that I won't seem to actually get bored of until another a year or two.\\n\\n\r\nA-1 Pictures does seem to understand how to animate a damn good looking show, but this is 2010's so what do You expect the narrative substance would be? Any how, the slightly varied designs feel quite lazy, characters don't tend to have memorable designs which Perfectly blends in on being plot devices, and its like You can simply tell which character plays a larger role if they seem to have a slight variation of hair colour or the fact that she's \u201cPrettier\u201d than the reset of the girls. Mecha designs kind of suck around the latter parts like that wierd tripod who can only shoot lasers, but, I do see effort and creativity with these massive legged robots and I am definitely no mecha fan boy nor I find the designs hugely appealing, but they are real good for what there worth, and the budget seems very consistent with the action scenes looking really cool. The strategies feel a bit stupid with the teenagers just doing all the dirty work, but the choreography and overall feel of the Animation and show in general makes for a fairly immersive experience in a visual stand point. The CGI looks stupid BTW.\\n\\n\r\nLEGACY:\\n\r\nAnd this is why we don't use the script director of Yaoi hentai to make proper sh*t up! Just love it from the garnishing of the Animation and to see how utter retard this team of producers cen get. I'd be bored out of my mind watching such a horrible show, though because of how turd the hype was it is a very, very bloody endeavour for me to anti-forget such a show from that over killing hype... Hopefully I'll forget it once I die.\\n\\n\r\nSCORES:\\n\r\n2.5/10 \u2013 The characters are stupidly pointless\\n\r\n3/10 \u2013 The story is just an entire assh pull!\\n\r\n7/10 \u2013 Great animation, but corny CGI.\\n\r\n7/10 \u2013 Kalalalalalalafina!\\n\r\n2.5/10 \u2013 ONE OF IF NOT, THE MOST BORING SHOW OF SUMMER 2014.\\n\\n\r\nFINALE: 3/10 \u201cLet justice be done, though the heavens fall....\u201d Thats it! Now Your just making stuff up for everyone to awe at for a lousy quote that might as well say \u201cDirected by Boku No Pico, now shut the hell up and give me money!\u201d",

            "content": "[Adapted From Original Blog Post]\r\nExpectation, for anything really, is a really dangerous thing to have when going to any anime. I may have made this point before, but that's because it's true, starting an anime with the mindset that it will either be amazing or crap can influence your opinion on it when it ends. The problem with this of course is that you may lose sight of how good the show actually is; this is a common problem with the landmark anime like Cowboy Bebop or Neon Genesis Evangelion, it's because they are so hyped up that some people may watch them and thinkthey weren't all that great. This may be a trap I have fallen into myself with my viewing of Aldnoah.Zero, the latest brainchild of Gen Urobuchi that aired this past 2014 Summer anime season, and was possibly one of my most hyped anime of the entire year. And why not? This is a show that had absolutely everything going for it; an interesting premise, awesome animation, a top-notch writer, and music that features easily some of the most pulse-pounding awesome songs this year. But after I finished Aldnoah.Zero last week, I leaned back from my monitor, pondered for a moment, and thought, \"where'd did it all go wrong?\" Hopefully today, I can answer because that question. It just might be a little hard, since I can't deny the little things the anime does right.\\n\r\n     Hello people of \"The Wired\", my name is Quan, I hope you're doing awesome, and I'm sorry about the month anime review hiatus I've been on. Hopefully you've enjoyed the other posts in that time, but I swear it won't be long before the next review: which may or may not have something to Kyoto Animation again. Today I'm going to be tacking the sci-fi mecha quandary that seems to have split opinions with a lot of people: Aldnoah.Zero. Here we go.\\n\\n\r\nLet's talk technical for a couple minutes shall we? Aldnoah.Zero was brought to life by a partnership of both the heavily celebrated A-1 Pictures, those gentleman whose works include Sword Art Online, Anohana and Shinsekai yori, as well as the newly formed Studio TROYCA, meaning that Aldnoah.Zero stands right now as their only full-scale work. It was directed by the one and only Ei Aoki, that awesome person who directed Kara no Kyoukai: Overlooking View and Fate/Zero, as well as a couple others that I don't care to mention due to their unimportant nature. And yes, that's not a good thing. The series creator is of course Gen Urobuchi, the writer who brought us Madoka Magica, Psycho-Pass and Fate/Zero as well, so you can see why I have a lot of expectation for this guy. However, while Urobuchi did write episodes 1-3 of the anime, the actual script for Aldnoah.Zero was handled by Katsuhiko Takayama, who has written scripts such as ef: A Tale of Memories, the original Fullmetal Alchemist, Toyko ESP...and Boku no Pico...which is interesting to say the least. And once again, the anime aired this summer through July 6 to September 21, and was a mere 12 episodes. Now, onto the plot.\\n\\n\r\nIn an alternate present day Japan, Earth holds an uneasy truce with the Vers Empire, humans who migrated to Mars in 1972 to claim an ancient and powerful technology known only as \"Aldonah\", which allows their technology to forward at an impossibly quick rate, granting things such as mechas. The princess of Vers is intent on rekindling peace between the two planets, now 15 years after a war broke out between Mars and Earth, resulting in thousands dead and the moon being destroyed in a near-apocalyptic event known as Heaven's Fall. However, peace negotiations break down quite quickly as the Vers princess is assassinated, causing the Vers Empire in fury to launch a full scale attack on Earth, this time to destroy all inhabitants and claim the planet with their vastly superior technology granted by Aldnoah. In the chaos we are introduced to our main protagonist: Inaho Kaizuka, a top grade high-school student who, with his friends, misses the first evacuation wave and is caught up along in the chaos of war, but at the same time discoveres a secret that reveals that the war might not be all that it seems. At the same time on Mars, a close friend of the princess named Slaine Troyard is uncovering the same secrets, secrets which could topple the Vers Empire, and get himself killed.\\n\r\n     And yeah, for the first 3 or so episodes the plot is rather effective. The sequence of when the Vars Empire start to descend on Earth and take out all the major cities Independence Day style, paired with the awesome music easily gets my vote for one of the most epic string of scenes for the year, all brought to life by the high quality animation A-1 and TROYCA have provided. We also are introduced to a conspiracy that  a trigger-happy Vers Empire may have killed their own princess as an excuse for a vendetta against Earth, mostly established from Slaine's point of view on the other side of the battlefield. It's also hard not to be intrigued by Inaho's character right off the bat, because even if he seems to have the personality of hand-rag,  he takes down a seemingly invincible enemy mech using pure brain power, and that's kind of cool, at least it is at first. However, after Aldnoah.Zero sets up all these intriguing threads, with mysterious character motivation, conspiracies, and a few plot-twists, it then proceeds to play it safe, and in doing so, quite spectacular loses the most traction and kinetic energy I've ever seen in an anime in such a short amount of time since Mirai Nikki......and we all know how Mirai Nikki turned out. Though to be fair, I'm pretty sure the ending of Aldnoah.Zero is even worse.\\n\\n\r\nThe most frustrating part is that the plot isn't even that bad. The bigger picture of what's actually going on with the war is fairly interesting, but the biggest problem Aldnoah.Zero has is that the cast of characters it has simply aren't likable or well-developed enough to carry the narrative onward, because for me, there wasn't any particular reason why I should care about any of them, especially the main protagonist Inaho who I'm pretty sure has the same blank expression on his face for almost the entire series, even if an angry Martian is about to smash his face in with a mech. Now I know I'm getting ahead of myself here, we'll get to the character section of this review in a minute, but really it's the character's fault that the plot fails. Aldnoah.Zero did half the work if you like, setting a decent story up, but not giving us characters who we want to see it through with. Don't get me wrong, a cast of unlikable characters can sort of, kind of work, but the fact that they're so underdeveloped gives them no saving grace, and just leaves us with a group of thoroughly nasty people. \\n\r\n     Getting back on topic with the plot however, the anime just seems to lose all of its passion after that 3 episode run. As the show progresses, it starts becoming fairly formulaic for a couple of episodes, where a new solider of Vars comes in to attack Inaho and his friends, and then Inaho comes up with some plan to stop said solider, which he does, and rinse and repeat for about 5 episodes or so. And no matter how much the music is trying to tell me whatever is going on is absolutely amazing, I just can't get hyped about whatever is happening when I've seen it happen already, and explained by a protagonist who doesn't really seem to care about it. Granted, I will admit, the first battle sequence in episode 3 is awesome and clever, and even prompts that Inaho might be some kind of unassuming bad-ass, but again, it just happens over and over after that. Not only this, but clich\u00e9s and fanservice start creeping in the mid-to-late stages of the anime, which basically just killed any optimism I had left for the show. I mean come on guys, you made Fate/Zero, you don't need to rely on this crap! Things do start to pick up once the final goal of the story has been established and faith for humanity is restored, because it's here when the action really starts picking up for the show, and for the first time, the show actually begins to gain some structure as the last few episodes start building and building towards this final point. We do also get a kind of lame \"surprise\" villain at this point(I say surprise in quotations because the anime really doesn't make any effort to hide who the bad guy is), but I didn't mind too much because the show was finally starting to peak my interest for the first time since the opening episodes...and then the ending happened. Now, let me get something clear. Yes, I have been known to blow certain things out of proportion in the past, but seriously, I don't exaggerate when I say that the show quite completely falls apart in the final episode, and then pulls a completely out of nowhere ending that just feels like it's there for the shock alone. And yeah it's shocking, but that really doesn't make it any more stupid or just plain lazy writing.\\n\r\n     And you know, it's kind of easy here just to let Urobuchi off the hook here and blame it all on Takayama. After all, the first 3 episodes, the only ones Urobuchi is actually credited with writing, are by far the best of the anime, but he's not completely without blame here. True, it was actually Ei Aoki who came up with a lot of these weak characters, and it was Takayama who is responsible for the poor writing later on in the series, but Urobuchi is, after all, the \"original creator\". He must have had some say in how the plot progressed from those initial episodes, so congratulations guys, Aldnoah.Zero failed, and it's everyone's fault. Well, maybe fail is a strong word. Before I bash on the show too much, particularly in this section coming up, I just wanted to get out there that the plot really isn't all that terrible, and there are a couple good moments in between the beginning and the lead up to the end that are very well done. They just aren't nearly as common as I would hope for. \\n\\n\r\nThis is where Aldnoah.Zero truly fails I'm afraid: the characters, and this is the most obvious with our main character Inaho. You may have noticed I've been taking shots at him already through this review, so it's time to say why I just don't like this guy, and the reason is the most obvious one, a detail you'll pick up quickly after watching him for a couple minutes. No matter what is happening and no matter who is attacking him, Inaho shows practically no emotion at all. He always has this bored look on his face, even when he sees his friends die in front of him in the early episodes. Sure he might grit his teeth for a second when in battle or something, but mostly, he just delivers his lines with no emotion at all, and this just makes him boring in the end. His only defining feature his intelligence, which he uses along with his calm demeanor in battle to take down the enemy, usually with actually smart tactics that you can appreciate. Now, emotionless characters can work, for example Yuki Nagato in The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, as long as their behavior is justified, but with Inaho, we never really learn why he acts like this. Seriously, is this a childhood trauma effecting him? Why is he so emotionally distanced to everything? I never found out. Sure, Inaho might have the occasionally spark of personality when talking to his sister Yuki Kaizuki, but in the end, I spent all of the anime waiting for some kind of emotional outburst from him which never came. I just don't know what the creators are thinking with this character, his only redemption at this point could be a more detailed back-story in the second season of Aldnoah.Zero which will be airing this winter, though judging how the anime ended, that seems a little unlikely.\\n\r\n     As for Slaine Troyard...well I almost hesitate to call him a character rather than a plot device. Why do I say this? Well, as far as I can tell, he only exists in the series for one purpose at the very, very end, I'm talking the last few seconds here, but I'll won't elaborate due to spoilers. I suppose if you take him at face value though, he's a OK character. He's defined by his unyielding loyalty(and possible romantic affection) to the princess of Vers: Asseylum, who he owes everything to due to an event in the past, and yeah, that's basically all his character. Don't get me wrong, I like him to an extent, he's brave and headstrong at the very least, and one of the few people who actually tries to uncover the truth behind the princesses' murder, but yeah, that's all he has going for him. It wouldn't even be so bad if he actually did something throughout the anime, but he's kind of held in limbo for the entire time until the end, where he really has nothing else to do besides question the morality of the war. There is one point in episode 6 where you think he's actually going to meet up with the rest of the plot, but like a dog on a leash he's yanked almost instantaneously to where he was before,  as if the creators are saying: \"no, you're not important until the end, go away.\" Again though, we'll see where his character goes in the sequel.\\n\r\n     I'm a little hesitant to talk about this last character since it is technicality a spoiler for episode 2 of the anime, but she's arguably the best character in the show, and besides, the anime makes no effort to keep this a secret(both the OP and ED especially), but if you really don't want to know anything, you can go ahead and skip this paragraph. Basically though, the twist at the end of episode 2 is that the Vers princess: Asseylum is still alive, a copy being sent in her place on the day of the assassination. As you can imagine, this opens a whole new side to the plot, as the princess goes undercover with Inaho and the rest of the United Earth forces in an attempt to contact her grandfather and stop the war. At first, I thought her a little generic, just a typical perfect princess archetype that only disguising feature was her want for peace between Earth and Vers, but I later found out she's a lot more complex than she first appears. She harbors a strong guilt; blaming herself for the war because it never would have occurred if she had never gone down to Earth for peace talks, and her entire ark is basically her confronting that everything isn't going to work out and not everyone particularity wants peace between the two planets. We see her get increasingly frustrated by the lack diplomatic discussion or effort of both Earth and Vers, which eventually reaches a breaking point near the end of the anime, which I thought was probably the most subtle and best character moment of the show. And hey, she's also pretty awesome with hand-to-hand combat. If there's one thing that doesn't work with her character, it's the implied romance between her and Inaho, which really dies. After all, it's kind of hard to have chemistry between two characters when one of them is basically a robot, and it just doesn't work. It's clear that Slane deserves her if anybody, considering all he goes through throughout the course of the anime just to protect her, including being tortured... though even that's kind of hard to buy since the two only have about two scenes together in the anime. But I digress.\\n\r\n     The rest of the supporting cast is fairly unremarkable, not even having any real standouts. As I said, the villain who enters later isn't really anything to talk about, and the rest of the cast like the rest of the United Earth officers and Inaho's classmates really don't contribute much of anything to the story either. If I had to choose a standout, a sub-plot of sorts involving a retired Earth officer named Koichiro Marito whose struggling with PTSD from the first Vers-Earth war. And yes, while that is fairly interesting, it really doesn't seem to relate to the main story at all besides from giving us some exposition on the events revolving around Heaven's Fall.\\n\\n\r\nAs I've stated before, the animation is awesome. The shows looks amazing, typical of A-1 pictures, and hey, maybe this is a standard we can expect from TROYCA as well in the coming years. The action of the show is fast-paced and exciting, which is good for a show with so much of it. Colors are relatively mellow, yet get more expressive on Mars, where purples and greens start making the world feel a little more surreal, though I feel like the design for the show, especially considering it is sci-fi, could have been a little better. Everything feels a little borrowed from other things, including the shattered moon in the sky which is really supposed to be the anime's identifiable setting center-piece, looks cool, but other more creative measures could have been taken to make the world feel a little more original. But now I'll stop dancing around the topic and address what was undoubtedly one of the biggest controversies animation-wise before this show started airing. Yes, the kataphrakts(which is just a fancy word for mechs) are rendered with CG, which some might view as devil's spawn when paired with typical animation. I will admit I'm not the biggest fan of CG myself, it always looks a little too clunky and out of place when placed in a 2-D environment, and it can break immersion just because of how noticeable it is most of the time. However, while it might take a little getting used to in Aldnoah.Zero, I can say that much for it, you do get used to it and accept it as a part of the show. It doesn't really add anything a typical drawn mech wouldn't have, but it does sort of solve that problem of the world feeling a little uninspired that I mentioned before. However, if you really aren't one who can stand CG, this is going to be a huge problem if you decide to watch the show, because unlike other times when CG has been integrated into anime sparingly, the kataphrakts are a huge part of the show and kind of hard to miss.\\n\\n\r\n Let's talk about Hiroyuki Sawano's music, which at this point, I consider to be some of my favorites of any composer. I mean, just look at this list of prestigious soundtracks he's done: Kill la Kill, Guilty Crown and Attack on Titan, which may I add, are all amazing soundtracks in their own right. And now, I'm delighted to say he hasn't run out of steam quite yet, because Aldnoah.Zero's OST, while it might not be the best he's ever done, is still probably going to be one of the best of the year. Sawano just knows how to make his music sound cool, whether that be by mixing different languages or just adding an epic beat so you love the song regardless. Personal favorites form this soundtrack include a song entitled \"I Say Cry\", which plays during that previously mentioned scene when Vers are first attacking Earth, which yes, I know is everyone's favorite song from this soundtrack, but hey, it's epic. Also, the first ED titled \"A/Z\" is a lovely little song, that was actually co-created by Sawano himself and Mitzuki. The OP for the anime: \"heavenly blue\" was done by Kalafina, and while I like it a lot, I'm just saying it sounds really similar to Fate/Zero's first OP \"oath sign\". That may be because Yuki Kajiura, who is doing the \"theme song arrangement\" for \"heavenly blue\" worked on that OST as well. \\n\\n\r\nAldnoah.Zero is the perfect example of an anime which had too much hype surrounding it when it started, and now I don't think the public majority's opinion of it is that great, now that it has finished airing, which is a shame, because it doesn't deserve(all) the hate it has gotten. I mean, it has great music and animation, bundled with a decent plot, I just think that the characters may have pissed everyone off, not that I blame them. So I'm going to try to remember Aldnoah.Zero in a more positive light, and remember the good things rather than the bad, because there is good in it, and it needs to be acknowledged. You don't need to love it, I don't, but it a little slack. Though rage all you want about the ending, because that was literally the worst. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: 6(.5)/10\\n\\n\r\nP.S: So what, she's died three times now?\\n\\n\\n\r\nFor this review and others, feel free to check out my blog!

            "content": "In a Nutshell:\r\nAldnoah.Zero holds a very special place in my heart, it really does. How one anime can so comprehensively screw up in every department, that actually matters, is beyond me. It is a feat not even the great Koi to Senkyo to Chocolate was able to achieve. So unmitigated is this disaster that I think its required viewing for anyone interested in knowing how NOT to write an anime. Everyone else would probably be better off watching boku no pico.\r\nThe Review:\r\nAldnoah chronicles a war that breaks out over the attempted assassination of the Martian princess, Asseylum, who was on a diplomatic mission to improverelations between the Terrans and the Martians. Tensions between the two factions had apparently been escalating ever since the last war, which purportedly took place 15 years prior the series. This is all the information we get before the anime becomes a tedious string of action sequences, interlaced with uninteresting conversations and nearly useless infodump sections. As a result, we learn barely anything about the political and economic conditions surrounding the conflict. But hey, who gives a damn if the plot is paper thin and has holes the size of Jupiter, as long as there are you have badass explosions, and a cast of high school students to boot!\\n\\n\r\nThe anime focuses on a handful of characters at the expense of all other aspects of the so-called war. So you would think the writers would put at least SOME effort into developing them, right? Heh, WRONG! In fact, Aldnoah has plot devices instead of 'characters.'The biggest problem with the cast is undoubtedly its size. There are simply way too many characters for a 12 episode show to handle properly. As a direct result, most of them end up being extras with no personalities whatsoever. Strangely enough, the 'main' characters don't fair any better. Inaho, the protagonist of this trainwreck, is the most lifeless individual I have seen to date. If he were to be replaced by one of the mechs, you would've have a really hard time telling the difference. This is helped by the fact that the apathetic idiot sounds as if he were voiced by a text-to-speech software. for someone labelled as the protagonist, Inaho doesn't really do much besides delivering exposition during battles. He doesn't even get into a relationship for god's sake! Even the most generic ecchi anime has a lead more human than this bag of bones.\\n\\n\r\nThe Martian side of things is even worse, believe it or not, when it comes to the character department. This entire faction seems to be comprised of disagreeable individuals, who are bent on starting a war with the Terrans. Moe Mars princess, (Asseylum) and Slaine, the Terran who was 'saved' by her, are apparently the only people who have a conscience. Asseylum is clearly the more annoying of the two. The anime tries to portray her as a pacifist, an angel among demons, if you will. This probably could've worked if the writers had bestowed her with an appropriate back story. But as it stands, she's a walking, talking, collection of cliches. Given the princess' fetish for Terrans, I fully expected a relationship to blossom between her and Slaine. But the guy is busy with plot device duties throughout the series, you see. His sole purpose seems to be accentuating the inhumane nature of the Martian gentry, by being repeatedly beaten and tortured. You actually feel sorry for him until you realize it's just too contrived to take seriously. The very notion that he suffers all this abuse right under Asseylum's nose is preposterous. Why couldn't the idiot just go and tell her about his misery. There is absolutely no reason for the dim-witted Terran to suffer in silence. Oh wait, there is, SHOCK VALUE!\\n\\n\r\nAldnoah zero is yet another series which squandered its potential because of lazy writing. It literally offers NOTHING of value in terms of plot and characterization. Not even the flashy visuals and catchy soundtrack can save this one from my shit list.",

            "content": "Graphics/animation\r\nThe overall art design is beautiful, very atmospheric. The only \u201ecriticism\u201d this show usually gets is the use of CGI, but after re-watching those scenes Ill call it good. Apart from a few scenes where the Terran mechs looked really clunky most of the time they were using various tricks to make the robots blend into the background which included the clever use of camera angles, lighting, colors, smoke, snow etc... The show is easy to follow and visually appealing.\r\nMusic\r\nAs many have stated already \u2013 it\u2019s great. Hiroyuki Sawano showed us again what a talented composer he is. But since this is a review aboutthe anime and not the OST I want to talk about how they USED the music in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nUsually the music\u2019s role in a movie or a TV show is to enhance the experience during certain scenes. Problem is when you overuse it you will achieve the exact opposite and take away from the intensity of the scenes. Instead of letting your audiences make the interpretations for themselves about how they should feel (based on the visuals and the sounds) you force feed them with the information by using music.\\n\\n\r\nThe only time when the director showed real restraints were the final scenes in episode 12. This added more depth and emotion to the final showdown which is admirable. Wish the rest of the directing was on par with that (in terms of using the music I mean).\\n\\n\r\nWorldbuilding/war/politics\\n\\n\r\nThis is probably the worst part of Aldnoah Zero. Since the anime is focusing on both sides I was hoping for a show where at least the basics (history, motivations) are done right, but nope. It\u2019s pretty obvious that they wanted to tell us a \u201ecool\u201d invasion story, but put minimal effort into the worldbuilding. I would say if your knowledge about history, politics, economy, social behavior (etc...) is limited to Hollywood movies you can come up with a BS like that, but what we see on screen is disappointing at best (or causes brain aneurysm at worst).\\n\\n\r\nStory/action\\n\\n\r\nAfter the first two episodes it\u2019s quickly established that the Martians are \u201esuper-duper\u201d powerful and the Terran military is pretty much helpless against them on a worldwide scale. This could have been a nice approach if the show was about the desperate fight for survival of the Terrans, but since it\u2019s about them kicking some Martian assess you know that won\u2019t be the case. This time we get a Japanese high school student called Inaho, a genius, who singlehandedly comes up with amazing battle plans to defeat the invaders.\\n\\n\r\nI have to admit it that compared to the \u201ethe-main-character-gets-an-overpowered-robot-for-no-reason-and-beats-everyone\u201d clich\u00e9 this is sort of refreshing, but gets boring really fast. Especially because the more you think about it the more you realize that while his plans look good on paper, based on his observations he could have came up with different conclusions/interpretations. Meaning he is making somewhat logical wild guesses and he turns out to be right every single time.\\n\\n\r\nAnd naturally he is also able to flawlessly execute these plans, because he is an ace pilot who mastered the art of sidestepping instead of standing still and waiting for the fatal blow while screaming like an idiot.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nOverall bland and boring. Only four of them are worth mentioning.\\n\\n\r\nInaho (protagonist) \u2013 The new \"industry standard\" empty shell with some desirable traits (genius, chick magnet etc...) so the average viewer can project his own personality at him and say \"oh hey look he is just your everyday normal person. Just like ME\".\\n\\n\r\nSlaine (protagonist) \u2013 The best written character in the show (most likely unintentionally). Led by hormones and emotions, tossed left and right, naive and easily manipulated. Exactly how most teenagers would react in his situation.\\n\\n\r\nSaazbaum (antagonist) \u2013 The only bad guy in the show who has a reasonable motivation which puts him way above the rest of the cartoony villains. Sadly his reasoning and actions often contradict each other, but considering the overall bad writing he gets a pass.\\n\\n\r\nMarito \u2013 The alcoholic, traumatized war veteran. Since Inaho solves everything his potential gets wasted and remains at the sideline.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nAldnoah zero is basically the anime version of a Hollywood action movie. Just like the majority of the overhyped stuff this one also fits the \"the-more-you-think-about-it-the-more-you-hate-it\" category.\\n\\n\r\nIt has a really catchy premise, some nice action scenes, but on the other hand its full of plot holes, one dimensional characters, plot conveniences, clich\u00e9s, etc..\\n\\n\r\nOverall it\u2019s a very \"effective\" anime that knows its targeted audience, but won't be remembered 10 years from now.",

            "content": "They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, but at what point do we cross the line between paying homage to other works and being a complete ripoff? Many titles have been labeled as copycats or cheap knockoffs before, usually riding the coattails of tentpole entries to gain recognition. Every storytelling medium has this occurrence, and with anime, it's no different. But every once in awhile we get a title that doesn't just copy a well-known property but takes it a step further by copying the definitive title in its respective genre. A public display of pillaging so unforgivable, that in the court ofpublic opinion, it's usually met with disgust and pitchforks in the form of verbal diatribes. Aldnoah.Zero is such a title, a show so full of itself that it didn't just have the audacity to steal the entire Mobile Suit Gundam setup, but it does so without even batting an eye, xeroxing it down to the minute details. \\n\\n\r\nAt times, the changes made were so minuscule that the only thing done was name substitution. The circumstantial evidence of which was so apparent, that by merely reciting the setup of its premise, the tumor-like symbiosis that it shares with the patriarch it draws blood from could still be seen desperately clinging to the surface; bite marks still fresh from where the ideas were directly leeched off from, stopping no short of wholesaling arcs and iconography in its entirety. \\n\\n\r\nMankind is broken into two separate governing factions, with the ones residing in space, the Vers Empire of Mars, treating the inhabitants of earth as inferior relics of their past. With bad-blood still looming over both nations, the people of the Vers Empire finally declares war on their former \"Terren\" brethren once again, after the temporary truce of a fifteen year period of civil unrest was finally brought to an end. With these two nations plunged back into battle, a ragged-tagged group of teens and public servants find themselves swallowed up in the chaos, leading to their boarding of a military vessel, as they pilot mechs and fend off the endless wave of enemy invaders. Poorly trained and doing everything in their power to survive, the only hope left for this motley crew is to seek out the assistance of the Earth's united front, as the fight for dominion over the planet marches forward. \\n\\n\r\nSound familiar? \\n\\n\r\nThe idea of \"paying homage\" quickly topples like a house of cards when the piracy on display is this blatant.\\n\\n\r\nThe fresh coat of \"Vers Empire of Mars\" paint still wet, as it barely covers up the stolen \"Principality of Zeon\" ornament positioned underneath. But try not to wince too much, you need to save your composure for the rebranding of \"newtypes\" as \"Aldnoah users\" and all the subsequent \"borrowing\" yet to come, as the story drags itself down an inevitable path. The impression of reverse engineering can't be ignored, with plot points charted out from lifted passages of other works, the bold outlines of which already taking shape before the actual arc does due to little to no effort placed towards diversifying the formula.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd if that wasn't apparent enough, this is a show that deploys shock factor moments and plot twists, but the obviousness of it being there all long prevents any of it from truly being \"shocking\" in any sense of the word. Like whenever you watch a horror movie and everything cuts to silence while the character's hands grip the side of the bathroom sink, the medicine cabinet left open, and\u2014you guessed it\u2014a jumpscare occurring right after they close the door and the mirror reveals something standing behind them; an act that's usually highlighted by a loud audible stinger. You may have involuntarily been spooked at those scenes in movies before, but at no point were you surprised by the placement of the jumpscare itself. That's the feeling that Aldnoah has with its content. When you do nothing but take ideas from other works, it's hard not to see things coming from a mile away. It could still keep your interest because of it, but any sense of validity it may have been desperately holding onto can only be taken seriously from those still new to the experience or less-demanding of their consumer goods. \\n\\n\r\nThis is also true for the main character, Inaho, a default bodysuit made with the sole purpose of giving the viewer a shell to occupy as they walk around the scenery. His expression marked off with a thousand-yard-stare, with an interest in eggs being the only discernable desire shown (no, I'm not even joking). The thin veneer of a \"personality\" is barely there. I've seen dozens of self-insert male protagonists in my lifetime, and yet even I am taken aback by the sheer lack of effort on display here. Being emptied of any personality also seems to be the secret ingredient to becoming a genius tactician as well, as Inaho defeats numerous military personnel using what little school-combat training he acquired before the war broke out. \\n\\n\r\nBut Inaho, lover of eggs and master of combat, isn't alone. Joining him on the main lead podium is his antithesis, Slaine, a person with perhaps too much emotion to spare. Fighting for the Empire of Vers, Slaine is our proxy to see things from the other side. Although, it's more of a surprise that anyone would even grant him a chance to fight any battle instead of placing him in a mental asylum. For every instance of Inaho acting like the human embodiment of a brick wall, Slaine is channeling his inner Joke..., Jared Leto's Joker. It's honestly pretty entertaining, if only for all the wrong reasons. Like if all the autism of the newtype breed in Gundam was balled into a singular entity then condensed into a neutron star. That \"star\" being this highly volatile character, ready to \"go off\" at a moment's notice\u2014and boy, does he ever \"go off.\" \\n\\n\r\nAs if making meta-commentary about the show being a bootleg version of the Gundam franchise, the mecha suits themselves are these jagged clumps of computer-generated apathy. Horrendously processed things that act as constant reminders that you're watching an anime and not truly experiencing it. Thankfully, some of the people staffed with bringing this anime to life seem to have cared about the finished product, as the post-production made attempts to mask issue as much as possible. Fights would often take place at dusk or dawn, with dust and debris kicked up to camouflage the inherent ugliness of the suits in motion. Pilots divebombing as they're surrounded by snow, the cast shadow of a winter storm draped behind them. Busy locations with buildings and landmarks to keep from fixating too much on the CGI combatants. It was all very commendable. Didn't stop the rest of the staff from not giving a fuck, but hey, at least someone tried. Also, Yuki Kajiura did Yuki Kajiura, so there's that. \\n\\n\r\nWhen watching Aldnoah.Zero, it's hard to get upset at it. Sure, you could raise your pitchforks high for what's a blatant ripoff, but really, who cares? It's not going to stop Gundam from existing. There's a 65-foot replica of a Mobile Suit overlooking Tokyo bay after all, while the most adoration Aldnoah is getting is a few action figure purchases off of Amazon's website.\\n\\n\r\nWith lots of violence, cartoonish villainy, and silly narrative twists to go around, Aldnoah.Zero was an entertaining off-brand. The kind of thing you pop in for cheap thrills and occasional blips of entertainment, only to forget it 15 minutes later when you do decide to watch an actual show instead. With all things considered Aldnoah just ended up demonstrating just how much of a seminal piece of work its parent title is, and if only for that bit of indirect self-reinforcement, I accept this dimestore bootleg into the fold.",

            "content": "Spoiler Warning: This review will spoil specific plot points in certain episodes in order to provide examples of why Aldnoah.Zero writing fails for a number of reasons. While I attempted to keep spoilers to a minimum, it\u2019s best recommended to avoid reading this for those who have an interest in checking out Aldnoah.Zero and don\u2019t want anything to be spoiled. In a nutshell, Aldnoah.Zero has the aesthetic for a great series, but no substance to support it not offering anything in between all the eye candy. If you plan to continue reading past this point you have been warned.  \r\n\u201cFiat justitia ruat caelum\u201d isa Latin phrase that means justice must be achieved no matter the consequences. Its usage varies depending on who uses the phrase, especially those among writers in any media, but it has significant value in history prevalent in important court cases where a judge reflects on the duty of the Court. Why do I bring this quote up? This is Aldnoah.Zero tagline that is shown alongside the anime logo in the opening animation. Except it\u2019s translated to \"Let justice be done, though the heavens fall\" in English. Not only is it a misuse of the quote because of A.) Politics don\u2019t exist in Aldnoah.Zero, B.) Heroes aren\u2019t in any danger because of it\u2019s lead character, C.) villains don\u2019t face the consequences despite going against direct orders from their superiors, and finally it\u2019s a one sided conflict that\u2019s black and white with no significant meaning tied to it. Aldnaoh.Zero is a plain and simple a mecha anime about good versus evil. Yet even with that much simplicity no amount of eye candy is able to disguise the poor writing of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nUnredeemable: Nonsensical Story \\n\\n\r\nAldnoah.Zero takes place in the futuristic year of 2014. Basically last year at the time of posting this review. I double checked around the internet and some local newspapers just to make sure this anime wasn\u2019t based around any true events. If they were based on true events than this anime would have played out differently with some level of logic. The anime follows main character Inaho who is thrust into a world of conflict when a peace mission goes disastrously wrong. Everything about it first episode is a mess in writing. It\u2019s bad in establishing the setting, introducing characters, and creating a central conflict that have a sense of weight to it. What exactly it was trying to achieve in its first episode is unfathomable. \\n\\n\r\nWithin this first episode characters provide a quick summarization of a war that occurred in the past in some unnatural exposition. Apparently Vers and Terrans aren\u2019t really all that different since both race when boil down are basically humans. It is also explained that Princess Asseylum is attempting to ease the tension between Vers and the Terrans who I\u2019ll refer to as Earthicans. As soon as something bad happened to Princess Asseylum the Vers Empire immediately launches a military invasion on Earth. A race of species that is more technologically advance than Earthicans apparently doesn\u2019t know how politics function. This one moment becomes further questionable when shown a sick emperor in bed and told he has authority over the Orbital Knights (basically Vers military). The Vers Emperor didn\u2019t issue an attack on Earth to start a war, yet he does nothing to punish those who killed possibly millions. He even goes as far as calling a ceasefire with Earthicans to negotiate peace which goes nowhere near a brain cell in the story. Orbital Knights can do whatever they want without repercussions. In episode 8, Saazbaum, a high ranking Orbital Knight kills another high ranking Orbital Knight and this is never brought up again, nor is the fact he kidnapped a prisoner who was being tortured for information mentioned to him. \\n\\n\r\nFor the central characters, they are never in any danger because of leading character Inaho is the solution for any battle. The other characters don\u2019t get the opportunity to contribute in a battle lessening the group dynamic and eliminating the purpose of teamwork. Inaho plans always work out due to luck or plot conveniences. Usually his plans have smart setup to them. Like in episode 3, Inaho uses a toy plane in order to determine what kind of camera a specific Vers mech is using and how it functions in recording its surrounding. Then the actual plan itself throws away logic in order to write a scenario that best suited to make an action scene around. Opting for escapism over intensity which fails due to how it was set up only to be ruined by good luck in execution.\\n\\n\r\nStill on episode 3, it\u2019s established that a mech uses drones in order for its pilot to see the area around him. In a later episode it shows the Vers empire have developed some sort of teleportation device for communication. So by this anime logic; something difficult like teleportation is achievable for this race, but apparently not allowing it\u2019s own pilot to control its own camera drones from within their own robot is not. No matter how often the anime claims the Vers Empire has the superior technology oversights like these show up regularly which can\u2019t be forgiven. Escapism itself is broken when down the line another plot point will either break that immersion by what it reveals or create more nonsense. The thought of how these Martians who have superior technology, yet act so stupid never leaves the mind.\\n\\n\r\nOne major problem as a whole in the anime is the lack of weight that comes from a worldwide invasion. It never gets across that this war between the Earthicans and Vers Empire is a global issue. Only focusing on a single group never bringing up how other parts of the world are holding up. With a self-contained mindset this central conflict feels less like a major catastrophe by the way it chose to depict it. A small scale approached backfires when the central characters are static when introduced all the way to the end. Supporting characters do change somewhat, but they aren\u2019t the focus feeling free to just leave their storylines dangling in the finale. \\n\\n\r\nEpisode 1 shows a Vers mech using lasers, but other robots Inaho and his group fights against use practical weapon like swords or projectile arms. Despite in several battles Inaho proves with limited training he\u2019s able to overcome any opponent that uses a practical weapons. Vers never change up their tactics, even when it has a success rate of zero percent. Vers strategy comes down to only sending down a single one of their mech pilot to fight against large numbers of Earthicans mech pilots. Not once in this season do the Vers Orbital Knights ever mention perhaps sending two experienced pilots to fight against Inaho since he poses a major obstacle for them. Another issue regarding the weaponry are the soldiers of Vers do have guns, but for unexplained reasons gun type weapons aren\u2019t made for their mechs and if they are not implemented in battles. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime also explains what kind of power source the Vers Empire uses for their technology. Once this plot point gets explained it further questions the villain's motive. Basically, if the only two people who are able to provide power die Vers is as good as dead. Now from the villain's perspective it makes no sense to eliminate the only source of power for your own species. The villain claims he wants to help the masses, but still goes with his plan to kill the royal family, even though they are the key to supplying their planet with energy.\\n\\n\r\nThe final episode of Aldnoah.Zero first season is awful and unfulfilling in every sense. At this point, none of the central cast are developed to care about and the one supporting character who has potential is pushed to the sideline in the finale. Like in previous episodes, there is no sense of suspense on the character's livelihood as they already have victory in their hands by plot convenience and enemy pilot stupidity. Inaho doesn\u2019t struggle much to fight against a pilot whose mech is a combination of mechs that he already fought. With that alone, it guarantees his victory because at this point it proves Vers aren\u2019t intelligent despite the writing claims that they are. How it ends is weak and purely for shock value. Narratively it\u2019s a horrible ending because it forgets to inform the viewer status of Earth, which is at war with Vers. Only offering a narration of what happened to the characters it focused on. Leaving the fate of its central characters ambiguous isn\u2019t bad, but in this case when the characters are one dimensional who really cares what happens to them. \\n\\n\r\nUnredeemable: Shallow, inconsistent characters, and miss opportunities\\n\\n\r\nInaho Kaizuka is a young teenager of average height, short tousled black hair, and our lead character. He\u2019s stoic and despite what his sister claims about him being human in episode 10, Inaho never actually shows human emotion. When he does show emotion it\u2019s out of character; in episode 1 Inaho expresses his interest in buying eggs that are on sale. Within the same episode, a couple minutes later Inaho sees Princess Asseylum of Mars killed in front him, remaining stoic at the sight of it. Showing no concern despite the clear consequences of the assassination he has just witnessed. Later on in the series the anime attempts to ship Inaho with Princess Asseylum which simply does not work because of this one moment. So any affection Inaho shows to his \u201clove interest\u201d is as artificial as the robot he uses. Expecting you to believe he developed emotion for his \u201clove interest\u201d when he showed no reaction when he saw her presumably die in the first episode. \\n\\n\r\nAs a leading character events magically have a way working out for Inaho even though it\u2019s establish in episode one he\u2019s a trainee of the military. Somehow, with minimal training, he surpasses Martian pilots who have had more experience under their belt in actual combat. It\u2019s not because he smart that he wins. It\u2019s either due to plot convenience, his enemy being stupid, or a mixture of both. Another skill Inaho has over his far more experience comrades is the ability to move out of the way of attacks. This godly power can\u2019t be obtain by the other pilots. All of which are usually standing around in front of an enemy attack until they get killed. Granted evasion should be obligatory in basic combat training, but if allowed so Inaho wouldn\u2019t be the overpowered self insert lead that he is. \\n\\n\r\nIn episode ten, Inaho claims that anyone that fights against the same enemy on his side he considers an ally. A statement that is completely proven false in episode seven when he shoots the plane of a Vers pilot that helped him fight for an entire episode. These inconsistencies further weaken the anime when Inaho has no consistent traits let alone a consistent philosophy to believe in. Inaho becomes as much of a plot device as everyone else he interacts with. Finally, Inaho is the character that delivers a speech about how war is used to gain something and ends until the objective is met or the cost outweighs the gain. Not a bad position to take when voicing your thoughts on war, except this character has never shown sympathy when killing his enemy nor ever mentally coped with taking someone's life. He says within the same speech here cares for no such emotion to gain anything in war. So this whole war speech in the final episodes coming from a lead who said he himself \u201cI care for no emotions\u201d is forced to sound deep and makes Inaho full of himself.\\n\\n\r\nAnother major character is Princess Asseylum (who I refer to as Princess Ass since she doesn\u2019t give a shit) is the embodiment of Aldnoah.Zero problems. Easy on the eyes and pleasing, but shallow with no identity of her own. The anime only gives her positive traits like acting like a child when she\u2019s learning about Earth with Inaho and desiring doing the right thing. She looks nice on the surface, but that\u2019s all. In actuality she\u2019s a terrible character. Asseylum has been friends with another major character, Slaine Troyard, for five years showing no concern for him throughout her near death experiences. When reversed, Inaho proved in about a week's time showing no emotion he\u2019s able to capture Princess Asseylum's heart. In context, the anime wanting to ship Inaho and Asseylum makes no sense given how little time they\u2019ve known each other. It\u2019s also brought up in a episode she knew someone was trying to kill her, and doesn\u2019t bother to take extra security just to be cautious in case anything happens. Then again, the Earthicans don\u2019t bother giving her protection when they attempt to keep her safe so I shouldn\u2019t be surprised.\\n\\n\r\nSlaine Troyard (not the only pointless reference to Greek mythology) is another poorly written character. His conflict of wanting to be accepted by the Vers Empire is worth investing on paper. Having to overcome the racist mindset of his superior officers and being treated like scum. In execution it\u2019s the opposite, creating scenarios forced to make the viewer care for him. There\u2019s an entire episode dedicated to Slaine being tortured, which doesn\u2019t since in the same episode, it shows Princess Asseylum without care enjoying the day. This episode's impact is lessened when the entire Vers race is one dimensional and not given any redeeming values to perceive them as actual people. \\n\\n\r\nSupporting characters, just like the main three, that receive tons of screen time are merely plot devices. There was potential with the character Marito to create a satisfying subplot. His back story is compelling, has likable traits by being himself, and has a strong personal turmoil that he can\u2019t immediately overcome. Seeing Marito struggle and trying his best to improve himself provides the best moments in the anime. Unfortunately, by the finale his subplot is left unresolved. \\n\\n\r\nAnother wasted opportunity is with character Yuki Kaizuka (Inaho\u2019s sister). Like Marito, Yuki carries a permanent scar from war with her. Unlike Marito conflict, Yuki war scar is resolved quickly and has no important use afterwards. The thought of her brother being an expressionless killing machine never bothers her either. When one of Inaho friends asks Yuki why Inaho is expressionless. She answers by saying yes, he does. A wasted opportunity to develop Inaho beyond a stoic lead, and a miss opportunity to explore what kind of life, Yuki had with Inaho since the status of their parents' livelihood is never brought up. Other minor supporting characters serve a single purpose. There\u2019s one created to simply die, there\u2019s one that created to be simply racist against Earthicans, there\u2019s one simply created to be sick so the Vers can have power, and so on.\\n\\n\r\nRayet Areash the worst of the supporting cast being given a position in the anime similar to that of Gavrilo Princip. The anime attempts to paint her in a sympathetic light, except for the fact that it was her fault as well that millions of people got killed. Forgetting this fact, it dedicates an entire scene in episode 10 where she blames Princess Asseylum for something out of her control. Somehow she\u2019s able to make Princess Asseylum feel guilty. This is the equivalent of making Archduke Franz Ferdinand the villain and making him apologize for being assassinated. It doesn\u2019t work that way, even in fictional context when the entire starting point for the story's existence is because she helped in the assassination. For unexplained reasons, she\u2019s also allowed to do whatever she wants on a military base.\\n\\n\r\nThen there\u2019s the villain Saazbaum who is about as well thought out as the writing in the anime. This character personifies how nonsensical the writing is in physical form. For starter, his motive contradicts his goal. He hates the royal family for manipulating the masses, but the first episode the emperor sends his daughter to Earth for a peace mission. He also initiates an attack on Earth without consulting the emperor. Despite his intentions to help the masses, he fully should grasp the consequences of his own action by attempting to eliminate the only source of power for the Vers Empire. These two points don\u2019t add up; just like the Vers technology and their actual intelligence. The writing never treats the characters it creates as actual characters. They\u2019re a means as story devices and nothing more.\\n\\n\r\nGood: Production side of the anime is generally good\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is a joint effort between A-1 Pictures and Troyca. Together they create an anime that all around looks great. It clearly has a high budget incorporating both 2D animation with nice looking 3D robot models that aren\u2019t distracting. Environments in general tend to come across as being large and empty. Since our heroes are on the move battles, mostly take place in environments where nothing much is happening in the background. In some cases, it is put into good use to keep an action scene moving in an large environment as well as showing some environmental destruction. In one action scene, the size of an environment is use to its advantage when Inaho has to stop an attack from a Vers mech on an ship he\u2019s on. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, the biggest drawback is there\u2019s no visual scale growth in the battles. One of the few memorable scenes in Aldnoah.Zero is in the first episode where an explosion has a similar impact to that of an atomic bomb hitting Earth. Buildings crumbles, cars are blown away by a gust of wind, onlooker to the site are in shock, and it\u2019s large scale destruction implants what a serious threat the Vers Empire is. Everything else, past this moment feels smaller in comparison. There isn\u2019t another scene that visually comes close to matching the mass destruction in episode one. All the characters have appealing looking design no matter the situation. Especially Slaine, who even when being tortured looks good! Particle effects are in no short supply to adding more visual flair to the battles. \\n\\n\r\nOne questionable decision in the animation would be the mechs even when stationary are still in 3D. It makes sense in a action scene to use 3D since the thirdimension offer more maneuverability than a 2D plane, but it comes across lazy when mechs are stationed and simply there to show off its high budget. The downside to the animation is the awful staging of the action scenes. Going more for visuals splendor than actual staging. So in most battles there will be multiple mech stationed in one position accepting their death or shooting to hold off an enemy attack. Without a single creative battle that avoid doing these things action scenes are a one time deal for entertainment. \\n\\n\r\nVoice acting is serviceable. The writing didn\u2019t offer much in anything so the voice cast are stuck with what they are given. Natsuki Hanae plays protagonist Inaho and he\u2019s stoic throughout the series. His vocals, mostly stay in emotionless delivery range sounding uninterested in anything. It\u2019s not a compelling performance because there\u2019s no range, but he does portray how the character was written properly. Then there\u2019s Kensho Ono, who plays Slaine, who has a slightly more open role. He gets to scream in pain when his character is tortured, sound serious, concerned, and in the finale near hysterical when he goes insane. Ono role is similar to Hanae where in both performance they have to repeat themselves. Sora Amamiya plays princess Asseylum. It\u2019s passable in general. When Amamiya portrays the more innocent and childlike side of Asseylum she\u2019s convincing as Asseylum, but when in a dramatically heavy scene she falls short. She\u2019s sounds like she\u2019s on autopilot delivering most of her dramatic material with little variation no matter the context of a scene. \\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast in general suffer from the same handicap that Natsuki Hanae is given in which they mostly portrayed a single character trait. This is especially true for voice actors that get casted as Vers Martians. Show Hayami who plays Cruhte only yells for his time on screen. Only having one tone voice in the series. Inori Minase plays Edderlrittuo and sounds like a little girl. It\u2019s an appropriate performance getting across Eddelrittuo sisterly love towards Princess Asseylum. \\n\\n\r\nTooru Ookawa plays Saazbaum and unlike Hayami who\u2019s allowed a single scene to change up his act Ookawa isn\u2019t as fortunate. His performance isn\u2019t bad, but it\u2019s a single note role where one line delivery is no different from line another delivery. Takahiro Sakurai plays Trillram and thanks to his more expressive character taking delight in killing people. He\u2019s the most enjoyable screen presence out of all the pilots that Inaho fight against. Yuki Kaida plays Femieanne, Hiroki Yasumoto plays Vlad, and Mamiko Noto, who plays Orlane aren\u2019t as lucky in playing interesting villains. They lack the proper screen time to make something out of their role being forgettable once off screen. Sachika Misawa plays Rayet Areash. While the character is full of herself Misawa performance is fine since she does her best to make her character sympathetic despite what she did. There is a scene in episode 10 where she\u2019s allowed to express her dislike for the Vers empire and it\u2019s a highlight for her performance.\\n\\n\r\nAny Japanese voice actor playing an Earthican gets sideline eventually into the background. Unlike the voice actors that play a Vers. Earthicans voice actors don\u2019t have a single episode where they\u2019re given a highlight moment to show off their acting chops. They get stuck in a single note sometime delivering the same lines of dialogue word for word in different episodes. Ai Kayano who plays Darzana Magbaredge and Yuu Shimamura who plays Kaoru Mizusaki have this problem. Whenever they share a scene together, it plays out the same getting repetitive over time. \\n\\n\r\nThe best voice actor in the cast regardless of what race he portrays is Kazuya Nakai and that\u2019s because he plays Kouichirou Marito. His character suffers mental turmoil while on the outside, he shows a free caring personality. Nakai is allowed the freedom to vocalize different sides of a single character more so than anyone in the cast. When he mentally breaks down it\u2019s believable through his delivery. His performance is the most interesting because he\u2019s funny, likable, and a compelling actor in the role. It\u2019s a shame that his character isn\u2019t fully use to his full potential in order to create a good character.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is composed by Hiroyuki Sawano mixing ambient and techno music with aggressive synthesizers, beats, even some 8-bit and a few thunderous orchestral compositions thrown in with Japanese singers singing German lyrics. The music is all around a great fit for the anime and when used correctly in its placement creates some stellar scenes. In episode 1, the musical piece \u201caLIEz\u201d sung by mizuki is played during a scene of mass destruction is instantly memorable. It\u2019s not as demoralizing seeing an atomic bomb like explosion at the sight of a more technically advance race, wiping out humans with ease, but it\u2019s a cool scene none the less. As great as the music might be there tracks that get reused frequently. In particular the track \u201cBRE@THLESS\u201d sung by mizuki is used in a number of action scenes. Preferably when there\u2019s a chase scene this track will likely play. Losing what made them exciting musical pieces in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime has a single theme song that\u2019s also used as the ending theme in episode 1 is titled \u201cHeavenly Blue\u201d by Kalafina. Despite the less than stellar opening animation \u201cHeavenly Blue\u201d manages to create a strong atmosphere with orchestral composition along with a catchy chorus. It does feel slightly phoned in since there\u2019s not an extra push or power to the track that really demands your attention. The following tracks are sung by mizuki are \u201caLIEz\u201d used as an ending theme in episode 4, 7-8, 10-11 and \u201cA/Z\u201d in 2-3, 5-6, 9. \u201caLIEz\u201d loses some of its impact since it\u2019s used frequently in the series failing to rekindle the same feeling when hearing it for the first time. While the usage in the anime distracts from its impact over time the track is a great listen. \u201cA/Z\u201d is more of a techno side with 8-bit beats that\u2019s more optimistic in general. In both tracks mizuki vocals add to the songs; in \u201caLIEz\u201d her vocals are on a level of opera singing those high notes beautifully sounding as epic as the interustmentals. In \u201cA/Z\u201d she sounds almost robotic like which is fitting for the track. Sawano score is fantastic, but how it\u2019s used in the anime tends to undermine it. \\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: It killed some brain cells\\n\\n\r\nUsually the first time I ever see an anime I don\u2019t go in them with a critical mindset. Although, fleshed out characters and a story that have working elements is part of the requirement for an anime to be enjoyable for me. However, the first episode did so many things poorly that I couldn\u2019t simply see it without critical thinking. What flipped the switch in my brain was the scene where Inaho showed more emotion for a sale for eggs more so than he does the princess of another planet trying to bring peace to both race when killed in front of him. From then on it\u2019s been nothing, but an infuriating experience how little of the anime was fully thought out. I was so infuriated by Aldnoah.Zero I didn\u2019t bother waiting for any news regarding an English dub. I went into writing out a review for it. Not even the action scenes for as pretty as they look were awfully staged and required very little to no strategy on the characters part. Aside from hearing Hiroyuki Sawano score there wasn\u2019t any other good reason the anime provided to keep me watching. If it ain\u2019t evident with a review consisting of over 4000 words that I think very poorly of Aldnoah.Zero first season I don\u2019t know what will convince you.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 0/3\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 0/3\\n\\n\r\nTechnical: 3/3\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: 0/1\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nAldnoah.Zero is nothing more than eye candy and takes pride in that. It\u2019ll excuse logic and good characters if it means it\u2019ll get to show off nice looking action scenes. Understanding what type audience, it wants to appeal to, but mere action spectacles aren\u2019t enough to make an anime worth viewing. It takes itself too seriously unable to be dumb fun, it\u2019s too idiotic to touch on the topic of war maturely, and paints each side in black and white dumbing down the premise to be approachable sacrificing depths along with it. Its central lead wins through a series of plot convenience and luck that remove the suspense of battles. It\u2019s all aesthetics and without substance, it guarantee its own expiration date in a short amount of time. Once you\u2019ve seen the explosions and action there\u2019s nothing left to Aldnoah.Zero.",

            "content": "Aldnoah.Zero not only flashed the name Urobuchi before it aired, but it was supposedly seen as the love child between Legend of the galactic heroes and gundam wing. I'm glad they used a condom because Aldnoah.Zero would tarnish their names through association.\r\nAldnoah.Zero follows the strained relationship between humans (commonly referred to as Terrans) and Martians (from mars). After an assassination attempt on the princess of mars, war breaks out with the Martians, whom wielding their sacred Aldnoah technology fight against the earthlings. The show depicts the war from both sides.\r\nAldnoah.Zero follows the mecha genre in more of a 'super robot' format than the 'real robot'format due to the mysticism of Aldnoah technology. As for the themes of the show, it attempts to highlight how the hate and obsession of what others have, as well as prejudice, can lead to the loss of many human and martian lives. The show also dabbles into the characters feelings of what the war personally means to them, as well as if there will be anything gained from it. As for the fighting, it's based more on tactics than on brute strength, as the Martians  overwhelming technology would mean outright victory if it wasn't fought on tactics. As for the pacing, the shows first three episodes are paced well with very good plot development and suspense in each episode, after that the shows pace shows down, usually ending on a cliffhanger each episode.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the show is ruined by the large amounts of 'anime logic', in which events favor the main characters too much rather than being slightly more realistic. For example, although the Martians have almost invincible mecha robots due to their power, the glaring and awful design of them leads to them being defeated with only the slightest bit of common sense. As this happens each week, none of the fights contain any suspense due to the high amounts of predictability. Furthermore, after episode 3 (low and behold, the end of Urobuchi's involvement in the show entirely), the episodes lose their valor, pondering on pointless dialog, with slight hints of character development and slow plot development.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the animation, a large budget would have been needed for this show, as the fights with the mecha are done to a very high standard. Although the transitions and  movement of the mecha are not super smooth, it didn't have a negative effect on fighting scenes.\\n\\n\r\nLeading onto the cast, this is where the show really disappoints. The main protagonists are Inaho (terran), Slaine (a terran who works for the Martians), Princess Asseylum vers Allusia of mars and Rayet (a martian). As for character  development, it's night and day between the protagonists. Slaine it's the most developed in the show, he is constantly striving and struggling to do what's right for the princess and although he may get things wrong, he fights his hardest to work to the goal of saving the princess. It's very similar to Rayet, whom acts more towards the end of the show as someone who moves the plot along, this comes from the peril she has come across during the war affecting her greatly, which leads her to take action.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, the princess and Inaho face little or no development. The princess is too pampered for most of the series, and only starts truly knowing the extent in which the war has had on everyone's life. But it's Inaho which divides most opinion. Inaho has received virtually no character development at all. For a character that shows no emotion when his friend dies in front of him, it's difficult to look at him as being a relatable character, and therefore is difficult to like. His lack of emotions may make him look cool under pressure, but in the end he comes truly across as cold. Not to mention his brilliant tactics, as he is the only person who can defeat the Martians, he becomes so overpowered he virtually takes control of the army ship whilst others stand by and watch, which ends up being very boring.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the opening song, it starts off slightly classical before turning into a slight heavy jpop song, which I didn't really sit well with. The original OST was very good, making each battle distinct and entertaining. The show contained no ending song.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, Aldnoah.Zero is a prime example of how name dropping and high expectation can ruin a series, and it did in this case. Although it was the most talked about anime this season, I wouldn't recommend it due to the poor writing of the show.",

            "content": "\"Let Justice be done, though the trainwreck rolls.\"\r\nAldnoah.Zero is an original sci-fi mecha anime about an intergalactic war between Terrans and Martians. It was highly anticipated because of the superstar names under the ones who made the show, A-1 Pictures, Gen Urobuchi as the original story creator and script writer and Hiroyuki Sawano making the soundtrack. However, the creators and hype don't guarantee a good anime, and we witnessed that in full bloom here.\r\nPlot:\r\nAfter a Martian princess Asseylum Vers Allusia comes to Earth in attempt to form a friendly bond between Terrans (Earth habitants) and Martians (Mars habitants), she is assasinated during a parade. OutragedMartians launch a massive attack from Mars to Earth in attempt to annihilate all Terrans. The story follows a group of students with a military unit as they try to survive the war against the superior Martian mechas, Aldnoahs.\\n\\n\r\nThe war plot is fine for the most part, but there supposedly was another war 15 years before the events of the show which ended with massive consequences. The Earth is already in an apocalyptic setting, but there's no exploration of it at all. The anime starts destroying the setting in the very first episode without any establishment at all. The results? You don't care about what's going on!\\n\\n\r\nThe story is extremely predictable. It was sure as hell that the princess survived, and that Martians themselves participated in the assasination. The show attempts to have tension, in the early episodes following a \"villain of the week\" format. The problem is in the extreme differences in mecha power, with Aldnoahs basically wiping the floor, so it takes a lot of plot armor for our protagonists to overcome the enemies. So much that you barely care what's going on, because no matter what the odds are, our heroes always win.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nI've mentioned \"you don't care what's going on\" a few times in this review already. Well, this is the section where everything starts going downhill, with the characters. Billions of people die, but our heroes don't care at all. They witness a genocide right infront of their eyes, but the level of apathy shown was so high I didn't think it was even possible. The worst care scenario is Inaho Kaizuka, the main protagonist. I really thought his lack of emotions or personality was a plot point and there would be an explanation as to why he doesn't give a shit when his friends die infront of his face, but there wasn't. He is a silent super smart guy that wins battles using anime's insanely stupid logic and flawed physics, and forms a sub-harem with chicks he travels with, because girls must be interested in the main character at all times for no reasons given.\\n\\n\r\nMoving forward, we have Inko, Calm and Nina, completing the student group, once again having surprising level of lack of emotion, but not so much as Inaho. Yuki Kaizuka is the overprotective nee-san of Inaho, who also acts as a bridge of connections for the group to get into the military unit. Rayet is another girl that joins the fleet later on, and she was part of the group that was told to assasinate the princess, but her father is slaughtered infront of her eyes and all she does is blink. Lieutenant Marito was the most laughable attempt of character development through PTSD I've seen in this show and anime in general for a long time, the potential he had from episode 1 was huge but he ends up being completely irrelevant. Ending the 0 to 1 dimensional characters is Magbaredge, the unit's leader.\\n\\n\r\nThings are more interesting in the Martian side, where we have a deuteragonist Slaine acting as the protagonist there. He formed a bond with the princess being her teacher about Earth, but even he is a one dimensional character whose sole purpose seems to be saving the princess, and having a one to two personality traits. Saazbaum is a plot device, has some sort of reason behind his actions but they're not explored. Princess Asseylum was the best character of the show, as she is the only one who gives a shit about people dying everywhere and has some sort of personality. The villains of the week of the Martian sides are just 0 dimensional dolls that have insanely high amount of pride and disgust for weaklings and they all lose because of that.  So much potential wasted!\\n\\n\r\nThe problem with the characters is that you just don't care about them. Most of them are just emotionless puppets or plot devices that are there to just be there or just to move the story forward. Marito, Saazbaum and Asseylum were the only ones who had some sort of internal conflicts and were the only ones who were affected by this tragedy and that had influence on their actions (and not that they had lots of time to get decent amount of exploration considering everything that was going on), but the rest of the cast? Genocide is an everyday thing, guys! It doesn't even help the characters that they get Urobutchered in the end, it was just a sad attempt to create drama and tragedy.\\n\\n\r\nWriting:\\n\\n\r\nAnd here we get to the most awful part of the show. The writing is just ludicrous. There are millions of instances of plot inconsistencies and defying logic of physics and common sense, so much that you cannot take it seriously. Plot holes were just glaring throughout the entire anime, and even if the anime does get a second season in attempt to gloss them over, they just destroy any sort of fluid continuity or attempts to care about the situation when they just flip it over 360 degrees with introducing a new plot device or solving the issue with deus-ex-machina. The characters don't help either, there is no global perspective of humanity and what do they do in this situation, or how was their life inbetween the wars. Everything that we know comes from the characters that the story follows, and they are just awfully apathic, effectively making everything useless. If the characters don't care, neither does the audience care.\\n\\n\r\nAll of the battles between the Terran fleet and the Aldnoahs consist of the Martian Knights being overconfident, playing a \"cat and mouse\" game and getting Jerry'ed. One moment they destroy entire cities just upon landing, and in another moment they get shot from a pistol and explode. It is extremely hard to take fights seriously with such huge power disparity between sides, with the weaker side winning all the time because of defying logic of physics or just because of plot convieniences. Not to mention, the Aldnoah concepts of power are extremely stupid with such advanced technology of theirs that they just can't crush a piece of metal can that is a normal mecha the Terrans use. The audience is led to believe that the Aldnoahs are supremely powerful, but that never happens in the fights for some reason. At this point, I just wanted the writing crew to try and save the fights by introducing a super-powerful mecha equal to Aldnoahs to give to the main protagonist and try to have cliched, but atleast logically reasonable battles.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the anime does stay away from unneccesary fanservice and doesn't try to have comedy out of place. They do have a pseudo-comic relief character in Calm, but the themes are not butchered because of it: it is trying to be a mature story without any distractions, and they do a good job at telling a story without the need to throw boobs at you every 5 seconds to keep you interested.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and sound:\\n\\n\r\nI have to give credit where credit is due, though. Animation looks really solid in this one. The character designs are okay, the mecha designs are okay. Even the CGI looks fluid, to be honest. However, sometimes (and especially the last episode) the action is just so quick you barely know what the hell is going on, what was damaged and what was not. It should have toned down the tempo during fights so you can clearly see what happened or what is about to happen, because considering the power inequality between sides you may reach to wrong conclusions after an attack happens.\\n\\n\r\nHiroyuki Sawano is often found guilty for overusing the same tracks over and over again in the soundtrack. He did it with Shingeki, he did it with Kill La Kill, and Aldnoah is no exception. However, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. The grandiose scale style of Sawano's music fits perfectly with the action, and it was one of the main reasons I still followed this show after so many shortcomings. And yes, he uses a lot of German lyrics in this one too.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening sequence is pretty basic, it has nice visuals but a really generic and lackluster music to go with, it gives a big Fate/Zero vibe. The ED to the show, \"aLIEz\", is Sawano's one of the best tracks created, and it especially fit in the demolition part of episode 1. The other ED, A/Z, is pretty basic and unmemorable.\\n\\n\r\nSummary:\\n\\n\r\nAldnoah.Zero is a rather failed attempt at creating an exciting mecha battle show with tragedy, as it is lackluster in both of the categories. It ends in Urobutcher's style, on a cliffhanger, and barely resolves anything. As with all Urobutcher shows, a proper characterization of the cast is non-existant. The second season is scheduled to air in January 2015, so atleast that has going for it, which is nice, but in all honesty, after this first season there shouldn't be lots of expectations going forward. It is just an another anime with overblown hype, with medium thinking that famous names grant a well made work. They don't. And I only enjoyed the soundtrack, and which is the only good thing this anime can provide.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: 4.2/10\\n\\n",

            "content": "When I first heard that Man of Steel was referenced in an interview pertaining to Aldnoah.Zero, with Gen Urobuchi also playing a small part in the project, I had a general idea of what to expect from the series. I wasn't wrong. The high production values, high amounts of collateral damage, questionably bland characters, and a controversial ending are a close match to the recent DC Comic film about Superman. Mix in some grim thematics that Urobuchi is notorious for and we now have our new mecha tragedy series. \r\nWhile the overall premise of Aldnoah.Zero is heavily based off of the tension and prejudice betweenthe people of Earth and the Martians of Vers is easy to follow, there are many parts of the writing that qualitatively vary from good to bad. There are aspects that I enjoyed, such as Inaho actually using some tactics to outwit his opponents and smooth plot progression, but there were also very noticeable flaws. One of the biggest gripes I had with this series \u2014 though it may seem like nitpicking to some \u2014 was its historic timeline. In 1972, the Apollo 17 mission finds a hypergate to Mars on the surface of the moon. The astronauts discover Aldnoah, which grants them immense knowledge, technical prowess, and ability to colonize Mars. Soon after, many humans from Earth migrate to Mars and form the Empire of Vers. In the span of a couple decades the Vers Empire obtains and acts on their newfound feeling of superiority over Earth. The Vers Empire ignites a war and instigates heavy collateral damage to both themselves and Earth. It's as if Aldnoah gave the people of Vers technical savvy at the cost of brain damage. Considering that the martians came from Earth not too long ago themselves, and the first generation of immigrants are mostly still alive, their heavy prejudice comes off as confusing and highly implausible.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Aldnoah.Zero are extremely hit or miss. Inaho, a Japanese high school student, is one of the main characters of the series. Unfortunately, he also has the personality of a stone. For a majority of the series he's portrayed as intelligent, emotionless, calm, and collected. Allied forces, friends, and civilians getting killed right in front of his eyes? No problem, poker face. About to get killed during a battle with a superior Martian mech? No problem, poker face. He\u2019s the stoic, but well-collected type of character, which people will either enjoy or despise. Despite being an offender of using this character archetype, it's hard to point the finger at Aldnoah.Zero specifically. Nearly all mecha anime are like this; you can never win. In any given mecha series you will either get a genius-level pilot that gets things done at the expense of personality or a useless, beta MC that relies solely on asspulls, a significantly stronger mech, and the power of friendship. Personally, I prefer the former. \\n\\n\r\nAs much as I'd like to discuss Slaine and Asseylum, since they are the other two major point of view characters, it would be difficult to do so without spoilers. In a broad sense, they're not bad characters. Asseylum is a bit generic, taking on the typical pure, benevolent princess role, while Slaine is basically the pinnacle of suffering and angst. At the very least, I can say that Slaine was interesting to watch.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the rest of the cast aren't terrible, they also aren\u2019t exactly a well-written bunch. Because there isn\u2019t a lot of screen time allotted to them, most of the supporting cast are easily forgettable or just completely insignificant. The main antagonists of the series, the Orbital Knights of Vers, are originally perceived as extremely dangerous due to the power of Aldnoah and their vastly superior Cataphracts decimating the Earth armed forces opposition. Unfortunately, their glaring character faults begin to show upon entering combat with Inaho; they quickly turn into nothing more than a villain of the week plot device. Marito, who gets noticeably more screen time than other side characters, is haunted by his past and PTSD. Originally I thought the whole PTSD idea was interesting. You don\u2019t see too many series touch upon the subject and relate its severity well. The problem with Marito and his PTSD is that it\u2019s constantly shoved in your face on several occasions for little to no reason. It\u2019d be one thing if Marito grew as a character and showed any signs of recovery, or usefulness for that matter, but there isn\u2019t. His scenes in the second half of the series acted as nothing more than empty screen-time devoted to reminding the audience that Marito has been traumatized. That time spent focusing on Marito could have been much better utilized in fleshing out other characters who desperately needed depth. It\u2019s disappointing that it wasn\u2019t.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest attribute that Aldnoah.Zero has going for it is the aforementioned production values. The series looks and sounds fantastic. I'm not a fan of CG, but even that is visually implemented very well. The OST of the series was surprisingly quite small, in comparison to nearly any other show. Most of the background music, despite sounding sublime, is reused often. The concept of having less tracks, but making them of higher quality is something I might like to see more often. It worked well in this case.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the first season of Aldnoah.Zero was a fairly good watch overall, it seemed more like a setup for what\u2019s to come in its second cour. We\u2019ve been introduced to several characters and plot struggles, but nothing too substantial came about until the ending of the first season. It\u2019s unclear what direction the series will go in, but I suppose we\u2019ll just have to wait and see.",

Character development is sadly not very existent, and the story is mostly predictable with a few twists (except the end...)\r\nStory: 7. Rather predicable with a few twists. Coherent for the most part. Was best in first few episodes and the last 2. In between I kinda felt like watch someone play a RPG. You know, defeat a bad guy, oh look, there's a new one. The ending was unexpected... but feels really random. I really wonder what season 2 will be like.\r\nArt andSound: 9. CG was used but it fit well, flowed smoothly. The music was great. The OP and ED are both decent. Eye candy. This made the battles a joy to watch (if you didn't pay much attention to the script/writing).\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5. Decent characters but not developed. Some side characters had interesting backstories but they were never used. Just kinda in the background, like \"Hey, I'm still here\". Villains were all the same except the main, who probably had the most depth out of all the characters... Ok fine, like 2 other \"good\" characters are developed ok... but development is kinda absent for everyone. I hope season 2 fixes (improves on) this. The characters have been introduced already, can they develop now?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8. Self-explanatory. Read above.",

            "content": "War is a controversial word. People fight in wars for a variety reasons. Oppression, liberation, or imperialism are just a few reasons. But fighting a war for survival sometimes also become a reason without choice. In Aldnoah Zero, that war takes place in 2015. After fifteen years of peace, we have one side from Mars (the Vers Empire) trying to annihilate Earth off their existence in its galaxy. To say the least, Aldnoah Zero hits where it hurts. It establishes the foundation of sci-fi action series with war but also other factors packaged into this Summer extravaganza. \r\nFor starters, Aldnoah Zero already had several keypoints that made the show one of the most anticipated series prior to its release. The key staff involves Gen Urobutchi, who served as the script writer of the first three episodes. The combination A-1 Pictures\u2019 production qualities with Hiryouki Sawano\u2019s music score also creates the tension of what may be expected. Nonetheless, the series is done without any source material. It\u2019s a standalone show divided into two halves as this review will cover the first split cour.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s much to learn about the origins of the series. If we go back into history, the show actually established its origins over 40 years ago. In 1972, an alien artifact known as the Hypergate was discovered that made colonizing on Mars possible. From there on, the powerful yet mysterious technology known as the \u201cAldnoah\u201d was discovered that allowed settlers (later known as Martians) to survive there. The catch is that these Martians declared war on United Earth after establishing independence. An event known as the \u201cHeaven\u2019s Fall\u201d occurred that shattered Mars breaking the war stalemate. Now present in 2014, we have this princess named Asseylum Vers Allusia from the Vers Empire coming to Earth for a visit. Unfortunately, an assassination attempt ensures and all hell breaks loose. If all this sounds a bit generic, then you\u2019ll probably right. Without a doubt, Aldnoah Zero dances around with the concept of a war between two fronts \u2013 the Martians (Vers Empire) and the United Earth (Earthlings). Not to be confuse with invasion, both sides seeks to maintain superiority over the other.  However, there\u2019s also a catch in that Asseylum tries to create a state of peace like it has maintained 15 years ago. But who are we kidding here? The first episode breaks the boundary of any sense of peace when a terrorist attack occurs in full view of the public. Not only that but New Orleans goes out with a big bang. Peace? Hope? Prosperity? What Heaven\u2019s Fall established is what the tagline suggests:\\n\\n\r\n\u201cLet Justice be done, though the heavens fall\u201d\\n\\n\r\nAs a sci-fi action series, it\u2019s easy to say that the show is consistently engaging and challenging itself. The first episode creates the tension between the Martians and Earthlings already with an attempted terrorist attack. In full of the public, we witness the princess \u201cdie\u201d as an assassination attempt. On the other hand, we also meet the earthlings. However, it\u2019s hard to believe in the hype when we realize that the main characters are no more than mere high school students. The guy that may or may not stand out is Inaho Kaizuka. With a strange interest in eggs, the young boy is a difficult character to read. His calmness (as demonstrated during the terrorist attack) and intuitions makes one of the most mysterious character of the series. Throughout the course of the show, he also demonstrates tactics with excellent calculations and strategic maneuvers. His risky moves often puts others at risk but his stoic face often shows that he has confidence in an almost predetermined-like outcome. That\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg though. Joining Inaho are his friends, allies, and even his sister who also plays a crucial role in the military. But perhaps the most prominent ally of Inaho is none other than the Vers Empire princess herself. \\n\\n\r\nThe Vers Empire family is an interesting generation of characters to say the least. Unlike most of the Martians, Asselyum is sympathetic towards Earth and its people. She wishes to create a state of peace and even has fascination of Earth\u2019s inhabitants and creations. Her kind nature sharply contrasts with most of the Martians as they wish to invade Earth and destroy it. However, there\u2019s a noticeable flaw that viewers may see from her: self-insecurity. Throughout the show, she constantly tells herself that the ongoing war is perhaps her own fault. This is considered faulty logic considering the fact that the Martians are looking for an excuse for a war. (the attempted assassination) In fact, the behaviors of some of the Martians could even be described as borderline psychotic such as the case of Trillram during his crazed rampage on Earth. Others such as Vlad are more careful with their goals. However, their motivations remain the same and that\u2019s to destroy Earth. Yet, there are some people from the Empire who seeks other reasons to come to Earth. A prominent example would be Slaine Troyard, an Earth born human (Terran). Flashbacks reveal his encounter with the princess during his childhood and since then, the two have become very close friends. Unfortunately, Slaine isn\u2019t exactly a character that receives credible characterization. His one motivation seems to be his interest to reunite with the princess. Throughout the war, he reluctantly fights the Terrans, kills a fellow comrade, and even undergoes intense torture after an attempted escape from a Mars capital ship. His temporary alliance with the Martians also becomes his fault as he quickly learns the consequences. In retrospect, Slaine\u2019s loyalty could be his downfall as his actions creates tensions between him and the Martians.\\n\\n\r\nThis series doesn\u2019t quite have a taste of originality to its premise or delivery. The prejudice of the Martians against Terrans isn\u2019t something new in sci-fi series. In this show, it borderlines on the line of genocide and imperialism as the Martians wishes to establish supremacy in the universe. A quick look back will make us realize how desperate some of them are with their tactics such as falsely trying make their Emperor believe that the princess was assassinated. Still, most of their characters have a one dimensional view of Earth. Only a few of the Martians get characterization throughout the show and surprisingly enough, Cruhteo (Slaine\u2019s superior officer) is one of them after he discovers the truth. Similarly, Saazbaum is also both an interesting character and antagonist. His role in the war eclipses most of the single minded motivations of the other invaders as he wishes to gain revenge for results of the Heaven\u2019s Fall. \\n\\n\r\nRevenge actually has more of a meaning though. One particular character wishes to regain revenge against the Martians after her own father is killed in the ongoing war. Her motivations become increasingly dangerous with PTSD-like tendencies as she tries to assassinate Assleyum herself. These self-motivations builds on the psychological impact of how war can be. The truth is that war is fought for reasons but there are no righteousness with the laws. Heaven\u2019s Fall is just one event that gained the vengeance of certain characters. \\n\\n\r\nOn the Terran side, there\u2019s a plague of clich\u00e9s when it comes to the character cast. We have the childhood friend Nina (with a presumed crush on the protagonist, Inaho), the lone wolf Rayet, the energetic Calm, Inaho\u2019s older sister Yuki with a tough boss type attitude. The character cast on the Earth side lacks characterization or depth on most parts. Inaho stands out as the most prominent character not just for his roles but as a soldier and tatician. The strategies he utilizes often are risky but the results are often surprising as the Martians realizes his skills. And speaking of risks, Aldnoah Zero plays a bit around with drama. Unfortunately, it feels brain-dead with the way it\u2019s executed and almost silly at times. To say the least, it also creates a sense of manipulative tearjerker with the ongoing war struggles. Comical moments has weird timing as well and some jokes are generic with repetition. There are also a lot of ironic moments in the show and cruelly timed moments that may seem unpredictable but feels generic once the dust settles down. At the same time, the show has a fast pacing especially with the other main protagonist, Slaine. He becomes a major scapegoat for his troubles as he fails to stop the war, betrayed by a temporary ally, and tortured by his own superior officer.  It\u2019s really hard to see him as a role model with what he has done despite his seemingly good intentions that ends up being left stranded. Other issues of the series include asspull moments although some of it is minimized by strategic scenarios with Inaho being the main cause.\\n\\n\r\nOn the technical front, the visuals establishes the fact of a futuristic/alternate setting. The sci-fi themes are most definitely featured with exquisite features such as the mecha used. The lost technology used by the Martians have distinctive mecha designs such as Trollheim\u2019s defensive Kataphract Nilokeras, the six-armed Kataphract Hellas, and Vlad\u2019s modified machine armed with proton swords. In retrospect, they are impressive and shows the difference in firepower between the Martians and the Terrans. The way CG is adapted also hardly distracting. However, character designs of the Terrans are generic. In fact, most of the main characters look nothing like members of the military. Neither Inaho nor Slaine has any distinctive characteristics at all. However, Asseylum stands out as the princess with her pure beauty and elegance. On the other hand, her personal maid/assistant looks like a child that makes us wonder if the show takes itself seriously at times. Still, overall action coordination is magnificent with the choreography and well-timed battle scenes. Fan service is also minimal except during one shower scene. Take it for granted as this show is a cinematic blockbuster with the artistic delivery.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack plays more of a role than just being part of the series. The brainchild of the soundtrack, Sawano, brings together an intense set of beat with its techno style OST. It seizes moments to capture every battle at the core while climaxes are delivered with memorable moments. (see New Orleans) Kalafina\u2019s involvement with the theme songs is also easily recognizable as well. Striking the right and balanced cords, the show\u2019s soundtrack becomes a prominent centerpiece that\u2019s even more as a supplement. Voice mannerisms also makes its point well with Inaho\u2019s stoic expressive dialogues, Assleyum\u2019s calm way of speaking, and the Martian\u2019s aggressiveness. You want wartime drama? You\u2019ll get wartime drama. The soundtrack makes it that damn more acceptable.\\n\\n\r\nAs a sci-fi science show with war themes and mecha, it\u2019s easy to say the show might not be for everyone. The story has problems with its writing when it comes to some characters. There\u2019s also no escape of clich\u00e9s with the characters themselves on both the Martian and Terran side. Simply put, the show exhibits a war that is built by tension, executed by actions, and splashed onto the screen to show us what the consequences are. Still, characterization of a few select characters are memorable and makes us want to get to know more on both sides. There are credible themes involved that pushes the boundary of more than simply winning battles. And to top it all, the technical front of both artwork and soundtrack strikes out with strong impressions. In a way, Aldnoah Zero is a strange show with a curveball that balances itself between story and characters. It\u2019ll just take patience to get to know each other well.\\n\\n\r\nSeason 2 has been confirmed as the split-cour and to be honest with that ending, you better be in it for this wild ride.\\n",

            "content": "Hype, hype, hype. If one show received a huge ton of it this season, it was A-1 Pictures' Aldnoah.Zero. But is it as great as all the big names and the hype make it out to be? Well... not really, but it certainly was a good watch. Thanks for reading my review on Aldnoah.Zero!\r\nThe show takes place in an alternate reality, in which the Apollo 17 mission discovered a hyper gate to Mars on the surface of the Moon in 1972. After these events, the astronauts discovered the legendary \"Power of Aldnoah\", which made technology beyond our imagination possible. With this power in their hands,a lot of people settled on Mars, created the Empire of Vers and declared their independency from Earth. After years of conflicts, in 1999, a fight between humanity and the Empire of Vers caused the hyper gate to get destroyed and it took a huge part of the Moon with it, thus \"Heaven's Fall\" began and lots of the debris from the Moon landed on Earth, destroying whole cities and landscapes. Both sides had to take in massive casualties. After 15 years and a long time of ceasefire, the Vers princess was sent to Earth for a peace mission, but it didn't turn out as expected and the princess got assassinated and right after this, the Martian soldiers began to descend from the sky, riding steel giants, intent on exterminating humanity, taking revenge and conquering Earth for themselves once and for all.\\n\\n\r\nSounds pretty epic, huh? Granted, for the most parts the presentation of the show IS really epic, just assisted and maximized by Hiroyuki Sawano's fantastic soundtrack. While the plot concept sounds quite interesting, the execution is rather meh to say the least. This starts off with some pretty obvious info and exposition dumps and a rather predictable story layout in the beginning; new Martian super robot shows up, kills a lot of people, protagonist beats super robot with a \"clever\" tactic, the end. The show offers some plot twists here and there to keep you engaged, but they somewhat lack depth and impact for the most part, which really was a shame. This is mostly the fault of the anime's characters, as these are obviously the show's biggest downside.\\n\\n\r\nThe main protagonist Inaho is your typical \"2cool4u\" smart hero a l\u00e1 Lelouch, except that Lelouch actually has an understandable and relatable personality for the most part AND charisma. Inaho doesn't have that. A friend dies in front of his eyes; cool and straight face. He beats a bad guy's awesome robo; cool and straight face. He just saved someone's life and they are thanking him; cool and straight face. He is ice cold in whatever he does and this is what makes him distant and in my opinion completely unlikeable and unbearable as hell. I know he doesn't show his emotions from the outside and rather in his actions, but come on. Unrelatable and poorly written!\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast was average at best, with the best ones being Lieutenant Marito and Slaine Troyard. In the Lt.'s case his backstory of the war before the show started was really interesting to watch and how he had to deal with his PTSD, because he lost a precious friend to him back then. That's a more realistic depiction of PTSD compared to... other shows this season *cough* Sword Art Online II *cough*. Sometimes during the show, I wished he was the protagonist instead of Inaho, because he felt a bit more human. But of course, they didn't do anything with him, wasted potential. Slaine Troyard on the other hand was not that bad. He had an somewhat understandable motivation for doing what he does, his backstory was quite interesting - even if presented poorly. Compared to other shows he may still be meh at best, but together with the Lt. they made the otherwise trashy and forgettable cast of Aldnoah.Zero somewhat bette, but that doesn't say much. All in all the characters felt very flat, unengaging, plot-devicey and unlikeable.\\n\\n\r\nThe villains were mostly one-dimensional, cartoony cardboards, with little screentime or focus put on them and the rest of the supporting cast was either not really worth mentioning or spoiler territory.\\n\\n\r\nBut I could overlook some of the writing flaws and the characters for the sometimes godly action sequences. Yeah, the robots are made with 3DCG and tend to not blend in with the background well, but the action A-1 Pictures presented was mostly jaw dropping in my opinion, especially in episode 3 and the finale episode. And yes, I know that the \"tactics\" rival those from Code Geass, but if you turn your brain off and just embrace the action with Hiroyuki Sawano's masterful Original Score in the background, you can probably ignore those flaws as well and just enjoy the show. Of course the flaws wont disappear, but at least it makes it all the more enjoyable. Well, at least for me.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of visuals, Aldnoah.Zero looks really good and for the most part solid as well. The backgrounds are very detailed, the action is smooth and the colors bright. It only took me a while to get used to the kind of blobby character designs and especially in episode 10 there was a huge noticeable drop in animation quality. But thank god it was just for this one episode and the final episodes looked as amazing as they should.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I had a good time with the show and I looked forward to it almost every week. Probably it was the hype getting me fired up every time the fantastic OP by Kalafina started playing, but Aldnoah.Zero was one of the few shows of the season I really wanted to watch. The start was quite dull, then it got better for a long period of time, then it slightly dropped and the nice final episode made up for it. I know, it was mostly SHOCK FACTOR and Urobutcher being Urobutcher (well, Boku no Pico man trying to be Urobutcher), but the way the emotions of certain characters  came across really made my blood boil, but not completely in a good way. It somehow reminded me of Code Geass... weird, a lot of Code Geass comparisons in this review.\\n\\n\r\nWell, time for the verdict.\\n\\n\r\nDid I like Aldnoah.Zero? Sure, I did. Do I think it's a great show and everyone should watch it? Nah, no way. While you can (and most likely will) enjoy it as a brainless watch for tons of good looking and sounding action scenes, it falls flat in terms of good, consistent writing, offering a plot with at least some depth and even mediocre characters. Just don't take this show too seriously and embrace it as the stupid fun it is. Exactly as it was with Code Geass. DON'T PRETEND IT'S SMART!

            "content": "Great story, great art, great sound...questionably well played character development? Possibly.  Regardless, Aldnoah.Zero will probably be seen as an instant favorite to most anime lovers. It makes sure to get you attached, but not too attached to characters, and I put much emphasis on the 'too.'  Nevertheless here's my review continue to read to see if this show is for you. \r\nStory: 10/10\r\nI give this anime the benefit of the doubt strictly due to the fact that it was deeply implied that a season two would be coming, most likely this is the case. In fact as far as story is in generalit was very thrilling and can easily keep a viewer hooked even without the complete enjoyment of the person watching.  To be completely honest it was story that was seemingly most emphasized and because may have lacked in some other topics concerning this anime which will be discussed. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation, art, mechas, everything concerning this topic is well done, in fact other than some questionable angles and on occasion facial expressions, it is hard for me to dislike anything about this topic. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis topic is almost directly related to sound, perfection. From Aldnoah.Zero we get a visually stunning show as ear pleasing one.  The soundtrack that plays throughout the show greatly complements the battle sequences and mood no questions asked.  Even the sound effects concerning the show, whether it be action or casual in the scene, is good. No qualms should be met here. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned in the story topic, this anime does so well in so many criteria that is bound to be lacking even a little bit in something.  In Aldnoah.Zero we see a major emphasis on getting the story moving in earlier episodes but get very little in terms of character development.  In fact what can arguably be called the protagonist turns out to be one of the least interesting characters up til the end of the show. The viewer will no doubt be interested in other characters the story introduces because the are being more 'human'.  As an added note however this does play better for the story criteria, the show will make like certain characters and either pull a R.R. Martin, or make feel a little betrayed. HA! Focused character development can play with emotions, and for that I give the Character criteria a courteous score. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall I would call this show a very good anime, and I look forward to any progression in the story.   At the very least a season two, which the show so kindly introduced, will be very greatly desired.  Keep up the good work!",

            "content": "Out of an era where average Joe protagonists are given extremely powerful mechs to slaughter trained evil soldiers comes Aldnoah.Zero. What this show does to the mecha genre is ingenious. Instead of \"super badass op mech\" being the star of the show, have the trained soldiers systematically take down their overpowered opponents using strategy and planning. On top of this, Gen Urobuchi's setup of the story and his writing of the major events in the series are entertaining as usual. This show is a fantastic subversion of common tropes in mecha shows from years ago.\r\nStory- 8/10\r\nThe setup and world building of A/Z is well done.The first episodes are a great hook for the rest of the show by using shock and awe to portray how crazy the scale is. Nuking a major city on the first episode is guaranteed to at least catch your attention and make you curious about the possible resolutions to this huge conflict. \\n\\n\r\nThe split story-telling between our two protagonists, Slaine and Inaho, kept the show interesting. During calm periods in Inaho's story, something happens to Slaine, and vice versa. \\n\\n\r\nA major issue with the story however is that the big beefed up mechs are often beaten using coincidences or convenient plot devices. Some enemies are defeated in a more logical manner, while some lean closely to the \"asspull\" part of the gradient.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSave for Inaho, all of the characters feel real, likable, and relatable. Their relations, wants, needs, dislikes, goals, and personalities help bring you into the world of A/Z. Save for a few instances where a person snaps to help advance the main plot or a subplot, the characters all act rationally and use logic and strategy to the best of their abilities.\\n\\n\r\nThe common pacifist princess trope, Asseylum, is subverted into a character who detests war, but understands the necessity to fight back. Instead of being weak and worthless while crying about the war, Asseylum goes active as a part of a few operations over the course of the story. \\n\\n\r\nInaho, the highly trained Terran soldier, is an extremely hit or miss character. His emotionless efficiency was highly entertaining, but in a show where all the characters are well written and realistic, his presence slightly takes away from the atmosphere of the show. \\n\\n\r\nLastly, Slaine is the Terran who serves Asseylum and was initally with her at the beginning of the story. He is the irrational, impulsive, and emotional counterpart to Inaho's inability to care about anything. The differences in situation and Slaine's personality create a lot of duality in the story, which I really enjoyed.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation- 8/10. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is fluid, but there are a couple issues. A/Z doesn't really try anything new or eye-catching, simply resorting to the solid, fluid animation that we see in most anime today. The CGI mechs fit into the scene much more smoothly than many other shows, but it still doesn't quite feel right to see an animated character next to a CGI mech. The only other issue is that once or twice, it's difficult to understand what exactly happened on the screen until the character explain it for you, due to some chaotic moments passing by extremely quickly.\\n\\n\r\nSound- 10/10\\n\\n\r\nIt's rare for an OST to be the anchor that solidified such a high score for an anime many were underwhelmed by, but the fact of the matter is that this show has some of the best musical accompaniment I've ever had the pleasure of listening to. Combat scenes had excellent combat music. Psychological scenes had excellent psychological music. Tense situations had either no music or even better psychological music. I could go on and on but my point stands that this show's music is exceptional. \\n\\n\r\nOverall- 9/10\\n\\n\r\nWith the action scenes, well written characters, jaw-dropping OST, and interesting compelling war story, this show is extremely well done. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a war-time action show, mecha lover or not. This is not quite my anime of the season, but for what it's worth, it came pretty damn close.",

Once the war was over, the people of Earth realized that it lacked the weaponry for a potential second war.  It was during the fifteen years of peace that Earth began to advance in machinery and technology.  This advancement led to the development of giant Mechas.\r\nNow, in present day, our hero, Inaho (aka, \u201cEmotionless Boy/Gary Stu\u201d)spends time with his friends and sees the arrival of Princess Asseylum (aka, \u201cPrincess Pain in the Ass\u201d).  Meanwhile, our second \u201chero\u201d, Slaine (aka, \u201cTragic Boy/That F**k Up Boy\u201d) remains on the Vers spaceship, looking down at Earth with a sad face.  Suddenly, while Inaho and his friends watch the princess\u2019 arrival, a terrorist group assassinates the \u201cprincess\u201d (p.s. she\u2019s alive) and the Vers Empire retaliates.

            "content": "Before I start this review I wanted to let you know that I want to focus more of my time on the character portion of this show mainly because that is this shows biggest drawback. I will briefly go over the story, art, sound, and my overall enjoyment and score. But again I will be focusing more on the characters in this review. \r\nStory: Aldnoah.Zero is an obvious homage to the gundam series and it succeeds in creating very cool and interesting action scenes. This shows story is simple yet there are a lot of factors surrounding it that make is unique in it's ownright. In short words the story is good enough to keep you watching until the end but it isn't going to please everyone. \\n\\n\r\nArt: The art aside from the action sequences with the CGI, is very simplistic. The art I felt was perfect for the show. Especially the colors they chose. The colors in the art can be vibrant but also bleak and it adds to the show depending on the story. In short the art makes the show more enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nSound: This is by far the best part of Aldnoah.Zero. I loved every part of the soundtrack. I would definitely buy the OST and listen to it on a daily basis. The songs range from high octane vocals, to powerful orchestral pieces, as well as the calm and soothing songs that fit well and make the viewing experience an absolute blast. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Okay this is where it's going to get quite long. Now I want to get out that I feel as though the writers wanted to take these characters somewhere and wanted to have some depth, but that's all they really were, wants, and wishes. These characters are just boring empty shells that try to be this deep and complex character when they aren't. I specifically want to talk about Inaho as I believe contrary to almost everyone saying that he is the best character, Inaho is the worst character ever written in anime. Now that is taking it a stretch but I can't help but think that it's true. The writers were lazy, and didn't do anything with a character that showed promise. Inaho is just another typical badass silent type character. There are so many questions left unaswered that makes me just not care about Inaho. Why is he so good at that? Why is he so good at this? Why can he do this but nobody else can't? Why can this Highschool student do this? It's extremely pathetic and unacceptable that writers are just spoon feeding this crap to us. I felt no connection, and sympathy from him as a character. You can tell that the writers just want to do something with him but they just aren't doing anything. I believe that this is partially us, the anime communities fault. Instead of wanting well-written characters that have personalities, morals, and actual backstory we just want a badass character who pulls all the girls. Inaho was literally just used to push the plot forward and act on his own accord. Pretty much all the other side characters are equal with Inaho in every aspect, and when a supposed main character is about as interesting as a empty boring side character you have failed. Inaho has potential, but I found him to be the hardest thing to watch. In short I disliked Inaho as a character the most. The princess was also pathetically written, again other than having no reason in the story other than making it convenient for Inaho and the other people to proceed throughout the story in a boring one-dimensional way. \\n\\n\r\nNow there is a whole controversy with Slaine that has the anime community in a huge divide. I found that Slaine was the only decently well written character. He showed emotion, he went through hardships we got to see why he cares so much for characters, and we get to see him, grow as a character which makes me actually care for him. A lot of people tend to just hate on Slaine without really thinking about the things that he as a character has gone through and don't consider his standing on things. Instead he get's hated on by the community because he did something at the end that people didn't like. Slaine was written as a character that acts on emotions. It's extremely obvious that after being shot down by Inaho, for no good reason in an earlier episode, even after swooping down and helping him that he would not be on good terms with Inaho. Slaine shows some depth as a character and more promise than any other character in this show. Another descent character with potential is that one soldier guy who's friend died. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This show has it's moments, and when they happen they're an awesome spectacle. But I can't help but not enjoy this show because of how poorly the characters are done. You know the most important aspect of the show? \\n\r\nThis show had so much potential and it still might, due to there being a second season airing now. But this first season I can't help but say that I had a hard time watching it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: I find myself getting angry because this medium called anime that I grew up with is constantly getting worse. I grew up watching animes like Cowboy Bepop, Lupin the Third, and although those shows are from way back, \"The anime industry is changing\" isn't a valid excuse as to why we are getting crappy anime year after year. Aldnoah.Zero is a letdown overall. I wanted to enjoy this series, and occasionally I did, but it does so much wrong that I can't recommend it to anyone unless you are looking for a mech anime because you've seen every single other mech anime out there.",

            "content": "I hereby make another review co'z some pinche mod had a lot to say about my previous review, so, time to get down to business again.\r\nStory: First of all, the plot where it involves aliens invading earth was indeed pretty overrated, also, the theme of the anime was based on the classic Martian invasion. However, the scenario where, Princess Vers was able to escape from an assassination was pretty darn good to say the least and her wish to stop the invasion also adds to some good in it, even so, imo it wasn't enough that this anime's story would have a high score, soI'm gonna limit it to a 6.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Ok, so the art was the usual, I could have given it a 5, but after seeing how poor Princess Asseylum Vers Allusia and Rayet Areash shower scene, I've decided to limit it to a 4 and that's that, since I haven't seen some any good fanservice of the 2.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: I just like the opening theme and Princess Asseylum's cutsy voice, so a 7 for this part.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Now, I like the way Princess Asseylum was portrayed as this peace loving martian who some how was able to cheat death and Inaho for being this smartass who can operate a  Kataphract  and was able to kick them martians ass, however, the two mentioned characters where somewhat of a double standard, why? At first we saw the Princess who somehow was capable of hand to hand combat , but was unable to defend herself from Rayet's attack, we also see Inaho who was a good tactician, but  was unable to anticipate Slaine's assault. Also, we have Slaine, though at first we would have sympathize with him for being a Martian who was being bullied by the nobles, we were surprise that he is an earthling after all, but the biggest disappointment about him was despite of the maltreatment from the martian noble, he still sided with them. Basically his character was a surprise for us, now having mention the double standard portrayal of Princess Asseylum and Inaho, and the thing about Slaine, was basically the reason why I give this part a 6.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Because, it was the usual alien invasion kind of thing  based on a classic premise and it was more of a mini series than an episode, I would have dropped it already, but there is still that side of this anime where humans where able to win in the end and this is what kept me from dropping it, so I'm gonna give this part a 6.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Though, I gave the enjoyment part of this anime a 6, there were some question as to why original creator Gen Urobuchi gave this anime the title \"Aldnoah Zero,\" all we know is that it powers up the mech and the spaceship that them martians used, however we were left wondering as to what exactly is the \"aldnoah\" thingy, also, the synopsis of the anime stated that the martians were in fact humans who somehow discover some hyper-gate to Mars and when humans went there, they also discover advance alien tech, such synopsis basically puts a lot of plot holes in this anime as a whole,  now if some humans did migrated to mars and become martians, how the fuck can they have developed a kind of monarchical culture within a span of 15 years? Also, if humans where indeed able to discover advance alien tech, then surely earth would have also have access to it and develop such alien tech that would put them at par with the martians, having said that I'm gonna give this anime a 3. Now since this is only the first season, I wonder if we're ever gonna see Princess Asseylum  again? Also, there is no doubt that Saline is gonna be the next antagonist, but that's just my wild guess and not a spoiler. Now, I may have given this anime's overall a 3, but it doesn't mean that the rating applies to season 2, I hope we're clear.\\n\\n\\n\r\nHere are my rating post of this anime:\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fair 6\\n\r\nArt: Decent 4.\\n\r\nSound: Good 7.\\n\r\nCharacter: Fair 6.\\n\r\nEnjoyment Fair 6.\\n\r\nOverall: Poor 3.",

            "content": "Story - 9\r\nAldnoah.Zero is A-1 studios first attempt at a mecha anime. Though the plot is somewhat common, a group of individuals decide to fight against a stronger opposing force, in this case it\u2019s a civil war between Earth and a more technologically advanced Mars. The pace of the story is well done with back stories and exposition placed throughout the series in small amounts. The individual elements in the story are interesting and well worth watching. Each episode is unique and executed nicely with new twists every episode.\r\n\tEarth, having being devastated by Heavens Fall 15 years ago, sets up the plot for ongoing events.Tensions having risen for the past couple years between Earth and Mars a war begins to arise when the Princess of Mars arrives on Earth. Aldnoah.Zero follows the events of these characters throughout the war.\\n\\n\r\nArt \u2013 9\\n\r\nThe visuals are well done, creating unique characters and designs to distinguish between each opposing side. The technology and mecha are unique and are never the same. In addition, the use of color and lighting throughout the show gives the viewers a definite understanding of the devastation that has occurred in the past as well as the battles occurring in the present. Each scene was well drawn and directed including even the smallest of details, and the CGI used was not too overbearing. Character designs were well done each having a unique persona that represents themselves. The quality of animation presented by A-1 studios is definitely top tier.  \\n\\n\r\nSound \u2013 10\\n\r\nAldnoah.Zero features an absolutely amazing soundtrack and other various accompaniments that improve each scene by giving it more depth, even mediocre scenes are made great by inserting the OST into specific places. The music was well composed and directed by Sawano, Hiroyuki. Having directed several other series such as Guilty Crown and Kill la Kill. He makes excellent use of the music placed throughout the series. \\n\r\nThe opening song is also noteworthy being performed by Kalfina, the same people who sang the ending for Fate/Zero. Though I rarely pay attention to most music in the background, the music in this series stood out, sending out chills during battle scenes and other important scenes throughout the series. Having implemented a wide variety of sounds and styles used throughout the series, Aldnoah.Zeros soundtrack is very pleasing to the ear and definitely worth paying attention to throughout the series. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter \u2013 9\\n\r\nThe characters in this series are particularly interesting to keep an eye on. Inaho being one of my favorite MC this season, due to the fact that he uses his brain in contrast to the various other MC found in anime. Slaine also provides a unique perspective to the story. And the final MC Vers Allusia is a unique character that becomes the catalyst for all events in the story. The characters introduced throughout this series come from wide variety of backgrounds each providing a unique perspective to the story. We have characters ranging from being born on Earth, princess of mars and an Earthling raised my Martians. Each characters represent a different side of the story, the characters are well thought out and executed to play each specific role. The character development is well planned out and we learn more about them as the series progresses.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9\\n\r\nAldnoah.Zero was a great mecha series and one of my favorites of the summer season. The character Inaho was one of my favorite protagonist, not driven by emotions, but rather by pure thought. In addition the combination of great music as well as an interesting plot makes this an amazing anime. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9\\n\r\nAldnoah.Zero is a wonderful addition to the mecha genre, with unique characters and designs. This series was one of the most enjoyable of the season. Each element from sound, artwork and story were well executed. As well as including twists in each episode Aldnoah.Zero has been a wonderful anime to watch.\\n",

            "content": "In all fairness I thought that Aldnoah.Zero was a 7/10 anime throughout the whole series. I was pumped to watch the next episode, I thoroughly enjoyed the fight scenes and the artwork was almost at a level of perfection, but my overall was dropped because of the way the story was executed and played out throughout this anime.\r\nAt first I thought that the plot would fill up a fair bit of the anime instead of being based purely on the fight scenes and the war itself, yet I was slightly lead to disappointment in that component. \r\nThe part of the story which really threw thisanime out of place was most definitely the ending...  I genuinely believed that the ending was going to go smoothly and it would be all hunky dory, but then I was hit by a tsunami which crushed every bone in my body. It was by far one of the more horrible anime endings! I won't go into detail to explain why I thought the ending was horrible, but it was definitely a shocker in my eyes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I thought Aldnoah.Zero was an anime which had potential, but it just wasn't executed properly. I recommend watching Aldnoah.Zero, but brace yourself for the ending and the disaster of a story since they were the one of the biggest let downs you will ever face in anime.\\n\\n\r\nDon't hate me if you disagree, this is just my personal opinion.\\n\\n\r\nEDIT: I changed it from a 9/10 to a 7/10 because I felt as if a 9 was too high for this anime.\\n",

            "content": "Aldnoah Zero, the anime that broke my faith in Gen Urobuchi. Well, maybe just broke in a way that it can be glued back together, not shattered into dust. But yes, it did do some serious damage to my faith in the man and his writing ability (or rather, his plus the dude who wrote everyone's favorite anime recommendation, Boku no Pico.)\r\nI can't remember the last time I saw such boring, uncompelling characters. See, usually there's a reason, usually revealed through backstory, flashback, or infodump, about why a lead character would just mutter, \"Oh, a missile's coming\" the way you or I would say wesaw an interesting bird or car while walking down the street, the way our hero Inaho does in episode 1. We see his almost autistic state of mind helps him to keep his head cool in battle and devise Rube Goldbergesque strategies against the invading Martians. But like I said, non-autistic people tend to have some reason for this, and guess what. We're never given any reason why he acts this way. And given his ridiculous plot armor and damn near invincibility against what should be an unstoppable Space Nazi blitzkrieg (and for the first three episodes, the ones actually written by our headlining \"FROM THE CREATOR OF MADOKA MAGICA\" writer, it actually is) a rather fitting description comes up for Earth's Defender: Autistic Kirito. (And even then Kirito was at least given some justification for why he preferred to work alone.) It certainly doesn't help that after those three episodes have passed, the \"invincible\" Space Nazis suddenly start acting like typical mutton-headed villains of the week (or, well, like Hitler himself and his high command after Stalingrad), whom you wonder how they could have conquered their own underwear that morning, let alone their hated former home planet.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that of course brings you to the given backstory. Alien technology found on the last Apollo mission in 1972, including a stargate to Mars? Hey, it's science fiction. Humans have a (somewhat) functioning colony of several thousand on Mars by the '90s? Perhaps stretching things a bit, but remember those ancient astronauts. (Maybe that's how the Kyubeys got here. Maybe those ancient Martians WERE the Kyubeys, dun dun DUN!) The colonists gain magic powers via the alien technology? Still somewhat okay, I guess. By 1999 the colonists start to think of themselves as a racially superior separate species, including to some of their own living relatives back on Earth? (Even as of 2015, most of you reading this have some relatives who were alive in 1972, right? My own dad was 17 that year, the same age I was in '99! And his dad died in 2006, so even if he'd gone up into space at some point, taken some of that Kyubey tech...you get the picture.) As some other reviewers have opined, I might be able to see situation like that at least a thousand years down the road, but not 27. And then they blow up most of the moon, sending the fragments crashing down and devastating most of the continents (but largely sparing Japan for SOME reason). ...Yeah, we'd all be dead. The moon itself actually formed in a similar fashion, when a planet collided with Earth. It literally blasted off the young Earth's entire crust. Point is, even if the admittedly smaller moon fragmented and collided with Earth, chances are the effects would be much worse than even large bays where Los Angeles and Perth used to be.\\n\\n\r\nBut I could've forgiven this eye-rolling setup if only the characters hadn't all been buckets of dishwater, and the villains in the same caliber as Master Butterfly from SAO (IE, cackling obviously evil types whom you almost expect to should \"Curses! Foiled AGAIN!\" as Autistic Kirito sends them tumbling to their deaths). By the long-awaited end, well, you probably won't care in the least what happens to them, but you may find yourself asking, \"how, how in the name of O-Madoka-sama do you go from, well, Madoka to...THIS in just three years?\" Even Shyamalan, to whom Gen is often compared these days, had a five-year run before audiences started turning against him with The Village. Well, as Gen's defenders point out, he only wrote the first three episodes and provided a scant outline of the characters and plot points, the same tactic he used Gargantia to somewhat similar results. ...Yeah, you'd have to be blind to miss that pattern. Gen's relatively small involvement in both shows didn't stop Aniplex (and Kadokawa for Gargantia) from plastering \"FROM THE CREATOR OF MADOKA MAGICA\" on all the promos. It's certainly not the first time it's been done in anime or any entertainment (George Lucas and Howard the Duck, back when Lucas was still widely respected; John Travolta in the Quaaluded Moment By Moment), but it's still depressing as hell to see such a promising writer seeming to make the bait-and-switch his main career strategy (if it's a hit, sasuga Urobutcher; if it tanks, h-he only wrote the first few episodes, anta baka). At Shyamalan writes his scripts in their entirety on those occasions when he can find work.",

            "content": "Aldnoah the rip off by this Urobutcher'd Review:\r\nMINDSET:\r\nThe causals soon encounter the best mix of some of the most amazing staff members, we have the same script director of Boku no Pico (ok, lets ignore that one) We have the 3 legendaries of Anime script writing: Ei Aoki, the Urobutcher and Jin for the music, (who is better than Yujikadra) have now joined forces to become the Asian Writers League! The amazing trio of gangsters are in the midst on making the best Anime for your friends, your familly, your pets, your grand parents, your teacher, your ex-girlfriend and even the prostitute You picked up5 years ago!\\n\\n\r\nSYNOPSIS:\\n\r\nApparently Martians come down from the moon to kill people, for apparently \u201cFood and Culture\u201d but the biggest difference between whats a human (Terran) and a martian is that despite that they both look alike, the martians are a technological advance species whose only difference is that they can breath in space and that they can operate a super over powered mechas known as \u201cAldnoah\u201d for the few who can operate such a machine has high status from their political ladder, while the Terrans just have these misely little mechs who apparently wield giant machine guns, the martians land down to Earth to declare war for chances of them to fulfil more food and culture on to themselves.\\n\\n\r\nREVIEW:\\n\r\nFirst off, the protagonist may show little to know mercy and is completely OP but is utterly lifeless, like You see his friend dying at the first episode and he doesn\u2019t even change he's expression! He has no personality, at all, which makes him boring and the audience to not care. Ladies and gentlemen, I present to You a story that is purely of lazy, choppy and sometimes predictable piece of horrendous writing from this uncanny valley from these retards that created Aldnoah.\\n\\n\r\nRight at the first episode, it may not be predictable, but it always seemed so into the face when I see at how \u201cMoronic\u201d Urobutchi and he's Boku friend  can pull out so many forced plot points.\\n\\n\r\nSure, the story is unpredictable, but all I see is a bunch of unpredictable ass pulls! Like You see this one dimensional villain going all we need to capture planet Earth so we can have more food, then a few episodes later, he dies, but another villain just taken he's place and its like You can just let the first main villain to not exist at all. Which makes so, sooo many characters completely useless other than being a backdrop or being used for future plot holes that are forcefully coming out of nowhere.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing that motivated me on watching the later episodes was the the premise seemed interesting. It has a lot of potential to be one of those greats. But of course, this is a \u201cPopular\u201d modern Anime with loads of hype surrounding it so I can already predict a sh*t storm narrative miles away, but if it really needs to strive to be greater, it must be more respectful towards its audience and show depths of realism and especially not pull out any plot devices out of the forced dimension! (and a million other jazz) and consequently, this \u201cever\u201d happens to mainstream shows.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of how utterly useless a large portion on what actually seemed to be the \u201cMain Cast\u201d the characters don't really have much use at all, there often the 20% who are taking action, or the 80% who barely have a role to the story and are just there for plot convenience, like how these teenagers who are friends with the protagonist who you could think they have loads of screen time for supporting the protagonist, but are really just there to operate whatever machine the good guys use. They are really just  a majority of characters like these who feel just as lifeless and uncared for as the main, yeah, You may counter saying that he changes facial expressions, or boast at how OP he is and that he's like one of the Earth biggest hope for survival but there is clearly nothing to explore his context, his nature, back story, personality, motives and just feels like an empty shell that simply reacts with only having the complexity of damn Smurf! The 99.9% of this side cast is stupid writing. Period.\\n\\n\r\nThe shows logic feels completely stupid, I already went through enough pain by how forced fed we are by the plot, but is'nt this supposed to be part of a massive planetary war against humans and martians and jazz? Then how come we could really accept the realism if there just a bunch of teenagers? Oh wait, its because they flipping sell. (DUUUUHHH)\\n\\n\r\nWhen You think about a full on Sci-Fi war against two divided races, there has to be some good tension that will provide a higher level of entertainment and satisfactory, but so many of the issues of the show can all be pointed at the claim that its just too forced. Plot holes can be thrown out of nowhere and be patched up with a BS explanation that forces us to accept it as actual logic, Side characters are plot devices, the so-called \u201cEpic Twist\u201d feel rather unnatural and downright moronic, characters get barely to no development and it all feels like a large mess for no one to even care or mind about. This show is without a doubt one of the best examples of how much Urobuchi makes stuff up, and makes them look more like plot devices than actual characters!\\n\\n\r\nYes, Slain seems to be the only good character unlike the pussies who just sit there and do nothing but sob for reasons we don't care about and he actually takes action with a reasonable motive, though he can be a bit corny, he still is a million times better than everyone else. However, one character cannot suffice a million other horrible ones, and they might as well all go to a hentai  and the show is probably better if Princess Seylum was tentacle'd by the evil knight leaders because I don't care, and she's protected by plot armour. And she is almost a plot device character!\\n\\n\r\nActually, did anyone notice that in the OP  when You see Seylum lying on a small puddle that her bra was off when we see her whole body on a birds eye view, or was it me? Well, the music is pretty damn good, though it is pretty sad that I don't get to hear the OST alone in my own pleasure for free, but at least the OP still retains that Kalafina awesomeness we all love, though additively it is starting to feel like that same exact style going to repeated over and over again, with the usual electric guitar and piano into the mix, with that amazing voice that I won't seem to actually get bored of until another a year or two.\\n\\n\r\nA-1 Pictures does seem to understand how to animate a damn good looking show, but this is 2010's so what do You expect the narrative substance would be? Any how, the slightly varied designs feel quite lazy, characters don't tend to have memorable designs which Perfectly blends in on being plot devices, and its like You can simply tell which character plays a larger role if they seem to have a slight variation of hair colour or the fact that she's \u201cPrettier\u201d than the reset of the girls. Mecha designs kind of suck around the latter parts like that wierd tripod who can only shoot lasers, but, I do see effort and creativity with these massive legged robots and I am definitely no mecha fan boy nor I find the designs hugely appealing, but they are real good for what there worth, and the budget seems very consistent with the action scenes looking really cool. The strategies feel a bit stupid with the teenagers just doing all the dirty work, but the choreography and overall feel of the Animation and show in general makes for a fairly immersive experience in a visual stand point. The CGI looks stupid BTW.\\n\\n\r\nLEGACY:\\n\r\nAnd this is why we don't use the script director of Yaoi hentai to make proper sh*t up! Just love it from the garnishing of the Animation and to see how utter retard this team of producers cen get. I'd be bored out of my mind watching such a horrible show, though because of how turd the hype was it is a very, very bloody endeavour for me to anti-forget such a show from that over killing hype... Hopefully I'll forget it once I die.\\n\\n\r\nSCORES:\\n\r\n2.5/10 \u2013 The characters are stupidly pointless\\n\r\n3/10 \u2013 The story is just an entire assh pull!\\n\r\n7/10 \u2013 Great animation, but corny CGI.\\n\r\n7/10 \u2013 Kalalalalalalafina!\\n\r\n2.5/10 \u2013 ONE OF IF NOT, THE MOST BORING SHOW OF SUMMER 2014.\\n\\n\r\nFINALE: 3/10 \u201cLet justice be done, though the heavens fall....\u201d Thats it! Now Your just making stuff up for everyone to awe at for a lousy quote that might as well say \u201cDirected by Boku No Pico, now shut the hell up and give me money!\u201d",

            "content": "[Adapted From Original Blog Post]\r\nExpectation, for anything really, is a really dangerous thing to have when going to any anime. I may have made this point before, but that's because it's true, starting an anime with the mindset that it will either be amazing or crap can influence your opinion on it when it ends. The problem with this of course is that you may lose sight of how good the show actually is; this is a common problem with the landmark anime like Cowboy Bebop or Neon Genesis Evangelion, it's because they are so hyped up that some people may watch them and thinkthey weren't all that great. This may be a trap I have fallen into myself with my viewing of Aldnoah.Zero, the latest brainchild of Gen Urobuchi that aired this past 2014 Summer anime season, and was possibly one of my most hyped anime of the entire year. And why not? This is a show that had absolutely everything going for it; an interesting premise, awesome animation, a top-notch writer, and music that features easily some of the most pulse-pounding awesome songs this year. But after I finished Aldnoah.Zero last week, I leaned back from my monitor, pondered for a moment, and thought, \"where'd did it all go wrong?\" Hopefully today, I can answer because that question. It just might be a little hard, since I can't deny the little things the anime does right.\\n\r\n     Hello people of \"The Wired\", my name is Quan, I hope you're doing awesome, and I'm sorry about the month anime review hiatus I've been on. Hopefully you've enjoyed the other posts in that time, but I swear it won't be long before the next review: which may or may not have something to Kyoto Animation again. Today I'm going to be tacking the sci-fi mecha quandary that seems to have split opinions with a lot of people: Aldnoah.Zero. Here we go.\\n\\n\r\nLet's talk technical for a couple minutes shall we? Aldnoah.Zero was brought to life by a partnership of both the heavily celebrated A-1 Pictures, those gentleman whose works include Sword Art Online, Anohana and Shinsekai yori, as well as the newly formed Studio TROYCA, meaning that Aldnoah.Zero stands right now as their only full-scale work. It was directed by the one and only Ei Aoki, that awesome person who directed Kara no Kyoukai: Overlooking View and Fate/Zero, as well as a couple others that I don't care to mention due to their unimportant nature. And yes, that's not a good thing. The series creator is of course Gen Urobuchi, the writer who brought us Madoka Magica, Psycho-Pass and Fate/Zero as well, so you can see why I have a lot of expectation for this guy. However, while Urobuchi did write episodes 1-3 of the anime, the actual script for Aldnoah.Zero was handled by Katsuhiko Takayama, who has written scripts such as ef: A Tale of Memories, the original Fullmetal Alchemist, Toyko ESP...and Boku no Pico...which is interesting to say the least. And once again, the anime aired this summer through July 6 to September 21, and was a mere 12 episodes. Now, onto the plot.\\n\\n\r\nIn an alternate present day Japan, Earth holds an uneasy truce with the Vers Empire, humans who migrated to Mars in 1972 to claim an ancient and powerful technology known only as \"Aldonah\", which allows their technology to forward at an impossibly quick rate, granting things such as mechas. The princess of Vers is intent on rekindling peace between the two planets, now 15 years after a war broke out between Mars and Earth, resulting in thousands dead and the moon being destroyed in a near-apocalyptic event known as Heaven's Fall. However, peace negotiations break down quite quickly as the Vers princess is assassinated, causing the Vers Empire in fury to launch a full scale attack on Earth, this time to destroy all inhabitants and claim the planet with their vastly superior technology granted by Aldnoah. In the chaos we are introduced to our main protagonist: Inaho Kaizuka, a top grade high-school student who, with his friends, misses the first evacuation wave and is caught up along in the chaos of war, but at the same time discoveres a secret that reveals that the war might not be all that it seems. At the same time on Mars, a close friend of the princess named Slaine Troyard is uncovering the same secrets, secrets which could topple the Vers Empire, and get himself killed.\\n\r\n     And yeah, for the first 3 or so episodes the plot is rather effective. The sequence of when the Vars Empire start to descend on Earth and take out all the major cities Independence Day style, paired with the awesome music easily gets my vote for one of the most epic string of scenes for the year, all brought to life by the high quality animation A-1 and TROYCA have provided. We also are introduced to a conspiracy that  a trigger-happy Vers Empire may have killed their own princess as an excuse for a vendetta against Earth, mostly established from Slaine's point of view on the other side of the battlefield. It's also hard not to be intrigued by Inaho's character right off the bat, because even if he seems to have the personality of hand-rag,  he takes down a seemingly invincible enemy mech using pure brain power, and that's kind of cool, at least it is at first. However, after Aldnoah.Zero sets up all these intriguing threads, with mysterious character motivation, conspiracies, and a few plot-twists, it then proceeds to play it safe, and in doing so, quite spectacular loses the most traction and kinetic energy I've ever seen in an anime in such a short amount of time since Mirai Nikki......and we all know how Mirai Nikki turned out. Though to be fair, I'm pretty sure the ending of Aldnoah.Zero is even worse.\\n\\n\r\nThe most frustrating part is that the plot isn't even that bad. The bigger picture of what's actually going on with the war is fairly interesting, but the biggest problem Aldnoah.Zero has is that the cast of characters it has simply aren't likable or well-developed enough to carry the narrative onward, because for me, there wasn't any particular reason why I should care about any of them, especially the main protagonist Inaho who I'm pretty sure has the same blank expression on his face for almost the entire series, even if an angry Martian is about to smash his face in with a mech. Now I know I'm getting ahead of myself here, we'll get to the character section of this review in a minute, but really it's the character's fault that the plot fails. Aldnoah.Zero did half the work if you like, setting a decent story up, but not giving us characters who we want to see it through with. Don't get me wrong, a cast of unlikable characters can sort of, kind of work, but the fact that they're so underdeveloped gives them no saving grace, and just leaves us with a group of thoroughly nasty people. \\n\r\n     Getting back on topic with the plot however, the anime just seems to lose all of its passion after that 3 episode run. As the show progresses, it starts becoming fairly formulaic for a couple of episodes, where a new solider of Vars comes in to attack Inaho and his friends, and then Inaho comes up with some plan to stop said solider, which he does, and rinse and repeat for about 5 episodes or so. And no matter how much the music is trying to tell me whatever is going on is absolutely amazing, I just can't get hyped about whatever is happening when I've seen it happen already, and explained by a protagonist who doesn't really seem to care about it. Granted, I will admit, the first battle sequence in episode 3 is awesome and clever, and even prompts that Inaho might be some kind of unassuming bad-ass, but again, it just happens over and over after that. Not only this, but clich\u00e9s and fanservice start creeping in the mid-to-late stages of the anime, which basically just killed any optimism I had left for the show. I mean come on guys, you made Fate/Zero, you don't need to rely on this crap! Things do start to pick up once the final goal of the story has been established and faith for humanity is restored, because it's here when the action really starts picking up for the show, and for the first time, the show actually begins to gain some structure as the last few episodes start building and building towards this final point. We do also get a kind of lame \"surprise\" villain at this point(I say surprise in quotations because the anime really doesn't make any effort to hide who the bad guy is), but I didn't mind too much because the show was finally starting to peak my interest for the first time since the opening episodes...and then the ending happened. Now, let me get something clear. Yes, I have been known to blow certain things out of proportion in the past, but seriously, I don't exaggerate when I say that the show quite completely falls apart in the final episode, and then pulls a completely out of nowhere ending that just feels like it's there for the shock alone. And yeah it's shocking, but that really doesn't make it any more stupid or just plain lazy writing.\\n\r\n     And you know, it's kind of easy here just to let Urobuchi off the hook here and blame it all on Takayama. After all, the first 3 episodes, the only ones Urobuchi is actually credited with writing, are by far the best of the anime, but he's not completely without blame here. True, it was actually Ei Aoki who came up with a lot of these weak characters, and it was Takayama who is responsible for the poor writing later on in the series, but Urobuchi is, after all, the \"original creator\". He must have had some say in how the plot progressed from those initial episodes, so congratulations guys, Aldnoah.Zero failed, and it's everyone's fault. Well, maybe fail is a strong word. Before I bash on the show too much, particularly in this section coming up, I just wanted to get out there that the plot really isn't all that terrible, and there are a couple good moments in between the beginning and the lead up to the end that are very well done. They just aren't nearly as common as I would hope for. \\n\\n\r\nThis is where Aldnoah.Zero truly fails I'm afraid: the characters, and this is the most obvious with our main character Inaho. You may have noticed I've been taking shots at him already through this review, so it's time to say why I just don't like this guy, and the reason is the most obvious one, a detail you'll pick up quickly after watching him for a couple minutes. No matter what is happening and no matter who is attacking him, Inaho shows practically no emotion at all. He always has this bored look on his face, even when he sees his friends die in front of him in the early episodes. Sure he might grit his teeth for a second when in battle or something, but mostly, he just delivers his lines with no emotion at all, and this just makes him boring in the end. His only defining feature his intelligence, which he uses along with his calm demeanor in battle to take down the enemy, usually with actually smart tactics that you can appreciate. Now, emotionless characters can work, for example Yuki Nagato in The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, as long as their behavior is justified, but with Inaho, we never really learn why he acts like this. Seriously, is this a childhood trauma effecting him? Why is he so emotionally distanced to everything? I never found out. Sure, Inaho might have the occasionally spark of personality when talking to his sister Yuki Kaizuki, but in the end, I spent all of the anime waiting for some kind of emotional outburst from him which never came. I just don't know what the creators are thinking with this character, his only redemption at this point could be a more detailed back-story in the second season of Aldnoah.Zero which will be airing this winter, though judging how the anime ended, that seems a little unlikely.\\n\r\n     As for Slaine Troyard...well I almost hesitate to call him a character rather than a plot device. Why do I say this? Well, as far as I can tell, he only exists in the series for one purpose at the very, very end, I'm talking the last few seconds here, but I'll won't elaborate due to spoilers. I suppose if you take him at face value though, he's a OK character. He's defined by his unyielding loyalty(and possible romantic affection) to the princess of Vers: Asseylum, who he owes everything to due to an event in the past, and yeah, that's basically all his character. Don't get me wrong, I like him to an extent, he's brave and headstrong at the very least, and one of the few people who actually tries to uncover the truth behind the princesses' murder, but yeah, that's all he has going for him. It wouldn't even be so bad if he actually did something throughout the anime, but he's kind of held in limbo for the entire time until the end, where he really has nothing else to do besides question the morality of the war. There is one point in episode 6 where you think he's actually going to meet up with the rest of the plot, but like a dog on a leash he's yanked almost instantaneously to where he was before,  as if the creators are saying: \"no, you're not important until the end, go away.\" Again though, we'll see where his character goes in the sequel.\\n\r\n     I'm a little hesitant to talk about this last character since it is technicality a spoiler for episode 2 of the anime, but she's arguably the best character in the show, and besides, the anime makes no effort to keep this a secret(both the OP and ED especially), but if you really don't want to know anything, you can go ahead and skip this paragraph. Basically though, the twist at the end of episode 2 is that the Vers princess: Asseylum is still alive, a copy being sent in her place on the day of the assassination. As you can imagine, this opens a whole new side to the plot, as the princess goes undercover with Inaho and the rest of the United Earth forces in an attempt to contact her grandfather and stop the war. At first, I thought her a little generic, just a typical perfect princess archetype that only disguising feature was her want for peace between Earth and Vers, but I later found out she's a lot more complex than she first appears. She harbors a strong guilt; blaming herself for the war because it never would have occurred if she had never gone down to Earth for peace talks, and her entire ark is basically her confronting that everything isn't going to work out and not everyone particularity wants peace between the two planets. We see her get increasingly frustrated by the lack diplomatic discussion or effort of both Earth and Vers, which eventually reaches a breaking point near the end of the anime, which I thought was probably the most subtle and best character moment of the show. And hey, she's also pretty awesome with hand-to-hand combat. If there's one thing that doesn't work with her character, it's the implied romance between her and Inaho, which really dies. After all, it's kind of hard to have chemistry between two characters when one of them is basically a robot, and it just doesn't work. It's clear that Slane deserves her if anybody, considering all he goes through throughout the course of the anime just to protect her, including being tortured... though even that's kind of hard to buy since the two only have about two scenes together in the anime. But I digress.\\n\r\n     The rest of the supporting cast is fairly unremarkable, not even having any real standouts. As I said, the villain who enters later isn't really anything to talk about, and the rest of the cast like the rest of the United Earth officers and Inaho's classmates really don't contribute much of anything to the story either. If I had to choose a standout, a sub-plot of sorts involving a retired Earth officer named Koichiro Marito whose struggling with PTSD from the first Vers-Earth war. And yes, while that is fairly interesting, it really doesn't seem to relate to the main story at all besides from giving us some exposition on the events revolving around Heaven's Fall.\\n\\n\r\nAs I've stated before, the animation is awesome. The shows looks amazing, typical of A-1 pictures, and hey, maybe this is a standard we can expect from TROYCA as well in the coming years. The action of the show is fast-paced and exciting, which is good for a show with so much of it. Colors are relatively mellow, yet get more expressive on Mars, where purples and greens start making the world feel a little more surreal, though I feel like the design for the show, especially considering it is sci-fi, could have been a little better. Everything feels a little borrowed from other things, including the shattered moon in the sky which is really supposed to be the anime's identifiable setting center-piece, looks cool, but other more creative measures could have been taken to make the world feel a little more original. But now I'll stop dancing around the topic and address what was undoubtedly one of the biggest controversies animation-wise before this show started airing. Yes, the kataphrakts(which is just a fancy word for mechs) are rendered with CG, which some might view as devil's spawn when paired with typical animation. I will admit I'm not the biggest fan of CG myself, it always looks a little too clunky and out of place when placed in a 2-D environment, and it can break immersion just because of how noticeable it is most of the time. However, while it might take a little getting used to in Aldnoah.Zero, I can say that much for it, you do get used to it and accept it as a part of the show. It doesn't really add anything a typical drawn mech wouldn't have, but it does sort of solve that problem of the world feeling a little uninspired that I mentioned before. However, if you really aren't one who can stand CG, this is going to be a huge problem if you decide to watch the show, because unlike other times when CG has been integrated into anime sparingly, the kataphrakts are a huge part of the show and kind of hard to miss.\\n\\n\r\n Let's talk about Hiroyuki Sawano's music, which at this point, I consider to be some of my favorites of any composer. I mean, just look at this list of prestigious soundtracks he's done: Kill la Kill, Guilty Crown and Attack on Titan, which may I add, are all amazing soundtracks in their own right. And now, I'm delighted to say he hasn't run out of steam quite yet, because Aldnoah.Zero's OST, while it might not be the best he's ever done, is still probably going to be one of the best of the year. Sawano just knows how to make his music sound cool, whether that be by mixing different languages or just adding an epic beat so you love the song regardless. Personal favorites form this soundtrack include a song entitled \"I Say Cry\", which plays during that previously mentioned scene when Vers are first attacking Earth, which yes, I know is everyone's favorite song from this soundtrack, but hey, it's epic. Also, the first ED titled \"A/Z\" is a lovely little song, that was actually co-created by Sawano himself and Mitzuki. The OP for the anime: \"heavenly blue\" was done by Kalafina, and while I like it a lot, I'm just saying it sounds really similar to Fate/Zero's first OP \"oath sign\". That may be because Yuki Kajiura, who is doing the \"theme song arrangement\" for \"heavenly blue\" worked on that OST as well. \\n\\n\r\nAldnoah.Zero is the perfect example of an anime which had too much hype surrounding it when it started, and now I don't think the public majority's opinion of it is that great, now that it has finished airing, which is a shame, because it doesn't deserve(all) the hate it has gotten. I mean, it has great music and animation, bundled with a decent plot, I just think that the characters may have pissed everyone off, not that I blame them. So I'm going to try to remember Aldnoah.Zero in a more positive light, and remember the good things rather than the bad, because there is good in it, and it needs to be acknowledged. You don't need to love it, I don't, but it a little slack. Though rage all you want about the ending, because that was literally the worst. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: 6(.5)/10\\n\\n\r\nP.S: So what, she's died three times now?\\n\\n\\n\r\nFor this review and others, feel free to check out my blog!

            "content": "In a Nutshell:\r\nAldnoah.Zero holds a very special place in my heart, it really does. How one anime can so comprehensively screw up in every department, that actually matters, is beyond me. It is a feat not even the great Koi to Senkyo to Chocolate was able to achieve. So unmitigated is this disaster that I think its required viewing for anyone interested in knowing how NOT to write an anime. Everyone else would probably be better off watching boku no pico.\r\nThe Review:\r\nAldnoah chronicles a war that breaks out over the attempted assassination of the Martian princess, Asseylum, who was on a diplomatic mission to improverelations between the Terrans and the Martians. Tensions between the two factions had apparently been escalating ever since the last war, which purportedly took place 15 years prior the series. This is all the information we get before the anime becomes a tedious string of action sequences, interlaced with uninteresting conversations and nearly useless infodump sections. As a result, we learn barely anything about the political and economic conditions surrounding the conflict. But hey, who gives a damn if the plot is paper thin and has holes the size of Jupiter, as long as there are you have badass explosions, and a cast of high school students to boot!\\n\\n\r\nThe anime focuses on a handful of characters at the expense of all other aspects of the so-called war. So you would think the writers would put at least SOME effort into developing them, right? Heh, WRONG! In fact, Aldnoah has plot devices instead of 'characters.'The biggest problem with the cast is undoubtedly its size. There are simply way too many characters for a 12 episode show to handle properly. As a direct result, most of them end up being extras with no personalities whatsoever. Strangely enough, the 'main' characters don't fair any better. Inaho, the protagonist of this trainwreck, is the most lifeless individual I have seen to date. If he were to be replaced by one of the mechs, you would've have a really hard time telling the difference. This is helped by the fact that the apathetic idiot sounds as if he were voiced by a text-to-speech software. for someone labelled as the protagonist, Inaho doesn't really do much besides delivering exposition during battles. He doesn't even get into a relationship for god's sake! Even the most generic ecchi anime has a lead more human than this bag of bones.\\n\\n\r\nThe Martian side of things is even worse, believe it or not, when it comes to the character department. This entire faction seems to be comprised of disagreeable individuals, who are bent on starting a war with the Terrans. Moe Mars princess, (Asseylum) and Slaine, the Terran who was 'saved' by her, are apparently the only people who have a conscience. Asseylum is clearly the more annoying of the two. The anime tries to portray her as a pacifist, an angel among demons, if you will. This probably could've worked if the writers had bestowed her with an appropriate back story. But as it stands, she's a walking, talking, collection of cliches. Given the princess' fetish for Terrans, I fully expected a relationship to blossom between her and Slaine. But the guy is busy with plot device duties throughout the series, you see. His sole purpose seems to be accentuating the inhumane nature of the Martian gentry, by being repeatedly beaten and tortured. You actually feel sorry for him until you realize it's just too contrived to take seriously. The very notion that he suffers all this abuse right under Asseylum's nose is preposterous. Why couldn't the idiot just go and tell her about his misery. There is absolutely no reason for the dim-witted Terran to suffer in silence. Oh wait, there is, SHOCK VALUE!\\n\\n\r\nAldnoah zero is yet another series which squandered its potential because of lazy writing. It literally offers NOTHING of value in terms of plot and characterization. Not even the flashy visuals and catchy soundtrack can save this one from my shit list.",

            "content": "I'll focus more on the bad, since the good was covered everywhere. It's full of optimistic reviewers out there, but for the people who need to get into a show with appropriate expectations in order to enjoy it, I present to you a review with a focus on the bad.\r\nThe show reminds me of Guilty Crown. Many make parallels with Code Geass as well, although comparing it to Code Geass is an insult to the latter. The similarities to Guilty Crown are a lot more apparent, though. Aldnoah.Zero is pretty much Guilty Crown without the overly complicated plot and the awesome animation. The animation isgood, don't get me wrong, but it's not up to par with GC. The CGI use for Kats (mechas) depends on your taste.\\n\\n\r\nPlot 5/10\\n\r\nA.Z should be called Swiss cheese the Anime. The plot is riddled with plot holes. Most of the laws of physics are completely ignored, which is more annoying when they decide to invoke them first. The best example would be the piece of armor that supposedly absorbs all light but somehow is visible in all its purpleness, rather than being pitch black. Oh, it also goes: \"The law of conservation of energy? Never heard of it!\"\\n\r\nThe entire reason for the invasion of Earth is stupid as well. \"The Call To Arms\" song details the motivation of Saazbaum and the Orbital Knights. While those motivations are understandable in their given situation, their given situation is absurd. Had they not decided to put in practice their brilliant idea to declare independence from Earth when they weren't autonomous from it at all they wouldn't be in the situation in the first place. But I guess not everyone is as smart as the American colonies.\\n\r\nThe Earth armies are nothing more than the Mecha equivalent of WH40K Imperial Guardsman bayonet charging a bunker. Earth never seems to evolve from the tactic of throwing conscripts at tanks hoping their mangled bodies will eventual clog up the threads. The fact that a bunch of highschoolers are more capable at destroying the enemy than the actually army is hilarious, and gets even more so when you realize that they MC is not necessarily a genius, he's just surrounded by idiots.\\n\r\nAnd the ending? I don't want to spoil it\u2026 but it reminded me of School Days.\\n\r\nAnd all of the above wouldn't be so bad if not for the character development, or better said, lack thereof.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 5/10\\n\r\nBy the end of the show I realized I barely knew most of the recurring characters. Not even the MC gets that much development. Frankly, we get more development and interaction from the antagonists. Most of the backgrounds of the secondary characters are left unexplored. I waited for some development of the relationship between Lt. Marito and the Captain, but it remained unexplored. I fail to understand why it was started in the first place. The so-called reveal of the Captains identity was utterly pointless other than to create a twist. It all fells like an introduction and I can only hope that it all gets fixed and explained in the second season.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\r\nThe music was pretty good. Opening and endings were enjoyable and the OST has quite a few epic tracks. Again, reminds me of Guilty Crown.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment 6/10\\n\r\nBetween the plot holes, missed opportunities and lost potential, the show quite disappointed me. But it was mostly because I went in with too high expectations. Don't make the same mistake.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 6/10\\n\r\nAll in all, A.Z has a lot of good ideas, but aims too high and fails miserably. Can still be quite enjoyable and I'd recommend you watch it. You'll probably like it more than me.",

            "content": "Aldnoah.Zero is essentially a story about an all-out war between two civilizations, and it seeks to show why war and conflict is, however tragic, unjust and cruel, is also unavoidable. \"War is merely a physical negotiation. It only ends when the goals are met, or when the cost of human life outweighs the benefits.\" In this sense, war is merely economic in nature, and hence completely natural.\r\nTL;DR\r\nStory: 5/10\r\nArt: 10/10\r\nSound: 10/10\r\nCharacter: 4/10\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\r\nOverall: 7/10 (rounded up from 6.75)\r\nGood points:\r\n+ Great action scenes with Kataphrakts (Gundams)\r\n+ Influential female main and support cast\r\n+ Great tactical strategies employed in battle (Inaho)\r\n+ Great OP and ED themes\r\n+ Moral discourse aboutwar\\n\\n\r\nBad points\\n\r\n- Unsatisfactory ending\\n\r\n- Lack of character depth and growth\\n\r\n- Not very coherent plot\\n\r\n- Interchangeable and linear antagonists\\n\\n\r\nPlot: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe main basis of Aldnoah.Zero's plot is race, known as the Versians, or Martians, who have every intention to take over Earth. Their military, known as the Orbital Knights from 37 clans, has a few traitors who devise a plan to stage the assassination of their own princess, to use as an excuse to go to war with earth. The Terran (earthlings) struggle to survive the best as they can, and the princess herself (who wants peace with the Terran) makes several futile attempts to end the drawn-out conflict.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot as a whole was alright, who doesn't love all-out war between two races, whereby the main protagonist faces impossible odds to try and defend against countless attacks. The plot shines at its best when we see Inaho outsmarting the Martians by analysing the weaknesses of their special Aldnoah powers - a total of 4, including the last one Martian Kataphraks (Kats) were defeated by him, and through pretty believable means. It was also exciting enough to watch how Inaho does all of this, through testing, analysis of how the enemy attacked...etc, so that was really good. I looked forward to seeing Inaho's plans in battle, and he is in every battle (+3)\\n\\n\r\nThe depth of the plot is deeper than at first glance. The first feel of it is a \"strategy-battle\" anime, but as the plot thickens, the anime introduces discourse about the moral implications of war, whether war is justifiable and/or unavoidable. Unfortunately, it doesn't go any deeper than that. There are a few plot twists within, but most of which were unnecessary and honestly didn't add much to the story. So captain Magbaredge was actually the sister of Humeray, and like WOW, at first, but after that you realize that it doesn't add anything to the plot. (+1)\\n\\n\r\nNot only that, but as it turns out, Cruhteo turns out to be a real good guy in this anime, that could be a start of a pro-Terran martian force! Wait no, he gets immediately put down and crushed by Saazbaum, without so much as a chance to see him in action inside the Tharsis.\\n\\n\r\nAs for whether the plot made sense? I was doubtful at first, but when I went to google everything that Inaho talks about - the Leidenfrost effect, the Rayleigh and Mie scattering, as well as everything about the dimensional barrier, shows that the author actually knows what these things are and wasn't just throwing off scientific turns like smoke bombs. Still, it would have been ALOT better if the anime at least made the main character EXPLAIN what these effects are, because it would make alot more sense to the audience as well as the other characters in the show who probably don't know anything about superheated plasma, if you know what I mean. (+1)\\n\\n\r\nCoherence is largely there - and I liked how most of the plot unfolded in a reasonable fashion. However, there are some key points where it seems to fall through. At first, there was a whole talk about how, if the Princess shows that she is alive, the war would somehow end. This ended up to be a disastrous plan and it did nothing whatsoever, even to the point that her own grandfather would continue the war, fully knowing that he was essentially murdering his own granddaughter. Like uhh... what? And I also heard that Vers is using a feudal system, meaning that they are supposed to listen/respect/protect the royalty, but I guess not in this case then. They are too busy with their clan rivalry to care about who is running the country at all.\\n\\n\r\nNext, although I can accept that idea of Aldnoah as a type of unlimited energy source, I can't accept it's activation key. Apparently, Rayregalia was bestowed this secret key to activating Aldnoah, which passed on through his genes (genetic in nature) to Asseylum, but could somehow also pass it on the his military commander, the Orbital Knights, even though they weren't genetically related to him. There seems to be some inconsistency in whether this secret key is genetic, or just some secret code that you chant - and I'm doubtful that the sequel can explain the true nature of Aldnoah's activation criteria.\\n\\n\r\nNext, when Slaine helped Inaho to fight off and defeat an enemy Martian Katapract, why did Inaho have to distrust him so much and even shoot him down at the end of the engagement? Didn't the both of them combine forces to defeat a more powerful opponent, and if they really distrusted each other, how could they possibly have had each other watch their backs just minutes ago to defend the flying-fist attacks? There was absolutely no reason why Inaho should distrust Slaine when they literally just saved each other from attacks.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, we need to really take a good look at the resolution and see if it makes any sense at all. While on one hand, the mission was a success, many of their lives were lost, both Terran and Martian forces, and the anime literally ends with Kaizuka Yuki doing some insufficient exposition. And though I expected a cliffhanger, this ending was neither exciting, suspenseful, nor complete in any logical way. Although I would say that the resolution of the final operation was unexpected, it didn't drive the plot anywhere -it just seemed like a pointless ending, really, or maybe that's the feeling we are supposed to get from this pointless war? I don't really know.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, where the heck was Yuki and Inko during the entire last shoot-out? If the whole thing shut down, shouldn't they have quickly run back to the control room to get Asseylum out of there? Or at least check on her? I mean, at the end we know that Yuki definitely was still alive, since she was the one doing the narrating, so there's no reason for her not to be in resolution whatsoever...\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art for this anime was really good. The characters were drawn nicely, as were the various Kataphrakts. All actions scenes were superbly well animated, with stunning visuals and CGI effects. The animation of Aldnoah power sequences and various weaponry was also captivating.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe OP theme was solid, as were the two  exciting ED themes that seemed to interchange across the episodes. Also, background music excell ed at both the touching and action scenes, making for a great audio experience overall.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nEither this confusing set or characters is really good for you, or really bad for you. Sometimes it gets really difficult to keep up with all the character personalities, because there are just so many of them. We start first by looking at our main cast.\\n\\n\r\nInaho, a guy with pretty much no emotion whatsoever. He doesn't ever cry in this anime, neither does he actually smile. But he's a thinking soldier and he outwits the enemy in almost every way, granted he doesn't know everything, but he's learning from every battle much quicker than a normal guy would. He manages to defeat 4 Aldnoah vehicles with far inferior Kataphracts. How? He's just that good in his planning and spotting of enemy weaknesses. Other than that, he doesn't have much depth to his character - I don't know where he's from, what he's like outside of battle and he just seems to be a mono-faceted, character with very little growth whatsoever. Even at the end, though we can see his feelings for Princess Asseylum, this added zero to the actual anime. (+1 for being interestingly smart).\\n\\n\r\nNext, we have Princess Asseylum, the semi-useless princess who is naive, very useless in battle, in fact so useless that she herself, as a character, laments her own uselessness and keeps blaming herself to be a cause of all the calamity that's happening to earth (even though she's a martian). Her only positive points are that she is able to stand up and speak for herself, she has quite a bit of bravery and guts, and that she's-quite- pretty. Otherwise though, she's just a tool being used by both the Terran and Martians, a tool for war. Again, she has little depth, but shows more growth than Inaho, because she realizes that she needs to do more than just talk to be useful, she needs to fight. (+1 for being brave, +1 for slight growth)\\n\\n\r\nNext, we have the very interesting Slaine Troyard. This character is like a pendulum, he swings from sanity to insanity, from evil and good, and he does all of this semi-reversibly. He starts off by killing his partner after his partner loses a battle, then goes on to make an escape to help the princess. In the process, he assists the defeat of another Orbital Knight, gets tortured by his boss, and at the end shoots Saazbaum who killed his boss, then shoots Inaho who was already pretty much half-dead. I have no idea whether Slaine is a good guy or a bad guy. He isn't even both - he can't be. He has killed people for no reason, switched from being a martian-sided then terran-sided then back and forth again. In fact, his only loyalty is to Princess Asseylum, but even then he doesn't seem to be helping the princess in any plausible way throughout the anime except for teaching her about birds, the sea and the sky of earth. Slaine is definitely multi-faceted, but as of yet, we have no clue to his backstory whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have a whole set of varied supporting characters, who are actually quite interesting in their own right. We have the adult couple - Lt. Marito and Cpt. Magbaredge, whose fates are intertwined with the loss of Humeray, and who secretly love each other although Magbaredge stated she hated Marito, when she actually said she found Marito of \"particular interest\" earlier in the anime. We have the bromance between Lt. Marito, Yagarai, whom we see spend time together very often in the anime. We have Inko, the obligatory character who has a crush on main protagonist Inaho. We have the very confusing Rayet, who is basically just a crazy girl who can't control her emotions properly, and ends up trying to kill the princess and then trying to kill herself, and then succeeding in neither. All of these characters lack a lot of depth and breadth, and there is nothing much I can do to empathize with them, since there honestly isn't much to empathize with. Only Lt. Marito has ANY semblance of a back story, and even then, it's basically just his medical condition and doesn't say much about his actual training/roots.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the antagonists, they all seemed very linear. All the antagonists seem to have the same idea \"We must take earth from the Terrans! Just because we want to, actually.\" So we could essentially refer to all of them as the same person and it would still make sense. The antagonists also, we don't understand much about because there are no scenes told from their perspective. While they were interesting while they lasted, they seemed very interchangeable and not at all unique in their own way.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter interactions were good though, and there were some situations that made me laugh - how Inko can't hide her crush on Inaho, Calm's change of heart after seeing a pretty Martian (Princess Asseylum), Yuki's constant nagging/teasing/taking care of her brother, Inaho. However, this anime really lacks character depth and growth in almost all the characters.\\n\\n\r\nI would like to point out that all the female characters in this anime has managed to break free from the \"rescue the damsel in distress\" stereotype, and instead, they are all shown to be able to help out the war in one way or another, without being too much a burden. (+1)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nDefinitely enjoyed this anime, thanks to all the explosions, interesting tactical strategies and very well animated actions scenes. Some scenes that were meant to be touching though, didn't really get me emotional because the characters just seemed so disposable and replaceable that I wasn't able to empathize with them in their situation. I also loved how they were able to strike a good balance between the lengthy dialogue scenes and the quick actions scenes. It didn't feel too long or too short.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:  6.75/10",

            "content": "This review has spoilers, read at your own risk.\r\nLike most people, I decided to watch Aldnoah.Zero since the Urobutcher was attached to it. After the exposition-filled first episode I made the decision that I would turn my brain off and just try to enjoy the action that followed, hoping that things would be entertaining but coherent. Sadly, this anime couldn't even manage that.\r\nThere are two protagonists in the series; Inaho and Slaine. Inaho is an unemotional character who never develops in any way except for perhaps the very last scene of this season, which leads nowhere. He is supposed to be intelligent, but the realityis that every other character in both the Vers and Terran armies are stupid. Hence, Inaho is really just a big fish in a pond full of idiots. Slaine, on the other hand, is defined by one characteristic; he is loyal to the Princess. Other than this loyalty, there's nothing else is revealed about him and most of the time he's clueless.\\n\\n\r\nThe side characters have the same issue of having no depth or development. Examples of this are Markito, Rayet and Princess Asseylum. Like Slaine, they're defined by one characteristic or trait. The characters in the Vers Empire are cartoonishly evil and lack any intelligence in their decision making. They constantly repeat how they are superior to the Terrans while relying purely on their technology to win fights which end up having clear weaknesses. They also enjoy mass murder. Hence it is impossible to take the Vers Empire seriously.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot behind Aldnoah.Zero has potential but it is constantly harmed by the poor decision making of its characters. While the most discussed example of this is the final scene of this season, another good example comes in episode seven. After Slaine had helped the Terrans defeat a Martian Kataphract, Inaho shoots down Slaine's plane and the Terrans forget about him. Inaho isn't questioned about what he did, the Terrans don't wonder who Slaine is and none of the Vers Empire wonder why he would be shot down. At the very least Inaho could have captured Slaine, but instead he makes the worst decision possible and shoots Slaine down for no reason. Scenes like this happen too frequently for Aldnoah.Zero to be enjoyable, even when trying not to think while viewing the series.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a real shame too because Aldnoah.Zero is better than most anime in its technical aspects. The soundtrack by Yuki Kajiura and Hiroyuki Sawano does its job, especially during the battle sequences with songs like Breathless. The upbeat tempo helps make the battles seem fun and enjoyable. One weakness to the soundtrack that should be noted is the lack of variety. As for the visuals, the CGI is a bit clunky at times, but the high production values are displayed during most of the mech fights. If only the effort put in to animating these battles were put in to the rest of the show.\\n\\n\r\nBefore concluding this review I must discuss why I decided not to pick up the second season of Aldnoah.Zero. The last episode of the first season highlighted how weak the writing is for the show (or that they were going for shock value to increase sales and hype). The final scene begins with Slaine doing literally the only thing he could possibly do to get his beloved Princess killed, aiding Saazbaum to kill the Princess. This then unsurprisingly leads to Saazbaum shooting the Princess and Slaine getting upset. Slaine then shoots Saazbaum, and then for no reason shoots Inaho as well. While this scene is full of stupidity, it is followed up by the first episode of the second season bringing everyone back to life, retconning everything that just happened. Therefore, after realising that nothing that happened on screen mattered since everything can be reversed at any moment, I decided to give up on season two and I wouldn't recommend anyone to pick it up.\\n\\n\r\nAs for season one, I also recommend to give this a miss. While the mecha battles are nice, there isn't much else going for Aldnoah.Zero. There are far better mecha anime out there to choose from.",

Aldnoah.Zero is very mediocre, yet also intriguing and kept me captivated during my binge marathon tenure. \r\nThe Story is one that we have all heard and read before. Colonial wars, mechas, and a love triangle and a friendzoned archvillain who as of late is probably the most hated character in anime. I give the Scifi storyline an 8 it is very well written and the plot devices are linked interchangeably in a manner that is effervescent storytelling equal to RidleyScott's Blade Runner.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art is very mediocre, the mark of a masterful animator is making the 10-12 fps that anime is usually run on, make it seamless, and fluid. Needless to say our animator isn't that skilled.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST for Aldnoah.Zero is absolutely orgasmic, my ears glistened with glee every time I heard the soundtrack. Quentin Tarantino once said, the greatest thing a director could ever achieve in cinematic brilliance, is pairing a cinematic scene with the right ambiance and soundtrack. Aldnoah.Zero scored very highly on this.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters are very bland, yet multifaceted. The raw emotions are there, but isn't thoroughly expressed due to the poor script writing and animation. The second season will be much better I'm sure.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed this, I rated it a 8, but it is more of a 7.\\n\r\nI'll probably forget about Slaine in a month, but man that dude is probably the Terran equivalent to Hitler and Osama Bin Laden.",

After finishing it, only 1 word comes to mind: DULL! The story feels like a copycat from basic Mecha anime, totally unoriginal with no gripping plot nor any memorable characters! The story simply lacks weight, coming across very empty, very meh! It\u2019s frustrating because you feel the tension in the 1st episode where humans are attacked and completely unmatchedto the Martians but it quickly loses steam and the investment into the story fades away! The reason for the attack on earth is simply childish, no proper justification is given and what makes it worst is that the anime wants you to feel sympathetic for the Martians! The lame ass way this arc is dealt with just makes you want to laugh at how bad this is since you don\u2019t care! The 1st Martian robot to fall was cleverly dealt with but when they repeat the same formula for all opponents, it just becomes plain boring! Plus, seeing these new and improved robots destroyed by the old ones made no sense. And to top it off, the Martians were defeated by a high school kid who\u2019s the MC! It\u2019s like the rest of the military forgot how to be tactical! If the MC had some secret military background, then it would make some sense but nope, nothing like that! Also, why don\u2019t these advanced Martians change their battle tactics after the 1st defeat rather than resorting to the bad guy of the week strategy! Hype and some form of fun is brought to us by the composition but then it\u2019s all sucked out by the glorious plot holes in the story!\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, I didn\u2019t care about anyone cause the character development is s*** here! I didn\u2019t know anyone\u2019s personality nor motivation, I don\u2019t even remember their names except for Slain! And Slain has some nice exposition but sadly he\u2019s not spotlighted that much! The MC never leaves an impression which is why he\u2019s so forgettable! He\u2019s literally a walking plank of wood and the only thing I know about him is that he likes eggs! I even thought he might secretly be an android which will be brought up later but nope, he\u2019s just a human! Usually you will find these cold and quiet type of characters on a secondary level character but not here. His lack of emotions and boring dead line delivery meant he\u2019s not that interested. So if he isn\u2019t, then why should I care about him? He has the same expressionless face whether it\u2019s his friend dying or during a battle and that dead pan look freaking pissed me off! And the princess chick has the blessing of plot armour and that\u2019s about it! The rest aren\u2019t even worth mentioning aside from one character that will be stated at the end.\\n\\n\r\nThe Mecha fights are nicely displayed until the 3D effects kick in, then they just become ugly! The predictable end to the fight doesn\u2019t help either. The art is wonderful in some places, though majorly comes across as bland. The best part is the music composition, especially the ED. And the Voice Acting are plain as well, nothing stands out unfortunately.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending is overdramatic and certainly not earned but it plays the tragedy aspects well! And you would think that at least they had the balls to pull off that ending since it greatly peaked my interest for S2 but no! That cop out was horrible! Just imagine how different my review would have been if they had actually gone with it! I feel like the story would have been much better if they had focused more on the global impact on Earth from this war. And if they made that PTSD guy as the MC, it would have made for a more compelling story. Won\u2019t recommend this unless you are a big Mecha fan.",

            "content": "I first started this show because of its impressive set of staff - Aoki Ei (Fate/Zero) as director, Urobuchi Gen (Fate/Zero, Psycho Pass, Mahou Shoujo Madoka)  as creator, Sawano Hiroyuki (Shingeki no Kyojin, Guilty Crown) doing the music, and on top of that Kalafina sining the OP. But I have to say I have mixed feelings after finishing the show. Don't get me wrong, the show is not bad, but it kinda fall short of the very high expectation.\r\nStory - 7/10\r\nThe story is basically about the people in Mars (called \"Martians\") fighting people on Earth. It revolves around the three characters. Inoha, a highschool student in Japan; Slaine, an Earth born living in Mars; and Asseylum, the Martians' princess. The story is not particularly original and is fairly predictable (except, perhaps, the end), with the characters unsurprisingly manage to resolve the events one way or another. The politics is not complicated and don't expect too much of it. What I would like to see more is how the two main characters (Inoha and Slaine) and their strands of the story interact with each other. But perhaps that is left for the second season.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 6/10\\n\\n\r\nAs many people have criticised, this is probably the weakest part of the show. The main guy, Inoha, is extremely calm and base all his decisions on logic. I don't have problem with his character except that I have no idea what he is thinking about. Well, being mysterious is not a problem, but Inoha lacks the charisma to make me care about him as a character. As the show goes along I feel he is just a tool for the story to progress. Slaine is more interesting to watch, but again I would like to see more dimensions to his character apart from the whole \"being loyal to the princess\" thing. As for Asseylum, she is the typical kind hearted princes, nothing particular worth mentioning. \\n\\n\r\nSince a large amount of screen time has been given to the three characters, not much time is given to potentially interesting characters (e.g. Marito) which is a shame.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nVery good background music score. I love the OP. There may be a slight overuse of music during the fighting scene but overall fine. Voice actors have done a decent job.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe mecha design is nothing ground breaking but nice to watch. Characters design fit their characters. The quality of the show is of a good standard. The mecha fighting scenes are ok but I wish they are longer and more detailed, showing more of the movements of the mecha.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI actually do enjoy the show somehow. I hope this season is only for setting the scene and they will go into more depth for the characters and story in season 2. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Aldnoah.Zero is the standout title of 2014, and rather than being because it was overhyped, the appeal comes from something that few titles in recent years have been able to pull off well: the ability to blend \"classic\" ('70s and early '80s) real robot genre storytelling techniques with modern visuals that are slick, beautiful, and satisfying -- even to viewers who may not yet be on-board the CG-in-anime train.\r\nStory: Though it's regrettable how much A.Z relies on information dumps to give exposition and story information, it generally works, with the first episode being probably the worst offender. (If you can handle that much, you canhandle the rest of the series easily!) This is where my analogy to classic real robot storybuilding comes in, and is why I enjoyed A.Z: it reminds me of shows like Mobile Suit Z Gundam and Super Dimension Century Orguss, which don't devote ridiculous time to world building and instead let the plot propel the viewer's knowledge. The viewers know what they *need* to, but there's still plenty of open space, so to speak. \\n\\n\r\nArt: A.Z has wonderful visuals, evident from the beginning. I like the character's designs an immense amount, since they're all unique in some way, and don't fall prey to sameface syndrome. Faces are expressive and movements are elegant and nice to look at. In terms of the mecha, though the designs are a bit weird at first, they really grew on me. I especially came to love the Orbital Knights' mecha, reminding me of Z/ZZ Gundam's Qubeley, with curved lines and other non-traditional design aspects. Generally, the CG used is done so well, with only a few of the early episodes looking a little \"off,\" especially the Kataphrakts. It becomes much more palatable as the show progresses.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I haven't enjoyed an aniost as much as A.Z in years. Their use of insert songs is fantastic, without a doubt, and creates some of the more memorable scenes in the show. The opening and ending themes are also wonderful, and memorable, rather than being generic toss-offs.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Though it's not apparently a widely held opinion, I liked how A.Z used and established its rather large cast. A.Z is propelled by a serious war story, so of course there isn't time to devote to beach party or hot spring episodes. Like world building, characterization is also largely part of the plot, with most of it coming as a result of a plot event (i.e., Inaho's coolness under fire, Asseylum's steely resolve, Rayet's trauma, and so on). That's another classic real robot pullback: developing characters enough to give you a \"sense\" of them, but not laying their entire inner life bare for the viewers' consumption. It's a method that seems sterile to a lot of viewers, but one that I actually enjoy and miss greatly.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: A big reason why I enjoyed this show is that it's fantastic at building suspense. As it begins in a rather brutal way, you're never sure what may happen to the characters, and the tension is real in nearly every episode in this front half. I cared about the characters and their struggles, and it kept me coming back - and wanting more. I also found the robot fights fairly compelling, and though I am a mecha fan, I'm not in it for the robots at all! Overall, I felt like A.Z devoted equal time to all aspects of the show, for a mecha especially, and it was a real pleasure to watch something so well-crafted.",

            "content": "\u201cLet justice be done, though the heaven falls.\u201d\r\nJustice. When we talk about justice, there are just too many definition and perspective. That\u2019s why, it has a looong way to define it perfectly. Justice, is familiar with politics, economy, social, etc. And Aldnoah.Zero takes justice in the form of political problems between Mars and Earth. It\u2019s not a simple problem actually, story about justice in form of politics need a room to develop. So, the main question is, can A-1 Pictures cover all of this hardship in only 12 episodes? Let\u2019s see.\r\nOh yeah, just a little warning, If you came with high expectation such as GeassR3, be prepared to regret. In the contrary, this show has too many plot holes and boring two-dimentional characters. That\u2019s why, I don\u2019t recommend this show with frills like \u201cGeass R3\u201d. They are way too different. Aldnoah is Aldnoah, and Geass is Geass. Okay, let\u2019s begin my review!\\n\\n\r\nVisual - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nIt has awesome visual. That\u2019s it. Frankly said, it feels like Hollywood in the form of anime. Kataphrakt (err, what a difficult name) or the mecha things in this anime blend perfectly with the situations or backgrounds. A-1 brilliantly mix shadow, grain, camera angle, lighting, color, and smoke to make everything looks beautiful. What an amazing job they done here.\\n\\n\r\nThe same thing also applies with the character design. Hair, costume, gesture, face, and body are perfectly match and sync. If every show only assessed on visuals, Aldnoah.Zero will easily become the victor. It\u2019s the best mecha show in terms of visual, I guess. Furthermore, it is a common knowledge that mecha show need an impressive and somewhat futuristic action. This show cover that two aspect nicely.\\n\\n\r\nMusic - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAh, music. I personally think Sawano Hiroyuki has done her homework. Nope, not simply done, she perfectly done her homework. I really love the ending song where she sings the Germany words. Even if I don\u2019t understand what she said, I just love how the music ends the show every weeks. Woah, I hope she sing more of the Germany lyrics. Great job, Hiroyuki-san!\\n\\n\r\nAnd, for the background music, it really is amazing how they complement each other. Visual and music, I mean. In almost all of the battle scene, it is making me amaze because of their awesomeness. They support each other to keep the tension high. And for this, I respect A-1 pictures and their composers, all of them are professional.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 4/10\\n\\n\r\nNow then, let\u2019s discuss how the story flow. Honestly, it is dissapointing. First, I have said that, this show is about justice in the form of politics. Well, 12 episodes just not enough. Most of the problems because it didn\u2019t tell the audience about the political conditions before the war between Mars and Earth. This is the core problem why Aldnoah.Zero doesn\u2019t have a strong stance. If we compare to other political story, this show lacks information to guide the audience. Really, it was disappointing that there are many potential in this series.\\n\\n\r\nSecond, there is no flashback about Inaho\u2019s childhood, which makes all of his characters irrational. Seriously, is there a boy who lead a normal life everyday that tough in a war? Including when his friend and many citizens died. It\u2019s a pain just to see him act that calm in this show. In my opinion, the only character who acts logically is Slaine.\\n\\n\r\nLast but not least, it isn\u2019t really important\u2026. But, it is seriously bugging me. What is it? It is\u2026 Well\u2026 There are too many characters which name I can\u2019t remember. Eddelrittuo, Saazbaum, Keteratesse, Rayregalia, etc. Please give me a break. :\u201d)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 3/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\u2026. one of the worst aspects in this show. As i said before, there is no flashback about Inaho. So, it\u2019s annoying to see him lead his friends into a war. He is a perfect example of what people call two dimentional characters. It\u2019s illogical to act that calm and make a perfect strategy when someone just lost his/her friend. There are things called shock, down, stress, depressed, etc. Especially a highschool boy who leads a normal life everyday.\\n\\n\r\nMoreover, which makes this show seems funny is how Inaho defeat all the opponents easily. We see all the military defeated pathetically, but then, a mere highschool kids come and save the day. Poor you, military force.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, there are some characters who can\u2019t develop properly. Just say Marito. He is one of the most potential character in this show. But, throughout the course of the story, he didn\u2019t do anything useful. Why? Because Inaho come and save the day. It\u2019s just frustating too see him didn\u2019t have the room to develop. Poor you, Lt. Marito.\\n\\n\r\nOne last thing, Inaho isn\u2019t the one who act illogicaly. That\u2019s his friend too, Calm. Phew, I just don\u2019t understand how he thinks. There\u2019s one scene when he said \u201cKill Mars\u2019 people\u201d and \u201cAll of them are enemy\u201d. But, when he meet one of the Mars\u2019 beautiful person, he forget all of his ideals. Man, is your desire to avenge your friend that weak? Poor you, Calm's friend.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe that\u2019s all I could say about this show. One thing to keep in mind, this show will be a great entertainment if we watch this without thinking. The visual will hypnotize your eyes, and the sound will hypnotize your ears. So, do not think! That\u2019s my advice for this show. ;)\\n",

            "content": "What happens when you have Gen Urobuchi, Hiroyuki Sawano, and Kalafina all working in the same project? Pure awesomeness you say? You'd be wrong, but it's not precisely their fault... or yours. If you are thinking of watching this series, think again. This is one of those series that start up great but do not live up to their potential. Be warned, if you are a hardcore fan of mechas you will probably want to pass on this anime. I'm serious; I think I didn't hate it precisely because I'm not a big fan of mechas.\r\nIs this series terrible? Personally, I think it is enjoyable,but really underwhelming considering the people attached to the project. Now I have to mention that Urobuchi only wrote the first 3(!!) episodes, so that explains a lot.\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\r\nI'm not a big fan of mechas so I think I enjoyed the story more than a fan of the genre. Still, from my own experience, this feels like Code Geass and Gundam, (that is, politics, deep characters, complex plots, and betrayals left and right) but doesn't manage to even hold a candle to them. I'm not knowledgeable enough to call it a Gundam ripoff, but it\u2019s a common opinion in the forums. After all, there's not a lot originality here, just your typical sci-fi conflict of people living on earth against those who live in space and, in this case, Mars. There are even some Evangelion vibes here.\\n\r\nIn order to get the full story you are absolutely required to watch the second season, which is not very good. This is because the first season ends with a huge cliffhanger, and if you get this far you will probably be invested enough to continue watching. Think of it as a 2-cour show with a break in between.\\n\r\nIf you know Urobuchi's previous works, you will know what to expect in terms of plot twists regarding characters. Without giving away details, you will find a lot of underwhelming subversions to his writing. I found myself constantly thinking \"Is this really Urobuchi's work? How can this be?\" Well, that was before I knew he only wrote the first 3 episodes. The most likely explanation is that Urobuchi's original idea was changed by the rest of the writing team (I read that he actually left the project), probably hoping there would be more seasons. Now the story it's not bad, I kinda liked it but it certainly doesn't live up to Urobuchi's potential. The science behind the titular Aldnoah, a mysterious source of energy, is never explained or explored in detail!! Other sciency aspects of the show are not explained and only hinted at; the show forgoes spoonfeeding entirely for the sake of better pacing. The problem is that this happens frequently in battles, so expect a lot of asspulls. The first episode starts really slow, a lot of infodump in the first half followed by jaw-dropping action on the second half. The 2nd and 3rd episodes are pretty solid, but after that the plot is not that good. So yeah, this goes to show that the 3-episode rule doesn't always apply.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nThe animation and art are pretty good, this will certainly catch your eye. My only complaint would be the use of CGI for the mechas, they have a decent amount of detail and their movement is good BUT the animation is not that fluid, like when a video game skips frames. Your eyes will become used to it, as it's not as noticeable as it was in knights of sidonia. Still, the battles are very well done. Special mention goes to the fire animation that is used when they cut to a specific character's flashback.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nSound effects get the job done. There are many known seiyuus (eg. Cloud from Advent Children among others) and to me they fit their roles very nicely. The soundtrack, as expected of Sawano, is pretty awesome. If you liked his work on Guilty Crown, Ao no Exorcist or Shingeki no Kyojin, you will definitely like it. Many tracks and motifs will remind you of his previous work, and he again colaborates with artists such as mpi, Mika Kobayashi, and Aimee Blackschleger, it's like a Sawano-verse of music. The only problem is that some tracks are a bit overused, but this is not as much of a problem as it is for the second season. Seriously, I only watched the series because I had listened to the entire OST before and thought the series should be just as awesome. The opening is another gem, a song by Kalafina, a band you might remember from Madoka.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nI didn't really hate any characters (actually that would've made me stop watching as the plot is not that good), but I think I'm a minority in this regard. There are interesting characters but to me the main problem is that few of them show any progression whatsoever. Basically, only the main characters are developed and supporting characters are just there to worry about the main ones, sans one or two exceptions. There is one character that mildly annoyed me because at least half of her lines consisted of repeating the same question to mock another character. While I initially like that Inaho, the main character, is always cool-headed and fights with intelligence and strategies rather than with the power of nakama or similar clich\u00e9s, he later becomes more similar to Kirito from SAO (speaking only in terms of intelligence/knowledge and natural abilities). This quickly hurts the suspense of the series. Another problem is that Inaho almost never shows emotions. I mean it, you will show more emotions when something happens to him. Speaking of emotions, most other normal characters react way too calmly to shocking events. It is a little refreshing in that you're not hearing \"KISAMAAA\" every five minutes, but this being a series about war makes it feel a little too unrealistic, and almost everyone is able to keep their problems to themselves. One of the main characters showed promise but was forcefully derailed because the writers couldn't create a better villain. There are hints of romantic subplots but almost all the focus is on the overarching plot for the sake of pacing; don\u2019t waste your time shipping characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThe battles are pretty good, but as the series goes on the suspense will diminish. They start to feel like a mandatory fight-of-the-week and this doesn't get better on the second season. The sciency stuff that I mentioned earlier doesn't help much in this regard. Just turn your brain off whenever there's a battle and you will enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nWhile this show was enjoyable for me, it didn't really deliver, and the second season is worse. If you get tricked into watching it for any reason (like I was) you'll feel compelled to watch the second season and trust me, IT IS worse, you will know it from the moment the cliffhanger at the end of season 1 gets resolved. The series conclusion, while feeling final and hopefully with no hope of continuation, is rushed and really, really underwhelming, and a character that was introduced two episodes before basically changes the entire ending. The final battle is pointless, forced and could\u2019ve been better. Just so you know, I gave the 2nd season a 6/10 but I'm not writing a review for it, I'm hoping this review can stop people before they are invested. Just to give you some perspective I should mention that I marathoned this series right after the second season finished airing; I would have hated the ending (and the show) had I been watching weekly.\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr Decent-to-Good series overall, a lot of wasted potential in terms of writing and characters, awesome music, and probably a waste of time if you are a fan of mechas. This goes to show that name-dropping doesn't necessarily make a show good.",

            "content": "I have very conflicted feelings about the quality of Aldnoah.Zero. By TV anime standards, it was fairly impressive considering the flops we've had lately (i.e. meganebu and magical boy anime).\r\nVisually, I personally would call it fantastic. The art style was unique and I don't ever recall seeing frames that I could post on social media and mock. The battle scenes were interesting and well animated. I loved the aesthetic of the entire series and while some people felt the CG robots were too out of place, I thought they added something unique to it. Visual appeal is a big factor for me when watching anime,so this definitely influenced my very gratuitous overall score. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was also pretty great. Mika Kobayashi's upbeat music made battle scenes all the more enjoyable. Like I said, aesthetically this anime scored much higher than most anime I've seen and this is coming from someone who absolutely refuses to watch a badly animated series. \\n\\n\r\nNow that I've covered pretty much all of the pros..there are a lot of cons. The story was practically non-existent. The plot was basically two teenage boys destroying the universe over a martian princess which...actually makes it sound better than it is. I just recently finished both seasons of Aldnoah.Zero and if I was asked to write an essay on the story line I would not be able to. It was boring, confusing (as in almost nothing was explained), and much too heterosexual, to put it into simple terms. The season 2 storyline was even worse.\\n\\n\r\nAnother con of Aldnoah.Zero was the characters. Slaine was the only character who made the anime worth the watch for me (which was ruined by season 2). The whole \"sweet with a tortured past\" trope always manages to grab me. But that's where my enjoyment of the characters ended. Inaho was probably the most boring main character I have ever seen. He had absolutely no personality and no character development and his only redeeming quality (for me) was his skill in battle. There aren't really any other characters I can mention here because they were all so similar personality wise.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR I would definitely watch Aldnoah again if only for the visual appeal. The plot was lackluster and practically non-existent and a 6th grader could probably write better characters. If you are a fan of sci-fi and/or mecha anime and interesting battle scenes, I think A/Z would be worth a try, but don't look forward to an extremely intricate plot.",

No spoilers.\r\nI wanted to like this series because...mecha (yes I know its a bad reason) but you would have to be higher than Alice in Wonderland to understand how this series works.\r\nPros\r\n1. The battles. The conflicts between the two forces are hands down the best part of this series. Watching the rivalry grow between two worthy opponents was the saving grace for this show. Also as a side note making gun noises might increase your viewing pleasure.\r\nCons\r\n1. The leads are overpowered. Can't really go into this without a spoiler but it generally kills the conflict. With veryfew exceptions the viewer knows who will win, it is more about how.\\n\r\n2. The characters suck and get little to no development. Inaho is like what happens if Heero Yuy screwed a robot and had a kid. If he ever triggers his emotional side it is going to explode and become a unicorn. Slaine is an idiot that has no logical part of his brain. Supporting characters- Not one standout from the crowd and very few get any development. If you can tell me three things about the characters that doesn't involve the military or war, I'll give you naming rights to my unborn children (please don't pull a pokemon and name him douche).\\n\r\n3. The storyline made as much sense as the stairs by Escher. No idea where it was supposed to go, was manipulated heavily by the creators for certain things to be possible, and I didn't like where it ended. However the first season finale was actually good so I watched the second season.\\n\r\n4. Romance. The writers have most likely never been in love/a relationship/had a meaningful conversation with the opposite gender. It is bad and they should feel bad.\\n\\n\r\nResult: Watch if you want to see mech battles. Do not watch if you need a compelling storyline, romance, good character development, or full proof logic.",

            "content": "Having had watched and kept up with the anime since the beginning; I enjoyed my brief time spent in the fandom. I was absorbed in it as a series, but it was more for its idea than anything else, and my own interest in the themes shown throughout it. However, the dark  atmosphere mixed with mecha/sci-fi that I love above all other genres was, in part, what had me overlooking quite a few flaws. I'll go into detail, but before I begin, I'll just note that this is one of the first series I've ever been conflicted enough about to write a full reviewfor. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe concept overall was unique and quite interesting-- a species almost mirrored in looks to humans, yet drastically different in nature. When I read about what this anime's main focus would be, I found myself very interested to see it. The themes presented throughout the anime, and also the likelyhood of the viewer to side with the humans instead of the Martians through the simple observation of all the character's experiences was what stood out to me. At times, there was a few scenes where the viewer had to conclude their own findings and try to understand for themselves what just happened, this helps the viewer get pulled into the story. Even though this anime was thematically powerful, emotionally evoking and thought provoking, Aldnoah.Zero has a weakness, and that would be the writing behind the anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe main reason I'm giving the story a 7/10 is because it's mediocre at best. There are many questions left unanswered due to the sudden, disorganized and very rushed ending; however, I will talk about the ending further later in the review.\\n\\n\r\nIf asked to explain the plot of Aldnoah,Zero, how would I? A handful of Humans go to Mars, they discover a special force called Aldnoah, they turn into \"superior beings\" and are later called Martians. A war breaks out between Martians and Humans. There's a fake assassination thrown in there, then even more war breaks out. All ending with a real assassination. There's seriously a lack of natural flow from each of these events. It feels like each conflict is pulled out of nowhere and not thoughtfully put together to help develop the story or the characters. There is no driving force to propel the story forward, it's just one event after another - put together to make it exciting enough for people to keep watching it without knowing or understand exactly what they're seeing on the screen. It also doesn't help that many of the characters were overall very bland and unimportant.\\n\\n\r\nOnto the topic of character development itself, there is little to none. There is no big event that changed any characters for the better or worst because the only big event that happened in this anime was in the last 5 minutes of the entire series. There was changes in characters from event to event but there was no overall character development. No one grew from these events-- their attitudes or their overall judgement. Through simple, skillful development and writing skills, there could have been amazing character development. We could have seen how Inaho feels about his comrades, instead we're left with this empty shell of a main character, that's almost too calm to be natural; Maybe we could've understood why Slaine was so attached to the Martians besides the lame one or two sentence explanations that don't really fit.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the ending of Aldnoah.Zero. The ending to this anime was what made me realize the amount of poor writing I'd been overlooking previously. In short, Inaho finally makes an emotional decision, and instead of using common sense he goes against Slaines order to stay away from the princess (who was just shot  by Sazzbaum). Inaho instead started crawling towards the princess. When Slaine continued to say stay away from her, Inaho ignored him, instead turned over and pulled his gun on Slaine. That part of the scene ends with a gunshot and we're left not knowing whether Inaho is alive or dead but we're lead to believe the latter. This ending just overall felt very rushed and unpolished. We're left asking more questions than necessary. It's one of the most terrible endings I've seen in awhile. Only added to the unanswered questions and unresolved conflicts left throughout the latter half of the story-- each of these only added to how terrible the ended really was. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to more positive things, the art was actually something that I enjoyed. It was a bit clunky at times but they used various techniques to make the mechas blend into the background; such as camera angles, colors, smoke, lighting, etc. It was overall very visually appealing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThis category can be a tad foggy, the characters in and of themselves are not bad. However, they are poorly developed. Their base characters are interesting and are a bit realistic. Each of them is unique and designed around their own personal role and personality. If there was more character development throughout the anime I would have given a higher score.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nAs I have said earlier, I did overlook quite a few flaws throughout the story. Perhaps if the anime had been longer (the first season in and of itself), it may have redeemed itself by answering a few more questions and resolving a few plot conflicts. It came to a close too suddenly to be enjoyable. This series was easier to enjoy closer to the beginning rather than the end of it, which is odd enough to say. However, the overall concept and idea of the anime is keeping me from rating it below a 7.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nAldnoah.Zero can be considered an example of what could have been amazing. If perhaps there had been more time or guidance it could have risen higher, and had a better chance to shine with such an interesting idea. However, due to the characters being hardly developed, their plot in general was left with holes towards the end, and the events left in disconnect; I feel lost. I probably wouldn't recommend someone to watch this.",

            "content": "Aldnoah Zero is a futuristic war anime that does a fairly good job of avoiding many of the pitfalls that mecha anime tend to tumble into on a regular basis. In an alternate history, astronauts discover an advanced power left behind by an ancient civilization on the moon. This power allows them to separate themselves from society on Earth and partially terraform Mars, which they make their home. It's not long before war breaks out between the Earth and Mars. 15 years prior to the start of the series, the moon is literally shattered during combat, and somehow the two sides settle into an uneasypeace. \\n\\n\r\nThe war is renewed when a visiting Martian princess is attacked by terrorists during a visit to Earth. The forces of Mars descend onto Earth in force. Here's where the series does a great job of not letting the mecha get too far out of whack. The Martians do have some nifty powers in their mechs, but never do they become unexplainably powerful, or lacking any sort of weakness. The earth forces use much less extravagant mechs that are easier to relate to as potentially recognizable military hardware so the conflict isn't entirely alien in nature. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters, the way the war is setup does allow for a semi-feasible insertion of the stereotypical Japanese high school student cast, war tensions and universal conscription. I did enjoy the way the male lead ends up turning down better equipment as the series moves on, choosing a beat up trainer mech painted neon orange as his ride throughout. It makes the scenario a little more desperate and human. \\n\\n\r\nThat said...I don't really like the cast of characters, particularly on the Earth side. Nothing really changes for them. They are constantly on the run and trying to avoid death at every turn. Most of the character development is experienced through the anti-hero(?) a Earthling boy that ends up living among the Martians. From his view you see the inner workings of the Martian society, and it's where the series gets it's somewhat dark, cynical aura from. That said, the series avoids painting either side as innate good or evil, a trap that has easily doomed many a war anime to first level mediocrity. The Earthling hero suffers from a borderline case of \u201cToo badass to relate to\u201d but constantly being outgunned somewhat compensates for this. I would have liked it a lot more if the series showed us a crack in his shell. I liked his calm, matter-of-fact nature, but after awhile I want to know he's still human. As for everyone else, you can take them or leave them. The princess is dragged around by circumstance. So are the rest. I was going to rate this series significantly lower than I ended up doing mainly because of the ending so far. I'm not going to spoil it, but I think it's worth seeing though to the end. \\n\\n\r\nI was worried about the CGI for the mechs initially, but I ended up not noticing it too much in the end. Music also just okay. Worth a watch, and here's hoping they don't screw up what they started with the second set.",

            "content": "If Akame ga Kill had no plot armor, Aldnoah.Zero would have plot armor as solid as platinum. If Attack on Titan was the king of trolling, Aldnoah.Zero would be the undisputed Overlord. If Madoka Magica bullied Sayaka enough, Aldnoah.Zero relishes in the Slaine pain. Yeah, Aldnoah.Zero is quite the show.\r\nStory (4/10):\r\nAldnoah.Zero has a premise easily comparable to Gundam or Code Geass. But for new military mecha fans who haven\u2019t seen either of the two, A/Z was something that interested me and was easily accessible. While the first three episodes was rather straightforward and filled with face-palm inducing info-dumping, it at least set up the showrather well and I was quite hooked.\\n\\n\r\nThen the show went on downward spiral with \u201cGiant Enemy Robot of the Week Approaches!\u201d episodes with little to no progression. The fights lacked any sort of tension since it was almost always Inaho who had any sort of logic to beating these robots and you were pretty much conditioned to know he will always win. Speaking of Inaho doing all the work, my suspense of disbelief was constantly broken by foolish, useless soldiers just standing there to fulfill the weekly quota of edgy death count.\\n\\n\r\nA/Z slowly gets back on track once Inaho makes one of the most laughable decisions i\u2019ve ever seen to Bad Luck Slaine, but you know\u2026 plot armor. The story progresses at a brisk pace towards a climax that I was very much anticipating. And just when I thought A/Z could get back on track, it pulled the greatest troll ending of all time. Personally, I thought this was a lazy decision to get you to watch season 2, because even with all those ambiguity, with a plot armor this stiff you can easily smell BS.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (3/10):\\n\r\nInaho is deus ex machina personified. He\u2019s pretty much there to carry the show and not much else. He\u2019s emotionless and stoic and and that\u2019s not necessarily bad. What\u2019s bad is that we don\u2019t know what's going on in that head of his, like how is he so smart or why is everyone else so dumb? One could argue that he is the sense of logic in the show and that emotions will get the better of him, but even then I would have appreciated a bit of internal monologue to even justify this.\\n\\n\r\nSlaine has a personality at least. However, the show hates Slaine so much it\u2019s almost hilarious. It was almost like watching an episode of Spongebob to see how much the writers can pour as much unjustified torture to Squidward just because he wanted some peace and quiet. In A/Z case, it was Slaine trying to get back to the beloved Princess Asseylum. Slaine is basically a overly sympathetic character with decisions so inconsistent and hard to follow topped with a coating of teen angst. Man, poor kid.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the rest of the cast, there are some decent characters. The main villain Count Saazbaum is the only antagonist with actual motives and a backstory that establishes his reason to fight and Marito is the only one in the team with a compelling back-story and decent development. Unfortunately both are glossed over by the rest of the bland cast. Princess Asseylum is that one person who wants to promote peace\u2026 said every naive Princess character imaginable. She also has a bunch of revive potions stacked with so don\u2019t ever worry about her. Rayet wants revenge for the death of her parent and vows revenge\u2026 said every angsty anime teen ever *cough* Eren Jaegar *cough*. Everyone else is forgettable and that\u2019s a shame.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation (3/5):\\n\r\nYes, the CGI is awkwardly integrated and jarring. The show tried to cover it up a tad bit with fog covering it. You could overlook it if you\u2019re not picky, but most of the time it sticks out like a sore thumb. The action scenes with the mechs were still enjoyable nonetheless. But even if the CGI was decent or if it was 2d animated, the mecha designs just seemed so bland and generic especially for the Terrans. \\n\r\nAs for the 2d animation, it was pretty well done. I like the character designs as they were pleasing to look at and as for the scenery, very impressive. It has great detail even if it was filled with CGI mechs flying around it.\\n\\n\r\nSound (4/5):\\n\r\nThe opening \u201cHeavenly Blue\u201d is a great hype opening. From the intense beginning to a more mellow vibe, I feel this opening embodies A/Z pretty well along with some great vocals from Kalafina. It sounded a bit similar to Fate Zero OP 2, but given that both are great openings, I can\u2019t really complain. I don\u2019t care about the first ending, its was pretty forgettable for me. That\u2019s why when \u201cAliez\u201d came as the second ending I was happy. Everyone remembers that one scene from the first episode when \u201cAliez\u201d came on and it perfectly fits the intensity. And by itself, it's a great listen and probably my favorite ending of 2014 for the strong vocals paired with top tier Hiroyuki Sawano hype tunes.\\n\\n\r\nHiroyuki Sawano continues his quest to make epic OST\u2019s for mediocre shows and Aldnoah.Zero is no exception. The various tracks just hype you up with the winning formula of a great orchestra and well complimented vocals. However, like most Sawano titles, A/Z is guilty to overusing its tracks which can get a bit tiresome even in a great OST like this. As for voice acting, everyone does a great job from the monotone voice Inaho to the well represented conflicted emotions of Slaine.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nAldnoah.Zero is heavily flawed, there\u2019s no denying that. But i\u2019d be lying if I said I didn\u2019t have a good time so this show pretty much works as a time waster. The shock factors are pretty cheap, but they\u2019ll keep you awake at least. I don\u2019t regret watching A/Z even with that troll ending and oh wait\u2026 season 2. Oh well, on its own season 1 of Aldnoah.Zero earns a 5/10 (Average).\\n\\n\r\nPS: Feel free to comment on my review. I'm always up for advice so I can improve my reviewing skills.

            "content": "Summer mecha releases were mediocre and Aldnoah is not an exception. Argevolen was hardly average and Aldnoah is slightly above average and that's only because of the art and music used which were very good. Specifically..\r\nStory 5: Nothing new here, the most used story usually used in mecha anime, a fight between Terrans (earth) and Martians (Mars). It turns to be an one-side war since Martians acquired some high tech technology called Aldnoah, which only they are able to use. Then, as usually, a Terran rises and confronts all the martian mechas, mainly having as weapon his I.Q (debatable...).\r\nArt 6.5: Art is decent, though Imust admit Martian mechas really look ugly. I know they wanted to give an impression of a most technological advanced civilization, but they did it all wrong. It's like we see 2 diferent anime in terms of mechas, completely different style.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8: Music and sound effects simply put, are by far the best aspect of this anime. Aketagawa has done a great job, the music is not exaggerating but epic at the same time, sound effects of weapons -shields- clip shells are very realistic.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter7: MC-Inaho: I must admit he is interesting; he is a low profile guy, doesn't talk much and he is quite smart, as far the others are concerned, there's nothing special... Character development is non-existent with 1 slight exception of Slaine, where we get to know his family's past (his father specifically).\\n\\n\r\nSumming up, Aldnoah.Zero gets  a 6 ...on the very edge. So hyped at the beginning... By the way, I understand its popularity, but don't get baited, it's a DECENT anime but nothing too much (most overrated anime of its season). Try Broken Blade... you will be amazed.",

            "content": "Prior Knowledge: N/A\r\nAmong the sea of LN and Manga adaptations, Aldnoah.Zero stands out trying to show that original ideas can make a difference. It's renowned staff and high production value gives this show, at least in appearance, a run for its money. Hoping to make its mark in the community like other original anime screenplays before it. Most famously Neon Genesis Evangelion in the 90s, Code Geass and Eden of the East in the 00's, and most recently Kill la Kill last year. Needless to say, many viewers were anticipating this show with high expectations given its staff and premise, me included. Expecting this showwould drive the anime industry out of its current stagnant state. It's realistic take on war and the military setting it apart from many of the other action and mecha anime and it being a prime focus of the show's overall atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 6/10\\n\\n\r\nSet in an alternate reality where relations are tense between Earth and a monarchy race on Mars, the Vers Empire. The plot doesn't waste any time throwing viewers right into the conflict. After an assassination on the Vers princess, the people of Vers declare war on Earth. The story focuses on a group of characters who find out the princess survives the assassination and attempts to inform Vers she is safe to stop the war.\\n\\n\r\nBefore going on, if you were expecting all out over the top dynamic mecha action with missiles and lasers and drills that will pierce the heavens, then you won't find it here. Aldnoah.Zero presents war in all its realistic glory. Soldiers die. Tactics and strategies are used. And military command is highlighted. Simply put, its realism is a refreshing feel from the usual direction mecha and action anime shows take and is clearly a core component of the plot and world building. Though that's not to say over the top is bad either, of course.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the first episode effectively shows the devastation and power of the Vers Empire and what the war means for Earth, this is soon shoved to the sidelines as the plot takes a tunnel vision view into the main characters. The story itself soon settles into an odd RPG style pattern. To describe it as best as I can, it feels like you're seeing a party travel to their quest point while killing bosses and monsters along the way. \\n\\n\r\nThere isn't any indication of what happens in other parts of the world and the worldwide communications jamming seems like a lazy way to force the viewers to focus on only the characters prevented before us. The show somehow made an interplanetary war feel claustrophobic. The grand scale of the war shown in the first episode is ignored entirely and makes it seem the entire war occurs wherever our group went, like the entire war revolved around them.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nDespite its haphazard plot movement, its art definitely shows the show's high production value. The first episode alone does give an explosive (get it?) presentation of their animation quality. While some viewers may gripe about the CG, I thought the CG for the mechs were animated well and made them more machine like in its aesthetic and serve as good contrast to the natural backgrounds. Scenery and backgrounds are drawn to mimic realism and do a good job of keeping the show as grounded as possible. At least, as grounded as a show with flying mechs and Martians would permit. The show does well to contrast between the colours used between the Terrans and Martians. With scenes on Earth using predominantly cooler colours (blue, white, yellow) and Martians using more striking colours (shades of red and black). This is apparent very much during the first half of the show, where scenes would switch between the battles out at sea and the Landing Castle control quarters.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED sequences are a joy to look at. Beautifully animated and bright colours. I especially like the snow globe scene with Slaine and Inaho which shows they are two sides of the same coin representing the same ideals.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAldnoah.Zero's soundtrack is definitely unique. The electronic beats and synth sounds may be an odd choice at first but somehow works when played alongside certain scenes. It's a different approach to a traditional orchestral score that accompanies shows like this and it's a good change. Voice acting is done well if a little uninspired and sound effects are spot on. I have similarly high praises for the OP and EDs of the show. I like how the show interchanges between the two EDs using whichever one was more appropriate to end the episode on. All in all there are no complaints here.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 4/10\\n\\n\r\nEarlier on I praised the show on its overall realistic take on war and the military; the atmosphere in general. My enthusiasm was however short lived by the main characters. One critical point in maintaining the essence of realism is character behaviour and development. Characters should react and respond to a situation appropriately. And it is here where I feel the show lacks, ruining the immersion of the fairly realistic world presented to us. \\n\\n\r\nGetting the obvious out of the way, I did not like Inaho's character. His stoic and overly analytical personality did not fit within the tone the show was trying to create. In any other show, the overly analytical and cool character would have a certain air that exaggerated their superiority and intelligence. Characters such as Sora from NGNL, Tatsuya from Mahouka, and Kiryuuin Satsuki from KLK have similar properties and in the context of their respective shows do fit as a personality type. However, a show with a realistic tone like Aldnoah.Zero such a character would be a stretch to accept and hard to sympathise with. A teenager in war conjuring plans that succeed where trained adult soldiers somehow cannot use the basics of battlefield tactics such as flanking an enemy or cover fire is extremely unbelievable. Having the Captain agree to his plans and ignoring his sister's orders, a ranked superior, also further degrades the use of military rank and authority. But hey, that doesn't matter because his plans work anyway!\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters are unfortunately 2-dimensional. Or rather, their characters do not develop. With so many side characters and sub plots from Lt. Marito's PTSD to Rayet's personal vengeance, it's hard for the show to cover it all up in 12 episodes. Even if there is a 2nd season, the execution of the subplots is highly imbalanced. There is more screentime of Lt. Marito's PTSD than side character development. Inaho's friends are pushed to the side once they get on board the ship, reduced to background crew that hardly get any exposure. The princess is treated as a walking generator.\\n\\n\r\nSlaine's character was the one that appealed to me the most. His questionable decisions at the last episode showed that not everything is clear cut and also showed Slaine's confusion on where his alligence lies. A character that reacted appropriately by the events that happened to him, by acting inappropriately. Had the show further elaborated on his turmoil in earlier episodes, it would have made the final one even better.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, the show could have used some major improvement on character development. Inaho's character simply feels out of place as he solo's Vers super mechs. Other characters don't get any sort of attention that I wonder why they are there at all. Slaine could have greatly benefited from some more character development. Many characters are too static and feels like they are just there for the sake of it. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 6/10\\n\\n\r\nI truly enjoyed the first 3 episodes. I really did. The scale of a war between Earth and Mars, a mech show that feels like a futuristic army instead of over the top battles, and the conspiracy of the Vers Empire. The show however, quickly fell from its high point and I felt like the show became stagnant. While I did enjoy the battle sequences, it felt the battles were there just for the sake of it. A filler as our crew make their way from point A to B. The characters were unconvincing and broke the realism brought at the beginning of the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe last episode was without a doubt a shocker and the last thing anyone would have expected. There was a bit of everything in there, from Inaho's thoughts about war, to action and conflict, and a finale that's sure to make people go crazy. I'm disappointed that the entire show did not match the finale's quality in terms of content and storytelling. Despite how good it was however, one good episode does not redeem a show's worth of mediocrity.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 6/10\\n\\n\r\nI won't say this show is 'average'. Because objectively, it's not. It passes the mark, albeit barely. The plot is easy enough to follow and battles make sense. Visually, the show is great to look at and the soundtrack is pretty cool. But for a show trying to create a sense of realism, its characters let it down a lot in this regard and is an aspect I cannot emphasize enough if trying to mimic that sort of atmosphere. Even if the last episode was very good, the buildup to it was messy and disappointing. While it was an impactful one, I felt that it was the sole purpose of it. The finale would definitely make viewers forgive the wonky storytelling, if they had any complaints in the first place. Hopefully we'll see more of the same quality of the last episode in the next season.\\n\\n\r\nI welcome any feedback you may have. Visit my blog for a more detailed review.",

            "content": "I will be spoiling major twists from the series, so if you want to be completely left about the show and watch it for yourself (which I don't recommend anyways). I won't recommend you to watch this show anyways, but if you are currently watching this show or plan to watch it, it is probably best if you do not read this review. You have been warned.\r\nExpectations are a big part of whether one enjoys a show or not, especially when talking about upcoming anime. When you see big names like Gen Urobuchi, Hiroyuki Sawano, and Ei Aoki, you can't help but get excited forwhat you assume is going to be something with quality, in both a storytelling and production aspect. That said, when the credits for episode 1 of Aldnoah.Zero rolled down my computer monitor, my expectations grew more and more. Little did I know, however, that the roller coaster that is Aldnoah.Zero is one that goes down and down until it reaches the pit of hell.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing that I normally like with Urobuchi's works is how he sets up the world the characters reside in. With both Psycho-Pass and Fate/Zero, everything felt so grandiose in scale, with so much detail going into the general setting of the story. And this is how Aldnoah.Zero sets itself up in the first couple episodes. We see Martians blowing up international cities all across the globe, everybody evacuating the city with terror and panic in their eyes. But then everything shrinks to the size of an earthworm. For the next number of episodes, all we really see is our main Terran characters on a ship to Russia for a long time. Other than some shots of Mars that we see occasionally, we get no info on how the war is going, almost like the ship is the world itself. \\n\\n\r\nNow, the abysmal setting of the show also provides pacing issues. Apart from a couple of fights here and there, nothing really happens during the majority of the series, even though there is a fucking war happening. It lacks any semblance of tension because of this, and the viewer is just left setting here waiting for someone to attack. This problem, however, would be more or less out the window if we had interesting, fleshed out characters with emotion and growing development as the series progressed. And for the most part, it doesn't, or it at least doesn't feel important in the slightest. But before we talk about the characters, I still have a couple more things to say about the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe asspulls are strong with this one. This is the problem that really gets to me when thinking about this series. This is another contributing factor to why there is a lack of tension in this series. A lot of these \"big twists\" are mainly shoehorned in by the writers to get a fake shock out of the viewers. Here is the big spoiler I was talking about. In the first episode, Seylum gets \"assassinated\" by \"Terrans\". Initially, I was really shocked and saddened, because I quite liked Asseylum in the beginning, and her plea to have Humans and Martians live in harmony.  But then, all that emotion I put into that shocking death scene was all gone by episode three (or four, can't really remember) when she is revealed to actually be alive, and the person who died was actually a stunt double. Shit like this just pisses me off. You can't just randomly bring back people with little to no explanation and pretend like it never happened. The cast of characters is so large, yet almost no-one who has any significance to the plot actually dies. Instead, the only people that actually die are either the enemies, or people who we really could not care less about because we haven't spent any time with them. \\n\\n\r\nThis could be confusing to some people though, because in the grand scheme of things, I didn't give a damn about ANY of the characters. Because of the aforementioned ridiculously large cast, character development is very hard to come by here. Hell, most characters don't get anything other than one specific character trope that we have seen a million times over. The monotone killing machine, a princess with a heart of gold, someone with PTSD as their only defining characteristic, and even a one-dimensional loli to please those who are into that sort of thing. \\n\\n\r\nLets get onto talking about our main protagonist, Inaho. There really isn't much to this guy. Just because he has basic military training doesn't mean he should be instantly ten times better at fighting than people in the military (which, by the way, the military is so useless in this anime, which can be considered a flaw in and of itself). He actually has no personality, no relatability, nothing. He doesn't even change his facial expression once during the entire series. And yes, you could make the argument that seeing someone who can actually get shit done rather than whining all the time is great, and for the most part, I would agree with you, but we are given no backstory to Inaho as to why he would be so cold and calculating in the first place, no fleshing out of his character. He is the way he is because it's important to the progression of the plot, and nothing more. \\n\\n\r\nWe also have Slaine, the son of a Terran who did research on the power the martians have known as Aldnoah. At first, I sympathized with Slaine and his plight. He was constantly abused by Martians because of his race, and watched the only one who actually gave a damn about him die in brutal fashion, OR SO HE THOUGHT! And when he sees that the Princess is actually alive, he wants nothing but to see her again and keep her safe like she did a number of years ago. The thing is, by the end of the series he pulls an entire 180 degree switch in character for no apparent reason at all. He actually ends up siding with the guy who is trying to kill the princess, which MAKES ABSOLUTELY NO GODAMN SENSE. I don't even think he realizes that that's what the actual goal of the main villian of the series was, even though he stated it on mutiple occasions. Slaine is the biggest reason why the ending of the show is so dreadfully bad in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally, we have Euphemia vi Britannia... oh wait...\\n\\n\r\nSeriously though, Seylum feels like a failed clone of Euphemia from Code Geass. The princess who wants peace between two opposing sides. Like I said before, I initially liked Seylum in the first episode. From her dialogue, you could feel her desire to see the world that she has not yet witnessed, what with it's bright blue skies and flying birds, etc. The reason I could not care about her at all is that after her \"dying\" and coming back to life, she really loses her impact. She is still the best out of the three main characters, mainly from her pleasant demeanor, but is still wasted potential, much like the rest of this show is. \\n\\n\r\nWhen initially gearing myself up to watching the show, there was one thing that I was skeptical about. The animation. I, as with quite a few people, are not a big fan of CGI in anime. It just looks jarring and out of place, especially when the rest of the show is in traditional hand-drawn animation. And although the CGI mechs looked worse than they would if they were hand-drawn, it doesn't look as bad as it could've been. That being said, the mechs did not flow well, and the fights were lacking in the choreography department. I will applaud the people who actually did the designs of the mech as they were pretty unique (in a good way). As for the hand-drawn animation, it's as to be expected, nothing too spectacular but nice to look at. \\n\\n\r\nComposed by the masterful Hiroyuki Sawano, the soundtrack was something that did bring the viewing experience up slightly. However, even though I haven't any anime composed by Sawano other than Titan, I can say that, compared to that, the soundtrack had nowhere near as much impact as it did with Titan (for me at least). This might be due to the fact that the anime as a whole didn't leave an impact for me, but I don't think that if I listened to the soundtrack by itself that I would be thumping my foot to the beat as I find my self doing regularly with great soundtracks. \\n\\n\r\nI didn't really like the opening theme too much. It seemed to me like the tone and beat of the song kept switching randomly, and it felt kind of awkward. I like the chorus of the song though. The ending left a bit more of a positive impression on me because it has a little bit of 8-bit put in there. I am a big fan of 8-bit, and even though there isn't much in that song, it does warm my heart to a degree to hear it, so major props in that respect.\\n\\n\r\nAldnoah. Zero, to me, served as the perfect way to show that attaching big names who have been a part of very good anime in the past does not necessarily mean that the anime in question will be any good. This is because, to put it lightly, Aldnoah.Zero is the epitome of wasted potential. There isn't much I can think of to really give anyone a recommendation to watch this. But, many people in the community have watched it and have found something to like about it, and that is fine, but I personally cannot in good conscience recommend something that does not live up to my standards. There are much better shows with the same basic premise as this to watch, trust me.\\n\\n\r\nThanks to you all who listened to my ramblings on this show. If think my points are interesting enough to warrant a discussion, I would be happy to discuss the anime with you. My reviews tend to be way too long, so I'm glad people actually take the time to read the whole thing. I guess I have a lot of ideas to talk about, not to toot my own horn or anything. Thank you all for reading this wall of text, it truly means a lot.",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)\r\nMecha-anime, a staple of the medium. No other form of media does it quite like anime when it comes to giant robots squaring off against one another for the sake of justice and survival. Aldnoah.Zero may seem like another typical robot show, but with its interesting characters, nice visuals, and killer soundtrack, it is a cut above the rest.\r\nSTORY\r\nOur story begins with two conflicting sides, the Terrans (those of Earth) and the Vers (those of Mars). 15 years after Heaven's Fall, and after a particularly catastrophic event, these two sides begin to war with one another once again.\r\nAldnoah.Zeroprides itself on mech-battles. There is no shortage of fight scenes that occur throughout the show. It becomes apparent early on that this is its main focus. Usually, the show consists of our team fighting one Martian Kataphrakt (the term used for the enemy robots) for a few episodes, moving to a new location, fighting another robot, and so on and so forth. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, since many of the battles are interesting to watch. Part of the fun is seeing how Inaho, Yuki, and the rest go about taking down these leviathans of destruction using only their wimpy little machines (comparatively).\\n\\n\r\nThe show also takes its time building its world. We learn who he Martians are, what they fight for, and how they are able to use the mysterious power known as \"Aldnoah.\" They create an interesting dynamic between the Terrans and the Vers that doesn't seem too far-fetched. I always enjoy societal conflicts, and I felt that AZ did this nicely enough.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the main problems with AZ is its lack of focus, or rather too much focus in one particular area, namely the battles. While the battles are great fun to watch, there is really no goal to be had for the show. As I said previously, much of what goes on is circumstantial. Everything is taken care of at the moment, with only the general locations of the squad changing per episode (as well as the new robot to fight). Perhaps I am expecting too much from the show, but I would have liked to have seen a grander narrative than what was presented.\\n\\n\r\nAs a final note, the ending is very good even if it ends on a big cliffhanger. Season two should hopefully pick up nicely where they have been supposedly left off.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nAldnoah.Zero is definitely a good looking show. In terms of the art style, much of the coloring presents us with a somber attitude. A lot of the colors are dull or lackluster but serve the purpose of making us feel that the characters predicament is real and foreboding. Furthermore, because the battles are so prevalent, the backdrops and general scenery for the battles varies quite well and is always pretty to look at. From inner-city buildings to a sunset-overlooked island, the locales that are visited were always beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nThe actual animation for the show was good. Personally speaking, I am not a big fan of CG within anime. However, I felt that the animation during the fights was nicely choreographed, easy to follow, and overall pleasing to the eye. Many of the Martian Kataphrakts were imposing and intimidating, and gave off a nice feel of \"Oh yeah, you are the bad guy for sure.\"\\n\\n\r\nAs for the character designs, I found them to be fine. I especially loved Princess Asseylum's look in her princess outfit and found Slaine's design to be both good and mysterious (given context clues throughout the show).\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nWhereas AZ focuses a lot on the battles, the downtime between them is mainly spent on character and character growth for the most part.\\n\\n\r\nI found some of the characters within AZ to be quite good. The best among them is Slaine. Slaine experiences many tumultuous emotions throughout the series. Beginning as a Terran working with the Princess, he is a foreigner in a place where he is not wanted. What he goes through can be described as no less than suffering and it becomes wholly apparent by the end that he has fully changed as a person after the events he witnesses.\\n\\n\r\nSaazbaum is also a well written character. While insane, he has clear goals and purpose for doing the things he does. It isn't just because he is evil; he has a sense of honor and pride that allows him to make such heinous acts. While what he does is fundamentally insane/evil, it is hard to argue that is character's background was flat.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, Asseylum and Rayet get a nod, simply because they start off on opposite sides. The former wants peace and harmony but learns that war is not such a simple thing. The latter wants nothing but agony for the Terrans but comes to understand that there is a time and a place for compassion.\\n\\n\r\nAll this being said, the rest of the characters are either under-developed or severely lacking development. While Inaho is a bad-ass, his emotionless persona and general neutral demeanor does not make him a standout character. Furthermore, his sister and friends are all there to pretty much provide minimal assistance in order to let Inaho do most of the work.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest letdown this season was Marito. He has an interesting background that his somewhat explored but not utilized fully, at least this season. I expect great things from him, but as it stands, his character was not given the justice it deserves.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and the ED for AZ are very good. The OP instills this sense of hope, but the female's singing gives us this aura of mysteriousness that permeates much of the show. The ED is one of the better ones I have heard in a long time. It's powerful, uplifting, and strong.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the soundtrack, simply put, is amazing. Hiroyuki Sawano of Attack on Titan and Kill la Kill fame does it once again, giving us amazing orchestral pieces that are incredibly pleasing to listen to and expertly crafted. I cannot give higher praises to this man's work.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is also well done by each cast member. There were no absolute stand-out performances, but each VA did a nice job in their respective departments.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nIn a show about giant robots, AZ does a nice job of presenting us with likable (and hate-able) characters mixed with good battle scenes that fixate your attention to what is happening on the screen. Even though I said that Inaho is not a good character, it is still fun to watch the OP dude do the impossible in order to protect the planet and its people.\\n\\n\r\nMuch of my enjoyment with the show was mainly due in part to Asseylum and Slaine, and wanting to see where they would end up next. I like romance a lot, and I want my couples to end up happily-ever-after if at all possible. And that is what kept me coming back for more. I wanted to know what was going to happen to these all of the characters, how they were going to overcome their next battle, and what new technology the enemy would throw at them next time.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some episodes that leave you wanting to watch the next episode; you just have to know what comes next. And the final episode is no different. While I am sad that I must wait three months or so for the continuation of AZ, if it will be as good as season one was, I don't mind the wait.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fine, mech-battle heavy and interesting world but not much else\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Good, beautiful scenes and fights with too much CG for my liking\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Fine, a mix of strong and weak characters give us an interesting cast\\n\\n\r\nSound: Great, superb in every department\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good, robots, love, and misery\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 7/10",

            "content": "*MINOR SPOILERS FOR ALDNOAH.ZERO*\r\nAlright! It's time to watch some Turn A Gunda- WHAT THE FUCK?!\r\nYeah, the premise is about humans that colonized Mars that decide to take over Earth with Earth people not having that crap so it turns into war. So, Gen Urobuchi made the premise and had a hand in episodes 1-3 and 9-10. I can safely say that this wasn't nearly as good as his other works like Fate/Zero and Psycho Pass, and this is probably the worst show he had an active role in. Well, that aside, this was a pretty polarizing mech show back in 2014 for a few reasons.The questions at debate here are: \"Was it as bad as our main lead?\" and \"How much worse is this compared to other shows the Urobutcher worked on?\" Well, let's find out, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nLike I said, this premise isn't unique. This planet Mars is home to people called VERS, and they had a poor history with current Earth, and Princess Asseylum tried to patch that up, only for an assassination attempt to occur and cause big time war between VERS and Earth. It was first used in Turn A Gundam, but that isn't even the major issue given that it is still a bit different overall. Sure, it still sounds cool on paper, but it had some seams in the fabric, and over the course of the show, those seams ripped apart into giant holes, and for a more recent example, this goes in a similar direction to what Kabaneri would go in. Sure, Inaho figuring out mech weaknesses via science is cool the first few times, but then they get a bit more farfetched, and when Slaine (a VERS) decides to help him, he stabs him in the back (figuratively) and leaves him for dead in episode 7, which not only was the final nail in the coding for Inaho's character, but the moment the show jumped the shark. The whodunnit thing with the assassination isn't done well, and when the villain reveals himself, his motives clash heavily with his methods. There are definitely some plotholes and badly reasoned character decisions towards the latter half in particular, but easily the biggest slap in the face has to be the ending, which opts to shoot Asseylum and Inaho in the face to play the whole \"protagonists are dead\" card for a terrible cliffhanger when they are shoe for absolutely no reason. The second half was overall pretty terrible, but thus ending was the worst of it\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nMeet Inaho, your average mostly silent protagonist with a nigh-nonexistent personality and an ability to be the only competent person here, to the point that he may have came out from an 80's or 90's video game. He is that lame and the fact that he (for no good reason) backstabs Slaine, who was helping him, ruined any chance of him being a passable character. Next up, we have Bad Luck Slain. A character who just wants to do the right thing as fish the princess, but gets screwed over by EVERYBODY! Asseylum herself survived the assassination attempt via body double and somehow disguised herself (it's never explained) and while very attractive, isn't that compelling. Most others are just meh. Nothing special. Now for the villains. Count ASSBUM (Saazbun) I already mentioned, but the other villains, are about as shallow and there to be evil as say, a Captain Planet villain. There really isn't much of anything of note here, aside from that one guy with a potentially interesting backstory and fleshing out if they gave him more time to leave much of an impact.\\n\\n\r\nART: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nConsidering A-1 pictures, their staff slaved over some well done character models and animation, as well as impressive artwork. Then, there's the subject of debate: the CGI mechs. They look kinda clunky and noticeable. However, the fight scenes are still pretty entertaining regardless, using the CGI to decent effect there, for how bad it looks and blends. The action scenes are pretty much what makes this show somewhat memorable, and not a total waste. Plus, some of the mech designs are pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is rather nice. The vocal tracks, while overused, are still pretty good. It's a pretty nice OST, even if it's only really memorable for how much they shove it into your head :p . The OP is pretty nice, and it was done by Kalafina, who previously did Fate/Zero OP 2, and while not as god as that, is still a rather nice OP. The normal ED is ok. For ED 2 aka Aliez, it is awesome. Especially the kickass chorus and finale, which oddly enough, has the most emotion of the series despite not being that emotional. It's a really badass track. The dub, is pretty nice. Our mains are pretty good, and the villains are done well too. There is some star power though, like Brice Papenbrook as one of Inaho's friends, or Patrick Seitz as Vlad. Like I said, the dub is pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nI found the first half rather entertaining, despite the characters. Then the second half revealed all of the show's major flaws, and became pretty upsetting, especially that BS finale and episodes 9 and 10. The mech fights were still entertaining regardless, even if some of the outcomes weren't very good, and the music was still a treat, but man did I grow to dislike the second half, starting with the infuriating way episode 7 ended. Seriously, that marked the death of my enjoyment with this series as well as the death of whatever quality it had left.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 5/10    RAW SCORE: 52/100\\n\\n\r\nThis could've been rather good, but is squandered its chances to deliver us something flawed and a bit generic. It was entertaining in the first half, though not  necessarily great, by the second half really dropped the ball, especially the finale. It's not great or even that good, which is a shame given the kickass premise. If you have some time to kill, and wanna watch a mech show with that time, then maybe consider this if you REALLY have nothing else, but eh, Maybe look somewhere else first. With all that said, I bid you adieu.\\n\\n\r\n*EDWARD!! JACOB!! Oh wait, INAHO!! SLAINE!!*",

            "content": "Note: this review may be subjected to revision.\r\nAh Aldnoah Zero where do I even begin with you. \r\nA summer 2014 mecha anime directed by El Aoki (of Fate Zero and Ga Rei Zero fame) and animated by A1 Pictures and Troyca. It was one of my most anticipated series on the roster alongside Shinchiro Watanabe\u2019s well directed thriller, Zankyou no Terror. I remember my heart pumping with excitement as I watched the trailer to this anime with Sawano Hiroyuki\u2019s epic score booming from my laptop screen and Gen Urobuchi being himself again. There was destruction, there was fear and there was conflict. It looked tobe a cross between Gundam (the original one) and Legend of the Galactic Heroes and my inner nerd burst out of me with anticipation.\\n\\n\r\nOnly what I received wasn\u2019t quite what I had expected. \\n\\n\r\n**Story**\\n\r\nThe plot is relatively simple and straightforward to understand. The story begins with the Vers Empire, a Martian race, plotting to invade Earth. They then order for the assassination of the princess as an excuse to carry out their diabolical plans. As Landing Castles (in other words colonies) start dropping on to earth the invasion begins and mankind is soon fighting for survival. Meanwhile, a trainee known as Inaho discovers a sickly girl who apprehends him beneath an underpass. That girl turns out to be the real princess and she tags along with the humans to ensure that her demands for peace and the survival of the human race are to be met. \\n\\n\r\nI have no qualms about the story of Aldnoah Zero. It has a ton of potential also, depicting a War of the Worlds type invasion where Earth is being driven to the brink of extinction by alien forces. The first half is set up as a monster of the week style scenario where human forces try to hold their ground and defeat a Martian and his/her overpowered mecha.  Conflict plays a major role here and the anime shows that gleefully.\\n\\n\r\nHowever it falls short soon enough. The human characters don\u2019t seem to have any complaints about being in war and none of them experience any sort of trauma apart from a few. Martians seem to attack humans just for the sake of it and when their motivations for invading the planet have been revealed it just becomes laughably stupid. The biggest problem with this kind of anime is that it is meant to also be character driven. But apart from Slaine and Marito, none of the characters seem to compliment the narrative; instead they hold it back due to their overall poor characterization. Being set during an invasion the anime also seems to shy away from showing the consequences of it, instead deciding to focus on anime antics during some of the breather scenes. \\n\\n\r\nExposition was handled terribly. Characters sometimes just stand there talking, sometimes describing things that were just not important to the overall plot. In fact in the very first episode, the anime begins with the princess talking to us about the earth\u2019s oceans and lands and how essential they are to the overall race all while just standing there speaking to Slaine. It was a clear example of a failed attempt at the device known as \u201cshow don\u2019t tell.\u201d \\n\r\nMy biggest gripe however is with the ending. Wow what a way to end your first season Aldnoah. Basically to put it short they\u2019ve prevented any chance of a second season occurring without an asspull happening. And indeed a second season is coming out. Prepare yourselves for an asspull guys, its coming. \\n\\n\r\nOn the surface the story isn\u2019t that bad but as it continues the flaws become apparent. The plot an pacing are okay but the execution is lousy. \\n\\n\r\n**Characters**\\n\r\nFirst off you\u2019ll notice the show has some very bland characters that are mainly stereotypes of other archetypes. You have the generic overprotective sister, a typical high school girl who wouldn\u2019t look out of place in taking over Shirley from Code Geass or Hare from Guilty Crown\u2019s spot (she\u2019s also a generic tsundere) and your everyday dumb best friend who just serves as comic relief and to only enter the action when the plot demands for him to do so. And alongside that you have some 1-dimensional villains that, if you\u2019re a fan of mecha anime, you would have witnessed multiple times now in other shows of the same genre. \\n\r\nAlso the princess\u2019s assistant is a bloody loli. A LOLI!!! This isn\u2019t Sunrise for crying out loud. Having that character sprout \u201cHime-sama\u201d just ruins the overall mood of the narrative. War isn\u2019t meant to be funny and why is her assistant a little girl? Shouldn\u2019t it be an older representative of the Vers royalty?\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem though is the characterization of the main character Inaho. Usually main leads in mecha anime can be characterized along the lines of being determined and somewhat na\u00efve at the start. Inaho is skilled in mecha combat but instead of being desperate to save his world from a Martian invasion, he doesn\u2019t give two shits about it. In fact he doesn\u2019t care about anything or anyone for that matter. Sure he takes action like any reasonable person would but he has the same facial expression on his face the whole time. He has no personality whatsoever and because of this it\u2019s difficult for me to even root for him. It\u2019s like watching a literal robot acting as the hero of a tale of betrayal, greed and death. It doesn\u2019t fit the series and is ridiculous even by Urobuchi shows standards (who tend to have dark brooding semi-emotionless heroes).  \\n\\n\r\n**Animation**\\n\r\nA1 Pictures is known for having good animation especially if they\u2019re funded by Aniplex. Sure they failed hard with Fairy Tail and due to popular belief, Magi but shows such as Sword Art Online, Blue Exorcist and Shin Sekai Yori have been well handled. With Aldnoah Zero being such a big property helmed by the likes of El Aoki and Gen Urobuchi, you\u2019d expect this to have near Fate Zero levels of astounding visuals. Plus they teamed up with Troyca too. \\n\\n\r\nBut nope, they even messed up the animation.\\n\\n\r\nThe show itself has some great set pieces and the strongholds of the Vers Empire look gorgeous. The explosions in particular look nice and visually impressive but everything else looks rather standard for mecha fare and nothing special at all. The human animations feel clunky at times and there is even some slight off model sequences going on at certain intervals. The biggest offenders are the mechas for they are completely done using poorly rendered CGI. This leads to battles looking slightly unpleasant and sometimes very jerky with its movements, an example which can be closely analyzed easily in episode 2.  It is not well integrated with the 2D animation the series offers us making it seem jarring when the 2 are mixed together. Oh and did I mention that the CGI looks like it was pulled out of a cutscene from a Japanese PS2 game. \\n\\n\r\n**Sound**\\n\r\nFinally something this anime manages to get right. The sound here is exceptionally well crafted by composer Sawano Hiroyuki who was responsible for such works as Guilty Crown and Attack on Titan. The preview proves this as it is littered with not only your typical Sawano tracks that you\u2019ve heard on multiple occasions but also some ear pleasing sounds that reflect the brutality and hopelessness of war itself. The opening by Kalafina also deserves merit for being the best Kalafina song I\u2019ve heard since the second opening of Fate Zero. The ending by Mika Kobayashi comes in two flavors; a relaxing and almost melancholic tune that accompanies the end of all episodes with the exception of one and a remix of one of soundtracks with more lyrics added that sounds much darker and more serious in tone that is only used at the end of one episode. \\n\r\nThe only problem I have with the sound is that the anime reuses a majority of the tracks especially for fight scenes. Other than that the sound in this anime is well deserving of a high score. \\n\\n\r\n**Overall thoughts**\\n\r\nI honestly wanted to like this. I absolutely adored Urobuchi\u2019s previous works due to their dark themes, his knack for great storytelling and the amount of effort put to the table in contrast to many other anime out there. El Aoki, the director, helmed one of my most beloved series of all time, Fate Zero and having his name plastered on the front poster should have been enough to say that quality was guaranteed. But the more episodes I watch of Aldnoah the more problems become clear to my very eyes. And some of these issues are glaringly obvious and threatening to the lifespan and credibility of the series as a whole. \\n\\n\r\nMaybe I was suffering too much from hype backlash after having my hopes ruthlessly dashed? After all being a Urobuchi series, I was expecting a ton of death, despair and his usual mannerisms. But I\u2019m guessing his departure after its first three episodes kind of made me understand why my expectations were rarely ever met. \\n\\n\r\nAldnoah is below average to me. There were points of elevation but most of the times I just felt bored while watching it. The characters were rarely interesting, the plot was not that well executed aside from its pacing and premise and some character decisions were questionable to say the least. I\u2019m stuck between giving this a score of a 4 or a 5 but well I have to be honest with myself. I didn\u2019t really enjoy this series that much anyways.  \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s also hard to recommend as well. Other anime have done better in its respective genres. Want a good mecha anime, watch Gundam, Code Geass, Eureka 7 etc. Want a great Urobuchi series, watch Fate Zero. \\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll wait for the second season. After all being an anime original it always ignites some suspense into me as I await further plot lines to be concluded and revelations to be shown. \\n",

            "content": "Aldnoah.Zero was a good show.\r\nThat's it though. Good.\r\nGo on any discussion for the Summer 2014 season on the internet, and the most prominent show would be Aldnoah.Zero. I mean, I was part of that hype train too. The God himself Urobuchi and the Goddesses Kaijura/Kalafina with the directing talents of once of the most prominent faces in the modern anime world, (Aoki) and you'd have the hype train to hell that was this show.  The question is, why was A/Z not literally the greatest show of all time? \r\nOur setting and story is quite standard, although that is not necessarily a negative. Reading theMAL description is solid enough to cover that. It's a classic battle between the weak and the strong, the inferior, and the superior. The show plays this well during its course. You feel as if there is a real war occurring, even if it may seem a bit baseless. It really gives off a Code Geass vibe, taking influence from a show such as that is definitely a strong point for A/Z. The show attempts to combine the aspects of multiple back stories for the characters, as well as the war, into one cohesive plot. This works for the most part, as some of the back stories for the characters are quite well done. (Lt. Marito.) However, this aspect stops here, because while the story regarding the war is solid, the aspect based on the other half of the plot, is well... \\n\\n\r\nAnd this is where the show really fell flat in one important area for me: the characters. It is simply astounding how lacking these characters are in this show.  The show cycles through a mid-sized cast, although it mainly centers around Kaizuka Inaho, who is...I don't know, to be honest. Who is this guy? One look at his bio on MAL tells me that he is a high school student who \u201chas a peculiar interest in eggs.\u201d There is a problem if that was literally the most interesting aspect of him in the description. I hate to break any air of professionalism that I may have kept up so far, but this character is so damned bland. I literally wouldn't be surprised if I opened up my latest edition of Merriam-Webster to find his name under the definition of the word itself. He had little back story to speak of, and almost no development in the show whatsoever. Now, it is perfectly fine for a character to be fully developed from the get go, but they have to hint at how they developed, or be slightly interesting in the first place. Inaho fails on all levels. The main character from Rail Wars (Whatever his name is) has more depth than him.\\n\\n\r\nThe show attempts to have another character mirror Inaho on the opposing side, Slaine Troyard. While slightly more bearable and interesting than his male lead counterpart, he still has nothing of importance to speak over. A fighter on the superior side of Vers, he has an undying loyalty towards the Princess of Vers, Asseylum, and that is honestly his only notable point. Speaking of the princess, the show does a good job of making you care for her. Every time she finds trouble, I always sympathized. However, once again, this is all to her. Notice a trend here? All of the characters in Aldnoah.Zero are one-dimensional. In depth analysis of any actions are useless, because they simply do not exist. Each character exists for one specific role in the show, and nothing more. That is just not good writing. The characters needed to be strong for this show to be strong- the story solid, but not good enough to hold the show to a high quality, and the characters failed as a pillar.\\n\\n\r\nNot all is lost, however.\\n\\n\r\nWhat A/Z does extremely well, and I mean extremely well, is the sound and visual department. These aspects of the show do more than enhance the show, they genuinely add to the show itself. Starting from the top, the OP is phenomenal. I mean, everything is done well here, as the song provides the backdrop for each episode- it thrusts the viewer into each episode. It is very well done, as the visuals for the OP add on to the already phenomenal job done by Kaijura and Kalafina. Kaijura also works magic into the show itself. Battles feel epic and important, even if it was just the product of the lacking story. The BG adds an atmosphere, and does it damned well. Pair this up with the visuals now: while not of the highest  quality in recent years, certainly do fall under the category of high quality. Backgrounds are vibrant and well done, and still shots do well of portraying emotion. The show does suffer from wonky  faces and animation from time to time, however, which unfortunately, has become a sort of a standard. The voice talent for the show mainly consists of a mix between very modern seiyuu who will undoubtedly become popular in the next few years, and already established seiyuu. There is a lot of talent here, and while not a show-saver, the acting is clearly done well.\\n\\n\r\nSo in the end, A/Z rounds out to be a show with a decent story, low quality characters a strong soundtrack/visual aspect. I really did want to enjoy this show more, but I just could not. A/Z has failed on many levels, and simply does not deserve a large amount of praise. The ending was actually quite entertaining, the last episode being of high quality. Unfortunately, the show's weak points certainly marred it, and it did allude to a second season or movie heavily. (I mean it's already announced for January.) Considering all of this, is the show bad? Not at all. 7/10, according to MAL, is good.\\n\\n\r\nThat's it though... Good.\\n\\n\r\nHave fun.",

            "content": "Aldnoah.Zero Review (Redo) \r\n\tI\u2019ve decided to re-write my review for this show, as I feel I did not effectively convey my feelings for this show, nor elaborate enough upon the characters and goings on within it. As such, I\u2019m putting more thought into this new review. It\u2019s quite longer and to my opinion a little disjointed, but overall I\u2019m more or less satisfied. \r\nWhen the credits rolled on the twelfth episode of Aldnoah.Zero, quite a few thoughts went through my mind. Principle among them was why I made the decision to watch the series in one go, I felt like I had essentially wasted fourhours of my day, this is not a good show. I consider it to just be bad, plain and simple, though the finale, which I will get to later, is a standout because it outdoes itself and winds up being terrible.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Aldnoah.Zero, such as it is, tells of an invasion of Earth from the Mars-based Vers Empire, a technologically superior offshoot of Humanity that stemmed from astronauts finding advanced technology on the Moon during the Apollo missions of the 1970's. The technology was left over from an advanced alien civilization that had since vanished and somehow a group of people got a hold of it, traveled to Mars, and founded the empire. The Vers Empire is a monarchy with the usual aristocratic titles, with various nobles, or knights, living away from Mars in giant orbital stations above the Earth. These Knights have been in orbit for the past fifteen years since the first Martian incursion on Earth, the oft-mentioned Heaven\u2019s Fall, and are non-too pleased to be there. [Spoilers] Thus, a faction of these Knights hatch a scheme to assassinate  Princess Asseylum, granddaughter of the leading regent of the Vers Empire, and who is embarking on a mission of peace to Earth, using her death as an excuse to invade the Earth and take it for themselves. [End Spoilers] Humanity of course isn\u2019t going to take this invasion laying down, the United Earth Government does its best to combat the Martian forces, but to no avail. The Knight\u2019s Kataphracts, giant, technologically superior mech units are way beyond the capabilities of Earth\u2019s own mechs and other military forces and lay waste to anyone in their path. Anyone, that is, who is not Inaho Kaizuka or nearly any of the named cast of characters that accompany him through the show, as things generally go in a series like this. However, it is with the character of Inaho that my criticisms of this show begin. \\n\\n\r\nThere are three main characters in Aldnoah.Zero: \\n\\n\r\n-\tInaho Kaizuka, the leader of the group of high school kids that get swept up in the war and the walking stereotype of teenaged-mech pilots these days. He\u2019s emotionless, distant and a genius on the battlefield, managing to either defeat or hold his own against the various Knights that show up over the course of the show, out-strategizing veteran military commanders and kicking ass. In a training mech, no less. Now, this is a tried and true character-type that is quite common in Anime as of late and while I\u2019m not overly critical of that as a whole, when it comes to Inaho I\u2019m not so forgiving. The show never explains why he\u2019s this good or seemingly emotionally empty, he just is, despite having a loving sister and a tight circle of friends. I would that some slack, but with my overall opinions of this show being generally negative (which I\u2019ll get to shortly), it\u2019s just something else that piles on. \\n\\n\r\n-\tPrincess Asseylum, granddaughter of the current regent of the Vers Empire, who survived the assassination attempt against her by actually being there. A double was in her place, ala another certain princess in the Star Wars universe, and spends the most of the next several episodes disguised as a human along with her maid, Eddelrittuo. She is kind-hearted and surprisingly well-developed, who feels immense guilt for coming to Earth and, in her mind, causing the war in the first place. She becomes increasingly important to the surviving group later in the show, which I can\u2019t get into as that gets too deep into spoiler territory. \\n\\n\r\n-\tThe third main character is Slaine Troyard, a Terran (as the inhabitants of Earth are called) who found his way on Mars several years ago and is now in some position in the Vers military (I think) under the watchful eye of a Knight named Count Cruhteo, who strikes Slaine with his cane for any infraction or break in protocol, no matter how slight. Terrans are viewed with disgust by Vers and Slaine is treated rather poorly by everyone he comes in contact with, all except the Princess Asseylum, whom it is strongly hinted he has feelings for. Slaine has proved to be a controversial character, dividing fans by his actions in the finale, which I will be sure to cover, spoilers and all at the end of this review. I for one am on the anti-Slaine side and the news that he is to be the main character of the second season starting in January is quite disappointing for me to hear. \\n\\n\r\nNow, one of my main criticisms of Aldnoah.Zero is in the Vers Empire itself, I just don\u2019t buy the plausibility of its existence in the form it is in the show. The empire was formed in the 1970\u2019s, as I said before, and by the time of the events in this season it has been in existence for a scant forty some-ought years, yet it is treated as if it has been around for much longer. I\u2019m not on board with the idea that a presumably large group of human colonists travelled to Mars from 1970\u2019s Earth and willingly subjugated themselves to an aristocratic and iron-fisted system of government, nor do I accept the deep-rooted anti-Terran prejudice that seems prevalent in the empire. The Vers see humanity as an inferior species, with many characters referring to them as mere \u201cinsects\u201d repeatedly throughout the course of the show. Now, I know that people are capable of hating each other over stupid reasons, history is a testament to that fact, but for the citizens of Vers to view humanity with such prejudice I think requires a skip in logic. Again, the empire has only been in existence for forty years\u2026that\u2019s two, three generations at best. I cannot believe that all these Knights and the regular citizens of Mars hold such Nazi-like views of the inhabitants of Earth, whenever they are descendants of them and who all have grandparents and for some probably even parents that are Earth colonists. It just seems nonsensical to me.  \\n\\n\r\nAnother criticism I have for the show is that the human characters just aren\u2019t all that developed, nor share that much in the way of screen time. The three exceptions to this are Inaho, his former instructor Lieutenant Koichir\u014d Marito, a man who survived the Heaven\u2019s Fall event fifteen years ago and is suffering from PTSD and Captain Darzana Magbaredge, commander of the assault ship that the cast of human characters spend the majority of the show within. Everyone else is just there seemingly to remind the audience that other people besides Inaho exist on the Earth and that he went to high school at some point. They are quite under-developed and quite frankly \\n\r\nlargely useless to the overall plot. \\n\\n\r\nMy last criticism before delving into the positives for a little while is the \\n\r\nmain story itself, but with this I\u2019m not especially critical. With few exceptions, I found the goings on to be rather boring, sure most of the fights were neat and machinations and reasoning behind the assassination conspiracy turned out to be interesting, but everything else was pretty boring. Inaho Kaizuka pretty much dominated the storyline and I found him so boring and unlikable that it bled out to the rest of the show and the finale was the cherry on top for my feelings of dislike. \\n\\n\r\nNow for the positives, the animation and sound. The animation of Aldnoah.Zero, while not anything outstanding, is nonetheless great. It is clean and solid, with no dips in quality throughout the entire series and with some truly stunning effects during some of the larger battle scenes. The battles are likewise greatly helped by excellent sound design, I\u2019d say that this show has some of the better-sounding battles in recent memory. Coupled with that is an amazing musical score, definitely the highlight of the series for me, it was great and I hope the same composer is on board for season two. I don\u2019t normally buy anime soundtracks, but I might just make an exception in this case. Last but certainly not least for sound is the voice cast, which to my ears sounded just fine, no issues with a single character. Worthy of high praise, I\u2019d say. \\n\\n\r\nOkay, going into quasi-spoilers for the close of this review, so be warned. Of everything I disliked about Aldnoah.Zero, the finale to this season just made everything worse and made me feel that I had wasted a full four hours. At the climax of the twelfth episode, following the successful attack against a Vers orbital platform that had landed on the Earth\u2019s surface to attack Earth HQ and with its commander, Count Saazbaum, leader of the assassination conspiracy, making an effort to finally kill the Princess, the three main characters encounter each other in the same place for the first time. Inaho was close to defeating Saazbuam before both of them being crashed into by a craft piloted by Slaine, who had spent the past few episodes trying to find the Princess and save her. The Princess ran towards Inaho in order to see if he was still alive and after finding that he is, with Slaine watching it all, she is shot twice by the Count and seemingly killed. Slaine in an emotional fury nearly empties his pistol into Saazbaum, but cannot bring himself to kill him, for whatever reason. All the while, Inaho, badly wounded, is crawling towards the Princess, with memories of their time together flashing through his head, perhaps hinting that he was finally feeling some emotion for a change. He is instructed to stop by Slaine, who has his pistol pointed at him, with Inaho responding by raising a pistol of his own which gained him a shot to the head. The ending text says that the Princess\u2019 whereabouts are unknown. \\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s a fairly paraphrased version of events of the finale, but for those who\u2019ve seen the show they know the complete circumstances. My reaction to that pivotal scene was a big WTF, I was completely in the support of Slaine throughout the whole show, particularly after the brutal torture he went through, but then he went and ended the season by sparing the man who admitted to his face that he wanted to kill the Princess and would let nothing stop him and killing the one other person besides him who cared for her as much as he did. Inaho has his flaws, but he protected Asseylum with all his strength and while it is a novel idea that a main character die at the end of a series, the circumstances are something that I obviously have a problem with. The one time in the entire show that he does something eliciting interest in me and he\u2019s repaid with a bullet, by a kid who up into that point had made some pretty brave and reasonable actions. It\u2019s just all incredibly frustrating. Despite my dislike of this show, I will be watching the second season, if only for the hope that Slaine gets his comeuppance, preferably with the Princess rejecting him and everything he had done.\\n",

            "content": "Aldanoah.Zero is bad. But more than bad, I think it is offensive. Offensive, because it fools newbies into thinking that this level of quality is good.\r\nSo, to start off with the most boring and easy to review part, the story. To put it nicely: generic garbage. It is completely un-original and steals from classics such as Gundam, but somehow manages to make it much worse. Though, to give credit where it is due the ending was quite nice. I don't have much more to say, except you have probably seen it before.\r\nThe art was alright. Nothing new, you will probably not care about it unlessyou hate the A1 pictures art style. The mechs look kind of bad though. The ANIMATION, (specifically the vehicle animation) though, is very very bad. And I am not talking Berserk bad, where it made sense, I am talking lazy CG bad. Seriously, CG is much easier to animate than normal I am surprised so many fail.The CG mechs move at like 3 frames per second, making the fight scenes almost unwatchable. Not that they would be very watchable anyway, the choreography is terrible.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound. This is one of the few points that is actually acceptable. The ost is cool and memorable, the OP is alright. Not amazing, but good.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are, like the story, generic and poorly written. The MC (who I forgot the name of) is basically your standard Intelligent, No-emotions-except-when-I-feel-like-it kind of guy. I wonder if you can name 3 mecha anime with similar, but better, protagonists? Slaine is the Zeo- sorry, Vers or whatever their name is MC, he is actually only bad. At least he has some originality to him. Oh, and then there is the Martian Princess who is the same as every other martian princess (To be fair, this came out before IBO)\\n\r\nAnd I can't even remember who the supporting cast are, apart from the maid loli who drove a jeep around for a bit. Good times.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - the most subjective part of any review. That is why I am going to keep it to a simple numerical score: 1\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR Search \"Gundam 0079 episode 1 english sub\" into google",

            "content": "*This is a review of both Season 1 and 2.*\r\nDid you know: the quote \"Fiat justitia ruat caelum\" is Latin for \"Let justice be done though the heavens fall.\" It is most commonly used to state that justice should be achieved regardless of the cost. Quite a noble statement if I do say so myself. Surely, having an anime rally around such powerful words shouldn't be too harmful, right? Well, to summarize my feelings about Aldnoah.Zero, I would say the story fell before justice was even done.\r\nAldnoah.Zero places us in a world where there is one faction of humans who have left Earth to goto Mars (or a.k.a. Vers in the anime) after the discovery of a powerful technology called the Aldnoah. Just like how Forerunner technology is worshipped in the Halo franchise, the Martians establish their social hierarchy around who can activate this Aldnoah. Of course, due to the fact that Mars is, as we know it today, an inhabitable planet, the Martians decide to conquer Earth. Sounds like H.G. Wells' War of the Worlds\u2026 Anyway, enter Inaho, a poker-faced high school student who just needs a pair of shades to complete his poker-face wardrobe, is tasked, along with his friends, to face the all-mighty and clearly superior Kataphrakts (the name of the giant robots) of the Vers Empire. Will he succeed? Why of course not\u2026right\u2026?\\n\\n\r\nThis is where I believe the story begins to fall apart. While I do respect Inaho's wits, after the first few episodes, it gets repetitive. While this structure may be good if you watch each episode a week or a few days apart, marathoning Aldnoah.Zero would reveal how dry the action sequences get.  Live. Destroy. Repeat. Further, you will most likely end up thinking \"Oh my, I wonder how this evil dude will get finished off\" before the battle even starts.\\n\\n\r\nStepping away from all the action, the writers do attempt to incorporate some forms of drama between the characters. But much like watching a burlesque dancer reveal part of her thigh, I get seduced, however, if I make any advances, I will only get bitch slapped and rejected. In Aldnoah.Zero, I wanted to see certain characters get together and much to my pleasure, the writers were leading me on. But all I was lead to was a dead end with 1000 slaps to the face and a kick from behind as part of the completion reward. Before I passed out, all I heard from the writers was that \"What were you expecting?\" \\n\\n\r\nAside from the drama, you would expect that given such an epic justice quote (remember that one?), the anime should have a good rallying theme. Nope. You don't get that with Aldnoah.Zero. The story struggled with itself in trying to incorporate that theme. At times, the story was forcibly trying to insert themes of achieving justice by any means but that was just said and done. Eventually, I think the writers saw it as a lost cause and abandoned it for some more in-depth character development. It's such a pity because it could have been so much more. Looks like the quote is used only to make the anime sound epic: \"Let justice be done though heavens fall.\" It does have a nice ring to it.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are alright at best. My favourite characters are Inko, Lt. Marito, and Rayet simply because I thought they were the more fleshed out characters. They had their desires, strengths, fears, and hate, while everyone else was just a blank slate. \\n\r\nWhile Slaine is not one of my favourites, he gets a lot of development in the second season, which was good to see. \\n\r\nInaho was just plain cold. His personality was the main reason that I dropped the show after 4 episodes (I only picked it up again because I thought I should finish what I started). While I am certain there are people who are very calm under stress, I don't think it is impossible to feel absolutely zero emotion for your teammates or make a decision purely on logic. Inaho might as well be an android for all that matters. \\n\r\nPrincess Asselyum, while she has a warm heart, she does not have the necessary characteristics to lead an entire nation. She is simply too na\u00efve to the ways of the political realm. I want to talk a little bit about her character at the end so if you haven't seen the anime yet, skip down to the END SPOILER marker.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n-----SPOILER WARNING!!-----\\n\\n\r\nAnd that ending\u2026the writers just had her emotionlessly throw her feelings out the window and leave the story to end at that. While I can make out the political motivation for her marriage, the story offered very little guidance as to how she arrives at that decision. It was the anime's version of a bitch slap.\\n\\n\\n\r\n----END SPOILER----\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOn the technical aspect of the anime, the graphics were pretty stunning. I am not a huge fan of mecha anime but I don't by any means dislike it. Giant fighting robots are pretty damn cool. Coming from that perspective, I was pretty satisfied with the cool Kataphrakt designs and battle sequences. As for the character designs and colour palette, I didn't have my socks blown off but I wasn't terribly disappointed either. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is definitely a huge highlight. From the composer who brought you the epic track of Attack on Titan, Sawano Hiroyuki's score definitely impressed my ears once again. His music was basically the glue that held the entire story together. Without it\u2026I don't even dare imagine. And as an added bonus, Kalafina (from Fate/Zero second season opening and ending of Fate/Stay Night - UBW) performs the opening to the first season. One does not simply skip a song by Kalafina.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, once I got past my despair that the characters aren't going to get anywhere, Aldnoah.Zero was entertaining. It had an easy-to-follow storyline, the eye-candy, and the epic music to accompany all those explosions. Dare I say, I would recommend this anime to anyone who watches a mecha anime here and there. If you are looking for interesting characters or simply good character development, I'm afraid Aldnoah.Zero does not have those items on the menu. Please go to the store next door titled [insert a better mecha anime here].\\n\\n\\n\r\nLet me know what you liked or disliked about Aldnoah.Zero! Do we have a similar perspective on this anime or just absolutely polar opposite? Do let me know because I would love to hear from you!",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS\r\n*ahem* \r\nIn a nutshell, this is a fairly entertaining anime, with some exciting action sequences, good plot twists, and an awesome soundtrack. Unfortunately, it suffers from rather flat, stereotypical characters, and a run-of-the-mill storyline that you might find in any other mecha anime.\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nThe plot revolves around the interplanetary conflict between the forces of United Earth and Vers Empire (Mars).  War breaks out, and a few highschool kids with military training in using Katephrakts (giant robots - I know, right?) get caught up in the mix and must fight to protect Earth against the invading Martians. Does that sound familiar? Needlessto say, the main plotline is rather weak,  but fortunately has some darn good plot twists which keep it from getting a lower rating.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe character art is drawn in a simplistic style, and brings across emotion well, though is not overly dramatic. As for the environmental art, it is well-varied and provides good backdrops for anime's scenes. The main complaint that I have is with the CGI for the Katephrakts, which is pretty clunky looking, and is sometimes painfully noticeable. However, this is only occasional, and is compensated with fast-moving camera angles, so it doesn't drag down the rating too much. Overall, the art doesn't break any beauty records for me, but it does the job.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for this anime is pretty awesome, incorporating some rather epic choir/rock mixes for the action scenes and poignant piano pieces for the more emotional scenes. I seriously have to look up some of this music on Youtube and add it to my epic study playlist later.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nI generally place anime characters into 3 categories: \\n\r\n- Good, with lots of interesting character development, mixed in with deep, fleshed out personalities. \\n\r\n- Bad, with the main characters either having no character development at all or are just downright annoying and serve no purpose to the plot. \\n\r\n- Mediocre, where the main characters are interesting enough, but are just too stereotypical/unrelateable and weren't given enough time to be fleshed out. \\n\r\nAldnoah Zero I am placing in the last category, as mediocre. The characters aren't completely unlikeable, and have some darn good voice acting which helps with this. Unfortunately, the personalities that the three main characters were given all fall into the common anime tropes - we have Asseylum playing the innocent, pure-as-snow, kawaii princess who wouldn't hurt a fly; Slaine acting as the \"wounded puppy\" , who is a good guy but gets beaten up on by everyone, for seemingly no good reason other than to make the audience get the feels; and then Inaho, who has absolutely no character at all and comes across as completely unrelateable. Seriously, he could be a robot for all the emotion he shows, because I think I've only seen him smile once, maybe twice in the entire first season, and JUST BARELY at that (like seriously, you would have missed it if you weren't paying attention). The secondary characters don't really do the rating any favours, especially with practically all of the antagonists falling under the \"arrogant rich kid\" role. I wish I could give this a higher rating, because some of the characters in this anime had such potential, but ended up falling flat as none of them were given time to develop their characters and so fell into common anime stereotypes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nDespite this anime's failings, I still enjoyed watching it, due to the entertaining plot twists and action sequences, which kept me interested. The only thing in this section I feel I need to complain about is that after a while the pacing of the battles starts to feel quite similar:\\n\\n\r\n*Villain shows up*\\n\r\nVillain: \"Nya-ha-ha I am rich and powerful and I have a bigger gun than you so KNEEL BEFORE ME etc. etc.\"\\n\r\nGood guys: \"Oh no, whatever shall we do? He's too strong!\"\\n\r\nInaho: \"I'm here to save the day!\"\\n\r\nGood guys: \"Yay!\"\\n\r\n*Inaho thinks up some brilliant plan and destroys Villain*\\n\r\nVillain: \"NOOOO, HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN TO MEEE blah blah blah\"\\n\\n\r\nStill, the action sequences were varied enough so as to keep the rather repetitive pacing hidden for a while, thus keeping the rating at a solid 7. However, I reeeeeally wish the villains were more interesting because the whole rich-and-arrogant routine gets old pretty fast.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nYes, Aldnoah Zero suffers from mediocre characters, a sub-par plot, and lame CGI, but for some reason I still enjoyed watching it despite these rather debilitating flaws. I suppose the great plot twists, the cool action sequences and the beautiful soundtrack coupled with the nice voice acting was enough to satisfy my anime-itch. Will I rewatch? Probably not, but I definitely don't regret watching it in the first place.\\n",

            "content": "I went into watching this with really low expectations, but it really wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. However it is not necessarily good either. \r\nStory: 6/10\r\nWithout spoiling too much the story is pretty generic. Generic stories aren't always bad, but it really depends what direction you go in. This anime is a classic tale of the not-so-distant future where humans have inhabited another planet. There are humans who live on Earth and Versians who live Mars. Conflict arises after an assassination attempt on the Martian princess is launched; war ensues. Honestly the story of this show reminds me of some sortof mixture between Code Geass and Gurren Lagann's plot, but not executed nearly as well.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall the art style on the characters and backgrounds looks pretty clean. Not the best art style, but it has its merits. The only reason I wouldn't give it an 8 is due to the CG mecha designs. I knew this show used CG mechs, but I was willing to watch it anyway. It's not even the fact that they're CG that bothers me, it's how difficult it is to see what is going on in the action scenes. The mechs are usually very dark, bland colors and it is difficult to tell what is going on.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe music in this show didn't really stand out to me. It's not spectacular but there is a lot of dramatic instrumentals during the action scenes and toned down background music during normal scenes. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nI haven't watched the second season, so I don't know if the character development improves. For the most part all of these characters are very one dimensional. The protagonist is pretty much 99% emotionless and for some reason is the ONLY person who can exceptionally pilot a mech. The princess is pretty much every princess character in any anime ever made; too sweet, too pure, just wants everyone to get along (probably another reason I see a lot of Code Geass and Gurren Lagann in this show). The protagonists friends are pretty unimportant as well. I feel like most of the character build up is coming from the Martian side, but I won't spoil anything. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nLike I said, really not as bad as I thought it would be. It wasn't a 10/10 but not all shows need to be in order to be watchable. I was able to consistently watch through it with no resistance and I still stand by saying it was very OK.",

            "content": "aldnoah.zero is a very good anime and i would recommend it to anyone who hasn't already checked it out. this first season, has great music and the character design is good, some characters you feel pity for, others envy, and some are so conflicted you cannot even really understand. (even after re watching it!) it is generally very enjoyable, though some of the combat scenes can get a bit repetitive and dull, they are generally very interesting as each kataphrakt (mecha) has its own set of unique abilities. its surprising that, in my opinion, the main character, inaho kaizuka, has quite a boring personality, comparedto some secondary characters. i would've rather that the story revolved around someone else, as inaho seems to be too determined and in doing so, a bit boring, or they made inaho a more interesting character, despite this i thought this was one of my favourite animes and (considering i don't watch them too much) my favourite mecha anime. watch aldnoah if you want an intriguing, gritty story with excellent characters and deep rooted politics and inner conflict.",

            "content": "The review gets a trip through spoiler town so don't complain as you just passed the warning sign. \r\nSound: The music is good but not exceptional however was else would we except from Hiroyuki Sawano. The reason it doesn't get any higher than a 7/10 for music is because while the music is decent, it's also very generic. \r\nThe sound (as in the sound effects, eg. noise of the guns and explosions, not the music) is also very generic and it sounds like any other anime out there. The mechs have the same stomping sound as any game. Furthermore the lasers sound  crap. Theyare on the \"pew pew\" level of sound that you made when you were five and pretended to be in a Gundam. \\n\\n\r\nArt: Bad art design doesn't ruin anime, neither does excessive use of CGI, Gonzo in Arpeggio of Blue Steel proved that, some anime even manages to pull off the use of CGI, Like MSG:Unicorn by combining it with clever use drawn animation. However Aldnoah.Zero does NOT WORK WITH CGI. The mechs are on Playstation One level of graphics. The mechs look and feel weightless, there is very minute screen shake when the mechs move. The guns the mechs carry have no recoil to them. While it seems I'm just pointing out details here and picking at straws, a clusterfuck is made from these tiny details and this is what polish is used for, to clear those tiny mistakes from the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe design of the good characters is... common. You have bland-chan, love-interest-chan, older-sister-san, loli-chan. You name it. The characters look like the archetypes they represent. While  this isn't breaking new ground, it isn't bad. The characters look good, the drawing itself is sharp. However, there is a huge lack of effort. The princess is the worst in this as her head frequently changes shape.\\n\\n\r\nThe design of the evil character is horrendous. For a show that wants to be called an epic the character designs are one dimensional and this is further compounded by the evil characters. The counts, although they do differentiate in uniform and mech look basically the same. The difference in uniform is minimal, it only consists of this guy has a gold button, that guy has a green medal. The most unique character of the counts is the female one, and that's because she's a different gender. Every one of the counts has a super evil grin, super evil red and black uniform and super evil voice. \\n\\n\r\nStory: This is the second weakest point of the show. If you want a synopsis go watch Gundam as this show is a carbon copy of that, minus all the character development. However it's impossible to explain why the story sucks without going into detail, so here we go! Humans found space tech, got to Mars, destroyed the Moon, started and finished Space World War 1. This resulted in the \"Counts\" (The baddies)  being stranded in the space around Earth for 15 years (Why? Their spaceships had propulsion so why not go back to Mars?). War begins when their is a assassination of the fake princess. The Counts, not following orders and without speaking to the king, declare war on Earth.\\n\\n\r\nSo begins the show, the fights follow the formula of: Aliens attack, human forces slaughtered, main character saves the day due to the power of using his brain and moving his mech. The story revolves around a robot, Inaho, who's name I had to look up as he is literally the most forgettable character ever, and his adventures with the Princess, who's name I've forgotten, the annoying loli, the rebel girl who hates everyone and the human army.  \\n\\n\r\nOn the other you get Slaine's story arc, the only character who's name I remembered, he has an emotion unlike everyone else and this consists of only blind love for the Princess. He gets into trouble and is involved in torture, which although not pointless was so extreme that I can only imagine it was to satisfy Urobutcher's fetishes. This arc is only here for exposition, shock factor due to mad torture, and the ending.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: So here we go, the worst part of the show and the reason it gets such a bad rating. Characters are the audiences way into the show, without characters a story is pointless and there is nothing to gain from watching the show. We've been delaying long enough, let's start:\\n\\n\r\nSlaine: He's competing with soldier-man for the best character award. An award that would normally be hard to achieve in a semi-decent show, however here this shit can be given to anyone. Slaine's only trait is he is madly in love with the Princess. That's it, his only use is exposition. In other words, a useless character.\\n\\n\r\nInaho: The other main character, well... I use the term \"character\" loosely due Inaho having NO CHARACTER AT ALL, his face throughout the show is the same emotionless flat face. He defeats the enemies through using tactics that consist of putting the enemy mechs in salt water, the tactics are amazingly simple, childishly so. You can also him \"self-insert-chan\"\\n\\n\r\nAsseylum: Her name is to long to write, but this is the Princess, she gets the worst drawn award and her face changes shape far too much. She is a generic addition to Inaho's harem  and that's it. \\n\\n\r\nEddelritto: Her name isn't spelled like this but she is the worst loli character ever made. Every line she says is disagreeing with Inaho.\\n\\n\r\nShigo: This is soldier-man with post traumatic stress disorder, he is the most interesting character because we know of his past and get to experience it. However, the most depressing part of his character is the fact his character arc just gets forgotten because Inaho is too important.\\n\\n\r\nYou then get a pointless series of characters made even more pointless because they are all overshadowed by Inaho. The entire show could have been called Inaho's adventures against space mechs and been just about him, as that's what everyone adds to this show. \\n\\n\r\nI've been through the baddies already and there is no need to individually separate them as they are the same character in different forms. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I can never recommend this show due to it's laziness in writing, art and story.",

            "content": "TL;DR - Like clay, so much potential in the right hands, but it's a mess in the end.\r\nWatching Aldnoah.Zero is like watching a Jackie Chan movie.  You would be amused by the crazy stunts and the perfectly choreographed fight scenes.  But if you watch it for the plot, you would be disappointed.  Aldnoah.Zero is visually and aurally brilliant (much like Jackie's stunts and fights), but in the overall scheme of things, it does not live up to the sum of its parts.\r\nGOOD - Animation\r\nVery few anime could boost stunning animation.  Aldnoah.Zero is one of the few.  Everything from the backgroundto the mecha decor, from the explosion to the energy beam, the attention to details is nothing short of exquisite.  Some people might complain about the use of CGI, but personally I find it enhances the show greatly.  It is still not as fluid as it should, but for what it's worth, it makes the scene livelier.\\n\\n\r\nMecha design is meticulously done.  Each Martian Kataphrakt have its unique style.  It is good to see that they are not your typical humanoid design.  The designers must be commended for creating something different.  Even though all Kataphrakts on Earth is the standard issue (i.e. they all look the same), Inaho's Kataphrakt managed to have accessories which make it unique in its own right.\\n\\n\r\nGOOD - Mecha Fighting Scenes\\n\\n\r\nFighting scenes are great insofar as the duel between Inaho and the \"Martian Kataphrakt of the Week (TM)\" is concerned.  Inaho's calm nature and ability to collect, analyse and take the most logical option is like watching a super computer in action.  He is emotionless and will only take what he thinks is the best possible path to complete the mission at hand, disregarding normal things like orders.  There is nothing more satisfying than to see the underdog wins against all odds.\\n\\n\r\nGOOD - Music To The Ears\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of Aldnoah.Zero is superbly done.  The background music is upbeat and fits the situation like a glove.  Tension in the battle scenes, tender in the mellow scenes.  There is not one beat out of place.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED are great.  Usually I would skip the OP and ED, but the songs made me stay every episode.  The ED song aLIEz is especially well done.  The upbeat tempo and the tension in the music is perfect for a morale boosting song.  If only the Kataphrakts has an iPod connection or bluetooth.  I can imagine the pilots listening to the song every time they go out to battle.\\n\\n\r\nBAD - The Epic Battle Everyone is Waiting For (or Lack Thereof)\\n\\n\r\nIf you like watching epic battles between troops, then you will be sorely disappointed with Aldnoah.Zero.  Yes, I know I said before that I like the fight scenes, but it is only insofar as a duel between the two people concerned.  The entire Martian invasion strategy involves the Count landing his/her castle somewhere on Earth and dispatch that one Kataphrakt (that only the Count can control) to wreak havoc on Earth, while the rest of the Martians sit inside the landing castle having a tea party, presumably.  That's like the General does all the fighting while the rest his army sits idle inside the barrack.  And guess what, the General who is supposedly well trained in using his super weapon to his absolute advantage is actually pretty crap against a high school kid who uses a training mecha and much inferior weaponry.  All you need is knowing how physics works.  So don't skip your physics class, boys and girls.\\n\\n\r\nBAD - The Usefulness Of The Earth Military (or Lack Thereof)\\n\\n\r\nWhile it is natural to see Inaho and his peers dodging, sidestepping and generally avoid things that could end their lives, the rest of the military forgets what \"avoiding being killed\" means.  Characters who are required for the plot conveniently survive every attack ranging from the mecha losing an arm to losing a head.  For all the other pilots who never spoken to Inaho (i.e. not important), they are just some useless pink garden flamingos begging to be vandalised.  They serve only two functions: a) to make the main characters look good and b) scream like a little girl who had her Barbie ran over by a tank.\\n\\n\r\nBAD - Backstory (or Lack Thereof)\\n\\n\r\nThere is not much story to speak of generally, but the backstory is almost non-existent.  We are given a 5 minute lecture on the Vers Empire and another 5 minutes lecture on the reason for the First Vers-Earth War.  But there are so many back stories that would provide a much richer understanding of the world that Aldnoah.Zero is set in.  But then again, the Vers Empire has only been in existence since 1972 (the anime is set in 2014), so there is hardly any history to be had.\\n\\n\r\nSlaine is an interesting character in his own right, but we have no idea of his origin other than that he and his father crash landed on Mars years ago.  Why the hell did they come to Mars in the first place?  Were they being chased by space pirates?  Was Slaine tricked by his dad with a promise of limitless candy?  Were they prosecuted for being devil worshipers on Earth?  How did they even evade the Mars defence when they come crashing in?  These are the sort of questions that were never answered in the series, and likely never will (great potential for some creative fanfics, though).\\n\\n\r\nUGLY - (Virtually No) Character Development\\n\\n\r\nThere is virtually zero character development in the series.  Inaho is super smart but has the personality of a garden gnome.  While he is not the first anime character to exhibit these traits (and certainly won't be the last), he is just so cold and is more like a computer than human.  His care factor is absolute zero.  Watching his friend died in front of his eyes and winning against a death machine has the same effect on him.\\n\\n\r\nPrincess Asseylum fills in the shoes of someone who is an idealist who thinks that she can \"save the world\" without resorting to violence.  Unfortunately there are already plenty of hers around in every anime that involve epic wars between two sides.  Her function as a character lacks conviction.  Sure, she serves more function than just some 1960's hippies, but Asseylum seems to be the only person at that anti-war rally as everyone else is eager to go to war.\\n\\n\r\nSlaine is possibly the most interesting character out of the three main cast.  He represents the pinnacle of pain and suffering, but his role is confusing, we don't know where he stands in the Martian society.  He is despised by every Count who knows of him, yet he seems to hold substantial status over ordinary Martians, so which is which?  He is deeply loyal to Princess Asseylum, probably because she is his only friend.  But his action says otherwise.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the supporting cast is unfortunately just as shallow.  They show more emotion than Inaho, but their care factor is just as low.  People are dying left, right and centre and all they care about is \"the military uniform doesn't look good on me\".\\n\\n\r\nThe Martian Orbital Knights, saved for a few main Counts who are required for the plot, are meant to be all powerful with their death machines decimating the populace on Earth.  But the only thing they managed to decimate is the writer's credibility as they turn from their God-like status to utterly useless and became nothing more than the \"Martian Kataphrakt of the Week (TM)\".  One minute, they were sweeping the floor with a decapitated Earth Kataphrakt.  The next minute, they were the one that got swept into the dumpster.\\n\\n\r\nThere is no chemistry between the characters.  Friendship between Inaho and Princess Asseylum stayed the same way throughout the series.  Relationship between Inaho and Slaine is fuelled by the misunderstanding of each other just because they wear a different uniform.  The show would have ended peacefully many moons ago if only the three of them would sit down and talk to each other over dinner.\\n\\n\r\nThere is no team work to speak of between Inaho and the rest of his platoon.  The writer made him so overpowering that makes everyone else looks insignificant.  They might as well sit with the audience and watch the Inaho one man show instead.\\n\\n\r\nAldnoah.Zero makes it very hard for the audience to like, let alone relate, to the characters.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION\\n\\n\r\nDespite all its shortcomings, Aldnoah.Zero is enjoyable to watch if you can ignore its fault.  But saying that is like saying you are a good person if only you didn't murder your mother.  Aldnoah.Zero has great potential.  In fact, I actually enjoyed watching it the first time round.  It is only when I started thinking about it deeper that I realised how flawed it is.  If you do end up watching the first season, I strongly urge you to commit to the second cours as well.  The ending is just too much to bear.\\n",

By episode 2 I was hooked and was pumped to watching each and every following episode.\r\nStory (9/10):\r\nBefore I introduce the story, I just want to say that this anime feels like the result if 'Attack on Titan' and 'Code Geass' had a baby.\r\nSo basically, the human race is split in 2 - the 'Terrans' and the 'Martians'.The 'Terrans' are those who reside on Earth and the 'Martians' are those who took to space and are living on Mars (though renamed to 'Verz' in the anime).\\n\\n\r\nWar breaks out between the 2 races and the story follows the life of Inaho and his friends as they do what it takes to survive through the it.\\n\\n\r\nArt (10/10):\\n\r\nPleasing to the eye and enjoyable to watch, animation was pretty good aswell so nothing to complain about really.\\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10):\\n\r\nThe music was astounding, sound tracks were really good and hyped up the mood alot during the episodes - great stand-alone aswell. Reminded me abit of 'Attack on Titans' OST's - just generally epic. The voice acting was well done aswell, voices fit their respective characters nicely.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10/10):\\n\r\nI really liked the main characters, especially Inaho - his calm and calculating attitude doesn't leave much to be desired in a MC of this genre of anime. The other characters also make it easy to emphasize with them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10):\\n\r\nA solid piece of work in my honest opinion, very little I would change, though wished the anime was longer!",

But it never did.\r\nThe art of this anime is actually pretty good. And the sound is overall very good. Especially the music. But the story and the characters are so unbeliveably stupid that I can not in good conscience rate this show above a 2/10. Had the animenot contradicted itself on every turn and had the ending not been the worst ending I have ever seen in my 13 years of watching anime (I started at the late age of 15). I'd happily give this show a high rating.\\n\r\nThere are only so many ways of saying this is garbage. I think I'll leave it at that.\\n\\n\r\nPlease I beg of you fellow anime enthusiasts.

            "content": "My review will begin with what was really great and will then end up at what was bad.\r\n9/10 Art\r\nGreat animation, nice art style, thoroughly enjoyed character design and general scenery. Nothing super outstanding, but still pretty great overall.\r\n9/10 Music/Soundtrack/Audio\r\nVoice actors matched character design perfectly. Music/Soundtrack was great, although it was similar to Guilty Crown since they share the same composer. Also, as the OST was great on it's own, the use of it in the actual anime could have been done better. Overused, but enhanced the story just enough.\r\n6/10 Enjoyment\r\nPersonally enjoyed the anime, but objectively speaking, it wasn't a very amazing anime in itself. Thiswill be explained in below sections. However, I will recommend this anime to someone. A lot of how you will enjoy it is based on how you interpret it. You may hate it or like it, it depends on you and your personal preferences.\\n\\n\r\n5/10 Story\\n\r\nLots of plot holes, not very well done/thought out, could use work. There wasn't much of a story line present, in my opinion. Sure, the anime flowed nicely, but there wasn't much of an actual story. The basis is that there is an antagonist who has a grudge against a whole being and wants to destroy it and the protagonists were pulled into that plot. Background info wasn't discussed very much and neither was the plot of the villain. We just got the basic gist of things. It was way more action oriented. Some plot twists were thrown in and a portion were good and the other seemed to be thrown in just for the twist. Somewhat predictable. Subjectively, the ending sucked. Objectively, the ending didn't make much sense to the story flow. It was abrupt and needs explanation, however the anime says that it will be explained in January 2015, so we must wait a while if it does come out. It was just nonsense.\\n\r\nAlso, general detail/development wasn't there. Inaccurate/inconsistent at some points. Who knows what's happening??\\n\\n\r\n3/10 Characters/Character Development\\n\r\nThis will be divided into three categories/subjects: Development, Villains, General Characters.\\n\r\nDevelopment- not much back story or development present. A lot of unanswered questions about characters and relationships. What relationships that were developed or revealed did not get further explanation. Characters were pretty unmemorable since you couldn't really build a connection with them or follow them very closely throughout the anime. Most of the focus was on fight scenes or the like. You do grasp the outline of the main characters, but the secondary characters are lost in the story. Who are they? Why are they there? Do they even matter? They do not get much screen time, if any. \\n\\n\r\nGeneral Characters- Empty profiles, as touched upon in the section above. You either know very little or nothing at all for each character. There isn't much depth, although there is a personality for many of the characters. About 3 of them have an actual back story: Slaine, Count Saazbaum, and Lt. Marito. I guess you can say the captain has half a back story, but it doesn't get elaborated upon at all. Disappointing, really. Could use a lot of work.\\n\\n\r\nVillains- Horrible motives, poor evil plot. At best, I can describe them as petty. There is only one person who really has a reason for any of the violence, and that is Count Saazbaum. However, his justification isn't enough for the all-out apocalyptic war he initiates, and he doesn't even explain part of his plot, which is to kill a certain someone, that, for the sake of spoiling, I will not reveal. Everyone else involved doesn't seem to have a legitimate reasoning. They've all been ingrained with a degree of hatred for the terrans, but what kind of justification does that give to try and destroy Earth? Resentment that would have otherwise been kept in was just catalyzed by Saazbaum's personal revenge-seeking. All of this could have been avoided, or done differently. Saazbaum surely had numerous ways to avenge whatever it was, right? But no one questions him. Huh.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall 6/10\\n\r\nAveraging out my scores will output a 6.4/10. I liked watching this anime, but things could have been done way better. The story and characters essentially were not there but the anime flowed nicely along with great sound and great animation. I would recommend this anime to someone, however, not highly. Some points make you sit on the edge of your seat and craving more, other points were way sub-par. Again, it is all up to your point of view. Many people rave over this anime, other view it with a more critical eye. It is quite enjoyable as a whole. When looked into detail, it is flawed significantly.",

            "content": "As a fan of Ei Aoki's work, and after Re:Creators cemented his directing style as one of my favorites, I felt a slight obligation to check out Aldnoah Zero, a series reputable for how dogshit it is (at least amongst the anime fans i associate with)\r\nNeedless to say, that popular opinion is on point... mostly.\r\niI would be prudent for me to say that while this series is bad, and I mean REALLY BAD, I still want to point out that there are a small number of things about this series that were actually decent, if not good. \r\nFirst of all, the score by Hiroyuki Sawanois expectedly quite good, and often helps to make the endless horribly written action scenes be a bit exciting. And the directing does a bit more to compensate for shit writing and dully written scenes as well.\\n\\n\r\nThere were MANY action scenes that, from a writing standpoint, had really lame scenarios, and characters enacting contrived tactics. But the way the scenes are shot, and the competent use of music made them enjoyable enough. However, that doesn't make the action scenes good per se. Like I said, they are still ultimately bogged down in shit writing. But at least on a base level, these scenes managed to be like a 6/10 at best.\\n\\n\r\nOne other thing positive worth pointing out are the CG Mechs, and a couple of their designs. A common thing I hear from people are that the CG mechs suck and appear really jarring and out of place. Personally, I think this point comes from people just having a general stigma against CG, and lets that bias inform how the percieve the mechs in this show. I thought the CG was quite well done, and had genuine quality to them. They felt like a part of the world, and often where shown from angles, or shots that obscured any imperfections you'd expect to be there.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, while I do think the CG is well done, it's not exactly ALWAYS like that. Some of the designs lend themselves better to being rendered in CG, and some, namely the martian Mechs, don't. Their sleeker, clean designs make their CG nature feel more obvious. Whereas the bulkier, more gritty Terran mechs look pretty good bydirect comparison.\\n\\n\r\nThat, however, is the last of any praise I can give this series, because EVERYTHING ELSE IS COMPLETE CRAP; and by \"everything\" I mean the story and characters.\\n\\n\\n\r\nRight out the gate, things aren't looking up; because the premise was instantly boring to me. The story is about two factions of humans, one hailing from Mars, with superior technology, and the other being the unremarkable Earthling type. They have some lore explaining this; but it's presented in a really dry way (as is almost all of the expository dialogue). I don't quite know how to explain what is so boring about the story itself. It's just so... unremarkable, I guess? It's just some lame-ass war with mechs in it. There's just nothing special about it. Read the synopsis for yourself if you don't believe me. It just some basic conflict between two factions.\\n\\n\r\nThe two factions aren't interesting in any way. The folks on Earth are just bland. We know a few things about their culture, like how they give military training to teenagers because they are paranoid about another war starting with the Martians, but that's reall all there is to them. The Martians more or less get a similar treatment, albeit with a bit more fleshing out as the series went on. Basically, they are racist against Terrans and want to take over Earth because they were too stupid to terraform Mars before colonizing it. That may sound interesting, but any chance of it being so is crushed by the overwhelmingly dull and flat way we learn that information (tactless expository dialogue).\\n\\n\r\nThe cast pretty much has the same problem. With the added bonus of being mostly forgettable. The main three character I can at least remember the names and faces of, but the entire supporting cast are about as memorable as what I ate for breakfast on this exact date, 5 years ago. Not that there is much to remember though, as almost all of them get very little, if any, genuine characterization. Any characterization they do get hardly felt like it mattered or added anything worthwhile to the narrative. Such as that one guy's whole PTSD issue that didn't matter or go anywhere.\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters don't even have character arcs (Well, i guess Slaine was supposed to, but I can't tell if it is or not, because he seems to just act without thinking).\\n\\n\r\nInaho, the supposed protagonist is about as boring and monotone as the performance given by whoever played him. his one defining character dynamic is that he is smart. And the series shows us this by having him pull mastermind battle strategies out of his ass. \\n\\n\r\nOh, and the Princess is just kinda there, and nice, and pretty. And that's about it...\\n\r\nThis all may seems reductive, but the really is just so little to actually say about any of these characters. They didn't even leave a strong enough impression for me to care about properly describing them anyway (not that I didn't)\\n\\n\r\nOne last thing that must be said, that I haven't seen being discussed, is how unappealing the aesthetic of the show is. For all the decent directing, and the cool shots, The color pallette of this show is just constant, perpetual GREY. There were times where I felt completely inundated in nothing but neutral tones. So many of the baclgrounds are dominated by GREY steel/metal, or GREY rubble, or GREY concrete structures. CONSTANT GREY, GREY, GREY EVERYWHERE. Shots might be well framed, but characters are drowning in GREY. I AM DROWNING IN GREY. WE ARE ALL DROWNING IN GREY.\\n\\n\r\nSeriously, this show is dominated by that one, really drab color. It's not like you can't do anything good with grey tones. But Aldnoah Zero goes overboard with how lacking in variety the colors are. And the characters are often pretty lame too.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo in conclusion, this series is a drab mess of bad writing, a boring story, dull and forgettable characters, an all too G R E Y  A E S T H E T I C, and some pretty decent directing and music to make the overall package at least bearable enough to watch completion.\\n\\n\r\nWould not recommend. Don't touch this series with a ten foot pole unless treating it as some weird case study. \\n\\n\r\n3.8/10\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Upon landing, astronauts discovered an enchanted utility later referred to as \"Aldnoah,\" giving the astronauts a status of superiority. Soon, many humans have relocated to Mars, and have adapted to the name \"Martians.\" After Princess Asseylum, a royal Martian princess, descends onto Earth in an attempt to create a treaty between both planets, a war breaks out between Earth and Mars, and Martiansoldiers begin to descend from the sky, riding steel giants, intent on exterminating humanity.\\n\\n\r\nStory-  7\\n\r\nArt-  7\\n\r\nSound-  10\\n\r\nCharacter-  7\\n\r\nEnjoyment-  7\\n\r\nOverall-  8\\n\\n\r\n*Honestly, my feelings are quite conflicted on this anime. The was it was supposed to be 'deep' with the whole world-building thing went wrong. The story doesn't feel deep at all, the only thing really that caught my emotions was Marito's situation in the past.\\n\r\nI feel like they could have gone into depth for more things, but at the same time I feel like that would have steered the anime off course.\\n\r\nThe pace is something else I feel conflicted about. \\n\r\nRegardless, here's my opinion on each section.\\n\\n\r\nStory  : 7\\n\r\nI feel like the story would be a 6 if it weren't for the ending. \\n\r\nHonestly, I feel like the story should have had a real goal, rather than just going along with whatever comes. However, that's also a good thing because that's how it is in real life.\\n\r\n**The ending shocked me, I was expecting a great victory and a happy ending (because that's how it tends to be in anime, or the anime I've seen at least.) I think the shock of the ending was good, it left questions which makes the viewer want to watch the next season.\\n\r\nThe story overall was fair, in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nArt  : 7\\n\r\nI'm not a very good judge of art in anime, but the art in this wasn't bad. I don't feel it was noteworthy either, though. \\n\r\nThe style itself wasn't particularly special, but I liked it and I liked the effort put into the robots and explosions.\\n\r\nThe art overall was good, in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nSound  : 10\\n\r\nThe character voices are fantastic, particularly Marito, Inaho and Slaine. \\n\r\nI especially love the music in this anime. \\n\r\nEach song complemented the anime perfectly, especially the OSTs during the fight scenes and the sad scenes. \\n\r\nThe opening song and ending song also fit perfectly. Hiroyuki Sawano did a wonderful job. I'm looking forward to see if he keeps it up in the second season!\\n\r\n(I love it a lot more than I made it sound.)\\n\r\nThe sound overall was outstanding, in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter  : 7\\n\r\nI don't feel like many characters were particularly great.\\n\r\nThe anime only goes into depth in one character's past : Marito. (Slaine's past was also shown, but not as in depth.) While his past was important for the story to continue, Inaho's past could have been explored a little more. (E.g: Why is he living with his sister? What happened to his parents?)\\n\r\nWhile each character has their own personality, none stood out except Inaho.\\n\r\nInaho was particularly calm all throughout the anime, which is different from the main characters in the anime I've seen so far. The typical main character in my experience(especially when male) are very 'gung-ho' and are easily angered, making them make reckless decisions. Inaho was very different, it was almost like he was created for the purpose of war, as he always sees the logical decision, not letting emotions take over. He made reckless decisions, but they were always made from logic, rather than emotions. Even when his friend died right in front of him at the beginning, he didn't shed a tear. (However, he definitely showed emotion at the end.)\\n\r\nThe characters overall were good, in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment  : 7\\n\r\nAs with the story, I think this would be a 6 if it weren't for the ending. \\n\r\nI was honestly dreading watching a mecha anime after Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann was the first mecha anime I watched, and I really didn't like it. However, Aldnoah Zero was different, and I enjoyed it. I wish I had seen this before TTGL.\\n\\n\r\nOverall  : 7.75 (8)\\n\\n",

            "content": "Confused bad writters galore! but may still satisfy some.\r\nNote: I'm reviewing Aldnoah Zero season 1 and 2 as a complete series in this review.\r\nAldnoah Zero is a series that starts out with the promise of a great future but it's kinda sad that it falls into this huge mess.\r\nThe series suffers from a some technical problems, some sloppy editing, the CG-mechs and sadly the directing but the main issue lies with it's characters and story.\r\nSide characters seem to be written as dumb as possible to make the main character Inaho look like a genius. The series portrayal of Inaho as the best strategic prodigy becomesso overbearingly obnoxious that eventually it becomes clear that he is simply a Gary Stu style character and his emotionless and stale personality make him even less intresting than he already is.\\n\\n\r\nThe secondary main character Slaine however is a much more interesting and engaging character which the writers seemed to realise as more focus was put on him on the second half. The problem arises as the story seem to not understand where it's going and what kind of story it wants to tell. Action set pieces takes place and actions of our new focus Slaine makes less and less sense.\\n\r\n The series does try to explain his actions giving us glimpse what truly is going on but it feels like only us the viewers saw them as by then end it was clear these hints of great storytelling just flew over the writer's heads, making you think \"Why is this happening? Why were they doing this again?\" during critical and big dramatic moments.\\n\\n\r\nAldnoah Zero is also in the habit of making bold story decision and take unexpected turns just to go back on them later. This makes the whole experience feel cheap or severely underwhelming. Even more infuriating is that sometimes, these events actually result in a boon for the main characters. The worst example of this is what happens at he series mid point (Between season 1 and season 2).\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion:\\n\r\nWhile season 1 has received alot of criticism from alot of people I do have to say that it I enjoyed most of the episodes despite the huge presence of Inaho but the absolute writting mess that is season 2 is really drags the whole series down. I would say if that if you enjoy self insertion, power dream characters, melodrama for the sake of melodrama and that character actions doesn't need to be reasonable and logical you might enjoy it. The rest of you, don't bother.\\n\\n\r\nPs. The more I think about this series the less I like it.",

            "content": "I have been a fan of Gen Urobuchi since before I knew his name. The first show of his I watched was Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom, which impressed me with its emotional gravity and excellent sound design. \r\nThen, I saw Fate/Zero, Madoka, and Psycho-Pass: of the former two, nothing new remains to be written, while the latter was a fresh cyberpunk drama featuring mature interplay between complex characters.\r\nThen, I saw Gargantia, whose brilliantly fresh and optimistic vision of a waterlogged Earth was outstanding against the forced grimness of the other shows of the time.\r\nAnd now we have Aldnoah.Zero, a show about high schoolers whopilot robots. Needless to say, I'm disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nAldnoah's story about the war between Earth and the Vers Empire of Mars is nothing new. The plight of the hopelessly outgunned Earthlings against the arrogant (and very Anglicized) aristocracy is very reminiscent of Code: Geass' Elevens/Britannians dichotomy, perhaps intentionally so. Yet while a good story doesn't necessitate an original setting, it does require a certain freshness in the writing, in the dialogue, and most of all, in the characters. Aldnoah fails utterly at all three of these.\\n\\n\r\nThe lead character of Aldnoah is Inaho, and I mean it when I say he is one of the worst anime protagonists I have ever endured. Throughout the show's twelve episodes, he emotes not once despite the escalating stakes surrounding him (as an early example, his reaction when a missile is coming: \"A missile is coming.\"). As an apparent strategic savant, Inaho is able to effortlessly dispatch any opponent with an intricate plan that exploits weaknesses in the enemy's technology, but he is so emotionally dead, one wonders if he actually is a savant, and if so, it's still okay to laugh at him.\\n\\n\r\nSurrounding Inaho is a cast of unoffensive, uninteresting character archetypes. The most prominent is the Princess Asseylum, who acts like princesses always do in these shows. She is established as Inaho's love interest (because of course she is), despite his unfathomable coldness and apathy, and generally serves to wax poetic about the state of humanity, the futility of war, &c. (She also hogs the screen for most of the show, unfairly pushing Rayet, who is clearly the BEST girl, out of the spotlight.)\\n\\n\r\nThe story, such as it is, follows an assassination plot on the princess, which is used as an excuse for the Martian aristocracy to declare war on Earth. The princess, who obviously survives, subsequently tries to make her way to the headquarters of Earth's government to declare her survival and mitigate the war. The progress for this journey is very poorly expressed, as too much time is spent inside various ships, with characters engaging in interpersonal drama. At times, the pacing seems forced, with an enemy robot introduced just to make things interesting again.\\n\\n\r\nThere is little more to say about this story. The robot fights are well-scripted, and should entertain fans of clever combat. It is worth noting that Inaho's victories never feel like lazy writing (other than why an unremarkable shit like him is so skilled when the military elite is so incompetent), but feel like well-considered assessments of the sci-fi technology at hand. \\n\\n\r\nAll this is portrayed in a vibrant and expressive art style that takes advantage of lighting to set the mood of the scene. There are not as many establishing shots of the landscape as would be expected for a show that moves around so much, but Aldnoah makes up for it with its well-designed characters. The music, by Hiroyuki Sawano, is pretty excellent as well, even if one or two tracks are repeated rather profusely.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the art is offset by Aldnoah's egregious use of CG modeling for its robots. Each robot (horrendously called Kataphrakts), from cannon fodder to final boss, is expressed through CGI, which is all too conspicuous when it appears to have a different frame rate than the rest of the action. It doesn't help that the majority of the robots are terribly overdesigned, getting more and more needlessly extravagant as the show goes on.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, I am looking forward to the second half of the show, which begins next February. While I would hate to spoil anything, the show implies that it will begin to shift focus between more of the supporting cast members, meaning less screen time will be devoted to its awful principal cast.",

            "content": "There\u2019s a splash of racism in Aldnoah.Zero (AZ) from the Versians toward the Terrans, and considering how bland the Terrans are, I really can\u2019t blame them. Despite the screen time between both factions being roughly even, we learn almost nothing about the Terrans beyond their own brand of racism; what are each of the characters like? How do they fit into the story beyond the fighting? What are they thinking? All of this and more\u2026are never addressed proper.\r\nIt\u2019s especially egregious with the main character of the Terrans, the tactician Inaho Kaizuka. The good news is he\u2019s a breath of fresh air from the folks pilotingan overpowered mech, being a guy whose mind is the incredible weapon as strategy after strategy topples supermech after supermech. The bad news is we scarcely get a sense of who he is. It\u2019s like the writers wanted to make a silent badass and instead created someone emotionally dead. A character like him can work, but it\u2019s vital to know what he thinks else he\u2019s just going through the motions.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a scene in the first episode where Inaho and his friends are out in the city. As a missile approaches for a terrorist attack, he says \u2018We should get out of here. A missile is coming\u2019 with no sense of urgency. To call him emotionally reticent would be an understatement. I could possibly explain that Inaho\u2019s required military training might have made him stoic, except the Terran veterans are more reactive to everything than he is. There\u2019s a better sense of what he\u2019s like in season two, but his strong sense of non-reaction makes for one of the weakest characters of the entire series.\\n\\n\r\nSorry, I ranted too much and didn\u2019t explain the situation proper. The story goes that people from Earth (Terra) have managed to colonize Mars (Vers) thanks to the discovery of super technology from thousands and thousands of years ago. But, the technological superiority of the Martians (AKA Versians) has somehow sparked a war between them and the Earthlings (or the Terrans). I\u2019m not sure how this causes war since they moved to Vers of their own will, but the series does a decent job at explaining how the conflict started as the story goes on.\\n\\n\r\nAfter a terrorist attack on a Vers diplomat visiting Terra, the Versians see fit to continue fighting a war that had halted some 15 years before the story. With the super technology of Aldnoah at their backs, the 37 Orbital Knights of Vers crash Terra with supermechs that are more than a match against the greater Terran numbers. Unfortunately, it\u2019s hard to care for the Terrans despite the Versians being initially painted as the \u2018bad guys\u2019 of the ordeal. Like I said earlier, the problem with the Terrans is we don\u2019t get a sense of who they are.\\n\\n\r\nNot that knowing who they are necessarily makes anything better. We have one character who suddenly becomes a love interest of sorts for Inaho during season two, another character whose war scars don\u2019t add anything to the story, and a bunch of other characters whose most noticeable thing about one being an ironic name. We\u2019re supposed to care for the Terrans because the Versians are clearly the \u2018bad guys,\u2019 but we should be able to care about them on their own merits.\\n\\n\r\nI say this as if the Versians are awesome, but overall they\u2019re a few ranks short of well written. A lot of them range from stereotypically evil to a hilarious degree to some genuinely nice characters who are somehow more likable than most of the Terrans. Saazbaum\u2019s story especially shows why there\u2019s a war at all, and it\u2019s difficult not to sympathize with him despite his actions. And while we don\u2019t see it much in the story proper, flashbacks of the relationship between Asseylum Vers Allusia and Slaine Troyard are just decent enough to anchor the struggles they face through both seasons.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of, let me talk about Slaine AKA the only well written character in the series. Aside from his backstory giving a sense of why he fights, it also ties into the overall story by acknowledging that even the Orbital Knights can only achieve so much without Terran help. His conflict in season one explores what it means to want to serve your country (or\u2026planet) despite all opposition, and during season two his relationship with Asseylum becomes the perfect metaphor for Terra-Vers relations; the further apart they grow, the more hostile Terra and Vers are to each other.\\n\\n\r\nThe only complaint I\u2019d make here, is how Slaine is so often short-ended that his struggles almost feel unnatural, as if the world was made for him to suffer in rather than him suffering in the world. The amount of times he\u2019s literally and figuratively kicked around just stop him from being anything more than a good character. Otherwise, every action he takes even during season two is mostly believable. It\u2019s easy to find him unlikable for some of the things he does, but the story takes care to explain the actions he believes he must take despite himself.\\n\\n\r\nAnd when Slaine, Inaho, or anyone else take action, a fight often follows. In a word, AZ\u2019s aesthetics are positively slick. The coloration between the characters and backgrounds meshes flawlessly with the mecha CGI, while the mechs themselves adhere to a design philosophy to easily tell them apart; the Versian supermechs are sleek, smooth, and shiny, while the ordinary mechs of the Terran side are rusted rundown robots. There\u2019s a real sense of bullet for bullet superiority from the Versians, to say nothing of how the fights often play out.\\n\\n\r\nThe fights themselves are almost a microcosm of real robots VS super robots. The Terran mechs are slow but methodical, as they won\u2019t be doing too many crazy stunts if at all, and don\u2019t hold well if a strong round of bullets so much as crosses them the wrong way. Compare this to the Versian supermechs, who can take it as well as they dish it out, and can dish it out faster than most of the Terran mechs can keep up with. The only thing keeping the fights down is also its greatest strength; the fights are tactics VS power, and because \u2018power\u2019 is on the \u2018villain\u2019 side,\u2019 most fights are a foregone conclusion. Still, knowing who\u2019s going to win isn\u2019t the same as knowing how somebody wins.\\n\\n\r\nAccompanying the epic visuals is an equally grand soundtrack. There aren\u2019t that many tracks in and of themselves, but what\u2019s there is instantly recognizable. \u2018Keep On Keeping On\u2019 and \u2018aLIEz\u2019 are excellent pieces that perfectly set the incoming mood whether things are going to change for the better or worse. Series\u2019 music composer Hiroyuki Sawano does an excellent job elevating action scenes that would otherwise be hard to care about, and despite all the bombast the show knows when to dial down the music as some of the more intense moments revolve around deafening silence.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, \u2018deafening silence\u2019 is a philosophy that ended up going to Inaho and brought down the Terran side of the story to a large degree. Honestly, I do LIKE AZ, but my gushing for Slaine isn\u2019t nearly enough to suggest this series even as something passably enjoyable. The Terrans are completely ineffectual while the Versians are decent at best. Aldnoah Zero isn\u2019t a bad anime, but its efforts to be decent have been absolutely Slaine.",

            "content": "I've stumbled upon the name 'Aldnoah.Zero' when I was on social media, and it never really left me since. I've heard good reviews about the show and to my surprise the soundtrack was composed by Hiroyuki Sawano, one of my favorite anime composers (Guilty Crown, Kill la Kill, and Shingeki no Kyojin are one of my favorite works from him) so I was very eager to watch! So I made some time to watch the anime in one sitting (call me a douche :p), and I was utterly disappointed.\r\nSpoilers below:\r\nStory: 8\r\nFrom the start, I was immediately mesmerized by the unique storytelling of the Martians/Tehrans (isthat how you spell it?) and was very interested to know more about the history of aldnoah and the lineage bestowed with powers by the celestials. The story had (I really want to stress this) a lot A LOT of potential to be really good had it not been for the characters (which I will take time to explain later). Although the story was not to blame for it\u2019s overall bad enjoyment, it was rather the characters and the overall execution/pacing of the anime that really killed it for me\u2026 The story stand alone is worthy of praise by itself in its uniqueness and mystery, disregarding all other aspects. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 6 \\n\r\nThe art was alright, nothing else really stood out. The scenery was very beautifully detailed at times (especially the skies), but the setting was either on earth (morning or sunset), or a dark ambient castle setting on Mars.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nMy favorite tracks were any songs sung by Mika Kobayashi; her voice is absolutely mesmerizing and clearly distinguishable in a good way! However, I was expecting more of Sawano after his great works with Guilty Crown, Shingeki no Kyojin and Kill la Kill\u2026 there weren\u2019t any tracks that stood out other than \u201cAliez\u201d. I was hoping for a soundtrack maybe similar to Guilty Crown\u2019s because the setting takes place in a somewhat futuristic dystopia.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3 \\n\r\nFrom the get-go, I was already ready to drop the anime after the second episode after being introduced to Inaho, who is the most lame excuse of a Gary Stu I have ever seen. I think the anime tried portraying him as level-headed, cool, and clever boy but ending failing as result. His stoicism and lack of emotion was very unappealing and came off as super unnatural. I would have at least hoped he would have displayed some sort of development towards the end of the season but he didn't? Then the writers attempt to show that he actually had loved Princess Asseyllum when he had showed no emotion in the first place??? It just seems like a bunch of nonsense and contradicts the his whole character (which the writers badly wrote in the first place). Also, I could really care less about Inaho\u2019s friends because they are just staple anime tropes that I have seen in dozens of other animes (but the reason to that could be because they are not necessarily focused on in the first place). I\u2019m also confused by Cruhteo? Wasn\u2019t he already aware of the plotted coup against the royal martian family when he had fought alongside the other nights or was he just never informed?? Because that basically meant he was fighting for nothing for over half the season which is complete bull. I never really cared about Rayesh either, maybe if they had given her a backstory I would have pitied her more, but I find her resolve and initiative really unworthy. I tried to like to Princess Asseylum because she was a main character but I just couldn't bring myself to like her. I can\u2019t stand Mary Sues\u2026 I tried watching all the episodes but ending up stopping at 10 because I couldn\u2019t take it anymore. The only character I found truly likable was Slaine. he actually had a backstory and showed human characteristics unlike other people in the anime. He had an unending determination to save Asseylum which I really admire. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3\\n\r\nEach episode tried so hard to leave off on a cliffhanger, and it didn't really work for me (if they were trying to achieve the same level that Shingeki no Kyojin was trying to do\u2026), I just wasn't hooked. I will say this (like in all other reviews I have written) strong characters can carry a weak plot but weak characters cannot carry a strong plot. In the case of Aldnoah.Zero, the weak characters were unable to carry a strong plot all the way through, thus it turned to some sort of a convoluted mess in the end. I will however be watching the second season to see how things will change, knowing the show still has potential. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n",

EDIT: Themusic was good, I was just kidding :P also 7 of 20 people found this helpful, WOW\\n\r\nFor Character 2/10\\n\r\n  This story revolves around two mcs, the first one is Kaizuka Inaho, who is the epitome of the cliched,stoic, harem king who is the smartest character in the series, making everyone else around him seem forgettable and stupid. The second mc is  Troyard Slaine, who is actually an earthling himself therefore the martians often discriminate and abuse him (racist martians)\\n\r\npersonally he is my favorite character because he seems more 'real'. And like I've mentioned before the other characters were just dumb and forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 6/10\\n\r\nIt is fairly enjoyable and a little (microscopic) humor here and there.\\n\r\nSo overall I give it a mediocre 5/10 (just like this review)\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "A conflicted battle between Earth and Mars, The Princess used as a sacrifice to start war once again ...  \r\n\"Let Justice Be Done, Though the Heavens Fall\" - Aldnoah.zero\r\nStory (9)\r\n The story was.. how do I say it? Its was a clean one. There were parts that were hard to believe, . Just how fragile are humans exactly? The mecha robots(Kataphrakt) just fling them away like a piece of flimsy paper. It just makes a person question how weak and unarmed they are without something like machines. In fact an example could be Rayet's  father being crushed in a matter of secondsafter successfully (thinking) exterminating Mars princess. The ironic thing is he got killed by the same person who ordered him to. haha Poor Rayet was left to mourn. The story left me out of my seat and my eyes alert.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8)\\n\\n\r\n First off there are no such things as a flawless one. There were minor things that I didn't like.. like how the King of Mars was a little too foolish. He was easily ticked off by his enemies believing every word they said, it made me mad that he declared war once again. I wanted to yell \"Hey mister, I don't care what you are  but don't you know the consequences and how many people are going to be killed under your stupid demand?!\" \\n\\n\r\nWhat was disturbing was more than his actions but to put it the animators did a very poor job of the kings structure. He looked like an old lady if you asked me. Just his image was spoiled, it made me question \"Was this really the guy who founded the Vars empire and was given right of supreme authority to rule the Martians?\" .. huh, I guess this is what happens when you get old.\\n\\n\r\n I honestly liked Slaine and Inaho. I just props for the creators who gave them such unique names as for the other characters too. Slaine is a character who acts upon his feelings but he did swear his loyalty to the princess in the end. He got beaten up but he never gave information to the enemy. Slaine is what you call a knight, a hero. I was sad that kind of changed afterwards. As for Inaho, I liked characters that have intelligence and this guy did what I adored. He is calm, smart and calculative (top of the class), something I admired in him. He reminded me of Lelouch, except once has the power of absolute obedience while the other just had his brain. heh. I can't wait what kind of development they make next.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9)\\n\\n\r\nTo be frank, I enjoyed watching the whole season, every thing wasn't hard to interpret anymore once you get into the mood. Humans can do pretty extraordinary things, it's entertaining to see towers being blown up plus strategies being discussed, and bitter memories. Either way this story made me look at the future and all the possibilities that goes with it. They challenge me, humans are really something.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound (10)\\n\\n\r\n This part is the most vital part of the review since the art and sound gives the anime the pure action and liveliness. The same as bringing the light to moon. The music is catchy plus foreign and making the story suspenseful when it's there. The sound of the characters is just right pitched and serves the characters purpose as they are assigned to. It's a good coordination to the story. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9)\\n\\n\r\nThe start was slightly confusing with all the real actions but let the characters explain and you got the whole thing in your head. The moon being blown up idea wasn't that bad but it shocked me that Earth lives without it, it felt weird. The action was pretty intense and I always get all fan-girly when Inaho shows up to save the day. I have to thank Olympus Knights and A-1 Pictures for making this series happen. It's was a masterpiece combined with all the work people put together. I enjoyed this whole series, I cannot wait for more.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Finally, I can write a review!\r\nI don't usually do these, so pardon me if I step on any unnamed conventions.\r\nNo spoilers in this review.\r\nFirst things first; Aldnoah.Zero was one of the much-hyped animes Summer 2014, mostly cuz of it's tag (Let justice be done, though the heavens fall) and Urobuchi having done a few episodes. All I knew about him was that he wrote Psycho Pass (which I liked), among others, so I didn't pay much attention to that. It's about an alternate timeline to our Earth, where a hypergate to Mars was found on the Moon in the first moon landing. Earth then colonizedMars, had a falling out with it, and initial war. This eventually stopped and leads us to the setting, an uneasy truce betweeen UEHQ (United Earth HQ) and Vers (Mars. Why they named it Vers, I have no clue). And, if you haven't guessed it yet, it is a mecha anime.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 8\\n\r\nThe storyline of Aldnoah.Zero seems generic, and extremey mundanely so. A war between Earth and another planet involving giant robots, controlled by high schoolers? Seriously? And really, this was the reason I wasn't about to give this a shot. However, there are several things different here; a few other themes are put in here. A theme that I would say is bordering on Racism, where the 'Versians' consider themselves superior to the 'Terrans', along with a bit of other stuff that I can't really define.\\n\r\nThe selling point however, is that this is basically Gundam; but before you get all huffy and leave due to OP mechs killling small fry, it's Gundam in REVERSE. Our hero, the high schooler, has the puny useless mech, while the opponent has the OP mech that is apparently unstoppable. A bit like Code Geass' Lelouch, using smarts, they take down the mechas to beat them. And, at least in the first two OP mecha's cases, I was astounded as to the brilliance of the protagonist. \\n\r\nWhich, unfortunately, brings us to the worst part of Aldnoah.Zero:\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 3\\n\r\nCharacterization is dreaful in Aldnoah.Zero. The protagonist, Inaho, has, as a youtuber I do not recall so aptly put it, \"The emotional depth of a brick\". He NEVER changes expressions, and is absolutely deadpan about everything. Attempts at characterization fail miserably, and potential love interests don't even seem like he likes the girl until it is specifically pointed out by a character, as if to say, \"Look guys, I know you're supposed to figure his out yourselves, but since you can't, here you go, those two are totally a couple despite one guy never even smiling and seemingly not caring about her; It's totally legit\". Rayet's arc was completely unnecessary and could have been used to either make her more likeable (or done more with her than give the audience cheap sob stories) or to develop the protagonist, Inaho's, character instead. They just succeed in messing up characters instead and ruin them. The characters (except Inaho's sister, Captain Magbaredge and Lt. Marito) where not at all likeable and I found it hard to care about them at all.\\n\\n\r\nART: 10\\n\r\nThe art in Aldnoah is outstanding, it's a veritable feast to the eyes. The mecha's special effects and explosions were great to watch, and the landing castles' descent was truly epic. \\n\r\nWell. Yeah. Art was awesome. On to music!\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 10\\n\r\nThe music in Aldnoah made me play a few songs on repeat. Especially the song that plays at the descent (I say cry (lol people thought it said 'fry')) and the OP, I must admit. The OSTs in general were great and it was annoying to find out that the sound track hadn't been released yet at the time. Should have been released now though... I ought to go play it on repeat ^^\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT & OVERALL: 7\\n\\n\r\nI think enjoyment and overall go hand in hand, don't you? Aldnoah.Zero is a great watch, although undoubtedly will not make your list of favorite anime. While I hope the issues I had with it (characters plz) will be fixed in the next season, it annoys me to no end that the final episode was a cliffhanger designed to shock and force the reader into watching the next season (airing winter 2015, so next January). However, unless you are a hardcore anime fan, or any kind of critic, in which case you will be appalled by the characters and think a 7 a generous score, you will probably enjoy it, and I'd recommend you giving it a shot.",

            "content": "Plot: The pacing is pretty decent with the only issue being that the action always comes in the latter half of the episode, making it somewhat predictable. Exposition in the first episode was done by having characters explain things they already know, which is the worst way to do it.\r\nCharacters: The greatest weakness of the show. Very little development, with the MC Inaho being an empty shell of a person. I have nothing against smart and unfeeling characters, but that's all Inaho has going for him; we don't get to see him as a person. Slaine is the deepest character in the show withestablished realistic motives and pretty badass behavior. The last episode was provoked by Inaho being an idiot back in episode 6 for a forced conflict. Plus, Inaho is somehow smarter than every single one of Earth's military geniuses. No one else thinks they should do something other than stand around and wait to be killed. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Art is rather detailed and clear, with some inconsistencies. CG isn't all that bad, and depending what platform you watch it on, can even look kind of good occasionally. \\n\\n\r\nMusic: Hallelujah, Hiroyuki Sawano has returned! He's the main reason I was so hyped for this show and he didn't disappoint, with the track FireStar being one of my favorite songs from him. The only problem is that sometimes the show uses a song where the scene isn't quite exciting enough to be suited to the awesome song playing, and that kind of wore down the novelty of the music. \\n\\n\r\nVerdict: Turns out that Butch Gen only came up with the show, and didn't actually write it, which explains why it was such a letdown instead of the savior of mecha we all thought it would be.",

This is not how a \"cool\" character is supposed to act. He displays no emotions and no character as a matter of fact.

            "content": "Gen Urobuchi, screenwriter/writer of shows such as Psycho-Pass, Fate/Zero and Madoka Magica shows his prowess once again in Aldnoah.Zero, which is honestly the best mecha anime I have ever seen. Over the course of the series I felt more and more immersed in the anime's story and characters, seeing them live their lives and seeing them change through the struggles they had been through. Likely the best part about this anime, though is the characters. Aldnoah is interesting in the sense that it gives us a main character on both sides of the conflict, each with differing views and motivation. On one side we haveInaho, the most calm mofo who ever lived (which is ironic because one of the characters he works with is named Calm) who always had the answers. Inaho was actually the most disappointing part of this anime, though, because of the point I made in the previous sentence: he always has the answer. He is the master strategist, and always seems to pull some sort of magical answer out of his ass. On the other side, however, we have Slaine. Slaine is probably my favorite character in this series because of how hilariously unlucky he is. Seriously, so many time, he just happened to get there a second too late or something, and that's what makes him such a good character, because he keeps on trying. This is the part where one would expect me to talk about the ending, so here we go. I didn't mind it. I actually liked it. At the point it was at I felt that I wouldn't have even minded if there wasn't a sequel. Anyway: sound. Sound was the only part of this anime that wasn't as good as the rest of it. I found a lot of the soundtrack to somewhat dull on its own, and some of it just didn't mix well with what was happening (I set fire). I can't really rate the voice acting, since I don't speak Japanese (I do hope it gets dubbed though). I enjoyed Aldnoah a great deal, and the only real flaws I can see are how stubbornly overpowered Inaho is and a few songs on the OST. Aldnoah.Zero tells a chilling tale of loss of innocence and tells of how to look at something from multiple angles, and I loved it. I give Aldnoah.Zero a 9/10\\n\\n\r\n(I was on team Slaine, by the way.)",

            "content": "In this review I discuss mainly the two principal elements for me: characters and plot. I don\u2019t sum up neither of those in relation to the story and I try to focus in the \u201cobjective\u201d elements (i.e: This are the his/her characteristics and this are the things that, in my opinion, makes him/her good/bad). I only recur to spoiler (which are warned before) to back a point. \r\nI.CHARACTERS: This is probably the weakest point.  The show presents some cool characters but then forgets about them and in result they feel kind of shallow or unimportant. I will take a look at the mainthree and then the rest:\\n\\n\r\n- Inaho, The MC: On paper a very interesting character, mainly because in a genre filled with some pretty flawed mc in the decision making department seeing one that is logical and able to remain calm is kind of refreshing. The problem is that if you are going for a character with such levels of stoicism and logical reasoning you have to provide a good backstory that serves as a justification to their actions. Inaho is what, 15 years old? Not more than 16 for sure. So if you have a teen that can come, in clearly disadvantage, with some high-level strategies for military engagements and hardly giving a noticeable fuck about it, you MUST explore the character in a compelling level. Aldnoah.Zero establish a very interesting mc, but it isn\u2019t capable of develop him into a good one. *SPOILER BEGNS* Examples of Inaho being ridiculous are the scene in the shower when he offers the gun to Rayer again and no one even says that it could be a bad idea or when they are planing the assault to the flying castle and is him explaining all the procedure and not any of the other guys with more military experience *SPOILER ENDS*. \\n\\n\r\n- Slaine , Our other MC: Probably not as attractive as Inaho at the start, but surely he does get more development as the show advances. I think he is a pretty solid character because we know what he wants, what are his sentiments and his acts reflects them and enable us to understand him better. Sadly he is overshadowed by Inaho because while the last is capable of change the course and the results of certain actions and thus advance the story, Slaine is pretty much restricted to do something important in one episode but that will not let him advance towards his goals, even if he is now in a different situation. What I\u2019m trying to say is that while it feels that Inaho and the rest of characters move with the plot, Slaine is stalled. So even if he is a fine character he feels pretty unimportant in comparison to the rest, and not only \u201cunimportant to the plot\u201d (which can be ok) but also \u201cunimportant as a character\u201d. Only until the final episode Slaine starts to feel relevant and that, in my opinion, doesn't redeem all of the above.\\n\\n\r\n- Asseylum, The female MC:  She is a nice character. We get to know her but never to a really deep level and, to be honest, while I liked her I didn\u2019t really care for her. While at times she does says some stupid and na\u00efve stuff she is also pretty competent and it does feel relevant.  At the end I think I have to call her a good characters, even if I think that it could be better written and more developed.\\n\\n\r\n- The rest: Welp, here is where I think that the series fails badly. Almost all of the other characters feel irrelevant with a few exceptions (Mainly Crutheo and Saazbaum). The problem is that the show introduce a character that fulfills a particular task and doesn\u2019t do much after that, thus we are packed with characters  that at some point did something kind of relevant but now they are just there to make it feel world  more dynamic and alive that what it seems. For example Inaho classmates at the start of the series are relevant, but then they are set in some role and you don\u2019t get to know or see anything more about them. Yuki is more constant during the show, but we don\u2019t know anything about her besides that she cares about her brother. Marito is in fact more deep that the others, but still you actually can summarize rather briefly what he does during the show: *SPOILER BEGINS* Tries to do something significant but he is struck with a PTSD episode. Then he drinks some alcohol and talks with the doc *SPOILER ENDS*. Darzana is pretty awful to be honest, we know two things about her: She is a Coronel of the United Forces of Earth and *SPOILER BEGINS* her brother died on Heaven\u2019s Fall *SPOILER ENDS*.  Even with the fact that she is almost always the highest in the military hierarchy around she is less relevant than fucking Eddelrittuo. Rayet is ok.  \\n\\n\r\nII.THE PLOT: In think Aldnoah.Zero establish a very appealing world trough the mention of events that have definitely formed what we see and therefore we feel like the world is active. Sadly I think that mention of events doesn\u2019t make it for a good plot. There is in the series a lot of potential because there are so many good elements that can be expanded but never are.  The series could have focused on how the militarization of schools affects the kids, what geopolitical consequences brings the creation of the United Forces of the Earth, the social aspects of Vers and many more. All this themes are mentioned but never truly expanded, and that could have been ok if the actual story that we follow had been stronger. It starts off well, mainly because we can\u2019t judge anything yet and the first impressions we are getting are good\u2026 But before you notice we are met with a series of episodes very formulaic. Now I will admit that the action during those episodes it\u2019s indeed pretty entertaining, but I never felt that the battles supplemented the faults of the plot. \\n\\n\r\nThe other major flaw in the story is that it felts like the only thing actually important is to reach point B from point A: Story and characters are set and nothing really matters until the end. Don\u2019t get me wrong, thing do happen between point A and B but very few have an impact in the plot or characters. It\u2019s like a game where you are introduced with certain elements at the beginning and you know you have to reach the end because that\u2019s what matters. You have check points where something is presented but still doesn\u2019t change the path you are taking towards the final. Of course there is nothing intrinsically wrong with that because the gameplay can be fun as fuck and you don\u2019t really care that much about the plot. You could easily call all of that fun and good but it would probably be harder to call the plot good.  The episodes between the beginning and the end are not necessarily \u201cdead space\u201d because I did have fun at times and some things happened, but I do think that it could have been far more interesting see the characters in deeper perspectives, while building stronger bonds among them or make a commentary on the social aspects of what is happening.\\n\\n\r\nIII.MUSIC AND ANIMATION: We all know that this is the most praised aspect of Aldnoah.Zero and I think that it\u2019s deserved. While I was never blown away by neither of those I was pretty satisfied with it. We rarely get masterpieces and I\u2019m happy with just good and the OST of the series is more than good. The animation is also good but that is all I can say because I\u2019m simply not knowledgeable enough in the matter to make an in-deep analysis. \\n\\n\r\nIV.CONCLUSION: While I think that characters and plot are kind of weak in Aldnoah.Zero I also was pretty entertained in some moments. I was always more expectant than indifferent for the next episode.  The action, music and animation are pretty good and if any of those aspects are important to you, you should definitely watch the series.\\n\\n\r\nDo I recommend Aldonah.Zero to anyone? Yeah, sure.  You don\u2019t need a special taste to like it, mostly because is rather a common series that is closer to the spectrum of good shows. I enjoyed it.\\n\\n\r\nFINAL NOTE: This is my first review so I\u2019m most certain that it has some flaws, also because I\u2019m not a native English speaker. If you have any criticism or advice PLEASE message me, I will more than happy to discuss and hear what you have to tell.\\n",

            "content": "In 1972, the astronauts on the space missions Apollo 17 discovered a hypergate that lead to Mars on the surface of the Moon. Astronauts then discovered a magical, enchanted power, later called \u201cAldnoah\u201d. As \u201cPrincess Asselyum\u201d descends to earth, a war breaks out, and the Martians and Terrans fight to the death. There has been a lot of talk of Aldnoah.Zero in the Summer of 2014, I can definitely see why. Hands-down, the first episode was one of the most attention grabbing first episodes I have ever watched. Unfortunately it all goes downhill from there. This an anime had a bounty of potential but simplyfailed to deliver. \\n\\n\r\nLadies, and Gentlemen a review of Aldnoah.Zero. \\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nThe main premise of the story; how the humans relocated to Mars and then came to Earth to fight was actually very interesting and unique. This premise is actually quite refreshing to see. It also delivered some real-life themes, which many people can relate to. HOWEVER, it is the execution where Aldnoah.Zero failed its great back-story. The execution was down-right terrible, it was filled with many plot holes, and just extremely cringe-worthy things. \\n\\n\r\nFor instance, I find it incomprehensibly stupid every fight scene that doesn\u2019t feature Inaho. It almost seems as if the other pilots cannot control their Kataphrakts. Literally all they would have to do is move, and would of dodged an attack and won. Sorry, If I am missing something, can\u2019t Asselyum power an Aldnoah drive? This is mind I would put getting the Kataphrakt out of the wall top priority. Then, they can now use this and win the war. As well, the time Inaho and Slaine defeated on of the pilots. He shoots him down after he helped him. Why in the fuck would you shoot thisSlaine down? You can question him, learn how the Kataphrakkts work, anything would have been better than shooting him down. I have many more depressing example, but y\u2019know spoilers. \\n\\n\\n\r\n5.5/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nInaho - Inaho is the average super-genius high-schooler. They make this painfully obvious, showing us that the others are just plain stupid and can\u2019t seem to pilot their vehicles. Inaho is basically emotionless. They use this as a scapegoat to push the plot forwards. When his best-friend dies early in the show, he stay emotionally intact and doesn\u2019t show any sign of remorse or regret. I have to say though, I did see at least a little character development with Inaho\u2019s interactions with Asseylum.\\n\\n\r\nSlaine - In my opinion, Slaine was the most interesting character in Aldnoah.Zero. Although at times his motivation were somewhat bland, at least he actually had them. Saying this, Slaine is still a pretty bland character, but at least he isn\u2019t Inaho. \\n\\n\r\n3/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound & Animation\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and sound was probably the saving grace for Aldnoah.Zero. The aesthetics were beautiful. Although the CG\u2019ed mechs sometimes looked a little flawed, If you don\u2019t really mind that (I didn\u2019t) then the art will be something you definitely loved. \\n\\n\r\nThe music was also great. Catchy opening and ending and an OST that really captured the scenes in the show. (Dat explosion scene music tho). Not really much flaws to say about the sound, it was just generally well done\u201d. \\n\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nI didn\u2019t particularly enjoy like other show I was watching at the time (Gekkan Shouju Nozaki-kun, Zankyou no Terror, Tokyo Ghoul), but maybe it is because I enjoyed these shows so much it dulled in comparison. Even with all these flaws I still had the need to go back and watch this anime every week. I can\u2019t lie, there were really, legitimate moments of hype and I still enjoyed this show, but was dulled in comparison. \\n\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\\n\r\nAldnoah.Zero was a fun, mecha adventure. It had one of the best first episodes I have ever watched, but then went downhill. This show has amazing sound/music and graphics, but failed to execute the on the story and character. I would say Aldnoah.Zero is an anime you should watch without thinking, if you think to much you will just ask yourselves questions after every episode. Just feel it, don\u2019t watch it. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL 5.625/10\\n\\n\r\n-Choco\\n\\n",

            "content": "If you're looking for a show with heartstring wrenching character development, this is probably not where you want to end up, but if you like giant robot action that's a different category from the likes of Gundam, then you will enjoy this show.\r\nI've been a fan of the Gundam series for many years and while Gundam as a whole focuses more on the emotive side of war and politics, the overarching theme is that usually the protagonists side possesses strong machinery more than the opposing side, that or both have equal power.\r\nWhat fascinated me most about Aldnoah.Zero is that the Terran side has literally inferiorfirepower (and the first 5 minutes of the pilot make this very clear) compared to the Martian side. But each battle is fought with strategy and ad hoc calculation, something I found lacking in Gundam, where battles essentially boil down to either who is the better pilot or some macro-strategy executed by the battleship. On the other hand, the battleship plays more of a comms role in Aldnoah Zero, relaying between combatant units than frequently engaging its own artillery.\\n\\n\r\nThe mech designs are all unique, aside from Terran technology, which just comprises of two unique models, each Martian unit is distinct with its own unique set of skills. You'll notices that in Gundam each unit either falls into one of two categories: a samurai styled unit with a helmet shaped head, a V-fin and skirt armour, or a ZAKU-style unit (which the GOUF is a part of too), a mono-eye, tubing and heavy armour plates. In Aldnoah.Zero, an enemy unit can look like a bat, a gull, a beetle etc. in general shape, which is what did it for me. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is generic, lacking and raised a lot more questions than it actually answered, but hey, the artwork and soundtrack make it clear that it's main goal is riveting battle scenes, animated in seamless 2D-3D meshes.\\n\\n\r\nThe main thing to look at here is that if you are trying to compare this to Gundam, in general terms, Gundam is going to win almost every time, but looking at this in its own unique traits is what makes this show truly stand apart from other mecha sci-fi anime.",

I see people ripping this anime a new one, and one i saw tore apart this meaning. I don't care about what they think though. Let me tell you what i believe it means.\r\nThis anime has a terrible and overwhelming sense of justice. Justice is a term that can be displayed and used and ones own way.  The justice this anime provides is \"You ruin this land you call Earth so we will take it from you by force\" Forget the false start thisanime gets, in the first episode where what you think is true is a lie.\\n\\n\r\nIf one believes they are righteous in there views, that is there justice.\\n\\n\r\nLook at the second part of this saying 'Though the heavens fall'. This would suggest ones downfall. Your justice will cause great and overwhelming despair. Thus the fall from paradise. \\n\\n\r\nOkay with that out of the way lets move on to the other ratings.\\n\\n\r\nI said i see people telling you how terrible this anime is, and i'm not going to tell you its the best anime. Not even i believe that. I do find faults with this anime, lots of them. However, i genuinely enjoyed this anime a lot.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nIt was a good idea. I just don't think it was executed correctly. There were so many flaws and a lot of it left you guessing.      A war breaks out, but the one who wanted peace is the one who causes it. I just thought in the begging what triggered this war was way to simple.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art and animation were gorgeous. You can fault this anime all you want for terrible story or plot, but you can't tell me this anime is ugly. The people,fight scenes, earth and space all drawn amazingly.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nAnother thing you can't argue about. The opening is amazing, the music played for fight scenes or when something dramatic happens is so epic and fits whatever is going on perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nWhich for more don't have a lot of development, but isn't a fair enough reason for me to hate any of them.\\n\r\nPrincess Asseylum is my favorite character and probably the best character in this anime.\\n\r\nKaizuka Inaho, whom I wasn't so sure about in the begging, is a bit to robotic and shows almost no emotion. He grows on you though, after you watch him save people, and come up with brilliant plans.\\n\r\n Slaine Troyad, had making of best character in this anime till he couldn't be bothered to have one singular plan or thought and stick to it. Sure he wants to protect the Princess and does it the best way he can, but when people start telling you there evil plans, YOU DO NOT SAVE THEM.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nIt kept me on the edge of my seat at least. I really wanted to see how it ended. Seeing what Inaho would do next to protect everyone was also a doosy. I also was excited to see what Princess Asseylum would do. I was hoping she'd show off some crazy powers, and i guess in a way she did.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nEven though there were some places it was hella inconsistent at, and i wanted to get to know alot of the characters more, i still really liked it. The ending left it on one major cliff hanger so i'm super omega thrilled to start the 2nd season.\\n",

            "content": "I'm looking at the Staff list right now and are you sure Gen Urobuchi was the creator of the show? Because it doesn't feel like his work that I've come to know and love. Except the ending, I can definitely tell that was his work. \r\n[Story]: (7.5/10)\r\nIn the year 1972, the Apollo 17 Astronauts found a hypergate on the Moon that allowed the humans to teleport to Mars. Those who chose to settle in Mars became a race known as \"VERS\" and those chose to stay on Earth were known as \"Terrans\". The VERS Empire discovered a technology far more advanced than Earth known as\"Aldnoah\" drive. The VERS Empire then declared war against Earth but due to the \"Heaven's Fall\", the two sides established a ceasefire. \\n\\n\r\nAldnoah Zero's premise reminds me so much of the First World War and if you've taken and studied History before then you'd know exactly the similarities between A/Z's cause of war and the cause of WW1. If you don't know your History then Im'a tell you the similarities. WW1 was caused by a successful assassination attempt on Archduke Ferdinand and the war between the VERS Empire and the Terrans was caused by an assassination attempt on the Princess of VERS which re-ignited the war between the two similar yet different races. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of races, the reason why I avoided Aldnoah.Zero at first is I thought this show was going to be aliens that literally looks like aliens vs the human race which I have seen a million times before. What's makes Aldnoah.Zero unique though, compared to other \"Aliens vs Human Races\" type of shows/movies out there, is these two races are literally the same. It's just that something happened in the past that caused the human race to split apart into two and I love what they did here. We humans are greedy as f*ck and we can't get along with each other so I wouldn't be surprised if a situation like this happens in the far future. \\n\\n\r\nContinuing on from my 1st paragraph (not counting the synopsis), the anime immediately showed us that the VERS Empire are the bad guys and Terrans are not. It may look like the Terrans attempted an assassination to the Princess of VERS but they didn't. The twist here is that the VERS Empire actually tried to assassinate their own princess just so they can have an excuse to declare another war against Earth. Oh man! I am already loving the story so why didn't I give this show a high score? \\n\\n\r\nThe thing about Aldnoah.Zero's plot is it started super strong and it had the potential to become one of my favourite anime war drama of all time. Except it didn't because it barely focused on the supposed \"horrors of war\" and it didn't really focus on the global war invasion around the country or around the world. The show also didn't do a good job on its world-building. Instead, the show focused too much on a small group lead by an overpowered protagonist who can somehow take down an army of \"Technologically-Advanced\" Martians. I only get to see the war on the group's persepective most of the time. Focusing on a small group without focusing too much on the global conflict would have probably worked out too but the show failed on that too. By focusing on a small group, I expected an amazing character development from the protagonist or any other characters in the group but that didn\u2019t happen. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the good parts about the show is the mecha fights. I.Freaking.Love.The.Mecha.Fights. Mechas in this show are purely used as a ground-based conventional weapons and that's it. They acted like how a ground-based weapon should act. What I hate about the mecha genre is how the mechas breaks the laws of physics. There's no way a giant and a heavy ass mecha can fly in three-dimensions which makes mechas looks childish and ridiculous. You could argue that the Kataphrakts were flying in a few scenes....Yea, they weren't flying. They were levitating off the ground to give them a boost or in other words, they had \"Thrust Packs\". There's a difference.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending......what do I have to say about the ending...It's shocking, I gotta give them that but not in a good way. Oh Gen, what is it with you and your shocking elements. I just want to ignore the events that occurred in the ending and all the BS things that continued to occur in the 2nd Season. Though, I won't talk about the 2nd Season here because I'm making a separate review for that one. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]: (9/10)\\n\r\nSo who did the Art, Animation and the Character Designs? Was it purely A-1 Pictures or did they get some help from TROYCA? Honestly, I'm not sure because all I know is that TROYCA definitely did the mecha designs and the Art/Character Designs does not look like your typical A-1 Picture's bland design. Meh, who cares? The Art looks amazing, the character designs are superb and the animation is super consistent. The mecha designs aren't the greatest but they're not that bad either. It's pretty average. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Sound]: (9/10)\\n\r\nYou gotta give props to the show's sound department for producing one of the most amazing soundtrack I've ever heard in a mecha anime and a bunch of goosebump-inducing insert songs. Now the OP and ED theme song(s)\\n\\n\r\nThe OP theme song is \"heavenly blue\" by Kalafina. It's by Kalafina, nuff' said. It sounds somewhat similar to Fate/Zero OP 2 but I don't care because it still sounds epic. \\n\r\nThe ED theme songs are  \"A/Z\" by SawanoHiroyuki[nZk]:mizuki and \"aLIEz\" by SawanoHiroyuki[nZk]:mizuki. Ahh, the only ED that I love in the series. I really love the singer's voice and the song sounds really good. I love the drumbeats in the background and the chorus is amazing.\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Characters]: (6/10)\\n\r\nThe characters is what definitely killed the show, especially the main protagonist of the series Inaho Kaizuka. \\n\\n\r\nInaho isn't the worst character I've ever seen, per say but he's definitely a bad character who barely gets any character development. What makes him a bad character though? Is it because he's a smart tactician like Lelouch from Code Geass? Nope. It's because he's too boring. He doesn't talk a lot, he speaks in a monotonic tone, and he doesn't have any personality. Dude, I'd rather see Inko (who is a supporting character) get more screentime than Inaho. Wait a minute.... I want a supporting character to get more screentime than the main protagonist? That should tell you something. Personally, I would rather see him as a supporting character because having a silent protagonist who can kick anybody's ass is so cliche. I mean, I've seen those protagonist types a lot of times before. There's also the fact that he's an underdeveloped main character who doesn't get any better through out the season. In fact, he gets worse in the 2nd Season but I'm going to leave that for my 2nd Season review. \\n\\n\r\nSlaine Troyard is probably the only interesting character in the series. Slaine is a Terran who crash landed on Mars with his father only to become one of the people of the VERS Empire. He befriended the Princess and became very loyal to the princess despite being poorly treated by other Martians because he's an outsider. Once he learned that the Terrans assassinated the Princess, he then did whatever any loyal person would do if the person that they're serving under comes under attack. He switched sides and started helping the Terrans. The fact that he's doing everything in his power to expose the truth behind the assassination attempt is what makes me like his character. Plus it's kind of a revenge for him because they have been treating him like sh*t just because he's not truly a Martian. Too bad this will be the last time I see Slaine being a bad-ass character. \\n\\n\r\nI actually liked some of the supporting characters like Inko (Inaho's childhood friend) and Rayet but the truth is, some -- if not -- most of the supporting characters are also underdeveloped. So far, they're just there because the show demands it and I barely know anything about their past. Except for one of the supporting characters named Lieutenant Koichiro Marito. His PTSD and how he got it was actually explored and touched upon. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]: (8/10)\\n\r\nDespite the show having a boring-ass main protagonist, I still enjoyed the show because of the action scenes which are so freaking great. I don't watch a lot of mechas. In fact, I avoid them like a plague and that's probably the reason why I enjoyed Aldnoah.Zero. It's because the show didn't focus too much on the mechas. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[VERDICT] \\n\r\nAldnoah.Zero started out so great and it had the potential to become one of the greatest war drama anime ever but sadly, that wasn't the case. The story just didn't meet my expectations and the characters (with the exception of Slaine, Rayet and a couple of supporting characters) were unlikable, especially the protagonist. The show does have great action scenes and I'm glad they didn't focus too much on the mechas, which allowed mecha haters like me to easily digest this show. \\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL]: (7.5/10)\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+Awesome Action Scenes\\n\r\n+The show didn't focus on the mechas\\n\r\n+Great Visuals and Animation\\n\r\n+Amazing Soundtrack\\n\r\n+Great OP and ED theme songs\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Underwhelming Story\\n\r\n-Most of the characters are Underdeveloped\\n\r\n-Unlikable Protagonist\\n\r\n-Shocking Ending just for the sake of Shock purposes\\n",

            "content": "So I'm writing this review with the knowledge that there is a season 2 coming up. It kinda inflates the scores a bit because I have hope that season 2 will make up for the short comings of season 1. \r\nAll in all, this was a good anime. It's engaging and draws you in, especially if you are a fan that prefers fight scenes over story. I recommend this anime, despite the questionable ending (once again with the assumption season 2 will pick up where this left off). If I could summarize this anime in a short sentence, \"a 'kai' version of Gundam Seed\". \r\nStory- 7\\n\\n\r\nGood enough for me. The plus point of this series for me was the short 12 episode length. Everything was to the point, no needless flashbacks or back story explanations. We were given the bare basics of what we needed to know. Unlike others, I don't think this anime was trying to be more 'profound'. It's super clear when an anime wants to do that because they go overboard, and Aldnoah did not. It was laser focused on battle which I think goes hand in hand to the goal of this anime clearly outlined in the beginning. \\n\\n\r\nThe story fell under to the battle scenes, but I was okay with that. It wasn't like the story was subpar, just brief and negligible when you've watch a 1001 animes with discrimination, war, hatred and needless suffering. You've seen it once, and you don't need to see it again. That's why I rated the story as high as I did. It glances and nods to the suffering aspect of war, but remains hyper focused on the here and now adrenaline of battle. \\n\\n\r\nThat said, the ending keeps it from being higher. It's not even the 'events' that take place. It's the aftermath - we are quite literally left with a blackout scene of the major battle with the narrator describing who won. Nothing is said about what happens to the rest of the crew/friends. It was needlessly abrupt so as to keep fans on a high climax to draw us in for the second season. But I really didn't like that, especially all that happened between the characters. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 10\\n\\n\r\nIt's a newer anime and it shows. Everything was amazing, the battle scenes fantastic. Another plus point for me was that the characters were anime-ized (colored hair, eyes) but nothing extravagant or unrealistic. When there is a blond/blue eyed character they mention that they might be European/Slavic etc. making this more 'real' for me. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 8\\n\\n\r\nGood music, enough to get you drawn in and pumped for the battle scene. But it gets a bit repetitive. I noticed there wasn't a lot of 'desperation' music - the sounds of when a character is sad or gets betrayed. The soundtrack was almost always only for battle. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 6\\n\\n\r\nIt's a short anime, and it's not focused on character development. Who you see in the beginning is who you get. Which I appreciated a lot. We have all sorts of characters here, and in that way it's nice we don't follow one person the entire time. \\n\\n\r\nInaho - I liked him. He is what I look for in anime characters - the smart protagonist that outwits his opponent. He is dull, not hyper active like traditional male protagonists but I was okay with that. We don't follow him all the time, so he doesn't get boring for me. He's an unexpected main character with more 'wisdom' than what we expect making him seem older but that wasn't a drawback for me. \\n\\n\r\nSeylum - she reminds me a lot of Lacus (from GS) but a better version. I didn't hate her or find her whiny . While Aldnoah didn't focus on character development there was a bit of it with her - we saw her grow and realize what it takes to get to her dream but still have enough hope she can see it through. I rooted for her and sympathized for her. \\n\\n\r\nSlaine - he is the reason I rate the characters so low. I honestly had no clue what Slaine's purpose in this anime was. Honestly, it seems like he was there only to get beaten, anticlimatically be snubbed down, and be at the wrong place at the wrong time. The only time he shows a slight bit of character independence and emotion - and that's saying something considering the emotionless Inaho - is at the end. I can't even hate Slaine because I just couldn't get a feel for his character. He wasn't even mysterious, more like that annoying dead pixel that sits on the centre of your screen. You have no idea when it got there and how to fix it without throwing the entire monitor away. \\n\\n\r\nSecondary characters - they are what made this anime. We have Marito, Yuki, Inko, Calm, and the Oribtal knights. They give the anime dimension through their various personalities. Even the villains are people that really get under your skin. In some aspects the secondary characters completely outshine the main characters. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall - 8\\n\\n\r\nIt was a good anime, with the exception of the ending. If I didn't know there was a season 2 planned, I would lower this score. The ending cuts off any enjoyment you might really feel, literally. Hopefully season 2 will pick up meaningfully what was left of season 1. \\n\\n\r\nOther stuff I like -  I personally really like that Inaho could hold off superior technology with his brilliance, that he was almost always guaranteed to win. The battles were great, the in between enough to make me keep going. It's a short anime but it's jam packed with action, drive and purpose. There is always something going on in each episode and with how many characters there are of importance, the plot seamed together really nicely. \\n\\n\r\nI recommend this anime to those fans that prefer good battle scenes over story, even if the battles are often short. I can honestly say I am looking forward to season 2 and whatever it may bring.",

            "content": "*Spoiler Free... almost... minor point made in explaining my position on the ending of the series but nothing specific is given away*\r\n I'm not going to bore anyone with long expositions and fancy tropes in order to make people read my review. I'm just going to give a short but concise review of this show where I express my reasons for rating it as such. I was never aware of this anime when it first aired so I my review will not be influenced like those others that seem to have been let down by the supposed \"hype train.\" \r\nStory: 7/10 \r\nNothing original here, ifyou want a short synopsis read it in the information section of the anime. While the story was unoriginal it was presented in such a way that I found it interesting enough to continue watching. Overall I thought the story engaging and interesting all the way through until the last five minutes of the series; more on that later.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is where Aldnoah Zero really shines I think. While not groundbreaking I thought the art was fantastic, and fit in really well with the style of the anime itself. Others may disagree but this is my review so... :P\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\\n\r\nNothing to exciting in the OST for this anime but the use of music and increasing the volume for it at specific tense moments was quite amusing and put a little extra zing in those emotional scenes. Well done and well executed. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately this is what gets the lowest score here, not saying the characters weren't engaging and deep enough for this short anime series but they are basically characters seen dozens of times before in these sorts of anime. Classic example being the Lelouch Vi Britannia (Code Geass, an anime that should be on everyone's must watch list before you die) wanna be as the main character. Not terrible characters; overally good enough to drive the plot but as stated earlier, nothing original here. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nHere it is folks, the category that matters most when reviewing anime and that's my own personal enjoyment. I actually would have rated Aldnoah Zero higher on my enjoyment scale around a 8/10 because of the artwork and pacing but that ending though... it ruined the entire anime for me. All that excellent work ruined by poor execution in the last 5 minutes of the series. It seemed like they wanted to fit too much into the last episode and thus had to cram the ending in as an afterthought. If you can't tell I'm a firm believer that a terrible ending to a series can completely ruin how a series is ranked for me. I'm not disappointed because of the direction they chose to go in in ending the series but rather on how it was presented. Bam! This major plot point happens...and...cut to a short 10 second explanation then BOOM! over... credits... thanks guys... I'm so glad I invested a little under 5 hours in watching your series for this train wreck of an ending. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nI've never let a show's \"hype\" affect how I perceive a show, I base everything on how the story, characters, sound, and art make me feel while I watch it. Honestly if it hadn't been for that ending I would have ranked Aldnoah Zero much higher. While not original in the slightest I found the pacing, artwork, and sound to be mixed well with a set of mediocre characters that actually made for an enjoyable mecha/military anime... until that ending. \\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this to a friend... sure... if he was bored and had nothing else to watch. I'd definitely let him/her know before that the ending stinks though.",

            "content": "There's nothing that appeals me more than a good science-fiction space opera. The inter-galactic war is a classic and the many other elements add some spice as well. \r\nAldnoah zero is set up in an alternative present (yes, \"present\", because everything happens in 2014) where humans are in a historic conflict with Mars. And who else could be better to stop this, than Mars' princess herself. \r\nAnd here we have a dramatic and fast-paced sequence of events that lead us to the final trigger to the war declaration from Mars towards the Earth. All of this in the first episode. It is a truly hookingstart, and it never ceases to amuse. The rest of the episodes don't dissapoint either.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\\n\r\nGiven the context, I was really intrigued by the fact that the plot progression is not focused on the characters, but the war itself. And it really fits in such a realistic and human way. Trust and betrayal are back and forth, and all the events give you kind of a dark feel to the series.\\n\\n\r\nAnother notable aspect is the \"neutral\" side that the series take. The different points of view never try to root for one character in particular nor one side either. There's this original feel that releases you from the \"good vs evil\" thing and many times our characters are put to the test when it comes to their morals vs survival. The reasons every single one of them are fighting are also well taken care of.\\n\\n\r\nI am warning you right now (spoiler) that the season leaves many questions unanswered, and it is practically a door-opener to a much larger universe, creating space for more ideas and progression. This was just the tip of the iceberg. And last, but not least, it is a tragedy.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is simply spectacular in all of its aspects. Everything is well detailed and executed with an amazing precision and beauty. It is one of these few animes that pretty much are worth it to watch in HD.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\\n\r\nHere's the part where I say that I usually skip Openings and Engins. And I did skip the ending lol, but the Opening was just amazing. It pumps you with an enormous hype right from the beggining, and gives you this \"Come on, get up and fight\" feel. \\n\\n\r\nThe background music is truly amazing as well, and it reminded me a lot of Shingeky no Kyojin's music. Every event shown is just completely perfect with the music, and never fails to complement the animation and visual style.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound design was also a score. It reminded me a lot to Starcraft, which is a well crafted sound design.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\\n\r\nFrom the beginning, you can tell this anime is not character-driven. It is not supposed to achieve a great development and the interactions between them are concise at \"best\". However, the pace of the development for each one was really on spot and was never forced. Most of the characters are not what you see on every anime and what appealed to me the most, was the decisions that people took out of fear, desperation, or even traumas and personal morals. Vengeance, betrayal and promises are broken when you least expect it, and you really can't tell if you deeply know at least one of these character. Of course, we are at war, everything can happen.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\\n\r\nAlthough I don't really enjoy Mecha anime's that much, I found Aldnoah Zero to be an outstanding experience from the beginning. It has everything you could ask for if you are looking for an action-packed experience, as well as good technical execution and an unexpected end.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\\n\r\nGiven that the final was not a \"final\", we have many questions unanswered, but this adds up a lot of spice when it comes to intriguing and suspenseful story-telling. You should definitely give it a try. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review, and don't hesitate to give some feedback if you have something to say about it :D",

            "content": "This will be my very first 'formal' anime review.  So sorry if it may sound 'unprofessional' but I will get used to it LOL.\r\nThis will be my format:\r\nStory - 10/10\r\nJust read the summary of the series for you to know a glimpse of what you will see in this series.  And though it sounds a little bit cliche at first, or your typical story about Earth vs Mars, YOU'RE WRONG.  The series tackles about science, politics, and war, mostly science.  I'm taking a physics course for my college degree so I get a lot of what the characters are saying whenthey are analyzing the abilities of their opponent mechs, but I'm not saying you need to be one for you to understand the series LOL.  Also I'm promising you will get hooked at the series at the end of episode 3, doing the 'Madoka Magica' style, (hope you get the reference).  The reason for the 10/10 score is because the series took the cliche Earth vs Mars story into another level.  And it's either you will like it or not, as for me I liked it a lot.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9/10\\n\r\nI'm not really that of an expert when it comes to judging animations, but I can say that incorporating CGI in the mech battles is quite awesome.  I can really tell the difference  in the advancements in animation these days compared other mech series like Code Geass and Gundam Wing.  Art style is also flawless, it's very colorful and well-detailed, it makes you understand the physics aspects of the series.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9/10\\n\r\nI'm always a big fan of Japanese music.  Also, I have my own preference in music.  To be honest I was not a big fan of the opening song, but the two ending songs, I like it a lot.  But what makes me grade this a 9/10 is because of the insert songs.  Throughout the whole series there is an insert song at least every episode, especially when a mech battle is going on.  I was a big fan of the songs 'Breathless' and 'Keep on keeping on',  as far as I can remember, they were played at episode 12 and episode 7, respectively.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 8/10\\n\r\nThe characters may have been he downside of the series.  The main character of the Earthlings(or Terrans as what they are referred by the Martians), Inaho, is a very smart but emotionless person. So emotionless that his sister says that 'he is on cloud 9' when his face is blank. LOL.  But his brains is something that I envy a lot because he can determine the physics behind his opponents' mechs.  Since it is portrayed in the series that the Martians are more advanced technologically than the Terrans putting them in a very big disadvantage in terms of warfare.  As for Inaho, he is using this disadvantage to analyze his opponent mechs abilites to take them down.  The main character in the side of the Martians , Slaine, is originally a Terran but working as a low ranking Martian for a reason.  Slaine gets more of the development than Inaho in the entire series making the more likeable character.  As for the supporting characters, Princess Asseylum and Rayet who are both Martians also get a good development, but some characters such as Lt.Marito has been a downside.  I just hope that he will get the full development in season 2.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment -10/10\\n\r\nI may sound bias here but this series is my personal pick for best anime of 2014.  Yes best of 2014, meaning it's better than the likes of Tokyo Ghoul, Nanatsu no Taizai, etc. ( I have not seen Parasyte, Shingeki no Bahamut, No Game no Life and Zankyou no Terror)  My personal enjoyment for this series is a perfect 10/10 because the series has been great in leaving cliffhangers almost every episode.  Especially episode 3 and the final episode which I can say the most mindf*cked season ender I've seen in a while.  The ending is very comparable to the ending of Code Geass season 1.  And in my opinion, Aldnoah Zero pulled it better than Code Geass, again my own opinion. Also the analyzing skills of Inaho is very enjoyable throughout the series, it entertains me because what he is saying are actually my lessons in physics at college, LOL. You will also enjoy listening to the insert songs in the action scenes, that sometime you may lose concentration on the scenes because of the music, hahaha. Overall, I enjoyed the series a lot, and I hope that season 2 will be a lot better.",

            "content": "Aldnoah.Zero spoiler free. collective score for both seasons. \r\nI think mecha fans are a bit too picky about this. \r\nIn 1972, the Apollo 17 mission found a hypergate to Mars on the surface of the moon. Upon landing, astronauts discovered an enchanted utility later referred to as \"Aldnoah,\" giving the astronauts a status of superiority. Soon, many humans have relocated to Mars, and have adapted to the name \"Martians.\" After Princess Asseylum, a royal Martian princess, descends onto Earth in an attempt to create a treaty between both planets, a war breaks out between Earth and Mars, and Martian soldiers begin to descend from thesky, riding steel giants, intent on exterminating humanity.\\n\\n\r\nI love the smooth consistent art and animation. Even the CGI mechs are great. The story hits the ground running and keeps the action and suspense up with excellent directing. Leaving each episode with anticipation for the next. Scenario writing is a bit poor, but the story is pretty decent imo. Besides the war between Earth and Mars, you're also dealing with characters own self-loathing, deceit and betrayal among your own military, and a love triangle on two fronts. The situation awareness and battles are pretty contrived and forced, but entertaining none the least. Although it often becomes inconceivable how the allies and the enemies handle the situation in combat. They merely stand there almost willingly to be cannon fodder. I find story development and character interactions to be the meat of the show. The supporting cast on the Terran (Earth) crew don't play a large role in the story, but have enough screen time to make them likable and keep things from becoming stale with small stories inbetween events. The Martian side of things is where the juice comes from. The second season especially gets good with it's character development. The major turns in plot direction are what appeal to me. Like the jealous romance and the betrayal of trust to accomplish selfish goals. Not the mundane details. This show has problems, but seriously gets hated on hard for the dumbest things. (With that said, Kappa)\\n\\n\r\nRant time.\\n\r\nLet's talk about our MC and \"hero\" Kirito-I mean Inaho, Mr. \"Deus ex Machina\" himself. Completely stoic, with zero personality (that's a pantsu dropper of course). A high schooler at this military academy with top honors in his studies and training. A genius if you will. When war breaks out, he is the only person smart enough to decipher the enemies technology that the humans have never seen, think of strategies on the fly to combat these enemies, and can out maneuver experienced pilots in a trainer, not even a military issue kataphrakt and is quickly recognized as only person who can defeat the greatest threat that humanity has faced. And we're just supposed to accept this? .... sure.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other side of the spectrum, we have Slaine \"muthafuckin\" Troyard. The true star of this show. Slaine is a low ranking crew member of the Martian Landing Castle when war breaks out. He appears caring, feeble, and passive. But after an unexpected event, he gains a resolve stronger than any Aldnoah Drive. And starts on a long personal vendetta even when all odds are against him, to climb the ranks, take control of the local force, and start a campaign to achieve his desire. Strong willed, intelligent, passionate, and courageous (*starts to tear up), Slaine will stop at nothing, until his goals are met. (You could compare his resolve with Caius Ballad from Final Fantasy XIII-2. Sure Caius got a little carried away with his motives and his ideas became twisted, but you couldn't help but feel sympathy for the man. After all, he wanted to do the only thing he thought he could to save the one person he loved above all else. That's exactly how I feel about Slaine!)\\n\\n\r\nThe conflict involving both characters are cliche but still rather interesting.\\n\r\nI liked it, for the most part. The soundtrack was pretty decent. The ending kinda came without much closure, but the journey getting there was fun.",

            "content": "Watching a certain show last year opened my eyes in a lot of things. One of them is probably what the real reason behind every war is. Not only fictional, but in reality as well. Greed. Let\u2019s face it, no one admits it but it\u2019s the truth. The government says it\u2019s for freedom, for integrity, and for pride, is that really the truth? An interesting conspiracy theory once said that America itself was responsible for 9-11. It said that 9-11 was just an excuse made by America so that they can go to war in the Middle East. But why would America do this? Weall know that the Middle East is rich in oil. Isn\u2019t that reason in it of itself? To this day, a titan-like country like China is still in dispute with a microscopic nation in the Philippines because of some small island. Is it just a simple territory dispute? No. That island is packed with resources. In the now, a group called ISIS/ISIL butchering men from other countries because they didn\u2019t join forces with them. Why do they need countries to join forces with them? Simple. Their military ranks will grow then it\u2019ll be a walk in the park to conquer other countries. Greed. Even if I\u2019m an atheist, I think I understand why it\u2019s one of the mortal sins. \\n\r\n\tAnyway, I\u2019m not here today to talk about politics and world disputes. I\u2019m not into that shit. What I\u2019ll talk about is a show about war and greed. As you may already know, this is a review about Aldnoah.Zero. This is a review of the first 16 episode of the series because mainly, at the time of this review, season 2 is still airing. Please be warned that this review might contain some spoiler for both seasons. So, yeah, LET JUSTICE BE DONE!\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\n\tBeing a war-flick freak that I am, this series was just pure gravy to me. It tells the beautiful story that every nation (or in this case, planet) always have hidden desires every time they start a war against another country. It\u2019s not just about pride, not just about freedom, not just about integrity, not just for revenge. Every war always starts with a hidden desire in both sides, no exception. The focus of the series might be not that globally (or galactic in case of season 2) but the entire war is still there (as seen on episode 2) and a little imagination isn\u2019t really that bad, right? \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\n\tIf there\u2019s a problem in this, it could be the characters; specially the main ones. They are a bit too 1D if compared to the rest of the cast. I might as well talk about the 3 to make this section longer. \\n\r\n Firstly, we have PRINCESS ASSEYLUM VERS ALLYUSIA!! (Sorry. I feel like that was necessary) who is the token \u201cMy existence alone can stop the war\u201d character. Throughout the series, most of her appearance showed her talking, walking, and dying (twice) and nothing else. It was like her reason for existence (at least in season 1) was to make contact with the Martians in order to stop the war (Guess how effective that was) and nothing else. She spends almost the entire series doing nothing. She was just deadweight in Deucalion. However, one might argue that without her, the Deucalion wouldn\u2019t even move. Fine, I\u2019ll give her that at the very least. But apart from that, what other use can she give? Nothing except die every 3 episodes. Her character is as useless as Orihime and Sakura. Shots fired! *insert reloading and firing shot here*\\n\\n\r\nThe second character I\u2019d like to talk about is Char Aznable. The Red Comet. The Prince of Zeon. Sieg Zeon! Oh wait a minute. This isn\u2019t a Gundam review! Let\u2019s get this right. Slaine Troyard, the 2nd coming of Char Aznable (Sorry Full Frontal). Many people say that Aldnoah.Zero is like Gundam. I, for one kinda agree with them. One of the many reason I say this is the obvious comparison between Char and Slaine. Both of them are blonde, they both wear red (Spoiler for Aldnoah.Zero 2), both are anti-heroes, and both joined the enemy to destroy it from the inside. If Slaine paints the Tharsis red, put a scar in his forehead, then wear a mask, he will become Char. In regards to his character, he is probably the most interesting character in the series. This might be an overstatement in season 1, but in season 2, his character developed and he is now the torchbearer of the show. He\u2019s my favorite character in the series just like how Char is my favorite character in the Gundam U.C. timeline.\\n\\n\r\nTo wrap things up in this section, I would like to talk about the obvious. Godnaho. If Gen continued writing the series, I bet his character would have been my favorite. He, like most Gen Urobutchi protagonists (Ein from Phantom, Ledo from Gargantia, Homura from Homura Magika, and Kiritsugu Emiya from Fate/Zero to an extent), gives off a distant/emotionless aura. But throughout the series, these characters developed and somehow captured my kokoro and they immediately became my favorites in their respective series. Inaho, however, after 16 episodes, stayed the same as he was in episode 1: A fucking rock. Emotionless and cold. No explanation on how he became like this, and I doubt we will ever see him change.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\\n\r\n\tThe animation for this show was done by the ever popular A-1 Pictures (Sword Art Online, Black Butler, Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso) and a rather up-and-coming studio in TROYCA. I don\u2019t know if they divided the work between 2D and CG, but my guess is that A-1 is doing the 2D while TROYCA is doing the CG. If that\u2019s the case, then A-1 seems to be doing well like they always did. However, TROYCA\u2019s CG in season 1 was just, uhhhm\u2026 Crap. I\u2019ve seen bad CG before but this was just another level. Look at the time when Inaho\u2019s friend got killed in the 2nd episode then tell me if it\u2019s a good combination between 2D and CG animation. If you say yes, I will gladly slap you on the spot. Gonzo would\u2019ve done a better job (*insert \u201cThis is Bait\u201d pic here*). HOWEVER! In season 2, they did their homework. I bet they looked at threads and realize that fans hate their CG and made it better. Compare the scene where Inaho\u2019s friend died in episode 2 side by side to episode 15 where Tharsis and the orange Kataphrakt does battle for the first time; there\u2019s absolutely no contest. I\u2019m really happy in that huge jump in CG animation between the 2 seasons.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\n\tMy main problem in the composer, Hiroyuki Sawano, is that he tends to not compose much which leaves the director repeating the same music over and over again (Good example are Shingeki no Kyojin\u2019s Attack on Titan OST, and Kill la Kill\u2019s Before My Body is Dry which was used almost every episode). In 2 seasons, only 3 songs left a good impression to me: aLIEz (I said cry. 2nd ED), Bre@th//ess (Inaho\u2019s theme), and No Difference (Slaine\u2019s theme). There\u2019s also that 1 music which I don\u2019t know the title of. It was used just once throughout the entire series. It was at episode 2 during the 1st attack of the Orbital Knights. That music was really good but in 16 episodes, that song has only been used once which is really disappointing. Some situational OST\u2019s was also used well, but I prefer the ones with the lyrics when it comes to Sawano\u2019 compositions. I really like Sawano (more than Kajiura and Kanno) but I just wish he present the viewers with a wider variety because his compositions are just really good. Well, at least in my eyes, errr\u2026 I mean ears.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict:\\n\\n\r\n\tFirst, let me apologize at pointing my fingers at the countries/groups mentioned in the introduction. If you belong to the aforementioned countries/groups, then I sincerely apologize. I was just trying to make a point. So, yeah, I\u2019m sorry. Anyway, onto the verdict!\\n\\n\r\n\tNow, after pulling random numbers out of my ass and dropping it to Earth while mizuki sings aLIEz (8.1 for story, 6.8 for characters, 7.4 for animation, 8.7 for sound, and 8.8 for overall enjoyment), I present Aldnoah.Zero with an overall score of 7.96. Even if you haven\u2019t seen any mecha, you will surely like this series because of the action and story that it presents. It portrays a realistic view in war while also inserting a sci-fi twist which only makes it much more interesting. The characters and animations are a bit disappointing at first but it will be sure to grow on you as the series progress.\\n\\n\r\nAlternate Anime Recommendation:\\n\\n\r\n\tIf you liked Aldnoah.Zero, why don\u2019t you try Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn? Both series is about war between Earthlings and Spacenoids because of their personal desires (Greed in Aldnoah, Hatred in Unicorn). Both series also has princess characters (if you grew up to Disney and have a princess complex, then this is gold for you) which fights against their respective factions.\\n\\n\r\n\tIf you don\u2019t like Gundam, Code Geass is still available. Though not the galactic scale, Code Geass still focuses on war between Japan and Britania. Though unlike Aldnoah.Zero, the mechs in Code Geass doesn\u2019t have supernatural abilities. The pilots in Code Geass possess that ability. \\n\\n\r\n\tAnd yeah, that\u2019s it for me. Thanks for reading. Bye!\\n",

            "content": "To give a simplified plot summary of the show it can be shortened down to the story of two different factions of humans fighting each other, one for survival (the inhabitants of earth), and the other in order to claim ownership of earth and its resources (Vers empire). The Vers Empire being humans who colonized Mars and consider themselves to be of a superior race.\r\nOh boy was this show a fun ride. I don\u2019t think I can remember one point in the show where I even considered dropping the show, something that doesn\u2019t happen too often seeing as how in most of the shows Iwatch I end up thinking such thoughts on multiple occasions (ironically I almost always end up finishing a show no matter how bad it is); this is exemplified by the fact that I managed to watch it in its entirety in one day, all in one sitting in fact. Fast paced action, dystopic setting, and amazing music. This show grabbed me and without warning threw me into the fray of its action and will most likely do the same thing to you if given the chance.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nCharacters: 6\\n\r\nCharacter Development: 7\\n\r\nPlot: 8\\n\r\nPacing: 8\\n\r\nAnimation: 8\\n\r\nMusic: 9\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: 79/100\\n\r\nSPOILER WARNING:\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nAldnoah Zero's characters are obviously the biggest problem with the show as a whole, poorly created characters accompanied by a mediocre script at best, not a very good foundation for a show that was advertised as the next big Gen Urobuchi show. However even with his aid it still fell short. Being the man behind the story of Aldnoah Zero he laid the base for its creation, however after that point it was up to the rest of the crew to pull their weight and put forward as much if not more creativity. Unfortunately it is pretty obvious that most of the problems come up in the finer details rather than the show as a whole. Returning to my main point regarding the flawed and uninteresting characters, we have our main protagonist Kaizuka Inaho who is characterized by almost no traits at all. Throughout the show we are lead to believe that he is supposed to embody the strong silent archetype, however we are never really given any explanation as to why he is that way as a character. He constantly goes about making decisions that have serious weight in his world, however we are never introduced to his motivations, or any explanation as to why he takes such actions. The only time where we are even given a slight justification behind his character is in the ninth episode during some casual chatter between his sister Yuki and his friend Calm; wherein his sister describes him as not being as expressionless and cold as we are lead to believe, and that in fact there are very minute changes in his personality that are noticeable in certain situations, and that it is most noticeable around the Vers princess. This would make for an interesting point if it were truly the case. In reality he isn't truly a deep character who is characterized by his ability to analyze battle situations. While that may have been the case in the first battle with a martian kataphrakt (the robots), in which we are shown a fleshed out analysis of the situation, which leads to its eventual destruction through much effort and tribulation (note how this all happens in the episodes written by Gen Urobuchi), however in the following fights it seems as if instead of solving a puzzle the main character just pulls a bunch of convenient situations out of his ass. To top it off, while sure he might be able to figure out how to defeat the enemies at times, why is it always him who figures it out. Is the show implying that some random boy is more capable than the entirety of earth's military?\\n\r\nA lot of people have qualms with the story saying: \u201cit is ridden with plot holes, none of which do the show any justice\u201d, I however must disagree. I found that the premise was a refreshing take on a sci-fi space drama. Instead of it being aliens that are directly taking over the whole of the human race, it instead the humans corrupted by greed and power thanks to alien technology. It was a new and interesting premise that had me on the edge of my seat a lot of the time. These supposed plot holes that so many people complain about are often the result of the sci-fi genre. When you tell a story supposedly taking place in the future with advanced technologies that we have no understandings of, we cannot call such things plot holes. While the characters may have enough smudges in explanation and characterization to cover the entire planet, the plot is facing no such problems; not yet at least (good job season 2 for breaking the mold). Unexpected plot twist that don\u2019t go over the top of your head (except for that one scene in the end) accompanied by good pacing that doesn\u2019t leave you questioning what happened Serves up a very interesting premise that will enthrall most if not all of its viewers.\\n\r\nIf I had to pin down a few points in which I felt that Aldnoah Zero did well, one of those would be the animation, however like many aspects of the show, when you look past its front you notice several flaws with its execution. Mech shows tend to be the prime offenders when it comes to over use of CG in order to cut down on the budget. Aldnoah Zero is no exception to this principle, unfortunately the kataphrakts are done with CG, and while they are not jarring like how most computer generated objects are (in fact they blend in quite well with the rest of the show), it is still annoying how often they throw in a three dimensional object into a two dimensional scene. It shows several things, but the main point that it shows is a lack of desire to give life to the show; simply put it is lazy and it pisses me off. I personally don\u2019t tend to enjoy shows centered entirely on the fact that there are mechs, instead shows such as this, Code Geass, and Neon Genesis where the mechs are just used as part of the narrative and not as the narrative itself. However that said, from the older shows that I\u2019ve seen that mech centered, I enjoyed much more thoroughly then I do now a days, I feel that the fact that the mechs are drawn 100% of the time adds something to the viewing experience. Enough on that though, everything else looks superb, battle sequences are done superbly and all of the small details make for fun action when it is needed, and nice looking scenes when they are called for.\\n\r\nIn terms of the music, there isn\u2019t much that I should have to say, it was eye opening to say the least. Anyone who has watched the show knows how good the soundtrack is, I personally have several of the songs downloaded on my phone to listen to them whenever I want. The soundtrack is probably one of the most memorable aspects of the show alongside the story and the ending.\\n\r\nFinally if you\u2019ve managed to get to the end of this review hopefully I\u2019ve managed one of two things, instill in you the desire to go and watch this show if you haven\u2019t yet, or at least add it to your plan to watch list.",

            "content": "Aldnoah Zero is a futuristic war anime that does a fairly good job of avoiding many of the pitfalls that mecha anime tend to tumble into on a regular basis. In an alternate history, astronauts discover an advanced power left behind by an ancient civilization on the moon. This power allows them to separate themselves from society on Earth and partially terraform Mars, which they make their home. It's not long before war breaks out between the Earth and Mars. 15 years prior to the start of the series, the moon is literally shattered during combat, and somehow the two sides settle into an uneasypeace.\\n\\n\r\nThe war is renewed when a visiting Martian princess is attacked by terrorists during a visit to Earth. The forces of Mars descend onto Earth in force. Here's where the series does a great job of not letting the mecha get too far out of whack. The Martians do have some nifty powers in their mechs, but never do they become unexplainably powerful, or lacking any sort of weakness. The earth forces use much less extravagant mechs that are easier to relate to as potentially recognizable military hardware so the conflict isn't entirely alien in nature.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters, the way the war is setup does allow for a semi-feasible insertion of the stereotypical Japanese high school student cast, war tensions and universal conscription. I did enjoy the way the male lead ends up turning down better equipment as the series moves on, choosing a beat up trainer mech painted neon orange as his ride throughout. It makes the scenario a little more desperate and human.\\n\\n\r\nThat said...I don't really like the cast of characters, particularly on the Earth side. Nothing really changes for them. They are constantly on the run and trying to avoid death at every turn. Most of the character development is experienced through the anti-hero(?) a Earthling boy that ends up living among the Martians. From his view you see the inner workings of the Martian society, and it's where the series gets it's somewhat dark, cynical aura from. That said, the series avoids painting either side as innate good or evil, a trap that has easily doomed many a war anime to first level mediocrity. The Earthling hero suffers from a borderline case of \u201cToo badass to relate to\u201d but constantly being outgunned somewhat compensates for this. I would have liked it a lot more if the series showed us a crack in his shell. I liked his calm, matter-of-fact nature, but after awhile I want to know he's still human. As for everyone else, you can take them or leave them. The princess is dragged around by circumstance. So are the rest. I was going to rate this series significantly lower than I ended up doing mainly because of the ending so far. I'm not going to spoil it, but I think it's worth seeing though to the end.\\n",

            "content": "'It is like Code Geass!' they said. 'It questions racism and what it is to be a species,' they said.\r\n'Eggs,' Inaho replied back, his face unchanged by the barrage of compliments.\r\nThe fans of Aldnoah.Zero looked at each other and shrug, 'Hey, it is best sort of humor a show like this can make.'\r\nNo, no it isn't.\r\nThe story is decent. Not much of it memorable, maybe a few 3D animated fight scenes here and there. Humans are fighting... humans. Not martians (as the show loves to point out), just people who live on Mars. Even when the ...ugh, 'Martians' gain overwhelming power, they would still havehuman blood running through them. It makes no sense why they would dissociate completely from the ...oh come on, 'Terrians'?! Who the fuck came up with that sort of conflict? Sure racism can exist between humans, however the only things that are different about the 'Martians' and the 'Terrians' (is that how you spell it?) is where they live. Not skin color, not ethical differences, just financial and living area differences. No human being would ever, I mean ever, think that those two differences means that they are a completely new race.\\n\\n\r\nArt is stunning. I mean, apart from the blatantly crap 3D animated mechas - which are even animated 3D in static backgrounds -, A1Pictures have talented artists that can draw and animate with fluidity and beauty. Maybe the characters have a case of the duckbill-lip syndrome, but the setting and fight scenes are explosively intricate and enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is the best thing about this show. Sawano Hiroyuki is one of the best composers present in the industry currently. If you are a producer and want to have an awesome dubstep-piano soundtrack, look no further than to Sawano. Even when your story is predictable and ridiculous - or even when your character are as bland as they concrete they destroy with their mechas (we'll come to that soon enough) - if you have Mr. Sawano as a composer on your team, the soundtrack is guaranteed to not flop like the rest of your anime. Great man!\\n\r\nThe voice actors were also good, even though their characters limited their ability.\\n\\n\r\nOh god, the characters. The characters. I mean, come on Gen - wait, he only wrote the first episode? The good episode? Who wrote the rest of it... a Takayama Katsuhiko? That makes sense now. Anyway, the characters are bland and uninteresting. Inaho is a cardboard box that eats poultry that is more rounded than himself. The only other character I remember by name is Slaine - and he is just another emo blond character with identity issues. There was also that princess-girl, what was her name? Asses- no, that is probably the most ridiculous name for a character I have ever seen. Sweet merciful egg- I mean Christ, dammit!\\n\\n\r\nThe only enjoyment you can get out of this show are the fight scenes and the amount of jokes you can make out of the bland characters. I watched this show in sub and in the middle of a scene, I turned off the sound and began mocking stupid voices for each of the characters. That made it so much more interesting and I got a lot more out of it. But aside from that, this show bored the fuck out of me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would not recommend this to anyone who has - or hasn't - seen anime in their lives. It will ruin your perception on the whole industry. Do not watch this show. DON'T EVEN STREAM IT. I couldn't finish this one, especially after finding out the ending of season two. Not worth the wait.",

            "content": "Aldnoah.Zero was an interesting anime, to say the least. It had plenty of unexpected turns that made it so I couldn't predict the end halfway through.\r\nBackground:\r\nThe story revolves around the concept that a long time ago a bunch of people left Earth to colonize Mars. There, they found a mysterious power called Aldnoah that advanced their technology immensely, but could only be used by the select few that swore fealty to the royal line. After some hubbub a decade or so before the story takes place, Mars and Earth got on some pretty bad terms. The story actually begins with the princess of Mars comingto visit Earth in order to establish better relations between the two races. Unfortunately, not everyone wishes for peace and, one attack on the princess later, Mars declares all-out war on Earth in order to exact its vengeance.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nThe story focuses around two main characters, each on opposite sides of the war. Inaho, the Earth-side hero, is a calm, level-headed tactician who appears to be an expert at taking down advanced technology no matter how much his companions panic. Slaine, the other main character, doesn't really fight for Mars so much as he fights to protect the princess from those who want her dead, which is rather difficult given that friend and foe aren't clearly defined for him. The characters of the show aren't really mold-breaking, but that didn't stop them from growing on me.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound: 7\\n\r\nThe show looked good and sounded good. The kataphrakt (mecha) in the show are animated well and watching them fight in closer proximity can be terrific to watch. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 6\\n\r\nHere's the main falling point I found with the show. The show did its best to break away from the predictable mold of what you would expect to have happen. This certainly made each episode interesting to watch and difficult to predict. Unfortunately, sometimes characters seemed to be making decisions on a whim that existed solely to make sure that the show didn't follow a typical occurrence. \\n\r\nEx: Char A meets Char B and they should be enemies, but instead they buddy up and eat dinner instead of hashing it out right then and there.\\n\r\nAlso: the story ended in a somewhat unfinished way, which is fine since they intend to do a season 2, but it's quite annoying to see such an interesting show decide to leave itself in a cliffhanger.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nEven with the story occasionally making some convoluting decisions about where to send its characters, it's never really a dull ride. Characters might be somewhat tedious at times, but they grow on you over time and the show's unpredictable nature makes it so no one has perfect plot-armor. This imperfect-plot armor makes it so each encounter at least provides some tension as to whether or not a character will make it out unscathed. The fights between different Kataphrakts are entertaining to watch, and provide well-timed breaks from inaction.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\r\nI think I'd hold off on recommending this anime until the second season is underway. The show is certainly good enough to watch, but its uncertain ending makes it somewhat hard to recommend it in good conscience.",

            "content": "I've noticed that nearly all the reviews for this show are quite negative and I'll admit that when I read their reviews, the critiques made sense. However, I feel that people should also see a review of this show from the perspective of someone who enjoyed it. This is only for S1. I'll be making a separate review for S2.\r\nStory\r\nThe story basically follows a 2 faction war set-up with one faction being more powerful than the other. The Martians and the terrans have been in a stalemate for a long time now and the supposed assassination of the martian princess who tries to negotiate forpeace starts the war. Although the set-up is nothing really new (other reviews may have mentioned that it's very similar to a Gundam anime plot), the introduction is very exciting and fast-paced. The show also follows the story from 2 points of view, with Inaho providing the Terran's point of view and Slaine providing the martian's point of view. What I especially liked about the show is how it portrays Inaho's (Terran's side) reliance on strategy and quick thinking in order to match and beat the more powerful Martians. I always felt excited whenever they'd meet a new enemy and I'd ask my self \"how will they take it down this time?\". On the other hand, Slaine's (Martian's side) point of view added supplementary details to the story as he tries to uncover the secret plot by the martian counts (kinda like their generals) against their own princess. It is also through his point of view that the mechanics of the martian's cataphracts (not sure if I spelled that right), its energy source, aldnoah, and the politics of the martian feudalistic system are explained. I will admit that there were some plot holes and that the plot armor got annoying at times (especially when you watch the ending of S1 and the 1st episode of S2) but overall, I still found the plot compelling enough to keep me looking forward to the next episode.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nThe art was overall okay. I especially liked the designs of the martian cataphracts. I've noticed that some people commented that the \"robots\" (I'm referring to the cataphracts) in this show were not memorable at all and for the most part, I'd have to agree. However, it didn't really bother me so much. The martian cataphracts were more distinguishable but since they usually didn't last very long (Inaho tends to beat them in 1-2 episodes) I'd understand why they weren't memorable. The terran cataphracts were pretty much standard (imagine \"clone trooper\" standard but not as memorable) with Inaho's cataphract (think it's named Sleipnir) being the only one to really stand out because of its orange color. The reason why I didn't have much of a problem with this is because it made sense. The terrans, with their inferior technology, relied on numbers and tactics so it makes sense for their cataphracts to be \"standard issue\". The martians on the other hand had more advanced technology so it makes sense if they had more leeway into designing their cataphracts. Overall, I'd  say that the art was pretty much standard.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nFor me, the sound was one of the best aspects of this show. The battle songs/sound will really get you in the mood and they also match the situation pretty well. The only downside is that it was pretty much the same 2 iconic songs throughout the show (S2 included) with some deviations. If you enjoyed the shingeki no kyojin soundtrack, then you might find this show's soundtrack enjoyable as well. (Favorite song from this show is aLIEz because it sounded pretty epic. I'd get goose bumps when I hear it while I was watching).\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nThis is the part where I'll  agree with the critics of the show. Aside from Slaine, the characters were pretty bland. Inaho was interesting at first. Rayet and Marito might also catch your attention but they never really got any significant character development. In fact, even Slaine doesn't get any significant character development until towards the end of the series (although he will get it during S2). The princess, despite being a main character, isn't even worth mentioning in my opinion and I swear that about half of Edelrittio's lines was \"hime-sama\". This is really the weakest aspect of the show in my opinion. There are 2 good things about the characters: the romance wasn't forced (no unnecessary harems as far as I could tell) and no one felt ridiculously overpowered (perhaps Inaho because of his insane tactics but I didn't really feel it while I was watching).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nThe show has its flaws and yes it was over-hyped but I still found it very entertaining. As I've said, the plot is developed in such a way that I was genuinely excited and looking forward to what will happen next. The ending was a bit of a shocker and could be frustrating for some but I can definitely say that I enjoyed this show. \\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nObjectively I'd say that the show is average, but personally I'd say that it's borderline great-above average. If you're the kind of person who wants a solid plot with great character development, then this show is definitely not for you. However, if you simply want to enjoy a fast paced action show with epic battles (ex. SAO less the harem and filler arcs) then you may want to give this show a try.",

            "content": "*I have tried to minimize SPOILERS, but nonetheless they are present*. \r\n\u201cOnly the dead have seen the end of war\u201d. Fast forward a few thousand years, and Plato\u2019s sentiments still hold true today. Aldnoah Zero is a show that demonstrates the different aspects of war and how it is similar to our Earthly conflicts through its characters and the causes and effects of war. If you focus on purely enjoyment, then you will miss out on critical themes throughout the show.\r\nWhile the viewer is swept along by Aldnoah Zero\u2019s fast progression, the allusion to time and its passage is important to the show\u2019s purpose.Looking at the episode titles alone details the passage of time and how it affects the characters, especially the children and teenagers; going from \u201cPrincess Vers\u201d (E.1) to \u201cThe Children\u2019s Echelon\u201d (E.3) shows that war doesn\u2019t wait for anyone, and sooner or later you will be dragged into it. Inaho and his friends go from hanging out and enjoying teenage life to manning Kataphrakts in Earth\u2019s fight to survive the Vers invasion, all within a few days. The \u201cPoint of No Return\u201d (E.4) brings an end to one fight, but innocence has already been claimed; Rayet sees her father killed before her eyes as a result of the war, and she is affected by this occurrence throughout the show. Even when there isn\u2019t room to breathe or a moment to relax between fights in Aldnoah Zero, the titles \u201cThen and Now\u201d (E.8), \u201cBefore the War\u201d (E.10), and \u201cChildhood\u2019s End (E.12) from the latter half of the show stress the importance of how quickly life can change \u2013 especially for those affected by war \u2013 over a short period of time. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter development was minimal at an individual level, but the effects that war had on the populations was evident.  Princess Seyleum was consistently overly optimistic and friendly throughout the show to both Vers people and Terrans; she did not have much, if any at all, character development. Her intent was to get both sides to \u201cset aside their hatred\u201d and stop the war. Inaho is a static character throughout the show, eliciting no emotion and not allowing it to hinder his decision-making during the war. He started in the show as a precocious teenager who, once he knew his objective, would carry out the mission without fault, and he ended in the same way. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, Inaho provided insight regarding war that helped build two thoughts as to why war is fought. Toward the end of the show, Inaho asks Princess Seyleum \u201cwhat does it take to end a war\u201d, to which she responds \u201cwell, if both sides wish for peace and set aside their hatred\u201d. At first glance, Seyleum is either playing true to her overly optimistic character or is na\u00efve, since war doesn\u2019t start merely due to anger and hatred, right? That is what Inaho thinks, stating:\\n\\n\r\n\u201cwarfare is nothing but a means of negotiation between states. Wars break out even when there is no hatred. Territory, resources, or interests that you are determined to own. Ideology, religion, pride. Wars are fought over those objectives all the time. Meaning that when those objectives are met, the war will end\u2026anger and hatred, those are nothing more than tools to tilt a war in your favor\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nInaho believes that the Vers invasion is rooted in a desire for Earth\u2019s resources and that the events toward the princess are simply the casus belli. Assuming that Count Saazbaum, the leader of the Knights, is the one who devised the plan that put the show into motion, he provides us with an insight as to why the war started. While Saazbaum doesn\u2019t undergo character development, the loss of (XYZ) is one of the main causes for his hatred toward the Terrans. This, alongside what has been engrained in his mind (and other Vers people) throughout his life, provides the reasoning behind his wish for war. So, who was right, Seyleum or Inaho? It is hard to exactly say given how much detail the show gives us, but we do know that Saazbaum hates Terrans for what they did to (XYZ) and that he stated it is his duty to expand his peoples\u2019 territory, and when one is given power, it is hard to determine if they will make a rational or moral decision.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, this brings us to Slaine, who sees the most development and is arguably the main character. Throughout the show, Slaine is forced to make decisions that weigh on his ties to both Terrans and Vers people as he investigates events. This balancing act between both parties puts him in a grey area with the viewer and also raises the question: where does one draw his alliances and loyalties? Slaine starts off as friend of the princess and she is where his loyalty lies. Keeping this in mind, we watch as Slaine struggles throughout the show to find his identity amidst the battlefield. Where he cries while killing one character, he is mute and unfaltering when being tortured. Both situations demonstrate the mature and difficult decisions he faces and his unwavering devotion to the princess \u2013 his only constant throughout the show. And it is with that one constant in his life, when pulled from underneath him, we see what it means to lose one\u2019s sense of purpose and how, when the constant in your life falters or is taken from you, it impacts the individual.\\n\\n\r\nAldnoah Zero showed us that war is bleak. It affects everyone, whether directly or indirectly. It claims innocence and forces you to make grave decisions no matter your age. It makes you wish for a previous time where the days don\u2019t seem like hours. After all that has occurred along the way, what all has changed? Has the war ended? Was anything resolved? All we can be certain of is that \u201conly the dead have seen the end of war\u201d.\\n\\n\r\n-------------------------\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nYou can\u2019t go wrong with Kalafina and Hiroyuki Sawano.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\\n",

Although (spoiler alert) they did hint a little romance in the end scene, speaking about the end scene i mean come on did not see that coming, now that made this anime to be honest the ending is a little weird, and it made me feel angry towards a character witch is rare for me. but thats good very good. overall if you want to see an anime with action and strategy i strongly recommendthis one :D",

It is a nice story actually and personally i enjoyed it. The humans reached Mars thanks to a portal, and they started to colonize it. Then the new martians found a revolutionary technology called Aldnoah and start a rebellion against the earth. Well you may think, really Mars ? Isn\u00b4t that over explored.. well yeah it is but still the rest is quite original.  \r\nYeah and this anime has the most trollerend that i've ever saw .. we get like \"wtf srsly what just happened\" .. well just seeing the end you will get to it . \\n\\n\r\nArt: (8/10). The characters have a nice shape although while I was watching i felt some sort of weirdness looking at their faces, it didn\u00b4t looked well at least for me. But well thats just me talking. The art is good and the detail of the machines (yes there is machines here because it is a mecha anime) are really great. The background although . it could be better when we have such design with the machines. \\n\\n\r\nSound: (9/10). I loved the opening, what a beautiful song ! And we have in the first episodes a nice soundtrack, similliar to AoT(Atack on Titan) but yet far way from the epicness of AoT. BUT, i don\u00b4t know why, it seems that they forgot the first OST that they used, and applied new ones that were not better which for me ruined it. While in the first part, the sound fits nice with the \"epic action\", when the action gets better at the end, the sound gets worst, and when the sound gets worst, the action gets worst to. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:  (6/10). Clich\u00ea clich\u00ea clich\u00ea clich\u00ea ... The clich\u00ea brained guy that seems to not care about anything. The clich\u00ea girl that wants to save everything. Well the rest? We don\u00b4t even hear talk about them. Actually the only interesting character here is Slain, with a unknown background at least i wished to know more about him. \\n\\n\r\nAbove all of that, it stills a nice anime to entertain. Now the second is being released and I hope for it go get a lot better.",

            "content": "Aldnoah.Zero is a show that, despite its amazing (not to mention unique!) plot with, despite the directior (of Fate/Zero fame) having only (allegedly) been in involved with the first 3 episodes only, and great bulidup, it surprisingly fails to build up on the character development. Not to say that the characters aren't good, but more often than not, I found myself rooting for the Martians. \r\nArt - 9\r\nThe art is well, to say the least, PHENOMENAL. All the characters are like nothing we've seen before, and the CGI for the mechas looks amazingly smooth to the point that, you forget that it's supposed to beCG.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 6\\n\\n\r\nNow as I said before, more often than not, I cared more for what the Martians are doing, instead of what the humans are doing. I'm sorry, but the humans are the poeple are supposed to be the people we're ROOTING for, yet the show barely gives us reason to care about them. Maybe the most fleshed out Terran is Lieutenant Marito, because every time he steps in a mecha, he suffers from PTSD, and the door is left wide open on that after 12 episodes. BUT. I will say this. and that is... SLAINE TROYARD BECOMES THE MOTHERFUCKING BOSS AFTER 12 EPISODES OF BEING A YOUNGBOY. I honestly thought he should have been the main character. But no, we get Inaho. Wheee.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10\\n\\n\r\nBut to be fair, the musical score is awesome. albeit a bit bland.\\n\\n\r\nFINAL VERDICT\\n\\n\r\nAldnoah.Zero is a good show, but it has one too many token Terran characters to make us care about them, hell, in the second or third episode alone, *SPOILERS* the bland slacker character gets killed, and we're supposed to care, but the thing is, we don't. If you want an anime where the antagonists are more fleshed than the protagonists, watch this. \\n\\n\r\nGRADE FOR ALDNOAH.ZERO: A-",

            "content": "\"Aldoah.Zero\" is an anime that will drag you through the episodes up to its chilling ending.\r\nWhen I saw the first episode of \"Aldnoah.Zero\", I thought it was exactly like a 25 minute movie. I should have learned (from Captain Earth) by now to turn back instantly.\r\nThis anime has three main characters: Inaho Kaizuka (Hanae, Natsuki), Asseylum \"Seylum\" Vers Allusia (Amamiya, Sora), and Slaine Troyard (Ono, Kensho). Starting with Inaho, here is a boy that quite resembles a robot, mainly having three emotions -- dull, happy, and frustrated. Throughout the series Inaho must be the least developed. However, in spite of the difficulty, Hanae (Kaneki Ken[Tokyo Ghoul]) gave a voice to the young boy. In this part, his voice is soft, breathy, and captures every part of Inaho's ... personality? Lack of one? In any case, Hanae did very well. Next is Princess Asseylum, a young royal who wishes for only peace between her nations and Earth's. She is a very kind and just girl, perfectly innocent and unaware of the ways of the world. Capturing her completely is Amamiya (Akame & Touka [Akame ga Kill & Tokyo Ghoul]), who just continues to amaze me with her voice. Amamiya's voice is soft, delicate, and perfectly innocent. She plays the princess part to a 'T.' Such a talented woman. Lastly (my favorite) is Slaine. Slaine has to be one of the most developed characters, starting from a weakling boy to a determined young man, most loyal to his princess. Slaine became my favorite character for his resilience, innocence, and determination. Qualities that Ono (Kuroko [Kuroko no Basket]) captures quite well. His voice is thin, and light (qualities I personally love). He molds his voice to fit Slaine's character perfectly, especially at the parts where Slaine has been deeply hurt and is crying or close to tears.\\n\\n\r\nI will flat out say that I am frustrated with \"Aldnoah.Zero\". It has perfect voices, gods as musicians, wonderful animation, and yet the story is filled with plot holes and mostly undeveloped characters. Inaho is probably the least likable character this season because he literally is a robot. He has no emotions, and not much is known about his besides the facts the he has an older sister, his mind is very analytical, and his smiles are rare (and even then they look almost fake). Getting that off my chest, I will continue to the plot. The anime started out wonderful. The introduction to the world contained beautiful art, many intriguing characters, and best of all, Yuki Kajiura's music as well as Hiroyuki Sawano's. From there it went downhill (and I should have guessed thanks to Captain Earth). The show continued only showing Slaine's and a Lieutenant\u2019s pasts. Without reading the summary, I probably would not have understood that Martians and Terrans used to be one and the same. The show continues, almost as if it's making the plot up as it goes along. And it all comes down to one chilling ending, with a note saying \" Aldnoah.Zero - Let Justice be done. Through Heaven's Fall - Next January A.D. 2015 \"\\n\\n\r\nBut if you like mecha animes, you will not be disappointed with \"Aldnoah.Zero\". The animation is great, and its concept of mechs is intriguing. There is so much detail put into the machines. This 'Aldnoah' power is especially interesting. It's better than electricity, makes the Martians' mechas better in some way, and yet only certain people can use it. If you are a lover of anime for the character development like me, then you may not like this anime. Or it might just be average to you. I did enjoy this anime, but it left me feeling very frustrated.\\n\\n\r\n-\\n\\n\r\nStory - 8\\n\r\nThe concept is very good, but it definitely needed more than twelve episodes to bring out its full potential. Other than that, it is really an interesting storyline.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9\\n\r\nThe art used cool pastels to paint the anime in very innocent light. The character designs we nice and original. I was even impressed with the CGI. It didn't look corny like most scenes when other animes use CGI.\\n\\n\r\nMusic - 10\\n\r\nOf course I'm going to give this score to my music gods. Kajiura has done it again, getting Kalafina to perform \"Aldnoah.Zero's\" opening. Her music has such an ethereal quality that fit the unrealistic world. Her's and Sawano's music are a perfect complement for each other. And Sawano brings out all the stops, creating epic battle music that just got my heart to race.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 4\\n\r\nI was severely disappointed with the lack of character development. Most of the characters were intriguing, but none really ever grew. And then there's the robotic main character of the series, Inaho, with his emotionless face. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8\\n\r\nThis anime started out as one I was excited to see every week, but my hype died down a bit into just being pleased by each episode that came out. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7.8\\n\r\nAs frustrating as it became, I still have to say I enjoyed \"Aldnoah.Zero.\" I am really hoping that the next season exceeds my expectations and becomes this great, epic story.\\n\\n\r\n[So sorry for all the Captain Earth references! Just had to get that off my chest XD]",

            "content": "What happens when you have Gen Urobuchi, Hiroyuki Sawano, and Kalafina all working in the same project? Pure awesomeness you say? You'd be wrong, but it's not precisely their fault... or yours. If you are thinking of watching this series, think again. This is one of those series that start up great but do not live up to their potential. Be warned, if you are a hardcore fan of mechas you will probably want to pass on this anime. I'm serious; I think I didn't hate it precisely because I'm not a big fan of mechas.\r\nIs this series terrible? Personally, I think it is enjoyable,but really underwhelming considering the people attached to the project. Now I have to mention that Urobuchi only wrote the first 3(!!) episodes, so that explains a lot.\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\r\nI'm not a big fan of mechas so I think I enjoyed the story more than a fan of the genre. Still, from my own experience, this feels like Code Geass and Gundam, (that is, politics, deep characters, complex plots, and betrayals left and right) but doesn't manage to even hold a candle to them. I'm not knowledgeable enough to call it a Gundam ripoff, but it\u2019s a common opinion in the forums. After all, there's not a lot originality here, just your typical sci-fi conflict of people living on earth against those who live in space and, in this case, Mars. There are even some Evangelion vibes here.\\n\r\nIn order to get the full story you are absolutely required to watch the second season, which is not very good. This is because the first season ends with a huge cliffhanger, and if you get this far you will probably be invested enough to continue watching. Think of it as a 2-cour show with a break in between.\\n\r\nIf you know Urobuchi's previous works, you will know what to expect in terms of plot twists regarding characters. Without giving away details, you will find a lot of underwhelming subversions to his writing. I found myself constantly thinking \"Is this really Urobuchi's work? How can this be?\" Well, that was before I knew he only wrote the first 3 episodes. The most likely explanation is that Urobuchi's original idea was changed by the rest of the writing team (I read that he actually left the project), probably hoping there would be more seasons. Now the story it's not bad, I kinda liked it but it certainly doesn't live up to Urobuchi's potential. The science behind the titular Aldnoah, a mysterious source of energy, is never explained or explored in detail!! Other sciency aspects of the show are not explained and only hinted at; the show forgoes spoonfeeding entirely for the sake of better pacing. The problem is that this happens frequently in battles, so expect a lot of asspulls. The first episode starts really slow, a lot of infodump in the first half followed by jaw-dropping action on the second half. The 2nd and 3rd episodes are pretty solid, but after that the plot is not that good. So yeah, this goes to show that the 3-episode rule doesn't always apply.",

This is that anime.\r\n*Characters largely forgetable except for the main lead who is a cross-over between Levi and Lelouche recieving the badass traits but also the uncharismatic traits of both.\r\n*The Plot is about Marsians' Rebellion and humanity's last stand a.k.a.  Attack on Mecha, where it's all up to a couple of school kids to outwit the galactic empire.\r\n*Music is as expected with the \"run to the mill epics\" with choirs and everything. Still, I can't remember a single track so I guess itdid it's job as ambience if anything.\\n\\n\r\n*Artstyle quality is what is to be expected by an animation studio of this day and age with a decent budget. It was good but once again, it was nothing that really stood out.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, an average/slightly-above \\n\r\n-average anime with good entertainment value.\\n\\n\r\noh and before I go: Slaine. He is the patron saint of shitty luck so if you ever have a bad day, just think of Slaine and consider yourself lucky :)",

            "content": "Story: 9\r\nI was going to score it a little lower on account of the immense desire to wage war displaced by the orbital knights. However I changed my opinion on that because I can see where they come from and find that interesting to why they wish to battle. I don't think it was right of course but I like how corruption in the ranks of an already corrupt society blew up a massive war as they did. I love the contradiction in fighting ones own race as if they were separate when they are only a few centuries off separation less different than Earth'sown individual countries. This anime took war to a different level. Mind you I dislike big monster battles or mech battles for the larger part but this anime did it for me. It wasn't about explosions but how to make a real war of it. If I were to pick at one thing it was the need to always have the main cast there, but that was kind of justified in them having the...big machine from Mars I can't spell and won't look up. I get that they didn't have to pilot it but get that they have experience with it. It's very opinionated but it's not enough to drop it any lower. I think the story was simply great altogether and loved it. The ending as well was something I just did not expect and adored.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nThe art was amazing. No question about it. It made everything so real even though obviously it wasn't. But I could delve into the world and experience what was happening. Everything was so fluid I could sit in awe of just how good the animation was. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThe music fitted each scene great and it did exactly what I like and flowed with the animation and atmosphere really well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nThey were great. They felt 3-dimensional and I was really invested in what would happen to them. I found times where I was unsure and then they would surprise me with the best scene to follow. I amazed that I don't have a single problem with the characters. As I said there were times I was unsure but that was early on before they were as far developed. Which was done excellently. No gripe and not much else to say.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nCome on it's awesome.",

            "content": "Aldnoah.Zero, how fascinating really is to have another Mecha anime. Sure are very hyped and disappointing for some. Why? The Sponsor are damn confident they can take-over Gundam and other mecha anime. Heck, every well-know mecha anime seems to be a long-runner, though.\r\nNow, into the real question. Did they done just that? Or they fail... quite miserably?\r\nStory is mediocre at best, 5/10\r\n\"Let Justice Be Done, Though The Heavens Fall.\"\r\nThe premise, raised us some bad things from the past. Now, humanity are separated into two; Terran, people of the earth. And Martians, people of the mars. We saw a glimpse of the after-math between their wars,and the (maybe) important Heavens Fall.\\n\r\nThen, things just became more and more downhill from there...\\n\r\nOur cute princess who adores the earth, and her lecturer of earth, a Terran who also happened to be the Woobie. One fateful day changed everything. As the princess visits earth, she was assassinated. Wat.\\n\r\nEnter our main protagonist, a tactical child soldier from Terran. And his army to fight off the Martian's super-powered mech. Then, there's the plot-twist... and the ending.\\n\\n\r\nArt is beautiful with flaws, 8/10\\n\r\nThe art of Aldnoah is well polished with nice detailed backgrounds and very nice design overall. Their character was drawn as uniquely as possible (in-universe lol).\\n\r\nFlaw is the Mech itself. What's with the CGI? I can't friggin tell. The Terran's mech is especially meh, justified as it's for war and they didn't care as long they win.\\n\r\nThe Martians mech in the other hand... is vague? They are shaped from... things. And named from... something on their planet.\\n\r\nFortunately, the animators are smart enough to hide it with camera angle, lighting, etc.\\n\\n\r\nSound is very good and bombastic, 8/10\\n\r\nThe voice of the characters is well-done. OR rather i don't care at all, as long it remains good and not silly-milly.\\n\\n\r\nThe music\u2013 is great. Hiroyuki Sawano sure is a talented composer. Still they used it extensively over-used which means its also became an epic ear-hurt.\\n\r\nSpecial mention to the greatest of them all? Ending theme of the season's cliffhanger.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter is alive but not kicking or vice-versa, 4/10\\n\r\nHeh, i'll only mention six.\\n\r\nFirst, Inaho. Very complex, \"who's the real him, what made him like that, and why he is so calm?\" is probably every person reaction to him. He's a Gary Stu according to some, it means he is overly-idealized, perfect, etc. Me? I'm the minority that thinks he's not. He is VERY flawed. Not going to describe more. Hey, he's badass and calm, and i like that.\\n\r\nSecond, Slaine. Just what the heck is he doing? He takes action by emotion and act like the Woobie, just like certain ninja clan. Like Inaho, he is DAMN flawed. Not going to describe more. And hey, he's Bad Luck Slaine, he's interesting but extremely annoying.\\n\r\nThird, Asseylum. Wait, Saylum? Essaylum? Ass\u2013Eylum? Kinda hard to describe. Cute princess is cute. But brave, pacifist, and actually do things. Still, cute princess is cute. And being her is suffering.\\n\r\nFourth, Terran. Hmm...\\n\r\nFifth, Martians. Well...\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment and not yours, 7/10\\n\r\nMm-hmm... Definitely as a lot of flaws. But, great nonetheless.\\n\r\nGotta love the music and the action.\\n\\n\r\nThe overall and closing, 6/10\\n\r\nAldnoah.Zero is very flawed, i can at least recommend it to action lovers. But sure it doesn't deserve bashing and hate. Really anime-watchers is scary. By the way, don't you think Goddamn and Gundam sound alike?\\n\r\nHa, edited: I think i need to make Awkward Seal meme, or maybe Herp. (5+8+8+4+7):5 is 8? \\n\r\nC'mon, brain. You can do better.",

IF, and that's a very big IF, this show takes a different direction in the second season it could change my personal feelings of the first season entirely.\r\nThe art style is really great to watch and was a big draw for me. The story is ok and ultimately is hard to give an accurate rating to from the first season alone. The sound is fine with the intro and credit music being BIG highlights. The characters really grewon me and eventually it is really easy to become invested in the story and their interactions. However, the first season is a real bore to get into and I had to attempt the first episode several times before getting through it. The dialogue is heavy and the characters really seem lifeless at first. In addition, the amount of missing background information can be overwhelming. However, it picks up considerably leading to some really emotional and well presented battle scenes, so well presented that they may be some of the best of the genre that I have seen. The way each encounter is meticulously thought through really shines. The tension built between characters, their deep and growing relationships and the emotional ride the show takes you on ends up in a potentially unsatisfying conclusion depending on your preference. Some may love it, others may hate it. Approach this one with a bit of caution, the high-tech, heavy-story is a great ride to go on but ends a bit up in the air. I have yet to see the second season which will greatly influence my opinion of the first, but I recommend not getting to far into this unless you intend to also give the second season a go.",

            "content": "TLDR: Worth the watch, even for non mech fans. Get hype for season 2\r\nAldnoah zero was one an acclaimed mech anime from summer 2014 that shows us both sides of an invasion where you could choose who is in the right. The story here was well written and follows multiple different characters. Basically, there are three sides in this war (Earth, Vers, and Slaine) where we follow 2 of those sides until they all collide at the climax. There is enough action each episode to keep those who dislike background information and character development interested. The shows pacing was great for one cour; we followonly a small part of the world, but after three quarters of the way through connect with the rest to face the challenge. What the story is missing is more background information that would help it. We were only given small spoonfuls of history at a time, and I was craving for more. What the show sacrifices in world building, it makes up for in character development. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters make a show, and the characters in Aldnoah Zero are excellent. Slaine shows the struggle of ideals and beliefs. He wants to help the princess he loves, and proves that many times, but after learning different truths over time, fights for a different cause and helps others. He put his life on the line to help another cause and was shot down (literally). There is controversy around the ending of the show; however, Slaine had developed into someone different throughout the show and his ideals changed. Our MC was one of the only faults of the characters in A/Z, alongside the princess. He was your emotionless genius protagonist (that's not actually seen much, right?) who brought hope to those around him. He was rather one dimensional and flat. The princess had a similar role as other  princesses- the enemy that tries for peace. Se Euphie from Code Geass or Nia from TTGL. She wasn't all that original: beautiful, good relationship with MC, father/grandfather is the tyrant who doesn't really care what happens to her, etc. The characters that are important are Marito, Saazbaum, and Cruhteo. Cruhteo makes a great foil to Saazbaum as he desires war to avenge his princess and what he believes in, whereas Saazy wants (more personal) revenge vs the system he's a part of. Both are greatly written enemies that represent the two different factions on the Versian side (both oppose Earth, one would be the supporters of war, others the princess). Marito is a well developed soldier that has to live with shame for the rest of his life for his past decisions (the right decision, mind you). His character shows the horrors of war, as well as the aftermath. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is not just above average, but the CGI works in this anime. A lot of people may disagree, but I think the CGI mecha's look really nice and improve the action sequences. The characters all look normal and have a considerable amount of depth to them (art wise and how they're written).  8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is one of the best I've listened to. The OP and ED are fantastic and I didn't even think about skipping them. Each song that was portrayed throughout the anime had tremendous effect- either to elicit emotion, or enhance action. 9/10. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I was not bored throughout the entirety and found each scene meaningful. I usually avoid mech anime; however, this one was quite solid. My only complaint for enjoyment would be that there seemed to be a minimum of one action scene per episode, which wasn't necessary for those who like plot development. Nothing really stopping me from giving this a 10 for enjoyment. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI'd rate A/Z a 8/10 and of the best anime from summer 2014. I'm really excited for A/Z season 2 as there is a lot left unknown.",

            "content": "You ever hear that joke; \"Why did the plane crash?\" and the punchline is \r\n\"Because the pilot was a loaf of bread\"?\r\nIn the same way, one could say that Aldnoah Zero 'crashed' as a mecha anime because its protagonist is like a loaf of bread. Expressionless and lifeless. His face remains straighter than my sexuality. \r\nInaho, the MC Alpha that's so badass; calm, collected and cunning - he doesn't need intimidating dialogue or brawn to beat his enemies, just his superior intellect. He is the one of the primary reasons I didn't enjoy this anime. I can't relate to a loaf of bread after-all, sowhy should I care when he gets ----- in his --- in episode -- ? Heck, I might have even enjoyed that scene really. \\n\r\nMC Alpha, is only Alpha because he can conveniently overcome any problem with calculations and scientific shit, or strategies pulled out of his asshole, really. If you thought Inaho's anus was stretched from that Aldnoah Zero Yaoi hentai (probably Inaho x Slaine) you looked at last night, think again. Nearly every episode, despite the Martian mech proving itself practically invincible to pleb Earth weapons, Inaho always finds a weakness within 2 minutes of fighting and makes a game changing play. Bam. \\n\r\nG fucking G (not even a well played). \\n\\n\r\nThe other MC Slaine, he's just constantly copping shit so often that you're forced to feel sorry for him. The Martian aristocracy throw abuse at him like bronze players throw League games. He gets put in the friendzone by his love-interest the princess because he's so beta. He gets stabbed in the back by Inaho, even though they just worked together and both want to help the princess? His story is intentionally made tragic and kinda pathetic to evoke sympathy.... but this serves as reverse psychology, and instead makes you feel otherwise and  dislike the guy for being such a fuckin beta compared to MC Alpha. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast aren't really worth mentioning. Girl 1 that has crush on Inaho. Redundant school mates that are later forgotten. Inaho's sister. A war veteran, struggling with PTSD (sounds deep right?), except can't get over his past and does nothing useful throughout the series. A Martian princess who appears to promote pacifism but is totally fine if MC Alpha kills some Martian baddies. \\n\r\nMediocre cast.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (solid 3/10) aside though, the plot (5/10) isn't amazing. The premise seems pretty cool and lured me in, Earth vs Mars, I was expecting lots of space battles or some shit. Nope. Watch as Earth gets wrecked effortlessly by bloodthirsty Martians who seem too overpowered for their own good. The typical AZ episode goes like this;\\n\\n\r\nOh no! What's that? A highly advanced Martian mecha just killed expendable mechas 11/22/33/44/etc. ? Damn, that weapon they have looked super strong when it killed Expendable Squad X, maybe Earth doesn't stand a chance.... but don't worry! MC Alpha willl just pull a plan out of his butthole, and singe handedly carry Earth to victory. Princess! Lend us your magic powers just so we can kill your people to show them how much we want peace :D. Meanwhile in space - Slaine? You wanna help us Martians? Get fucked, you stupid Terran piece of shit, good for nothing, ungrateful dog, etc.\\n\\n\r\nDespite what I feel was poor about this anime, the art (8/10) and sound (9/10) was really great. Good aesthetics, really good soundtrack. Enjoyable opening and ending. Enjoyment-wise however, wasn't super impressed, and more on the disappointed-side. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'd say Aldnoah Zero is decent for a mecha anime. While the fights were pretty much the same, featuring a Martian mecha using strange, unconventional weaponry (I have no clue why one uses big ass fists to try and fist her way through everything... wouldn't laser guns or maybe even regular guns have been fine??) destroy lots of expendable Earth forces, then have MC Alpha cheese the Martian mecha with some crap he's just made up on the spot or even worse, just cheeses them coz they have no clue how to fight on Earth (he beats them with water couple times, ahahaha). they were still slightly enjoyable to watch. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "In short: Only watch this anime if you're looking for great combat as well as for the great soundtracks.\r\nStory-wise, it's nothing amazing. Just basically two factions that face off against each other with two protagonists (who are just late teenagers) who are somehow the centre of everything. There is some development but it's nothing that you would really be watching for.\r\nMusic-wise, it is one of the best that I've listened to. It is composed by the amazing Sawano Hiroyuki who was responsible for Attack on Titan, Guilty Crown and Kill la Kill.\r\nArt-wise, it's pretty decent, I really liked the space art more than the earthart. Character designs were okay, not my type of art-style. However, I really did love the interior of the mechs which gave a much more interactive sense between the pilots and the vehicle, unlike other mech animes where the pilots just move hte joysticks about and the robot somehow behaves like a ballerina. The wide variety of other mechs (namely the alien ones) also served to prevent repetition of combat.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-wise, it was like Inaho was just created by word searching the list of traits a typical main protagonist has without even bothering to develop them. He just has... them... right from the start. Slaine was a little better than Inaho in that he had to work his way to his goal. Despite not even seeing each other most of the time, they seemed to share more interaction with each other than with their own faction members.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-wise, it was great... at least from watching the combat. It wasn't just your cookie cutter, Mr. X throws kick/punch or shoots and Mr. Y defends or hides. Every fight was different due to the different mechanics of the mechs. So sometimes they fought against a guy with a sword, sometimes a guy who could use lightning, sometimes against a guy with invisibility... there was a plethora of different approaches to defeating the seemingly invincible enemy. This is what made the show great.",

            "content": "Aldnoah Zero isn't your normal mechas-fighting-each-other-to-the-death anime. On the contrary, we are presented with an anime that pretty much focuses on 'how' you fight than 'with what' you fight. \r\nStarting off with the opening theme. The opening theme gives off the feel of the anime itself. It starts off peacefully and just branches into the suspense that you feel througout the anime. Afterwards the theme goes back into an emotional mood to emphasize the 'what is right' aspect of the anime.\r\nWhile the initial intro for the characters is very confusing at first, they each get traits that define them as individuals (except maybe Calm) throughoutthe anime. Although the protagonist is unrealistically intelligent, that is simply a minor flaw.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as story goes, It's main appeal is the cleverness of the protagonist Inaho and the character development of Slaine.  Another theme the anime executes nicely is the nature of war and the righteousness of the participants in a war. The presence of Aldnoah has changed the world greatly in this anime, and it's caused the development of this great storyline.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is an anime that caters both to mecha lovers and tactical thinkers. Even if you don't particularly like Gundams or the like, I would recommend this anime.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I will start off by saying, I enjoyed this seriously IMMENSELY despite it's issues. It is VERY Gundam Seed-like (I will be clear, I am not calling it a ripoff - though they are similar at the core, they went there own way with the genre/ideas/basic premises/etc) and as Gundam Seed is one of my favorite anime (and is, thus far, a far better anime) I thought I'd probably enjoy this series. And I really did.\r\nStory: 7.\r\nThe story is given a 7 as it isn't terribly original - however, it is a nice spin on the basic ideas of misunderstanding, war, racism, greed and envyplaced in a similar setting to the Gundam Series with the added layer of originality that is the Aldnoah power/drives.  As I enjoy these types of futuristic stories that echo issues of the past, this story was up my alley - however, I felt the 12 episode layout didn't allow it to dig deeper, flush itself out and really go where it could have, so it falls short of it's potential for me. Basically, you have two separate human factions - Earth and Mars -  fighting over differences and resources, a mysterious power that people found on Mars and used to create a Kingdom there, present vs past in the democratic vs monarchy governing systems, a princess who craves peaces and ends up as a tool to ignite war and these two boys, fighting on opposite sides, who share something very special. In it's future seasons, I want it to dig a little deeper, bring more light to the Aldnoah power and Vers - which is where it's unique. Very enjoyable storyline, but it can be better.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8.\\n\\n\r\nAldnoah Zero has a very appealing art style with detailed backgrounds, great character designs and tons of detail and colour. Where it falls short is the CGI, clunky mech designs which took me a LONG time to get use to. I had the same issue with Tokyo Ravens (the mech designs looking clunky and out of place) however I did warm up to them a bit but I did feel they took away from the rest of the art displayed in the series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6.\\n\\n\r\nI liked the characters but they were nothing new. Inaho is a stoic, calculated un-emotional genius, Slaine is a tragic, unrequited love type ruled by his emotions (rather, a singular emotion), etc.  The secondary characters are appealing, but not developed as well as they should have been. LT. Marito is the only one (of the secondary characters) who's character was really developed and I felt they still could have done more with them. A little more character development and adding some more layers to the main characters - to make them stand-out a little and have some depth, would enhance this aspect of the series. They were enjoyable characters, they just weren't unique or particularly well developed - the seed was planted and if they go the right direction during the second season, I think they can greatly improve on the characters next season.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nI haven't been this blown away by the sound of a series since Guilty Crown. The level of quality in EVERY single piece of music in this series was breathtaking - the openings, the endings, the soundtrack - were all godly in quality and I enjoyed every piece immensely. It added layers and layers to each scene, set the perfect mood before and after each episode and the music really stayed with me after I finished the series. 10/10 for music.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8. Though the series needs to dig deeper with it's characters and really focus on developing the characters naturally and further develop both the story and it's background, the series is very enjoyable with it's high action scenes, brilliant ost, beautiful art,  and appealing though not particularly unique characters. It needs to dig deeper with both it's characters and it's story, set itself further apart from the Gundam Series, which has already walked this road and really focus on bringing more attention to Vers and the Aldnoah Power - as that IS what sets this series apart and it's an interesting treat they are dangling and teasing but not digging into and I can't wait until they do.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8.",

It has a few tweaks that set the Martians up with super robots vs the Earths more real robot tech but Aldnoah.Zero is pretty much a bad Gundam clone. A lot of the plot decisions are contrived and someone should have said something about them while they were still in the planning stages of the show.\r\nThe characters all look like skinny little bitches but the machines and backgrounds look pretty good.  You can't really complain when it comes to the animation and all the motion looks pretty solid. No complaints.\r\nThe music score is amazing.At the end of the first episode it leaves you pretty hyped for the second. It makes this anime sound about 75% more epic than it actually is. I watched the sub before the dub came out and it sounded like a sub. I can't understand the words so I can't really describe the voice actors but they sounded normal.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters pretty much suck universally. They are either useless and single dimensional, stupid as fuck, or a crazy as motherfucker. It's one thing to have characters with human flaws, but its another thing entirely to have characters that are flawed because of bad writing.\\n\r\nKaizuka Inaho - This guy seems pretty cool at first.  He is a badass normal in a training suit. You would think this would make him interesting. The problem is that he is not only auto win against the Martians which destroys any form of tension that could happen--he is just about the only Earthling that is capable of fighting Martians. It is fucking stupid. This should be a pretty one sided war but somehow Earth is still holding on. Character development: N/A. His name should be Gary.\\n\r\nTroyard Slain - Slain is almost an interesting character. He is an Earthling that lives on Mars. This shouldn't really matter because Martians all came from Earth anyways but fuck logic, right? This dude has a tone of character development over the course of the show; he goes from whiny to batshit crazy. Normally this is the kind of character I can get behind but his motives and decisions are contrived. He is a poor attempt at a Char clone.\\n\r\nVers Allusia, Asseylum - AKA Dumb Bitch. She is based on the standard princess vying for peace mold that includes Marina Ismail and Lacus Clyne. Like the former and unlike the latter she also spends the entire show being absolutely useless, and even detrimental to her cause. There is no good reason that anyone should be crushing on a cockroach like her.\\n\\n\r\nAs you can probably tell, I did not particularly enjoy this show. I constantly hoped that  would win me back but it fails at every opportunity. The amazing score is wasted on trash like this. I would only recommend this if you are really good at ignoring the flaws in plot decisions.",

This is reminiscent of the Britannian empire being supposedly superior, watch'em Both as I tell no lie!\\n\r\n\u2022They both feature a beloved death\\n\r\n\u2022Both protagonists share a justifiable claim to their cause and the following states the character each mimics:\\n\r\nCode Geass                     aldnoah\\n\r\nSuzaku.                             Slaine\\n\r\nLelouch.                            Inaho\\n\r\nBut when it came to morals, these roles had become rather fluid.\\n\r\nIt was weird to see this interchangeable behaviour, but it probably came as a result of attempts to differentiate. So why is it such?\\n\r\nSo slaine had the technical superiority with the kataphrakts -basically, aldnoahs answer to create geass' knightmares- but lacked the strategic superiority imbued within inaho; both of which display similar odds to that of suzaku and lelouch in code Geass. Furthermore, is treated as a more honourary figure (again mirroring suzakus role) i.e. he is a  \u201cterran\u201d (name given to the earth-born) that was allowed to become a citizen of Vers, this honourary position had left Slaine open to discrimination by those that felt he was undeserving. \\n\r\nTo top things off, he ends up being in the control of a superior kataphrakt called tharsis of which had specs not dissimilar to code geass\u2019 suzaku's Lancelot knightmare-frame and they -suzaku and slaine- got through a series of rank promotions etc. Etc. \\n\r\nWhen I had said their morals were interchangeable, this becomes visible when we have know what the two protagonists' goals were; and here is where Slaine assumes the qualities of lelouch as in \u201che had a noble cause that, along the way, had deviated,\u201d but in this case the comparisons remains a little more ambiguous.\\n\r\nNow, I\u2019ve said a lot about Slaine's role, but how about Inaho's; in terms of position, he shares the fate as lelouch and had many adversaries and obstacles to overcome (which I will explore when explaining the anime itself... [Cue Yoda voice] \u2018so annoying, it was.\u2019). In regards to his goal it steered more towards selfish than noble as he found a girl that he likes and he tried taking out the guy who saved him to stop the girl that he likes from being taken away...\\n\r\nSPOILER ALERT\\n\r\nThat 'guy' was slaine, and he had a better thing going on with the girl in question anyways\\n\r\n___\\n\r\nBack to my main point, he had the same character style as lelouch also in the fact that he was primarily a strategist and also had the same \u2018pseudonym' \u2013 I say pseudonym, but in Inaho\u2019s case it was more of a nickname and the was Mustang 00, barely any different to lelouch's Zero.\\n\r\nOther than that, there was also the use of \u201cOrange\u201d as a sort of taunt and the fact that Inaho eventually got a special left eye that gave the terrain humans another advantage. \\n\r\nYet they still remained below the Martian humans in terms of technical superiority\\n\r\n...\\n\r\nOnto the anime itself, I can\u2019t say the storyline was great since it was imitation but I also cannot say it was bad as that wouldn\u2019t do code Geass justice, so for this I left it a 6/fair\\n\r\nI guess it was trying to make for some more lighter themed differences to code Geass as that pulled our heartstrings due to the deaths and made a poor attempt to reverse our anguish; so it effectively made an attempt to make the deaths meaningless, but forgot that death itself was the defining factor of our love for the anime.\\n\r\nHowever, the dissent built up is not about its similarities it had to code geass... It\u2019s nice to see someone riding the coat-tails of a great anime for a more similar attitude towards theirs. Because in hindsight they realise that it has backfired and will now become the butt if a joke for copying another anime\u2019s storyline, I bet the creator didn\u2019t even catch on to this as they may have felt that they\u2019ve created a sad story that must be rectified -i mean more often than not, it happens!\\n\r\nBut what ticked me off is that fact that to the creator, superior technology is not superior... Any ill-constructed plan can take them out. Why is it that the creator did not understand the fact that nobody goes into battle guns ablazing 'cause they gave superior technology, for some reason the Martian humans were passed Off as dumb as they couldn\u2019t comprehend the fact they got outwitted by the enemy coming straight at them. That\u2019s the anime in a nutshell.\\n\r\nAs for the art, it was body when it came to the characters e.g. their eye shape, but such shortcomings were only natural when dealing with anime/CGI blends; however, the CGI fight scenes were so action-packed whilst remaining ever so fluid, that it became the main reason why I continued watching both seasons and was inevitably let down\\n\r\nMost characters were known at face value and the only ones with the deepest construction were the two protagonists; that being said, they were just rip offs of lelouch and suzaku\u2019s so not all that great. They tried build up the supporting characters but it never worked and so they remained in the sides e.g. they attempted to build on a character suffering PTSD. It didn\u2019t work out.\\n\r\nOne thing\u2019s for certain. I did not enjoy that anime, I was too busy picking out what it had taken from code Geass\\n\r\n\u201cturned out to be a lot!\u201d\\n\r\nP.S.\\n\r\nFrom what I\u2019ve written, you can see that the anime did not have as much unique substance as it\u2019s substance was derived from code Geass.\\n\r\n___\\n\r\nHope you enjoyed what I wrote, and thanks for reading\\n",

Second season hits I was so hyped, and the first half was great since they showed both side's struggle, and their story lines are different: Inaholine is all fighting and Slaine line is political with fighting. Both storylines were great since it actually painted the background very well. But the ending... I guess the author just don't like his stories to have a logical, reasonable ending that's sweet and satisfies the audiences. The ending is as sh*tty as Guilty Crown, which is by the same author. That's all i gotta say.",

The humor, seriousness and drama are all well balanced. The overall character development and the characters themselves are great.\r\nEspecially with the main character. It's not that stereotypical hero who keeps yelling \"So you are the...\" or some other overused line. Because the show has very little hand-to-hand combat it makes sense that the main character can be superior because of his intelligence and quick thinking. That is exactly how he is. I alsolove how he never raises his voice. He has that calm voice all the way throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is great. I don't see any major flaws that would be disturbing. The soundtrack is perfect. Just listen to aLIEz... you can't go wrong with that!\\n\\n\r\nAll these points make the show enjoyable as hell and it is near perfect in its genre.\\n\r\nThe only thing that bugs me are some very short, minor points during the episodes. Without writing spoilers, one of them is the scene with the line \"You... are my enemy!\" right before aLIEz starts playing during the end credits. When you see this you might understand my point.\\n\r\nSome of his later comments don't go hand to hand with this logic and the choices he makes are weird. Even though I've rewatched the show, I still miss how that scene makes any sense whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nAldnoah.Zero is just perfect. Easily one of my favorites.",

Watch the anime atany volume and see if the music seems like the main focus during a fight compared to other anime. (I mean sometimes the music is louder than the actions happening during a fight or just covers up everything that spoils the experience of the scene )\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing I hate about the anime is that it has only 12 episodes and I felt they covered too much. Oh and also the fact that the final enemy had no unique power like the rest # annoyed.

Here, the martians are also inhabitants of Earth who left it a long time ago and return to take over it because of it's natural resources like air, water etc.\r\nIf you're expecting massive mecha action, fighting robots, superpowers, then that's not what you're gonna get.\r\nThe battles are mostly based on strategy where low class robots defeat elite class ones based purely on teamwork, strategies and exploiting weaknesses. There is very less brute action.\r\nThe character designs aren't one to droolover. I think the best character was of the protagonist. The others just look like plain old characters, no special design or anything.\\n\r\nI'm not saying this anime is bad, some episodes really get me pumped up but they are only a few. This anime was not worth all the hype created.\\n\r\nEven though I rated it 8, it's good and you won't feel like it was a waste of time to watch it but still there are tonnes of anime of the same genre that are much better than this.\\n\r\nI guess most of it is due to the incomplete ending of this season.\\n\r\nLet's see what happens in season 2. I've got a hunch it's going to get much better.",

Plot is pretty minimalistic, in every episode the MC faces another overpowered Martian mecha, which just chews through every ordinary, well-trained mecha pilot with their mechas like they were paperand then comes the MC to save the day with his orange training mecha. All the martian mechas have different abilities with which they fight the Earth mechas and the MC always figures out their weaknesses and just beats the crap out of them. And of course, in the last episode the \"Final Boss\" has the most epic Martian mecha seen in this season, which has all the abilities the previous mechas had and the MC of course beats him without even breaking a sweat.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are pretty shallow. The MC goes the whole season with his \"Iceman\" face in every episode. The martian princess goes on and on about friendship and magic and in the end blames herself for all that's happened although she was just a victim. The support characters are pretty bland are generic, not much to say. And then there's the boy from Earth, who somehow ended up on Mars, who was saved by the martian princess when they were little and who has a crush on her. The character itself seems fine, of course he wants to save the princess, but he is just so illogical and dumb in almost every episode he's featured in, it infuriates me. He's betrayed by the martians and still he fights by their side all the while sometimes aiding the MC and his gang. And in the end, he ends up shooting the MC for no reason whatsoever, just because he feels like doing so, or maybe it's because he's jealous of the MC, who has helped the princess throughout the season, while he's just sided with the people who tried to kill her, I don't know.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is nice, most of the tracks are great and go with the action very nicely.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is good, mechas and ships etc have lots of details to them and the action is good-looking and fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nSo at the end of the day, it's a good anime, with some flaws (mostly the one guy, who just makes no sense at all and makes you want the MC to just bash the he** out of him) but I'd still recommend it.",

            "content": "Gen Urobuchi, screenwriter/writer of shows such as Psycho-Pass, Fate/Zero and Madoka Magica shows his prowess once again in Aldnoah.Zero, which is honestly the best mecha anime I have ever seen. Over the course of the series I felt more and more immersed in the anime's story and characters, seeing them live their lives and seeing them change through the struggles they had been through. Likely the best part about this anime, though is the characters. Aldnoah is interesting in the sense that it gives us a main character on both sides of the conflict, each with differing views and motivation. On one side we haveInaho, the most calm mofo who ever lived (which is ironic because one of the characters he works with is named Calm) who always had the answers. Inaho was actually the most disappointing part of this anime, though, because of the point I made in the previous sentence: he always has the answer. He is the master strategist, and always seems to pull some sort of magical answer out of his ass. On the other side, however, we have Slaine. Slaine is probably my favorite character in this series because of how hilariously unlucky he is. Seriously, so many time, he just happened to get there a second too late or something, and that's what makes him such a good character, because he keeps on trying. This is the part where one would expect me to talk about the ending, so here we go. I didn't mind it. I actually liked it. At the point it was at I felt that I wouldn't have even minded if there wasn't a sequel. Anyway: sound. Sound was the only part of this anime that wasn't as good as the rest of it. I found a lot of the soundtrack to somewhat dull on its own, and some of it just didn't mix well with what was happening (I set fire). I can't really rate the voice acting, since I don't speak Japanese (I do hope it gets dubbed though). I enjoyed Aldnoah a great deal, and the only real flaws I can see are how stubbornly overpowered Inaho is and a few songs on the OST. Aldnoah.Zero tells a chilling tale of loss of innocence and tells of how to look at something from multiple angles, and I loved it. I give Aldnoah.Zero a 9/10\\n",

            "content": "The quality of the animation and the added CGI is a fine touch, however it wasn't enough to bring the cookie cut out characters and the overall same story for the mech genre out of the gutter. The main character is an easy cliche with the unnatural talent to pilot a practice mech and easily beat technologically superior enemies. The same goes for the undercover princess following around said main character as if he was her knight in shining armor (which technically is the point when it comes to most mech anime, but I digress).The worst part is that they showed much better character development in the side characters, while the main character shows the same monotone and bland feel throughout the entire series. A better choice for the main character would have probably been Koichiro Marito, an old tank pilot that survived the previous conflict with VERS who is suffering from PTSD, or Rayet Areash, a Earth born VERS who's father was a sleeper agent for the VERS empire. And the only comic relief to the series happened to be a slightly pervy side character with glasses. \\n\r\n       The good thing they managed to do is invoke a sense of helplessness and hatred toward the VERS empire in the beginning of the series and holds that feeling up until the very end, with the Martians constantly using rascist comments and biased way of handling situations, only to get their just desserts by being thrashed around by a teenager in a training mech.\\n\r\n       Overall the quality of the sound, art, music and CGI are absolutely spot on, however the series is riddled with speed bumps and hiccups that make you scratch your head thinking, \"What just happened?\". It's a fun anime however will leave with a feeling of frustration.\\n",

            "content": "Aldnoah.Zero is a glossed up Gundam rip off that unfortunately lacks heart. \r\nThat may sound harsh but as far as a one liner summary I think it best suits this series. Aldnoah.Zero is moderately entertaining and may even be a good entry level mecha for many. \r\nAldnoah.Zero's strong point is it's art style and visuals. The animation is well done, the mecha fights are some of the best out there, and I really enjoy the technical explanations and strategies that are given for many of the battles. The character designs were a little bland overall but they weren't bad by any means. \r\nThe music wasalso a treat and always fit the mood perfectly, often doing a solid job of getting you pumped up during the action sequences. All in all these elements are what pulled me in and kept me watching... \\n\\n\r\nThat said these elements can't do much to save what was overall a paint by numbers mecha story, that never evolved past it's initial ideas. With it's characters being as about as engaging as card board cut outs. \\n\\n\r\nThe paint by numbers part being the very Gundam setting.... where you have humans that are inferior, and humans that are superior, and they are fighting each other, and you have a space princess who wants peace, but can't seem to bring it about, and relies on an over skilled mecha pilot to act in her stead. That said pretty much every Gundam ever at least provides you with character development, and intrigue in regards to who is ultimately good or evil. Something that many other mecha series honestly put at the fore front in their tales. \\n\\n\r\nInaho our protagonist is an emotionally void genius. He watches his friends die with out batting an eye, and I think that's where this show absolutely failed. The protagonist ultimately was boring. There ultimately is no character development for him over the course of both seasons of this anime. You never learn his motives, you don't see him bond with any other characters, you don't watch him grow, you won't see him grapple with tough moral quandaries and there isn't a single challenge he can't seem to over come. \\n\\n\r\nThere is a sort of rival who in contrast does seem a lot more emotionally drive, but even his wishes and motives are incredibly one dimensional and he falters worse then any other character in the story. The rest of the cast is forgettable. Which is really unfortunate because there was a lot of room for meaningful bonds to be built and seeing characters talk about the issues of race, or of war and what causes it.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately the show is more or less eye candy, which yes can be entertaining, but in the end it will leave you unfulfilled.",

            "content": "Hmmmmm......Aldnoah. A story which is both comprised of an overused medium in anime and an old Latin phrase stating that the end justifies the means (correct me if I'm wrong). On the whole, Aldnoah.Zero is essentially little more than clickbait. The characters are shallow, if you can call them characters. The plot has nonsensical twists and turns. Also, the ending.....oh dear I don't want to discuss that (by the way, this review addresses both seasons). So, why the high rating? First, the rating is due mostly to one thing and one thing only, a J.J. Abrams style \"mystery box.\" I will address that later. Otherthan that, the plot was enjoyable, but as a work this fails on multiple accounts.\\n\\n\r\nStory (5/10) The premise: A civil war erupts between the two grinding class systems: the peaceful, defensive Terrans rushing to scramble war materials together against the bloodthirsty, cultist Versians; a Terran colony on Mars with superior technology left behind from an ancient race. Set in an alternate 2014, the aftereffects of the first Terran-Versian War still incur reeling effects for both societies: Mars is now more desperate than ever to acquire Earth as their territory due to squandered water supplies and starving masses, and Terrans are rushing to create Kataphrakts: mechas to counter the superior Versian fleet, now stranded in orbit over Earth due to the Moon-Vers \"mass-relay\" being destroyed in the past war. The plot progresses through the perspective of both sides: a young, Terran Kataphrakt trainee, Inaho Kaizuka, and a Terran subordinate to the Versian princess, Slaine Troyard. Both lives become intertwined when the silk-threaded cease-fire is shredded by the subsequent death of the peace-negotiating Versian princess within the first episode. Nice premise right! Well, kinda. Here's where it goes wrong. They fail on multiple accounts to properly set up the storyline. Why? The Terran-hating Versians aren't given a real, purposeful meaning behind their bloodlust other than greed and power. The Terrans don't really seem to give a damn about the Versians other than cowering in fear. As for a war depiction, there was no real setting for the environment. What I mean is the inevitable rationing; starving populus; injured/crowded hospitals; riots; martial law. Nothing. It just completely strays over this topic and hence fails to set the mood. On the Vers side, we see the exact same thing: no discussion of the populus, a dystopian-swayed happiness of the population to cheer on the war, no starving children, nothing. All we get from the Versians is the Royal family and part of the Versian fleet. That's as deep as the meaning of Vers will go. Quite frankly, it is a waste of a well-set premise.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10) I had no real problem with the art. I liked it because it was a nice, crisp feel for the entire setting. However, it never really stood out. The only thing that stood out were the opening animations, especially with the pan-over of the battle-torn moon, and the pandering view of the gun cutting to the motto: Let justice be done, though the Heavens' Fall. That was awesome and very memorable, yet thats as deep and meaningful as the art style goes, which is quite a shame.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10) The sound was quite a refreshment from the atrocities committed within this series. The background music fit well in the transitions of scenes: fight sequences, emotional acts, etc. The openings and endings both had a certain characteristic to them as the openings directly \"plunged\" you into the heat of the battle and the endings \"soothed\" you out of the episode. Probably my favorite ending was \"Aliez\" which every Aldnoah.Zero fan knows by heart by now.  This will probably be the highest rating I can give the show in terms of being unbiased, which I think many can agree with. If you find fault with the soundtrack, let me know on my profile, I'll readdress it and fix as necessary.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (3/10) *Pweh* *Spit* *cough* *hack* *vomit* Does that describe it in detail? If not I'll address each problem I have with it. The production company failed to address much of the war depiction. In fact, they failed to capture the entire war except the main characters. They hardly addressed the status of the war and its effects on the population, environment, morale, materials and resources, leaderships, nothing. If given a war, the above needs to be addressed. Because of this, the characters were severely underdeveloped. If the following conditions I listed above were the \"story\" of the battle, the characters lack the \"history\" or \"background\" to their portrayals. Subsequently, the voice actors/actresses had nothing to work with except a blank slate, essentially. Here, lets take the main characters. \\n\\n\r\nInaho Kaizuka, a robotic, duty-bound ex machina. If you would compare him to anyone, it would be Will Smith in After Earth. Both have a charismatic appeal, yet throw that away to play an emotionless, robotic role. \\n\\n\r\nSlain Troyard, a vengeful, confused ex machina. Slaine is abused because of his class system yet pulls the \"everyone falls under the wing of Big Brother\" cliche straight from 1984 and Psycho-Pass. His character had potential as a rival antagonist, yet only served as an ex machina and plot progression. \\n\\n\r\nPrincess Asselyum, a peaceful royalty who serves only to be kidnapped and the critical love interest connecting all three protagonists. She never had much development because she 1. lacked the \"history\" as I mentioned before, and 2. was absent for most of the series. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast is super forgettable. The bloodthirstiness/ cultist Versians are half-fueled for pursuing their religion in taking Terra because the King literally has no viewpoint on the subject. The terrans simply cower in fear. The show fails to capture every single aspect in developing character. Look at Psycho-pass. They captured the character roles of everyone: from the populus to the MC's perfectly. This show tries to do both and fails to capture both miserably. They even dragged poor Roronoa Zoro into a badly, underdeveloped role. WHYYYYYY?!?!?!?!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10) You probably double-taked when you saw the score didnt you? Yeah, I enjoyed it, alot. I hated the underdeveloped characters and the derailment of a plot; however, my attention was focused elsewhere: the J.J. Abrams academy of \"mystery boxes\" so to speak. If this doesnt make sense, think of Ryan Higa's videos......yeahhhhhh, you know where I'm going. I just want to say this, very few....I mean very few anime have an over-arching morale or theme. Whether it be One Piece, Psycho-Pass, or whatever.....these animes show a moral once, then its done. I mean, its hard to make a morale reoccur in a story more than once. Aldnoah Zero actually pulled this off not only once, but four times in their motto: Let Justice be Done, though the Heavens Fall. It reoccurs on a historical, mental, physical, and cultural aspect in this show....which quite frankly grabbed my attention. Let's explain. Heaven's Fall refers historically to the meteor shower which scarred the earth and killed millions...the effect of the mass relay going haywire and exploding most of the moon. This incident alone caused the Terrans fear and hatred towards the Versians, and vice versa. Thus, the cultural aspect applies how both cultures forge this idea of prevailing justice when all hell breaks loose; since both have a veritable reason for their ideas. Thus, Let Justice be Done, though the Heaven's Fall. Second, the physical aspect. The Earth is scarred by Heaven's Fall. When the Orbital Knights prepare a nuclear-beachhead Normandy act, it is shown as a Second Heaven's Fall....a nostalgia carving fear into the Terrans as they witness this act and reaffirming themselves to defend their beloved Terra. Third, mentality. As with the forged prevailing justice theme, most of the decisions made, aside from Kaizuka, is embracing this ideal. Self-sacrifice, for the greater good cliches were utilized throughout the show, which they did over-abundantly and made me consider the fact that these were brain-washed sheep duking it out instead of humans. Then it made me consider the fact that essentially it was. Heaven's Fall not only scarred Terra but humanity itself: creating a religion known as vengeful justice sweeping the minds of both the Versians and Terrans. The only non-applicants were Kaizuka and Asselyum, Asselyum only for the fact of the symbolic rebellion to the motto in the opening scene. Finally, the historical aspect. At the end of each show, it broadcasts this motto till the point you feel like an over-filled recycle bin. Each episode is set so that you can apply Let Justice be done though the Heavens fall as some sort of redeeming factor for the terrible plot decisions. So essentially, my favorite ex machina as of yet is \"Let Justice be Done, though the Heavens' Fall.\" Although repetitively done, I love it....its rare to see such a recurring factor.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7/10) This should be a 4/10 if it werent for Let Justice Be Done, though the Heavens' Fall. So, production team, take note. Yes, you succeeded in creating a \"good\" piece of work. However, only because of that motto. The rest is left to the uncalibrated charisma, Zoro clickbait, and wide-spread commercialization for this crappy work. The characters were awful, lovable but awful. It pulled off the \"Konoha Academy of underdeveloped side characters\" to a greater extent....leaving two entire populations undeveloped instead of five ninja clans. It tried the Shamalayan influence of arrhythmic plot progression and robotic main characters. The show itself was poorly done. Did I enjoy it? Yes, I did. I was addicted to it and plan to rewatch it. Was it good? awwww helll noooo! I can list ten off the top of my head with Studio Ghibli grade performances. Would I recommend this show to you? Yeah....unfortunately. I loved the recurring morale, so I would point out this show solely of that. It gets an A+ on that. However, I would compensate my horrible recommendation with ten better shows. Bottom line: this is my opinion and my opinion only. I wrote this so that all the Aldnoah fans out there can come to terms with the fact that this show wasnt that good. As an Aldnoah fan, I can enjoy a crappy work of art, however, it would be sinful for me to be ignorant on why its bad and exclaim that this was the best thing ever. So there.......Aldnoah fans. Feel free to leave your comment on my profile for how you thought I was wrong. I dont mind. Just dont be like Double4anime and proclaim Naruto as the best anime ever. I wont accept that.",

            "content": "When I get to the core of the matter, personally, Aldnoah.Zero is a pretty big dissapointment. That, of course, is not to say that it is a BAD anime, no. It's just with all the hype, the awesome teasers and just the whole potential of the story... it was just good. Just good. Is that a bad thing? No. But I do weep at what it could have been.\r\nAldnoah.Zero plot is where a huge amount of the lost potential lies. It's classic, cool sci-fi - an interplantery war between Mars and Earth, the planet under siege by Mech-armed Martian Knights hiding in an asteroid beltconsisting of the remnants of the Moon. What's not to love? The set up is great, and the whole first episode, despite a large amount of exposition, sets up what I hoped was a great anime.\\n\\n\r\nAnd... then it just kind of lost it's footing. The story never got bad, but it never really got anywhere. Many moments of the storyline feel quite cheap or pointless, occurring merely due to a whim or just plain luck. My biggest problem with the plot is how the entire first season of this show is made utterly pointless by the actions of the antagonist. None of the Terran character's actions really amount to anything by the end of season 1, and that really drives home my disappointment with the show.\\n\\n\r\nThough, I must say, the directing and atmosphere of the final scene of the season was almost universally brilliant. The scene was incredibly well done and hit home the more realistic and grounded feel of the show that was felt in it's earlier episodes. It's a shame that this wonderful scene is butchered by the second season, but that's a review for another day.\\n\\n\r\nOn a more positve note, this show show it's strong cards when it comes to the Mecha action - yes, the mechs are CG, but it didn't feel TOO jarring when it comes head-to-head with the traditional animation of the rest of the show.  The Martian Knight's Mecha are all pretty damn cool in their own right, ranging essentially mobile disinergration tanks to wielding plasma weapons to one which is literally armed with half a dozen robotic fists. The fights are great fun and are without a doubt a highlight of the show.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the traditional art of the show, it's very solid and very nice to look at. The character designs are very nice, and I rather like how normal the main characters look - it gives a good indication of how it really is just a whole bunch of normal people getting swept up into this giant war. Characterisation-wise, I only really like a few of the characters, mostly Slaine and the Princess of Vers, because those two were the only ones who got major development. I wasn't too fond of Inaho - I liked how he used his brain to get his way through situations, but the fact he had next to no development until endgame and had the personality of a box of eggs really soured me on the character.\\n\\n\r\nWithout a doubt, though, the audio and music of the show is incredible. Featuring the composer behind Kill la Kill and Guilty Crown, the soundtrack to this anime is just nothing short of perfect. Every track fits it's scene and it just hits the right notes at the exact right moment. On that note, the audio for the mech fights are also very well on point, giving the fights a feeling of impact and weight.\\n\\n\r\nI say it again - Aldnoah.Zero is not a bad show - the sum of it's parts makes it enjoyable. However, it squandered almost all of it's potential with the plot almost being pointless in the end and next to no development or even personality for the main character. I enjoyed the show for it's incredible soundtrack and great fights, but otherwise it's just average in other respects. I really wish I could just love this show more then just liking, but you can't love everything. Now, when it comes to season 2... that's a whole different story.",

Ive seen both seasons and they are equally as good. The main character is not someone you see as a hero of an anime, he is more reserved and never really shows any emotion. When he gets into the pilot seat of a mech he changes into some badass that analyzes everthing in front of him. This kind of reminded me of watching code geass back in the day when he would just sit in back and think everything throughdown to the very detail. The concept of another human species living on mars and attacking earth is quite interesting to me. The fact that they have better mechs then the eathlings is nothing to bat an eye at. The earth people seem to have better piolots though. The mars people are shown to be arrogant and thinking they are better then their earth counterparts. Overall this was one of my favorite animes of last season I would recommend if you like exciting supernatural stories. It is very one of a kind.",

While it may start slow for the first 2 or 3 episodes, once it picked up I could not stop watching, and I watched the entire season in almost one day, and have rewatched it many times as well. While I will avoid spoilers, I must say the the ending has honestly changed the way I veiw ending of shows. It is a powerful ending that will leave you thinking for the next week. \r\nThe characters in this show are beautifull written, as the show progresses you can't help but sympathize with Slaine, and I don't know how youcould possibly dislike Asseylum. Even the smaller characters like Inko and Calm you can't help but love. Some of my favorite parts of the show are when you get to see into a softer side of Inaho, overall the characters are all around all very great, even Saazbaum has a side of him that you can sympatize with. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound track is also something that stands out to me, and something that I have listened to a ton. Whether it's the opening, \"Heavenly Blue,\" or \"Keep on Keeping On,\" the songs are all memorable and amazing. Plus I'm pretty sure anyone who has watched this show has gotten \"aLIEz\" stuck in their head at some point.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is a show that I believe everyone should watch, and while I am on the fence about season 2 so far, Season 1 is a must watch.",

            "content": "When a group of great minds get together to make an anime, you expect a lot and you\u2019re right to do so. After all, a Gen Urobuchi anime with Hiroyuki Sawano composing the music (Kill la Kill, Attack on Titan) and A-1 Pictures doing the animation can most definitely not be bad, can it? It\u2019s a dream collaboration and I was pretty excited when it was announced, and much less excited now that the first season is over. Before you start typing up your angry comments about whatever it is you\u2019re angry about, allow me to spend the rest of this review telling you whyAldnoah.Zero is a slightly above average anime rather than the great anime it should have been.\\n\\n\r\nMars has been colonized and the humans who did so have taken on an identity of their own. There\u2019s royalty on Mars, and an especially adorable princess who comes to Earth to offer peace after tensions between the two groups has been at a high point. During a parade, she is supposedly assassinated by Terrans (Earthlings) and the Vers (Martians) send their giant robots powered by Aldnoah drives down to Earth to kill every one. They start by driving their landing ships into major cities, causing nuclear-level destruction. My biggest problem with this is that the scale of the attacks is pretty well done until the only city in the United States that\u2019s shown getting destroyed is New Orleans. Because when I think strategic strike-zones in America, I think of a place where everyone\u2019s either too intoxicated to handle themselves or too busy working on rebuilding after another disaster struck\u2026\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, the Princess isn\u2019t really dead and depends on a group of Japanese high school students being trained in the art of giant robot warfare to protect her. They fight against a gauntlet of various robots from a splinter group of the Vers military called the Orbital Knights who just want to destroy Earth because we have a hell of a lot better ecology than Mars. And that\u2019s about the extent of your plot.\\n\\n\r\n The series goes from one major robot fight to the next so moves at a decent clip for the most part. There\u2019s some time spent with characters getting built up and that would work if there were characters worth caring about. Our protagonist, Inaho, is Lelouch from Code Geass. He\u2019s cold, calculating, doesn\u2019t really show much emotion. Maybe a better fit would be a completely boring Sora from No Game No Life. His uncaring attitude and ability to pull wins from his ass against opponents much better equipped is, for lack of a better word, boring.\\n\\n\r\nPrincess Asseylum is another boring character. Cute to look at and cute in personality, while also being the goody-goody ideological spew-a-bunch-of-life-lessons-about-caring-and-friendship character.\\n\\n\r\nRayet\u2019s my favorite character if only because she\u2019s a copy and pasted Kyoko Sakura*. A tsundere with dead parents? Denim booty shorts, a jacket, and boots? She differs from Kyoko in plot but for the most part the characters could be twins when put side to side.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a lot of other characters not even worth mentioning. They\u2019re there. That\u2019s about all I can give them.\\n\\n\r\nFor an Urobuchi anime it manages to be pretty tame but for one scene partway through (involving a shower, and about the only scene I\u2019ll ever remember from the show) and the ending. Speaking of the ending, it definitely leaves things open for the upcoming second season but was very abrupt. A great cliffhanger but man did it come out of nowhere.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is alright. I felt that the pop-ish soundtrack didn\u2019t fit with the usually gritty or dark story. Pop soundtracks do not go well with war scenes. But the ending is pretty good, I\u2019ll give it that.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is excellent and aside from the robots sometimes looking crummy due to being computer generated, I was more impressed with this aspect then anything else.\\n\\n\r\nWhy are they using giant robots to fight human infantry? Has Earth not trained it\u2019s defense forces in ground combat without robots? How come a Humvee can withstand a rocket launcher blast head on yet a single anti-aircraft round can blow a giant robot in half? Why didn\u2019t I get to see tits in the shower scene? And how come Marito\u2019s flashbacks to the first landing of a Martian robot remind me so much of Misato\u2019s flashbacks to the First Impact.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s not the best written anime and has a lot of questions dangling about, but it will appeal to Gen\u2019s fanbase. Get ready for despair, death, heavy drinking, flashbacks, a person killing their best friend, blank eyes, murder, dead parents, betrayal, loli, guns, and a scene only written for the express purpose of fans to make lesbian porn out of it.\\n\\n\r\nAldnoah.Zero is not the best anime out there, but it\u2019s really not too bad. It\u2019s entertaining to a point and does have some good human drama. But the fights scenes aren\u2019t too memorable, the characters are all flat, the music isn\u2019t great, and the story is nothing that hasn\u2019t been done before. It\u2019s a decent distraction, but it won\u2019t be anything remembered beyond its airing.",

Not that I'm a big fan of this type of anime, but the fact that I saw des Code Geass, some years ago I started to give them opportunities for this type of anime.\r\nAldnoah.Zero is an anime in which each chapter there are battles between robots, there is no chapter that has no battles or explosions. This fact is appreciated and you always have a bit of action in each chapter. The anime itself is somewhat predictable in parts, but without removing the voltage will happen withthat character.\\n\\n\r\nAldonoah.Zero is based on an alien story, where a few years ago mankind decided to settle on Mars (Vers) and start a colony. On Mars, a magical and mysterious technology called Aldnoah was discovered. This technology was absorbed by the current emperor of the world, who have the luxury to dominate and divide at will the Aldnoah also that Aldnoah is transmitted from generation to generation through the actual genes.\\n\\n\r\nThat is the beginning of history, and as we anticipate, the Mars are tired of your planet, a planet that can not be exploited, so the intention is to invade the Earth and to exploit the planet's resources. Obviously humans will find it difficult to beat this planet. To others that Mars has internal problems: those who are faithful to the emperor and Orbital Gentlemen, gentlemen with the sole purpose of starting a war.\\n\\n\r\nAs on Earth, we will have one of our players, Inaho Kaiduka, teenager, and has a gift controlling test robots (orange), a leading: quiet, with a strategic and very smart gift.\\n\r\nMoreover, we Troyard Slaine, a terrarium character but lives on Mars and is very attached to the Princess Asseylum Vers Allusia, princess who is involved in this war. Slaine's character will make you love him or hate him. If you have not seen Aldnoha.Zero I recommend to watch out well in Slaine.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCertainly a fairly recent picture I recommend if you like anime mecha, especially if you like explosions, the animation is quite interesting and good, since the robots are 3D. The anime has 2 seasons: Aldnoah.Zero Aldnoah.Zero and 2, both of 12 episodes each, which I can not tell you like both, because the first really finished and I had to quickly move to the second state tension in which I left.\\n\\n\r\nReview in spanish: http://ramenfreaks.blogspot.com.es/2015/05/hablemos-de-aldnoahzero.html",

There is very less brute action.\r\nThe character designs aren't one to droolover. I think the best character was of the protagonist. The others just look like plain old characters, no special design or anything.\\n\r\nI'm not saying this anime is bad, some episodes really get me pumped up but they are only a few.

            "content": "When you read the synopsis on this anime and you look at the pictures used to promote this anime, you're probably thinking, \"What the hell am I getting myself into with this?\"\r\nMost people that I know that watch this, and by most people I mean about 4, don't really like this anime for a variety of reasons.\r\nOnce again, I'll offer my own opinion of this show as objectively as I possibly can...I hope\r\nStory: 6\r\nRight off the bat within the first 3 min. of the first episode, we're introduced to Slaine and the Princess of Mars, Vers Allusia, Asseylum. The plot itself is already intriguing dueto how Slaine is treated and the supposed relations between Earth and Mars; they've got the setup on point and it honestly left me wanting for more. The premise, setting and concept of the plot is great; fantastic way to start off the show.\\n\\n\r\nAfter the first episode is where the problems start to come in. For the first few episodes, the people of Earth are being completely dominated; it's not even a close fight, then behold! It's Deus Ex Machina coming to save the day...sigh*. I'll save that for character.\\n\\n\r\nAs the story progresses, we're introduced to what Aldnoah really is and who discovered it which actually made Slaine more interesting than any other character in this show (More on that later). We're also told what exactly caused the temporary peace between the 2 planets, then we're shown what exactly dispelled the peace between the planets and their motivation for disrupting the peace; all that is really interesting...except...\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion, there wasn't enough concrete world building; most of the lore in this world would require you to use your own head-canon, which isn't good at all. They briefly talk about the origins of the Vers Empire, we have 0 explanation on the origins of the Martians themselves. The Aldnoah has a reasonable amount of explanation, but I would've preferred some more context to the point where it can be comprehended. There are some other things too, but I can't say it off the top of my head; it's easier to watch than explain.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the concepts at play are fantastic and this show started off the best way possible, possibly the best first episode of any anime I've seen. After that, it falls apart by the lack of world-building and explanations to some extent. For a universe that's supposed to be heavy on lore, world-building and interesting history (like Mass Effect), it's certainly lacking. The main character is also a detriment to the story, not because he's OP, but because he has ZERO reason to be OP in the first place; it's actually on Kirito levels of OP, maybe more so, especially in the 2nd season.\\n\r\nIt's not a bad story; actually, I'd say the story is good, possibly very good; it's just the lack of world-building and lore weaken the story as a whole\\n\\n\r\nArt/Action: 8\\n\r\nNow...this anime features a lot CGI animation, and most anime fans would agree that trying to do animation in this style has usually been failures on all anime that's tried. In this case, it's actually good animation.\\n\\n\r\nThe art of the mechs (Kataphrakt) and their animations actually fit the style of the show along with blending with the atmosphere that covers the show. I would say it's reminiscent of Gundam; not even close to the style of Gundam or quality, but it's still good quality in my opinion. They made sure they used their animation budget accordingly, and in the end, it paid off\\n\r\nThe rest of the animation is still good quality, although there are scenes where the animation looks like shit, but what anime has 100% flawless animation? It's pretty consistent animation for the humans and Martians, so it still works out.\\n\\n\r\nThe actions scenes really reminded me of Gundam, only CGI. The fights are honestly pretty cool to look at, even though a lot of them are short-lived due to the inferior tech the people of Earth have. Really good fight scenes overall.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nNot much to say here; the OST for this show is absolutely fantastic, and is absolutely worth your time. As I usually say, give it a listen; you won't regret it...I hope.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5\\n\r\nI'm saving Slaine for 2nd season; I have a lot to say about this character\\n\\n\r\nPrincess Asseylum Vers Allusia in this season is a very one note character. She has absolutely no depth to her character other than her relationship with Slaine compared to how the others treat him; that's the only thing keeping her interesting in this show.\\n\\n\r\nKouichirou, Marito is the only character other than Slaine that has any actual character. It's mostly shown through flash-backs his experience with the previous war he was a part of. In present time, he's constantly going through therapy in order to recover from his PTSD so he can keep fighting in the current war, making him one of the more realistic characters in this show, and I appreciate what they did with him; he's severely underrated.\\n\\n\r\nKaizuka, Inaho is the Deus Ex Machina of the show and they don't give an explanation for this other than he's the top student of his class...with that aside...\\n\r\nHe is a worse version of Tatsuya, meaning he rarely shows any emotions, super analytical in any combat situation, and every situation works for him; though the same can be said for Tatsuya, although he had a good reason to be super OP in the first place. Inaho uses a training model mech as his personal unit which is absolutely insane; if this was their way of trying to nerf him, they failed; in fact, this makes him look even more OP. In short, he has the bare essentials of a character with no layers applied to him whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nMany of the other characters have absolutely no depth to their character at all, and I've nothing else to say here.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nI might be the odd man out when it comes to this but I really enjoyed this show despite the blatant flaws. My favorite thing about this show was definitely Slaine. He is the most interesting and the best character in this show and there's no debating that. Fight scenes were entertaining despite the Deus Ex Machina factor, and the story kept me entertained the whole way through.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\r\nThe story is actually really good, but the lore around the story is very lacking and hinders it significantly. The art, animation and CGI scenes were actually cool to look at; not the best, but still good. OST is fantastic like always. Characters are definitely lacking in this show with 2, maybe 3, exceptions.\\n\\n\r\nI would say watch this show at least once, then immediately jump to 2nd season. It's worth at least one watch.",

            "content": "Ok, so I saw some pretty harsh reviews for this show so felt the need to add my two cents.  I will be VERY clear however, my review is for SEASON 1 ONLY....\r\nHaving said that I want to touch on a few things...\r\nStory:\r\nThe story was both outstanding and frustrating at the same time.  For the most part I thought it was great, but I say frustrating because there were a few things I had to overlook.  \r\nOne of those was the amount of time the Vers or Martians or whatever had been been broken away into their own ..well I'll call itspecies for lack of a better term.  If you'd told me this had been like...oh say a couple of centuries or something...GREAT, makes sense.  HOWEVER, unless I completely heard this wrong, it was more like 50 years or something....that to me is a MAJOR problem. The story makes mention of culture and they view each other as VERY different....yet 50 years is not even close to long enough for that mentality to develop and for true culture to be built up....hell it's not long enough for them to develop these astonishing floating ship/cities....so hopefully I misheard and that bad is on me...but I thought that's what it said, which is just dumb, so to help me get past all that I just pretended they said something like 250 years and after that I really enjoyed the story. :D\\n\\n\r\nMy second issue is what takes place near the end of the story, but I'm not even sure if you just count that as character flaws, story issues, or just the fact that this story continues...so my concerns over the final episode or two I will actually skip over and address those in my Season 2 review....and see if they redeem those questionable moments or not.\\n\\n\r\nHaving said that...the rest of the story to me was great.  I loved the concept, it kept me very interested and I thought it was well laid out (aside from the two items i mentioned above).  Again though....I was very thrilled to find this as so many anime are just shallow, so it was nice to have a story with some serious concepts and meat to it.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nBEAUTIFUL anime....nothing more to say.  I literally thought multiple times when watching it...man this is really beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nWon't go into detail yet here, but I'll just say for what you know in Season 1 only, the characters are great.  They could TOTALLY ruin that depending on what they do in the Season 2 though, as there is definitely some explaining to do.  It could really redeem some moments from S1 or could make you say WTF were they thinking....but with it ending before revealing that, I can't honestly knock points off for that just yet....  \\n\\n\r\nAside from that, I really enjoyed the characters...  I like the main char and his sister's relationship.  I loved how he was socially awkward.  I thought his friends and the PTSD teacher were great....  The princess was ok, but I really liked Slaine and his interactions with the other Counts...made it very interesting and gripping to me.  Overall I thought the chars were well done.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment / Overall:\\n\r\nIf you like Mecha, military, just really beautiful anime...and want something with a little more mature, meaty storyline I think you'll really enjoy this.  I love this kind of story, one with real consequences, political plays, and I really like military stuff as well...so this was highly enjoyable to me.  I didn't think the Mecha was overdone (as that's not really my thing but I thought it was balanced well).  I highly suggest anyone looking for something along those lines to check this out, I think you'll find it worth your time.  I will add however, this is not a start/end story.....it has another season (and season 2 may be a MAJOR let-down depending on how they handle some items), so I would also warn folks not to watch this if you want a wrapped up story at the end....but if you're ok going along for the ride and enjoying it for what it is...part 1 of a series....this is really a truly great anime.",

            "content": "Ah, the controversial Aldnoah.Zero...This really is another one of those love or hate animes depending on how you like or dislike the characters.  Personally, I really enjoyed it and would recommend to any mecha fans who like a huge slice of melodrama and scheming in the same vein as Code Geass.  It aims for an epic, sweeping tragedy where misunderstandings, jealousy, clashing personalities, and revenge drive all the protagonists to push the plot through a spiral of conflict.  It mostly succeeds, although there are a number of issues that prevent this from really being a masterpiece and leave it floundering in \"prettygood\" territory.\\n\\n\r\n[Story] 7/10 - The set-up, inter-planetary war between Earth and Vers (Mars) where Vers have a clear advantage in technology but Earth has..well..luck and pluck maybe?  There's a nice history for the background where there has been a state of \"cold war\" between the two sides but now things have kicked off again.  Earth is prepared this time and the Martians (who are just Earth ex-pats who created a noble caste system on Mars) have lost their previous edge due to infighting and sitting on their arses for decades.  So it is that the war begins anew and provides a scene for our melodrama to unfold.  This, the first cour, begins with a sort of mecha of the week to defeat approach, all to showcase the MC Inaho's incredible tactical savvy.  There are twists along the way and personal dramas of friends lost or imperilled but essentially it is all to build up the development of the lead characters Inaho, Asseylum, and Slaine Troyard.  The plot develops to be about Slaine and Inaho fighting over Asseylum really with the parallel plot of Earth's survival.  Despite the involvement of Gen \"The Butcher\" Urobuchi (writer) early on, it never quite overcomes being a bit over-clever and self-congratulatory in places but occasionally there are moments of epic misunderstanding and Shakespearean-like tragedy that are really satisfying, albeit..well..tragic.  The ending is particularly great, and there is such a payoff of angst and emotion that you cannot help but marvel at how mature the writers were with the plot, despite hiccups along the way.  Pacing is really nice, with action and drama at full tilt with occasional pauses to catch your breath.\\n\\n\r\n[Art] 8/10 - The animation is mostly very good.  Design is solid, with mechs looking awesome and characters pretty well done.  The colour palette is thematic and evocative with Earth scenes having a vibrant blue and green, where the Vers ones more stark or over-saturated with splendid golds and crimsons reflective of their habit of fa\u00e7ade.  Animation is mostly very fluid and the mecha fights are nice to watch and a great effort by A1 Pictures.  There are some drops in quality\\n\\n\r\n[Sound] 9/10 - I loved the music from start to finish.  Hiroyuki Sawano is one of my favourite composers for this kind of thing, and his threatening and majestic scores really elevate this anime.  For some they seem a bit repetitive but they create an epic quality that underpins the scenes in Aldnoah.Zero.  As OPs and EDs go, they are all catchy and top notch, however special mention does go to aLIEz because it is brilliant.  The voice acting is also pretty solid and portrays the characters with skill, yes Inaho is a bit flat but that's kinda his thing right?\\n\\n\r\n[Character] 7/10 - You may well love or hate this anime solely based on your appreciation of the main characters.  Firstly, Inaho the MC is emotionally repressed and analytical in the extreme.  He is not without emotion but doesn't show it very much and really only comes to life when he's solving problems, i.e. beating the enemy.  I really liked his understated personality, being mostly calm and quiet except when he's protecting his sis or Asseylum.  He may be deep and thoughtful...calm waters run deep.  Or, you may hate him for the emotionless plot device some see him as.  Slaine Troyard, is by contrast, more emotional and driven by this emotion.  He's also rather illogical at times and self-serving, albeit with good intentions.  Slaine is a great and tragic character, wronged by so many and misunderstood.  He is still a total dick, but a well written total dick.  Asseylum is..well..she's quite disappointing really.  Asseylum is a trope and it's puzzling that these two strong and different characters are fighting over her.  She could have really made this anime amazing if she was more than a peace-loving plot waifu.  I'd have really liked to see her as having drive and agency equal or exceeding the other two.  Supporting characters are all nice, albeit underdeveloped.  They just seem to be spectators for the unfolding tragedy.  Count Saazbaum is a brilliant and layered character though and provides a bit of gristle as a sort of villain.  The other Orbital Knights are mostly pointless.\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment] 9/10 - For me, I loved this series.  It was fun and dramatic and I never got bored.  I could forgive it's misfires as the pace took me along for a great roller-coaster ride of feels.\\n\\n\r\n[Overall] 8/10 - Aldnoah.Zero is one of those shows that will always have some fans.  It has great dramatic plot, amazing scenes in places, and emotional pay-off for the viewer.  It does have some WTF moments too, both good and bad, and plot holes you could fly a landing castle through.  However, ultimately I would recommend this to fans of mecha and drama as it's relatively slick and very very well delivered.",

            "content": "It\u2019s been three years since the first season of \u201cAldnoah.Zero\u201d aired. Having not been made aware of the series until several weeks ago, I decided to jump in with a fresh perspective, free from the hype that had surrounded it during its release.\r\nI have given this show a score of 8, which to many people, may seem like a ridiculously high score for a show that is supposedly one of the greatest disappointments of the 2014 anime season.\r\nThe first season of \u201cAldnoah.Zero\u201d is a standard mecha anime series that makes up for its lack of originality with its ability to make you wantto see more. Some reviewers have likened this show to trainwrecks like the infamous \u201cGuilty Crown,\u201d criticizing its poorly conceived characters and overall lack of depth. Others have mentioned that this show is another example of \u201cstyle over substance,\u201d claiming that the story was forsaken for the sake of grand nonsensical action sequences.\\n\\n\r\nBut here are my own thoughts, some of which don\u2019t necessarily agree with the opinions held by many others.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\n\u201cAldnoah.Zero\u201d tells the story of a war between Earth and Mars (known as Vers) after an assassination attempt is made on the Versian princess during her peaceful visit to Earth. It\u2019s a setup that isn\u2019t all that interesting or special, but enough to get the story going.\\n\\n\r\nWe are introduced to Inaho, who is a teenage tactical prodigy that manages to help fight the overwhelming Martian forces with his wit and talent. His sheer audacity and plans help turn the tide against the invaders. He and his friends must now escort the Martian princess to safety in hopes of ending the war between their planet and Mars.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s not that special of a story, but it\u2019s not that bad of one either. If you like franchises like Gundam, you\u2019ll probably find something to like in this series as well. It\u2019s nowhere as good as Gundam, but it\u2019s worth one\u2019s watch.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nThe animation is clean and flawless. Although I usually criticize shows for using too much CGI, \u201cAldnoah.Zero\u201d uses the technology extremely well. Not once did I ever feel that its usage was out of place.\\n\\n\r\nFight scenes are choreographed extremely well, characters are consistently drawn in terms of quality, and the overall design is nothing short of amazing.\\n\\n\r\nThe show\u2019s animation is where it shines.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nFor sound, I want to focus on the music. Hiroyuki Sawano\u2019s composing never fails to disappoint, so I am pleased to say that his music helps elevate the experience. Without him, the dramatic moments in the show would not have as great of an impact. \\n\\n\r\nSome people may disagree, but I found that the opening song for the series, \u201cheavenly blue,\u201d may be one of the best opening songs. I have never skipped through it while I was watching the show. It is one of those songs that makes you feel excited. The entire song, if I have to summarize it in one word, would be \u201cdramatic\u201d.I\u2019ve never been able to articulate my feelings in regards to music too well, so my own suggestion for you is to simply listen to it. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nFor the most part, the show manages to create likable characters. However, likable does not equate to good characters. For instance, we have our main protagonist, Inaho, who is so plain and lacks any recognizable characteristic other than his unusual talent for recognizing how to destroy supposedly unstoppable Martian machines. I like cool-headed protagonists as much as the next guy, but Inaho literally lacks any personality or emotion. \\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, the second protagonist, Slaine, manages to steal the show. He may actually be one of the only characters in the show that develops in any way. Unlike most of the characters on the Earth side, Slaine is a compelling character who I was more excited to watch than anyone else on the show. It escapes me as to why Slaine was not the main focus of the series. He was perhaps the only character I truly felt for.\\n\\n\r\nBut as I mentioned before, the show has likable characters. And although they aren\u2019t particularly strongly written ones, they were ones that I enjoyed watching whenever they came on the screen. I just wished that they were given more depth in order for viewers to truly come to emphasize with them.\\n\\n\r\nOh and I suppose some people might say that Lieutenant Marito is a character who is given a lot of depth, but to be honest, the series would have been more or less the same without him. It\u2019s a shame that the work put into his story wasn\u2019t put into another character\u2019s instead.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyability:\\n\r\nI enjoyed it for what it was. It doesn't have the best characters or story, but it did have some genuinely exciting and dramatic moments. \"Aldnoah.Zero\" is probably not an anime that I will remember in the far future, but one that I will think fondly of if I ever come across it again in the future.\\n\\n\r\nIt gets a 8 from me because it was highly enjoyable. It's not the best mecha anime out there, but it is definitely one that I wouldn't mind seeing again.\\n\\n",

(They do point out that the Martians are originally FROM Earth, but that apparently doesn't stop the prejudice.)  While I'm a fan of robots fighting in space, there's nothing new that this anime offers.  \r\nSeason two of this anime really got my attention.You start seeing some really good things happen in season two.  \\n\\n\r\n-Art-\\n\\n\r\nArt was pretty good, the only reason why I gave it a 6 was because of the bad CG utilized for the mechs.\\n\\n\r\n-Sound-\\n\\n\r\nIt was all right.

The only reason why I'd give it an 8 is because Slaine Troyard's character growth is really, really good.  \\n\\n\r\nI find Inaho Kaizuka  little interesting.  He's rather expressionless and practical for a main character and doesn't really evolve much throughout the series, unlike Slaine.  \\n\\n\r\nI found Elysium rather typical.  There's really nothing special about her from your usual princess.  It looked like she had much more to offer to the series, though.",

            "content": "\"Let justice be done, though the heaven falls\"\r\nAfter you saw my overall mark you grinned, i am right? That's because the average point for this title is 4-5. I still admit this desicion, but i'll try to explain you why i really enjoyed this title.\r\n   -Story- (7/10)\r\nOk, let's start from prehistory. Story takes places in future, when people found a hypergate on the moon, which can teleport them to Mars, where they discovered a new and very powerful technology called \"Aldnoah\". After people divided on 2 races: \"Vers Empire\" and \"Terrans\".  Aldnoah let martians win every battle between this two empires. Itmade stupid arrogants from them. They divided their popularity to typical townsfolks and knights, which wxactly was fighting with Terrans. The idea is a little bit innovative, but somehow A-1 managed not to show us this universe in details. Title was narrowly directed to charecters, main developments etc, but they also managed to f*ck up them also. And yeah, if you think, that schoolboy can't destroy best fighters in closest universe on educational robot - don't watch it.\\n\r\n   -Art- (10/10)\\n\r\nI think it isn't important to talk a lot about it. The art is awesome, seriously. Detailed trivias, pleasant colors, everything as I love. \\n\r\n   -Sound- (10/10)\\n\r\nSame as art. This two options place this title to one of the most beautiful animes ever. Sawano Hiroyuki had done her best, cool OST's, and individual respect for aLIEz, one of the best anime ED's ever heard. \\n\r\n   -Character- (6/10)\\n\r\nThis title consists from faceless cliche characters, but I can distinguish some good ones. Let's start from main character, Inaho. Authors tried to make a kudere genius, but we got a biorobot without any motivation. On his useless robot he was kicking martian's asses ALL the way, that's all he've done. Only in last anime scene we could see a part of his emotions, but that scene was really awesome, +1 to overall mark (no). Our Vers princess is also like a doll in a puppet show. She had only one feature - kindness. That's all. Only one hero I enjoyed was Slaine. He had motivation, his every move was logical, and i was sympathy all the way. And from antagonists only one character was motivated - Saazbaum. \\n\r\n   -Enjoyment- (8/10)\\n\r\nAnd yeah, i understand, that objectively this title is average / bad, but a little  stupid kid inside me eating everything have been got. Anyway, i enjoyed it, but if u are watching for a masterpiece miss this title, please. \\n\r\n   -Overall- (6/10)\\n\r\nSooo, ok. If there were bad art and average soundtracks it could be 5(4)/10, but that things are awesome, so title is getting watched very easy and nicely. \\n\\n\r\nAnyway, thanks to reading it, i'll try to write something else soon.",

            "content": "So finally I find a mecha show on crunchyroll since Gargantia left me wishing for a true quality mecha show. After much searching and hoping, I finally get to ALDNOAH ZERO. It was interesting and clever with the whole Mars versus Earth thing and I like how it's no grand mystery to be revealed later what the villains motives are. I love the design differences between vers and terran mecha. The thing I love the most is the main character, Inaho. He's not the gung ho over the top bad ass shouting his moves while screaming about justice and friendship in between asking just whothe hell do you think I am. Nor does he whine and/or cry about his particular lot in life. The art is slick and smooth throughout, and the character designs are splendid. It told a great story that did a fantastic job of explaining why we can just radio for help.\\n\r\nBut, there's lot's to anti-like here, starting with the number of cliches. inadvertent hero? Check. Person turned against their own kind? Check. Princess? Check. Princess' over protective guardian? Check. Character with unrequited love for hero? Check. Villain betrayed by fellow villains? Check. Sole person who knows the truth about the past? Check. Person with improbable ties to hidden past? Check. But the coup de grace is the following question:\\n\r\n [spoiler]\\n\r\nWHAT ARE THESE ORBITAL KNIGHTS INCOMPETENT?! If my mecha cannot fly on it's own, why would you walk across a bridge? I'd only need TNT to escape. The guy with the plasma sword? One would think you'd research such things on a planet that's >70% water? The girl with the flying arms? What does she do when faced with more than six targets? Their inability to kill high school kids really blows my mind! And then there's the end...which was cool, I loved it, and thought here comes a five; until the last ten seconds. More coming January 2015!?! what more? You killed off the only character who wasn't a walking cliche and no other character was interesting or dynamic enough to justify seeing the further adventures of.\\n\r\nAll and all I had a good time with this and it's great for those who want mecha without Camille Bidan, or Shinji Ikari. and a promise of more to come should make your trip worthwhile",

            "content": "[This review does contain spoilers due to being a rant of sorts, you've been warned!]\r\n|||||||\r\n||||||\r\n[Also, let it be known that I watched this dubbed]\r\n|||||\r\n||||\r\n|||\r\n||\r\n|\r\nAlright, I cannot remember when exactly I'd started watching this anime, but it wasn't very long ago. I started watching it right after finished Gargantia (which is a great anime by the way and I highly recommend checking it out!). I've gotten into a sort of wanting to watch mech anime recently and after watching Gargantia, I was looking for something similar. And thus, I found Aldnoah.Zero. \r\nNow, I watched this on Netflix and right off the bat loved the cast. Fromthe guy who voices King in Seven Deadly Sins and Arima in Your Lie In April to other Your Lie in April voice actors, the cast is very well done, including the guy who does Masaomi in Durarara!!. I give the show a point for that, considering before Gargantia I was watching YLiA. \\n\\n\r\nNow, onto Aldnoah itself. The premise is alright, in a way. It's kind of boring and the fact that the people never get any better tech kinda sucks. You're fighting against people from space so what do you do? Use the same old mechs that all look the same and are easy to blow up. Yeah, that sounds safe. \\n\r\nThe whole war is at first thought to be caused by the assassination of the princess of VERS, Asalem. I really wish there would have been more backstory for her. There was some, but not nearly enough to make her likeable, same with the other character, the main especially. He had no development whatsoever nor emotions. It was kind of difficult to care about a character that you can't tell how they're feeling and they just look like a wannabe soldier. \\n\\n\r\nOther than that, another issue of mine with the show was in a way, the soundtrack. Yes, music is nice and adds drama. But if you have to add music to fight scenes just to make them 'more dramatic' then you're failing. Not to mention the music didn't really change much, it all stayed very much consistent. Some variation would have been nice, at least. \\n\\n\r\nIn all, Aldnoah.Zero was an okay anime and average if anything. It failed at a lot of things and I'm not even going to bother with the second season because I don't feel it's worth the time or effort. For a 12 episode season that seemed easy, it sure felt like it took forever to trudge through. \\n\\n\r\nThat's all for now, thanks for reading!\\n\\n\r\nUntil next time.\\n\\n\r\n ~ Chariminquaza",

            "content": "OVERALL:The show overall was decent. The story and how characters reacted to the situations that were presented made sense for the most part. I wasn't left thinking, \"well that just made no sense whatsoever\" as tends to happen in most anime. It was pretty strong. No obviously major holes. Pretty much all the questions that needed to be answered in a first season were answered and just enough was left unknown to make you want to watch the next season. Though it wasn't an anime that had me hooked from the get go, leaving me needing to watch the next episode, it did hook meinto the next season. \\n\\n\r\nSTORY:The show is fairly predictable, which doesn't make it bad, it just makes it safe. I don't think safe is a \"bad\" thing, it's just a bit boring. The thing that I felt saved the show from being totally boring was the last episode. It was the only point in the series where I felt really invested in the characters and felt the need to see what happened next. \\n\\n\r\nART:I liked the art style. It was a little bit different, creating a rounded and soft look about the characters, but with a subtle sharpness. It gave the male characters a very \"pretty\" kind of feel. The female characters were a little typical though. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND: The music is pretty good. It sounds a lot like the soundtrack for Kill la Kill though. The music for each show was done by the same person so it makes sense, but a unique soundtrack can really help make an anime and when an iconic sound from another show is playing it can be a little distracting. Naruto is a good example of iconic sound. The music from Naruto is uniquely Naruto and, for many fans, hearing those sounds can really amp up the mood for a fight or set the viewer up for a tearjerker. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:The characters are really not great. They're very average. The supporting characters are very typical and very few of the characters are actually developed. My two main issues were the main character, Inaho, and the princess. Inaho is what I would call an extreme case of the \"composed type.\" Most of the time he seems like an emotionless lump. I think there were only a couple moments where he seemed to have emotions, and some of those moments weren't even directly from him but from the words of other characters. Yet somehow it was just enough to cause me to become somewhat attached to him, attached enough to care whether he lives or dies. Even though I wish there was a little more emotion from him, they did succeed in giving him an underlying sense of emotion. They managed to paint the picture of an incredibly emotionally challenged genius. \\n\r\nThe princess was my possibly my least favorite character. This is mostly because she filled the part of the delicately adorable love interest. I hate these characters. They're like the magikarp of anime. If you pick an anime randomly and then go watch it nine out of ten times the main love interest is going to be meek and cute little girl with a sweet little high pitched voice to go with her incredibly strong moral compass. Princess Asseylum is that character and fits the role perfectly. I'm a little tired of these characters and it almost annoys when I end up liking the character, though that usually has to do with the character of the male love interest and how they interact with each other. Though a review is based mostly on opinion this particular part is purely my own opinion and I apologize for the rant. Looking at it technically there's nothing wrong with the princess' character. She's just so... *sigh* typical... On a side note I think her dress is a bit ridiculous and would probably work better on a magical girl, but that could just be me.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:I think the best way of putting this is that I didn't not enjoy the show. Yeah. I did;t not enjoy it. I think it's a good show to put on if you want something playing in the background while you wash the dishes or something. Something that you don't have to fully pay attention to.",

I love all the genre to some extent and it was mecha that really  first introduced me to this genre because of the drama,action and etc that you can get from watching these type of shows.\r\n  The plot gets shown right from the start, which is great sincetheres been a few shows now that ive watch that take their time with the plot or have a difficulty introducing it to the viewers.  The characters were great, art was alright, sound nothing really to complain about, and over all a nice one to watch.\\n\\n\r\n  For those still debating whether to give this one a go or not, id advice to give the 3 episode rule  a try before dropping it.

Why did I liked it, why do I tell you, that haven't seen this yet, to see it? \r\nBecause its worth it. \r\nThe story is reaaaly enjoyable, its one of those anime that is rare to find, because even the main character is likeable (not to many these days imo). \r\nAnd its not your usual fairytale series. \r\nThe story is all in the summary about the series, just read it there. But I willgo over point after point about the whole anime. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10 \\n\r\nThe story is really interesting, not new, but enjoyable and tells a good story. \\n\r\nA story about peace between worlds, but a war breaks, what will the two faction do. Sort of. The pacing seems ok, but at some part, yes, it does get a little slow.\\n\r\nAnd when I heard the series got a 2nd, I was thinking \"How will the story still be interesting up until the final\", but they did a good job making it interesting tbh. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10 \\n\r\nThe Art was really good, it isnt \"Ufotable\" animation, but I dont think their animation would do this anime justice because \"Ufotables\" animation is really good, but suits fantasy storytelling better then Mecha, action genres.\\n\r\nThe running, walking and other emotions the characters was showing (etc. holding, running, walking, combat etc. etc) was really fluently.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nThe first season really did overuse some soundtrack, I feelt that alot of songs were overplayed a couple of times, especially the ending song was played inbetween interesting parts and whatnot. They weren't bad songs, on the contrary, they were awesome songs, but overused and overplayed unfortunately.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this series served their purpose, either they were really good, or really annoying, don't think I actaully hated or thought a character didn't belong to the series at all, all characters found their place and executed their role perfectly. There were SOME characters that were annoying OR shallow, but they served their purpose either way.\\n\r\nOfcourse I have some favorite characters of the series, like Inaho, Slaine, Rayett and ever his older sister Yuki Kaizuka was likeable. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10 \\n\\n\r\nThis is a section I am like \"whot?\" and has to really think what I want to be put here. Did I enjoy it? Yes. Why? I like Mecha. I do concider this a mecha series. Not all agree, but it is actually. And one of my favorite as well. The reason why I rate this series as high as I can, is because this series doenst use Lolis or typical character characteristics etc. It is a fairly good series, that is serious, that doesn't involve lolis, extreme facial expression etc. It wants to be takes seriously and it is takes seriously. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10 \\n\\n\r\nThe series is really good, and is to be watched by seinen, mecha or action fanatics because it is really good, and it is worth it. It has its moment where u are stumble, and with your jaw on the ground thinking, \"what was that?\" \"really?\". I recommend it to any mecha, seinen or action lover out there!",

            "content": "What happens when you combine Gen Urobuchi, Sawano Hiroyuki, and Yuki Kajiura in one anime? Well, it will become one hell of ride experience when you try to enjoying the anime in each episode and you will expecting some major plot twist since Gen Urobuchi for his famous plot twister since Fate series, Psycho Pass and etc. Aldnoah Zero also wasn\u2019t an exception when he making this series but, I can tell you, the series wasn\u2019t bad and it has some good points which you might like it.\r\nAldnoah Zero has some average story but it\u2019s not your average mecha and action genre. You will findthe series has insert some logical part yet not too reasonable as you enjoying the action pack fighting mecha using science logic. It\u2019s not too complicate like you need to have wiki on your side to watch but, I find it more interesting since I love science especially when MC explain the theory of each attack made by enemy and it makes the battle looks real in terms of logic. Aldnoah Zero also do a decent job telling us story between each side since it\u2019s a tragic war between them and made the story unique and having the impact between middle and the end of story.\\n\\n\r\nWhat make Aldonah Zero different with any mecha genre that I have seen, is the interaction in each character especially our two main male characters. We can see different aspect and view within these two as they progress with their own story and for the same time developing new characteristic. One is being lack of emotion but very smart with logical thinking to survive in war and one is being too idealistic and very loyal until he can reach his goal. These are two sides in one coin which we as audience need not to make haste judgment in each side which is one of the interesting parts in this series. Other characters also do have some spotlight in each episode which you can see their own perspective being conveyed.\\n\\n\r\nI have nothing to say specifically for animation. In general, studio A-1 Pictures did a good job handling battle animation especially in CGI. You can see each mecha suit has their own unique ability followed by their design which pretty decent for mecha genre. What I like about animation is the gorgeous surrounding or environment of each episode. For example, the buildings, the sky, sea and etc looks beautiful if you watching it thoroughly.\\n\\n\r\nWhen watching Aldnoah Zero, one will experience the thrilling of action especially in mecha battle and enjoying one of the awesome soundtracks composed by none other than famous Yuki Kajiura for her other masterpiece like Tsubasa Chronicles, and Fate series. Did I also mention Sawano Hiroyuki earlier? Yes my friend, since he was famous with his other project like guilty crown and attack on titan, you will be listening some blowing soundtrack while watching the series. Kalafina also famous for their opening in fate zero joins in to make this series overwhelming with opening song of series and Sawano Hiroyuki for ending song. In my opinion, this is not your everyday ost when two famous composer doing collaboration which is rare and you\u2019ll probably not tired listening it again.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict:\\n\r\nAldnoah Zero is an anime which its uniqueness is another level compares to other sci-fi anime that I have seen. The action and the character development make your seat uncomfortable in each episode which makes you exciting. The combination of story, ost and the animation makes Aldnoah Zero worth to watch it.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Let me start by saying that I don't enjoy anime like this so to speak. With that being said however I won't hate on Aldnoah.Zero too badly. \r\nI have to imagine the budget for this anime must have been good as the animation never misses a beat and this plays very well with the series well choreographed mech-action scenes. The soundtrack is excellent as well and is also used to bolster the impact of the action scenes. If you came to Aldnoah to watch mechs fight you won't be disappointed. The first season ending is gutsy, to say the least. This may pan out aseither a good or bad thing depending on the viewer but I really enjoy moves like this and it is certainly not something I saw coming.\\n\\n\r\nPointing out the \"elephant in the room\" within this 12 episode first season is how underwhelming the emotionless-husk of a main character Inaho is. I do mean that he is very, very bad. In fact, aside from Rayet and Marito, none of the characters really stood out to me and many of them came off as underdeveloped. The story, with the exception of the ending, was fairly predictable and isn't anything you haven't seen before but provides you with enough of an even pacing to keep you watching.",

            "content": "*!Possible Spoilers Ahead!*\r\nSo as someone who as a child despised mecha animes and to this day 10 years later i still do not like mecha anime, this anime was very good, the story was good, the characters were good, music and sound were amazing.\r\nStory : So i gave the story a 7/10 because while some things were not so good most of it was. We were given more than a few scenes set 15 years past the current time, where we were given why this second war is happening, why the first one happened, who these martians really are, and what's going on. Nothing reallyhappened before the humans found aldnoah on mars so we don't need any more information after that, we can conclude right off the bat that some of the mars counts and soldiers are good and bad, as with count cruhteo we knew right away he was truly for the princess's wishes because he had shown slaine some mercy, there weren't many plot holes in this anime a lot of it was explained or a given, something that a lot of people have a problem with is the ending and the characters which i will go into in a minute. In the last episode we are left off wondering what actually just happened, most of this is explained in the second season of the anime but, me personally i knew that if they had a second season they either had to keep at least the princess alive somehow or bring both of them back because, slaine's whole reason for fighting was for the princess so why would it continue if she was truly dead and how can earth fight back with the now shut down aldnoah drive of the deucalion, But like i said most of that is explained in the second season. \\n\\n\r\nArt: The art style of this anime was one of the most enjoyable things about this anime. A lot of things flowed and worked really well, while there were some clunky parts and some thing that seemed off most of it fit very well together, the colors and light and shading and everything just blended in very well one thing that did seemed weird was the animation for some guns i felt it a bit weird but not to where it changed the anime drastically. I give the art style an 8 just for the way hair or other things flowed and how everything seemed to fit pretty well.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound was absolutely amazing I love the whole soundtrack from this anime from opening to ending and everything in between, Music was great, The voice actors sounded Great according to their characters and there really wasn't any fault on the voice actors or anything that seemed out of place, again i felt the guns lacked a bit but not enough to change my overall feel for the anime. It's obviously a 10 i really didn't have any problems with sound or feeling like something didn't fit.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: So i'm not putting a 10 for characters because there isn't much that characters can really build on or from like when i said in my story segment, the only history that needs to be known is when the humans went to mars and found aldnoah which then a war followed soon after that Lt. Marito was apart of his character in general is very good because it shows a actual feel that this guy isn't just some no body and he has a past that haunts him and is stopping him from fighting. When we found out that Magbaredge was the brother of Marito's friend who Marito had to kill that added a lot of character development to it tying these to characters pasts together. As for inaho and the other High schoolers you can't really go back on their past as they were in a time of peace at that current state, nothing important in these characters lives had happened until now. Like wise there were no characters that had no point in the anime all the people who died were like extras in a movie or tv show, no character had a backstory or was explained only to die in the next episode which i found amazing, All of the characters have some role even if Inaho is the only reason earth can win, we don't need 5 people like inaho because then the martians wouldn't have any chance and the anime wouldn't be good in that since there really wouldn't be a fight for survival and even inaho has his limits like when in the last episode where he had to fight off both Count saazbaum and slaine, which he pretty much failed to do, so this shows that inaho has a limit to his capabilities.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I honestly try to finish an anime even if i don't like it but there are some i just can't. However for aldnoah zero i finished it and enojyed it thoroughly. This anime overall is great and especially if mechas or mecha anime is what you like, everyone sees things differently and has different opinions about anything and anime is no different. Like i said  i hated mecha anime i never had ever liked them this is the first mecha anime for me to really enjoy watching so Overall it gets an 8 from me it's not perfect but nothing is ever perfect.",

            "content": "There were times where I don\u2019t really care about analytical way of seeing anime, and just watch them mindlessly. Yes, it is when I just came to this hobby. At that times, every single anime is actually stood out to me and I could pretty much talk about how good they are.\r\n\tNow its been roughly 6 years since I started, yes I am still new but there is one thing that have been bothering me since years ago, and that was Aldnoah.Zero. Honestly speaking, like any other anime on my early days, Aldnoah.Zero got a pretty high rank from me, but not to everybody else.Why? That is the question that I wanted to asked and I am here after I watch it few more time and oh boi I was wrong. So, without further ado, LETSGO!\\n\r\nStory + Character\\n\r\n\tIn the beginning of the series, humanity has divided into 2, the Terrans, humans that lived on earth, and Martians, humans that lived on Mars. This words is literally everywhere on the series like its forgetting the word \u201chuman\u201d and just go racist. Anyway, Martians lived on Mars due to the discovery of Aldnoah which literally fuel up everything. This makes them dissociate themselves from the Terrans. Even though that Aldnoah fuels up everything, resource in Mars is limited, so they invaded earth in search for resource (why the hell they didn\u2019t think about that in the first place? HMM). Coming long way from Mars, they bring their mechs or Kathaprakt, and their flying castle with them.\\n\r\n\tOn earth, humanity- I mean Terrans has developed their own kathaprakt after seeing them in the first war (which failed due to certain reason) but it lack of power due to fact that they don\u2019t have aldnoah.\\n\r\n\tThe premise is actually really good and the first episode will likely leave a strong impression on your mind. But things went downhill from that point. I\u2019ll get to the character first before going back to this.\\n\r\n\tThe characters are pretty much predictable, our main protagonist (which still in highscool), and his friends, the Princess of Vers (yes, im aware of spoiler so chill guys), and our main antagonist, any other character is poorly made (except Lt. Marito which is really good in season 1) to the fact that we dont and the story don\u2019t care about them anymore in the second cour. To make it simple ill introduce the mains as these: Bland-oversmart main character, too-plain Princess, and what-is-in-his-mind antagonist. I know justifying their character as that is horribly but like I said, to make it simple (and it hurts your hearts if you overthink about them).\\n\r\n\tNow back again to the main problems, the story has this particular way of telling which part is the main focus of now, not by following the \u201cplot\u201d, not by resolving around the main character, but the story resolve around the Princess. Some may think that the story changes a lot from season 1 to season 2 (which it is), but it\u2019s not random, it\u2019s just because of this not-so-popular formula.\\n\r\n\tThat and the fact that none of the main leads have a believable reason to develop their character is already enough to turn down this series. And I guess that is what happened.\\n\r\nAnimation + Music\\n\r\n\tAldnoah.Zero was a collaboration project of A-1 Pictures and TROYCA. The collab is actually good due the fact that TROYCA can cover what A-1 Pictures lack of: maintaining quality. That is why we got some solid animation throughout the season, heck even throuthout the series.\\n\r\n\tThe down side of the production is actually the use of BAD CG (INPUT GIGGUK sound) yes Gigguk, Bad CG. The use of CG is pretty much the same as Initial D. For tou who doenst know about Initial D, I mean that it is pretty bad. I guess it\u2019s the only thing that is good from second season, the fact that we don\u2019t really see the mech (In the space) so we didn\u2019t really bothered with it.\t\\n\r\n\tAldnoah.Zero has 2 famous composers on its back. Kajiura Yuki and Sawano Hiroyuki. Which is I don\u2019t know why but has much downside that the good side. The thing is that we cant have 2 primary color in a single anime. That\u2019s why the first season\u2019s OP and ED feels don\u2019t match. I appreciate the decision of letting Kajiura Yuki go and went full Sawano for the second season, even though that it\u2019s decent, but it has it\u2019s own colour.\\n\r\nWrap Up\\n\r\n\tSo in the end, it turns out that there is so many downside of the series. But even so, I still enjoy the times rewatching it for this review. I don\u2019t actually sure why, but I guess I just weak for main protagonist that smartly use his brain to win a fight. The first season, is actually quite enjoyable overall with pretty good climax. But things gotten worst in the second season thus the first season\u2019s climax feels not believable, which led to my biggest disappointment of all. Oh and by the way, Aliez is the only track that I listen to recently, and is the strongest that reminds me of this series.\\n\r\n\tSo I bring you Aldnoah.Zero with the final rank of B that it\u2019s up to you to watch it or not, but it has the \u201cgive it a try of your own\u201d from me. As for three of recommendations I give you, Tengen Toppa Guren Lagann, the obvious ones but I need to recommend it because Guren Lagann is the one that teaches me what is Mech anime and what it is to be a man, then I suggest you Darling in the FRANXX for some real character development, it is not finished yet but I have a strong faith in it, and lastly Heavy Object, it is written by my favorte light novel writer and the main protagonist also use his brain to save the day.",

            "content": "Total junk. This is the anime equivalent of a Roland Emmerich film. Cheap shallow drama conducted by utterly substanceless, one dimensional characters, wrapped up in a big budget high concept story so as to pull the wool over your eyes. Not a single character has an arc; none of them have any motives beyond nothing relationships that you're expected to just go with; none of the events contain a modicum of tension. The only way to enjoy this is to entirely ignore the events on screen and treat it like a music video or something.\r\nThe protagonist has no motive or personality. He's a quiet, hyperintelligent nerd who just knows how to beat everyone and all the girls love him. He's kind of like the protagonist of a lot of young adult fiction, a self insert wish fulfillment guy for little boys. The other male lead does nothing but look kind of sad and get his ass whooped - he likes the princess. That's it. That's all there is to him. The princess herself is one of the most insufferably trite characters I've seen in anime. She's a pure peacemaker with not an ounce of malice in her body. Someone tries to kill her and she weepily apologises to her attempted murderer.  Oh my gosh isn't she so sweet? Stop putting these characters in military science fiction for god's sake.. Basically every female character in this show with the exception of the ship captain feels like a disgusting fabrication to sell toys and be eye candy. None of them do anything. They're just there to go oh my god! when Inaho perfectly destroys an opponent without batting an eye.\\n\\n\r\nThere's no attempt at developing a world. Mars has insane, super advanced technology while earth just looks like contemporary earth. But then 10 episodes in one of the Martians says actually despite the technology Mars is really impoverished and spartan in its society. What? This is a guy in a gigantic space palace dressed up like a 19th century Baron. All the Martian characters are like feudal lords. But Mars is poor? WHAT?  Early on you think \"oh interesting, the earth people have inferior technology - but look at the way the Martians act, they're all headstrong rivals. So surely they will invade and find themselves beaten due to the superior training and discipline of the earth soldiers, perhaps lead by our charismatic main character.\"\\n\\n\r\nNah. They just slap everyone around like ragdolls. Until Inaho shows up and he like does some stupid physics trick that entirely removes tension and neuters the drama. Over and over. The characters constantly go \"grrr this is a war! this is a battlefield!\" but is it? Because you just see the one ship sort of meander while Big Bads fly in and get owned by a 14 year old redditor. Are there battles? Who's winning? Surely it should be over since Inaho is the only one with an IQ high enough to even contest the Martians? But if it's not does that mean the earth army is actually winning? Then why do I care about this one specific ship? Oh because it has the horrible waifu bait princess character  onboard, right!\\n\\n\r\nThey repeatedly make these embarrassing PTSD asides as if to try and trick you into thinking this is an intelligent or mature show. It's not. It's trash. Avoid, or if you can't, watch on 3x speed and spare yourself.",

            "content": "THE REVIEW IS MOSTLY ABOUT INAHO AND HIS FEELINGS.\r\nYou can define good title by the longlasting effect it causes in your head, by the thoughts it brings and (in this case) the soundtrack which is on repeat for weeks, the overall enjoyment.\r\nSo the score is mostly based on the emotional impact which is strong during the eleven episodes and extremely strong in the last episode. This depends on the viewer himself and that's where the show caught me: i'm weak on such things (not (only) dicks), especially sudden plot twists.\r\nSomething i cannot agree with: DEVELOPMENT OF INAHO'S CHARACTER and Inaho's emotionlessness, from the very beginninghe is not as emotionless as it seems, Yuki explains it right later despite it is rare and the only emotions we can clearly see on his face are during the most critical events of battle. The last episode suddenly shows us absolutely opposite side of his character when he lost smth he felt for the first time in his life, the moment works perfect. The development of his character is clearly seen when this feeling of sympathy/love appears, but Inaho obviously can't understand and accept it, covering it with cold words about war. There is moment when it seems Seylum understands Inaho, giving him smile as an answer which looks like \"yes, i understand it, Inaho, you're this special kind of person and it is not the place for this feeling, you don't even understand what you feel now\". Seylum's \"I'm here\" and Inaho's sudden denial of regular situation analysis and cold tactics and actions (remember his smile) in the end of 12th episode can be considered as love confession between them and Inaho's acceptance of his feelings to her.\\n\\n\r\nThis leads us to another important thing - the conflict between Inaho and Slaine, which is based on love to Seylum. The difference is in the way of expression. This conflict will fully come out in the second season. Even both of them have their own reasons to fight on their sides the main reason of their own personal war is Seylum. The foundation for the conflict starts (for us) with the case of Rayleigh scatter, by the way. The main proof is that Seylum becomes the main motivational instrument for Inaho later on, in second season.\\n\\n\r\nDespite many argumentative dislikes and bad reviews, first season of Aldnoah made great impression on me, and i just can't ignore it.",

            "content": "The mecha genre is one of my favourites for the simple reason that giant robots are awesome, but they also have some really good stories and characters along with the cool robots. The Gundam franchise, Code Geass, Evangelion and Full Metal Panic come to mind when i say this. Then we enter the subject for this review Aldnoah.Zero a show which could've been amazing with a story concept penned by Gen Urobuchi of Fate/Zero fame and even directed by the same guy who did the Fate/Zero anime Ei Aoki, yet it falls flat in many categories and while not being the worst thing either itwas certainly a let down for myself being incredibly generic, unmemorable and followed up by one of the most appalling second seasons I've ever seen. But that's a review for another time, for now lets dive in to the first season.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5/10. The story for Aldnoah.Zero actually has a very interesting set up. During a mission to the moon Astronauts discover a hyper gate which takes them to Mars, there they discover an ancient technology which they dub Aldnoah, From there they succeed from Earth establishing the Vers Empire and eventually declaring war on the Terrans that remained on Earth, during the conflict the hyper gate goes haywire and explodes destroying part   of the moon in the process with the debris falling to Earth. The event is dubbed Heaven's Fall and an uneasy ceasefire is established between the factions Sounds pretty cool right? Unfortunately the show doesn't really do much with this set up. Despite a very good first episode which sets things up well the story then descends into mediocrity for the rest of the series, until the ending cause the ending to this season is straight up bad. Without spoilers they try to do something interesting but completely screw it up and only make things worse by how the follow up on it with the second season. But i'm getting ahead of myself, overall the story had some promise and does actually have one or two good moments, but ultimately falls flat on its face due to some bad writing and narrative decisions like in the second episode for instance where they make a decision which just leaves a massive plot hole in events of the prior episode which kinda ruins it honestly\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10. Overall the art in the show is... fine its fine. The characters are all well drawn and animated, the environments are nice and the animation is solid. The mechs in the series which are called katafrackts (I think thats how you spell it) are generally well designed but are rendered in CG which varies from being good making for some entertaining action scenes which are for the most part fun to watch, but at times the CG does go below par which is very noticeable.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10. Easily the part that gets the most praise in Aldnoah is its soundtrack which is great Sawano composes a very memorable score for the show which i find myself listening to time and time again. Easily the most memorable track is the Ending them ALieZ which is very good and probably one of the better Ending themes out there. Aside from that the sound design in the show is good nothing outstanding but it works for the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 3/10. The characters in Aldnoah are bad, like just straight up awful. The show has 3 leads Inaho Kirito er i mean Kaizuka our protagonist, Slaine Troyard, a Terran who is in service of Vers and Lacus Clyne, i mean Euphimia, i mean Asseylum, the princess of Vers. all 3 are terrible Inaho is incredibly boring and has absolutely no character traits at all, except he likes eggs i guess, and is REALLY good at piloting mechs. He's just an emotionless  blank slate with no reason as to why he shows no emotion, people have said it's cause he is a war orphan but the show never tells or shows us anything to suggest this, i'm not saying spoon feed us but just give us something like someone just lightly suggesting that's why he doesn't show emotion it might've provided a base for some good character development, instead i'm just gonna assume that the writers couldn't be bothered giving him a personality. Slaine had some basis to be an interesting character, his status as a Terran who is in service of Vers could have allowed for some interesting character moments and storytelling. The show somewhat explores this but it ultimately doesn't really do anything with it Slaine sort of gets shafted in terms of screen time and ends up just sort of being there, not really becoming relevant until the anime's climax which as i've previously stated is awful so overall he is basically useless. As for Asseylum well, if you've seen Lacus Clyne in Gundam Seed you've seen Asseylum she's the princess character who just wants peace and has a super naive outlook on the world and gosh darn it isn't she precious, except she's not she's goddamn annoying and straight up becomes a plot device which is basically her role in the whole freaking show. The rest of the characters aren't that memorable either, the token fan service girl, the best friend, the sister, the loner with a mysterious past. Only one character in the show is of any merit and that is Marito a soldier of the earth forces who fought in the previous war He has an interesting PTSD story line which actually provides for some good narrative moments. Had he been the shows main focus it would've made for a much more interesting story. But alas.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10 Despite the many flaws i did have some enjoyment with the show, the first 3 episodes are of decent quality, the actions good and the soundtrack is great However i cannot overlook the narrative flaws and straight up bad characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10 There is enjoyment to be had in Aldnoah S1 for sure but it makes so many mistakes that just can't be overlooked on the grand scheme of things However i do think it's worth at least one watch but if you want a good story of war between earth bound humans and Spacenoids, watch the original Mobile Suit Gundam.\\n\\n\r\n Now as for Aldnoahs second season well...",

            "content": "As a regular fan of mecha anime and an audiophile, I originally decided to watch this show as I had heard good things about the soundtrack.  Coming into the show I had reasonable expectations as I had hoped it would be the unique intersection of quality show and amazing soundtrack I had hoped for.  To these expectations I was met halfway and found myself in the middle of an average tier anime given a great soundtrack.\r\nTo break down this show into the review categories I'll be brief about each one\r\nStory 7:  I don't really feel good about giving it a 7 butthe beginning of the show was just so great I can't get that landing castle nuke scene out of my head.  The story itself was par for the course at best, a story of a fake assassination turned into \"just cause\" for a \"righteous\" war didn't really stand out to me especially given the execution of the plot.  Any plot twists or deviations I would/should/could have expected were downright pedestrian and it left me feeling that I was watching the show, just for the sake of watching it.\\n\\n\r\nArt:  I'm not really big on reviewing art in anime, as long as its not some overuse of horrible CGI and the animation is decent I'll give it a pass so 9 here means I liked to view the anime\\n\\n\r\nSound:  Ah yes the best part, 10/10.  Simply put in the absence of a future without more Nujabes music (RIP) I look to Hiroyuki Sawano for quality sound work on shows and man does he deliver here.  THat nuke scene in the beginning was absolutely insane, blew my mind away and the music couldn't have been better for the occasion.  If ever there was a reason I would wanna watch this  show again or recommend it to a friend it would stem largely from Sawano's heavylifting on the soundtrack.  I very highly recommend googling or searching for the Aldnoah soundtrack on youtube.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 5:  I'm gonna skip this part as there's just nothing distinguishing about the characters.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:  Ah yes the most subjective score, I gave it a 7 cause of the soundtrack, good visuals, and decent action/combat scenes.  This is likely where I'd recommend the show to others so in that sense I would say sure give it a go.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall 7:  yeah its not a stellar anime but its okay.  Would i recommend it to a friend?  If they liked mecha and wanted a good OST then sure otherwise probably not.",

            "content": "Quite a lot of the reviews here on this are unfairly harsh on Aldnoah Zero. Most of it seem to be because of overzealous \"loyalty\" to the \"originals\", ignorant of the fact that the theme of Homeworld vs. Colonies (usually Earth vs. Mars) is a very common trope in science fiction. From classics like Greg Bear's Moving Mars and Ursula K. LeGuin's The Dispossessed to newer stuff like James S.A. Corey's The Expanse series. Gundam did not invent it. Any review whose only point of comparison is Gundam betrays a very limited perspective of science fiction.\r\nWith that rant aside, Aldnoah Zero stands on its ownquite well with the genre. The plot is a familiar one, but still a good one. Touching on topics like war, xenophobia, revenge and forgiveness, social stratification etc. Lots of twists and turns in the political intrigue as well. \\n\\n\r\nIt's somewhat \"hard\" sci-fi, so while the technologies are more advanced they admirably remain within the realm of scientific believability (with the exception of the alien Aldnoah tech, of course). Things like G-LOC  to even the accuracy of a world map post-sea level rise. \\n\\n\r\nThe overarching theme is that of underdogs fighting an overwhelmingly more powerful force. Big emphasis on overwhelming. They are rats fighting lions. But that fact in itself contributes to why the fight scenes in this series is truly enjoyable. Because science is used in the tactics itself, turning the tide on seemingly hopeless scenarios in a way that leaves you cheering.\\n\\n\r\nGraphics is beautiful, with both hand-drawn and CGI art. Unlike some of the newer anime fans here, I am not a CGI snob. I grew up on pre-CGI anime so I fully appreciate how CGI make some scenes in modern anime far better than they could ever be if they were purely hand-drawn. However, I am of the GITS school when it comes to mechas. I have a dislike for designs which are deliberately form over function. Too many of the mechas (at least the Martian ones) are designed like this, taking design cues from insects, mythological figures, etc. More like toys than actual war machines. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter-wise, it's split between very good to very bad. Most of the characters are complex with their own motivations. Even the main antagonists aren't just mindlessly evil. They have their own rational reasons for doing the things they do. However, the way they depict a lot of the minor antagonists isn't as good. They invariably depict them as maniacal, one-dimensional monsters who seemingly have zero empathy. And lastly is one thing I despise immensely - fan service. There are bits of it throughout the series. Not a lot thankfully, but when they do occur, they are blatant and distracting.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's a very good space opera. Not exactly breaking new ground, but still very good. Leave all comparisons with Gundam at the door and you'll enjoy it.",

It was a breath of fresh  air. Finally something that is not a harem. and does not have a lot of the cliche stuff plaguing recent anime. (check out 'heavy object ' to see what i mean)\\n\r\nThe plus point for the story is how it presents the narrative via many perspective. There is the MC, Slaine, princess mars, Main bad guy, the assassin girl, war veteran. Most are compelling except for the mc. His job is to kick the enemies' ass . \\n\r\nwe see why the mars bad guy wants to start a war, we see Slaine struggling to save the princess, we see the princess getting to terms that a war started because of her, we see the veteran struggling with post traumatic  event syndrome. We see the MC defeat the enemy via plot armour. we see the assassin girl struggle with the reality that her father also assassin is killed to silence his mouth.  Seldom a dull moment. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Disclaimer: This review contains minor spoilers in the character section, nothing plot-ruining or upsetting, it gets revealed in the first episodes.\r\nI've noticed that this anime has a lot of mediocre reviews (not a comment on the reviews themselves, a comment on the ratings given) and I would like to throw my hat in the ring. Aldnoah.Zero S1 is one of the few animes I have actually rewatched, I enjoyed it, although I couldn't help but draw a lot of parallels to Code Geass, my favourite anime, which may have changed my grading for it.\r\nStory: All-in-all I don't think that it was a bad story, fairlystandard for what I've seen of mechas, not a genre I particularly enjoy. I did notice a few similarities between the story of this anime and that of CG, but I won't discuss them here. I did enjoy both though, keeping that in mind, I believe that this was a good story with a few twists and turns, but it also contained a few plot holes here and there. 7/10, maybe 7.5/10.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I didn't see too much stunning art, and with the animation used for some of the mecha fights, I see why the main character has no facial expressions due to the budget, but I did really like the smoothness of some of the fights, as well as the pretty stunning Earth imagery. 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I think that this anime had a fairly decent soundtrack, but nothing to write home about. I did really like the OP and EDs though. 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Let's isolate Inigo and Slaine in these. Inigo, was not the best character, in my opinion. He had a bit of a, emotionless mastermind feel to him at times, with his extraordinary strategic abilities given his age, but I feel like it could've been done better (as it was in other animes with similar protagonists), I myself cannot offer any real suggestions on how it could have been though. Maybe some more character development as to why he is expressionless and monotone, instead of \"just 'cause\". Slaine, was amazing, easily my favourite character, he had his motives clearly set out, he had an interesting backstory developed and explaining his situation and I think he was really well done. Some people complain about the simplicity of his motives or his occasional lackluster, but not all young adults have extremely convoluted and in-depth reasons, maybe just helping to save someone that saved you and made your life bareable? All of the other characters, I felt were a bit lackluster, and could have been done better (except Marito). Weighing all of these factors, I'm giving it a 7/10 on characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: The fact that I was excited when a season 2 was announced and I rewatched this series (as well as tried to make an abridged) speaks volumes over how much I enjoyed this show. I'm going to give it an 8/10, if I take into account it's absolute worst moments, but it was overall pretty enjoyable for someone who deosn't really like mechas.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: This was a good anime for me. I liked one of the MCs, but I also drew a lot of parallels to others I had seen. I liked the OP and EDs, as well as a few tracks from the OST, but apart from that, not much of the soundtrack. The animation was pretty smooth overall and some of the Earth visuals were aesthetically pleasing, as well as how cool some of the fights were. Overall I'm giving this a 7.5/10, or with rounding an 8/10. I would recommend it, but to those willing to go in without analysing too much.",

            "content": "Aldnoah.Zero more like Aldnoah.Zero/10 haaaaaaa-ah well it's not quite that bad but I'll try to adequately explain why. \r\nStory:\r\nAZ is for the most part a pretty blank example of what skeleton of mecha story looks like with no meat on it aside from fleshy genitalia dangling back and forth that has [s]NO LOVE DEEP WEB[/s] Urobutcher written on it. \r\nIt has it all. Pointless and undeveloped romance, politics with no reason to care about them, child pilots that are for some reason better than any adult soldier on Earth and unsubstantiated rivalry. Throughout all this there's glimpses of something good but don't leg me deceiveyou, it's straight up bad and whenever there's potential for something more it's quickly vanquished. It's obvious that Urobunchi had stuff planned out throughout first season but then left and they let monkeys with typewriters improvise what happens between those planned plot points. What they came up is pretty funny to watch at times like when they have a little girl drive a huge truck through enemy fire and explosions or when an exciting, plot important alliance is formed but then import part of that alliance is blown sky high minutes later or when main character shoots down the plane of a character who saved his life cause he might be an enemy spy but then gives back a gun to an actual spy who got onto the ship to assassinate the VIP and almost did just that twice. Oh and it's pretty funny when get the balls to kill off two main characters except there's hardly a reason to care about them and I'm pretty sure they'll somehow be alive in S2.\\n\r\nThe only legit good part of the writing for me were the fights that featured striking down superior opponents by strategizing and figuring out their weak spots. It still has some convenience and the show was too scared to kill or injure named characters which removed quite a bit of tension but it was still fun to watch. \\n\\n\r\nArt and animation: Mediocre. The backgrounds are unremarkable digital paintings with a lot of shortcuts done through 3D software and cheap texturing, in some points you can even easily see that they added elements of backgrounds solely through textures so when looked at angle it looks completely flat. Character designs are also pretty unremarkable but at least there's no same face and you can easily tell anyone apart. Robots are neat, martians had an array of slick and original designs and even though they look very busy at times it's still good. Earth on the other hand had a walking box that looks lamer than GMs. \\n\r\nAnimation rarely goes beyond average aside from few fights but generally it's solid and consistent even if not in any way outstanding. \\n\\n\r\nMusic: it's Sawano which at his most \"euhkay\". It doesn't stand out from his other compositions and even the trademark Kobayashi track is somewhat forgettable but it gets the job done to set mood for important scenes. \\n\\n\r\nFunfactor: it's kind of a funny trainwreck at times and fights are decent but otherwise a complete waste of time.",

            "content": "This show was absolutely fantastic! The story was deep and pretty interesting, telling the tale of how human have once left to live on Mars and now they want to go back to Earth and take over with their advanced technology. The story starts with a Princess who travels to Earth to make peace and tries to rejoin the two nations as one, but fails when a group of people try to sabotage her being on Earth. She then groups up with our main characters, one of which is incredibly dull and acts like a robot for most of the show. The other characters however all have their own personality, but the main focus of the show wasn't the characters them selves, so over the episodes you will see more action and story telling than you will see character development. Although only a few characters go through a character arch, the few that do make the story change drastically and it was pulled off extremely well. Also I want to add the music just made every scene. They used the same songs throughout the show (like most anime) but the songs they used were beautifully made and well used. The show kept me interested all through, and I enjoyed the story as well. Make you when you watch it to pay attention to what is happening as well as what the characters are going through and what may change.",

            "content": "Story: We've all seen mecha anime before, but I know a lot of people who enjoy this show, and with good reason. The story is pretty interesting. There are two nations existing in this world, those who live on Earth and those who live on Mars. For years, they have been at war with each other until the Princess of Mars, Asseylum, wants to travel to Earth to make peace between the two planets. However, a terrorist attack has been put in place to make sure the two planets stay in war forever. A group of high school students, led by Inaho Kaizuka, are pulledinto the army in order to finally bring peace to both nations. You'd think this would be a generic story, but actually, it's a lot more complex. Perhaps maybe a tad bit too complex. A lot of side story goes into this, but I do admit that it's a lot easier watching the dub version than the sub. That way, the plot is better told. Almost a full score, but I'd rate it 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The anime is really pretty to look at, and the action scenes are pretty cool to watch. I feel as if that every shonen show that I watch has a certain style, and this show does have a style all it's own. Sometimes, I feel as if more could be done with it though. I wish it could be larger than life at times, but only the first few episodes give me that feel. Otherwise, it's kinda nothing special, but at the same time it is. It's confusing; I know. With that said, I'm gonna rate this an 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I'm in love with the opening to this anime. The soundtrack in general is very good, but this anime made me become a Kalafina fan. It's very catchy, and the ending songs are also great (very famous at that). Out of the two endings, the first one, A/Z is my favorite. I don't know what it is about it, but I love the singer the most. However, Heavenly Blue is considered to be one of my favorite anime openings ever. Again, the music inside the anime is beautiful as well. Everything fits the setting, and nothing seems out of place. With that in mind, I rate this a perfect 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Each character is pretty much either a very great hit or a very bad miss. I actually split the characters down by race strangely enough. The Martian characters seem to be a lot more interesting than the Earth characters. Look, I'm probably in the same boat as all of you. Inaho is straight up boring. He has every single Mary Sue trope in his body, and I can't feel anything for this kid. His sister is a lot more interesting than he is. However, the only Earth character who sparks my interest the most is... (Sigh) Slaine. He's an adorable person (What I mean by adorable, I mean I want a body pillow of this guy so bad!). I mean, the ending makes me go \"What the fuck?\" but you feel more for this kid after the shit he's been through. Plus, his friendship with Asseylum is like something from a Disney movie. It's perfect. Speaking of Asseylum, she's no sitting duck when it comes to this anime. She is the only person in the anime who is truly the hero with all the work she does with the people of Earth. She makes the plans. She does everything in her power to keep Martians and Terrians at peace though her kingdom might as well want to destroy her. She's one of my favorite female characters ever. With that said, I would rate this portion an 8 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I guess I'm pretty biased, but I really liked this anime, and I can't wait to get started on the second season. What really stood out for me? Well, music, kinda the anime style, Slaine Troyard, Princess Asseylum, and the fighting scenes. This anime was almost perfect, but it was very good. Personally, I loved every minute of it. That's why I rate this 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: If I did the math right, this show was a straight up 9/10. I highly recommend you watching this show for all you science fiction lovers out there. I mean when you get past all of the boring characters, down underneath, there is some gold in this show. Excuse me while I go fangirl about the second season when I finally see the dub of it. Oh, and I do recommend the dub as well. It's done pretty great, and again, it's easier to understand the plot that way.",

            "content": "**THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN A FEW SPOILERS**\r\nAt first glance Aldnoah.Zero may look like a decent action, mecha, sci-fi anime and with the help of the first episode it makes it seem that way but after seeing all of it I can guarantee you that Aldnoah.Zero is not at all as it seems.\r\nStory: (4/10)\r\nThe story of Aldnoah.Zero begins in 1972 on the Apollo 17 mission where astronauts found a hypergate to Mars on the surface of the moon which then causes the astronauts a status of superiority. Soon after, many people move to mars and those people who moved there are now called martians. Princess Asseylumwho is the princess of mars comes to earth in attempt to make peace between each other but then war starts between earth and mars, then causes the people of mars wanting to kill everyone on earth. One of the problems I found in the story is how it uses terrible plot twists that don't make any sense and are just done to further the story. Another problem I found is how the story always makes the humans win each battle even though throughout the anime it shows that the martians are much more technologically superior than the humans are which ruins the potential of making the characters look like that they are all fighting for survival. My final problem with the story is how the ending does a lot of things that don't make any sense and it just leaves it ending very unsatisfactory.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation: (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this anime is very good. The backgrounds that are shown all look amazing, the character designs are fine, and I thought that the blue lighting that the anime occasionally uses around the mechs looks good. The main thing that is holding back the art is the CGI that it uses. The CGI is everywhere and it just makes the scenes much more unappealing. The animation is pretty fluent.\\n\\n\r\nSound: (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nI think that the soundtrack in Aldnoah.Zero is definitely the best part about it. The soundtrack helped make scenes much better, I think that the best track in it is \"aLIEz\" by SawanoHiroyuki[nZk]:mizuki. The OP and EDs are good. The voice actors are all fine and the sound effects are all average.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: (2/10)\\n\\n\r\nI think that the characters are the main problem in Aldnoah.Zero. All the characters are easily forgettable with them getting hardly getting development and some even getting no development. The characters that I said that get no development are the other pilots of the mechs because all they are there for is just to be killed and when they are killed none of the characters don't even care that they died. Kaizuka Inaho, our main character, is a terrible character. All he is there for is just to beat the bad guys because for some odd reason he is the best pilot of a mech even though we have never even seen him go through any training on how to pilot one and he has the personality of a rock. Troyard Slaine, our other main character, is just as bad as Inaho is. All he really does in the whole anime is get beat up or betrayed because he is supposed to be the character we are supposed to sympathize for and his personality is inconsistent which is shown even more near the end of the anime. The villains in this are nothing special, they are just your typical villains that are just evil to be evil.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (5/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe only things that I enjoyed in this anime were the giant mech fights, the visuals and the soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: (5/10)\\n\\n\r\nI think that Aldnoah.Zero has many good looking action scenes from time to time but even if it has that it is still an anime that is not worth watching due to all the problems that it displays throughout all the anime.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "NOTE: Im just going to give my personal objective biased opinion, doesn't mean im wrong, but it also doesn't mean that I know what the hell I'm talking about.\r\nSo what can be said about this series that hasn't been said already, well honestly not much. It is an older series so all the flaws are already out there but if you are like me then there are some reasons why you really enjoyed this show, so lets dive in. Now the art for aldanoah is decent everyone looks okay but the mechas are good not overwhelmingly clunky and much less cgi than you would expectfor a mech series. The music is standard but who watches a show for the music unless its an idol series.. But where people disagree with this show the most is the characters. This series is a shounen so expect the usual tropes. You have the good, the bad, and the in between. With our main lead character Inaho, he is the big argument for this series, does he truly ruin the show by being to stoic? Not developing? And just too OP? I say no, I grew up on shows like Naruto and Inuyasha where being a weak bitch who develops over 150 episodes are key. Those long development times make me fiend for OP characters from the start. Yes he is a shallow character who doesn't develop but you aren't going through the whole series where he relies on all his \"friendship power\" to beat an enemy. The supporting cast are bland no real use, the earth military sucks, \"hey hes just a kid he cant fight\" 3 minutes later, \"quick send Inaho were all dying hurr durr\". The politics in this series is way simpler than say Gundam which some will prefer that it is just action and mecha battles. Now I think that is my whole opinion so yes the characters probably are below average but the series is a fun watch with good action. Who will enjoy this show then and accept its flaws? Anybody who is a mech fan of say gundam or sidonia, or just like a good action with strong characters this will work for you.",

            "content": "*sigh*\r\n10 out of 10. That's the score I decided for this anime right after I finished the first episode, and that score remained unchanged until the last minute of the last episode!\r\nThe amazingness of this series suddenly became invalid because of that last minute. The fact that I LOVED this anime did not matter at that point, and I wanted to give it a score of 0. Yup 0 out of 10.\r\nI had to strongly remind myself of how I felt before that last minute and barely gave it a 6.\r\nLet's start from the beginning shall we\r\nThis anime basically show how humanity was divided totwo races, Terrans and Martians. Terrans are the citizens of Earth and Martians are the citizens of Mars, and a war happens between these two races, again.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was great, the fighting scenes were my favourite, intense and very enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nFor characters, each character had a fitting role, and I loved the different personalities, specially the main character Inaho, he was a very refreshing main character. The only problem I have about the characters is the 'motives' of some of the characters action, specially the antagonist, the \"revenge\" doesn't make any since at all, specially since it wasn't the Terrans fault, it feels like the writers just wanted to shove any excuse for his actions, it actually would've been better if it wasn't something like revenge but just plain selfishness and display of power.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow comes the moment that ruined this whole show\\n\\n\r\n[Spoiler Alert]\\n\\n\r\nSlaine, the dude who adores the princess, goes and defend the antagonist who admitted that he planned the assassination plan of the princess and still want to kill her, can you f*cking imagine that? owh and not only that, but he kills the guy who has been keeping the princess protected all this time ! *screams out of frustration* or at least shot him, we can't be sure he's\\n\\n\r\nNow the final act, to me, was an act of jealousy as slain realised that Inaho had feelings for the princess, still doesn't justify his actions at all, not even slightly.\\n\\n\r\n[END of spoiler]\\n\\n\r\nInaho is a great character, calm, collective, smart, knows what he does.\\n\r\nIt seems that this show was made just to prepare for the second season's new main character Slaine.\\n\r\nAs someone who loved how Inaho was and acknowledged him as a worthy protagonist, that doesn't make since.\\n\\n\r\nSlaine isn't even worth being a called a main character in this series, just a love sick puppy on the side, proved his worth once, but committed action that shatter all of the worth he had. Sorry not sorry.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not sure if I wan't to watch the 2nd season or not, it seems they will focus more on Slaine and I'm not really interested in his character anymore, the reviews are defiantly not encouraging too, i might give it a chance, but if i saw that the main focus is on Slaine I might drop it.",

            "content": "(This is a review of season 1 alone)\r\nCode Geass, but written by the guy who wrote Fate/Zero.\r\nCharacter: 4\r\nAldnoah.Zero is a story that values the plot over it's character. All the characters have a solid personality, and are distinct, but none of them really go through much development throughout the series. This is with the exception of Slaine Troyard, who goes through drastic and realistic character changes, and breaks the slap on definition of \"Good guy\" and \"Bad guy\". Nearly all the other characters are either a good guy, or a bad guy. And though they are fun to watch, they aren't very conflicting.\r\nStory: 7\r\nThe seriesdelivers a fun plot with a fair amount of twists and turns that can make your jaw drop. There is a bit of a lull in the middle, where everyone goes around just doing repetitive fights, but the fights are intelligently executed and fun to watch. The series starts off with a bang in the first couple episodes, is fun and enjoyable for the middle, and closes off with another bang that will most likely drop the jaws of most people watching.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThe 2D animation is very good, and can be beautiful at times. The series uses quite a lot of CGI. I personally think that CGI overall just can't do the same things 2D can, but in Aldnoah/Zero I actually didn't mind it. They did a better job with CG than I've seen any other anime do, and it actually folds rather well into the scenery.\\n\\n\r\nMusic and Sound: 5\\n\r\nI like the opening themes, but the soundtrack isn't really that memorable, and the sound effects do their job without really standing out. That being said, the music does fit the series well, it just doesn't really have anything special about it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI had a lot of fun watching this series. Had lots of twists and turns, and every episode made me want to watch another one. It does harbor several touching moments which made me tear up as well, and even during the mid-season lull, it had smart fights, enjoyable characters, and some very good moments of sentimentality.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nBeing written by Urobuchi, it has a lot of plot similarities to Fate/Zero, and a world and characters similar to those in Code Geass. If you liked either, you will probably at least have fun watching this series. I did, and I would say it was definitely worth the watch.",

            "content": "Aldnoah.Zero is a high stakes anime... with no stakes. \r\nStory: 4/10 \r\nThe story is predicated on the assassination of the princess of Vers (Mars) but it isn't engaging at all. During the whole series, she's essentially the character in the least amount of danger after the failed assassination attempt. A few minor changes would have made this anime a 7, 8, or even a 9. The removal of some minor character, some relationship links, some familial ties maybe. \r\n*spoiler - Ep 2*  Had Inaho's sister actually died, the MC would have had something riding on defeating the Vers knights.\r\nMost of the characters have theirown tragic reason for wanting to battle the Vers empire and end the war... everyone but the MC. He's just the brother of a pilot school instructor, who happens to be yet another Logan's Run-esque middle school aged messiah figure/tactical genius. He's comparatively good at maneuvering the bots, only because everyone else literally stands there shooting at things.\\n\\n\r\nThe story has zero stakes in play, every character is floating in the thin water soup that is the 'plot' of this anime, and in fact, many of them don't need to be there at all, namely Lt. Marito. I really could have given a shit about the fate of these characters. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10 \\n\r\nA typically visually pleasing anime from A-1 Productions. A little bit of same face different hair syndrome happening with a handful of the female characters, but hey, look at K-on, those girls are essentially the same person in four different wigs and most people like that anime. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: A sub-par storyline clearly doesn't have many compelling characters. 4/10\\n\r\nThe only character that has any inkling of development in these 12 episodes (though at the time of writing I've only seen 7 episodes because the plot is pretty transparent already) is Slaine, and that's only because he starts off as a spineless fanboy and becomes an almost three-dimensional character, almost.\\n\\n\r\nSound:8/10 \\n\r\nThe soundtrack during the lacklustre fight scenes almost makes you think something integral to the plot is happening; but of course, that's just the magic of a decent soundtrack. If not for the music, the fight scenes would have been at best, cringe-worthy.  \\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: Banal anime with barely any plot, cool enough art, and semi-decent characters, watch it if you're tired of animes with umm.. plots and character development I guess.",

            "content": "Bit of a rant coming here, I'm rather P-O'ed. \"Aldnoah.Zero\" is a big ol' swing and a miss at an attempt to make a great Anim\u00e9 genre. It hits all the boxes on the \"Do It Yourself\" Anim\u00e9 starter pack checklist:\r\nDoes it take place in a school?\r\nOnly early on, but they keep their uniforms the whole time. So, close enough. Check.\r\nIs the lead character a pretty, tomboyish, but still feminine girl or a super serious, spiky-haired boy?\r\nMinus the spikey hair, but so serious I thought it was gonna be revealed he was a Terminator. Check.\r\nIs there a supernatural or fantasy element that centers the plot?\r\n\"Aldnoah\"is pretty much slang for \"Magic plot device\". Check.\\n\\n\r\nAre there fight scenes with guns, handheld weapons, or magical powers?\\n\r\nGiant robots powered by magic! Check.\\n\\n\r\nIs there a mid-series break to make one season like two?\\n\r\nYes, but it's a doozy. Check.\\n\\n\r\nIs there an obligatory fan service episode at a pool/hot spring/beach so all the female characters can be seen in swimwear?\u00a0\\n\r\nMajor plot point happens in the shower. Check.\\n\\n\r\nHard to believe this is from Gen Urobuchi, who gave us \"Fate/Zero\" and \"Psycho Pass\" and many more. But, seeing it takes place in a dystopian future makes it rather obvious. Also rather obvious is the lack of originality in this series. So much been there, done that! Martians invade Earth. Giant robots. Man on a quest to save a Princess. Conspiracies.\u00a0It's a potpourri plot. That sucks.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is pretty standard, but it has it's moments. Supplemented by a lot of CG and some pretty decent SFX. The music is your standard \"let's add choirs to this \u00a0to make it sound really epic\" score. The sound effects are decent. \u00a0But, the characters- OMG WHAT A TRAIN WRECK! \u00a0Let's look at some of those featured at the Grand Central Station of disappointment:\\n\\n\r\nA main character so bland and boring, you could have replaced him with a block of tofu and gotten more emotion.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nThe faithful servant who must save his Princess. (Holy Link, Batman!)\\n\\n\r\nThe Princess who is beautiful, naive, pure hearted, magical, and only wants to do good and make peace but now everyone wants to kill her. (complete with her obligatory maid who's job it is to follow and guard her like a puppy while constantly repeating, \"Your highness...\").\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nThe ex-soldier with PTSD who drinks too much.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nThe comic relief best friend who acts like a goof in front of ladies.\\n\\n\r\nAnd bad guys who's job it is to be bad snobby and evil. They are so one-note, they make Disney villains seem subtle and complex! The most interesting character in this show is Rayet. But just because everyone else sucks. Sub vs. Dub goes to Sub by default. The Japanese cast is decent, the English cast is lousy. Dishonorable mention goes to Eddelrittuo, who is voiced by the human squeak toy that is Sandy Fox (stick to Betty Boop!)\\n\\n\r\nThe strongpoint of the show is it's really cool mechs called \"Kataphrekts\". The bad guy suits are big, powerful, intimidating, and wipe out most of Earth's generic looking cannon fodder suits providing a bit of sweet, sweet, 'splosion porn that mech fans live for. The excitement stems from seeing how they're gonna defeat each seemingly invincible foe that shows up. And it's usually done using sound tactics that are believable. Shame the writers couldn't have used those smarts to come up with something more original than a flying battleship! Grr...\\n\\n\r\nThe reason I didn't completely bury this season was because of a strong and balsy ending. The kind of shocking moment you expect from a work of Gen Urobuchi's. It took some guts and outside the box thinking to do something like that. The show needed more of that and less re-hashed crap. Actually, the show needed more than that, but it saves it from a failing grade. I write this review with clean eyes, having not seen Season 2, so this is only an indictment on the first season and not the show in general. 5/10 (I'm being generous) Check it out if you like mechs or want to fill out your MAL profile. Cheers hoping Season 2 is better!",

            "content": "WARNING: This review will contain early spoilers, and is probably more of a rant than an actual review (also it's my first review so please don't butcher me).\r\nA main character is the core of a story, as most screen time occurs around them and their perspective. \r\nAldnoah shifts between multiple perspectives, so I am willing to give it some leeway, however it is undeniable that Inaho (the protagonist of this story) is easily one of the most poorly written MCs. \r\nIf you can overlook the poor story and character design, then you might enjoy this anime, just don't expect too much.\r\nTo simply describe the protagonist,he is a self-insert 'Mary-Sue' genius who can achieve anything. I'm not against intelligent characters, I'm against intelligent characters written by stupid people- the protagonist might as well be some kind of magician who knows his enemies' exact next moves.\\n\r\nHave you had enough? But wait, there's more! \\n\r\nHe gets a bionic eye which further leads him down the path of Mary-Sue. Of course with this excellent writing there would be tremendous side effects- wait, there aren't? Just the occasional \"ow my eye hurts\" for a few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nNot to mention his bland and apathetic personality that makes him less of a character and more of a plot device- speaking of plot devices, one of his friends dies right in front of his eyes, and what reaction does that leave? The heroic \"I will avenge you\" before he pilots a training mecha to take down an advanced alien weapon. Let me emphasize this. A HIGH SCHOOL student takes out an enemy which groups TRAINED soldiers and veterans couldn't harm at all. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe story then continues to him killing aliens with advanced weapons, while using inferior technology, over a failed assassination attempt and misunderstanding. Of course everyone is too stubborn (or stupid) to actually try to peacefully put an end to the war, or even reveal that the princess is alive.\\n\\n\r\nMost characters don't attribute anything to the story, and only a handful of main characters are actually important.\\n\\n\r\nTo end on a positive note, the animation and art are very good- especially with the heavy action scenes- and the music is also good. I found myself listening to the music even when writing this review (rant).",

            "content": "When Earthlings finally stepped foot onto Mars, they discovered an ancient power known as Aldnoah. This power somehow transferred itself into the blood/DNA of the explorers and now an entire empire exists on Mars, built around the powerful technology. Unfortunately, tensions are at an all time high between the Martians and Earthlings, with Martians operating assault fortresses orbiting the Earth, ready to pound the planet at the first sign of provocation. That spark ends up being a peaceful visit by the Martian princess, who is seemingly blown to bits in an unprovoked terrorist attack. War is at hand.\r\nFor ages, we've watched mech shows where theprotagonist is given great powers and must defeat unprecedented numbers of opponents to achieve victory. In A/Z, that premise is turned upside down; the Earth-dwellers must use archaic, outmatched machines to defeat seemingly invincible enemy mechs known as cataphracts. Huge losses are taken by the Earthlings just to stall one of these. Enter our protagonist Inaho, an intelligent reincarnation of the lead from Persona 4. He uses inference and his surroundings in order to even the odds against the Aldnoah-powered Martial cataphracts. The story follows both forces as the war proceeds.\\n\\n\r\nA/Z is a mech-based action thriller with numerous twists and a cliff hanger attached to the end of every episode. It is an engaging watch as for once you're rooting for the underdogs, and constantly figuring out how they'll make it through the next battle. This continues to be the theme all the way up to the end of the first season, which ends on the mother of all cliffhangers. However, from that point, the series starts to grow old as patterns are repeated and space battles end up being your typical beam spam war.\\n\\n\r\nA/Z could have been the start of an awesome franchise but ended up feeling like little more than Valvrave. By all means, it's a very exciting watch, but the actual character development, especially with antagonists, was pitiful at best. If you're looking for a great action show, this is definitely a good choice. If you're looking for something to rival the best of the Gundam franchise, you're going to be disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nThere isn't anything to complain about in this section, well maybe perhaps the mech designs. I guess I should be happy that they don't look like beetles, but the mechs aren't exactly what I call pretty; they almost remind me a bit of the Arbalest from FMP. I was initially so turned off by the orange mech that I almost skipped the entire show. Mechs aside, the show has very good production values. Expect a modern look with great shading and effects. The show is drawn in a slightly under-saturated palette that gives it an appropriately desperate feel. There is great attention to detail be it in the backgrounds or how mechs are damaged and destroyed. There is extensive usage of CGI in many of the mech fights, but it's pretty good quality and not all that distracting. The only weird thing for me was that the backrests in the Martian cataphracts looks like the inside of a coffin, perhaps on purpose? There are many characters, but all the important characters are reasonably distinguishable. Expressions are very good overall except for our virtually emotionless protagonist and his rival, Slaine.\\n\\n\r\nExpect a hearty dosage of action in this show, the majority of which is mech based; there are a few gun battles on foot as well however. The choreography is very good, especially early in the show where every battle is pretty desperate. Expect the protagonists to always barely escape death. Speaking of death, there is a lot of blood and dying, usually of unimportant or unnamed fighters. You should also expect a protracted battle at the climax. This show isn't ecchi based; don't even expect a Flay-like character as character development seems secondary.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe sound production values are likewise high. I didn't really take a liking to either of the two OPs, but all of the EDs (with the exception of the last episode) were exceptionally good. The BGM is also very good, with a wide range of melodies ranging from the calming to the chaotic. It is used to great effect particularly in the battles. There is definitely a central melody along with a uniquely electronic feel. In addition to the music, expect great sound effects as well, examples include shells bouncing off the ground and grossly realistic throw up.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThe story takes a very Gundam-like approach, where seemingly insignificant individuals end up having profound effects on the entire war effort. It also continues the Earth vs. colonies theme and attempts a rivalry between Inaho and Slaine, which seems to attempt to mirror something like Kira and Athrun from Gundam Seed; unfortunately, in this case that attempt falls very short.\\n\\n\r\nYou'll see the world presented from two viewpoints, that of our protagonist Inaho and company as well as that of Slaine. Expect a lot of ironies and some political banter, especially from the Martian crew. The story is very clearly divided into two seasons, each of which builds to an astronomical climax. Be prepared to start the second season immediately upon finishing the first season, as the cliffhanger is a big one. However, the tempo in the second season feels very different as it first undoes quite a bit of the first season. It doesn't feel as interesting in that the antagonist's rise to power is both rushed and unnatural. Inaho's originally unique take to battle by now has grown old and so it just feels like more of the same.\\n\\n\r\nThe second season also concludes in a very weird way; it feels like they wasted a lot of potential with the route that they followed. To say that I was disappointed is a huge understatement; really, what was all the fighting and bloodshed even for? There are a lot of particulars that I think went horrifically wrong in the second season, but almost all of them involve spoilers in some way or another. If I had to liken what they did in comparison with another show, I'd say the second season of A/Z is similar to the third season of Shakugan no Shana.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThere are some likeable characters in this show; it's just that they all happen to be supportive characters or characters that spend the majority of the show in a tank. Though the show had good attention to individual traits, it really didn't portray either Inaho or Slaine in a positive light. Inaho is an emotionless and calculating killing machine who fights to end the war as soon as possible. Slaine is a mysterious and capable fighter who suddenly becomes an incredible force one presented a mech; Slaine also harbors psychological issues and is infatuated with his own perception of princess Asseylum. Compared to the dynamic nature of characters in other shows, this one falls very short.\\n\\n\r\nThe show spends a significant portion of the first season developing character relationships, many of these interesting relationships (not necessarily romantic) in the first season are basically ignored in the second season. As for ease of relating, the primary cast fairs pretty poorly. Even worse are the antagonists who are barely developed as they often just end up being Inaho-fodder. Besides, isn't it weird to send your generals, alone, in front of the rest of one's forces?\\n\\n\r\nValue:\\n\r\nA/Z is like one long roller coaster. At first, it is thrilling and exciting. However, by the end you're just swaying with the turns and really just want the ride to end. To be honest, I was totally prepared to give the show a raving review after the first season. However, the second season wasn't what I had hoped for; it was unable to run with the exciting tempo of the first season and it decided to take a lot of weird turns. That being said, it is still probably one of the more exciting mech shows out there. If you can put up with a story that turns sour in the center and sub-interesting characters, this is an entertaining show. However, if you're looking for the best of the mech experiences, I'd still stick with the Gundam franchise.",

            "content": "Despite being a frequent reviewer on other sites such as YouTube, the anime I set out to watch and review generally please me in some manner or another, with varying degrees of enjoyment. And when I started this show, I had good expectations. But, it dropped off like a cliff and smashed into the ground, splattering whatever creativity it had all over.\r\nFirst of all, one of the only decent elements of the show is the story, because it is interesting and engaging. The idea of these two colonies of Mars and Earth going to war is a pretty good idea, and while the execution ofit does leave quite a bit to be desired considering the strong idea, I can't say it ruined the anime.\\n\\n\r\nNo, that job was done by the characters. Most of them were pretty boring while leaving little impression, but the biggest punch in the nuts was from Inaho. The job of the main character is to be the captain of the ride, the one who leads the coaster through the story. They're supposed to be the one we identify with. Well, it's incredibly hard, if not impossible, to identify with or even care about a character who shows no emotion whatsoever. He shows no caring whenever he's in a fight, and even when one of his friends DIES (not really a spoiler, it happens very early on), he doesn't seem to even care. I've heard excuses, like how he is a high functioning autistic. Which is fine, but there is NO reason for it. I can see an autistic character being interesting, but here it just severely hurts any chance this character has of being likable. He is incredibly bland with few if no identifying traits to make him stand out. So this leaves the audience to the side characters, and the only one really worth watching was princess Asseylum, and even she was only just okay. And the villains, the characters that could've almost saved it, were completely forgettable and left so much to be desired, with weak motivations and few interesting traits. So, the anime fails on the character portion, which might I add, is a key part of any medium.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was fine enough for the most part, and the character designs were okay, but the kicker was the CGI animation. It wasn't very good, and the mech designs were pretty uninspired and bland. The action scenes weren't all that engaging. It's also particularly hard for action to be intriguing if there is no real weight to it. Inaho is almost always on top of things, and this would be GREAT if it was an over the top action that has a lot of comedy and satirical elements, maybe like One Punch Man. But this is supposed to be serious. The characters are almost never in danger, so it isn't serious. It's a waste of time with flashy colors and mediocre CGI robots fighting each other.\\n\\n\r\nThe best element of the show is the music, which was actually really good. There was even one track in particular that almost fooled me into almost enjoying the show, until I re-watched it and realized that I was mostly enjoying the songs instead of what was happening.\\n\\n\r\nNeedless to say, the anime was not fun. Not completely awful, because there were a few elements that worked, but it was bogged down by such a poor cast and action that wasn't engaging. There was potential here, but it was not reached, not even to a level that made it a fun product. Instead, Aldnoah.Zero is one of the weakest anime I've ever seen, and should definitely just be skipped.",

            "content": "This review is for the entire series (season I & II)\r\ngenre: Thriller, Action, Tragedy, Way of life!\r\nIt might be strange coming from someone who is giving a 6-point rating.. but this show is totally underrated! many compare this anime with tengen touppa and gundam series. but i haven't seen any of those.. So this story is a original and new for me.\r\nThis is one of those shows that has an epic start, but a miserable end. If u r thinking weather or not to watch it, then trust me when I say- it's definitely worth your time! well that is if u can bear withthe bad ending (the last episode in season II). It's really good until then.\\n\\n\r\n*mild spoilers*\\n\r\ncons:\\n\r\n-hero is over powered. he's just a normal human like any other. yet, he's the only one who is capable of defeating the enemies.\\n\r\n-the princess's action and behavior is unaccounted for. there is a love triangle and she suddenly abandons her childhood friend, who always cared for her and only lived for her. His feelings never reached her. that's one of the reason why i gave a low rating.\\n\r\n-*spoiler*the hero suddenly betrays trust on this childhood friend(who is later proclaimed as a villain) without a justified reason. Then, Why the hell is he 'the hero'?\\n\\n\r\npros:\\n\r\n-I learned a lot of science from this anime.. Leidenfrost effect, Meissner effect, etc.\\n\r\n-The battles are quite epic and really intellectual.\\n\r\n-The story line drastically changes on the 2nd season. it was really enjoyable to see how this childhood friend managed every hardship that he faced.\\n\\n\r\n*extreme spoiler*\\n\r\nP.S. this anime could have been a lot better, if they at least tried a little to think of a better ending. Even the death of slain could have been better than imprisoning him and making him live and repent for a crime he is not responsible for..",

            "content": "This isn't going to be a very long review since I don't plan on going super in depth, just know that there will be spoilers.\r\nI hadn't had high hopes for this anime from the beginning, it was one that I'd looked at and thought \"I'll watch that while I'm waiting for episodes of other continuing anime .\" but even so I didn't expect it to be /this/ poor.\r\nIt starts off fine and then nose dives into the ground; the plot doesn't make sense, the soundtrack was alright but used poorly (e.g. the same song used for every battle), and the characters make irrational and nonsensicalactions compared to their knowledge and beliefs, you can just tell that these decisions were made by the writer and not the character to shoehorn in some \"emotional\" or \"gosh what'll happen now\" moments.\\n\\n\r\nI think what annoyed me most was the story though. You start off thinking it's some cout d'etat by the Vers people framing the death of their Princess on Earth, which is fine, it's a good starting point for a story. My first problem with this is that you discover that only /two people/ of the entire fleet are genuinely nice and want the Princess to live...just two? Really?\\n\r\nMoving on from that you much later find out that the ringleader behind all this has a personal vendetta against Earth, namely his wife-to-be was killed by humans-- but oh wait, later he explains himself further;\\n\r\nIt turns out that the Vers people were panicking 'cus Mars ain't a great place to live (which in of itself is bullshit, though I won't get into the science aspect of things) and the Vers royalty were ignoring their people's suffering, to save their own skins the Vers royalty lies to their people and turns them against Earth, they send a landing party to check how good Earth's military is which includes ringleader and wife-to-be. You'd think here is where wife-to-be gets killed by humans right? WRONG. Humans turn out to be no match for the Vers technology and they are winning, when all of a sudden the gate on the moon they'd used to get from Mars to Earth blows up and shatters the moon in the process. Bits of the moon smash into the Earth, wife-to-be is unfortunately killed by moon chunks, the end.\\n\\n\r\nSo...why the fuck does the ringleader hate Earth again? Does he blame Earth for the moon spontaneously exploding? How does \"chunk of moon killed wife-to-be\" translate to \"humans killed wife-to-be\"? If it was the royalty that messed things up in the first place and the ringleader knows this, why is he going to war with Earth at all? Surely this cause should start a civil war right?\\n\\n\r\n...You see my problem with the story here? There is no motive. The more the reasons behind the attack were explained the less sense it made.",

As far as the story, and the development of it goes, it is a crapy one.Practically there's no trascendental message, and the main characters never trully face a problem that makes you sweat. The thing that makes this anime exciting is all the action that has in it, i LOVED the art and OMFG the soundtrack !! \r\nI recomend this anime if you're a mecha fan, or if you want to watch an action anime that doesn't require you to use yourbrain. \\n\\n",
