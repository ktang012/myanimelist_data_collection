            "content": "\"INCESTUOUS HOMOSEXUALS!\"\r\nT'Was my first impression on this anime but fortunately it has none of that.\r\nHoshizora e Kakaru Hashi or in English, A Bridge to the Starry Skies, or in the French, Un pont vers le ciel \u00e9toil\u00e9 (everything sound sexier in French) is based on a visual novel made by Feng whom I'm not familiar with any other works. (Known for making the visual novel Akane Iro, which was then adapted into an anime, that was a disaster) Having finished this galge using a lousy translator program that killed every emotional scene that the eroge had to offer (Yes, you know I'm talking about youATLAS and AGTH!) I've decided to watch the anime to displace that horrible, horrible visual novel translations with better subs.\\n\\n\r\nSo if you're a hardcore follower of \"Way of the Harem\" you should know by now that every typical Harem lead must somehow \"dispose\" of his parents. This statement stands true for Hoshino Kazuma, our Harem lead. But unlike other harem animes, his parents absence is actually feasible. They're not on a world tour or fighting aliens or working overseas... Kazuma and his younger brother were sent to the countryside because of his younger brother's health condition and it was mention in the anime that his parents \"will join them eventually..\" Sounds plausible.\\n\\n\r\nIn this new town, he met a girl, fell on top of a girl, kissed a girl, called a pervert, caught naked, got teased for a small d*ck  and the list goes on. A cliche harem story you say? NOT SO FAST! (Feng apparently have a fetish for accidental kiss. Nothing wrong about it. That's as close as you can get to non-jail-able sexual harassment) \\n\\n\r\nI've decided not to review this anime based on the visual novel. In defense of harem animes being critized by it's cliche-ness and never ending quest to satisfy our \"fan-service\" needs, I shall judge a harem anime as a class of it's own, not to be compared with other types of genres. Thus I present to you, \"The Harem Deviation Calculator\"\\n\\n\r\nUsing the following formula\\n\r\nH= 3/(n-2) x (N!/n) x (Y)^1/2 - TK\u03c1\\n\\n\r\nWhere..\\n\r\nH represents the Harem Score\\n\r\nn represents the number of girls in the harem\\n\r\nN represents the number of different type of girls\\n\r\nY represents the dependency of the male harem lead\\n\r\nK represents the magnitude of \u201ccockblockers\u201d\\n\r\n\u03a1 represents the dense-ness of the male harem lead\\n\r\nT represents the cohesion of the fellow female members\\n\\n\r\nLet's begin shall we?\\n\\n\r\nNumber of girls in the harem:\\n\r\nA total of six main girls and two subs. And one little brother.\\n\\n\r\nTypes of girls: [This will be a simplified version]\\n\\n\r\nNakatsugawa Ui\\n\r\nAirhead[\u2713], Big Appetite[\u2713], Older brother complexity[\u2713], First Kiss[\u2713] \\n\r\nFirst Girl Rule[\u2713] \\n\\n\r\nHinata Ibuki\\n\r\nArcher girl[\u2713], Possessive[\u2713], Anti-Pervert[\u2713], Tsundere[\u2713]\\n\\n\r\nKoumoto Madoka\\n\r\nMiko[\u2713], Androphobic[\u2713], Shy[\u2713], Childhood friend[\u2713], BOING![\u2713] \\n\r\nFriendzoned[\u2713] \\n\\n\r\nSakai Hina\\n\r\nYuri-able[\u2713], Elegent[\u2713], Soft toy fetish[\u2713], Enjoys talking to in-animated objects[\u2713], self-conscious[\u2713] \\n\\n\r\nToudou Tsumugi\\n\r\nOlder Sister[\u2713], School Idol[\u2713], Clumsy[\u2713] , hard working[\u2713] \\n\\n\r\nToudou Koyori\\n\r\nStrong will[\u2713], energetic[\u2713], kind[\u2713], tomboy[\u2713], Innocent[\u2713]\\n\\n\r\nHoshino Ayumu\\n\r\nWait hold it... Oh thank god. I almost mistaken his younger brother into his harem.. \\n\r\nWell as you can see the characters are greatly varied however I am shocked that a glasses girl isn't present. It's a great loss for glasses fan everywhere...\\n\\n\r\nDependency:\\n\r\nWell Kazuma is reliable enough to take care of his younger brother, thus gives him a significant amount of credit for this. Although he does not have any super power or super human abilities, he is athletic so I guess that counts in a way towards his dependency score.\\n\\n\r\nCockblockers: Low\\n\r\nYorozu Senka, the lady in charge of the inn where the Hoshi brothers are staying. Probably the first non-blood relative to have saw Kazuma's other little brother (You know what I'm talking about) Although she supports Kazuma having healthy relationships with other girls, her positive attitude might just instill more awkwardness between the Kazuma and his \"choosen\" girl. Other than that, he does not have a younger sister which would mean less \"caught in the act\" events. (Though I rarely see a younger brother in harem genre before)\\n\\n\r\nDense-ness: Moderate\\n\r\nModerately dense. He is aware of some of the girls' feelings for him. (But not all of them)\\n\\n\r\nCohesion: High\\n\r\nAll the girls are on friendly terms with each other. Well yeah, this is quite common in a harem. But the plus point is that if one of them got into a relationship with the main harem lead, I can assure you, yanderes won't be present. (Which means no severed heads and boat rides) nor would he have to cut ties with any of them.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall, what is the verdict?\\n\r\n[HAREM EXPECTATION INDEX METER]\\n\r\n-HOSHINO KAZUMA- HAPPY HAPPY FUN TIME\\n\r\nPositive but still a cliched harem (low deviation score)\\n\\n\r\nSo there you have it. Fairly nothing exceptionally interesting ever happened in the anime. Art and sound wise is just slightly above the average line. Characters do not really have a noticeable impact on the audience. There's also a lacking amount of fan-service thus reducing the enjoyment score for those who actually was hoping for it. But if you find yourself wanting to contribute to the research of harem genres, then go ahead and watch this.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading,\\n\r\nHaremu Kingu,\\n\r\nSigning off!",

            "content": "Hoshizora e Kakaru Hashi is an anime based off the visual novel of the same name. I haven't played that visual novel, more specifically I don't play visual novels at all, so I cannot comment on the coherence of the adaptation. Instead, I am going to analyze and critique this anime as a standalone work.\r\nHoshizora e Kakaru Hashi tells the story of two brothers who are in the process of moving homes. As they're looking for a place to stay, the older brother (Kazuma) gets lost in a forest. He meets a girl, and of course, he ends up \"accidentally\" kissing her. This is thebeginning of the girl, Ui, and Kazuma's romantic relationship. They also happen to go to the same school; good lord, the coincidences. And that's about it. The entire story is about how Ui and Kazuma will manage to confess their love for each other; exactly why I give the story a \"5\". Not surprising, though, as this is a visual novel adaptation after all.\\n\\n\r\nThis isn't to say that the story is completely smooth as I made it out to be; there are a few edges in this anime's romance, it isn't just a straight line. In the end, you could see where the story was going, and the characters were fairly easy to read. To be honest, Hoshizora could've been something great if it weren't so linear. It has beautiful art, an amazing opening, and a likeable set of characters. It's just a shame that its story is so bland; don't expect too much when you're watching this anime. There is also never any sort of major conflict. Despite that, it is still a refreshing anime that you can unwind and relax while watching. Hoshizora e Kakaru Hashi is not a bad anime in the slightest, and there are some bright moments within it. Overall, an enjoyable watch that is unfortunately shallow.",

            "content": "Hoshizora e Kakaru Hashi has somewhat a natural feel for being a harem anime, it is a harem, romance, comedy, and a little bit of ecchi making it somewhat an average harem. \r\nStory: 8\r\nAs seen in the sypnosis the main character Kazuma moved to a small town from the city. And he accidentaly kisses Ui and Ibuki saw them and so Kazuma's new life begins in the school where he transferred and make matters worse Ibuki and Ui is his classmate .\r\nArt: 9\r\nArt. Some people don't love the design of the arts in other anime but Hoshizora e Kakaru Hashi is one of the bestart i have ever seen the background is nice it's well detailed and because it's a small town there's not much building you will see in this anime.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nReally love the sound. Sound effects is nice. The opening song is one of my favorites really nice. Also the voice in each character for me fits really well for them. Each voice for each character make me think that somewhat it's their natural voice it really fits them well.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nThe design on the characters is really unique. All i can say about them is their really cute. You'll really fall for them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoymant: 10 \\n\r\nYes, I enjoy watching this anime the story keeps getting better as more episode are release, more lovey-dovey are unravelling, more flashback are surfacing. So yeah you'll enjoy it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nYes i give it a 9 because the design on the characters are unique. The sound is nice. The anime is well detailed. The story keeps getting better as more episode are release. more romantic moments so it's really enjoyable.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis is my first review that i have ever written so i'm sorry if there is some mistake that i have written really sorry and i'll try to be more better as i write more reviews. Thanks!! HOSHIZORA E KAKARU HASHI IS REALLY ENJOYABLE!",

(and more down to Earth - not that the angel/demon thing bugged me too much).\r\nThe first episode was astounding, the art was the first thing I noticed and let's be honest, it desevers a 10.\r\nMore importantly, the art is similar to Studio Key so my hopes increased tenfold\r\n(Think Kanon2006, Clannad, Air...See what I did there?)\\n\\n\r\nHigh hopes heh?\\n\\n\r\nWell let me tell you that my sweet little dream about a more realistic and mature Shuffle! was crushed to smithereens and thrown into the deepest pit of Tartarus.\\n\\n\r\nNo plot, no character development, not a seinen (FAR from being a seinen), no nothing except free fan service. If you're denying this fact, you're just lying to yourself. \\n\\n\r\nI honestly gave it a 3 just because of the art, otherwise this show can be labeled as an epic failure or a big pile of rotten shit.\\n\r\nAm I mad? Oh yeah I'm mad, wasting a potentially kick ass anime just for this? Definitely the worst let down I ever experienced.\\n",

            "content": "\"Dont judge anime if you havent watching all the episode\" LESSON LEARNED~\r\nWhy would i say that? First, like the other reviewer said, the first impression that you will get was \"Incestous Homosexual\" but praise to the lord and the creator of this anime, the anime wasnt about that.\r\nHoshizora e Kakaru Hashi or A Bridge to the Starry Skies (kinda weird name) is like your usual generic harem anime which we have a bunch of cute girls and one boy that being liked by many girls. what means \"like your usual generic harem anime\"? USUALLY or we can said ALWAYS, harem anime didnt have any romanticending or get laid (based on all harem anime that i have watched). and not just that, USUALLY my perspective about harem anime was :\\n\r\n- Have a little sister that have brother complex\\n\r\n- Being liked by ALL of the girls in anime itself (sometimes they liked without any logical reasons)\\n\r\n- Surrounded by beautiful girls\\n\r\n- The girls usually have their own uniqueness (tsundere, dandere, and kuudere) (if you're looking for yandere, then it wouldnt be a harem anime, it would be a horror  anime) LOL\\n\r\n- The MC usually at the end didnt get laid or girlfriends (For all the harem lover will know what i mean)\\n\\n\r\nAnd why i am saying all that meaningless words? FYI, HoKaHa (since the title is so long) is really crossing my perspective about harem anime. its something unique yet its not so amazing too. Why? for the first i have a problem with the story itself, while watching this anime episode after episode, many question clinging into my mind \"What is the actual story/main story?\"  \"Did this anime focus on the LUCKY BASTARD kiss incident or about the MC's little brother sick?\" and until the last episode i still dont get what this story about, what i know is the last episode is really surprise me. A LOT.\\n\\n\r\n\"Oh so this anime didnt have any main plot, so whats so good about this anime since you rated it 7?\"\\n\r\nCalm down, yeah it doesnt have any strong plot or main plot, and just what we know is when we're watching this anime was the MC moving to that village because of  the little brother (he is have some MYSTERIOUS disease that until now i dont know what disease that he have) and then he got a kiss incident with a stranger girl. Ok you can imagine that.... i give you a time for imagining it.\\n\\n\r\nDone? lets process to the reason why i think this anime was good, for the first HoKaHa really suprise me in many ways, it crossess all of my expectation about what harem anime was (see all the list that what my perspective about harem anime in beginning of this review). then HoKaHa was surprising and sometimes it have a touchy and some moments that will make us smile or maybe jiggle a bit. i must say it was amusing and really worth of my 300 Minutes or 5 hours (12 episode x 25 minutes).\\n\\n\r\nAfter we talk about the story, lets talk about the other aspects, Art. I can't say to much about this one, but for sure, the quality of art in this anime was so amazing, On the first episode we can see a beautiful drawing in the forest, amazing scenery and even the water flows was like the real one. Well, its not the best, but atleast it will not make your eyes bored.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the sound section, well it was so - so. since i dont find any amazing sound that happen in this anime, from the OP, the ED or in the voice actors it was like any other harem anime, it was not really good and it wasnt really bad either, so we can said \"normal\". LOL\\n\\n\r\nAnd for the closing, i must said it was very amusing harem anime, what else do you need?\\n\r\n- Harem,check ; romance, check; comedy, check; dere girls, check; GET LAID; check!\\n\\n\r\nif you're looking for an unusual harem anime, this maybe the right anime for you, cheers!",

            "content": "*Falling over the girl* *looks in her eyes almost mouth close*\r\n                 -Romantic Scene-\r\nFor me its the first time the guy falls over the girl and kisses her (accidently). And I've seen many Romance Series..\r\nIt's another romance with some Comedy. I'm starting to see less and less unique ones.\r\nKEEP IN MIND Only 2 episodes have been released which this review is based on.\r\n(For a quicker review, check Overall)\r\nStory: 7\r\nHe accidentally trips and falls over her and gives her a good sweet accidental kiss while Ui's best friend Hinata sees this.HENTAI!\\n\\n\r\nComment: This was not very original at all, but the story gets more interesting. And many might thinks prob \"Ui is gonna be the love of his life in the end, BOORING\" but no, as you watch, he meets a lot of girls that gives impressions and you are never sure, trust me.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not bad. I'm always interested in seeing if the Writer will end it with the first most obvious (the kiss), or totally blow my mind when perhaps a guy get feelings for the one you did not expect.\\n\r\nAnd I love the conflicts and the humor from these.\\n\r\nIt does not have Comedy added to the Genre in Info, but there is full of Comedy in here.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThis art is similar to Clannad, or Kanon 2006. Bigger eyes and huge hair.\\n\r\nIt's nicely done with many colours. I think the school suits are pretty cute and nicely formed. And the characters look good and matches personality with the art.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nI mean wow. This Opening theme sounds better then most i've heard. Love the flute. Its not totally original but its a lot better then some series out there that sound exactly the same.\\n\r\nThe voices on girls are OFC typical high pitch. Witch I have nothing against, i think its cute if its just not overused. Which this series doesnt :) Thumbs Up.\\n\r\nWhats funny is Ayumu has the same voice and is supposed to be an onormally cute little brother that does not seem to be Kazumas brother at all.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nEven tho you might have seen this type of Romance Comedy Harem before, it's actually hard to compare it. All the characters have unique sides which surprises me because it wasn't expected.\\n\r\nI like the little super cute brother thing he got going on, and Hinata is one special girl being best friends with Ui.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI enjoy it a lot. I'm very interested in Romance Comedies and have seen a lot.\\n\r\nSo far, the beginning was just great with the kiss. It usally stopps before he reaches all the way. But not here! It WANTS you to keep watching and you prob will at least for a while since cmon, something more gotta happan! Is what you would think..\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7 or 8\\n\r\n7 or 8, depending on how it continues. \\n\r\nI'm enjoying it and this series is good. It's short and prob wont have a sequal. So it's just one more nice little series to be watching.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like Romance, Harem, Comedy with added Romance, you will love this.\\n\r\nIf you have High Anime Compatibility with me you will probably like this.\\n\\n\r\n*The story is typical for RomCom but surprisingly have unique sides. (Story does have comedy)\\n\r\n*The art is very well done and gives a feeling of Clannad or Kanon 2006.\\n\r\n*The Opening was surprisingly better and more original then most ones. Cute and fitting voices.\\n\r\n*Characters have personal and unique sides. If you have seen RomHarem before you prob will not like it as much. But give it a shot.\\n\r\n*I enjoyed it. This is one of the more compelling ones.\\n\\n\\n",

I just had a fun time watching it, and it'll be my Summer Anime to watch along with Air, so don't think that I'm overrating things, because I really loved this anime.\r\nStory: 8\r\nStory of boy meets girl, so pretty normal, but the entire anime is full of comedy, romance, you know, normal stuff for harem animes. But I was amazingly satisfied with the ending, so watch it, you'll know what I mean.\r\nArt: 10\r\nI loved the art, in fact, this anime had the best artwork I've ever seen in ananime. I love the design of the characters, but their eyes were beautifully drawn, multicolored, which was more realistic, and prettier to look at, and then the scenery was realistic too, the streams and trees looked real.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\\n\r\nI love the cast, because they act out the characters so well, and then there's the music, which I'm a huge fan of, especially \"Mighty Girl Power de\" and \"Horoscope Nomico\". Both really good songs.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\\n\r\nThere are almost always characters in animes that I can't stand, such as Renge from \"Ouran HighSchool Host Club\", but this anime had no characters that I wanted to beat up. I loved every single character, and I'm a huge fan of Ui and Ibuki. The characters are all fun to watch in action, and I love their personalities.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nEasy 10. I didn't hate any of the episodes at all, and I've rewatched the series numerous times. It never gets old.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe story could have been the slightest bit better, and that's pretty much the only reason it doesn't get a 10 from me. Don't get me wrong, this anime is in my top 10. I recommend it for almost all people who liked Negima!?, Maburaho, Nagasarete Airantou, etc.",

            "content": "This is a really cute romance show that I will probably want to re-watch again in a year or two (that way I forget the details).\r\nThe story evolves around a boy named Kazuma who once visited this small town and now, 10 years later, has to live there, but the only memories he has of this small town was his short time that was spent playing with a girl. On his arrival to the town, his little brothers hat gets stolen by a forest monkey and Kazuma then chases it far into the forest. Finally, getting the hat he stumbles upon a girl name Ui,who was out gathering vegetables in the forest. On the way back to the bus station, they had to cross a small stream and the only way across is to hop on some stones, but when Kazuma tried to cross the stream, he slips and lands on top of Ui effectively stealing her first kiss.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's how it all starts.\\n\r\nAt first, I thought it was kind of lame, but I guess the beginning could've been worse.\\n\\n\r\nStory ~6/10~\\n\r\nOverall, the story isn't unique, but it has it's good points to it. A boy going around proving his worth to several girls in his school and to turn around and not realize any of their feelings... sounds quite familiar.\\n\r\nBut I still cried like a baby and laughed occasionally.\\n\\n\r\nArt~7/10~\\n\r\nThe art isn't something worth jumping off a cliff for, it has flaws here and there, but overall I would give it 7/10. The backgrounds were well drawn and I didn't get blurry vision (like I do watching some animes), so that's a plus. I guess the art is like the music, easily forgettable. The art has its own tone and gets the story across quite well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter ~5/10~\\n\r\nThis is where the originality completely disappears. The characters you'll see in this anime are the same characters you've seen a million times. 2 stubborn athletic girls, one who is extremely shy, one who is shy because of her height and another shy girl who (happened to be the girl Kazuma met 10 years ago).\\n\r\nSo, the characters are either the two extremes, shy or in-your-face. If you can find some originality in that... I'll cook you dinner.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give this a 9/10. I enjoyed this show and I do recommend it. My review cannot simply tell you the experience I had watching this show. I just hope others find it as good as I did. The first episode might seem like a big disappointment because of how the story starts, but after that, the story doesn't seem so bad.\\n\\n\r\nIt's worth giving a shot.",

            "content": "Even though almost all harem anime are very similar (in terms of plot and characters), at least most of them have a little unique element to help separate themselves from others. This is not the case with Hoshizora e Kakaru Hashi, this anime is probably one of the most generic series out there. There is just nothing about this series that pops out.\r\nHoshizora e Kakaru Hashi starts out like most harems, the protagonist has just moved into a new town and then has the accidental kiss with the main heroine of the story. After getting introduced to all the characters, the protagonist gets one onone time with each girl and helps solve each of their problems. Finally, the main characters  realize their true feelings for each other and that's pretty much the whole series. This series is pretty cliche after cliche after cliche, nothing special ever happens (a problem that many harem series suffer from). Another problem is that the feelings that the main characters have for each other seem to come out of nowhere .The reason for this is that there is very little development between the two main characters because most of the time is spent on the other girls. At least the ending offers closure instead of leaving the ending up in the air. There really isn't anything else to say, everything about this anime has been used in many other harem series already. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are also very one dimensional and generic. The main hero of the series, Kazuma, is very kind and always helps others with their problems, and this turns into the quality that makes others fall for him, very much like many other protagonists in other harem series. A positive about the main character is that he is not extremely dense making him more likable. The main female in this anime, Ui, is actually the most unique character of the bunch because she has more traits than the rest of the cast, but that really isn't saying much. Her character is still very generic and not that interesting at all. Also some of her features may turn some people off.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters pretty much have the same personality as the characters in many other harems, give or take some minor features. They are all likeable in their own way but again nothing stands out.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound are fairly good, everything is certainly colorful and backgrounds are pretty nice. The sound is what you could expect from other harems, an upbeat and catchy opening and ending.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment all depends on the viewer, if you don't mind watching a harem then this would be another one to check off the list. It is still mildly enjoyable as long as you aren't looking for too much. \\n\\n\r\nHoshizora e Kakaru Hashi is the very definition of a generic harem series. Has nothing unique about it and if you have seen even one harem, there is really no point in watching this.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading.",

Well The story itself is not so new and just a common teenager story. The MC is Kazuma, one day he and his (cute?) little brother, ayumu, moved to a small town and meet various girls there. The plot is ordinary but interesting. I laughed a lot when i watched this anime. But for viewers that seek the harem anime, i think this isn't a harem anime.\r\nWell, this anime rise in the art. After all, this is 2011anime isn't it? The character, animation and background is very beautiful. Two things that catch my eyes in the entire anime is that the cute girls and beautiful BG. You will attached to this anime art, i swear.\\n\\n\r\nThe music in this anime is okay. The OP was good but, i don't think with the ED. You can hear cheerful song and beautiful song from this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe Character. I don't think the character is a good thing in this anime. They just stay like the beginning to the end of this anime. Not a single character development (maybe sakai hina's father?).\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that have been entertaining to me is cute girls and beautiful BG. The story is fine but its just too ordinary. Love story? A little boring. you know that she love MC for the first time they meet each other. And their relationship isn't progressing at all in the anime except just for the last episode. A rushed conclusion. So i recommend it to you if you like an ordinary love story and a cute girls. This anime will entertain you.",

            "content": "I decided to watch this in my time deciding what major anime I should watch next.\r\nThe story revolves around male lead Kazuma Hoshino and is pretty much your usual slice-of-life romance although there are its little differences here and there. For one, the cast are in a small town rather than a large city bustling with all sorts of things to do. Rather, their town is quiet and very open with forests and other nature-like things.\r\nStory:\r\n Kazuma Hoshino and his little brother Ayumu Hoshino are moving to a small country town to settle in before their parents do. However, as shown in the beginning, thisis not Kazuma's first time in this town. He went there for a day as a child and befriended a purple haired girl and promised they would always be friends. \\n\\n\r\nSince they're from a large city it causes many rumors to spread around amongst the people, mainly all the females. His accidental kiss with Ui in the first episode doesn't help with the rumors much either. Kazuma later befriends the cast and enjoy activities with them. It's a very basic slice-of-life romance and the you will see that it will revolve around the same scene time and time again.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, because it is only 12 episodes it suffers from the lack of character development time. I found myself disappointed at how they rushed the ending and hoped they had more episodes. I felt that the ending was very forced due to the lack of relationship development as well which really brings the score of the story down.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe art is excellent. The characters are very easy on the eyes, have fluid motion and the scenery details are beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending are very catchy and although I didn't fall in love with them at first like I do with most openings and endings, I grew to like them. I didn't really notice the background music but I didn't find any tracks annoying. Overall the sound was pretty decent but nothing special.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are very one-sided. Once you see their personality that's all you will get. Ui loves food, Ibuki is protective and doesn't like perverts, Hina obsesses over cute things and Tsumugi acts as the motherly figure. There's nothing particularly memorable of any of these characters and it becomes a little boring how many times they rinse and reuse the same jokes or events. As mentioned before, there is hardly any time for character or relationship development so what you see is what you get.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest the only reason why I kept watching was to kill time. It's not a bad anime, but it's not that great of one either. I mildly enjoyed it but I can't be sure everyone else will. There's not much of an incentive to keep watching other than the very small plot device they implemented in the first episode which I will not go into too much detail of.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nYes, overall... it was below average. The entire time I found myself ranting in my head about nearly everything. The forced ending just fueled the fire and it's a shame things turned out they did in my opinion. If you see the ending you may feel the same disappointment I feel. This anime felt like an RPG where right from the start everything is unlocked. There's nothing really fun in that, now is there?  I'd only recommend this anime if you're looking for a quick sol romance harem. If you decide to watch it, don't expect much.",

            "content": "Story: Hoshizora e Kakaru Hashi, or  A Bridge to the Starry Skies, is another harem story about Kazuma Hoshino moving out to the countryside because his younger brother Ayumu has a certain health problem. Now upon arrival they sort of get lost and Kazuma somehow accidentally kiss Ui when he slips and fell on her. Kind of the typical harem thing anyways, and his life in the small town of Yambiko soon starts as he makes friends and help out the other girls. Another typical thing in a harem genre anime. However the story does have a sort of romance to it and witha tad bit of comedy. Though the plot is almost not there again, but it does have it sweet moments and funny moments.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The character design again really similar to many harem genre where the girls are cute and the guy is like dense. There is however a lot of scenery because the setting is in the countryside so you can expect scenes of beautiful sunsets, star filled skies, clear rivers, etc.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound track is really suited for the anime. The character voices are pretty well suited for each character though some were not so well suited.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Since this anime is another harem genre type, the male protagonist is of course dense, though they do tweak the genre up a bit by adding a younger brother figure. This makes Kazuma seems like an even more caring person because he constantly cares about his younger brother due to his bad health. The other characters in the harem are like the generic ones, like the childhood friend, the female protagonist's best friend, the cool girl, the caring and sweet senpai, etc. So the character variation is not that creative.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Overall I thought it was a pretty good anime. It was like a short romance/comedy type in my opinion and I thought that it was pretty cute how Kazuma really wanted to take care of his younger brother. Though it was really short and you might feel that it went by pretty quick. There were some funny parts and some cute parts, however it does create the feeling that the anime was kind of slow. So if you are looking for a serious romance anime this is not for you. It is mainly a short funny and sweet story about a city boy slowly falling in love with a countryside girl and making new friends in his new hometown. Well hope you enjoy! \\n",

The anime centers around 2 brothers, moving from the city to the country side due to the poor health of the younger sibling. \r\nThe anime is a cliche of romance and harems, as this is an adaptation from a game, therefore should be expected. Even with this, the anime does well, as the beautiful visuals is very appealing and quite outstanding in any standard of anime. The characters are different and varied enough that the heroines don't seem dull, therefore bodes well for a romance anime. I musthowever say, that as expected from a game adaption, it isnt the greatest or the most outstanding romance anime, however it does well as a harem, and EXTREMELY well as an adaptation, compared to other game-to-anime adaptations.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all this anime is worth a watch if you like romance and comedy, it is quite cliched in many parts, however it works well with this. If you really like this anime, i recommend you try the game, as the stories of the other heroines are quite interesting.",

            "content": "Hoshizora e Kakaru Hashi is another harem romance. Thankfully recently the genre has evolved with the use of omnibus format, and a higher frequency of couples. Of course, these are some general things that have made the genre more bearable and enjoyable. Unfortunately, there is nothing that makes Hoshizora stick out among the dozens of harems, but overall not a horrible watch.\r\nOur lead Kazuma is pretty standard. He returns the countryside after a long time due to his sickly little brother. Kazuma is not horribly dense which is a relief, but he doesn't have any redeeming qualities other than the typical kindness towards others. Asusual it is up to other parts to pick up the slack. Thankfully the story is well done, incorporating three town events. The rest are everyday stuff which leaves it up to the characters to make it interesting.\\n\\n\r\nNakatsugawa Ui is even worst than Kazuma. Of course, the show starts off with a accidental falling kiss and you have two reactions. One is that it is incredibly clich\u00e9 and stupid, but two you are horrified that she is going to be one of the main girls. While at least Kazuma is strong and kind, Ui acts like a five year old, treating Kazuma as a onii-chan, and all of her scenes consist of her being hungry or eating.\\n\\n\r\nA bit better we have Madoka who is androphobic. She the local shrine maiden and does make you want to root for her as she actually tries to get Kazuma's attention. There is also the senpai Hina whom for some reason is horrible at communicating. While there are a few stupid moments her arc is rather funny and enjoyable. Finally we have Ibuki whom is Ui's best friend and an archer. A bit tsundere at first personally I found her the smartest and most worthy in the entire show.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy isn't half bad in Hoshizora, and when the focus was on others like Koyori, self proclaimed ninja, it improved my impression of the show greatly. His little brother gets as much fanservice time as any of the girls as he is 'so cute' that he even cross dresses for us.\\n\\n\r\nHoshizora will stay in my mind as an enjoyable show. As I write this review I can't help but realize that it was rather average, and it was rather disappointing in the end. There are better harems out there so I don't think I would recommend it unless you are looking for 'just another.'\\n\\n\\n\r\nQuestions and input on my review is welcome and accepted!",

And the preparation ofits setting is also not at all bad. The traditions of the fictional city of Yamabiko enough to be seasonings that will make fans of the romantic story touched. However, this anime is still unable to extricate themselves from having to peel the lives of the other girls, so this anime is full of events that do not need such help resolve an argument with agirl his father or to help a girlcheer a sickchild. There will probably be argued that even in small portions, these events are still part of the story, little by little become a stepping stone to eventually Kazuma and the girl chosen to unite, but if it is true, then the problem of this anime, however, lies in his storytelling that runs too slow and sometimes very boring.",

            "content": "Your typical run-of-the-mill school harem animes, where more focus is put into fan service, character design and suggestive jokes rather than actual storyline or character development. But then again this one does have some nice animation and an attractive cast. Again, nothing special but still worth a watch if you just want to take a break from some of the srsbusiness animes out there. \r\nStoryline is pretty your textbook harem plot; guy has visted/lived in the town in the past, returns for some reason but manages to leave behind any memories of previous encounters he may have had. He bumps into a girl and latermeets them in the school he has newly transferred to. From there he meets more and more girls and a pile of fanservice and suggestive jokes later, the end. Of course, he does make one male friend who is loud, funny and perverted who tries so hard, but ultimately fails to bag himself a girl. Poor guy.\\n\\n\r\nAs usual, there's one character, namely Ui, who has a somewhat more meaningful troubled past where it is revealed to us that she was very attached to her brother, bordering on too close, and she still hadn't fully accepted that he was now happy and married with another woman. She fills this emotional void by getting closer to the protagonist, as he reminds her of her brother, and would get increasingly jealous when her best friend showed signs of getting closer to him. This had me praying in hope that the plot could thicken, maybe a bit of rivalry or even better, a bit of yandere action! (KaedeKaedeKaedeKaedeKaedeKaedeKaedeKaedeKaedeKaede - Shuffle!) But all this was in vain as apparently the girls may like him, but not enough to fight someone. Apparently these girls must have a 'Bros before Hoes' thing too. \\n\\n\r\nThe music was alright, nothing that stood out as being especially good or especially bad.\\n\\n\r\n***spoiler alert***\\n\r\nOne thing that hugely disappointed me more than anything though is how little significance the opening scene had. Its another typical flashback in the past where he meets a girl but has to say goodbye, which undoubtedly the main character will not remember till halfway through the series at least. And this is true in this case also, but within about 10minutes of remembering, he's already rejected her and is halfway back home. I was truly just speechless over this, I knew he wouldn't end up with her anyway from the blatantly obvious OP that most harem animes have but that was just a kick in the teeth really.\\n\r\nSome girls weren't even considered in the whole fray despite one girl seeing his manly parts in the first episode (clearly wasn't very impressive), one girl being carried like a princess in a wedding dress and another spending the night with him in the same futon. \\n\r\n***spoiler end***\\n\\n\r\nOne point that people may like or dislike about this anime is that it has a conclusive ending. None of the mystery of who the protagonist is going to end up with, whether you support his decision or not.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, if there's one point that could summarise this whole review is the word 'decent'. Nothing really made this anime stand out from the other countless harem anime out there, but it is worth a watch.",

If you are ever surprised at one of the \"arcs\" it must be because you just started watching anime.\r\n_It is enjoyable, in the exact same measure a bowl of corn flakes (or other plain cereal) is enjoyable. It's a product you know; you don't think about corn flakes, It does not fill you, nor does it provide any long term sustenance. It continues to exist for the sake of going through the motions inyour routine. \\n\\n\r\nAbout the characters: \\n\\n\r\n__At first the relationship of the siblings appears to open for oportunities to question the status quo, (Yes there is some hints to an incestous relationship between brothers.) But hoshizora quickly realizes this, and changes to a classic Harem anime. And so that no one feels challenged it comes complete with the mandatory beach, confession and shopping date scenes.\\n\\n\r\n_One thing to commend: At least the main character is not totaly oblivious and dense (thank Dog for the small miracles), at least he understands how his actions affect the other charachters. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound:\\n\r\n__Both in musical score and sound effects is nothing to write home about. The BMG tries to match the rural, mountain effect, ends up being dull and lackluster. \\n\r\nThe Seiyuu's selected for the show are mostly new voices (or at least voices with few known parts). Some have experience mainly as support characters.\\n\\n\r\n_Insert songs are enjoyable, but not something you will find yourself downloading (much less buying) soon. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nThis series might have been a big hit 10 years ago, now it barely blips. This series will be seen and quickly forgoten by everyone except those for whom this is their first harem.",

Protagonist not completely stupidly ignorant of all the girls' feelings which was good.  There's a shota bias, which I find annoying.  Watch it if you have nothing better to do, but there are better harem ones ifthat's your thing.  Art good, music meh, characters pfft.  Ending predictable.

            "content": "\"INCESTUOUS HOMOSEXUALS!\"\r\nT'Was my first impression on this anime but fortunately it has none of that.\r\nHoshizora e Kakaru Hashi or in English, A Bridge to the Starry Skies, or in the French, Un pont vers le ciel \u00e9toil\u00e9 (everything sound sexier in French) is based on a visual novel made by Feng whom I'm not familiar with any other works. (Known for making the visual novel Akane Iro, which was then adapted into an anime, that was a disaster) Having finished this galge using a lousy translator program that killed every emotional scene that the eroge had to offer (Yes, you know I'm talking about youATLAS and AGTH!) I've decided to watch the anime to displace that horrible, horrible visual novel translations with better subs.\\n\\n\r\nSo if you're a hardcore follower of \"Way of the Harem\" you should know by now that every typical Harem lead must somehow \"dispose\" of his parents. This statement stands true for Hoshino Kazuma, our Harem lead. But unlike other harem animes, his parents absence is actually feasible. They're not on a world tour or fighting aliens or working overseas... Kazuma and his younger brother were sent to the countryside because of his younger brother's health condition and it was mention in the anime that his parents \"will join them eventually..\" Sounds plausible.\\n\\n\r\nIn this new town, he met a girl, fell on top of a girl, kissed a girl, called a pervert, caught naked, got teased for a small d*ck  and the list goes on. A cliche harem story you say? NOT SO FAST! (Feng apparently have a fetish for accidental kiss. Nothing wrong about it. That's as close as you can get to non-jail-able sexual harassment) \\n\\n\r\nI've decided not to review this anime based on the visual novel. In defense of harem animes being critized by it's cliche-ness and never ending quest to satisfy our \"fan-service\" needs, I shall judge a harem anime as a class of it's own, not to be compared with other types of genres. Thus I present to you, \"The Harem Deviation Calculator\"\\n\\n\r\nUsing the following formula\\n\r\nH= 3/(n-2) x (N!/n) x (Y)^1/2 - TK\u03c1\\n\\n\r\nWhere..\\n\r\nH represents the Harem Score\\n\r\nn represents the number of girls in the harem\\n\r\nN represents the number of different type of girls\\n\r\nY represents the dependency of the male harem lead\\n\r\nK represents the magnitude of \u201ccockblockers\u201d\\n\r\n\u03a1 represents the dense-ness of the male harem lead\\n\r\nT represents the cohesion of the fellow female members\\n\\n\r\nLet's begin shall we?\\n\\n\r\nNumber of girls in the harem:\\n\r\nA total of six main girls and two subs. And one little brother.\\n\\n\r\nTypes of girls: [This will be a simplified version]\\n\\n\r\nNakatsugawa Ui\\n\r\nAirhead[\u2713], Big Appetite[\u2713], Older brother complexity[\u2713], First Kiss[\u2713] \\n\r\nFirst Girl Rule[\u2713] \\n\\n\r\nHinata Ibuki\\n\r\nArcher girl[\u2713], Possessive[\u2713], Anti-Pervert[\u2713], Tsundere[\u2713]\\n\\n\r\nKoumoto Madoka\\n\r\nMiko[\u2713], Androphobic[\u2713], Shy[\u2713], Childhood friend[\u2713], BOING![\u2713] \\n\r\nFriendzoned[\u2713] \\n\\n\r\nSakai Hina\\n\r\nYuri-able[\u2713], Elegent[\u2713], Soft toy fetish[\u2713], Enjoys talking to in-animated objects[\u2713], self-conscious[\u2713] \\n\\n\r\nToudou Tsumugi\\n\r\nOlder Sister[\u2713], School Idol[\u2713], Clumsy[\u2713] , hard working[\u2713] \\n\\n\r\nToudou Koyori\\n\r\nStrong will[\u2713], energetic[\u2713], kind[\u2713], tomboy[\u2713], Innocent[\u2713]\\n\\n\r\nHoshino Ayumu\\n\r\nWait hold it... Oh thank god. I almost mistaken his younger brother into his harem.. \\n\r\nWell as you can see the characters are greatly varied however I am shocked that a glasses girl isn't present. It's a great loss for glasses fan everywhere...\\n\\n\r\nDependency:\\n\r\nWell Kazuma is reliable enough to take care of his younger brother, thus gives him a significant amount of credit for this. Although he does not have any super power or super human abilities, he is athletic so I guess that counts in a way towards his dependency score.\\n\\n\r\nCockblockers: Low\\n\r\nYorozu Senka, the lady in charge of the inn where the Hoshi brothers are staying. Probably the first non-blood relative to have saw Kazuma's other little brother (You know what I'm talking about) Although she supports Kazuma having healthy relationships with other girls, her positive attitude might just instill more awkwardness between the Kazuma and his \"choosen\" girl. Other than that, he does not have a younger sister which would mean less \"caught in the act\" events. (Though I rarely see a younger brother in harem genre before)\\n\\n\r\nDense-ness: Moderate\\n\r\nModerately dense. He is aware of some of the girls' feelings for him. (But not all of them)\\n\\n\r\nCohesion: High\\n\r\nAll the girls are on friendly terms with each other. Well yeah, this is quite common in a harem. But the plus point is that if one of them got into a relationship with the main harem lead, I can assure you, yanderes won't be present. (Which means no severed heads and boat rides) nor would he have to cut ties with any of them.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall, what is the verdict?\\n\r\n[HAREM EXPECTATION INDEX METER]\\n\r\n-HOSHINO KAZUMA- HAPPY HAPPY FUN TIME\\n\r\nPositive but still a cliched harem (low deviation score)\\n\\n\r\nSo there you have it. Fairly nothing exceptionally interesting ever happened in the anime. Art and sound wise is just slightly above the average line. Characters do not really have a noticeable impact on the audience. There's also a lacking amount of fan-service thus reducing the enjoyment score for those who actually was hoping for it. But if you find yourself wanting to contribute to the research of harem genres, then go ahead and watch this.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading,\\n\r\nHaremu Kingu,\\n\r\nSigning off!",

            "content": "Hoshizora e Kakaru Hashi is an anime based off the visual novel of the same name. I haven't played that visual novel, more specifically I don't play visual novels at all, so I cannot comment on the coherence of the adaptation. Instead, I am going to analyze and critique this anime as a standalone work.\r\nHoshizora e Kakaru Hashi tells the story of two brothers who are in the process of moving homes. As they're looking for a place to stay, the older brother (Kazuma) gets lost in a forest. He meets a girl, and of course, he ends up \"accidentally\" kissing her. This is thebeginning of the girl, Ui, and Kazuma's romantic relationship. They also happen to go to the same school; good lord, the coincidences. And that's about it. The entire story is about how Ui and Kazuma will manage to confess their love for each other; exactly why I give the story a \"5\". Not surprising, though, as this is a visual novel adaptation after all.\\n\\n\r\nThis isn't to say that the story is completely smooth as I made it out to be; there are a few edges in this anime's romance, it isn't just a straight line. In the end, you could see where the story was going, and the characters were fairly easy to read. To be honest, Hoshizora could've been something great if it weren't so linear. It has beautiful art, an amazing opening, and a likeable set of characters. It's just a shame that its story is so bland; don't expect too much when you're watching this anime. There is also never any sort of major conflict. Despite that, it is still a refreshing anime that you can unwind and relax while watching. Hoshizora e Kakaru Hashi is not a bad anime in the slightest, and there are some bright moments within it. Overall, an enjoyable watch that is unfortunately shallow.",

And he accidentaly kisses Ui and Ibuki saw them and so Kazuma's new life begins in the school where he transferred and make matters worse Ibuki and Ui is his classmate .\r\nArt: 9\r\nArt. Some people don't love the design of the arts in other anime but Hoshizora e Kakaru Hashi is one of the bestart i have ever seen the background is nice it's well detailed and because it's a small town there's not much building you will see in this anime.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nReally love the sound. Sound effects is nice. The opening song is one of my favorites really nice. Also the voice in each character for me fits really well for them. Each voice for each character make me think that somewhat it's their natural voice it really fits them well.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nThe design on the characters is really unique. All i can say about them is their really cute. You'll really fall for them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoymant: 10 \\n\r\nYes, I enjoy watching this anime the story keeps getting better as more episode are release, more lovey-dovey are unravelling, more flashback are surfacing. So yeah you'll enjoy it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nYes i give it a 9 because the design on the characters are unique. The sound is nice. The anime is well detailed. The story keeps getting better as more episode are release. more romantic moments so it's really enjoyable.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis is my first review that i have ever written so i'm sorry if there is some mistake that i have written really sorry and i'll try to be more better as i write more reviews.

(and more down to Earth - not that the angel/demon thing bugged me too much).\r\nThe first episode was astounding, the art was the first thing I noticed and let's be honest, it desevers a 10.\r\nMore importantly, the art is similar to Studio Key so my hopes increased tenfold\r\n(Think Kanon2006, Clannad, Air...See what I did there?)\\n\\n\r\nHigh hopes heh?\\n\\n\r\nWell let me tell you that my sweet little dream about a more realistic and mature Shuffle! was crushed to smithereens and thrown into the deepest pit of Tartarus.\\n\\n\r\nNo plot, no character development, not a seinen (FAR from being a seinen), no nothing except free fan service. If you're denying this fact, you're just lying to yourself. \\n\\n\r\nI honestly gave it a 3 just because of the art, otherwise this show can be labeled as an epic failure or a big pile of rotten shit.\\n\r\nAm I mad? Oh yeah I'm mad, wasting a potentially kick ass anime just for this? Definitely the worst let down I ever experienced.\\n",

            "content": "\"Dont judge anime if you havent watching all the episode\" LESSON LEARNED~\r\nWhy would i say that? First, like the other reviewer said, the first impression that you will get was \"Incestous Homosexual\" but praise to the lord and the creator of this anime, the anime wasnt about that.\r\nHoshizora e Kakaru Hashi or A Bridge to the Starry Skies (kinda weird name) is like your usual generic harem anime which we have a bunch of cute girls and one boy that being liked by many girls. what means \"like your usual generic harem anime\"? USUALLY or we can said ALWAYS, harem anime didnt have any romanticending or get laid (based on all harem anime that i have watched). and not just that, USUALLY my perspective about harem anime was :\\n\r\n- Have a little sister that have brother complex\\n\r\n- Being liked by ALL of the girls in anime itself (sometimes they liked without any logical reasons)\\n\r\n- Surrounded by beautiful girls\\n\r\n- The girls usually have their own uniqueness (tsundere, dandere, and kuudere) (if you're looking for yandere, then it wouldnt be a harem anime, it would be a horror  anime) LOL\\n\r\n- The MC usually at the end didnt get laid or girlfriends (For all the harem lover will know what i mean)\\n\\n\r\nAnd why i am saying all that meaningless words? FYI, HoKaHa (since the title is so long) is really crossing my perspective about harem anime. its something unique yet its not so amazing too. Why? for the first i have a problem with the story itself, while watching this anime episode after episode, many question clinging into my mind \"What is the actual story/main story?\"  \"Did this anime focus on the LUCKY BASTARD kiss incident or about the MC's little brother sick?\" and until the last episode i still dont get what this story about, what i know is the last episode is really surprise me. A LOT.\\n\\n\r\n\"Oh so this anime didnt have any main plot, so whats so good about this anime since you rated it 7?\"\\n\r\nCalm down, yeah it doesnt have any strong plot or main plot, and just what we know is when we're watching this anime was the MC moving to that village because of  the little brother (he is have some MYSTERIOUS disease that until now i dont know what disease that he have) and then he got a kiss incident with a stranger girl. Ok you can imagine that.... i give you a time for imagining it.\\n\\n\r\nDone? lets process to the reason why i think this anime was good, for the first HoKaHa really suprise me in many ways, it crossess all of my expectation about what harem anime was (see all the list that what my perspective about harem anime in beginning of this review). then HoKaHa was surprising and sometimes it have a touchy and some moments that will make us smile or maybe jiggle a bit. i must say it was amusing and really worth of my 300 Minutes or 5 hours (12 episode x 25 minutes).\\n\\n\r\nAfter we talk about the story, lets talk about the other aspects, Art. I can't say to much about this one, but for sure, the quality of art in this anime was so amazing, On the first episode we can see a beautiful drawing in the forest, amazing scenery and even the water flows was like the real one. Well, its not the best, but atleast it will not make your eyes bored.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the sound section, well it was so - so. since i dont find any amazing sound that happen in this anime, from the OP, the ED or in the voice actors it was like any other harem anime, it was not really good and it wasnt really bad either, so we can said \"normal\". LOL\\n\\n\r\nAnd for the closing, i must said it was very amusing harem anime, what else do you need?\\n\r\n- Harem,check ; romance, check; comedy, check; dere girls, check; GET LAID; check!\\n\\n\r\nif you're looking for an unusual harem anime, this maybe the right anime for you, cheers!",

            "content": "*Falling over the girl* *looks in her eyes almost mouth close*\r\n                 -Romantic Scene-\r\nFor me its the first time the guy falls over the girl and kisses her (accidently). And I've seen many Romance Series..\r\nIt's another romance with some Comedy. I'm starting to see less and less unique ones.\r\nKEEP IN MIND Only 2 episodes have been released which this review is based on.\r\n(For a quicker review, check Overall)\r\nStory: 7\r\nHe accidentally trips and falls over her and gives her a good sweet accidental kiss while Ui's best friend Hinata sees this.HENTAI!\\n\\n\r\nComment: This was not very original at all, but the story gets more interesting. And many might thinks prob \"Ui is gonna be the love of his life in the end, BOORING\" but no, as you watch, he meets a lot of girls that gives impressions and you are never sure, trust me.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not bad. I'm always interested in seeing if the Writer will end it with the first most obvious (the kiss), or totally blow my mind when perhaps a guy get feelings for the one you did not expect.\\n\r\nAnd I love the conflicts and the humor from these.\\n\r\nIt does not have Comedy added to the Genre in Info, but there is full of Comedy in here.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThis art is similar to Clannad, or Kanon 2006. Bigger eyes and huge hair.\\n\r\nIt's nicely done with many colours. I think the school suits are pretty cute and nicely formed. And the characters look good and matches personality with the art.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nI mean wow. This Opening theme sounds better then most i've heard. Love the flute. Its not totally original but its a lot better then some series out there that sound exactly the same.\\n\r\nThe voices on girls are OFC typical high pitch. Witch I have nothing against, i think its cute if its just not overused. Which this series doesnt :) Thumbs Up.\\n\r\nWhats funny is Ayumu has the same voice and is supposed to be an onormally cute little brother that does not seem to be Kazumas brother at all.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nEven tho you might have seen this type of Romance Comedy Harem before, it's actually hard to compare it. All the characters have unique sides which surprises me because it wasn't expected.\\n\r\nI like the little super cute brother thing he got going on, and Hinata is one special girl being best friends with Ui.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI enjoy it a lot. I'm very interested in Romance Comedies and have seen a lot.\\n\r\nSo far, the beginning was just great with the kiss. It usally stopps before he reaches all the way. But not here! It WANTS you to keep watching and you prob will at least for a while since cmon, something more gotta happan! Is what you would think..\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7 or 8\\n\r\n7 or 8, depending on how it continues. \\n\r\nI'm enjoying it and this series is good. It's short and prob wont have a sequal. So it's just one more nice little series to be watching.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like Romance, Harem, Comedy with added Romance, you will love this.\\n\r\nIf you have High Anime Compatibility with me you will probably like this.\\n\\n\r\n*The story is typical for RomCom but surprisingly have unique sides. (Story does have comedy)\\n\r\n*The art is very well done and gives a feeling of Clannad or Kanon 2006.\\n\r\n*The Opening was surprisingly better and more original then most ones. Cute and fitting voices.\\n\r\n*Characters have personal and unique sides. If you have seen RomHarem before you prob will not like it as much. But give it a shot.\\n\r\n*I enjoyed it. This is one of the more compelling ones.\\n\\n\\n",

I just had a fun time watching it, and it'll be my Summer Anime to watch along with Air, so don't think that I'm overrating things, because I really loved this anime.\r\nStory: 8\r\nStory of boy meets girl, so pretty normal, but the entire anime is full of comedy, romance, you know, normal stuff for harem animes. But I was amazingly satisfied with the ending, so watch it, you'll know what I mean.\r\nArt: 10\r\nI loved the art, in fact, this anime had the best artwork I've ever seen in ananime. I love the design of the characters, but their eyes were beautifully drawn, multicolored, which was more realistic, and prettier to look at, and then the scenery was realistic too, the streams and trees looked real.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\\n\r\nI love the cast, because they act out the characters so well, and then there's the music, which I'm a huge fan of, especially \"Mighty Girl Power de\" and \"Horoscope Nomico\". Both really good songs.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\\n\r\nThere are almost always characters in animes that I can't stand, such as Renge from \"Ouran HighSchool Host Club\", but this anime had no characters that I wanted to beat up. I loved every single character, and I'm a huge fan of Ui and Ibuki. The characters are all fun to watch in action, and I love their personalities.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nEasy 10. I didn't hate any of the episodes at all, and I've rewatched the series numerous times. It never gets old.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe story could have been the slightest bit better, and that's pretty much the only reason it doesn't get a 10 from me. Don't get me wrong, this anime is in my top 10. I recommend it for almost all people who liked Negima!?, Maburaho, Nagasarete Airantou, etc.",

            "content": "This is a really cute romance show that I will probably want to re-watch again in a year or two (that way I forget the details).\r\nThe story evolves around a boy named Kazuma who once visited this small town and now, 10 years later, has to live there, but the only memories he has of this small town was his short time that was spent playing with a girl. On his arrival to the town, his little brothers hat gets stolen by a forest monkey and Kazuma then chases it far into the forest. Finally, getting the hat he stumbles upon a girl name Ui,who was out gathering vegetables in the forest. On the way back to the bus station, they had to cross a small stream and the only way across is to hop on some stones, but when Kazuma tried to cross the stream, he slips and lands on top of Ui effectively stealing her first kiss.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's how it all starts.\\n\r\nAt first, I thought it was kind of lame, but I guess the beginning could've been worse.\\n\\n\r\nStory ~6/10~\\n\r\nOverall, the story isn't unique, but it has it's good points to it. A boy going around proving his worth to several girls in his school and to turn around and not realize any of their feelings... sounds quite familiar.\\n\r\nBut I still cried like a baby and laughed occasionally.\\n\\n\r\nArt~7/10~\\n\r\nThe art isn't something worth jumping off a cliff for, it has flaws here and there, but overall I would give it 7/10. The backgrounds were well drawn and I didn't get blurry vision (like I do watching some animes), so that's a plus. I guess the art is like the music, easily forgettable. The art has its own tone and gets the story across quite well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter ~5/10~\\n\r\nThis is where the originality completely disappears. The characters you'll see in this anime are the same characters you've seen a million times. 2 stubborn athletic girls, one who is extremely shy, one who is shy because of her height and another shy girl who (happened to be the girl Kazuma met 10 years ago).\\n\r\nSo, the characters are either the two extremes, shy or in-your-face. If you can find some originality in that... I'll cook you dinner.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give this a 9/10. I enjoyed this show and I do recommend it. My review cannot simply tell you the experience I had watching this show. I just hope others find it as good as I did. The first episode might seem like a big disappointment because of how the story starts, but after that, the story doesn't seem so bad.\\n\\n\r\nIt's worth giving a shot.",

            "content": "Even though almost all harem anime are very similar (in terms of plot and characters), at least most of them have a little unique element to help separate themselves from others. This is not the case with Hoshizora e Kakaru Hashi, this anime is probably one of the most generic series out there. There is just nothing about this series that pops out.\r\nHoshizora e Kakaru Hashi starts out like most harems, the protagonist has just moved into a new town and then has the accidental kiss with the main heroine of the story. After getting introduced to all the characters, the protagonist gets one onone time with each girl and helps solve each of their problems. Finally, the main characters  realize their true feelings for each other and that's pretty much the whole series. This series is pretty cliche after cliche after cliche, nothing special ever happens (a problem that many harem series suffer from). Another problem is that the feelings that the main characters have for each other seem to come out of nowhere .The reason for this is that there is very little development between the two main characters because most of the time is spent on the other girls. At least the ending offers closure instead of leaving the ending up in the air. There really isn't anything else to say, everything about this anime has been used in many other harem series already. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are also very one dimensional and generic. The main hero of the series, Kazuma, is very kind and always helps others with their problems, and this turns into the quality that makes others fall for him, very much like many other protagonists in other harem series. A positive about the main character is that he is not extremely dense making him more likable. The main female in this anime, Ui, is actually the most unique character of the bunch because she has more traits than the rest of the cast, but that really isn't saying much. Her character is still very generic and not that interesting at all. Also some of her features may turn some people off.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters pretty much have the same personality as the characters in many other harems, give or take some minor features. They are all likeable in their own way but again nothing stands out.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound are fairly good, everything is certainly colorful and backgrounds are pretty nice. The sound is what you could expect from other harems, an upbeat and catchy opening and ending.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment all depends on the viewer, if you don't mind watching a harem then this would be another one to check off the list. It is still mildly enjoyable as long as you aren't looking for too much. \\n\\n\r\nHoshizora e Kakaru Hashi is the very definition of a generic harem series. Has nothing unique about it and if you have seen even one harem, there is really no point in watching this.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading.",

Well The story itself is not so new and just a common teenager story. The MC is Kazuma, one day he and his (cute?) little brother, ayumu, moved to a small town and meet various girls there. The plot is ordinary but interesting. I laughed a lot when i watched this anime. But for viewers that seek the harem anime, i think this isn't a harem anime.\r\nWell, this anime rise in the art. After all, this is 2011anime isn't it? The character, animation and background is very beautiful. Two things that catch my eyes in the entire anime is that the cute girls and beautiful BG. You will attached to this anime art, i swear.\\n\\n\r\nThe music in this anime is okay. The OP was good but, i don't think with the ED. You can hear cheerful song and beautiful song from this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe Character. I don't think the character is a good thing in this anime. They just stay like the beginning to the end of this anime. Not a single character development (maybe sakai hina's father?).\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that have been entertaining to me is cute girls and beautiful BG. The story is fine but its just too ordinary. Love story? A little boring. you know that she love MC for the first time they meet each other. And their relationship isn't progressing at all in the anime except just for the last episode. A rushed conclusion. So i recommend it to you if you like an ordinary love story and a cute girls. This anime will entertain you.",

            "content": "I decided to watch this in my time deciding what major anime I should watch next.\r\nThe story revolves around male lead Kazuma Hoshino and is pretty much your usual slice-of-life romance although there are its little differences here and there. For one, the cast are in a small town rather than a large city bustling with all sorts of things to do. Rather, their town is quiet and very open with forests and other nature-like things.\r\nStory:\r\n Kazuma Hoshino and his little brother Ayumu Hoshino are moving to a small country town to settle in before their parents do. However, as shown in the beginning, thisis not Kazuma's first time in this town. He went there for a day as a child and befriended a purple haired girl and promised they would always be friends. \\n\\n\r\nSince they're from a large city it causes many rumors to spread around amongst the people, mainly all the females. His accidental kiss with Ui in the first episode doesn't help with the rumors much either. Kazuma later befriends the cast and enjoy activities with them. It's a very basic slice-of-life romance and the you will see that it will revolve around the same scene time and time again.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, because it is only 12 episodes it suffers from the lack of character development time. I found myself disappointed at how they rushed the ending and hoped they had more episodes. I felt that the ending was very forced due to the lack of relationship development as well which really brings the score of the story down.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe art is excellent. The characters are very easy on the eyes, have fluid motion and the scenery details are beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending are very catchy and although I didn't fall in love with them at first like I do with most openings and endings, I grew to like them. I didn't really notice the background music but I didn't find any tracks annoying. Overall the sound was pretty decent but nothing special.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are very one-sided. Once you see their personality that's all you will get. Ui loves food, Ibuki is protective and doesn't like perverts, Hina obsesses over cute things and Tsumugi acts as the motherly figure. There's nothing particularly memorable of any of these characters and it becomes a little boring how many times they rinse and reuse the same jokes or events. As mentioned before, there is hardly any time for character or relationship development so what you see is what you get.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest the only reason why I kept watching was to kill time. It's not a bad anime, but it's not that great of one either. I mildly enjoyed it but I can't be sure everyone else will. There's not much of an incentive to keep watching other than the very small plot device they implemented in the first episode which I will not go into too much detail of.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nYes, overall... it was below average. The entire time I found myself ranting in my head about nearly everything. The forced ending just fueled the fire and it's a shame things turned out they did in my opinion. If you see the ending you may feel the same disappointment I feel. This anime felt like an RPG where right from the start everything is unlocked. There's nothing really fun in that, now is there?  I'd only recommend this anime if you're looking for a quick sol romance harem. If you decide to watch it, don't expect much.",

            "content": "Story: Hoshizora e Kakaru Hashi, or  A Bridge to the Starry Skies, is another harem story about Kazuma Hoshino moving out to the countryside because his younger brother Ayumu has a certain health problem. Now upon arrival they sort of get lost and Kazuma somehow accidentally kiss Ui when he slips and fell on her. Kind of the typical harem thing anyways, and his life in the small town of Yambiko soon starts as he makes friends and help out the other girls. Another typical thing in a harem genre anime. However the story does have a sort of romance to it and witha tad bit of comedy. Though the plot is almost not there again, but it does have it sweet moments and funny moments.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The character design again really similar to many harem genre where the girls are cute and the guy is like dense. There is however a lot of scenery because the setting is in the countryside so you can expect scenes of beautiful sunsets, star filled skies, clear rivers, etc.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound track is really suited for the anime. The character voices are pretty well suited for each character though some were not so well suited.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Since this anime is another harem genre type, the male protagonist is of course dense, though they do tweak the genre up a bit by adding a younger brother figure. This makes Kazuma seems like an even more caring person because he constantly cares about his younger brother due to his bad health. The other characters in the harem are like the generic ones, like the childhood friend, the female protagonist's best friend, the cool girl, the caring and sweet senpai, etc. So the character variation is not that creative.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Overall I thought it was a pretty good anime. It was like a short romance/comedy type in my opinion and I thought that it was pretty cute how Kazuma really wanted to take care of his younger brother. Though it was really short and you might feel that it went by pretty quick. There were some funny parts and some cute parts, however it does create the feeling that the anime was kind of slow. So if you are looking for a serious romance anime this is not for you. It is mainly a short funny and sweet story about a city boy slowly falling in love with a countryside girl and making new friends in his new hometown. Well hope you enjoy! \\n",

The anime centers around 2 brothers, moving from the city to the country side due to the poor health of the younger sibling. \r\nThe anime is a cliche of romance and harems, as this is an adaptation from a game, therefore should be expected. Even with this, the anime does well, as the beautiful visuals is very appealing and quite outstanding in any standard of anime. The characters are different and varied enough that the heroines don't seem dull, therefore bodes well for a romance anime. I musthowever say, that as expected from a game adaption, it isnt the greatest or the most outstanding romance anime, however it does well as a harem, and EXTREMELY well as an adaptation, compared to other game-to-anime adaptations.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all this anime is worth a watch if you like romance and comedy, it is quite cliched in many parts, however it works well with this. If you really like this anime, i recommend you try the game, as the stories of the other heroines are quite interesting.",

            "content": "Hoshizora e Kakaru Hashi is another harem romance. Thankfully recently the genre has evolved with the use of omnibus format, and a higher frequency of couples. Of course, these are some general things that have made the genre more bearable and enjoyable. Unfortunately, there is nothing that makes Hoshizora stick out among the dozens of harems, but overall not a horrible watch.\r\nOur lead Kazuma is pretty standard. He returns the countryside after a long time due to his sickly little brother. Kazuma is not horribly dense which is a relief, but he doesn't have any redeeming qualities other than the typical kindness towards others. Asusual it is up to other parts to pick up the slack. Thankfully the story is well done, incorporating three town events. The rest are everyday stuff which leaves it up to the characters to make it interesting.\\n\\n\r\nNakatsugawa Ui is even worst than Kazuma. Of course, the show starts off with a accidental falling kiss and you have two reactions. One is that it is incredibly clich\u00e9 and stupid, but two you are horrified that she is going to be one of the main girls. While at least Kazuma is strong and kind, Ui acts like a five year old, treating Kazuma as a onii-chan, and all of her scenes consist of her being hungry or eating.\\n\\n\r\nA bit better we have Madoka who is androphobic. She the local shrine maiden and does make you want to root for her as she actually tries to get Kazuma's attention. There is also the senpai Hina whom for some reason is horrible at communicating. While there are a few stupid moments her arc is rather funny and enjoyable. Finally we have Ibuki whom is Ui's best friend and an archer. A bit tsundere at first personally I found her the smartest and most worthy in the entire show.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy isn't half bad in Hoshizora, and when the focus was on others like Koyori, self proclaimed ninja, it improved my impression of the show greatly. His little brother gets as much fanservice time as any of the girls as he is 'so cute' that he even cross dresses for us.\\n\\n\r\nHoshizora will stay in my mind as an enjoyable show. As I write this review I can't help but realize that it was rather average, and it was rather disappointing in the end. There are better harems out there so I don't think I would recommend it unless you are looking for 'just another.'\\n\\n\\n\r\nQuestions and input on my review is welcome and accepted!",

And the preparation ofits setting is also not at all bad. The traditions of the fictional city of Yamabiko enough to be seasonings that will make fans of the romantic story touched. However, this anime is still unable to extricate themselves from having to peel the lives of the other girls, so this anime is full of events that do not need such help resolve an argument with agirl his father or to help a girlcheer a sickchild. There will probably be argued that even in small portions, these events are still part of the story, little by little become a stepping stone to eventually Kazuma and the girl chosen to unite, but if it is true, then the problem of this anime, however, lies in his storytelling that runs too slow and sometimes very boring.",

            "content": "Your typical run-of-the-mill school harem animes, where more focus is put into fan service, character design and suggestive jokes rather than actual storyline or character development. But then again this one does have some nice animation and an attractive cast. Again, nothing special but still worth a watch if you just want to take a break from some of the srsbusiness animes out there. \r\nStoryline is pretty your textbook harem plot; guy has visted/lived in the town in the past, returns for some reason but manages to leave behind any memories of previous encounters he may have had. He bumps into a girl and latermeets them in the school he has newly transferred to. From there he meets more and more girls and a pile of fanservice and suggestive jokes later, the end. Of course, he does make one male friend who is loud, funny and perverted who tries so hard, but ultimately fails to bag himself a girl. Poor guy.\\n\\n\r\nAs usual, there's one character, namely Ui, who has a somewhat more meaningful troubled past where it is revealed to us that she was very attached to her brother, bordering on too close, and she still hadn't fully accepted that he was now happy and married with another woman. She fills this emotional void by getting closer to the protagonist, as he reminds her of her brother, and would get increasingly jealous when her best friend showed signs of getting closer to him. This had me praying in hope that the plot could thicken, maybe a bit of rivalry or even better, a bit of yandere action! (KaedeKaedeKaedeKaedeKaedeKaedeKaedeKaedeKaedeKaede - Shuffle!) But all this was in vain as apparently the girls may like him, but not enough to fight someone. Apparently these girls must have a 'Bros before Hoes' thing too. \\n\\n\r\nThe music was alright, nothing that stood out as being especially good or especially bad.\\n\\n\r\n***spoiler alert***\\n\r\nOne thing that hugely disappointed me more than anything though is how little significance the opening scene had. Its another typical flashback in the past where he meets a girl but has to say goodbye, which undoubtedly the main character will not remember till halfway through the series at least. And this is true in this case also, but within about 10minutes of remembering, he's already rejected her and is halfway back home. I was truly just speechless over this, I knew he wouldn't end up with her anyway from the blatantly obvious OP that most harem animes have but that was just a kick in the teeth really.\\n\r\nSome girls weren't even considered in the whole fray despite one girl seeing his manly parts in the first episode (clearly wasn't very impressive), one girl being carried like a princess in a wedding dress and another spending the night with him in the same futon. \\n\r\n***spoiler end***\\n\\n\r\nOne point that people may like or dislike about this anime is that it has a conclusive ending. None of the mystery of who the protagonist is going to end up with, whether you support his decision or not.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, if there's one point that could summarise this whole review is the word 'decent'. Nothing really made this anime stand out from the other countless harem anime out there, but it is worth a watch.",

If you are ever surprised at one of the \"arcs\" it must be because you just started watching anime.\r\n_It is enjoyable, in the exact same measure a bowl of corn flakes (or other plain cereal) is enjoyable. It's a product you know; you don't think about corn flakes, It does not fill you, nor does it provide any long term sustenance. It continues to exist for the sake of going through the motions inyour routine. \\n\\n\r\nAbout the characters: \\n\\n\r\n__At first the relationship of the siblings appears to open for oportunities to question the status quo, (Yes there is some hints to an incestous relationship between brothers.) But hoshizora quickly realizes this, and changes to a classic Harem anime. And so that no one feels challenged it comes complete with the mandatory beach, confession and shopping date scenes.\\n\\n\r\n_One thing to commend: At least the main character is not totaly oblivious and dense (thank Dog for the small miracles), at least he understands how his actions affect the other charachters. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound:\\n\r\n__Both in musical score and sound effects is nothing to write home about. The BMG tries to match the rural, mountain effect, ends up being dull and lackluster. \\n\r\nThe Seiyuu's selected for the show are mostly new voices (or at least voices with few known parts). Some have experience mainly as support characters.\\n\\n\r\n_Insert songs are enjoyable, but not something you will find yourself downloading (much less buying) soon. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nThis series might have been a big hit 10 years ago, now it barely blips. This series will be seen and quickly forgoten by everyone except those for whom this is their first harem.",

Don't know why this is tagged as seinen as, baring some nudity in episode 6, it was a very basic, somewhat childish story.  Nothing that's not been seen and done better before.  Protagonist not completely stupidly ignorant of all the girls' feelings which was good.  There's a shota bias, which I find annoying.  Watch it if you have nothing better to do, but there are better harem ones ifthat's your thing.  Art good, music meh, characters pfft.  Ending predictable.  Really, you'll probably be bored.  \\n\\n\r\nDone. 5/10",

            "content": "Hoshizora e Kakaru Hashi is an enigma in my book. Normally, I do not like ecchi, harem fan service filled animes. Strangely enough, when I caught myself watching Hoshizora, I wondered, what the hell am I thinking? There's no way I'm going to like this.\r\nWell, I decided to watch the whole thing through and gave it a shot...and to my surprise, it turned out to be a better anime than I thought. Does it have an interesting story? No, not really. It has sort of a sweet, adorable story but nothing that hasn't been done before. So what was so great about this anime?\r\nHonestly, Ithought the comedy and writing was terrific. There were so many moments where I bust out laughing that I can't count on both my hands...and trust me, its hard to get a good laugh out of me from anime. The race/festival episode itself was to die for. I don't think I've laughed so hard through an entire anime episode in my life. I think what this anime pulled off well was yes, it had ecchi moments, but it seemed like those ecchi moments were balanced out well with slap stick comedy, not entirely used for the point of fan service.\\n\\n\r\nTo me, this anime was a lot like Angel Beats...not in plot or characters, but rather, it was an anime with lots of flaws, but I couldn't help but enjoy it regardless. This is a difficult anime to review or recommend because I believe how you'll enjoy this anime really depends on your style of comedy. If you enjoy a dark, intriguing plot, definitely not the anime for you. Although, if you like to get a few laughs out of life humor with sex jokes and innuendo, you'll love this anime. Granted, I'm not usually one to find that sort of thing funny but I somehow managed to find this anime funny.",

            "content": "Hoshizora is one of those few animes that I've watched but haven't reviewed straight away. Not necessarily because it was bad but because it was dull and nothing caught my interest. \r\nLike most men I enjoy watching harem animes because, even though I know a harem scenario would not happen to me in real life, I like to pretend that I'm the male lead in a harem anime. Virtually all straight men will tell you the same. One guy, dozens of girls, what more do you want? \r\nWell, I'll have to disappoint you because Hoshizora is not exacly a harem anime, despite the tag tellingus it is. Okey first then, the story - medicore at best. An extremely handsome guy called Kazuma with a brother who looks like his exact yet younger copy, decides to move into a small village. Once there a Japanese macaque grabs his brother's hat and runs off into the forest. Our heroic Kazuma runs after the monkey to retreive the hat. To our suprise he gets lost in the forest and doesn't know what to do. Miraciously, he happens to come across a good looking, pinked haired girl, around his age. Right. That's not all, read on. They start walking together and engage in a casual conversation, and then decide to cross a river(?). To cross it they have to jump on stones and the girl, predictably, makes it to the other side without a problem. The guy though, even though he's evidently stronger somehow manages to \"trip\" upon landing, pushes the girl over and... \"accidentaly\" kisses her. Apart from the fact that accidental kisses are cliche in anime, I've seen hudreds of them, the whole scene just seems so nauseatingly unbelievable, that you want to beat yourself on the head with a wrench until the memory of it goes away. \\n\\n\r\nAfter that little incident, or shall I just say - the next day, the male lead is introduced to the town and the dozens of good looking girls that inhabit it. I thought that this was the moment where the story was going to take off. I couldn't have been more wrong. Literally nothing happens. In most animes, we'd have some sort of development involving other girls and the male lead but for the larger part of this series, Kazuma is fixated on just one girl - the one he accidentaly kissed. I mean yeah some girls like him, some more than others but there's no harem feeling to it. There's no passion, like in Yosuga No Sora.  There's no drama, like in School Days. Girls don't fight over him, like in Nagasarete Airantou. The male lead is not forced to make any decisions whatsoever. It's just dull. I daresay even, that watching this anime is like watching the bold and the beautiful. Dull, boring... not interesting and it's going to be like that right to the very end.\\n\\n\r\nI really wanted to give this anime a way lower rating, 4 or 5 perhaps but one good thing about this anime is the art. It's extremely good. I also watched the 1080p version which was, breathtaking. Yes, the art is definitely something the studio worked on and to see movie-grade graphics in a TV series is rare. Also the sounds were very authentic and the voice acting was good and it was thanks to a combination of those two that I was able to endure the horrendous story to the end. \\n\\n\r\nWith all that in mind and wanting to be fair, I added 2 extra points to the score and that bumped it up a bit. Summing things up, if you're looking for a harem anime with a decent story I guarantee you that you're not going to find anything remotely interesting in here. This is more of a vanilla romantic story involving two characters only. However, if you enjoy good voice acting and brilliant graphics, well give it a shot.",

            "content": "This anime is exactly what it says on the tin, although based on a gal game it\u2019s surprisingly well behaved.\r\nThis show is one of those simple harem style anime, where you have that standard plot based around standard characters. Nothing exciting particularly happens but you do get that massive feel good sensation when the inevitable conclusion to the plot occurs. In regards to what\u2019s bad about this anime it\u2019s hard to say, because nothing really stands out, the whole anime is rather average so there aren't really any high expiations to start off with. It\u2019s the kind of thing you would watch whilst waiting forthe next episode of (in my immediate case) Shingeki no Kyojin to come out. It\u2019s a bit of fun, but it\u2019s nothing special.\\n\\n\r\nI suppose the main problem with this anime is the characters and plot, because everything else is actually quite good. The plot is that basic \u201cA handsome guy moves out the country side and suddenly Girls! Girls everywhere!\u201d I mean seeing as the anime is based on a gal game you can\u2019t really expect more, but I digress. Although the plot is basic and relatively boring you do find yourself getting attached to the characters somewhat. This is probably because the anime does a fantastic job of centering the large chunks of the episodes on the feelings of the girls involved. The same girls that happen to be going after the previously mentioned lucky b*****d that somehow managed to move in to \u201chot single girl central\u201d oh Japan we love you. Aside from this, however, the characterization is lacking a tad also. The girls presented are the usual line up of fetish, the quiet one, the strong one etc\u2026 The anime had been made well enough for it to want more but it has been bent rigidly around the harem, gal game, genre resulting in some of the characters coming across as forced. I\u2019m aware, by the way, that that\u2019s kind of what it\u2019s supposed to be but the anime, at points seems to want to be more than just a tacky standard harem anime, and it could have been.\\n\\n\r\nNow regardless of the fact that there is no way this anime could even be compared with the giants like Gurren Lagann, or Cowboy Bebop, in terms of my personal enjoyment, and to some affect production quality, it\u2019s done pretty good for itself. To this extent I mean the animation is actually pretty good, it\u2019s not Guilty Crown blow your face off good, but it\u2019s not bad. The music of the entire thing fits quite well too, so it makes you feel the right things at the right time. Overall I rather enjoyed this short little piece, it may be a standard one of a thousand anime that are all basically the same, but it\u2019s a bit of fun you know?\\n\\n\r\nOn a final note because of the spectacular averageness this anime has managed to achieve it\u2019s difficult to say much more about it, so I apologise for the short review. This anime is by no stretch of the imagination a really good anime, but neither is it really bad.\\n\\n\r\nPremise: 5/10\\n\r\nThe idea this anime is based around is incredibly mundane and has been done a thousand times before, but it manages to pull it off in its own way.\\n\\n\r\nPlot Development: 6/10\\n\r\nThe plot development is okay, but not brilliant. It\u2019s slow going and you only start to feel that the anime is progressing in the final few episodes. But those final few are very entertaining indeed.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 7/10\\n\r\nThe animation for this anime is surprisingly good considering its roots, however because of a lacking of any times where the animation could be put to the test there is no real proof of it\u2019s worth.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\r\nThe characters in this anime is one of its strong points because it manages to fit in the usual line up of boring harem figures and then puts a slightly different spin them and even explores their personality allowing you to become somewhat attached to them at times.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter Development: 6/10\\n\r\nThe character development in this anime is surprisingly good, because the anime manages to start off with the staple line up of characters in the beginning and end up with a group of characters you\u2019re emotionally attached to; having said that it\u2019s incredibly slow going and only seems to work on one character at a time.\\n\\n\r\nFluidity: 7/10\\n\r\nThis show flows quite well; there are no dodgy jumps in the story line, and you\u2019re never really left feeling like you\u2019ve missed something.  \\n\\n\r\nMusic: 8/10\\n\r\nThe music is very good but not very diverse. The correct thing always seems to be playing at the right time, setting the scene perfectly. But at times you feel like it\u2019s the same few tracks being played over and over again.\\n\\n\r\nIntro: 8/10\\n\r\nThe intro for this anime is fantastically done and it possibly one of the best features of this anime. Everything from the music to the animation seems to fit very well and puts you in the perfect mood for watching the episode.\\n\\n\r\nOutro: 6/10\\n\r\nThe outro is quite disappointing compared to the intro because nothing really happens; it\u2019s just a series of credits and pictures, having said that the music is upbeat and very nice to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: 7.5/10\\n\r\nI enjoyed watching this anime rather a lot, and the ending is quite nice. I only wish it was a bit longer and had a more in-depth story-line seeing as it has a lot of potential.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nTotal: 6.8/10 (Fine)\\n\\n\r\nStuart Macdonald\\n\\n\r\n(Note: This blog is not the main blog and origin of these posts, the main blog can be found at: http://theanimelistreview.blogspot.co.uk/)\\n",

            "content": "To me, this is about as close to a perfect comedy/harem anime as you can get.  It wasn't just a bunch of jumbled episodes dedicated solely to fan service, which I appreciate.  Fan service is nice and all, but there is a thing called too much fan service, and many harem animes are guilty of it.  Here, it's more, how should I put it... \"fitting\" \"tasteful\"?  You get the point.  Above that, there isn't some ambiguous ending.  That's right, a harem lead that actually picks a girl at the end!  He's not such an indecisive dunce as manyother harem protagonists.  Another thing I appreciated greatly was the fact that there was actually kissing in the show (and not just the first episode).  In many harem AND straight up romance anime, a confession happens and the characters are never even see touching, or are showed holding hands at the most.  It made it feel more real and gave more of an impact, especially with the beautiful art and scenery that comes along with the moment ;).  My only qualm was Madoka's backstory.  It's not a spoiler, because you learn it very early, but it seems like there was very little reason to have had Madoka and Kazuma meet when they were young.  It makes sense to have it in; it very much helped Madoka develop feelings for Kazuma, but with the show only being 12 episodes, it feels like they didn't get a chance to fully explore it.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed this show immensly and will definitely watch it again at some point.  Would recommend to fans of romance!",

            "content": "Hoshizora e Kakaru Hashi.  When I first started watching this anime I had very high hopes for it.  Up until episode 5 I was actually thinking that it may have been good enough to be in my top five.  But, as is usually the case with the harem genre, it fell flat of my expectations.  Now that i've got all of my complaining out of the way, I would like to focus on the good points of this anime, which despite my complaints, were quite abundant.\r\nStory:\r\nA typical harem genre story: Boy who lives without his parents moves to a new city,where a large group of attractive females fall in love with him.  However, Hoshizora e Kakaru Hashi goes a little beyond that.  The viewer is actually presented with a legitimate reason for Kazuma Hoshino (our protagonist) to have moved to his new home.  On his first day he meets Ui Nakatsugawa in a most unusual way, and this is when the story truly begins.  The story is not completely predictable, but you won't be utterly shocked by most of the events.  There wasn't as much \"romance\" as I usually prefer in an anime like this, but there was enough to keep me interested.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThis is where the anime truly excels.  It may just be my personal preference, but the bright, colorful, and lively art style used in this anime is one of the best I have seen.  Characters, as well as the environments, are represented quite well in this style.  Every main character stands out from one another and their environment, but not so much so that they are the only thing you can focus on.  The \"sharpness\" of the images makes it seem like your watching it in great quality every time, even if it isn't in HD.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe opening and ending themes were quite fitting for the type of anime this is.  The opening is light and enjoyable, with just a hint of seriousness.  I actually found myself going back to listen to it a few times purely because I enjoyed it so much.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nHoshizora e Kakaru Hashi has a large list of character types including: A loli, a tsundere, an incredibly shy girl, and an airhead.  These different character types actually work well to complement each other.  My problem with the characters was the lack of development.  Each character only had a few episodes in which to develop.  Some characters don't even get a chance to be developed either.  Also, at some points it seemed like some of the characters were forgotten and simply put in later episodes to let us know they are still there.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nDespite my complaints, I actually enjoyed watching Hoshizora e kakaru Hashi.  There was an episode or two I didn't care for, but for the most part I really had fun watching this anime.  It doesn't need to get a 10/10 to be enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nHoshizora e Kakaru Hashi wasn;t the greatest thing I have ever seen, but it was actually pretty good.  These are just my opinions though.  This anime may end up being your favorite of all time.  I recommend that you at least give it a chance.",

However taking that aside the characters are all very likable and the protagonist Hoshino is actually a fun guy to watch as well. Despite not being too unique this anime does very well what it sets out to be. It had me hooked and interested from the start and i could not wait to find out who Hoshino ended up with in the end. So ifthis is the sort of anime you like, then you will probably enjoy it as much as i did.",

            "content": "The anime was really, well, how should I saw this... It's some sort of harem that indulges in dreams, hopes and of course, the element an anime never misses- romance. \r\n  The anime talks about the main lead Kazuma Hoshino who had always cared for his (overly cute) little brother. It talked about his experience when situated in a rural environment. \r\n  The story in general was good. You might feel familiarize if you're a bookworm or a movie mania, but it's still good. It's not the 'OH THIS IS ORIGINAL AND UNIQUE' type of anime, it's just your another'OH THEY'LL END UP TOGETHER OMG CAN'T BREATH OTP IS HERE' anime, but still, it'll make you scream, laugh and cry nonetheless. \\n\r\n  The art style is great. I'll tell you that the visuals is so exquisite. Starting from Kazuma's cute and boy-next-door style all the way to Madoka's style is amazing. The visuals was just so pretty that it made the anime more enjoyable. I just had the thing against the style of their uniform (well, you'll realize that when you see how it looks on Madoka). I mean, no offense, it looks simple and absolutely adorable, but the tie, meh. \\n\r\n   The sound is great! I love all the songs and the starting theme! It gives us this exciting vibes and stuff. I usually skip anime intros because God knows how long they take, but I didn't skip the intro in this particular anime. The sound was just so great and it fitted with the video that I cannot help myself but watch it fully. The sound was able to relate with the mood and help the viewers indulge with the atmosphere more.\\n\r\n   The characters were good, I guess. I would appreciate it though if it showed more about how Kazuma's feelings developed, since I really shipped him with someone else. Ui's characterization was really clever, she was a bright and cheery character that always has an eye for food (especially cheese) (OMG EP 2's cheese still in my head). Madoka's characterization was rather strong and detailed- which resulted her to become my favorite character in the manga. Overall, the characters were nice.\\n\r\n  I enjoyed the overall story and had only a few critics regarding it. I really love it, honest. I'll probably recommend it to my friends. I also recommend it for those who are reading this review now. This anime is good, the 12 episodes is probably short for you but I assure you that you'll endure an episode of laughter, tears, and probably cringing at a whole lot of exchange of dialogues!",

            "content": "Let me just say this is my first review, so please bare with me. \r\nHoshizora e Kakaru Hashi is possibly the most tragic rom/slice of life i've ever seen.... Not that it was overly dramatic but the story really didn't measure up to my expectations. \r\nStory:3 \r\nNow I personally like the story regardless of the cliches. It wasn't spectacular but it wasn't so awful i had to up and quit the show. \r\nArt:7 \r\nI loved the art. It was a little too glossy for my tastes but it was well done and the characters looked nice :).\r\nSound:7 \r\nThe sound was great. Not horrible, Nothing thatwould bug you during viewing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:6\\n\r\nI'd have to say even though the characters seemed to just be like any other characters from any other harem, they had this feel to them as if they were each unique in their own sense. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:6\\n\r\nThe story line was your run of the mill harem. You had your karaoke and your beach seen. They also included the other events you usually see.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:5\\n\r\nNow i'm not gonna say this was the worst anime I've ever seen but it was far from the best. The twist at the end will leave you puzzled thinking. \"WHO THOUGHT THIS WAS OK?\" The story up until the last 2 episodes was pretty genuine though. I thought it was going for a feeling sort of like AIR or KANON. Don't be too judgmental though and pass up on this anime due to the reviews or forum posts. It's not as bad as it seems. The reason the anime probably got the awful reviews was due to the ending. Which I'll leave you to critique yourself. If your gonna give this a shot though make sure to be prepared because your either gonna hate it or your gonna love it.",

            "content": "Hoshizora is an interesting ecchi-based harem, so much so that it took two complete viewings for me to collect my thoughts. It isn't a particularly innovative series but still manages to entertain through decent character interactions and late-building tension. Despite giving very early signs of which harem girl will win Kazuma's hand, the series still puts forth a decently plausible plot line, especially compared to some of the other flops of 2012. If you're looking for a simple harem devoid of senseless action or magical elements to spend six hours on, look no further.\r\nAnimation:\r\nHoshizora is a fair looking series with minimal CGI elements and somepretty good looking water effects. It uses a pleasing color palette ranging from a slightly under-saturated base appearance to heavily-oversaturated scenes (such as sunsets). The backgrounds are also quite good; in fact they are so detailed at times that the less-detailed characters look comical when superimposed in front of the background. While lacking in details occasionally, the character styling is fairly good. All important characters are easily distinguishable, including siblings with impossibly different hair colors. My only major critique is Ui; the real world is not so forgiving to those who gorge on monster parfaits and snacks on a daily basis. The series could have also done with a better QA as there were instances of mysteriously, instantaneous costume changes.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a relatively calm series where the highlight in terms of action is a school race. There's no hint of magic (other than Ui's metabolism) in this series as well. What you will find, instead, is a fairly generous portion of ecchi panty shots and naked scenes full of god rays and mystic mist. The series' overall approach is a bit more conservative than 30-sai in terms of sexual references and the characters are (thankfully) a bit more mature in feel than those in R-15.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nEach episode starts with a progressive but melodically challenged OP. It starts as a calm lullaby but then evolves into a frantic-paced jpop song. I can't put my finger on it but I didn't particularly like the singer's voice. The main ED is a fast and playful work that sounds as if it served as the baseline inspiration for Nichijou's OPs. It heavily relies on synthesized sounds, which makes it blend with the BGM quite well. The 10th episode is special in that Madoka gets her own fitting ED, you can probably guess why. The BGM is unusually limited in variation so be prepared to hear the same playful synthetic songs over and over.\\n\\n\r\nAt the time of its release, the voice cast for this show isn't what I'd consider an all star team. While the VAs gave an adequate performance, I think the script severely limited them at times. Consider the following example from the first episode:\\n\\n\r\nKazuma (with an incredulous tone): \"Hey... you're a girl?\"\\n\r\nUi: \"Yes, I'm a girl.\"\\n\\n\r\nI still can't quite grasp what the scriptwriter was thinking at some points. Script aside, I was also a bit annoyed at how girlish Ayumu sounded. Overall, don't expect this to match the level of drama in other shows such as Ano Hana.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nKazuma and his weak brother, Ayumu, move in with a family friend in a quiet, rural town, where the residents gloat about their convenience store that closes at 8PM. Soon, Kazuma starts bumping into girls (literally) left and right and before you know it a harem has developed.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is told in a slice-of-life, episodic manner with only minimal connectivity. It's a bit strange in that episodes sometimes end abruptly, not at cliffhangers but just as if the director decided to chop up one long movie into chunks. The overall pacing is a bit slow and, with the random episode transition points, the series doesn't really push you forwards.There are a handful of episodes where the ending isn't so arbitrary, specifically episodes that focus on a particular harem candidate. The story doesn't really have any rising action until the last two episodes, which builds to a predictable but satisfying climax and conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the plot is extremely predictable and closely follows established harem patterns. The majority of the involvement comes as a big lump towards the end of the show so pace accordingly. Compared to other shows in its season, the story is a bit boring and overly conservative. Luckily the characters bring a bit of life to the series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nKazuma is your typical harem lead, a nice dude who is oblivious to girls' feelings and who blushes at anything ecchi. He somehow miraculously adapts to the slow pacing of rural life after having living the majority of his life in \"the big city\" and is shortly somehow surrounded by all the school's idols. The series makes use of a lot of established character patterns (useless comic-relief guy friend, a bunch of tsunderes to spice up the mix, etc.) but successfully presents them in a mostly plausible manner. Though, honestly, the bulk of the juicy, drama-filled interactions occur very late towards the end of the show. This is where you'll find some decent character development and some hard choices. If not for this last glimmer of inspired presentation (similar in feel to the better parts of Mashiro-iro Symphony), I would have called this series a flop as well.\\n\\n\r\nValue:\\n\r\nOverall, the series had some decent comedic scenes as well as some solid development late in the season. If you can deal with some minor inconsistencies and some shamelessly haphazard episode transitions, this series is a fair watch. It treads on very safe grounds using existing cliches and harem patterns but is brave enough to at least forces a conclusion that may disappoint some fans. This is by no means an outstanding harem, but seeing how bad some of the other 2012 harems have been, it seems directors ought to be looking back in time for some much needed inspiration.",
