            "content": "If God suddenly decided to abandon the world, what'd happen to its people? If no one else can be born however, no one else can also die, what'd happen to Earth?\r\nI'll try to keep the review as spoiler-free as possible but if I do post one, it was an accident and I apologise in advance.\r\nStory [8/10]\r\nThe plot is actually, in my point of view, really complex. God abandoned earth, in this \"new earth\", people can no longer be born however, people cannot die as well.\r\nHowever, before giving in to the world, God left behind \"Gravekeepers\", gravekeepers are the only ones capable of actually killing, orto be more specific, \"put ease to the souls\" of the dead by burying them.\\n\\n\r\nThe story begins with a girl named \"Ai Austin\", she's 12 years old and she belongs to the last generation of borning humans since god abandoned earth 12 years ago. Ai's a gravekeeper and eventually embarks on a journey to search for herself and later, save the world.\\n\\n\r\nArt [9/10]\\n\\n\r\nThe art matches with the theme of the anime and their quality is top notch. The characters are well drawn and I didn't feel any kind of \"lazy animation\" throughout the whole series, all the colors are adequate with the theme and style of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound [10/10]\\n\\n\r\nI really really loved Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi's OST, the OP and ED were both really addicting and equally good and the OSTs blended really nicely with the scenes, it comes in the right moments and really helps establishing and improving the emotion of the watcher because let's be honest, mood-music is the best thing ever and adequate mood-music it's even better.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters [7/10]\\n\\n\r\nI will confess that I felt kind of annoyed by Ai in the first couple episodes for a 12 episode anime her development was really well done and by the end I had already fallen in love with her and all the other characters that came across her way.\\n\r\nThe development is really well done for a 12 episode anime and I was able to understand and feel emotionally connected to all characters, share their suffering, pain and problems.\\n\\n\r\nOverall [9/10]\\n\\n\r\nKamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi was a great anime and probably one of the best this summer. The characters are unique and not really cliche'd, are nicely developed, allowing you to feel connected to all characters, the plot is entertaining and different and merging with different themes that usually aren't a part of only one anime. The art is of good quality and the soundtracks will give you plenty to look forward too even after you finished the anime (I'm looking at you, ED song).\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a good story, with interesting characters a some plot twists, then Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi is the anime for you, and I'm sure you'll enjoy it as much as I and others did.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review and have a great time watching Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Sunday Without God is definitely the \"surprise masterpiece\" of the Summer 2013 season. I picked up this anime at the beginning of the season not because I had heard about it a lot previously, but just because the plot synopsis seemed interesting--Very glad I did. \r\nThe anime focuses mainly on \"Ai,\" a girl who is attempting to find her path and purpose in life. She lives in a universe where god has abandoned the entire world, which has left some adverse side-effects, naturally. Humans can no longer reproduce, and even if a human dies he is not really dead--He/she still functions as a normal human,but they can never be at peace. Before his departure, however, god appointed \"gravekeepers\" to preside over the dead. If you are dead, and you can get a gravekeeper to bury you, you can truly die and be at peace. Ai is one of these gravekeepers, and she is on a search to find herself. While I can obviously go no further into the story in order to avoid spoilers, I can say that the story is *extremely* engaging and is constantly developing. The amount of emotion and depth that the studio was able to pump into twelve episodes is staggering. \\n\\n\r\nPopulating the story is a cast of extremely diverse and lovable characters. While time is spent on certain ones more than others, they all contribute to the story in important ways. Even characters that only appear for an episode or two are still very memorable. Definitely one of the best overall casts I've seen in a while. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound matches up with the rest of the anime in their quality. Vibrant colors and moody lighting effectively bring the world to life. The soundtrack is definitely superior to the average fare, especially some of the tracks meant for more emotional moments. The OP and ED both shine as being fantastic, the ED even more so--It's one of the best I've heard in a while. The voice acting is also top-notch--No complaints here.\\n\\n\r\nAs short as Sunday is, there's really no excuse to not at least give it a go. The plot is engaging and emotional, the characters are dynamic and colorful, and the quality of the art and sound bring everything to the point of near perfection. I think that I definitely name this one my favorite of the Summer 2013 season. \\n\\n",

            "content": "There are seven days for a weekend. There's Monday through Friday where people work fruitlessly to create a better world. There's Saturday where people gets a chance to enjoy the world where we live in. Then, there's Sunday where there's a chance to relax as the cycle begins all over again. Well if there's God exists, we know that he created a world for us to enjoy. But on Sunday, he decides to take a vacation. Sounds like fun right? Well, maybe for him but definitely not for us. \r\nWelcome to Sunday Without God, a world where God decides to forsaken the world. \r\nKamisama noInai Nichiyoubi (also known as Sunday Without God) is a series adapted from the light novel of the same name written by Kimihito Irie and illustrated by Shino. The series tells the story of a young girl named Ai living in a world without God. Apparently, God has abandoned this world fifteen years ago and now, new humans are no longer born and the dead can no longer die. Luckily, there are beings known as gravekeepers that can maintain balance and bring peace to those who are deceased. It's not exactly a pretty story to imagine especially since Ai has taken the responsibility to prepare graves for a village where its people will eventually die. Do you fear death? I'm sure most people do but in this series, it takes on a whole new twist at that concept.\\n\\n\r\nFor starters, the series takes on a fantasy theme with its setting. In fact, it's clear that the world Ai resides in is not something you'd witness in everyday life. Rather than being realistic, this show relates to the concept of death in a more imaginative way. \\n\\n\r\nAi is an interesting character to take notice of in this show. She is only 12 years old but bears a huge responsibility as a gravekeeper. We can also tell that she had a strong bond with her mother based on various flashbacks that are played throughout the series. But because of her young age, Ai is one of those characters that are a bit naive with how the world functions. Even more complicated though is the state of the current world that she resides in without a God. As this becomes a source of mystery, there are many questions that viewers may be interested in from the start. For Ai though, she has some questions of her own regarding her father and why the world she resides is at this state. \\n\\n\r\nAs if mysteries weren't enough, we also get to meet a young man named Hampnie Hambart from the beginning. There are even more mysteries regarding this man as Ai is convinced that he might be her father. There's little resemblance (at least physically) between Hambart or Ai. In fact, Ai looks much closer to her mother as opposed to this man. And if that wasn't enough, Hambart's violent debut makes Ai feel a bit intimated with his morals. There is a certain calculating factor about Hambart throughout the show that makes him an interesting character as well. In fact, one might interpret Hambert as more of an anti-hero. One could relate to the fact that he \u201ckills\u201d people in order to lay them to peace with his gun. At the same time, it's clear that he wishes to just put them to peace at last rather than letting them bear their existence in a world without God. More importantly later on though, we learn a shocking revelation about him and his fate might also come as a big surprise. \\n\\n\r\nThe series focuses on Ai's development but at the same time, we also get to meet others such as Scar, Ulla, Alis, Dee, and among others of interest. All of these characters possesses their own ideologies and their view of the current conditions in a world without God. Of these characters, Alis is a one of the more noticeable ones with a similar resemblance to Hambert. More importantly though, he has the same motivation as Ai in order to save the world but takes on a very different perspective in doing so. Talk about being on a totally opposite scale. Furthermore, most of the characters in this show has their own supernatural abilities of which we get to witness later on. In such a fantasy world, it should be expected. \\n\\n\r\nThe series focuses its main premise quite a bit but also takes approaches at settling off other directions with its various arc-like format. The beginning part clearly goes straight into the point, second half goes on a more in depth exploration of Ai's character as she meets others while the third focuses on other settings of their world as well as the other characters. Nevertheless, the plot becomes somewhat loose at various occasions as well as feeling in being dragged out. However, you will expect the unexpected earlier on. Tthe series balances between its serious atmosphere along with comedy at many occasions. Various flashbacks played throughout the show also seems to draw a sense of nostalgia for Ai. She is only twelfth years old and already witnessed things that a girl of her age shouldn't see in today's world. Of course, this might be a bit of an exaggeration as the show lacks realism. Yet, it's a mixture of sadness and pity to see Ai venture on her task as a gravekeeper especially later on.\\n\\n\r\nDespite not being a battle shounen, the show does venture into the action field in a few episodes. It's also surprising to see Ai being able to fight at someone her age. The phrase 'dynamite comes in little packages' fits perfectly for her abilities early on as we witness her skills in the art of combat. Other characters shows off their skills as well in particular Hambert in the beginning and later on Alis with his skills too. Unfortunately, the series isn't designed to look flashy with combat factors so action junkies might be a bit disappointed after completing this show if you're looking for spectacular action. It's also hard to take the series seriously sometimes especially since shovels seem to function as a source of weapon for gravekeepers. Let's not also forget about Ai's age for someone of her age along with that adorable face. It's somewhat hard to imagine that she undertakes a task that is as grim as being a gravekeeper. \\n\\n\r\nTaken a point mentioned earlier though, the series builds on the grim reality of a world where God no longer exists. He literally abandoned the world fifteen years ago, so you might ask yourself \u201cnow what?\u201d Well, if we look carefully, there's zombies roaming on the surface and gravekeepers have to bring order. Most of the gravekeepers themselves are cold but Ai is a girl who seems to be cheerful and caring towards others. We might consider the fact if gravekeepers are born differently or how they came to be. There's a puzzle in identity crisis that exists here that I find a bit troubling as most of the gravekeepers goes on unnamed except for a few prominent characters. Furthermore, the zombies that realms the world are depicted as being undead, acts undead, but seems to very much alive. It strikes me here as a bit of silly but also at the same time intriguing factor to notice in such a world. The purpose of the gravekeepers are also sometimes unclear and their moral standards are up for the imaginations.\\n\\n\r\nIf beautiful was a word to be used, this show would fit that category perfectly in terms of its art standards. Maybe this show could even be titled \u201cBeautiful Sundays Without God\u201d. Madhouse Studio surely set the standards high with its background imagery for this series. It's beauty with expression that is illustrated through its holy like background and sunny atmosphere. At some occasions, viewers might feel as if the world this series takes place in is a dream one might not want to wake up from. (going by art judgement only) On the other hand though, Ai's character might be a bit difficult to get used to with her design especially her petite figure, moe like eyes, and antenna hair. Hambert's albino hair is also noticeable as well. All in all, the artwork expectations are met and I give praise to Madhouse Studio for their production values.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of this series maintains its consistency. The OP song \"Birth\" by Eri Kitamura spells out that holy atmosphere of a world without God. The ED song also illustrates its points through its fantasy elements and background artwork. In terms of OST though, the series retains its theme well especially in more of the emotional scenes. It sets forth that style of tragedy but presents it in a more dramatic way. This is clearly shown in the beginning and other times later on. As for voice acting goes though, average might be a word to describe its casts' performance. Because most gravekeepers seems to lack a personality, there is little to go by with their voice tone. Other times, they are hardly noticeable at all.\\n\\n\r\nIf God truly took a holiday, then this show would be one living hell for everyone. But we look at it carefully, sundays with no God might not be so terrible after all especially with the gravekeepers in check to keep order. The effort to illustrate a series with this type of style is certainly unique and not something viewers might be too used to these days. With minimal fan-service, this show definitely sets forth its premise standards well. For Ai, she is on a journey of discovery and learning more about the world. For people interested in this show though, I hope you discover an enjoyable experience out of this. God may have abandoned the world but abandoning this show would be a chance of throwing away a golden egg.",

            "content": "After reading the latest Kami-no-inai light novel and following the latest anime episodes (no manga read unfortunately), I've got only one thing to say about this.\r\nMagnifique!\r\nGorgeous artwork done in all of the medias of this series, a very different storyline than your average booksale, characters that you would always remember. And god the music, wonderful effects alongside the animation effort done.\r\nOh wait, God should be gone in this anime (haha).\r\nAs somebody very kindly told me about it, I will edit the review and add this\r\nSPOILERS AHEAD, TURN BACK IF YOU DON'T WANT ANYTHING SPOIL!\r\nfor the first chapter of the anime. \r\n(It is awfully hard notto spoil absolutely anything in a review, how could I explain anything without a tiny little bit of plot? OTL)\\n\\n\r\nStory 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAs there cannot be any spoilers, and obviously light novel is far ahead of the anime plot, so this is my opinion based on light novel and anime adaption.\\n\\n\r\nThe light novel compared to animation, is written in more details, describing the adventure of the main heroine, Ai in a mission most people deemed impossible. The story structure (the world) is very different to how a normal reader would find, and in many cases in both anime and novel,  you would have to put yourself into the characters, and blend the world's ideals into your own in order to fully understand. \\n\\n\r\nAs you continue watching, there might be some confusing ideas, and small loopholes that could be neglected. This is the result of cropping the massive storyline of the original plot to fit into the 13 episodes series, and it might result in some unanswered questions. But they also cropped out some of the repeated and long plotlines in the novel, which might bore the readers, and there would be an urge in our minds, wanting the story to progress faster. (especially the Ortus arc, towards the end I just felt a massive drag in plotlines)\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\\n\r\nBest thing in the anime and the first reason when I bought the first novel from the online store, the gorgeous gorgeous illustration of Ai in the front cover of the book. And I could say the same with the anime, the first episode is absolutely beautiful, and it quickly took me in. The golden mists flying randomly in the atmosphere, the evening skies illuminating a quiet and simple countryside, and the characters populating the area. The artwork is that amazing, that I was slightly surprised when I found out the villagers are not as normal as you think, even though I had read the first book 2 years ago.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork also delicately described every possible detail of the characters beautifully, following the novels, so the readers would not feel a massive differences between the animation and manga/novel. And the eyes, the EYES! They definitely drew me in, mesmerizing me and if technology allows, I would slowly walk into the screen and fall into the world. \\n\\n\r\nWay too exaggerating on that part, but thats the magic of the artwork.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\\n\r\nMusic, soundtrack, although it is not as strongly described as the artwork, but it also mixed into the story very well. Although there isn't a miracle magic happening when the music and the plotline comes in the right moment, but it helps fill in emotions and feelings that couldn't be easily discovered through the anime. And to be honest, an anime with bad or no soundtrack (background music) behind is definitely not an appealing anime to watch.\\n\\n\r\nSeiyuu-sans did very well in giving life to the characters, Aki Toyosaki did a great job in voicing Ai, the always growing and learning Ai (although there are still some naivety left in her heart as she is only 12!). But the best seiyuu in the anime in my opinion is definitely Daisuke Namikawa, who voiced Hampnie Hambart, the cold-blooded corpse killer and the first mentor and savior of Ai. When his voice rang up, I shivered slightly from that metallic voice-over, and the two conflicting ideals of the character's mind are shown, with a slight warm feeling in the cold hard demeanor.\\n\\n\r\nMusic is the biggest factor in pulling the scores up to a 9, the Opening and Ending of the anime is absolutely marvellous, building up such a tension enough that I looped both songs three times before watching each episodes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters! Totally loved them!\\n\\n\r\nThe authors have amazingly created these characters that are perfectly suitable in the twisted world structure. Ai, the main heroine, is one of the miracle child in the world. Living in a protective dome, surrounded by adults that pampered her greatly, and so she is ignorant of the perils and chaos in the world. But she is also an analyst and a very observant character, and with her limited knowledge of the world she managed to understand by herself (although most people would still deem it naive or mad). \\n\\n\r\nHampnie Hambart is also a great character, in the first few episodes you might think he is a skilled assassin who kills without remorse, but in truth he isn't trained at all, with only the ability of immortality to protect him. The two radically different viewpoints of the character is what makes it a very memorable character in the anime. Sadly he is a side character and we wouldn't be able to see more of him (Really expecting a side story depicting of Hambart's past!)\\n\\n\r\nWanted to score it higher but I reserved a few points for future episodes to see the full cast.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI scored it 8 in the same reason as the character.\\n\\n\r\nI really loved this series and I am absolutely thrilled to see it on animation. And I definitely wanted it to continue past the absolute barrier of 13 episodes. \\n\\n\r\n-EDITED PART AFTER THE 12 EPISODES-\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI have scored it 8, bit lower as I have expected. I did not enjoy it as greatly as hoped, and the reading of light novel might have wrecked it. As the light novel is written in much detail, I have hoped the anime staff would choose some favourite parts to re-animate from the books (I have to find all the illustrations arts for the novel as I have lost them :( ) And in the end they have whitewashed the series and made it quite bland in my taste, losing some of the best climax scenes in the novel and left a sour note at the ending. I was totally shocked when the anime staff took away the entire TOWER chapter, its reasonable as it is one of the longest after the Dead City, but it is just pure horrible to see it not even appearing as there are some very interesting philosophies of life and the struggle of mankind, and I recommend any new or fans who have read and enjoyed my review to read the chapter; confusing, but also very interesting.\\n\\n\r\nEven though it is not as perfectly ended as I had hoped, but with the mild and warm artwork and music complimenting the anime as it goes, it will still draws me to watch it. (Although not as much re-watch value as the light novel).\\n\\n\r\nAnd to finish up for the edited part, I would recommend every single one of kami-inai fans to read the light novel, at least after dead city (as it is the part where Alis began his entry, and where the story starts to strip away).\\n\\n\r\nShaedowfang 13/10/2013\\n\r\n:)",

            "content": "In the world we live in today, religion is a very big thing. It shapes the minds and the ideals of most, if not all, of the beings on Earth, whether they realize it or not. It's been claimed that the American founding laws were based upon Christian ideals and still plays a key part in the society that America believes in. So when God suddenly abandons the world and leaves the inhabitants of Earth to fend for themselves for all eternity, it's safe to say that chaos would ensue. This is the case that Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi presents to us, and expects usto fill in the pieces in between as the story begins twelve years after God's retreat.\\n\\n\r\nThe story begins with a girl named Ai. She is the central character within this entire series. She receives the most screentime out of any other character and the plot comfortably revolves around her innocent sense of justice. She lives in a small town comprised of people whom she's been around her entire life. Unaware to her knowledge, however, is the fact that everyone around her is already dead, and it is her responsibility to give them all a proper death by burying them. Why does the responsibility rely on her? Because she is a graveskeeper: a being created (somehow) after God's disappearance with the purpose of burying the immortal dead in order to legitimately put them to death. But the surprises don't end there. In comes a mysterious man who runs rampant, \"killing\" every member of Ai's town in a blind rampage of bloodshed and dismemberment. Why is this man killing everyone? And why now? This is one of many struggles that Ai has to deal with in this series.\\n\\n\r\nWhat Kamisama tries to do quickly and early is establish character depth. To give reason behind the characters' actions and why they choose to believe that reasoning. This occurs with almost every character that appears at some point throughout the series. What Kamisama does differently from others, however, is discard the characters as soon as it feels that the character has been properly developed. While this isn't necessarily a problem, Kamisama is faced with an age-old problem that many other anime have dealt with in the past: time. As you will probably recall as you read this, Kamisama is only a one-cour series. In the course of the series, an estimated fifteen to twenty characters come and go throughout the twelve episodes in this series. How many of these characters are given attempted development? Nearly all of them, in a twelve episode series. How the series believes it can give a proper amount of character development to so many new characters episode after episode is bizarre, to say the least. And when a series doesn't give a character enough development, that character becomes both unlikable and forgettable. This is the case for almost all characters in the series as along with the innumerable amount of characters, the series also gives off an uneven distribution of character attention. Ai gets more screentime than any other character in the series, and it shows, as she's the most identifiable character in the entire series. But whether this makes her realistic is a different story altogether.\\n\\n\r\nWith any series that involves a deity of any sort, Kamisama has its share of inconsistencies with miraculous events. Within the series, it is evident that even without a God in place, unrealistic events continue to happen. Perhaps this is due to God controlling the flow of logic within the world, but that, sadly, is never explored. And among these unrealistic feats is another age-old cliche that many other past anime have experimented with: wishing. If one wishes for something \"hard enough,\" their wish has a good chance of coming true. Kamisama uses this as plot convenience for the most part, while at other points it becomes the center of the plot itself. What it doesn't do is explain itself. If God does not exist, how can people grant wishes? Who controls the wishes? The only being capable of doing so would be God itself, but It had abandoned the world as previously stated, so what becomes of this? This also ties in with my theory that God controls the logic within the world, but is never developed any further. Inconsistencies also occur as the characters begin to receive any sort of development. A certain trend that this series likes to take is to have the central character, Ai, give a new, innocent perspective to the horrid, cruel world around her to the characters involved in internal conflict. They take the words of a twelve year-old to heart and convert their ideals to match the more optimistic ideals that she comes up with. Perhaps the series is trying to convey a moral of looking at pessimism with optimism. To take a world without God and view it as a world of extra opportunities at living life. If it means wishing for anything you want, that world is soon to be corrupted regardless.\\n\\n\r\nAs stated above, there are many characters that appear throughout this series, while only a few stay around for the entire series. These rare characters include Ai, Yuri, and Scar. Ai, again, is the central character, and the entire plot revolves around her and her carefree look on life and impenetrable sense of justice. Her development as a character is the most solid of any other character in the series and she becomes the driving force behind most of the resolutions to conflicts that arise within Kamisama. While her development is compact, her likability is a bit shaky. She's likable to the point that she's a cute, innocent child, but that's really all there is to her. She has her own idea of \"profound beliefs,\" but they're hard to take seriously from a child who has been isolated from the outside world her entire life. Combine that with a personality with no visible flaws and you have the reincarnation of God itself. Yuri is a character who is introduced with a dark background. His family had died since God's disappearance and had been wandering around alone before meeting Ai and Scar. He receives some necessary screentime upon his introduction, but the attention on him declines as the series continues. His role eventually becomes \"The Father\" of the group, which only leaves him enough screentime to remind the viewer that he exists. Scar is a graveskeeper like Ai, but unlike Ai, is devoid of any extraordinary personality. She's calm and collected all the time. Her role in the series is very similar to Yuri's as she becomes more of \"The Mother\" to Ai as the series continues. As is typical, her character is quickly discarded in order to better develop Ai's character. All other characters who's names I will not mention for convenience sake are either given very little development or are only relevant for a few episodes. Another example of how the series likes to play favorites.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the things that initially brought my attention to Kamisama was the creamy colors. By that, I mean when the colors of a bold source of light blends in with the characters' expressions or movements that cause them to have unrealistic or bolder facial expressions and shadow features. This type of animation isn't seen much in this current generation and could be considered somewhat avant-garde to new fans of animation. One thing Kamisama does right is make the characters look pretty. The eyes are bold and flashy, and the character design is unlike many seen in any recent anime series. In terms of character animation, I have no complaints. The characters looked okay and they moved okay, despite a certain character's hair color blending into the vivid view of the sunset.\\n\\n\r\nIt's easy to believe that a fantasy anime would use fantasy elements to help progress a plot in the right direction. What makes this controversial, however, is the decision and logic behind it. What makes the disappearance of God so impactful in Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi? After a few episodes, viewers tend to forget that the world is without God, as the series makes little mention of it whenever something goes haywire. The biggest factor in determining the validity of this series is its loyalty to its original purpose: to provide a world that is ruined without God and how the outlook of a single girl can change the views of the people she meets with a single outburst. What makes this world ruined by God's abandonment of the Earth? The viewer is left unsure. The idea that one should look at pessimism with optimism is again apparent with this, but is the world truly pessimistic? Having your wishes granted and being immortal could be a true paradise to some, if not many across the world. What God has accomplished by abandoning the world is never revealed, nor does it provide any sort of clue as to how it accomplishes anything. The only conclusion I can come to after watching this series is that the world can survive without God. All it needs is a mascot to cheer up the denizens among it. In this case, it's a little girl named Ai. May the world rest in peace.",

This series has some of the best art and sound that I have seen, the characters are all extremely well designed, beautiful background and scenery and everything blends very well.\r\nBut that's where it stops for me. \r\nSeries like this just try to jam too much into there short timeframe. Our heroine, Ai, had plenty of character development, but there is only minor character development for the rest of our cast, which we are introduced to 20+ over these 12 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as story goes, I didn't enjoy it. Ai has this big dream to save the world, but instead gets stuck on all these side quests and her dream is pretty much put completely on hold. She is questioning her own dream towards the end, but we never get an answer. She makes the big call of finishing her side quest but we never find out if she will ever do what she set out to do, or any form of conclusion to her own goal.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all the art and sound alone were enough to get this up to a 5 from me, that alone made this quite amazing to watch. Unfortunately most of the characters are forgettable and the story gets lost. Worth a watch but nothing special!",

            "content": "What's the worst medium to adapt into anime? There are, of course, good, average and bad examples of every form of adaptation, but it seems to me (and you may or may not agree with me) that for the most part, light novel adaptations are the ones that seem to fail most often. I'm talking stuff like To Aru Majutsu no Index, Date A Live, Sword Art Online and, most recently, the subject of this review, Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi. Let me just state that this rule is not, of course, universal. Simply general.\r\nWhy is this? Why do LN adaptations seem to struggle? My suspicionrests on the structure of the source material: the one-book, one-subplot, one-climax system that works well for a series of small novels. However, in the case of anime adaptations, a strict adherence to the source material renders the format of the show predictable and, particularly in the case of shorter series with less time to explore the available material, the story arcs rushed and contrived. Without some alteration to the pacing and structure of the story (see Durarara), light novel adaptations will forever fail to achieve greatness.\\n\\n\r\nSo what of Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi, the anime that I've already spent 2 paragraphs not reviewing yet? Well, I'm afraid to say that despite some nice ideas, impressive atmosphere and brilliant production standards, this series is arguably one of the LN Adaptations greatest casualties. Now I've not read the source material, but I suspect that it handles the story much more effectively. That's because in the course of 12 episodes, Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi somehow manages to rush through 5 arcs with a lot of implied complexity, while simultaneously failing to establish any kind of direction, interconnectivity or explanation. The result is a story that entirely fails to satisfy, particularly when you consider that a couple of the arcs (the first in particular) could last 12 episodes by themselves with enough thought. But no, we get 5 poorly explained, rushed and entirely inconsequential arcs when one well-developed arc with sufficient complexity would've suited the show better.\\n\\n\r\nNot that KnIN (abbreviated name ftw) is entirely without the foundations of a good series. In fact, the show has so many good ideas that it simply serves to make it more disappointing that they are handled so poorly. We've got characters that are engaging (with the exception of the lead, whose character development begins and ends with \"cute loli\"), but for the most part they are underused and completely unconnected to whatever central story arc that this show was trying to create. There's a total lack of significance placed on some interesting character conflicts. Likewise, the story has some fantastic fantasy elements focusing on a potentially complex and well-conceived world, but these devices and ideas are never fully explored. Witches? Immortal killers? Cities of the dead? Time loops? Great ideas, but hideously flawed in their execution. I understand that the show is taking the Angel Beats approach of remaining ambiguous with regard to its metaphysical elements, but there's an art to that, in that you actually have to explore elements that you're remaining ambiguous about that provides enough info for us to construct some theories, and KnIN doesn't.\\n\\n\r\nOK, the show has some effective emotive scenes: 2 to be precise, and the Julie/Scar romance subplot could've carried a show by itself instead of being sidelined like it was. But in the case of the 2 high-impact emotional scenes, the \"feelz\" are pretty cheap and dependant on the mood established by the technical elements, rather than any strong relation or connection with events. In fact, in the case of the first example, we don't even get time to feel any kind of emotional connection because the arc is so rushed. Characters established, relationship suddenly present and then climax. No time to build any real empathetic response. And in the second example, the events over which we cry are instantly reversed. Y'know, the old Tasogare Otome x Amnesia, Kanon 2006 \"you-thought-they-were-dead-and-cried-over-it-but-they-aren't-really\" trick.\\n\\n\r\nI believe I just mentioned the technical aspects of the series, and I guess it's safe to say that they are incredibly well produced, but at the same time we've come to expect that from recent releases to the point where high-quality animation is pretty much par-for-the-course. This isn't the early-2000s any more; basically every show gets good animation nowadays. Animation's smooth, character models are consistent and designs are nice to look at. The \"lighting\" effects are probably the highlight of KnIN's aesthetic, as they do manage to lend a relatively awe-inspiring warmth to a fantastic world. The sound is also very effective in establishing the mood, whether the scene be sad, happy or mystical in nature. Some very nice tracks playing the background, and a fairly good (but not fantastic) OP/ED sequence set.\\n\\n\r\nSo what do I have to say in conclusion? Put simply, KnIN is a beautifully-conceived disappointment. It's a show with so many nice ideas, but it's been rung out and compacted so much that it feels a bit too dry. Mediocre, cheap emotion rather than any kind of relateable character conflicts, with the more interesting supporting cast ultimately being sidelined to a static little girl. It never goes anywhere, never does anything and never seems to make a point, and far from being the profound masterpiece that it thinks it is, it's simply pretentious. Yeah, that's the right word.",

A 1.\r\nFirst the good sides, WATCH IF what you care about is :\r\n-pretty art\r\n-pretty soundtrack\r\nDON'T WATCH IF :\r\n-you use your head when watching Animes\r\n-dislike plot holes\r\n-dislike rushed stories\r\n-dislike incoherent characters\r\n-dislike the Deus Ex Machina \r\n(Deus Ex Machina has the negative connotation of an utterlyimprobable, illogical or baseless plot twist that drastically alters the situation)\\n\\n\\n\r\nBecause that's the main problem with this Anime... The story has a very good potential, I won't deny that (and that's why I'd give it an overall 5 if it wasn't for the ending, but I'll explain later), but....it was rushed. Every arc lasts around 3 episodes. Every arc feels rushed and forced. Now, it is a 12 long episodes Animes, so they decided to cover as much as possible (I assume it's based on a novel or a manga). However....to me it's a bad decision. They should have developped the first or the last arc properly or choose two arcs instead.\\n\\n\r\n(I cannot write spoilers so I won't be able to give you examples)\\n\\n\r\nRushed, plot holes, characters' being incoherent and incoherences with the fiction's rules itself. I could excuse that considering they have very little time and made the mistake to want to cover as much as possible, but...as I said above...the ending was too much for me to bare.\\n\\n\r\nIf during the rest of the Anime there was simple incoherences or plot holes, in the ending, not only do you have a complete denial of the fiction's rules but you have two Deus Ex Machina in a single episode... The last one of course... And it is literally rubbed in your face before getting hidden by a supposdly sad scene that should make you forget about the fact what just happened is simply making nonesense not only with the situation it should solve, but also with the fiction's rules (here the role of the gravekeeper is put the dead to rest...and that's it...and what happens in the last episode ? something that was depicted as impossible for gravekeepers; that's just one of the two Deus Ex Machina).\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, you better turn off your brain while watching this, make so as if you don't understand what's going on and just appreiciate the art and soundtrack.\\n\\n",

            "content": "You'll be forgiven for thinking Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi just glorified loli show with superficial theological issues thrown in just to seem deep and intellectual. That's certainly the attitude I went into this anime with; but what I discovered behind its veneer of gaudiness was a genuinely decent plot taking viewers through well thought-out settings populated by characters who, barring the odd few, all had a clear purpose in the story. So before you turn down this anime upon seeing its seemingly pretentious opening, read on; and afterwards, go and finish the first few episodes before deciding whether or not to drop it.\r\nFirst things first.Kami-inai is adapted from a series of light novels, all of which are practically self contained stories revolving around the protagonist, Ai, and the various people she meets along her journey through the world. And as a result, the anime follows an arc structure, with the characters, settings, and events of each arc barely ever appearing again beyond their few episodes. This brings us to deceptive point number one: Ai is the only main character; everyone else, even if they are listed as such, is a supporting character who will not appear again once their arc has concluded.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the arcs are self contained, they all take place in this world which has supposedly been forsaken by God; and here's deceptive point number two. Kami-inai is very, very light on actual theological substance. The focus of its title, and arguably the main draw of the show for newcomers, is really nothing more than a plot device to allow for the plots of each individual arc. But that's not to say that this makes the show bad. Rather, it allows Kami-inai to explore a range of themes across its widely diverse and compelling settings, even if they're not particularly innovative. In fact, it's the settings of Kami-inai that are its true strength, more than making up for the disappointment of the title being mere bait. Of the show's four arcs, two take place in settings tied closely to the arc's theme; and of course, they're both evocative and entirely unpredictable, the latter due on no small part to the arc structure of the series. So at the very least, you'll be kept entertained by the fresh content that comes by every few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nAnother place where Kami-inai really excels is in emotional impact. Again, because each arc is a self contained story, they all end with very emotional scenes; and given how difficult it is to write a good emotional scene, Kami-inai has me more than a little impressed. This is no Clannad, but that doesn\u2019t stop it from being good nonetheless. However, as is the case with all good emotional scenes, there\u2019s always quite a bit of plot beforehand that\u2019s needed to build up all the impact later on, and here\u2019s where viewers might get turned off the show. The plot sections, for the most part, do a brilliant job of exploring the arc\u2019s setting with an appropriate air of mystery; but when it\u2019s not doing that, the viewers are left seeing the characters interact with one another as they do what they have to do. And this usually means seeing Ai being what she is: a loli. I personally have nothing against these segments, but there are those who find Ai annoying as a character and the things she does ridiculous; and certainly there is merit to that view. Not only that, but the show shifts from serious to comedic in tone to accompany Ai\u2019s loli acts, and sometimes the change is so jarring it\u2019s simply not welcome. But since Kami-inai always remedies these annoyances with the emotional parts that follow afterward, they\u2019re not really that much of a problem.\\n\\n\r\nFor all the good that Kami-inai does with its emotional scenes, the said scenes are unfortunately also used at times to cover up gaping plot holes at the end of each arc. Or maybe it\u2019d be better to say that gaping plot holes exist where the writers decided to kick reason to the curb in favour of writing scenes that would make viewers cry, for maximum audience appeal; and of course, this has the neat upshot of making said viewers less likely to notice the plot holes. If you\u2019re the sort of person who can\u2019t stand a shoddily-made plot then you won\u2019t like it when it happens; but thankfully, there is only one real plot hole in the series. So it\u2019s not so bad.\\n\\n\r\nI realise I\u2019ve been praising the arc structure quite a bit in this review. Once you get over the idea that there is no single plot connecting the stories, Kami-inai\u2019s structure actually makes for a pretty good meta-plot, because each arc is as a consequence sharply focused, with zero filler. But that\u2019s within the arcs. So it kind of sucks when the third arc, episodes 7 and 8, is total filler; and what makes it even worse is that characters who are carried over to the next arc are developed here, so you can\u2019t just skip it and move on. You can\u2019t just blame Madhouse for it either \u2013 believe me, I wanted to \u2013 because they were just faithfully adapting volume 3 of the light novel series.  They actually cut it shorter than a standard three-episode arc; but even so, those two episodes alone take Kami-inai and drag it down from something amazing into something merely great.\\n\\n\r\nNow enough of the plot. Kami-inai is a beautifully drawn and animated series; my only complaint is the slight overuse of CGI in the early few episodes, not because they look bad but simply because they don\u2019t fit in with the rest of the animation. But CGI usage peters out beyond those two or three episodes, so it\u2019s not really a problem. The art is bright and colourful, with a slight fantastical tint that sets the world apart from the normal world (or what passes for it in anime); and while the art style sometimes has the characters looking a little flat when viewed front-on, they\u2019re still very detailed and very well drawn. Light and shadow is also used very well, often to great dramatic effect. Simply put, Kami-inai is beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it\u2019s not just easy on the eyes, too. The music is awesome, creating with ease the spooky, mysterious, and heartrendingly beautiful atmospheres that pervade the show. A lot of the emotional impact (and not just the crying scenes) is built on the background music, which should give you an idea of how good they are. Acting, for Ai and her main supporting cast, is consistently good, and all the characters come off as real and believable. And of course, mention must be made to the OP and ED songs, respectively \u2018Birth\u2019, sung by Kitamura Eri, and \u2018Owaranai Melody wo Utaidashimashita.\u2019, sung by Komatsu Mikako (yes, I\u2019m writing the names inverted by English rules. Deal with it). The OP song is catchy and fun song to listen to, if standard JPop fare; but the ED\u2019s is downright amazing. By itself it contributes to a great deal of the emotional impact I mentioned earlier; and even better, Madhouse plays with its ED so that the song will start before the credits roll, and sometimes the whole ED is cut in favour of just letting the credits and song play across what\u2019s going on \u2013 and the emotional impact of those moments is then magnified, pardon my exaggeration, a few hundredfold. It should say a great deal that while I really looked forward to the start of the episode when it aired every Sunday, I looked forward to the end even more.\\n\\n\r\nSo there you have it. If you want good plot Kami-inai\u2019s got it. If you want good setting Kami-inai\u2019s got it, and by the bucketloads. If you want themes Kami-inai\u2019s got it. If you want good characters Kami-inai\u2019s aren\u2019t half bad. And if you want good music Kami-inai\u2019s is damn amazing. So if you\u2019ve haven\u2019t watched this series before or quit at the start because of how stupid it seemed, keep watching and get past the show\u2019s deceptive shallowness to reach the wealth of greatness it has to offer. It\u2019s well worth it.\\n",

            "content": "Story:\r\nOverall Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi (Sunday Without God) has a very premise. What if god left and people can no longer give birth and, while they can still be 'dead', can no longer be at rest without the help of a 'Gravekeeper', special individuals who have the ability to make the dead move on. And as a show involved with helping various character find peace in order to move on, it can get very emotional.\r\nThe pacing for the most part is very good, following 4 mostly self contained arcs over the course of 3 episodes. The arcs are mostly character driven, delving into aspects ofhow society would react to this change in the world.\\n\r\nSome parts of the story however can feel rushed and skimmed over and while the ending was very enjoyable and satisfying, it does leave a lot of the world unexplored and questions unanswered. Episodes 7-9 felt particularly weak in comparison to the rest of the series to me. However the other three arcs were really strong.\\n\r\nIf I had to explain it in one sentence I would say that it's like a cross between the best parts of Angel Beats and Torchwood: Miracle Day.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art is lovely and consistent throughout. There are certain moments (and hopefully without spoiling too much) that happen when the 'dead' are put to rest which are wonderfully beautiful and very much enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nFor me, nothing really stood out too much. However that was partly due to the music matching the gentle and relaxing tone of the anime. It didn't need to stand out and it did its job. It just wasn't memorable. The opening however was very much enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThis is where the show stands out. Being a mainly character driven show it's understandable that most of the effort is expended in making the characters three dimensional in order for the emotional conflict to affect the audience.\\n\r\nThe majority of the characters only remain for their three episode arc in which time we meet them, learn more about them, and grow to care for them. This is especially prominent in last arc. (I may have cried.)\\n\r\nThere are some flaws. Various characters (especially in the 3rd arc) are barely touched on or not touched on at all. And for me a certain character went through a change that seemed to happen too suddenly and with very little explanation. I feel like it could have been handled a lot better. But I understand that 12 episodes isn't much time to fit a lot into.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this. It was sweet and touching and made me cry. There were certain parts that I felt took too long or were glossed over but aside from that Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi was just a really nice series to experience.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nIt's good. It's got relly well done emotional scenes at times but at others there are issues glossed over that I felt could have had more attention paid to them. At 12 episodes long it's definitely worth watching.",

            "content": "A world in which nobody can be born, but nobody dies either. The only way somebody can truly die is by being buried by a Gravekeeper. All of this because God had abandoned the world on a Sunday. \r\nAn interesting concept, is what I thought to myself when I read about Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi (or simply \"Sunday Without God\") and I decided to watch it and I wasn't disappointed in the slightest. As always, let's start off with the story.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nThe story of Sunday Without God both starts and ends interestingly (I won't be spoiling anything). The story opens up with a twelve yearold Gravekeeper by the name of Ai, who takes over as the town's gravekeeper after her mother dies. Then two mysterious men show up and Ai gets caught up in a series of events, but she has a motive of her own: to save the world. As much as I loved this anime, the story starts off strong, but gets a bit weaker . I won't say why, you'll have to see for yourself. I'm not saying the ending was bad! But I won't say if it was good either to avoid spoiling. Despite this, I give the story a 7/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nThis being a very recent anime, it has impeccable artwork done on it. Art is always important to me when I watch anime, and Sunday Without God did not disappoint. The second I laid eyes on it, I was simply amazed by how beautiful it went, and how well the art complemented the story.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nNo problem with the sound. It was brilliant. Not much to say.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nThere is no doubt in my mind that Sunday Without God has characters in it that you grow attached to. There are characters in this anime that you will love, and perhaps for no reason at all. Many characters I found myself loving the second I laid eyes on them. There are no characters that just act so antagonistic that you can't help but hate them; every character is loveable in some way or another.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nOften I find myself zoning out when I watch anime. However this isn't an issue when it comes to watching Sunday Without God. From the very get-go I couldn't get myself to stop paying attention. Yeah, sure, this anime doesn't have a plot that goes throughout the entire twelve episodes, but it has several smaller ones, each more interesting than the last.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nI give this anime an overall rating of 7. Why 7 and not 9 or 10 after I spoke so highly of it? Well, this anime surely has its positives: Outstanding artwork, amazing characters and a very interesting idea for the overall story. However, I have to mark it down as I was expecting it to stick more to the idea of people not being born anymore, and people dying but not actually dying until being buried by a Gravekeeper. At times it seems like they threw the idea out the window. They didn't, of course. It just didn't seem very important at times. I know you can't have the same bland crap being thrown at you every minute of every episode, but I don't feel as though there was enough of it in there.\\n\\n\r\nMy final verdict is: give this anime a try! Hopefully you will love it like I did.",

            "content": "Starting notice: a sudden desire urged me to try a different kind of review. So the following stream of words consists of two completely separate reviews, segregated by The Wall. Read it your way and enjoy it, for this is the main reason I guided some additional trains of thought through my brain.\r\n\"The world is no longer the same it was.\"\r\nSo, I immerged again... right into a new anime world going by the meaningful name of \"Sunday Without God\". Yes, God has literally left this world, bereaving humanity of its most essential abilities, namely giving birth and dying for good. In order to prevent thebodies of people who would actually die, but cannot anymore, from rotting away, the so called gravekeepers are capable to grant them their final rest. \\n\r\nAnd one of these gravekeepers is Ai, a 12-year-old, slightly spoiled girl who doesn't know anything of the world outside her calm home village. But suddenly, by some unfortunate coincidences, she is forced to leave her self-built cage of quietness and has to enter a world unbeknownst to her. \\n\\n\r\nGetting in contact with other peculiar characters trying to come through life without a god, not much time flows by before she has to deal with important questions like: How can this world be saved from its fate? Is dying actually that bad after we know it has been taken from us? What does it really mean, being a gravekeeper? Or how can I let my comrades remember the positive side of life?\\n\r\nThe last point mentioned leads me to Ai's personality. Somehow she reminds me of Taiga from Toradora with her looks, and so I initially thought of a more tsunderish behaviour to be seen. Nope, Ai starts pretty girlish, a bit impulsive, but stays calm enough, and the life in the village made her naive against more complex things. And then, as the anime advances, especially since it is only 12 episodes long, I really have to compliment how firm and diversified she becomes towards the end. I don't use this word often, but I have to admit that, all in all, Ai is just cute in both her appearance and her behaviour. \\n\r\nThe other characters are all likeable enough. They don't experience the same kind of development as Ai, but have their stories to tell and sometimes mentionable traits to reveal. You certainly won't get bored by them.\\n\\n\r\nA last mention on the main story. It doesn't meet a final or conclusive end, so maybe you will be a bit displeased. But you know, there is always the possibility to read the novel, which I actually haven't read, but certainly it contains satisfying answers to your remaining questions.\\n\\n\r\nArt- and soundwise actually only one word is needed: Enchanting.\\n\r\nTo give some more annotations for the detail-loving ones: Since quite a few scenes happen during dawn or dusk, oftentimes this 'yellow' prevailing mood is conveyed. And this is accompanied by astoundingly stunning light and shadow effects. The enchanting soundtrack gets noticed and varies to suit the special mood without a God. Animation is fluid and has some awesome 3D-rides in store, showing up even in the opening. Now that I mention it, both opening and ending are beautiful and nearly melancholic for me now. They won't get boring too soon like so many other ones. \\n\\n\r\n\"Each of us sees a different world.\"\\n\r\nSo, these words are optimal to impart my final thoughts. This series turned out as an unexpected fabulous tale, and so, in case you relish anime with an enchanting atmosphere, an adorable girl as lead character and themes like dealing with the dead, then for God's sake, watch it. And even if you see the world in a different way than me, you still have to assert that this show is a million times better than the crap today's television mainly provides. Deem these 12 episodes as a present to fulfil your life.\\n\\n\r\n____________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\n____________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\n____________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnother day without the God...\\n\r\nWhy did he leave a world so torn?\\n\r\nThe dead walk on, are left to rot\\n\r\nand human life cannot be born.\\n\\n\r\nSo gravekeepers are bound to give\\n\r\nthe walking dead a gentle fall.\\n\r\nWe follow Ai who strives to live,\\n\r\nto save the world, to save them all.\\n\\n\r\nBeginning as a naive child\\n\r\nwho doesn't know the world outside.\\n\r\nDevelops firm and inner wild\\n\r\nand lets the better thoughts abide.\\n\\n\r\nDiscovering peculiar guys,\\n\r\nthe dead's country or even school,\\n\r\nreceiving words pensive and wise,\\n\r\nshe slowly learns the keepers' rule.\\n\\n\r\nIn colours mystical and bright\\n\r\nthe world illuminates its thoughts.\\n\r\nWith stunning shadow-use and light\\n\r\nthe people rise above their hearts.\\n\\n\r\nThe music part is not just bound\\n\r\nto great open and ending themes.\\n\r\nSince life and death itself far sound,\\n\r\nthe world is tangible, it seems.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the story doesn't meet\\n\r\nhigh standards or a final end.\\n\r\nEnjoyment smoothly plants its seed,\\n\r\nand I stayed with it where it went.\\n\\n\r\nSo when the tension falls and grows,\\n\r\nyou have to feel and to endure.\\n\r\nBeside some mainstream actions shows\\n\r\nthis is a jewel, that's for sure!\\n",

            "content": "Sunday Without God is one of those animes I watch and I am like, \"How would it be if this actually happened.\" What if this world was one without death, birth or true life in general.\r\nStory 6/10\r\nThe initial story, in a world where god abandoned it may sound really interesting but as far as the anime went it didn't feel like they really touched on the topic that much. It was more about the adventure about the young grave keeper Ai. It is as short anime so it is hard to develop a great story but ehh, it could have been expanded upon much more.\r\nArt9/10\\n\r\nIt is by far one of the more artistic looking animes I have seen. Though its style does not really fit in with the tone of the anime. The anime has a morbid and touchy topic story so you would think think it would look a little darker than what it is.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\r\nI  watched this dub and may rewatch in sub but I gotta say I loved every bit of  sound and voice in this anime especially Ai, she has the most adorable voice in this series. Opening gets you pumped to watch this anime and the credits make such a good closer to any episode. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10\\n\r\nCharacters in this anime seem to have a straight forward personality and beliefs but I feel there is no real character development.  However thats not to say I didn't like any of them. Ai yet again takes the cake here. She is so adorable in every way.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10\\n\r\nI find Sunday Without God to be a really good anime. Its cute but yet very extreme with an usual story. I would definitely watch this anime if you enjoy stories about parallel universes from our own you should definitely watch this anime. Now if you aren't really interested after a couple of episodes I highly recommend sticking around to the end. The final few episodes are very enjoyable to watch and feel very deep. However the ending did leave me with questions on what actually happened.  It such a cliff hanger. But such good anime overall",

            "content": "\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have wishes,\u201d when Alis Color mentioned something like this, at first I didn\u2019t understand. What\u2019s wrong with having wishes? But after his reasoning was explained in a later episode, I realized the meaning of those words. Actually, it was at that point I finally realised what this anime was all about. Working hard to make your dreams come true, is what makes life interesting, right? To find the reason why I say this, you should watch Kamisama no Inai Nichyoubi for yourself.\r\nKamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi or Sunday Without God is set in a world where God abandoned the world 15 years agoon Sunday. The result is a world where nobody dies. This \u2018eternal life\u2019 has it\u2019s consequences: people can\u2019t reproduce and the only way to die peacefully is to be burried by a so-called Gravekeeper. Ai Austin is a young girl raised in a beautiful village, when a man called Hampnie Hambert appears before her, who claims to be a \u2018man-eating toy\u2019 and of who her deceased mother once told about. A sudden turn of events takes place, which changes the peaceful life Ai has been living until now. After her village is destroyed, Ai is destined to travel the vast, unknown world in a quest to save it. But saving the world with people who all look differently at this world, and is filled with dilemmas, isn\u2019t easy. The somewhat heavy themes and dilemmas make this story very interesting. The storytelling is great and as we follow Ai, who knows equally as much as we do (let\u2019s say nothing) about this world, we discover more and more about the world. And when you think you know the situation, it appears something completely different. With each problem solved, more questions arise. The great plottwist and mysteries make this a thrilling show, and each episode you wonder what will happen next.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this anime is brilliant. Beautiful colors, detailed surroundings and lovely characterdesigns. The animation looks fluent and great camerawork that makes the more intense scenes really stand out. The soundtrack accompanying the scenes is great as well and gives the show the right atmosphere, from heartwarming to emotional moments. I loved both opening and ending, and the voices fit really well with the characters. I have nothing more to say about this.\\n\\n\r\nThe heroine Ai Austin is a lovely, but na\u00efve girl and her reactions seem a bit stupid sometimes, but if you think about the way she is raised until recently, it\u2019s completely understandable. Her being bewildered by the new experiences, wanting to save everyone even though that\u2019s impossible and pondering over the dilemma\u2019s what everyone would do\u2026everything makes sense. Her character development is slow, but the subtle changes are there. The other character\u2019s thoughts and reasonings are well explored too and that makes them realistic. Their backgrounds are often sad and I have shed some tears over them during the show.\\n\\n\r\nI like this kind of anime really quickly. Maybe it\u2019s a bit singleminded, but I consider this a masterpiece, simply because it touches a sensitive chord in me and that\u2019s very important when I watch or read a story. After every episode I kept wondering about the situation, and tried to find my own answer to the vital questions popping up while watching the show. The ending solved the issues well, making me tearful (yes, I cry very easily) but satisfied. Yet there are many questions left unanswered and I hope there will be some answers in the 13th episode which will air later, or hopefully in a sequel. I loved Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi very much!\\n\\n\r\nI hope you\u2019re all working hard to reach your goals, because that\u2019s the only way to make your dreams become reality. And live your life to the fullest to be happy, rather than to wish for an eternal life.\\n",

She was kawai~ and Clumsy and klutzy and kirei-desu. I mean she was so strong and determined that I loved her.The characters Like Scar, Humpmei Hambart, Yuuki, Alice are the only ones i could remember the others did not leave much of an impression.Even we did not get to see much of these characters...I mean I would not mind having given some past of these characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment [9/10]:\\n\r\nHaving some flaws this anime was the best anime choice that I made at random. I enjoyed watching every moment of it.It was heart warming and easy perceptions story.There were fair amount of friendship and love.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL [8/10]:\\n\r\nOverall I loved this anime.The art animation, characters, story and a fair amount of romance made this anime of the good ones for me.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend you try this anime.

            "content": "What would you do is one day God abandoned the world and made it so that birth and death no longer existed? No longer would you age or have babies. The only thing waiting was eternal life, even if you never wished for it. Then, one day, people called Gravekeepers come to bury those who have died, making death an option again, but also making it harder for those who wants eternal life. That is Sunday Without God. \r\nOkay, let's get down to business. The story of Sunday Without is very interesting to say the least. It's original, exciting and just full on fascinating. Wefollow a young Gravekeeper called Ai on her journey to see the world. Along the way she meets many different characters who each have a role they must play in order to live. This story had me from the beginning. It felt like nothing I had seen before, and held me very interested. Though we follow Ai on her journey, there are many smaller stories within the big picture. This is where the story gets a little bumpier. It starts mixing in more and more supernatural elements without really explaining them at all. They're just there. There are also times when I thought they could've removed some parts in favor for explanation. Sometimes it tries to have a more everyday life part of it that didn't really fit the story, and it puts the whole finding out about the world thing to the side, which is a shame. We end up getting little to no explanation as to why God left, why supernatural elements are showing up or anything else for that matter. The story started out with so much potential, but falls a little flat in the end. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are a big part of what drives this story along. Most of them have unique personalities and are very likable, though most of them do not get as much screen time or development as I had wished for, but that is to be expected when the anime is only 12 episodes long. I'm only going to talk about three of the \"main\" characters that we see the most of in order to try to avoid as many spoilers as possible. \\n\r\nAi is our adorable main lead. She's a 12 year old Gravekeeper who had lost her mother and been raised by her village instead. She is the only known of her kind since the events of Sunday Without God happens over 12 years after God had left, therefore no child should be as young as she is. She is naive and unaware of how the world truly works, but she is also hard working, slightly spoiled, brave, stubborn and very kind. She's a fun character to follow, and you really grow to like her, though her spoiled nature and stubbornness can get a little annoying. She, sadly, does not get as much development as I would have wished for. She learns through the anime, but it doesn't really change her all that much. \\n\r\nThen we move on to Julie (male). He's a middle aged man who is out for revenge after his wife was killed and buried when he was out of the house one day. He becomes acquainted with Ai and grow a sort of family bond. He is very dependable, logical and good with a gun. Generally a pretty likable character, though he also does not get all that much development in the end. \\n\r\nThe last person I will talk about is Scar. She is a Gravekeeper who is vastly different from Ai, and more like how Gravekeepers should be. She has a mysterious scar across one of her eyebrows, and her main goal in life is burying the dead and helping mankind. She does not harbor any emotion, but smiles a lot in an almost robot like way. She is also the character that gets the most development oddly enough. She learns a lot from Ai and starts seeing the world differently from how she is \"programmed\" to. \\n\r\nThe side characters all get a decent amount of development and are fun to have around, though some of them are unnecessary or just there to move the plot along. The ones that are more important get a lot of screen time and shows change by the end of their arc. They are usually very unique and memorable, and they each serve a purpose in Ai's journey. \\n\r\nThere is also no actual villain in this anime. Though some of the stories has a bad person that our main protagonists has to fight against, they're pretty forgettable. In the end, their enemy is the world and, kind of, God. It's his fault the world is in the complete chaos that it's in, though he is not seen as a villain either. The anime doesn't really need a villain. It, instead, focuses on the mental challenges the characters had to go through, and that makes for many interesting stories. \\n\\n\r\nThe art in this show is stunningly beautiful. It often has a very red and orange or a black and purple layer to it and uses a lot of beautiful contrasts and sharp colors. The backgrounds are amazing and just beautiful to look at, and the design of the world is very beautiful. It had a lot of sunsets and shots of wide landscapes that are just gorgeous to look at. Since the characters are traveling we also get to see many different parts of the world and their contrasts to each other. The post apocalyptic scenery is stunning to look at and very well designed. \\n\r\nIt manages to tone down the more extreme colors when it wants the focus to be on the characters. It also has very pretty character designs where every character looks different from the others, mainly because of the wide use of hair and eye colors. They cleverly use clothes and different heights to make the character unique from each other, and it's easy to see when one person is from another city. \\n\r\nThe animation on the opening is very much like the rest of the anime, using beautiful contrasts and symbolism. \\n\r\nThe ending only pans downwards on a picture of the cast of the anime, and it is a very pretty picture, though it doesn't really do much to get you pumped for the next episode. \\n\\n\r\nMusic is always a big part of the anime. The soundtrack to this anime consists of mostly dark, ominous or calming pieces, often using piano, orchestra and choirs to make it sound more suspenseful. There are also some guitar tracks that are very nice to listen to. It is the perfect OST for when you want calming and atmospheric music. Though I wished there was more variation in the OST, what I got was still pretty good. \\n\r\nThe OP is called \"Birth\" by Eri Kitamura. It uses the wonderful trick of making the anime 50% more awesome just by the use of epic choirs, church bells and organ music. When it mixed together with a rock/pop band it becomes very beautiful and fits the anime very well. \\n\r\nThe ED is called \"Owaranai Melody wo Utaidashimashita (I Sang a Never Ending Melody)\" by Komatsu Mikako and is a calm song with mostly piano, though a slightly electronic band starts playing after a while. It uses some english and a fairly strong bass which gives it more energy. The music in this ED often starts playing before the episode is fully over, and it fits very well as background music. It's a calming and beautiful piece. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the heck out of this anime. I loved the world it was set in and really wanted to figure out its mysteries, which left me pretty disappointed when many of these mysteries were left unsolved. It should have had more episodes or a second season, because it definitely needs more explaining. I enjoyed the journey together with Ai and liked most of the story arcs and characters. Each story had a lot of good points and the story was, to a certain point, pretty unpredictable. And I would say it's worth watching just for the beautiful art style. \\n\\n\r\nOverall this was an anime with a lot of potential, though it fell a little flat in the end. There were parts I wished was done better, but what I got was very good and enjoyable. This is an anime for those of you who love a beautiful post apocalyptic setting with a fascinating premise and a cast of fun characters. You must like having several stories within a story and not mind that sometimes the main plot gets put aside for other things. You must also bear that Ai can be annoyingly stubborn and naive, despite her adorableness. If you don't mind this, then you're in for a fascinating and beautiful road trip through a very mysterious world.",

            "content": "Just when I thought fantasy animes couldn\u2019t come up with an original story, I was mistaken. I started this series without any expectations but somehow, I already had the idea that I won\u2019t be taken by surprise. Apparently, Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi isn\u2019t one to play things like others do and I believe it deserves a better reception than it has.\r\n\tIt may not seem like it from the surface, but the story is quite deep to a certain level. Not only is it complex, but it did as much as to influence my perspective in life. Simply said, the story is rich in ideas andphilosophies. The progression is flawless considering that three unique plots transitioned smoothly between each other for a length of twelve episodes. Events happened in a quick pace and some minor details that would have otherwise clarified everything else were skipped but they\u2019re not necessarily rushed. I was also amazed by how each arc presented a totally new story without compromising the delivery. In addition, nothing is uninteresting and unengaging. \\n\\n\r\n\tOn the other hand, the characters were very likeable despite how I found them to be nearly common as to the rest. Nevertheless, in a short span of time, I became fond of the main character\u2019s qualities of kindness, innocence, and courage. The other supporting characters felt close too. It was also surprising how a lot of characters played important roles and greatly contributed to the development of the series.\\n\\n\r\n\tNot only was the story made well but as well as the overall art. The visuals consisted of stunning sceneries that is shown even from the very first episode. The music used were perfect and did well to amplify the emotions intended. The ending theme was my favorite and I love how it starts to play at the last scenes of the episode before entering the credits. \\n\\n\r\n\tTo sum up, everything from the anime is enjoyable \u2013 the story, mystery, conclusions, music, art and appealing characters. The only problem I found with the anime is that I wasn\u2019t fully satisfied with all of it that I\u2019m wanting for more because unfortunately, the anime is too short. It\u2019s a good thing that even though I only enjoyed it for a short while, it\u2019s still a memorable one. Whenever you decide that you to experience the entertainment of fantasy as if it was your first time, then give Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi a try!\\n\\n",

            "content": "The Sunday Without God is a fantasy type anime that follows Ai Astin, a grave keeper tasked to putting the dead to rest. However, her world is changed when she meets a man named Hampnie.\r\nThe anime is set in a world where God has abandoned the world and as such no one can reproduce or fully die. That is, unless a grave keeper puts them to rest. To be clear, people die but become... undead. As they lose their humanity they change into what could be seen more as zombies. However, the undead can live normal lives. If you are wondering, yes it does soundmuch like Dark Souls.\\n\\n\r\nProbably the most impressive thing the show does is world building. Almost every reveal or aspect of the world that is being built is interesting and adds extra layers to the characters and themes.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I will say is that the first half of the show is much more compelling than second. While a lot of the strengths of the world building and such are still there, the story archs are just not as interesting as the more philosophical elements are not as present later on. It might have to do also that the later episodes seem a lot more cliche and just toss a ton of characters at us instead of focusing on a couple.\\n\\n\r\nIt's interesting that Ai is really the only character I would call a main. She is extremely naive and self-righteous about things. To the point where she can become annoying. Each anime arch she meets characters that not only reveal aspects of the world to her but also new ideas that she has not thought about before.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is Ai's journey, and as such she has to move on from place to place. This causes some things to feel incomplete. The ending itself feels like a cop out, but is understandable. Surprisingly, some of the characters specific to each arch get more development than the more permanent side characters. There are also some instances where important plot points are not explained (mostly for sake of time.)\\n\\n\r\nThe art is stunning. Everything is well detailed and the use of shading and lighting are especially well done. The show is dark when it has to be dark and bright when it needs to be bright. The sound is also pretty good. While not as noticeable as the lighting the bgms are usually well placed and well chosen. Personally I think the OP and ED are good, but nothing to write home about.\\n\\n\r\nThe Sunday Without God has some amazing world building and the art quality to represent that. However, it seems like someone abandoned the show half way through as it turns into a bit of a mess of characters and unexplained plot.",

            "content": "EPIC. This has been added to my top animes. An anime has never drawn out so many emotions from me.\r\nSunday without God is set in a world where God has suposedly abandoned the world and has granted humans a life on Earth as a dead person. The only people who can bury the dead and put them to rest are gravekeepers. \r\nThis is basically about a 12 year old girl named Ai. She takes on her mother's role of being a gravekeeper after her mother's death. Ai takes it upon herself to save the world and goes through many calamities. \r\nStory 10/10 - I haveto say that the story was gold. It was so creative and enjoyable. Like most animes, I thought I could guess what would happen. Unlike most animes, I was completely wrong.\\n\r\nI felt like I died a little inside at the end of the 3rd episode, I have never become so attached to a character after just 3 episodes of any show. The ending was just EPIC. It threw me way off and I literally jumped up screaming WHAT. I know a lot of people called it a troll ending but I thought it was something different.  \\n\r\nAnimation & music 10/10 - The OP and ED were very good and suited the anime. The background music, along with the angles used were so good, it pulled me right into the anime.\\n\r\nThe animation was really beautiful and crisp. The colours and tones used were perfect and during the sunsets, the yellow wash was magnificent. \\n\r\nIt suited the whole theme of no one being able to die because everyone looked roughly the same age to me, well that's how I interpreted it. \\n\r\nCharacters 9/10 - First up, I have to say that Ai is just so cute. She was such a lovable character. \\n\r\nI feel like I attached myself to the characters because after the death of a certain character (no spoilers), I  shatered. All the other characters, mains or supporting, were exceptional. The growth of the characters could be seen and that is very important in a good anime to me.\\n\r\nOverall, 10/10, I thoroughly enjoyed this anime and I really am looking forward to more. I actually cried during some scenes and I have to say that it's very hard to pull a 10 out of me. I am so drawn to this anime that I have taken it upon myself to read the manga.",

            "content": "Sunday Without God is a title set in a post-apocalyptic future where the concept of death no longer exists in the world as those who die are no longer able to pass on and those known as Gravekeepers are the only ones who have the ability to allow those among the undead to be put to rest. Ai is one of those Gravekeepers as she learns things in her small village home and a mysterious white-haired man are not as they seem on the surface, being connected to the unique phenomena that has plagued the world of this series.\r\nBefore I go on with this review,I would like to comment on this show's major weakness in that it doesn't really do much at addressing major elements to its world. It is never explained how the phenomena within Sunday Without God takes place or how particular people are able to gain supernatural powers, hence requiring viewers to accept things within the series at face value. It's essentially a major storytelling issue that one will have to overlook in order to get the most enjoyment out of this series possible.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on from this, Sunday Without God is focused on Ai journeying throughout the world of her series as she explores how others are affected by the concept of death no longer being within the world and acquiring companions throughout her journey that aid her. Most arcs in the series are meant to serve as an observation of how the societies and characters cope with lacking the ability to pass on, with a major element to this series being that those among the undead for prolonged periods of time can drive one to lose their sanity the longer they remain in the world. The Ortus arc addresses how undead within the series live in a society that they can integrate into without being rejected by those among the living, making for the best arc I seen within the series in its focus on what led so many undead to become part of this society. With its observational focus, the series maintains a neutral viewpoint with how viewers take in what they see through the majority of arcs and doesn't preach for one right or wrong viewpoint.\\n\\n\r\nThe only instance a right and wrong viewpoint comes up is during the events of the Goran Academy arc which does cause the series quality to dip to a degree at this point of the series. Beyond this, the only other weaknesses I can remark on with Sunday Without God are that there were some points where I felt there may have been pandering to the audience employed with moments revolving around Ai's naivette and cuteness, as well as the fact that the series lacks a proper ending since the journey of Ai and her companions continues beyond the end of the series as its light novel source material was still ongoing as of the end of the TV anime.\\n\\n\r\nGripes aside regarding aspects to its storytelling, Sunday Without God is still a solid drama title delving into a world that explores how people handle the idea that they can not pass on once they die and focusing on the companions that Ai gains throughout her journey to better understand the world. It's at least worth a look if you like seeing anime that attempt to tell a worthwhile story without being too pretentious over how it tells it.",

            "content": "If God suddenly decided to abandon the world, what'd happen to its people? If no one else can be born however, no one else can also die, what'd happen to Earth?\r\nI'll try to keep the review as spoiler-free as possible but if I do post one, it was an accident and I apologise in advance.\r\nStory [8/10]\r\nThe plot is actually, in my point of view, really complex. God abandoned earth, in this \"new earth\", people can no longer be born however, people cannot die as well.\r\nHowever, before giving in to the world, God left behind \"Gravekeepers\", gravekeepers are the only ones capable of actually killing, orto be more specific, \"put ease to the souls\" of the dead by burying them.\\n\\n\r\nThe story begins with a girl named \"Ai Austin\", she's 12 years old and she belongs to the last generation of borning humans since god abandoned earth 12 years ago. Ai's a gravekeeper and eventually embarks on a journey to search for herself and later, save the world.\\n\\n\r\nArt [9/10]\\n\\n\r\nThe art matches with the theme of the anime and their quality is top notch. The characters are well drawn and I didn't feel any kind of \"lazy animation\" throughout the whole series, all the colors are adequate with the theme and style of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound [10/10]\\n\\n\r\nI really really loved Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi's OST, the OP and ED were both really addicting and equally good and the OSTs blended really nicely with the scenes, it comes in the right moments and really helps establishing and improving the emotion of the watcher because let's be honest, mood-music is the best thing ever and adequate mood-music it's even better.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters [7/10]\\n\\n\r\nI will confess that I felt kind of annoyed by Ai in the first couple episodes for a 12 episode anime her development was really well done and by the end I had already fallen in love with her and all the other characters that came across her way.\\n\r\nThe development is really well done for a 12 episode anime and I was able to understand and feel emotionally connected to all characters, share their suffering, pain and problems.\\n\\n\r\nOverall [9/10]\\n\\n\r\nKamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi was a great anime and probably one of the best this summer. The characters are unique and not really cliche'd, are nicely developed, allowing you to feel connected to all characters, the plot is entertaining and different and merging with different themes that usually aren't a part of only one anime. The art is of good quality and the soundtracks will give you plenty to look forward too even after you finished the anime (I'm looking at you, ED song).\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a good story, with interesting characters a some plot twists, then Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi is the anime for you, and I'm sure you'll enjoy it as much as I and others did.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review and have a great time watching Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Sunday Without God is definitely the \"surprise masterpiece\" of the Summer 2013 season. I picked up this anime at the beginning of the season not because I had heard about it a lot previously, but just because the plot synopsis seemed interesting--Very glad I did. \r\nThe anime focuses mainly on \"Ai,\" a girl who is attempting to find her path and purpose in life. She lives in a universe where god has abandoned the entire world, which has left some adverse side-effects, naturally. Humans can no longer reproduce, and even if a human dies he is not really dead--He/she still functions as a normal human,but they can never be at peace. Before his departure, however, god appointed \"gravekeepers\" to preside over the dead. If you are dead, and you can get a gravekeeper to bury you, you can truly die and be at peace. Ai is one of these gravekeepers, and she is on a search to find herself. While I can obviously go no further into the story in order to avoid spoilers, I can say that the story is *extremely* engaging and is constantly developing. The amount of emotion and depth that the studio was able to pump into twelve episodes is staggering. \\n\\n\r\nPopulating the story is a cast of extremely diverse and lovable characters. While time is spent on certain ones more than others, they all contribute to the story in important ways. Even characters that only appear for an episode or two are still very memorable. Definitely one of the best overall casts I've seen in a while. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound matches up with the rest of the anime in their quality. Vibrant colors and moody lighting effectively bring the world to life. The soundtrack is definitely superior to the average fare, especially some of the tracks meant for more emotional moments. The OP and ED both shine as being fantastic, the ED even more so--It's one of the best I've heard in a while. The voice acting is also top-notch--No complaints here.\\n\\n\r\nAs short as Sunday is, there's really no excuse to not at least give it a go. The plot is engaging and emotional, the characters are dynamic and colorful, and the quality of the art and sound bring everything to the point of near perfection. I think that I definitely name this one my favorite of the Summer 2013 season. \\n\\n",

            "content": "There are seven days for a weekend. There's Monday through Friday where people work fruitlessly to create a better world. There's Saturday where people gets a chance to enjoy the world where we live in. Then, there's Sunday where there's a chance to relax as the cycle begins all over again. Well if there's God exists, we know that he created a world for us to enjoy. But on Sunday, he decides to take a vacation. Sounds like fun right? Well, maybe for him but definitely not for us. \r\nWelcome to Sunday Without God, a world where God decides to forsaken the world. \r\nKamisama noInai Nichiyoubi (also known as Sunday Without God) is a series adapted from the light novel of the same name written by Kimihito Irie and illustrated by Shino. The series tells the story of a young girl named Ai living in a world without God. Apparently, God has abandoned this world fifteen years ago and now, new humans are no longer born and the dead can no longer die. Luckily, there are beings known as gravekeepers that can maintain balance and bring peace to those who are deceased. It's not exactly a pretty story to imagine especially since Ai has taken the responsibility to prepare graves for a village where its people will eventually die. Do you fear death? I'm sure most people do but in this series, it takes on a whole new twist at that concept.\\n\\n\r\nFor starters, the series takes on a fantasy theme with its setting. In fact, it's clear that the world Ai resides in is not something you'd witness in everyday life. Rather than being realistic, this show relates to the concept of death in a more imaginative way. \\n\\n\r\nAi is an interesting character to take notice of in this show. She is only 12 years old but bears a huge responsibility as a gravekeeper. We can also tell that she had a strong bond with her mother based on various flashbacks that are played throughout the series. But because of her young age, Ai is one of those characters that are a bit naive with how the world functions. Even more complicated though is the state of the current world that she resides in without a God. As this becomes a source of mystery, there are many questions that viewers may be interested in from the start. For Ai though, she has some questions of her own regarding her father and why the world she resides is at this state. \\n\\n\r\nAs if mysteries weren't enough, we also get to meet a young man named Hampnie Hambart from the beginning. There are even more mysteries regarding this man as Ai is convinced that he might be her father. There's little resemblance (at least physically) between Hambart or Ai. In fact, Ai looks much closer to her mother as opposed to this man. And if that wasn't enough, Hambart's violent debut makes Ai feel a bit intimated with his morals. There is a certain calculating factor about Hambart throughout the show that makes him an interesting character as well. In fact, one might interpret Hambert as more of an anti-hero. One could relate to the fact that he \u201ckills\u201d people in order to lay them to peace with his gun. At the same time, it's clear that he wishes to just put them to peace at last rather than letting them bear their existence in a world without God. More importantly later on though, we learn a shocking revelation about him and his fate might also come as a big surprise. \\n\\n\r\nThe series focuses on Ai's development but at the same time, we also get to meet others such as Scar, Ulla, Alis, Dee, and among others of interest. All of these characters possesses their own ideologies and their view of the current conditions in a world without God. Of these characters, Alis is a one of the more noticeable ones with a similar resemblance to Hambert. More importantly though, he has the same motivation as Ai in order to save the world but takes on a very different perspective in doing so. Talk about being on a totally opposite scale. Furthermore, most of the characters in this show has their own supernatural abilities of which we get to witness later on. In such a fantasy world, it should be expected. \\n\\n\r\nThe series focuses its main premise quite a bit but also takes approaches at settling off other directions with its various arc-like format. The beginning part clearly goes straight into the point, second half goes on a more in depth exploration of Ai's character as she meets others while the third focuses on other settings of their world as well as the other characters. Nevertheless, the plot becomes somewhat loose at various occasions as well as feeling in being dragged out. However, you will expect the unexpected earlier on. Tthe series balances between its serious atmosphere along with comedy at many occasions. Various flashbacks played throughout the show also seems to draw a sense of nostalgia for Ai. She is only twelfth years old and already witnessed things that a girl of her age shouldn't see in today's world. Of course, this might be a bit of an exaggeration as the show lacks realism. Yet, it's a mixture of sadness and pity to see Ai venture on her task as a gravekeeper especially later on.\\n\\n\r\nDespite not being a battle shounen, the show does venture into the action field in a few episodes. It's also surprising to see Ai being able to fight at someone her age. The phrase 'dynamite comes in little packages' fits perfectly for her abilities early on as we witness her skills in the art of combat. Other characters shows off their skills as well in particular Hambert in the beginning and later on Alis with his skills too. Unfortunately, the series isn't designed to look flashy with combat factors so action junkies might be a bit disappointed after completing this show if you're looking for spectacular action. It's also hard to take the series seriously sometimes especially since shovels seem to function as a source of weapon for gravekeepers. Let's not also forget about Ai's age for someone of her age along with that adorable face. It's somewhat hard to imagine that she undertakes a task that is as grim as being a gravekeeper. \\n\\n\r\nTaken a point mentioned earlier though, the series builds on the grim reality of a world where God no longer exists. He literally abandoned the world fifteen years ago, so you might ask yourself \u201cnow what?\u201d Well, if we look carefully, there's zombies roaming on the surface and gravekeepers have to bring order. Most of the gravekeepers themselves are cold but Ai is a girl who seems to be cheerful and caring towards others. We might consider the fact if gravekeepers are born differently or how they came to be. There's a puzzle in identity crisis that exists here that I find a bit troubling as most of the gravekeepers goes on unnamed except for a few prominent characters. Furthermore, the zombies that realms the world are depicted as being undead, acts undead, but seems to very much alive. It strikes me here as a bit of silly but also at the same time intriguing factor to notice in such a world. The purpose of the gravekeepers are also sometimes unclear and their moral standards are up for the imaginations.\\n\\n\r\nIf beautiful was a word to be used, this show would fit that category perfectly in terms of its art standards. Maybe this show could even be titled \u201cBeautiful Sundays Without God\u201d. Madhouse Studio surely set the standards high with its background imagery for this series. It's beauty with expression that is illustrated through its holy like background and sunny atmosphere. At some occasions, viewers might feel as if the world this series takes place in is a dream one might not want to wake up from. (going by art judgement only) On the other hand though, Ai's character might be a bit difficult to get used to with her design especially her petite figure, moe like eyes, and antenna hair. Hambert's albino hair is also noticeable as well. All in all, the artwork expectations are met and I give praise to Madhouse Studio for their production values.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of this series maintains its consistency. The OP song \"Birth\" by Eri Kitamura spells out that holy atmosphere of a world without God. The ED song also illustrates its points through its fantasy elements and background artwork. In terms of OST though, the series retains its theme well especially in more of the emotional scenes. It sets forth that style of tragedy but presents it in a more dramatic way. This is clearly shown in the beginning and other times later on. As for voice acting goes though, average might be a word to describe its casts' performance. Because most gravekeepers seems to lack a personality, there is little to go by with their voice tone. Other times, they are hardly noticeable at all.\\n\\n\r\nIf God truly took a holiday, then this show would be one living hell for everyone. But we look at it carefully, sundays with no God might not be so terrible after all especially with the gravekeepers in check to keep order. The effort to illustrate a series with this type of style is certainly unique and not something viewers might be too used to these days. With minimal fan-service, this show definitely sets forth its premise standards well. For Ai, she is on a journey of discovery and learning more about the world. For people interested in this show though, I hope you discover an enjoyable experience out of this. God may have abandoned the world but abandoning this show would be a chance of throwing away a golden egg.",

            "content": "After reading the latest Kami-no-inai light novel and following the latest anime episodes (no manga read unfortunately), I've got only one thing to say about this.\r\nMagnifique!\r\nGorgeous artwork done in all of the medias of this series, a very different storyline than your average booksale, characters that you would always remember. And god the music, wonderful effects alongside the animation effort done.\r\nOh wait, God should be gone in this anime (haha).\r\nAs somebody very kindly told me about it, I will edit the review and add this\r\nSPOILERS AHEAD, TURN BACK IF YOU DON'T WANT ANYTHING SPOIL!\r\nfor the first chapter of the anime. \r\n(It is awfully hard notto spoil absolutely anything in a review, how could I explain anything without a tiny little bit of plot? OTL)\\n\\n\r\nStory 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAs there cannot be any spoilers, and obviously light novel is far ahead of the anime plot, so this is my opinion based on light novel and anime adaption.\\n\\n\r\nThe light novel compared to animation, is written in more details, describing the adventure of the main heroine, Ai in a mission most people deemed impossible. The story structure (the world) is very different to how a normal reader would find, and in many cases in both anime and novel,  you would have to put yourself into the characters, and blend the world's ideals into your own in order to fully understand. \\n\\n\r\nAs you continue watching, there might be some confusing ideas, and small loopholes that could be neglected. This is the result of cropping the massive storyline of the original plot to fit into the 13 episodes series, and it might result in some unanswered questions. But they also cropped out some of the repeated and long plotlines in the novel, which might bore the readers, and there would be an urge in our minds, wanting the story to progress faster. (especially the Ortus arc, towards the end I just felt a massive drag in plotlines)\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\\n\r\nBest thing in the anime and the first reason when I bought the first novel from the online store, the gorgeous gorgeous illustration of Ai in the front cover of the book. And I could say the same with the anime, the first episode is absolutely beautiful, and it quickly took me in. The golden mists flying randomly in the atmosphere, the evening skies illuminating a quiet and simple countryside, and the characters populating the area. The artwork is that amazing, that I was slightly surprised when I found out the villagers are not as normal as you think, even though I had read the first book 2 years ago.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork also delicately described every possible detail of the characters beautifully, following the novels, so the readers would not feel a massive differences between the animation and manga/novel. And the eyes, the EYES! They definitely drew me in, mesmerizing me and if technology allows, I would slowly walk into the screen and fall into the world. \\n\\n\r\nWay too exaggerating on that part, but thats the magic of the artwork.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\\n\r\nMusic, soundtrack, although it is not as strongly described as the artwork, but it also mixed into the story very well. Although there isn't a miracle magic happening when the music and the plotline comes in the right moment, but it helps fill in emotions and feelings that couldn't be easily discovered through the anime. And to be honest, an anime with bad or no soundtrack (background music) behind is definitely not an appealing anime to watch.\\n\\n\r\nSeiyuu-sans did very well in giving life to the characters, Aki Toyosaki did a great job in voicing Ai, the always growing and learning Ai (although there are still some naivety left in her heart as she is only 12!). But the best seiyuu in the anime in my opinion is definitely Daisuke Namikawa, who voiced Hampnie Hambart, the cold-blooded corpse killer and the first mentor and savior of Ai. When his voice rang up, I shivered slightly from that metallic voice-over, and the two conflicting ideals of the character's mind are shown, with a slight warm feeling in the cold hard demeanor.\\n\\n\r\nMusic is the biggest factor in pulling the scores up to a 9, the Opening and Ending of the anime is absolutely marvellous, building up such a tension enough that I looped both songs three times before watching each episodes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters! Totally loved them!\\n\\n\r\nThe authors have amazingly created these characters that are perfectly suitable in the twisted world structure. Ai, the main heroine, is one of the miracle child in the world. Living in a protective dome, surrounded by adults that pampered her greatly, and so she is ignorant of the perils and chaos in the world. But she is also an analyst and a very observant character, and with her limited knowledge of the world she managed to understand by herself (although most people would still deem it naive or mad). \\n\\n\r\nHampnie Hambart is also a great character, in the first few episodes you might think he is a skilled assassin who kills without remorse, but in truth he isn't trained at all, with only the ability of immortality to protect him. The two radically different viewpoints of the character is what makes it a very memorable character in the anime. Sadly he is a side character and we wouldn't be able to see more of him (Really expecting a side story depicting of Hambart's past!)\\n\\n\r\nWanted to score it higher but I reserved a few points for future episodes to see the full cast.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI scored it 8 in the same reason as the character.\\n\\n\r\nI really loved this series and I am absolutely thrilled to see it on animation. And I definitely wanted it to continue past the absolute barrier of 13 episodes. \\n\\n\r\n-EDITED PART AFTER THE 12 EPISODES-\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI have scored it 8, bit lower as I have expected. I did not enjoy it as greatly as hoped, and the reading of light novel might have wrecked it. As the light novel is written in much detail, I have hoped the anime staff would choose some favourite parts to re-animate from the books (I have to find all the illustrations arts for the novel as I have lost them :( ) And in the end they have whitewashed the series and made it quite bland in my taste, losing some of the best climax scenes in the novel and left a sour note at the ending. I was totally shocked when the anime staff took away the entire TOWER chapter, its reasonable as it is one of the longest after the Dead City, but it is just pure horrible to see it not even appearing as there are some very interesting philosophies of life and the struggle of mankind, and I recommend any new or fans who have read and enjoyed my review to read the chapter; confusing, but also very interesting.\\n\\n\r\nEven though it is not as perfectly ended as I had hoped, but with the mild and warm artwork and music complimenting the anime as it goes, it will still draws me to watch it. (Although not as much re-watch value as the light novel).\\n\\n\r\nAnd to finish up for the edited part, I would recommend every single one of kami-inai fans to read the light novel, at least after dead city (as it is the part where Alis began his entry, and where the story starts to strip away).\\n\\n\r\nShaedowfang 13/10/2013\\n\r\n:)",

            "content": "In the world we live in today, religion is a very big thing. It shapes the minds and the ideals of most, if not all, of the beings on Earth, whether they realize it or not. It's been claimed that the American founding laws were based upon Christian ideals and still plays a key part in the society that America believes in. So when God suddenly abandons the world and leaves the inhabitants of Earth to fend for themselves for all eternity, it's safe to say that chaos would ensue. This is the case that Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi presents to us, and expects usto fill in the pieces in between as the story begins twelve years after God's retreat.\\n\\n\r\nThe story begins with a girl named Ai. She is the central character within this entire series. She receives the most screentime out of any other character and the plot comfortably revolves around her innocent sense of justice. She lives in a small town comprised of people whom she's been around her entire life. Unaware to her knowledge, however, is the fact that everyone around her is already dead, and it is her responsibility to give them all a proper death by burying them. Why does the responsibility rely on her? Because she is a graveskeeper: a being created (somehow) after God's disappearance with the purpose of burying the immortal dead in order to legitimately put them to death. But the surprises don't end there. In comes a mysterious man who runs rampant, \"killing\" every member of Ai's town in a blind rampage of bloodshed and dismemberment. Why is this man killing everyone? And why now? This is one of many struggles that Ai has to deal with in this series.\\n\\n\r\nWhat Kamisama tries to do quickly and early is establish character depth. To give reason behind the characters' actions and why they choose to believe that reasoning. This occurs with almost every character that appears at some point throughout the series. What Kamisama does differently from others, however, is discard the characters as soon as it feels that the character has been properly developed. While this isn't necessarily a problem, Kamisama is faced with an age-old problem that many other anime have dealt with in the past: time. As you will probably recall as you read this, Kamisama is only a one-cour series. In the course of the series, an estimated fifteen to twenty characters come and go throughout the twelve episodes in this series. How many of these characters are given attempted development? Nearly all of them, in a twelve episode series. How the series believes it can give a proper amount of character development to so many new characters episode after episode is bizarre, to say the least. And when a series doesn't give a character enough development, that character becomes both unlikable and forgettable. This is the case for almost all characters in the series as along with the innumerable amount of characters, the series also gives off an uneven distribution of character attention. Ai gets more screentime than any other character in the series, and it shows, as she's the most identifiable character in the entire series. But whether this makes her realistic is a different story altogether.\\n\\n\r\nWith any series that involves a deity of any sort, Kamisama has its share of inconsistencies with miraculous events. Within the series, it is evident that even without a God in place, unrealistic events continue to happen. Perhaps this is due to God controlling the flow of logic within the world, but that, sadly, is never explored. And among these unrealistic feats is another age-old cliche that many other past anime have experimented with: wishing. If one wishes for something \"hard enough,\" their wish has a good chance of coming true. Kamisama uses this as plot convenience for the most part, while at other points it becomes the center of the plot itself. What it doesn't do is explain itself. If God does not exist, how can people grant wishes? Who controls the wishes? The only being capable of doing so would be God itself, but It had abandoned the world as previously stated, so what becomes of this? This also ties in with my theory that God controls the logic within the world, but is never developed any further. Inconsistencies also occur as the characters begin to receive any sort of development. A certain trend that this series likes to take is to have the central character, Ai, give a new, innocent perspective to the horrid, cruel world around her to the characters involved in internal conflict. They take the words of a twelve year-old to heart and convert their ideals to match the more optimistic ideals that she comes up with. Perhaps the series is trying to convey a moral of looking at pessimism with optimism. To take a world without God and view it as a world of extra opportunities at living life. If it means wishing for anything you want, that world is soon to be corrupted regardless.\\n\\n\r\nAs stated above, there are many characters that appear throughout this series, while only a few stay around for the entire series. These rare characters include Ai, Yuri, and Scar. Ai, again, is the central character, and the entire plot revolves around her and her carefree look on life and impenetrable sense of justice. Her development as a character is the most solid of any other character in the series and she becomes the driving force behind most of the resolutions to conflicts that arise within Kamisama. While her development is compact, her likability is a bit shaky. She's likable to the point that she's a cute, innocent child, but that's really all there is to her. She has her own idea of \"profound beliefs,\" but they're hard to take seriously from a child who has been isolated from the outside world her entire life. Combine that with a personality with no visible flaws and you have the reincarnation of God itself. Yuri is a character who is introduced with a dark background. His family had died since God's disappearance and had been wandering around alone before meeting Ai and Scar. He receives some necessary screentime upon his introduction, but the attention on him declines as the series continues. His role eventually becomes \"The Father\" of the group, which only leaves him enough screentime to remind the viewer that he exists. Scar is a graveskeeper like Ai, but unlike Ai, is devoid of any extraordinary personality. She's calm and collected all the time. Her role in the series is very similar to Yuri's as she becomes more of \"The Mother\" to Ai as the series continues. As is typical, her character is quickly discarded in order to better develop Ai's character. All other characters who's names I will not mention for convenience sake are either given very little development or are only relevant for a few episodes. Another example of how the series likes to play favorites.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the things that initially brought my attention to Kamisama was the creamy colors. By that, I mean when the colors of a bold source of light blends in with the characters' expressions or movements that cause them to have unrealistic or bolder facial expressions and shadow features. This type of animation isn't seen much in this current generation and could be considered somewhat avant-garde to new fans of animation. One thing Kamisama does right is make the characters look pretty. The eyes are bold and flashy, and the character design is unlike many seen in any recent anime series. In terms of character animation, I have no complaints. The characters looked okay and they moved okay, despite a certain character's hair color blending into the vivid view of the sunset.\\n\\n\r\nIt's easy to believe that a fantasy anime would use fantasy elements to help progress a plot in the right direction. What makes this controversial, however, is the decision and logic behind it. What makes the disappearance of God so impactful in Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi? After a few episodes, viewers tend to forget that the world is without God, as the series makes little mention of it whenever something goes haywire. The biggest factor in determining the validity of this series is its loyalty to its original purpose: to provide a world that is ruined without God and how the outlook of a single girl can change the views of the people she meets with a single outburst. What makes this world ruined by God's abandonment of the Earth? The viewer is left unsure. The idea that one should look at pessimism with optimism is again apparent with this, but is the world truly pessimistic? Having your wishes granted and being immortal could be a true paradise to some, if not many across the world. What God has accomplished by abandoning the world is never revealed, nor does it provide any sort of clue as to how it accomplishes anything. The only conclusion I can come to after watching this series is that the world can survive without God. All it needs is a mascot to cheer up the denizens among it. In this case, it's a little girl named Ai. May the world rest in peace.",

This series has some of the best art and sound that I have seen, the characters are all extremely well designed, beautiful background and scenery and everything blends very well.\r\nBut that's where it stops for me. \r\nSeries like this just try to jam too much into there short timeframe. Our heroine, Ai, had plenty of character development, but there is only minor character development for the rest of our cast, which we are introduced to 20+ over these 12 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as story goes, I didn't enjoy it. Ai has this big dream to save the world, but instead gets stuck on all these side quests and her dream is pretty much put completely on hold. She is questioning her own dream towards the end, but we never get an answer. She makes the big call of finishing her side quest but we never find out if she will ever do what she set out to do, or any form of conclusion to her own goal.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all the art and sound alone were enough to get this up to a 5 from me, that alone made this quite amazing to watch. Unfortunately most of the characters are forgettable and the story gets lost. Worth a watch but nothing special!",

            "content": "What's the worst medium to adapt into anime? There are, of course, good, average and bad examples of every form of adaptation, but it seems to me (and you may or may not agree with me) that for the most part, light novel adaptations are the ones that seem to fail most often. I'm talking stuff like To Aru Majutsu no Index, Date A Live, Sword Art Online and, most recently, the subject of this review, Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi. Let me just state that this rule is not, of course, universal. Simply general.\r\nWhy is this? Why do LN adaptations seem to struggle? My suspicionrests on the structure of the source material: the one-book, one-subplot, one-climax system that works well for a series of small novels. However, in the case of anime adaptations, a strict adherence to the source material renders the format of the show predictable and, particularly in the case of shorter series with less time to explore the available material, the story arcs rushed and contrived. Without some alteration to the pacing and structure of the story (see Durarara), light novel adaptations will forever fail to achieve greatness.\\n\\n\r\nSo what of Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi, the anime that I've already spent 2 paragraphs not reviewing yet? Well, I'm afraid to say that despite some nice ideas, impressive atmosphere and brilliant production standards, this series is arguably one of the LN Adaptations greatest casualties. Now I've not read the source material, but I suspect that it handles the story much more effectively. That's because in the course of 12 episodes, Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi somehow manages to rush through 5 arcs with a lot of implied complexity, while simultaneously failing to establish any kind of direction, interconnectivity or explanation. The result is a story that entirely fails to satisfy, particularly when you consider that a couple of the arcs (the first in particular) could last 12 episodes by themselves with enough thought. But no, we get 5 poorly explained, rushed and entirely inconsequential arcs when one well-developed arc with sufficient complexity would've suited the show better.\\n\\n\r\nNot that KnIN (abbreviated name ftw) is entirely without the foundations of a good series. In fact, the show has so many good ideas that it simply serves to make it more disappointing that they are handled so poorly. We've got characters that are engaging (with the exception of the lead, whose character development begins and ends with \"cute loli\"), but for the most part they are underused and completely unconnected to whatever central story arc that this show was trying to create. There's a total lack of significance placed on some interesting character conflicts. Likewise, the story has some fantastic fantasy elements focusing on a potentially complex and well-conceived world, but these devices and ideas are never fully explored. Witches? Immortal killers? Cities of the dead? Time loops? Great ideas, but hideously flawed in their execution. I understand that the show is taking the Angel Beats approach of remaining ambiguous with regard to its metaphysical elements, but there's an art to that, in that you actually have to explore elements that you're remaining ambiguous about that provides enough info for us to construct some theories, and KnIN doesn't.\\n\\n\r\nOK, the show has some effective emotive scenes: 2 to be precise, and the Julie/Scar romance subplot could've carried a show by itself instead of being sidelined like it was. But in the case of the 2 high-impact emotional scenes, the \"feelz\" are pretty cheap and dependant on the mood established by the technical elements, rather than any strong relation or connection with events. In fact, in the case of the first example, we don't even get time to feel any kind of emotional connection because the arc is so rushed. Characters established, relationship suddenly present and then climax. No time to build any real empathetic response. And in the second example, the events over which we cry are instantly reversed. Y'know, the old Tasogare Otome x Amnesia, Kanon 2006 \"you-thought-they-were-dead-and-cried-over-it-but-they-aren't-really\" trick.\\n\\n\r\nI believe I just mentioned the technical aspects of the series, and I guess it's safe to say that they are incredibly well produced, but at the same time we've come to expect that from recent releases to the point where high-quality animation is pretty much par-for-the-course. This isn't the early-2000s any more; basically every show gets good animation nowadays. Animation's smooth, character models are consistent and designs are nice to look at. The \"lighting\" effects are probably the highlight of KnIN's aesthetic, as they do manage to lend a relatively awe-inspiring warmth to a fantastic world. The sound is also very effective in establishing the mood, whether the scene be sad, happy or mystical in nature. Some very nice tracks playing the background, and a fairly good (but not fantastic) OP/ED sequence set.\\n\\n\r\nSo what do I have to say in conclusion? Put simply, KnIN is a beautifully-conceived disappointment. It's a show with so many nice ideas, but it's been rung out and compacted so much that it feels a bit too dry. Mediocre, cheap emotion rather than any kind of relateable character conflicts, with the more interesting supporting cast ultimately being sidelined to a static little girl. It never goes anywhere, never does anything and never seems to make a point, and far from being the profound masterpiece that it thinks it is, it's simply pretentious. Yeah, that's the right word.",

But...this ending totally crossed the line for me and I can't be honest with myself if for once I don't give an Anime's overal rating based on the ending... A 1.\r\nFirst the good sides, WATCH IF what you care about is :\r\n-pretty art\r\n-pretty soundtrack\r\nDON'T WATCH IF :\r\n-you use your head when watching Animes\r\n-dislike plot holes\r\n-dislike rushed stories\r\n-dislike incoherent characters\r\n-dislike the Deus Ex Machina \r\n(Deus Ex Machina has the negative connotation of an utterlyimprobable, illogical or baseless plot twist that drastically alters the situation)\\n\\n\\n\r\nBecause that's the main problem with this Anime... The story has a very good potential, I won't deny that (and that's why I'd give it an overall 5 if it wasn't for the ending, but I'll explain later), but....it was rushed. Every arc lasts around 3 episodes. Every arc feels rushed and forced. Now, it is a 12 long episodes Animes, so they decided to cover as much as possible (I assume it's based on a novel or a manga). However....to me it's a bad decision. They should have developped the first or the last arc properly or choose two arcs instead.\\n\\n\r\n(I cannot write spoilers so I won't be able to give you examples)\\n\\n\r\nRushed, plot holes, characters' being incoherent and incoherences with the fiction's rules itself. I could excuse that considering they have very little time and made the mistake to want to cover as much as possible, but...as I said above...the ending was too much for me to bare.\\n\\n\r\nIf during the rest of the Anime there was simple incoherences or plot holes, in the ending, not only do you have a complete denial of the fiction's rules but you have two Deus Ex Machina in a single episode... The last one of course... And it is literally rubbed in your face before getting hidden by a supposdly sad scene that should make you forget about the fact what just happened is simply making nonesense not only with the situation it should solve, but also with the fiction's rules (here the role of the gravekeeper is put the dead to rest...and that's it...and what happens in the last episode ? something that was depicted as impossible for gravekeepers; that's just one of the two Deus Ex Machina).\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, you better turn off your brain while watching this, make so as if you don't understand what's going on and just appreiciate the art and soundtrack.\\n\\n",

            "content": "You'll be forgiven for thinking Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi just glorified loli show with superficial theological issues thrown in just to seem deep and intellectual. That's certainly the attitude I went into this anime with; but what I discovered behind its veneer of gaudiness was a genuinely decent plot taking viewers through well thought-out settings populated by characters who, barring the odd few, all had a clear purpose in the story. So before you turn down this anime upon seeing its seemingly pretentious opening, read on; and afterwards, go and finish the first few episodes before deciding whether or not to drop it.\r\nFirst things first.Kami-inai is adapted from a series of light novels, all of which are practically self contained stories revolving around the protagonist, Ai, and the various people she meets along her journey through the world. And as a result, the anime follows an arc structure, with the characters, settings, and events of each arc barely ever appearing again beyond their few episodes. This brings us to deceptive point number one: Ai is the only main character; everyone else, even if they are listed as such, is a supporting character who will not appear again once their arc has concluded.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the arcs are self contained, they all take place in this world which has supposedly been forsaken by God; and here's deceptive point number two. Kami-inai is very, very light on actual theological substance. The focus of its title, and arguably the main draw of the show for newcomers, is really nothing more than a plot device to allow for the plots of each individual arc. But that's not to say that this makes the show bad. Rather, it allows Kami-inai to explore a range of themes across its widely diverse and compelling settings, even if they're not particularly innovative. In fact, it's the settings of Kami-inai that are its true strength, more than making up for the disappointment of the title being mere bait. Of the show's four arcs, two take place in settings tied closely to the arc's theme; and of course, they're both evocative and entirely unpredictable, the latter due on no small part to the arc structure of the series. So at the very least, you'll be kept entertained by the fresh content that comes by every few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nAnother place where Kami-inai really excels is in emotional impact. Again, because each arc is a self contained story, they all end with very emotional scenes; and given how difficult it is to write a good emotional scene, Kami-inai has me more than a little impressed. This is no Clannad, but that doesn\u2019t stop it from being good nonetheless. However, as is the case with all good emotional scenes, there\u2019s always quite a bit of plot beforehand that\u2019s needed to build up all the impact later on, and here\u2019s where viewers might get turned off the show. The plot sections, for the most part, do a brilliant job of exploring the arc\u2019s setting with an appropriate air of mystery; but when it\u2019s not doing that, the viewers are left seeing the characters interact with one another as they do what they have to do. And this usually means seeing Ai being what she is: a loli. I personally have nothing against these segments, but there are those who find Ai annoying as a character and the things she does ridiculous; and certainly there is merit to that view. Not only that, but the show shifts from serious to comedic in tone to accompany Ai\u2019s loli acts, and sometimes the change is so jarring it\u2019s simply not welcome. But since Kami-inai always remedies these annoyances with the emotional parts that follow afterward, they\u2019re not really that much of a problem.\\n\\n\r\nFor all the good that Kami-inai does with its emotional scenes, the said scenes are unfortunately also used at times to cover up gaping plot holes at the end of each arc. Or maybe it\u2019d be better to say that gaping plot holes exist where the writers decided to kick reason to the curb in favour of writing scenes that would make viewers cry, for maximum audience appeal; and of course, this has the neat upshot of making said viewers less likely to notice the plot holes. If you\u2019re the sort of person who can\u2019t stand a shoddily-made plot then you won\u2019t like it when it happens; but thankfully, there is only one real plot hole in the series. So it\u2019s not so bad.\\n\\n\r\nI realise I\u2019ve been praising the arc structure quite a bit in this review. Once you get over the idea that there is no single plot connecting the stories, Kami-inai\u2019s structure actually makes for a pretty good meta-plot, because each arc is as a consequence sharply focused, with zero filler. But that\u2019s within the arcs. So it kind of sucks when the third arc, episodes 7 and 8, is total filler; and what makes it even worse is that characters who are carried over to the next arc are developed here, so you can\u2019t just skip it and move on. You can\u2019t just blame Madhouse for it either \u2013 believe me, I wanted to \u2013 because they were just faithfully adapting volume 3 of the light novel series.  They actually cut it shorter than a standard three-episode arc; but even so, those two episodes alone take Kami-inai and drag it down from something amazing into something merely great.\\n\\n\r\nNow enough of the plot. Kami-inai is a beautifully drawn and animated series; my only complaint is the slight overuse of CGI in the early few episodes, not because they look bad but simply because they don\u2019t fit in with the rest of the animation. But CGI usage peters out beyond those two or three episodes, so it\u2019s not really a problem. The art is bright and colourful, with a slight fantastical tint that sets the world apart from the normal world (or what passes for it in anime); and while the art style sometimes has the characters looking a little flat when viewed front-on, they\u2019re still very detailed and very well drawn. Light and shadow is also used very well, often to great dramatic effect. Simply put, Kami-inai is beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it\u2019s not just easy on the eyes, too. The music is awesome, creating with ease the spooky, mysterious, and heartrendingly beautiful atmospheres that pervade the show. A lot of the emotional impact (and not just the crying scenes) is built on the background music, which should give you an idea of how good they are. Acting, for Ai and her main supporting cast, is consistently good, and all the characters come off as real and believable. And of course, mention must be made to the OP and ED songs, respectively \u2018Birth\u2019, sung by Kitamura Eri, and \u2018Owaranai Melody wo Utaidashimashita.\u2019, sung by Komatsu Mikako (yes, I\u2019m writing the names inverted by English rules. Deal with it). The OP song is catchy and fun song to listen to, if standard JPop fare; but the ED\u2019s is downright amazing. By itself it contributes to a great deal of the emotional impact I mentioned earlier; and even better, Madhouse plays with its ED so that the song will start before the credits roll, and sometimes the whole ED is cut in favour of just letting the credits and song play across what\u2019s going on \u2013 and the emotional impact of those moments is then magnified, pardon my exaggeration, a few hundredfold. It should say a great deal that while I really looked forward to the start of the episode when it aired every Sunday, I looked forward to the end even more.\\n\\n\r\nSo there you have it. If you want good plot Kami-inai\u2019s got it. If you want good setting Kami-inai\u2019s got it, and by the bucketloads. If you want themes Kami-inai\u2019s got it. If you want good characters Kami-inai\u2019s aren\u2019t half bad. And if you want good music Kami-inai\u2019s is damn amazing. So if you\u2019ve haven\u2019t watched this series before or quit at the start because of how stupid it seemed, keep watching and get past the show\u2019s deceptive shallowness to reach the wealth of greatness it has to offer. It\u2019s well worth it.\\n",

And as a show involved with helping various character find peace in order to move on, it can get very emotional.\r\nThe pacing for the most part is very good, following 4 mostly self contained arcs over the course of 3 episodes. The arcs are mostly character driven, delving into aspects ofhow society would react to this change in the world.\\n\r\nSome parts of the story however can feel rushed and skimmed over and while the ending was very enjoyable and satisfying, it does leave a lot of the world unexplored and questions unanswered. Episodes 7-9 felt particularly weak in comparison to the rest of the series to me. However the other three arcs were really strong.\\n\r\nIf I had to explain it in one sentence I would say that it's like a cross between the best parts of Angel Beats and Torchwood: Miracle Day.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art is lovely and consistent throughout. There are certain moments (and hopefully without spoiling too much) that happen when the 'dead' are put to rest which are wonderfully beautiful and very much enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nFor me, nothing really stood out too much. However that was partly due to the music matching the gentle and relaxing tone of the anime. It didn't need to stand out and it did its job. It just wasn't memorable. The opening however was very much enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThis is where the show stands out. Being a mainly character driven show it's understandable that most of the effort is expended in making the characters three dimensional in order for the emotional conflict to affect the audience.\\n\r\nThe majority of the characters only remain for their three episode arc in which time we meet them, learn more about them, and grow to care for them. This is especially prominent in last arc. (I may have cried.)\\n\r\nThere are some flaws. Various characters (especially in the 3rd arc) are barely touched on or not touched on at all. And for me a certain character went through a change that seemed to happen too suddenly and with very little explanation. I feel like it could have been handled a lot better. But I understand that 12 episodes isn't much time to fit a lot into.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this. It was sweet and touching and made me cry. There were certain parts that I felt took too long or were glossed over but aside from that Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi was just a really nice series to experience.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nIt's good. It's got relly well done emotional scenes at times but at others there are issues glossed over that I felt could have had more attention paid to them. At 12 episodes long it's definitely worth watching.",

            "content": "A world in which nobody can be born, but nobody dies either. The only way somebody can truly die is by being buried by a Gravekeeper. All of this because God had abandoned the world on a Sunday. \r\nAn interesting concept, is what I thought to myself when I read about Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi (or simply \"Sunday Without God\") and I decided to watch it and I wasn't disappointed in the slightest. As always, let's start off with the story.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nThe story of Sunday Without God both starts and ends interestingly (I won't be spoiling anything). The story opens up with a twelve yearold Gravekeeper by the name of Ai, who takes over as the town's gravekeeper after her mother dies. Then two mysterious men show up and Ai gets caught up in a series of events, but she has a motive of her own: to save the world. As much as I loved this anime, the story starts off strong, but gets a bit weaker . I won't say why, you'll have to see for yourself. I'm not saying the ending was bad! But I won't say if it was good either to avoid spoiling. Despite this, I give the story a 7/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nThis being a very recent anime, it has impeccable artwork done on it. Art is always important to me when I watch anime, and Sunday Without God did not disappoint. The second I laid eyes on it, I was simply amazed by how beautiful it went, and how well the art complemented the story.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nNo problem with the sound. It was brilliant. Not much to say.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nThere is no doubt in my mind that Sunday Without God has characters in it that you grow attached to. There are characters in this anime that you will love, and perhaps for no reason at all. Many characters I found myself loving the second I laid eyes on them. There are no characters that just act so antagonistic that you can't help but hate them; every character is loveable in some way or another.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nOften I find myself zoning out when I watch anime. However this isn't an issue when it comes to watching Sunday Without God. From the very get-go I couldn't get myself to stop paying attention. Yeah, sure, this anime doesn't have a plot that goes throughout the entire twelve episodes, but it has several smaller ones, each more interesting than the last.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nI give this anime an overall rating of 7. Why 7 and not 9 or 10 after I spoke so highly of it? Well, this anime surely has its positives: Outstanding artwork, amazing characters and a very interesting idea for the overall story. However, I have to mark it down as I was expecting it to stick more to the idea of people not being born anymore, and people dying but not actually dying until being buried by a Gravekeeper. At times it seems like they threw the idea out the window. They didn't, of course. It just didn't seem very important at times. I know you can't have the same bland crap being thrown at you every minute of every episode, but I don't feel as though there was enough of it in there.\\n\\n\r\nMy final verdict is: give this anime a try! Hopefully you will love it like I did.",

            "content": "Starting notice: a sudden desire urged me to try a different kind of review. So the following stream of words consists of two completely separate reviews, segregated by The Wall. Read it your way and enjoy it, for this is the main reason I guided some additional trains of thought through my brain.\r\n\"The world is no longer the same it was.\"\r\nSo, I immerged again... right into a new anime world going by the meaningful name of \"Sunday Without God\". Yes, God has literally left this world, bereaving humanity of its most essential abilities, namely giving birth and dying for good. In order to prevent thebodies of people who would actually die, but cannot anymore, from rotting away, the so called gravekeepers are capable to grant them their final rest. \\n\r\nAnd one of these gravekeepers is Ai, a 12-year-old, slightly spoiled girl who doesn't know anything of the world outside her calm home village. But suddenly, by some unfortunate coincidences, she is forced to leave her self-built cage of quietness and has to enter a world unbeknownst to her. \\n\\n\r\nGetting in contact with other peculiar characters trying to come through life without a god, not much time flows by before she has to deal with important questions like: How can this world be saved from its fate? Is dying actually that bad after we know it has been taken from us? What does it really mean, being a gravekeeper? Or how can I let my comrades remember the positive side of life?\\n\r\nThe last point mentioned leads me to Ai's personality. Somehow she reminds me of Taiga from Toradora with her looks, and so I initially thought of a more tsunderish behaviour to be seen. Nope, Ai starts pretty girlish, a bit impulsive, but stays calm enough, and the life in the village made her naive against more complex things. And then, as the anime advances, especially since it is only 12 episodes long, I really have to compliment how firm and diversified she becomes towards the end. I don't use this word often, but I have to admit that, all in all, Ai is just cute in both her appearance and her behaviour. \\n\r\nThe other characters are all likeable enough. They don't experience the same kind of development as Ai, but have their stories to tell and sometimes mentionable traits to reveal. You certainly won't get bored by them.\\n\\n\r\nA last mention on the main story. It doesn't meet a final or conclusive end, so maybe you will be a bit displeased. But you know, there is always the possibility to read the novel, which I actually haven't read, but certainly it contains satisfying answers to your remaining questions.\\n\\n\r\nArt- and soundwise actually only one word is needed: Enchanting.\\n\r\nTo give some more annotations for the detail-loving ones: Since quite a few scenes happen during dawn or dusk, oftentimes this 'yellow' prevailing mood is conveyed. And this is accompanied by astoundingly stunning light and shadow effects. The enchanting soundtrack gets noticed and varies to suit the special mood without a God. Animation is fluid and has some awesome 3D-rides in store, showing up even in the opening. Now that I mention it, both opening and ending are beautiful and nearly melancholic for me now. They won't get boring too soon like so many other ones. \\n\\n\r\n\"Each of us sees a different world.\"\\n\r\nSo, these words are optimal to impart my final thoughts. This series turned out as an unexpected fabulous tale, and so, in case you relish anime with an enchanting atmosphere, an adorable girl as lead character and themes like dealing with the dead, then for God's sake, watch it. And even if you see the world in a different way than me, you still have to assert that this show is a million times better than the crap today's television mainly provides. Deem these 12 episodes as a present to fulfil your life.\\n\\n\r\n____________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\n____________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\n____________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnother day without the God...\\n\r\nWhy did he leave a world so torn?\\n\r\nThe dead walk on, are left to rot\\n\r\nand human life cannot be born.\\n\\n\r\nSo gravekeepers are bound to give\\n\r\nthe walking dead a gentle fall.\\n\r\nWe follow Ai who strives to live,\\n\r\nto save the world, to save them all.\\n\\n\r\nBeginning as a naive child\\n\r\nwho doesn't know the world outside.\\n\r\nDevelops firm and inner wild\\n\r\nand lets the better thoughts abide.\\n\\n\r\nDiscovering peculiar guys,\\n\r\nthe dead's country or even school,\\n\r\nreceiving words pensive and wise,\\n\r\nshe slowly learns the keepers' rule.\\n\\n\r\nIn colours mystical and bright\\n\r\nthe world illuminates its thoughts.\\n\r\nWith stunning shadow-use and light\\n\r\nthe people rise above their hearts.\\n\\n\r\nThe music part is not just bound\\n\r\nto great open and ending themes.\\n\r\nSince life and death itself far sound,\\n\r\nthe world is tangible, it seems.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the story doesn't meet\\n\r\nhigh standards or a final end.\\n\r\nEnjoyment smoothly plants its seed,\\n\r\nand I stayed with it where it went.\\n\\n\r\nSo when the tension falls and grows,\\n\r\nyou have to feel and to endure.\\n\r\nBeside some mainstream actions shows\\n\r\nthis is a jewel, that's for sure!\\n",

            "content": "Sunday Without God is one of those animes I watch and I am like, \"How would it be if this actually happened.\" What if this world was one without death, birth or true life in general.\r\nStory 6/10\r\nThe initial story, in a world where god abandoned it may sound really interesting but as far as the anime went it didn't feel like they really touched on the topic that much. It was more about the adventure about the young grave keeper Ai. It is as short anime so it is hard to develop a great story but ehh, it could have been expanded upon much more.\r\nArt9/10\\n\r\nIt is by far one of the more artistic looking animes I have seen. Though its style does not really fit in with the tone of the anime. The anime has a morbid and touchy topic story so you would think think it would look a little darker than what it is.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\r\nI  watched this dub and may rewatch in sub but I gotta say I loved every bit of  sound and voice in this anime especially Ai, she has the most adorable voice in this series. Opening gets you pumped to watch this anime and the credits make such a good closer to any episode. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10\\n\r\nCharacters in this anime seem to have a straight forward personality and beliefs but I feel there is no real character development.  However thats not to say I didn't like any of them. Ai yet again takes the cake here. She is so adorable in every way.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10\\n\r\nI find Sunday Without God to be a really good anime. Its cute but yet very extreme with an usual story. I would definitely watch this anime if you enjoy stories about parallel universes from our own you should definitely watch this anime. Now if you aren't really interested after a couple of episodes I highly recommend sticking around to the end. The final few episodes are very enjoyable to watch and feel very deep. However the ending did leave me with questions on what actually happened.  It such a cliff hanger. But such good anime overall",

            "content": "\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have wishes,\u201d when Alis Color mentioned something like this, at first I didn\u2019t understand. What\u2019s wrong with having wishes? But after his reasoning was explained in a later episode, I realized the meaning of those words. Actually, it was at that point I finally realised what this anime was all about. Working hard to make your dreams come true, is what makes life interesting, right? To find the reason why I say this, you should watch Kamisama no Inai Nichyoubi for yourself.\r\nKamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi or Sunday Without God is set in a world where God abandoned the world 15 years agoon Sunday. The result is a world where nobody dies. This \u2018eternal life\u2019 has it\u2019s consequences: people can\u2019t reproduce and the only way to die peacefully is to be burried by a so-called Gravekeeper. Ai Austin is a young girl raised in a beautiful village, when a man called Hampnie Hambert appears before her, who claims to be a \u2018man-eating toy\u2019 and of who her deceased mother once told about. A sudden turn of events takes place, which changes the peaceful life Ai has been living until now. After her village is destroyed, Ai is destined to travel the vast, unknown world in a quest to save it. But saving the world with people who all look differently at this world, and is filled with dilemmas, isn\u2019t easy. The somewhat heavy themes and dilemmas make this story very interesting. The storytelling is great and as we follow Ai, who knows equally as much as we do (let\u2019s say nothing) about this world, we discover more and more about the world. And when you think you know the situation, it appears something completely different. With each problem solved, more questions arise. The great plottwist and mysteries make this a thrilling show, and each episode you wonder what will happen next.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this anime is brilliant. Beautiful colors, detailed surroundings and lovely characterdesigns. The animation looks fluent and great camerawork that makes the more intense scenes really stand out. The soundtrack accompanying the scenes is great as well and gives the show the right atmosphere, from heartwarming to emotional moments. I loved both opening and ending, and the voices fit really well with the characters. I have nothing more to say about this.\\n\\n\r\nThe heroine Ai Austin is a lovely, but na\u00efve girl and her reactions seem a bit stupid sometimes, but if you think about the way she is raised until recently, it\u2019s completely understandable. Her being bewildered by the new experiences, wanting to save everyone even though that\u2019s impossible and pondering over the dilemma\u2019s what everyone would do\u2026everything makes sense. Her character development is slow, but the subtle changes are there. The other character\u2019s thoughts and reasonings are well explored too and that makes them realistic. Their backgrounds are often sad and I have shed some tears over them during the show.\\n\\n\r\nI like this kind of anime really quickly. Maybe it\u2019s a bit singleminded, but I consider this a masterpiece, simply because it touches a sensitive chord in me and that\u2019s very important when I watch or read a story. After every episode I kept wondering about the situation, and tried to find my own answer to the vital questions popping up while watching the show. The ending solved the issues well, making me tearful (yes, I cry very easily) but satisfied. Yet there are many questions left unanswered and I hope there will be some answers in the 13th episode which will air later, or hopefully in a sequel. I loved Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi very much!\\n\\n\r\nI hope you\u2019re all working hard to reach your goals, because that\u2019s the only way to make your dreams become reality. And live your life to the fullest to be happy, rather than to wish for an eternal life.\\n",

She was kawai~ and Clumsy and klutzy and kirei-desu. I mean she was so strong and determined that I loved her.The characters Like Scar, Humpmei Hambart, Yuuki, Alice are the only ones i could remember the others did not leave much of an impression.Even we did not get to see much of these characters...I mean I would not mind having given some past of these characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment [9/10]:\\n\r\nHaving some flaws this anime was the best anime choice that I made at random. I enjoyed watching every moment of it.It was heart warming and easy perceptions story.There were fair amount of friendship and love.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL [8/10]:\\n\r\nOverall I loved this anime.The art animation, characters, story and a fair amount of romance made this anime of the good ones for me.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend you try this anime.

            "content": "What would you do is one day God abandoned the world and made it so that birth and death no longer existed? No longer would you age or have babies. The only thing waiting was eternal life, even if you never wished for it. Then, one day, people called Gravekeepers come to bury those who have died, making death an option again, but also making it harder for those who wants eternal life. That is Sunday Without God. \r\nOkay, let's get down to business. The story of Sunday Without is very interesting to say the least. It's original, exciting and just full on fascinating. Wefollow a young Gravekeeper called Ai on her journey to see the world. Along the way she meets many different characters who each have a role they must play in order to live. This story had me from the beginning. It felt like nothing I had seen before, and held me very interested. Though we follow Ai on her journey, there are many smaller stories within the big picture. This is where the story gets a little bumpier. It starts mixing in more and more supernatural elements without really explaining them at all. They're just there. There are also times when I thought they could've removed some parts in favor for explanation. Sometimes it tries to have a more everyday life part of it that didn't really fit the story, and it puts the whole finding out about the world thing to the side, which is a shame. We end up getting little to no explanation as to why God left, why supernatural elements are showing up or anything else for that matter. The story started out with so much potential, but falls a little flat in the end. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are a big part of what drives this story along. Most of them have unique personalities and are very likable, though most of them do not get as much screen time or development as I had wished for, but that is to be expected when the anime is only 12 episodes long. I'm only going to talk about three of the \"main\" characters that we see the most of in order to try to avoid as many spoilers as possible. \\n\r\nAi is our adorable main lead. She's a 12 year old Gravekeeper who had lost her mother and been raised by her village instead. She is the only known of her kind since the events of Sunday Without God happens over 12 years after God had left, therefore no child should be as young as she is. She is naive and unaware of how the world truly works, but she is also hard working, slightly spoiled, brave, stubborn and very kind. She's a fun character to follow, and you really grow to like her, though her spoiled nature and stubbornness can get a little annoying. She, sadly, does not get as much development as I would have wished for. She learns through the anime, but it doesn't really change her all that much. \\n\r\nThen we move on to Julie (male). He's a middle aged man who is out for revenge after his wife was killed and buried when he was out of the house one day. He becomes acquainted with Ai and grow a sort of family bond. He is very dependable, logical and good with a gun. Generally a pretty likable character, though he also does not get all that much development in the end. \\n\r\nThe last person I will talk about is Scar. She is a Gravekeeper who is vastly different from Ai, and more like how Gravekeepers should be. She has a mysterious scar across one of her eyebrows, and her main goal in life is burying the dead and helping mankind. She does not harbor any emotion, but smiles a lot in an almost robot like way. She is also the character that gets the most development oddly enough. She learns a lot from Ai and starts seeing the world differently from how she is \"programmed\" to. \\n\r\nThe side characters all get a decent amount of development and are fun to have around, though some of them are unnecessary or just there to move the plot along. The ones that are more important get a lot of screen time and shows change by the end of their arc. They are usually very unique and memorable, and they each serve a purpose in Ai's journey. \\n\r\nThere is also no actual villain in this anime. Though some of the stories has a bad person that our main protagonists has to fight against, they're pretty forgettable. In the end, their enemy is the world and, kind of, God. It's his fault the world is in the complete chaos that it's in, though he is not seen as a villain either. The anime doesn't really need a villain. It, instead, focuses on the mental challenges the characters had to go through, and that makes for many interesting stories. \\n\\n\r\nThe art in this show is stunningly beautiful. It often has a very red and orange or a black and purple layer to it and uses a lot of beautiful contrasts and sharp colors. The backgrounds are amazing and just beautiful to look at, and the design of the world is very beautiful. It had a lot of sunsets and shots of wide landscapes that are just gorgeous to look at. Since the characters are traveling we also get to see many different parts of the world and their contrasts to each other. The post apocalyptic scenery is stunning to look at and very well designed. \\n\r\nIt manages to tone down the more extreme colors when it wants the focus to be on the characters. It also has very pretty character designs where every character looks different from the others, mainly because of the wide use of hair and eye colors. They cleverly use clothes and different heights to make the character unique from each other, and it's easy to see when one person is from another city. \\n\r\nThe animation on the opening is very much like the rest of the anime, using beautiful contrasts and symbolism. \\n\r\nThe ending only pans downwards on a picture of the cast of the anime, and it is a very pretty picture, though it doesn't really do much to get you pumped for the next episode. \\n\\n\r\nMusic is always a big part of the anime. The soundtrack to this anime consists of mostly dark, ominous or calming pieces, often using piano, orchestra and choirs to make it sound more suspenseful. There are also some guitar tracks that are very nice to listen to. It is the perfect OST for when you want calming and atmospheric music. Though I wished there was more variation in the OST, what I got was still pretty good. \\n\r\nThe OP is called \"Birth\" by Eri Kitamura. It uses the wonderful trick of making the anime 50% more awesome just by the use of epic choirs, church bells and organ music. When it mixed together with a rock/pop band it becomes very beautiful and fits the anime very well. \\n\r\nThe ED is called \"Owaranai Melody wo Utaidashimashita (I Sang a Never Ending Melody)\" by Komatsu Mikako and is a calm song with mostly piano, though a slightly electronic band starts playing after a while. It uses some english and a fairly strong bass which gives it more energy. The music in this ED often starts playing before the episode is fully over, and it fits very well as background music. It's a calming and beautiful piece. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the heck out of this anime. I loved the world it was set in and really wanted to figure out its mysteries, which left me pretty disappointed when many of these mysteries were left unsolved. It should have had more episodes or a second season, because it definitely needs more explaining. I enjoyed the journey together with Ai and liked most of the story arcs and characters. Each story had a lot of good points and the story was, to a certain point, pretty unpredictable. And I would say it's worth watching just for the beautiful art style. \\n\\n\r\nOverall this was an anime with a lot of potential, though it fell a little flat in the end. There were parts I wished was done better, but what I got was very good and enjoyable. This is an anime for those of you who love a beautiful post apocalyptic setting with a fascinating premise and a cast of fun characters. You must like having several stories within a story and not mind that sometimes the main plot gets put aside for other things. You must also bear that Ai can be annoyingly stubborn and naive, despite her adorableness. If you don't mind this, then you're in for a fascinating and beautiful road trip through a very mysterious world.",

            "content": "Just when I thought fantasy animes couldn\u2019t come up with an original story, I was mistaken. I started this series without any expectations but somehow, I already had the idea that I won\u2019t be taken by surprise. Apparently, Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi isn\u2019t one to play things like others do and I believe it deserves a better reception than it has.\r\n\tIt may not seem like it from the surface, but the story is quite deep to a certain level. Not only is it complex, but it did as much as to influence my perspective in life. Simply said, the story is rich in ideas andphilosophies. The progression is flawless considering that three unique plots transitioned smoothly between each other for a length of twelve episodes. Events happened in a quick pace and some minor details that would have otherwise clarified everything else were skipped but they\u2019re not necessarily rushed. I was also amazed by how each arc presented a totally new story without compromising the delivery. In addition, nothing is uninteresting and unengaging. \\n\\n\r\n\tOn the other hand, the characters were very likeable despite how I found them to be nearly common as to the rest. Nevertheless, in a short span of time, I became fond of the main character\u2019s qualities of kindness, innocence, and courage. The other supporting characters felt close too. It was also surprising how a lot of characters played important roles and greatly contributed to the development of the series.\\n\\n\r\n\tNot only was the story made well but as well as the overall art. The visuals consisted of stunning sceneries that is shown even from the very first episode. The music used were perfect and did well to amplify the emotions intended. The ending theme was my favorite and I love how it starts to play at the last scenes of the episode before entering the credits. \\n\\n\r\n\tTo sum up, everything from the anime is enjoyable \u2013 the story, mystery, conclusions, music, art and appealing characters. The only problem I found with the anime is that I wasn\u2019t fully satisfied with all of it that I\u2019m wanting for more because unfortunately, the anime is too short. It\u2019s a good thing that even though I only enjoyed it for a short while, it\u2019s still a memorable one. Whenever you decide that you to experience the entertainment of fantasy as if it was your first time, then give Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi a try!\\n\\n",

            "content": "The Sunday Without God is a fantasy type anime that follows Ai Astin, a grave keeper tasked to putting the dead to rest. However, her world is changed when she meets a man named Hampnie.\r\nThe anime is set in a world where God has abandoned the world and as such no one can reproduce or fully die. That is, unless a grave keeper puts them to rest. To be clear, people die but become... undead. As they lose their humanity they change into what could be seen more as zombies. However, the undead can live normal lives. If you are wondering, yes it does soundmuch like Dark Souls.\\n\\n\r\nProbably the most impressive thing the show does is world building. Almost every reveal or aspect of the world that is being built is interesting and adds extra layers to the characters and themes.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I will say is that the first half of the show is much more compelling than second. While a lot of the strengths of the world building and such are still there, the story archs are just not as interesting as the more philosophical elements are not as present later on. It might have to do also that the later episodes seem a lot more cliche and just toss a ton of characters at us instead of focusing on a couple.\\n\\n\r\nIt's interesting that Ai is really the only character I would call a main. She is extremely naive and self-righteous about things. To the point where she can become annoying. Each anime arch she meets characters that not only reveal aspects of the world to her but also new ideas that she has not thought about before.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is Ai's journey, and as such she has to move on from place to place. This causes some things to feel incomplete. The ending itself feels like a cop out, but is understandable. Surprisingly, some of the characters specific to each arch get more development than the more permanent side characters. There are also some instances where important plot points are not explained (mostly for sake of time.)\\n\\n\r\nThe art is stunning. Everything is well detailed and the use of shading and lighting are especially well done. The show is dark when it has to be dark and bright when it needs to be bright. The sound is also pretty good. While not as noticeable as the lighting the bgms are usually well placed and well chosen. Personally I think the OP and ED are good, but nothing to write home about.\\n\\n\r\nThe Sunday Without God has some amazing world building and the art quality to represent that. However, it seems like someone abandoned the show half way through as it turns into a bit of a mess of characters and unexplained plot.",

            "content": "EPIC. This has been added to my top animes. An anime has never drawn out so many emotions from me.\r\nSunday without God is set in a world where God has suposedly abandoned the world and has granted humans a life on Earth as a dead person. The only people who can bury the dead and put them to rest are gravekeepers. \r\nThis is basically about a 12 year old girl named Ai. She takes on her mother's role of being a gravekeeper after her mother's death. Ai takes it upon herself to save the world and goes through many calamities. \r\nStory 10/10 - I haveto say that the story was gold. It was so creative and enjoyable. Like most animes, I thought I could guess what would happen. Unlike most animes, I was completely wrong.\\n\r\nI felt like I died a little inside at the end of the 3rd episode, I have never become so attached to a character after just 3 episodes of any show. The ending was just EPIC. It threw me way off and I literally jumped up screaming WHAT. I know a lot of people called it a troll ending but I thought it was something different.  \\n\r\nAnimation & music 10/10 - The OP and ED were very good and suited the anime. The background music, along with the angles used were so good, it pulled me right into the anime.\\n\r\nThe animation was really beautiful and crisp. The colours and tones used were perfect and during the sunsets, the yellow wash was magnificent. \\n\r\nIt suited the whole theme of no one being able to die because everyone looked roughly the same age to me, well that's how I interpreted it. \\n\r\nCharacters 9/10 - First up, I have to say that Ai is just so cute. She was such a lovable character. \\n\r\nI feel like I attached myself to the characters because after the death of a certain character (no spoilers), I  shatered. All the other characters, mains or supporting, were exceptional. The growth of the characters could be seen and that is very important in a good anime to me.\\n\r\nOverall, 10/10, I thoroughly enjoyed this anime and I really am looking forward to more. I actually cried during some scenes and I have to say that it's very hard to pull a 10 out of me. I am so drawn to this anime that I have taken it upon myself to read the manga.",

            "content": "Sunday Without God is a title set in a post-apocalyptic future where the concept of death no longer exists in the world as those who die are no longer able to pass on and those known as Gravekeepers are the only ones who have the ability to allow those among the undead to be put to rest. Ai is one of those Gravekeepers as she learns things in her small village home and a mysterious white-haired man are not as they seem on the surface, being connected to the unique phenomena that has plagued the world of this series.\r\nBefore I go on with this review,I would like to comment on this show's major weakness in that it doesn't really do much at addressing major elements to its world. It is never explained how the phenomena within Sunday Without God takes place or how particular people are able to gain supernatural powers, hence requiring viewers to accept things within the series at face value. It's essentially a major storytelling issue that one will have to overlook in order to get the most enjoyment out of this series possible.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on from this, Sunday Without God is focused on Ai journeying throughout the world of her series as she explores how others are affected by the concept of death no longer being within the world and acquiring companions throughout her journey that aid her. Most arcs in the series are meant to serve as an observation of how the societies and characters cope with lacking the ability to pass on, with a major element to this series being that those among the undead for prolonged periods of time can drive one to lose their sanity the longer they remain in the world. The Ortus arc addresses how undead within the series live in a society that they can integrate into without being rejected by those among the living, making for the best arc I seen within the series in its focus on what led so many undead to become part of this society. With its observational focus, the series maintains a neutral viewpoint with how viewers take in what they see through the majority of arcs and doesn't preach for one right or wrong viewpoint.\\n\\n\r\nThe only instance a right and wrong viewpoint comes up is during the events of the Goran Academy arc which does cause the series quality to dip to a degree at this point of the series. Beyond this, the only other weaknesses I can remark on with Sunday Without God are that there were some points where I felt there may have been pandering to the audience employed with moments revolving around Ai's naivette and cuteness, as well as the fact that the series lacks a proper ending since the journey of Ai and her companions continues beyond the end of the series as its light novel source material was still ongoing as of the end of the TV anime.\\n\\n\r\nGripes aside regarding aspects to its storytelling, Sunday Without God is still a solid drama title delving into a world that explores how people handle the idea that they can not pass on once they die and focusing on the companions that Ai gains throughout her journey to better understand the world. It's at least worth a look if you like seeing anime that attempt to tell a worthwhile story without being too pretentious over how it tells it.",

            "content": "In a world abandoned by God, where people have stopped giving birth and cannot die, there are certain humans called \"Gravekeepers\" who have the ability to bury the walking corpses that cannot die, and put them to rest. 12 year old Ai Astin is the last child born in the world and is one of those Gravekeepers. Thrust into the role at a young age when her Gravekeeper mother passed away, she has a tough task ahead of her, as she goes on a journey to save the mankind that God abandoned. \"Sunday Without God\" (Kaminai) is a 12 episode anime series done by StudioMadhouse and directed by Yuji Kumazawa.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 7/10\\n\r\nThe story of Kaminai is split up into 5 arcs where Ai meets many new people and tries her best to help them out in any way she can. Now, Kaminai is one of the perfect examples of an anime with a high production value without a great story to back it up. The PREMISE is really good and unique in my opinion. But it just isn't handled well. I like when episodic shows split up their stories into arcs (like Mononoke) because it gives you much more time to explain and get your plot out there. But Kaminai doesn't do it well. They spend a lot of time doing nothing and then by the end the problem is usually resolved.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 6/10\\n\r\nAi is pretty much the one mainstay character in the series. You've also got the recurring characters like Julie and Scar. Ai is uh....well she's not entirely useless. She is half Gravekeeper half human. And she's one of the more F**KING ADORABLE characters I've seen in recent anime. Her and her little hat and shovel :) But that's about all I have to say about her.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nART: 9/10\\n\r\nThe animators at Madhouse are known for being damn good at their jobs. As I said before, this anime has a very high production value. The background art looks stunningly beautiful at times and I adore the character designs. If you watch this just for its amazing visuals, you will not be disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 8/10\u00a0\\n\r\nThe music is very very soothing and just nice to listen to. The music was composed by Hiromi Mizutani who has done the music for shows like Hell Girl and Non Non Biyori. I was fine with the opening theme but THE ENDING THEME IS MAGNIFICENT. It's one of those songs that just gives me chills and brings emotion out of me. If you don't watch this anime, at least listen to this song.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 7/10\\n\r\nOVERALL: 7/10\\n\r\nFINAL THOUGHTS:\\n\r\nSunday Without God is a good anime. It is not bad but it's not great. I personally feel that it is unfinished and needs a 2nd season. The anime has more problems than good things about it, like it's characters, the pacing, and how the story was handled. However, if your looking for an anime with GREAT production value and a very nice soundtrack, look no further than Sunday Without God.\\n\r\nBut...no rush...really\\n\\n\r\nPOSITIVES: \\n\r\n-Very detailed animation by Madhouse\\n\r\n-Soothing soundtrack\\n\r\n-Somewhat sad and depressing arcs (if your into that)\\n\r\n-Mysterious story and characters\\n\r\n-Very good final arc\\n\\n\r\nNEGATIVES:\\n\r\n-Story is not entirely well done\\n\r\n-Left with too many unanswered questions\\n\r\n-Characters backstories are not well explained\\n\r\n-Unfinished plot\\n\\n\r\nSee ya soon.",

            "content": "Wow, where to start? Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi, when it was announced that an anime adaption was being developed, I looked at the trailer, and really, I thought I wouldn't be watching this, the PV didn't speak out to me, but the topic was interesting. So when it started airing, I decided to give it a try. And boy, was I surprised. Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi offers a great story, the art is just the best I have ever seen, and the OST and music, gorgeous.\r\nBy episode 3, I was completely engrossed in Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi and found myself become a complete fanatic overthis series. It was amazing and breathtaking. Trust me, this anime WILL make you cry tears of sorrow and happiness. The story, I don't even know how someone could come up with this GOD-LIKE story. It is just so original and just memorizing. Also one notable thing, the ending son, \"Begun to Sing an Endless Melody,\" just plays during the ending of each episode at THE PERFECT moment, no joke, 100% spot on. Each episode was a cliffhanger, ESPECIALLY Episode 12, oh boy, could they progress into a whole season with just that, and hopefully they do!\\n\\n\r\nSince it is in my nature to name one bad thing about ALL animes, even this anime, which was like now tied with my number one anime, I have to write something bad to present an unbiased review. The only bad thing I would have to say about this anime is that after episode 6, or whenever the Ai and her accomplices leave Ortus, the city of the dead, the plot kind of strayed off a LITTLE bit. And by this, it kind of started getting bland, but then it quickly recovered, so DO NOT FEAR! \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime is amazing, definitely deserves another season with the cliffhanger at the end, is now tied with my number one anime of all time, will make you cry tears of sorrow and happiness, and I, DEFINITELY recommend you to freak'n watch this GOD-LIKE Masterpiece. So what are you doing reading this review, GET WATCHING! :D",

            "content": "Sign, that was beautiful, totally a very nice drama fantasy, so I'm not gonna f*** around and just present my ratings for this anime:\r\nStory: fair 6.\r\nI kinda like the drama fantasy thing that this 12 episode anime presents, but I find it hard to accept the concept of God abandoning the world, and the people of the world stopped giving birth and the dead becomes zombies that still functions like human and have to be brought down by grave keepers, let's face the story's logic really does contradict  itself, In reality if God were abandons the world, then the end result is Armageddon. Butin this anime/manga, the said God here is presented  as this lazy landlord who just lets his grave keepers do the dirty-work and doesn't give a thing as to how things turns up. However, the drama supernatural fantasy is focus on Ai as she goes to one adventure to another, let's face it this anime is compose of 4 adventures that ranges from Ai being with Hampire Hamberg, to Ai being in the city of Ortus, to the great escape from Goran Academy and the mystery of the class of 3-4 in Ostia, and I did like the the end drama where such ending was very touching, but I limit it to such score since one shouldn't ignore this anime's contradicting paradigm.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Poor 3.\\n\\n\r\nAside from the huge heads and slim body that were ill proportioned , I'm a bit disappointed that there isn't much of fanservice around it.   \\n\\n\r\nSound:   Mediocre 6.\\n\\n\r\nSince there isn't anything for me to comment about it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Fair 6.\\n\\n\r\nOk, this anime is all about Ai the half human half gravekeeper in fact this anime's 4 part adventure usually composes of various support characters whom are part of each adventure. So I'm just gonna focus on her, I like her sweet and caring characteristics, but I'm a bit annoyed by her being this naive    and being too caring attitude that she really doesn't leave anybody behind even at the risk of the majority, also I'm a bit disappointed that this anime totally places Scar and  Julie Sakuma Dmitriyevich as  thirdier characters, thought the two looks good being together, anime director  Y\u016bji Kumazawa could have properly utilize their character to add more to this anime fantasy. genre.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: good 7.\\n\\n\r\nIn spite of this anime's contradicting paradigm, it was still enjoyable enough to be viewed as a fantasy drama as the main character Ai goes from one adventure to the next with different support characters and that's that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: good 7.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it's good since every adventure of this anime has do have a happy ending and that's as good as it gets.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAdios muchachos.\\n\\n",

            "content": "For an anime that treats the disappearance of God in the world, it certainly seems so figuratively speaking, because \"Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi\" or in its english title \"The Sunday without a God\" it looks like God decided to leave this anime to its fate after a few episodes, and it didn't develop in a satisfying manner. This is because it started with an alluring premise, yet failed miserably in its progression, deviating from its original storyline, alongside with an uninteresting heroine.\r\n~Story~\r\nThe story if the anime is centered around Ai, a 12-year-old girl who is a gravekeeper despite her young age. While it may soundsimple, there is a gist to it: God left the world to its own fate, where people are neither born or die. This is the reason of the presence of these gravekeepers, the only people capable of putting people to rest by of course burying them. For little Ai this isn't something she is aware of, until a mysterious man by the name of Hampnie Hambart, who happens to have the same name as her unknown father, murders the entire village. Why did this happen? \\n\\n\r\nThe premise of Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi is in fact very intriguing, presenting audiences with a topic that makes them ponder about the events to come in case the world was in fact controlled by God. The immortality of its habitants certainly questions the cons and pros of immortality, in addition to shaping the world after the disappearance of God. In most cases, these took an interesting development and certainly enhanced its premise. The anime also dedicates to introducing several elements concerning the state of affairs, which resulted in more questions. In fact, it is a world shrouded in mystery - which doesn't get revealed to the viewers in most cases. This is where the many issues with this anime begin.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, the fact that there are more questions than answers throughout its duration was a drawback, as these were left for the viewer to think about. This is not bad on its own, yet there were too many mysteries as well as unresolved conflicts and thematic issues to ignore these. However, the biggest gripe with the anime was its change in the direction of its story: from presenting the world, its people and its alluring theme, it steers to be a slice of life focused on its protagonist, albeit treating at times superficially its topic. This felt redundant to the story, especially considering its premise.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem with the slice of life part, which incidentally spans the majority of the anime, is that it is as a whole uninteresting. Rather than using it for character development, it is used for the introduction of several characters and unnecessary events tied to these, such as Ai being kidnapped to go to school. In addition, besides the supernatural powers of the gravekeepers, more are introduced which felt redundant for the story as whole, being hardly ever expanded on. The abundance of plot convenient twists was also a huge drawback, especially its disappointing conclusion: it basically left viewers thinking that all the previous events were rendered useless - especially the explanation on God's disappearance. Speaking of the conclusion, it is left open.\\n\\n\r\n~Characters~\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the cast of characters of Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi, it was small as a whole, yet sufficiently large for its story. The protagonist Ai is a typical protagonist who is caring with high moral standards, yet at the same time insecure at times due to her young age and her situation. She undergoes certain character development, although not huge, tied with some fleshing out. Yet as a character she is uninteresting as she is too perfect for a 12-year-old, in addition to all the interactions with adults she encounters. Every single one of them immediately follows, praises or embraces her for no convincing reason, which is the reason she comes over as a spoiled brat.\\n\\n\r\nThere also other characters of importance, such as Alice: he is incidentally one of the characters who contributes to the female lead. He is as a character interesting with a convincing motive, which certainly adds to the story. The problem is that his personality is generic as well his motive. Other character of importance is Dee Ensy, a fellow gravekeeper, as she gives insight onto its world, undergoing a bit of character development.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the other characters remain underdeveloped and unexplored, which is a shame, as some were certainly of interest. Leaving these aside, I was personally much more interested in the hardships of the people, suffering of what could be called the \"undead curse\". These were in fact portrayed in a convincing manner, yet was not really expanded on. As a whole, the characters were rather lackluster, which could be due to the fact of its time limits.\\n\\n\r\n~Animation and sound~\\n\\n\r\nThe art style of the anime was certainly a positive aspect, as these was presented with well drawn backgrounds as well as having a diverse environment. The character's design were generic, yet colourful and distinguishable. As for the animation quality, this was well done and matched with the diverse scenes the anime was portraying.\\n\\n\r\nThe music score of the anime was befitting as whole for the anime, with some pleasant compositions, yet forgettable, which could be said about its openings and endings as well. The voice actors performed their roles well, conveying the different emotional states of the characters in a convincing manner, yet at times a bit exaggerated for my liking.\\n\\n\r\n~Enjoyment~\\n\\n\r\nKamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi was ultimately a very lackluster anime which main culprit was its change in direction of its story, in addition to the unsatisfying open conclusion. The characters were for most part uninteresting and underdeveloped, its art style and soundtrack, as well as its premise the redeeming aspects of the anime. I honestly do not recommend this anime to anyone, unless viewers wouldn't mind the afore-mentioned issues. I am well aware that for some these wouldn't be an issue, yet personally I found it to be unacceptable as whole.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading.",

            "content": "How can we truly perceive the world around us? The answer is: we can't. It's impossible for a human being to understand what is actually going on around him, because what he really sees is just what his brain interprets. Everyday people make new discoveries, everyday another person comes to realize something new about themselves and the world he is surrounded by, but we aren't getting any closer to understanding the questions that have been bugging us since the beginning of humanity's development. However, all that would never be possible in the first place, if we didn't set goals for ourselves, if we didn't dreamabout something bigger, something better, something that we more than likely won't ever reach through any normal means. Even if we know that some things are completely out of our reach at that exact point in time, we still wish for those things. That's what defines humanity. And this is a show about setting those goals, followed by the never ending search of any means to reach them, and completing small objectives on the road that it takes us. One of those goals might just be saving the world, another one could be understanding it.\\n\r\nLadies and gentlemen - Sunday without God, a series that while being seriously flawed at some moments, was able to provide ME with a tale that I could fully comprehend from the beginning to the ending, and one that was able to achieve one of those normally unachievable goals it set in front of itself. That goal was pretty simple: give the viewer a freedom of interpretation and understanding this story in his own way, while still providing enough entertainment, plot twists and philosophical questions to make him think about it for days.\\n\r\nIncredibly simple right? (*Sarcasm alert*)\\n\\n\r\nI will be referring to this series either by \"Kamisama\", \"Sunday without God\" or \"Kaminai\" throughout this review.\\n\r\n*Incredibly slight spoilers inside*\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nSunday without God constantly brings something special to the table, with an unique premise, setting, and ideas at every new step. It is impossible to talk about the actual plot without spoiling a single thing, so instead of that, I want to talk about the appreciation I have for the care that the original creator put into his work.\\n\r\nKaminai is his first project, and throughout the show I could feel the passion that was put into the story. The light novel that it is based off of is his first work as an author, but it doesn't go as far as his later reimaginations. I'm pretty certain that the idea of the show just popped into his head one day, and he rolled with it, creating a story around it, adding additional characters and arcs that he then released in the form of a manga and later into an anime. I feel like this is the case because of the way that the story revolves around the main character, Ai, or more specifically, around the previously mentioned journey and the objectives she completes along the way. Each arc that I saw influences her way of thinking. She starts off by finding her dream, but the way in which she wants to do achieve it changes after more influential events. That's why her journey leads her to explore the world she lives in and understand the communities she encounters. Arc after arc, character after character I could witness completely different ways of utilizing the setting to its maximum, it wasn't afraid to ask hard hitting questions or propose unpopular ideas. The show itself never takes a stance and it never states that a way of dealing with the dilemmas that the characters face is correct or wrong. Everything is a gray area in a world without God, and I love it. Stories that give me the freedom of interpretation and don't throw its meaning at my face TOO often tend to be some of my favorites. And not only that, but the amount of options from which I could choose was pretty large. Let me put it like this: If I was to be put into that world, in the same time as the events of the anime take place, even knowing the entire plot I would still have to think hard about how to approach my way of living, about what side will I take in some conflicts and what goal would I set for myself. Not because there wasn't enough information provided, but because those dilemmas are so multisided, none of them are clean and easy answers.\\n\r\nI was also pleasantly surprised by how alive the world felt with all its emptiness. The characters often stumble upon someone in the middle of nowhere, the entire setting feels like its truly moving. Even when a group is left behind, the thought that they are going to live their lives somewhere in that world persisted. That could be contributed to the values that the main characters bring to that community. They aren't groundbreaking, but they're impactful, they don't change their ideals, but change their approach and so on.\\n\r\nIdeals can't make a good story though. What a show needs first and foremost, is a good structure: the pacing, progression and such. Several shows that I watched weren't able to overcome these basics, but aimed higher than most anime out there. Sunday without God thankfully does those things well. At no point is it stagnant, even in the more relaxed parts it is still able to be insightful. That's not to say that a show doesn't need moments that don't progress the story and instead build the connection between the viewer and the characters, but when you can mix them with small hints or make them have a strong message it makes them this much more memorable. Not only that, but It's also able to slow down or speed up the pace when it wants to. However, with all that being said....\\n\r\nEven if I do consider this to be one of my favorite anime stories, and even if I do consider most of the writing to be exceptional, I can't help but notice that this anime has a serious problem with reaching finales, at least in the first two arcs. This is another thing that leads me to believe that the author created everything around one idea. It seems like he really wanted to have a couple of specific elements included in his story, but didn't really know how to go about adding them  without breaking the flow. This may be the reason for some serious mistakes taking place. They prevent this part from being rated as a ten. One of the examples is including some characters with a supposed backstory, that we learn about only briefly, just so they can serve a purpose of being plot elements, without which some of the most touching and impactful scenes would have less meaning than they actually do. Is it a bad thing? Yes, of course it is. I don't think that a character thrown into my face as a plot element will be one that I'll remember fondly. Does it influence the story in a major way? No. It does influence the story, don't get me wrong, but not to the point where it breaks its flow or the overarching theme of the series. Since those two elements were the most important ones here, at least for me, I didn't think they were as bad as I normally would see them being.\\n\r\nAs for the ending, my train of thought leads to believe that it was all set up exactly the way it was supposed to. If you would disagree with me, I would definitely see where you're coming from. Yes, the ending leaves a lot to be desired, however it's meaning leaves me completely satisfied. It ends on the perfect point in the story, that, because of it's themes and direction, made chills run down my spine.\\n\r\nI like to think of myself as some sort of an advocate of people who find personal meaning in any piece of artistic work more important than the quality, that's because I went through that experience  as well. I, just like those people, am able to overlook several mistakes if they don't tarnish my experience. However, I don't think this is the reason why I thought the story deserves this much praise. I genuinely think it was masterfully created so that the viewer can find his own way of understanding it and possibly finding something about himself, something that he wouldn't be able to find otherwise. The means of achieving this goal are a bit shady at times, but I can't argue with the results. I have yet to find a better utilized post apocalyptic setting in anime, maybe even in any media.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6\\n\r\nUnlike the story, the characters aren't explored particularly well, and yet I somehow feel like it was done on purpose. The story itself relies heavily on symbols, there's not a single thing that holds no meaning or no value to its themes. Characters are no exception, they're symbols that represent ideas and viewpoints. For example, Ai, the main heroine, is a daughter of a gravekeeper and a human. She represents two different ideals that her parents carried and the hope for the destroyed world. She is probably the most developed and interesting character thanks to that. She constantly develops her mindset, every key event has an effect on her way of thinking, which leads to her getting lost at times.\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast serve exactly the same purpose. Humpnie is a representative of people who believe that the dead should stay dead, Ai's mother represents people who dream about creating heaven on Earth, Yuri is just a guy who tried to live happily in the situation he was placed in and Scar, as an usual Gravekeeper, is the carrier of the world's future. Not to mention the characters that pop in later.\\n\r\nActually, I think \"pop in\" is a good way of describing character introduction here. It just sort of happens, I never really felt like they did it properly. Some characters were also introduced just to disappear for the rest of the series. Despite that, the strongest asset of the cast is everything that happens with them after the introduction. They really feel well utilized and well implemented into the world and its topics. None feel repetitive, and while some are barely glanced over, others bring huge improvement and add even more psychological depth to it. That's why even though the series rarely expands on its rather large cast, I still feel like they all did their job fairly well.\\n\r\nTheir interaction at times feel more realistic than at others. There are groups and pairs that clearly have better chemistry, but because of that the rest feel like they're put aside for the sake of those shining brighter. It would be nice if they could  balance it out and create a more memorable cast, but it is what it is I guess.\\n\r\nI wouldn't say the show has a bad or forgettable cast, far from it, but I think that it's only because of their place in the story. I don't think I would care about them as much as I did on their own, or if they were a part of any other anime. Simply put, the story compliments the characters far more than the other way around. Kaminai is a heavy, story focused show, but that doesn't mean that it can be used as an excuse for some slightly, but noticeably, lacking characters.\\n\\n\r\nMusic and Visuals: 8,5\\n\r\nAnother strong aspect of the series is that it's set in France of all places. This leads to some pretty interesting choices in its music, world design and character designs. That's why I'm grouping the visuals and music together, they truly feel like a one big entity that is created solely for the purpose of setting the mood. Everything looks pretty different compared to other anime. The characters travel through grassy fields, mountain roads, small cities with gothic looking churches in them and even small castles, very smoothly on top of that. Their designs, while a bit over the top at times, with the bright colored hair, look solid and deviate from the usual anime norm. The music is often slow and ambient, but it can change depending on the situation. Everything does feel like it is set in destroyed Europe, which feels nice. We don't see this part of the world covered nearly enough in anime, or at least I don't.\\n\r\nThe directing isn't the best by no means, but it has its moments. It can do beautiful things if it wants to, some scenes can be meaningful and set up pretty well with some really well animated moments, and most of the time the music doesn't stay behind as well as it compliments both the place the scene is taking place at and its mood. It's a well coordinated show in that regard.\\n\r\nOn its own, the soundtrack is genuinely beautiful. It's calming and poignant, with some tracks like \"Blessing\" and \"Lost World\" creating some of the best atmosphere I've ever felt while listening to an anime OST. The opening and the ending songs really represent the way I felt about the series. They switch between a fast and a slow pace, use a lot sounds that make them feel magical and even tear jerking. They also always end on the slower part, just like the series did. The OP uses a choir that can be heard throughout its entirety, which does strengthen the feeling of the religious themes the show presents. The ED starts of really slow and later starts to bring in hopeful, louder sounds to, by the end of it, feel like it was always a happy song all along. Overall, it's a very well thought out soundtrack that really does strengthens the series.\\n\r\nSame could be said about the art work, or at least about the backgrounds. You could probably take half of the larger shots in this series and turn them into wallpapers, and while that's some truly outstanding work, the stuff that you see on the regular is \"only\" good. Comparing them to the prettier scenes in the series, they don't seem to receive the same amount of care. There's even some CGI involved, it's not that bad, but it shows that several compromises had to be made. Overall, I do think that the art style is good, and the animation is always fluid, but it's not perfect by no means.\\n\r\nSo, on the audiovisual side Kaminai is a spectacle to behold. It's able to look good, while still being able to present its symbols clearly and never being too pushy or pretentious about it the same time. I can truly appreciate that. To be honest this could be expected, Madhouse rarely disappoints in that regard.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nNowadays, any anime that tries to be thought inducing leaves me with a bit of a bad aftertaste. Either because of the themes not being utilized in a meaningful way, that would help the series be more than it was, or because of writing putting the characters into inhumane levels of profoundness, or because of the core and the basics are not good enough to even justify trying to achieve that. Kamisama doesn't do any of that. I felt the impact that the journey had on the characters without it ever feeling overly slow or overly fast. People over at Madhouse were able to create some of the its themes so well, that it got me thinking about it for days, both during and after the time I watched it. While being away from my computer screen I constantly think about this show and its story. I feel like it influenced my way of thinking in some way, made me more aware of the things I'll have to go through in life and helped me think about my stance on them. There's something to be said when a series that at first looked so simple, that I picked up as something to pass my free time with, is able to create such a connection between its themes and my life. I can say that it definitely won't have the same effect on everyone, it's not like you are at the same point in your life that I am, neither did you have the same life I did up to this point. SO, is it more of a personal series? Yeah, I'd say so. It became one of my favorite anime for those reasons. If you find its topics to be interesting or influential to you personally, then you may find it to be pretty good as well. I'll wrap this up with a quote from the series itself.\\n\r\n\"We simply cannot see the world as it is. The world people see is nothing more than how our brains translate it. In other words, it's subjective.\"\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8,5\\n\r\nSunday without God feels like a very underrated anime to me. I can see why it has the score that it has (sitting at 7.52 at the time of this review being written), the somewhat rushed characters and several hardly noticeable story elements scattered around for the reason of explaining the convoluted setting definitely can annoy many people out there, but I'm sure that if they would look at the hints that the show leaves some of the plot inconsistencies would disappear. I believe that the show doesn't have to say something straight to my face for me to understand it, and while I don't think doing so is wrong in some situations, I don't think Kamisama needed it. This is a story of a world, in which wishes are the strongest driving force for the remaining humans traversing it. Bigger or smaller, those dreams let them understand more than they ever could comprehend when the show started. Just like I did. the show really felt more meaningful when I noticed that it leaves those slight nudges for the viewer to catch. With those pieces I created a coherent picture, in which I don't see any holes left. Would this show benefit from more episodes? Yes, without a doubt it could get rid of all those doubts that I had, but I think it's more fun this way. What I got is a solid piece of work that could branch into multiple different directions if it only wants to do so in my head, and that's exactly why I love this show. I feel like this world is still open for me, so I can explore it in my imagination and in my dreams, but Ai's story feels complete. That's why I will defend it to death. If you ever feel like watching this show, I do recommend it. Maybe, just maybe, you'll find something for yourself, albeit I can't promise that.\\n\r\nIs this score unbiased? No, of course it isn't, just like any other score on this website. If you made it this far into the review, then you probably realized it by now. This series doesn't avoid mistakes, but I don't think it needed to. Sometimes shows with flaws can feel more charming than those that avoid them. I don't think that everyone who thinks this show is bad is an idiot, neither do I think higher of myself because I saw more in it. All I can say is that from now on every Sunday will remind me of this show. All the things this anime showed me will not be forgotten, I can at least guarantee you that.\\n\r\nIt's not like that's important to you or anything, but I really wanted to say it.\\n\\n\r\nAs always this is purely my opinion. I encourage you to develop your own.",

            "content": "Story: \r\nWhen someone talks to me about this series, the main part they mention is that the story is really interesting but most of the parts doesn't make sense and in my opinion i don't really see a problem with it. The episodes were usually 3-4 episodes an arc which was a good amount for them to have so we can get some character development and story in there before going to the next one. The pacing for the most part was okay and didn't feel like it was dragging on for ages. There are some parts of the series where you will either cryor feel depressed, i actually cried twice watching the series, and it just leaves with so many emotions that stay with you episode by episode. The story was really unique and was a interesting idea to cover. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe other thing people talk to me about that they feel hindered the anime was the artstyle. Complaining about it being to 'moe' and unoriginal, personally the artstyle dosen't bother me at all but i understand why people would not watch because of the artstyle. \\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\\n\r\nSound was great and used well, the opening and ending themes to the show are amazing and i know all the words to both of them. Both just flow well with the emotions of the show. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: \\n\\n\r\nThe characters in the series are pretty well done, a few could have rounded off a bit more and gave us more of a backstory to give us more depth. Ai and Alice were really good characters. Characters like Scar and the girls at Gola Acadamy could have been developed a lot more than they did especially Scar. But the characters were different and most were very well developed. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: \\n\\n\r\nOut of all my ratings on my lists, i mostly rate based on my enjoyment of the series. The series was well paced and every episode was different with some exciting and emotional segments which encourages me to rewatch it again and again and keep loads of enjoyment for it. I think the people who said they dont want to watch it for its moe artstyle should sit down and take in all the series has to offer.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\\n\r\nGreat series, can't wait for the OVA coming 2014 and hopefully that leads on to a second season because Kami-Nai really deserves it for it's original plot and great characters.",

            "content": "This will be my first anime review written, I  decided to start with this anime because I recently completed this series. We have our main character Ai, a small girl raised in a village where the whole world was abandoned by god, as the obvious title would imply, and is in search of her father as well as completing her mother's dream.\r\nStory 6/10\r\nA story with a good plot where Ai the main character decides to finish her mother's goal, but changes it midway through and decides to \"save the world\". This anime had a lot of potential, I did not read the light novel,however I felt like this anime was rushed towards the end, it had an excellent start. I was watching this and was like \"wow! this is actually really interesting\". AS the series progressed it felt as if the author was changing the plot, and Ai wasn't really making Near the end of the series I started wondering if it was going to end in the way I had thought. The ending was completely different from what I am imagined, and it had various flaws near the end of the series, you'll understand what I mean when you are watching it. The ending itself was very confusing, I may say it did suck but that's my own opinion, I was completely in shock at the ending because of the way they displayed it. \\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is phenomenal, absolutely stunning and breath-taking. The way they display each scene, for example when Ai is considered a \"grave keeper\", a person who is capable of burying the \"dead\". In the synopsis if you've read it, it explains that since god abandoned the world, people stopped dying as well as being born, which means only a grave keeper may bury that person who is \"supposed\" to be dead. When Ai buries multiple people as the series goes on it has a absolutely beautiful glow as if there was very light almost elusive coloured lights showing that person's spirit being released. Also, near the end of the series there are two incredibly gorgeous scenes, I felt like I was totally in the scene myself. \\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound, just like the art is beautiful, the opening and ending themes are okay itself but when people are killed, and \"special\" things occur in the series, the sound effects are just wonderful and it really fits the mood of the scene. Each scene has a sound or music fit for the scene and it makes you feel as if you were there, the speed in which it flows the tempo matches the scene almost perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters fit their personality and what they look like in my opinion. Ai, is a bit of a knuckle head, however it is because she is just so pure and innocent. Hampnie Hambert, I won't spoil who he is, but I wish there was more of him. He's what got me into the story, since he played a big part in the beginning of the story, in search of someone named Anna, and you'll see what I mean by episode 3 when I mean he plays a big part. All the characters have a significant impact in the story and they're all unique in their own way, however a few characters were not necessary, especially in the Goran Academy Arc. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10\\n\\n\r\nNow, even though I gave a 9/10, a 10/10 a 8/10 and a 6/10, the reason why I gave it an overall 7/10 is because, the ending was very confusing and unless they release an OVA or something of that sort it's going to stay as a 7/10. This anime certainly had a LOT of potential, but the author just added a lot of useless and unnecessary parts especially the Goran Academy Arc, at least in my opinion. If the anime turned out to be a 25 episode, it may have have turned out to be a 9/10, but for now a 7/10 is what I'd give it. If you're looking for a decent story, beautiful art and sound, and the feeeelssss, then this anime is definitely worth watching. Just that some parts felt rushed and didn't have enough in-depth to make it a totally awesome series.",

            "content": "This is such a bizarre anime. I\u2019ve seen anime and movies with trippy imagery. I\u2019ve read stories with pages of gibberish, yet few works of fiction left me with a sense of culture shock like this. Such anime are so original it\u2019s hard to make them truly terrible, since the novelty value is there. Creators also tend to be as confused as the viewer, so they rarely reach their full potential.\r\nWhen you have a unique premise on your hands that doesn\u2019t owe anything to any tradition, there are two ways to go about it. You can either go full retard, mine the premise for anythingit has and throw the kitchen sink along with everything. Since you have no idea how your anime is supposed to work, all you can do is try everything and hope something sticks. There\u2019s a famous anime who did this and it\u2019s called Future Diary.\\n\\n\r\nThe other route is the safer one. You let your story flow, but you never try too hard to understand it. You let characters interact and explore your world, but you refrain from anything too attention-grabbing. The anime will narrow its focus. Its structure will become almost RPG-like, giving the protagonist a basic objective to complete and finish it off.\\n\\n\r\nSundays Without God takes the latter route, but the result isn\u2019t a complete failure. Despite not playing with the structure, its setting and premise are so weird that the feeling of culture shock is persistent. The stories that make up the anime are also good enough on their own and take advantage of the setting. You cannot tell them in any other context. Still, something feels off. It\u2019s not completely weird, not completely normal and leans towards the weird without mining it too much. The result is anime that\u2019s enjoyable like an ordinary anime while feeling weird.\\n\\n\r\nThe best thing about the anime is it unique setting and tone. It\u2019s a perfect example of how you don\u2019t need a lot of details to create a unique world. The world here is simple. God is gone, no one can get born and dead people don\u2019t really die. It\u2019s apocalypse in slow motion. We\u2019ve had a lot of stories about what happens after the apocalypse and we tend to imagine it as something swift and fast. Here, the world is in the process of ending.\\n\\n\r\nHuman beings are resilient things, though. Even if the sun will explode, we\u2019ll most likely try to save something. Survival instinct is so strong that it defies rationality and free will. In this case, the world isn\u2019t ending so much as life reaches its epilogue. Life isn\u2019t bad, but it keeps moving in an ordinary pace towards its ending.\\n\\n\r\nWhat do you do when you\u2019re the last generation? The anime is essentially about this, but it seems so weirded out by its premise it doesn\u2019t really explore it. The first stories deal directly with these themes \u2013 one character is about to be the last of the last generation, which is the worst isolation you can have. The city of the dead is an interesting expressions of the Metaphysical Rebellion \u2013 how we can rebel against our circumstances and reject them.\\n\\n\r\nThe structure doesn\u2019t prevent exploration of these topics, since many shows used shorter length with depth. The method of storytelling gets in the way. There\u2019s an objective to solve, and the characters spend more time trying to solve it. While the pacing isn\u2019t thriller-like, it\u2019s too fast for such a premise. It doesn\u2019t slow down enough to show how characters exist outside the story.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\u2019 existence outside the story is one of the best ways to convince us they\u2019re real, to make us care about them and see their humanity. Stories are something humans create and we don\u2019t live in just one. A focused storyteller shows snippets of other stories the characters can have, but then goes back to the main one. A master storyteller can imply these side-stories and connect them to the main plotline. The anime doesn\u2019t do this. Its focus is too narrow.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s a shame, because the storytelling is quite excellent. The format is familiar \u2013 we have a good, well-meaning character visiting people and helping them. Ai isn\u2019t just a vehicle to tell the stories of these people. Her personality and position is directly tied to her role. In a world where everyone\u2019s ready to die or desperately fighting death, she\u2019s a piece of light. She\u2019s the youngest person alive, a possibility that there might be a future.\\n\\n\r\nShe\u2019s not a lantern, though. When things go bad, Ai doesn\u2019t say some nice things and the story ends. Often, she gives those pep talks but stumbles. The world is, after all, ending. Problems still exist and are hard to solve. Ai may be an optimist, but she\u2019s a struggling optimist. We see her doubts, how much she tries to cling to her optimism despite everything.\\n\\n\r\nThis is where the anime\u2019s faults lay. Although this is an excellent usage of such a character, they don\u2019t take it far enough. Ai struggles, but the creators put her so much in the role of problem-solver she doesn\u2019t have time to ingest the struggling. There\u2019s no time to see how the possible failures affect Ai\u2019s psych. Stories don\u2019t always end just like she wants them to, and that should influence her worldview. How do you stay optimistic when things don\u2019t go as expected? Do you blind your own eyes? Do you become pessimistic, or do you accept things as they are? The anime never addresses these questions.\\n\\n\r\nThe themes of wishing does make its appearance, but the creators aren\u2019t sure what to do with it. People wish for things. Sometimes they come true, sometimes they don\u2019t and sometimes they come true but the result is painful. It speaks volumes when a messy anime like Big Order addresses these themes better. They\u2019re present, but wishing is not a plot device here and there aren\u2019t enough angles to explore this topic from. It\u2019s just there.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style continues the weird nature of the quality. The character\u2019s looks are distinct and memorable enough, but the art style itself isn\u2019t. You can put these characters in a school anime and they wouldn\u2019t feel out of place (except for the outfits). There\u2019s variety in how everyone looks and the school arc lets them show off their designs, but nothing connects it. Characters shouldn\u2019t just look distinct but there should be a style that connects them, quirks that make the design memorable and make you wonder what else you can do with it.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, the color schemes and backgrounds are beautiful. The anime finally fulfills potential. The colors are balanced. Light and dark tones are mixed. A burning red or a cold blue is are the dominating colors, and they have just enough brightness to make the world seem normal. There\u2019s also a little darkness in them that reminds you that the world is dying. It\u2019s a balance that\u2019s hard to get. You can easily find yourself in bland colors, but here they\u2019re the perfect mix of darkness and lights that fit the weird tone of the series.\\n\\n\r\nSundays Without God is a flawed anime, but nevertheless an anime like no other. Its failures hold it back from greatness, and but their nature prevents them from being offensive. When it falls, it\u2019s not because it does stupid things. Rather, it\u2019s too afraid to play with its ideas. They stand on their own, and even as basic storytelling it\u2019s good enough. Someone might one day run away with these and render this irrelevant, but until then it\u2019s worth your time.\\n\\n\r\n3.5 sundays out of 5",

            "content": "First of all I'm sorry if i include a little bit spoilers in my review, I will try to not include anyin my review.\r\nLet's start with the story first, Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi is basically an anime about a Gravekeeper named Ai that wants to \"save\" the world when god abandoned it on sunday by travelling around the world and solving problems.\r\nThe story itself isn't bad in my opinion but the only problem is that they have shown it to us in a wrong way.\r\nThe story is basically in pieces without any or little connection between them they could release a 3/4 Episode OVA's andyou could get the same results.\\n\r\nIt's jumping from an problem to an another problem this isn't a big issue but an problem only lasts for 3-4 episodes max which gives me unexplained parta of the story.\\n\\n\r\nIt definitely has it up and down moments for example the Humpnie Humbert (or what his name was) arc was very good in my opinion but again with the problem described above, new introduced characters only lasts for a couple of episodes and then they have fallen into a black gap without ever reminding it anymore through the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art itself was very good, It was one of the best animation that i have seen, they have mixed the colours and theme very well, This defenitily is a + Point of the whole anime.\\n\\n\r\nThere isn't any bad points about the OST of the anime, I really liked the OP and the ED becuase they were really catchy for me atleast, i doubt they could do it any better.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the charactera again, The MC \"Ai\" has developed cery much through the anime, she started very weak in the beginning but became more brave at the end but the other characters of the anime haven't really told me anything.\\n\r\nLike i said before the introduced characters only lasts for a couple of episodes (with the ezception of uri,scar and Ai) and then they are forgotten and never reminded anymore which is a - point for me.\\n\r\nI do understand they are limited in episodes and want to complete it as fast as possible but this won't help anyone or me atleast.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime overall wasn't bad with the exception of the above named points,  i do recommendes you watch this anime because i did enjoy the anime till the end but it has still left some questions in my head especially about the end which will never be explained.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Warning: This review will contain (limited, but possibly deal-breaking) spoilers.  I feel it impossible to explain myself without delving into the story specifics. You have been warned.\r\nI will skip the summary, I assume you have it at the top of the page. Suffice to say, the undead, no more babies, and a little Gravekeeper three years too young to exist, Ai.  As my other reviews show, while animation and mood are nice, I focus on acting and story. So this will slant in those directions. For that reason, you will find I am rather negative.\r\nI am not someone who has read the bookseries, so when Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi (hereafter KIN) popped up on the season's list, I was intrigued.  I didn't quite know what to expect. I purposefully approached the series on its own merits, without research about the background, to let the show stand on its own. I am always of the opinion I should not have to do homework to enjoy a work.  There was but a brief description about the premise, and color me interested, I tuned in the very first week.\\n\\n\r\nAfter the first few episodes, I wanted this show to blow everything else out of the water. I wanted to LOVE this show.  I wanted to parade this series around come the fall like it was the next Fullmetal, or Death Note, or Madoka.  It very early on demonstrated a theme of \"hope within absolute darkness\".  It had little girl tea-party heartwarming alongside the living dead. Ai was a fantastic character, really every character is fantastic. This show was going places.  I was sad at the end of the Humphney Humbert arc, but who wouldn't be? But I was left with a complete sense of....contentment. KIN had an excellent pace, and seemed to know exactly where to put its focus. The art was beautiful, eerily beautiful for a show about (essentially) the twilight of humanity. The music was spot on, and voice actors perfectly cast. Of all the series I was watching (some five), KIN was at the top of my list, the one I anxiously stood on edge for to see next week.\\n\\n\r\nThe second arc was similarly splendid. It elaborated on the themes of the HH arc.  It built on that Ai being a Gravekeeper was a splendid thing. And in Ortus, it was a dangerous thing. The kingdom of the dead.  It was a natural development in the consequences of such a world.  It was excellent political development without bashing you over the head. Things were strange to our eyes, with fascinating culture of the dead (like the wearing of Venetian masks to hide the decay of flesh, an unspoken but fascinating concept), and here we learned of the true power of wishing, and that prayers of those close to death seemed to come true.  I was still excited for KIN. I still held it up high.\\n\\n\r\nBut at that point, the structure broke down.  And it's not hard to see where things went wrong. In the tug of war between remaining faithful to the books, and telling a good story for TV, it was the books that won.  The series is divided into four arcs. Each one, I presume (again, having not read the books, but judging from the pace) was based on an individual book.  While this keeps the material fresh, and avoids hammering the same points over and over, and we see the characters grow perhaps more than we might have, it leaves the short series, a mere 12 episodes, without focus.  The Humpney Humbert arc and Ortus arc were connected. Not tightly, but they built off previous themes and expanded on the logic of the universe.  The School arc mostly existed to explore the concept of wishing. It introduced us to Dee and Alice, who would be the main characters in the Bubble World arc, but Ai's status as a Gravekeeper was little more than a flimsy pretense to drag her into the school. After that, it was never important.  There was no sense of how this little girl would meet, and pass, or fail, the challenge that came with \"saving the world\".  The Bubble World arc was almost its own series entirely. Even Ai doesn't notice when her shovel goes missing, so absent is the \"important\" job of being a Gravekeeper from the front line that it seems almost superfluous to the entire show by the end.  We get the sense that Ai is a special child, but not because of her Gravekeeper status. This could have worked for the series, but the disconnect between pieces leaves much to be desired.\\n\\n\r\nAs difficult as it is to say, I would rate this series almost within a \"dramatic slice of life\" category.  While there is episode-to-episode continuity, there is no real feeling of change beyond characters entering and exiting.  Scar almost seems to come along because we needed an extra butt filling a seat, and even then she and Yuri are mostly shoved aside after the Ortus arc. The two characters who seemed to be role models to Ai at the beginning, one who would teach her to be a Gravekeeper, and one who would teach her to be Human, really didn't do anything besides be old enough to drive.  Which is a shame because they both have such interesting backstories and personalities. They kept getting shoved aside for guest stars, and when Dee and Alice show up it seems like we traded out old models for new ones.\\n\\n\r\nAi herself changes little. She goes from seeing \"the world is this way\" to \"okay, the world is not this way, but it should be\"  The problem is that, while this is growth, this growth is complete by episode 4. She then halfway reboots, paying lip service to the previous lessons, but still holding on to her naivete. Only in the Bubble World does she seem to have a more worldly view that things are happy, but wrong, but this change doesn't seem to come -from- anything.\\n\\n\r\nOn the whole, KIN's strengths are in its concepts, and its flaws are in its execution. A world without traditional death, and with Gravekeepers, who seem to be some organic AI? Fascinating.  Number of times that is relevant to the series? Three. And one is monologued at us. A kingdom of the dead, the true realization of Ai's mother's hopeful dream? Wonderfully shot, beautifully animated, but there are no true consequences of this visit.  An organization that seeks to check the power of the prayer? Could be truly interesting. But came off as little more than stuffy old people being mean old people.  A bubble world where someone died, yet still had a wish fulfilled? A few -hours- difference that strains credulity? Never even brought up. Scar, a Gravekeeper who is good natured, yet heartless in her pursuit of duty? We are told this, and it is conveniently side-stepped in Ortus, and never comes again.  Or her later transformation into something more sapient? Nothing. Yuri, a man who lost his family, and really only takes in Ai at the beginning of some misplaced sense of responsibility for the death of his daughter and his love/hate relationship with Humphney? Not important.\\n\\n\r\nWhile all these issues CAN be put off in a lengthy book series, they are woefully crippling to a 12 episode anime. A series can not be entirely about set-up, there has to be some rolling resolution to go along with the introduction of all the elements.  Perhaps that is not possible. Perhaps the books themselves limit the continuation, but I cite Fullmetal Alchemist, which took the identical starting material, and made their own conclusions.  Conclusions that some people find superior (though I am not among them). This series had ways to avoid the four-arc trap. They could have focused more heavily on two, they could have stayed loyal and halfway in, diverted from continuity.  They could have merely edited the ending to tie all four chaotic arcs together (there was an easy way).\\n\\n\r\nIn summary, out of everything this season, Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi was, personally, my biggest disappointment for summer 2013. If its mission was to interest me in one day picking up the novels? Sure. I'd say it succeeded, if only to find out.  If it was to be an entertaining show I could recommend? It falls just short. I can't bring myself to call it anything more than average. Watch it if it intrigues you, by all means. But if you're looking for that next special series, I, grudgingly, must vote that you move along.",

            "content": "Sunday without God is an outstanding experience that combines a menacing atmosphere, suspenseful situations, and a well-developed main protagonist into one of the most memorable anime in the thriller/tragedy genres.\r\nThis anime is tremendous for many reasons.  Firstly, Ai\u2019s character and her development throughout the show is something to behold as her kind and caring personality palpably serves as the moral compass in the brutal and horrifying setting this show has to offer.  We are introduced to Ai in the Valley of Death arc as her innocent and very young personality must already learn to overcome extreme tragedy.  She meets Hampnie Hambart whoshe thinks may have deep connections to her, but as it turns out his personality is extremely harsh and unforgiving.  The confrontations and interactions between Hambart and Ai during the beginning of the show sets the tone for the harsh and strong emotion Ai\u2019s personality drives throughout much of the story.  The writers also utilize her character to push many grave and tragic emotions to great effect.  Much of the reason why these moments with Ai are so heavy is due to her personality being appreciably normal which effectively represents a young girl her age.  Therefore, when she is confronted with hardship she emotes as a very real and identifiable young child.  The result is tons of unrestrained emotion.  The writers also brilliantly use the heavily detailed animation to capture Ai\u2019s expressions of fear and sadness throughout much of the opening and by the end of episode 3 we already feel a deep connection to Ai\u2019s character, and the development does not stop there.  Throughout much of her journey we see Ai having to confront and discover the worlds many secrets and the meaning of being a gravekeeper.  In the Ortis city arc we see Ai\u2019s personality grow further as her wisdom and matureness shines when she must confront the complex leaders and dwellers of the city.  This leads to many interesting and unique situations as she learns to deal with a complex world and characters.  This builds to a very intense and fascinating concluding arc in which Ai must apply her experiences to convince others to face the harsh reality of the world they live in.  Ai is not only the best aspect of this show, but one of the most impactful characters in the realm of the thriller/tragedy genres.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime also features a plethora of beautiful cinematography, memorable soundtracks, and suspenseful sequences which work in tandem to capture the beauty and horror of the world God left behind.  This combination is effective because the writers treat the setting as a living character.  From the long drawn out shots of the sun shining on Ai\u2019s village, to the suspenseful and eerie sequences of ominous music used to introduce the city of Ortis, the anime certainly pulled me into the world and provoked my interests.  The show also features a few sequences of extreme terror and violence proving the anime is unrestrained.  These sequences heavily caught me off guard because the writers amazingly use the phenomenal animation to show the beauty of the world, so when we are introduced to the more frightening aspects of the story coupled with Ai\u2019s intensity it successfully constructs the realism of the setting.  Suspenseful sequences where Ai and her new friends discover unfamiliar elements of the world are also plentiful throughout the story.  From the scenes focusing on the expressions of the characters to the silent moments of their journeys throughout the vastness of the world, the writers know how to build anticipation and take \u201cshowing the story\u201d to a whole new level.  All of these themes remarkably came together to create some memorable and intense experiences.\\n\\n\r\nThis all being said Sunday without God is not a complete masterpiece.  Firstly, the show is told in three different arcs that do not heavily relate to each other by the end of the show.  As someone who watched this without any knowledge of the anime at all, I was expecting a payoff where all three arcs would come together by the conclusion, but they never did.  This left for a bit of a letdown ending.  Secondly, aside from Hampnie Hambart in the first arc, the side cast is not particularly that memorable or well developed.  Most of the time this is also due to the three arc structure as the side cast comes and goes to often leaving little time to feature a ton of maturation or development.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, these were all subsidiary issues.  I still loved this anime because of Ai\u2019s journey and the sensational and intense atmosphere throughout the show.  If you are a fan of the thriller/tragedy genres you should definitely check this out.\\n",

However, there are plot holes in my opinion that take away the \"good stuff\" from the story. \r\nThe art seems to be pretty good (7) in my opinion. (of all the anime I have watched.) A sidenote: I watched it in 480p on Crunchyroll so it might differ.\r\nThe characters in this anime seem to be appearing and fading out, as well as not much development(in my opinion). So I rate it as a 5.\\n\\n\r\nMy overall ENJOYMENT of this anime is an 8 because it is anime. No pressure on it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, averaging rating of this anime for me is a 6.",

            "content": "Sunday Without God was one of the most intriguing anime originated from a light novel that i picked up for the reason the title of this anime and the synopsis that i read is quite stimulating. I thought the reason this anime rarely discussed or recommended by people is perhaps the title could be offensive for some people. This show also looks gorgeous from the poster so without hesitation i picked this one to watch.\r\nThis show can be easily divided into four arcs with three episodes for each arc, hence the name of the episodes based on the name of the arc followed by romannumerals. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters are kinda well designed. First, we have Ai the gravekeeper that looks like the well-known magical girl Sakura Kinomoto from Cardcaptor Sakura that looks more polished that always bringing her spade in her back in her journey and really cheerful for a 12 years old girl that buries the dead. Also there is Hampnie Hambart, that grey-haired teen looking guy who searches for a woman that cannot be found anywhere that has jarring personality that leads to many problematic decisions but also having a lenient side is the character that stands out in this show. Heck, he makes the show in the first few episodes really an engaging start with provision of strong scenes. In the second half of the series there are characters that involved in the story arc that is really unexpected from what i expected from the first. Those characters add the certain flavor to the storyline yet also average at best.\\n\\n\r\nDue to the ambitious synopsis that is just outside the limitations. I put high expectations in watching this anime and that gave me feelings of disappointment. This anime ended in a way that i didn't want this show to end. The show ended in a bad way possible for the show that introduced itself with the concept of God created everything to the world and forsook it and left the watchers with such a trivial ending in the worst arc that is just not acceptable. This anime could have been more longer to have potentially better conclusion than the current but it didn't.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough this anime doesn't have a conclusion that satisfy the watchers, it does have really beautiful artwork for an anime creation. In fact, this anime original artwork is one of my favorites by how the artwork is really stands out and fits with the shadings that is really show its dominance. Just too gorgeous, i even downloaded some of this anime desktop wallpapers to please myself.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is worth it in certain aspects  but the storyline could have been better. Still, the art style and charm that this show brings to watchers is pleasing and worthwhile to look into. If you just want to pass some hours in your life with eye pleasing scenes then watching this show must be an okay choice to make. (6/10)",

I love this format, and the first two arcs are fantastic, exactly what i expected from the show. We are introduced to a great main character who is thrown into extreme circumstances and we are introduced to two (although quite bland) supporting cast members. Each new arc brings new characters into play, this is both a blessing and a curse, in the beginning this is fantastic, by theend it starts to get annoying. Its sad because the first 6 episodes were so good, lots of flashbacks, a more complex story about our protagonist trying to understand her past, by the end, this is sidelined for a whack sub-plot about a charter you don't really care about in the whole scheme of things. This is meant to be dark, and it started out dark, it is meant to be funny, it was in the beginning, it is meant to be epic, it was in the beginning. Maybe if there is a second season this will be resolved and the larger themes and plot lines brought back into the forefront, i hope so. The animation was mixed, i like the style of it, lots of shadow and light but at times it just seemed rather cheap unfortunately. Great soundtrack. Great character development in the beginning, by the end, not so much.",

Each character has their own opinion about the world after God abandons it. Not only that but they give out their reasoning and it really makesyou think as well as understand why the characters do what they do and how it's made them to be.  I really liked the arcs within this series and I think this anime could've gone longer if not for the ending. The ending left me with more questions than answers but it makes me want to pick up the novel for it so that's what I'll do. I do recommend this anime though.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art was beautiful. The way they made movements flow along together. Bodies weren't exaggerated so I didn't have to see huge boobs flying at me mid-screen. There was an abundance of colors and it felt very beautiful. It made me think sort of like watching the sun rise and then set.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nLOVED THE MUSIC! The ED and OP were so befitting of the anime. The opening is a great entrance to the anime and it's right on topic too.  It wasn't super upbeat but it had a great tune that gave sort of a mysterious touch. The ED was a great closure to watch every time. Soft and smooth enough to give a comfortable feeling. Kinda a bittersweet feeling. The music played during the anime was very touching. Pianos, opera-like music ...all beautiful. No song felt out of place during the anime and it didn't randomly start at scenes are hit with high notes that it'd scare you. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were quite different and their construction was restricted to their world and their actions. Each character had their purpose and they influenced one another through their abilities and understanding of the world. The way they interacted through love or friendship seemed very realistic to me. Not counting any magical usage, the characters seemed to be on top. Though I believe the main character could've used a bit more development by the end of the series, I didn't hate any characters. That's pretty rare as I usually have at least ONE character I hate.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nWatched the anime in roughly two days because I enjoyed it so much. Everything blended together so I really liked it. Probably shouldn't have watched it before a midterm though...but it proves how much I enjoyed it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nIt's a great anime with wonderful music (seriously....WONDERFUL music) and story. It could be A LOT more if not for some initial errors but there's always answers in novels/mangas and such. Definitely worthy to pick up if you want to pass some time or just enjoy a good brain picker. \\n\r\n\u30fe(*\u30fb\u03c9\u30fb)\u30ce\u309c\u2606\u309c\u30fe(\u30fb\u03c9\u30fb*)\u30ce",

            "content": "This is one of those cases when the synopsis, while being absolutely correct, seems to promise a completely different experience from the one you're about to get. I went into this series expecting a plot driven show where most of the intrigue comes from the world itself, which seemed the case early one, since the beginning of the show focuses on the world's rules, people being unable to die, the Gravekeepers and whatnot. Later on, though, attention starts being shifted to character exploration and eventually Ai, the lead, just flat out says she has completely forgotten about her role as a Gravekeeper.\r\nSo, if one wereeager to get a coherent narrative filled with mysteries and coming to its ultimate resolution in the end, they'd be pretty disappointed to see this show consists of a number of subplots connected mostly by Ai's determination to save the world, no less, which leads to a road trip of sorts. Luckily, these subplots and characters they focus on were more than enough to keep me invested in what was happening, also helped by the fact that there's little to no filler, all the episodes feel as an essential part of the story. In the end it resembles Cloud Atlas done right: the subplots are similarly connected by one main theme, namely, dreams and wishes, but there's no obvious message that can be clearly tracked through most of the parts, in fact, different points of view are represented and, in the end, none are completely discarded.\\n\\n\r\nSurprisingly for a show that consists of a handful of pretty much separate stories, there are not so many significant characters here but they are well written and none feel unidentifiable, although there is a guy who's simply boring. Some are straightforward, some evolve throughout the series (Ai, in particular), some end up being not quite what they seemed - all that good stuff is here. The twists (and there are a couple) are genuinely well done and the stories are interesting, each shedding some light on what did God abandoning Earth really mean and the consequences of this event. The ending gives somewhat of a conclusion to Ai's desire but leaves many things open for interpretation, which I always like.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is simply gorgeous, it's drawn in clear lines and colored beautifully. There are some effects, particularly later on, which also look fantastic. The main character managed to look as a generic young girl yet still be unique at the same time. Hell, the chief animator's other credits include working on Death Note, which, although extremely controversial, is also extremely beautiful, so it figures. Bottom line - this anime looks great. Voice acting is also very good. Nothing much to say here, it's just good. As it usually is with this particular aspect, there isn't much to comment on except if there are some unusual tricks, flaws or just very-well recognizable voices. That's not the case.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime explores an interesting and, to be honest, underutilized theme of dreams and wishes (at least I think it does). Seriously, it was mostly covered in Disney animated movies (and knockoffs of those but that's a sad story), and in a largely stupid way. They promised that dreams come true. This show, in return, asks: \"Well, is it good?\".  A fine question with no clear answer; add some great animation, interesting plots and identifiable characters and voila - you get Sunday Without God (English title). A cocktail I was happy to try out, might I add.",

The MCs design was nice and some other charactters were pretty well designed. \\n\r\nThe enviroments and backgrounds were beautiful and I have nothing to complain about with it.\\n\\n\r\nSound 77/100\\n\\n\r\nThe OST was very good and by far the most enjoyable thing with the series.\\n\r\nThe opening was not bad but it felt like something that you've heard a lot of times before, in other words pretty generic. \\n\r\nOverall the background music was beautiful, gave a nice touch to the world they we're in and made the enviroments feel alive.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 32/100\\n\\n\r\nThe series weakest point together with the plot. \\n\r\nMost of the characters were COMPLETELY unmemorable and I don't even recall one moment I genuinely sympathised with them. \\n\r\nThe MC was the only one I cared for but not even in a deep way.\\n\r\nIn the last 4 episodes the series kinda puts aside the MC to introduce 2 new characters and for the last episodes their story is the one that is in focus. \\n\r\nI don't know what they were trying to do when they created this anime, it's far too few episodes to start something new and especially when they are the last episodes of the whole anime.\\n\r\nA lot of times the characters did things that contradicted the laws and rules that the series had created for it self, and you'll wait for an explanation why they were able to do it but.... no! No explanations, the characters don't even bother talking about it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 35/100\\n\\n\r\nIf you just look past the plot holes, not relatable characters, non consistent plot and just not use your brain for 5 hours I'm sure you'll be able to enjoy this anime. \\n\r\nI myself like animes with plots that are consistent, relatable and interesting characters and a setting that spans over 12 episodes.\\n\r\nI can't say I hated watching it but I can't really say I enjoyed it that much.\\n\r\nThe only reason I kept watching was to hope that they just make something good and EXPLAIN something with the last episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 41/100\\n\\n\r\n+Art was good\\n\r\n+Soundtrack was good\\n\\n\r\n-Plot holes galore\\n\r\n-Bland characters\\n\r\n-Non existing/consistent plot\\n",

            "content": "Sunday Without God is my favourite anime of all time, for the simple reason that it is presented with captivating beauty and passion.\r\nBeautiful is the word that comes to mind with Sunday Without God. \r\nIn an artform where presentation is key, Sunday Without God nails it perfectly. For me, every frame is a lush watercolour painting, with dazzling hues of orange and purple. The soundtrack is magical, accompanying each scene with just the right touch of atmosphere. \r\nIt is difficult to do the surrealness of the show's landscapes any justice with prose alone, so if you have been kind enough to read this far, perhapsconsider searching up the OP or an AMV on Youtube? I do believe that few would not be pleasantly surprised by the amount of love dedicated to tracing out every line, shading in the various tints of colour.\\n\\n\r\nThe premise is unique, to say the least, depicting a world where humans have stopped reproducing; akin to the famed Children of Men, though with a decidedly different (and one I personally enjoyed more) take on the matter. The writing is certainly fascinating, although short of being absolutely spectacular. It is, however, definitely a breath of fresh air - the show serves up generous doses of originality with its creative takes on common plot points, such as time loops and imprisonment, and certainly wastes no time with needless pandering.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the greatest charm is the protagonist, Ai - the only child in a world robbed of childbirth, humanity's greatest gift. She captures all the hope and beauty left in a world that \"God abandoned\", and this brightness shows through in every scene she's in. Her innocence allows even heavier themes, such as death and ostracism, to be handled in a warm and positive, yet thoughtful way.\\n\\n\r\nPlot criticism may be centered around the show's naiivety, where nothing explicitly bad ever happens to anyone in the main cast, evil and malice are nonexistent, and love and warmth reign supreme. The way I see it, this is the show's merit - it must be seen as a children's storybook.\\n\\n\r\nSunday Without God does not claim to be a thematic masterpiece that tackles and deconstructs controversial issues, nor does it see itself as an idea-intensive show for the thinking man, or an overly plot-heavy or character-driven tour de force. It is, if anything, a picture book - a work of not art, nor any great educational significance, but a work of beauty. To be appreciated, to be caressed, to be loved. I cannot fault the show for not having a gripping plot, or complex and dynamic characters, or not fully exploring its unique premise - that is not its intent. Sunday Without God is not an ambitious show by any stretch. It is a heartwarming, simple tale that is a treat for the senses.\\n\\n\r\nTherefore, a word of forewarning: one might be disappointed, or even frustrated, by the show if one is expecting anything novel, thrilling, or overly intelligent. In my mind, the show was made for the sole purpose of being enjoyed, and if one seeks to be soothed, to be comforted, to be warmed, then Sunday Without God is undoubtedly one of the best anime out there.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, anime, as an artform, is unique because it transcends the limits of film and television even with the advent of CGI, and rare is the show where this key quality shines through. Anime, for me, can tell a story with an easy, yet almost surreal beauty that other mediums cannot, presenting a fantasised version of a world that is hauntingly beautiful. It makes the world look more perfect and beautiful than it ever can in the real world; it is fantasy in its purest form, and this show knows this.\\n\\n\r\nSunday Without God doesn't capture the mind, nor does it want to - it captures the heart, and leaves you feeling warm and fuzzy inside.\\n",

            "content": "Wow... Of all the anime I've reviewed this is definitely one of the most difficult to give a grade to. Based on the other reviews I've seen here you guys seem to agree, as I've seen scores that are absolutely all over the place. I can't imagine any scenario in which this show is anywhere close to a 10 or anywhere close to a 3- and I've seen both scores multiple times. Here's my take to the best of my ability, but, at the end of the day this is one of those anime you simply have to see for yourself.\r\nArt-\r\nThe presentation as a wholedeserves high praise. The art was very pretty throughout and in a few moments outright beautiful. Multiple of the moments involving death had a beauty and eloquence to them that I really appreciated. The animation is smooth and fluid and the art style fits the world the anime creates very nicely and never feels out of place.\\n\\n\r\nSound-\\n\\n\r\nInexplicably, there is no music or sound whatsoever on the blu ray main screen or episode select screen, which is weird and lame to begin with and even more so given how good the soundtrack is in this show. The music is outright beautiful and it really complements the often emotional messages the anime is trying to convey.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was above average and never bad but it wasn't ever fantastic either. The main character, voiced by Caitlyn French in the dub, provides a passable but generic voice performance. Overall there was a lot of mediocrity in the voice performances as a whole. Personally I think the best performance in the dub was provided by Tyler Galindo as Kiriko, but ultimately this character wasn't all that important to the final product.\\n\\n\r\nStory-\\n\\n\r\nThe story here is really hard to talk about and rate for multiple reasons. For one, it's all over the place. It very much felt like this anime had four barely connected, standalone mini arcs that happened to take place in the same universe. Beyond that they felt disjointed, fragmented and very much lacking cohesion. I almost feel like I watched three or four different mini anime as opposed to one whole one. Interestingly, all four arcs were genuinely good as standalone products, with the second being my personal favorite and the third in my opinion being the weakest, but they simply didn't feel connected or relevant to each other. In fact, I'd argue damn near everything that happens in the first two arcs- which is the first half of the entire show- basically doesn't matter at all as far as the bigger picture plot is concerned.\\n\\n\r\nThe other problem is that this anime is not actually about, or even close to about, what the synopsis and the back of the blu ray box tell you it is about. The main character is established very early on to be a gravekeeper- an extremely important supernatural being that can properly put the dead to rest, which no one else is able to do- and this is presented to be an extremely important plot point that I thought would be absolutely core to the anime from start to finish, but as it turned out that couldn't have been much further from the truth. The gravekeeper thing as a whole is CRIMINALLY under-explored and underdeveloped and quite literally- not hyperbole- the main character uses her gravekeeper powers to put the dead to rest in episode one and then once in episode three and then LITERALLY NEVER AGAIN THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE ANIME! It felt to me like the fact that she is a gravekeeper was super irrelevant after the third episode. I couldn't believe they did so little with this interesting, unique premise that I thought had all the potential in the world.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development as a whole left a lot to be desired as the arcs are just so self-contained and separate from one another than you only really get to know a lot of characters for 2 or 3 episodes before they're gone forever. Very few characters ultimately matter in this anime and there certainly isn't a single character from this show I'll look back on and still remember or remotely care about one month after watching it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-\\n\\n\r\nThis is such a tough category because the anime is artistically beautiful and has a lovely soundtrack from start to finish and each of the four arcs, individually, are solid and enjoyable. However, though this anime was not intended to be episodic it often felt like it was anyway and with the plot simply feeling disjointed and disconnected, you inevitably lose something along the way. For the most part I enjoyed and was entertained by what I was watching, but I was having a really hard time connecting with or caring about any of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is just... unique. I've never seen another anime quite like this, for better or worse, and it definitely wasn't what I was expecting (or even close to it) based on the description the blu ray box and the Wiki page provide. It's a show I ultimately felt \"somewhere in the middle\" about, though closer to positive than negative, and while I would probably recommend it at the end of the day it wouldn't be something I'd treat as a high priority watch or come into with sky high expectations.\\n\\n\r\n+A sense of beauty and eloquence in many of the sadder scenes\\n\r\n+Beautiful soundtrack\\n\r\n+Four distinct, solid arcs that are all nice watches on their own\\n\\n\r\n-Disjointed, all over the place story that lacks cohesion\\n\r\n-Very lacking character development\\n\r\n-Wasted, criminally under-explored base premise\\n\\n\r\nOBJECTIVE RATING- 7-7.5\\n\r\nPERSONAL ENJOYMENT RATING- 7.5",

I think it was because of how incohesive the story seemed to be at that time. \r\nBut now, having matured, I can appreciate the story fully. Like you may have read in the Forum Discussions, many points and aspects were not explained or left to be ambiguous. But if you just thought about it, everything is actually inter-connected and the explanations are as clear as day. \r\nI've really enjoyed this anime and I think I'll pick up the LN now.",

            "content": "Well, I've got mixed feelings about this anime. It was introduced to me by a friend (very enthusiastic about it). I'm not sure what to start with. At first, I thought I was going to enjoy the story even though the main character is a twelve-year-old [but looking like nine or so] cutie-pie girl. I'm not fond of this type.\r\nAlors, art first: wonderful colours, movement, lighting and details. That's undoubtly a very strong characteristic of this series. The same goes for the music. Everything fits perfectly highlighting what's needed in particular scenes. The music alone is touching, not to mention its role in building atmosphere.\r\nThemain character is so young and raised in a village that you can't really expect much from her. She gets to speak out some noble, kind of cliche words, trying to say she relates to others' problems in a way. On the other hand you don't anticipate anything else but this. Not that bad. Still, she becomes quite annoying at times. It appears that freshly met people reveal thoughts or ideas she would never come up with. It's quite naive.\\n\\n\r\nThe idea for the series is interesting and captivating. It twists the rules of living and dying, aand of course raises a few questions how such reality can carry on. The disappearance of God is drawn as main theme but... it quickly gets lost, somehow.\\n\r\nBasically, we get to watch four short arcs. The first one is gorgeous, quite original, introduces the bizarre reality and of course the main character. Then it plays on emotions so much that I doubt anyone would stay untouched. I remember I was slightly worried it happened to be a short arc because things seemed quite rushed and it looked as if the case was closed for good.\\n\r\nThe second arc was good although not as great as the beginning. The idea seemed interesting but was executed worse.\\n\r\nThe middle of the show was the worst. Everything was quite boring, cliche, even senseless. I could see a lot of \"convinient\" solutions that left too much unexplained. A lot of characters was tossed in, which was unnecessary and only annoyed.\\n\r\nThe last arc was as beautiful as the first one, at least for me. I got engaged in the events and was nicely surprised with a plot twist. I'm glad the end appeared to be very good. I was afraid what to expect after the previous episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe story has got many plot holes. It becomes notorious and can disturb in watching pretty much. Many things stayed untold, unfolded. It simply feels... lacking. Especially that there isn't really any main plot but separate small ones. I suppose they would appear definitely more enjoyable if this anime were longer. It's just not enough episodes to cover all of the ideas.\\n\\n\r\nI love the opening episodes as well as the last events. This is why I feel a bit conflicted. I'm honestly disappointed how half of the show turned out. Aesthetics are on point, the story is far from that. However, I am glad I could see those great episodes, which I mentioned, because they were definitely worth it.",

            "content": "Sunday Without God, is a story-arc series formatted a little akin to Kino\u2019s Journey. There is no over-arching story, rather it follows our female lead, Ai, as she travels from one metaphorical town to another, and that\u2019s the beauty of this series. Each story arc is beautifully layered with symbolism and allegories showcasing the significance of the line between life and death in a nihilistic world. There\u2019s a lot to ponder about and a lot to relate back to the real world.  \r\nAi Astin is the perfect character to take us through the world of the series. Rather than simply acting as a catalyst,Sunday Without God does an incredible job fleshing out her personality and capturing that child-like innocence. Props to the dialogue, because whether Ai\u2019s disapprovingly questioning the morals the current world has adopted or claiming the obvious, everything that comes out of her mouth feels so real.\\n\\n\r\nBut with a brilliantly imaginative setting and a loveable female lead, Sunday Without God is not free from flaws. Its problems lie with its execution.\\n\\n\r\nRushed and hasty to get from arc to arc, emotional attachment is nearly void. A certain character\u2019s death put a nice, unexpected twist to the experience, but preceding scenes were too glazed over to evoke any emotions from me when the actual scene occurred.\\n\\n\r\nSide characters that accompany Ai on her journey are well-characterized but any development feels stilted, especially romantic relationships such as the one between Juliet and Scar.\\n\\n\r\nThis leads to another problem where yes, the ideas presented are brilliant but because of the rushed pacing, it\u2019s bound to leave many confused and inevitably frustrated. As much as I loved the setting, there are some major elements that the series pulls right out of its ass, even leaving me staring at the screen asking what the Hell I\u2019m suppose of make of it.\\n\\n\r\nThe series ends on a rather unsatisfactory note, putting a halt to everything after a rather so-so arc. A whimper rather than a bang, a final lasting impression didn\u2019t come through to me. Rather I was left irritated.\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, whose decision was it to set this for one cour instead of two?\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict:\\n\\n\r\nStory \u2013 Formatted in story-arcs and with no definite story was a good idea, but the execution is weak and rushed, causing a lack of the emotional punch that the series aims for\\n\\n\r\nCharacters \u2013 Ai Astin is a fantastic female lead, and the rest of the cast is likeable enough, but due to rushed pacing. Development and relationships feel stilted, causing emotional attachment to be nearly void.\\n\\n\r\nSetting \u2013 It\u2019s imaginative and immersive, chocked full of brilliant ideas and symbolism that work for the most part, but would have been far more effective with stronger execution.\\n\\n\r\nProduction Values \u2013 Solid throughout. The music is qutie nice, but the gorgeous background art is the strongest factor\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts: Most people dislike this series and for good reason. Its execution is weak and the series is rushed, but for me at least, it was still quite an enjoyable experience. \\n\\n\r\nRating: 7/10 (Good)",

I also really like its Opening and Closing songs, character designs, and complex universe.\r\nI enjoyed the first half of the anime a lot because it revolved around both Ai's mysterious status as a gravekeeper (the main character) and the issues in society that have arisen as a result of the fact that people can no longer die. \r\nHowever, the second half of the anime was not nearly as good as its first half. The story strayed away from its original premise (there was less about zombie people issues) and suffered from a bunchof plot holes. I personally didn't find the 'school' stuff to be interesting at all.\\n\\n\r\nI would still recommend this anime though. The graphics are just wayy too gorgeous. Though the last half of the anime was kinda shitty, I would definitely stick around for a sequel too see if the series shapens up.",

            "content": "This anime made emotional so I might be biased in writing a review.\r\nStory: 10/10\r\n          Though the story is a little bit complex it is OUTSTANDING! In the first episode the goal of the protagonist is to be the best gravekeeper in her little village. But because of some circumstances (it's a spoiler if I will tell what kind of circumstances however I'm sure that it's written in the plot that people in that village died because of one man.) she will leave the village and again another happening that will make her want tosave the world. So from that point the story will transform into an exciting adventure. I'm sure you're confused about what I'm trying to say but I swear that this anime can really make you emotional. To be honest, I cried in the first 3 episode.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10 \\n\\n\r\n        How I judge art in anime? CUTE GIRLS AND BOYS! If the boy is freaking handsome I'll quickly watch it. If the girl is so f*cking cute I'll immediately watch it. For me this is the basic criteria in judging this field. Admit it, sometimes you fell in love with anime characters even though they're fictional. \\n\\n\r\n      But I will be serious. The art is really nice. From looking at the cover it's really nice and beautiful and interesting. The cover makes you curios about the story. The cover makes you want to watch it or read it. Fine, fine there is the basis that you shouldn't judge a book from it's cover but we need to be realistic that we do judge the books by its cover. It's the picture that pulls our interest. \\n\\n\r\n      I think i focused too much on the cover so I want to make it clear. The art of the cover is as beautiful as the art of the entire anime. It's beautifully done.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\n     I don't have any complains about the sound. Since it's my first time writing a review in this format I really don't know how judge the sound however if we are talking about voice quality then I will no doubt give it a whooping ten. The voice is perfect although I can't tell if it's perfect or if people can easily understand them because I don't know Japanese. I rely on subs and I thank websites for providing them. But to make it clear, the sounds are awesome.\\n\\n\r\n     Opening and Ending songs. Usually I skip this part but once in a while listen to it, especially if it's really catches my attention. The songs in this anime really fit the story. The melody blends in. \\n\\n\r\n     Background songs. Marvelous. Incredible. The melody and the rhythm actually adds more impact to the scene. Very nice. It really enhances the scenes and give more feeling and emotion. I really blends in story plot.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\\n\r\n   Creative. Totally creative. This introduced lots of character with different personality. Although I will say that some of their personalities are really common. So why I gave it a 10? That's because every character has a story. Everyone carries a beautiful story that made their character really interesting. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\\n\r\n   I think that you can really tell how much I loved watching this anime. But I will still explain it. This anime is adventure and when it's adventure there are lots of exciting moments and scenes. Also, this anime has lots of surprises. You'll be surprise in some revelations and solved mysteries. It's a really complex story that was born from a single idea which \"God left the earth.\" Of course after hearing this you will hearing this you'll have lots of question. What will happen to the earth if the life giver is gone? People can't give birth. People can't die. When they are killed only their bodies die but their mind and memories remains. However their wisdom and memories will fade, they will rot and be no different to zombies or walking dead that's why gravekeepers are born to officially put their souls at ease. Realization: People DO die. Question: If they die what happens to their soul? Question: What happens if all people die. Question: What are gravekeepers actually? \\n\\n\r\n    You see there are millions of question however this anime flowed nicely . It answers the question step by step and were able to create a wonderful story. \\n\\n\r\n(I think you could also use this reason why i give the story a 10. xD)\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nI'm sorry for being lazy but I'm ending this short cause I think i pretty much explained why I give this anime a 10. For me it's pretty reasonable and fair but as review writer all this judgement are based from my opinion and taste in anime. I'll be honest in saying that this anime is not for everyone. Some might in boring but some may even consider it as a masterpiece. For me it's an OUTSTANDING piece. Please let me know what you think about this anime.",

            "content": "This series asks a question I am sure we have all thought about at one point or another when confronted with the death of a loved one: What if we could not die?\r\nAccording to Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi the answer isn't some idealistic fairy tale. Without death there is no new life or rebirth in this world and without that the world feels fairly empty and devoid of life. In fact, I felt death's importance was highlighted by this series because it gave a sense of closure and ending to a life.\r\nThe story is told as a series of connected arcs with very liberal useof time skips in between as we follow Ai and her companions journey through their world. This gives the story a somewhat disconnected feel which I did not appreciate, however this approach had the advantage of allowing more story to be told since the story often continues mid action and expects the viewer to more or less reason out what had happened in the interim between arcs. The arcs themselves I felt suffered from pacing issues, mainly they tried to do too much too quickly with introducing new characters and having them disappear from the story the very next episode, yet expecting their disappearance to somehow have an impact. Similarly, while we got to see much of the intriguing world that Ai lived in, the show only permitted glances at the different places and situations as to give the feeling that the environment was simply a storefront, appearing grander then they really were.\\n\\n\r\nWhere the series succeeded was really in presentation. The art was absolutely beautiful as any of the stills from the show can attest. I can only describe the environments shown throughout the show as surreal, almost like looking at the world as a painting rather than a picture because of the color choice. Character design is always hit or miss but I think the show had good character design with all the characters well differentiated and nothing too quirky as to distract the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nI liked the world and the context this series presented which made me strongly want to finish this series. During the first few episodes the series really delved into issues about death so I expected that theme to continue. However the series really just switched into \"adventure\" mode where the tough questions were left behind, I expect this was a good decision for DVD/BD sales but it would not have been my preference. Overall, I would have liked to see a longer series or a series that didn't try to cram so many adventures into only 13 episodes because the pacing really hurt my enjoyment of the show. \\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this show to anyone who likes adventure shows like Kino no Tabi where you get to travel to various parts of an intriguing world, encounter a problem and solve it within arcs.",

Although after watching the anime this doesn't seem to be the main concept of the story, instead we get 4 story arcs set over 12 episodes which I felt were a little rushed and ruined the emotional moments, but still the story was still good enough to keep me watching. \r\nArt 8/10\r\nThe art and animation of The Sunday Without God was beautiful, every scene was broughtto life by the vivid colours and the use of lighting and darkness to portray the different atmospheres of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\r\nThe OST was great and set the various scenes well from the sad parts to the uplifting parts.

            "content": "\u201cGod created the world on Monday.\r\nOn Tuesday, he drew the line between Order and Chaos.\r\nOn Wednesday, he arranged each and every number.\r\nOn Thursday, he permitted the ebb and flow of Time.\r\nOn Friday, God explored every nook and cranny of the world.\r\nOn Saturday, he rested.\r\nAnd on Sunday, God . . . forsook the world.\u201d\r\nBased on the light novels of the same name, Kaminai, short for \u201cKamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi,\u201d engaged many viewers with that first episode, by introducing us to a world without God. This isn\u2019t the first anime to touch on the \u201cGod\u201d subject, but it is one of the very few \u201cKamisama\u201d animeI\u2019ve actually seen, and very easily did I depict their similar unwillingness to deconstruct or delve deeper into the premise of their stories \u2013 thus, unappealing many viewers. However, I thought the premise was interesting enough to disregard those minor plot-holes.\\n\\n\r\nKaminai follows a young girl named Ai. Due to God\u2019s abandonment, the world can no longer die or reproduce. As a result, humanity turns to different means of living and new prejudices and mysteries are born. It isn\u2019t until Ai\u2019s encounter with a stranger named Hampnie Hambart, that she realizes her desire to \u201csave the world,\u201d which forces her on a journey to re-discover her own world.\\n\\n\r\nSo why did God abandon this world? There are many theories that the characters touch upon as to why God may have abandoned them, but the story doesn\u2019t dig any deeper into the question \u2013 it just sort of happened. Instead, it focuses more on deconstructing the new world that is born from it - via Ai\u2019s journey. The storyline can best be broken down into a series of arcs, as Ai attempts to help those she encounters throughout her journey \u2013 filling in the role as God\u2019s messenger, in a way. My favorite arc is probably the Ortus arc, but I believe each and every arc is enjoyable in its own way. Plus, the story touches on various concepts, like \u201cwishes\u201d and \u201cprayers,\u201d which I thought made the series really engaging. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, it had some pretty good production values. The series is animated by Madhouse and even though there is a surprisingly low amount of head tilts :P, there is a lot of attention to the background, which results in some very beautiful scenery. \\n\\n\r\nThe music was also really good. It made the atmosphere, for the most part. My only complaint would have to be the large amount of one-dimensional characters. I would have appreciated a little more depth in their character. Even Ai, who is supposed to be the main protagonist of the story, suffers from a lack of depth. Nevertheless, the best thing about Kaminai is its premise, which was my main reason for sticking around in the first place, so I can\u2019t complain much.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019d say the turning point for this series is episode three. You either love it or hate it, or find yourself crying by then.",

            "content": "Woah, seems I've got a bit of, um, dust in my eye here - WHY CAN'T I HOLD ALL THESE FEELS? Welcome one and all to another Waldy565 review, where today we look at Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi, roughly Sunday Without God. \r\nStory - The story does jump about, but is generally cohesive. Briefly: A girl called Ai is a being known as gravekeepers, who's job it is to find dead people. Her dad disappeared and her mum died (tragic, aye). Anyway, mysterious man slaughters everyone in her village (which I didn't quite understand, even at the end, but I'll get on that) - thisstranger is actually Ai's dad! Him and another stranger called Yuri then fight, then Ai chases after Hampne (Ai's father). They look for another gravekeeper called Scar. Hampne gets into another fight, but dies (despite being immortal... I'll give my spin on the symbolism after this) and meets again with Yuri.\\n\r\nYuri, Scar and Ai go on a trip, and Ai is kidnapped by the Goran Academys version of the FBI, as she now must attend a school. Here she meets Alice (a guy) and Dee, among others. Few roadtrips later, we find Alice, despite looking 16, is actually nearer 30 as he comes from an alternative dimension that has been stuck in a time loop. He then makes everyone in this loop realise there in  loop (thanks to Dee) and everyone escspes. Yes, that is OVERLY simplified.\\n\\n\r\nI think the director had a hard childhood, life, and maybe considered suicide. Death and mass slaughter is prominent in this, along with a lot of people who 'leave' (die) and I think this is symbolising death and mourning. OK, yes, it's kind of implied with GRAVEKEEPERS, but, especially the last 2 episodes, you'll definitely see the suicide and death links. Hate to compare it to something as it's a great show in it's own right, but the show does scream, if you hadn't seen it by now, ANGEL BEATS. 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nArt - Love the art. Standard CGI but just it's SO different to normal CGI use, it's not all crisp and \"moe\". It's all different and awesome. 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound - minimal, except at the end of each episode, a little, like,  sombre interlude played which didn't add much and the opening and ending songs aren't particularly memorable, but what I LOVED was the song in the last episode between Ai and Alice, but I'll say no more. It really did save the score from dipping, as you can see. 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - I've done brief bios in the story arc, but it's not what they do individually, it's what they do together. As said, they show the symbolism of mass murder, of mourning, of death, of the K\u00fcbler-Ross model (anger, denial, acceptance) - oh, there's a little optimism, but there's a general pessimistic undertone. But that in itself is the brillianceof the show. And this also acts as my overall enjoyment and conclusion of this review. Go in to this show as it is, and you'll find a quite generic show that then blooms into something you'll want to no more about and that you'll damn well nearly cry, if not you will cry, by the end (why do I watch such depressing stuff when I HAVE DEPRESSION. Ffs...) \\n\r\nGo into this while having watched Angel Beats and you'll have a nagging feeling this has all been done before, but watch this then Angel Beats and you'll get the same feeling. Overall, highly reccommended if you enjoy shows like Angel Beats (which I did) and a good recommendation overall into the insight of human pessimism. Thank you all and good night :)",

            "content": "Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi, or Sunday without god as it's english translation is, is a very strange anime featuring an incredibly original idea that would probably interest most people.  Unfortunately, just like its Sentai filmworks cousin Yumekui Merry, it falls very flat in its story category.  Let us begin.\r\nStory (7/10): God abandoned the world.  A very interesting concept where he has \"failed\" the world, and closed off heaven due to it being full, and giving everyone immortality.  Because god has gotten rid of the law of death, people are no longer able to die, have children, or grow older.  Thatbeing said, when people sustain a life-threatening injury, their bodies don't recover.  People in fact will grow corrupt and selfish as their bodies decay.  On top of that, to counter that, God created the gravekeepers, who will sense any \"deceased\" person, and attempt to bury them in order to make them at peace.  I'm not sure WHERE these people go, but screw it, it's anime.  The story follows a girl by the name of Ai, the cute little protagonist of the story.  Being born and raised in a sealed off village in the mountains, Ai is the town's gravekeeper, and is watched over by the villagers in the happy and wonderful world that she knows.  That is, until a man by the name of Hampnie Hambart comes in and kills all the villagers.  From then on, Ai sets off on a journey to save the world, whilst following the strange man that apparently murdered everyone she knew (logic).  Though this comes off as an IMMENSELY original idea, there are many flaws with its execution.  For starters, the story isn't about finding out why God abandoned the world.  Regardless of how much that would've improved that story, they don't do that.  In fact, what they do do, is show the audience, the effects of the abandonment.  The anime features 3 different main arcs, each with different characters that show a new situation and mystery to Ai.  While this is good on its own, it comes off to me as side stories while not focusing on the possible main plot point in the first place.  However, it does bounce back on the complex idea of \"alive\" and \"dead\" in the anime, and shows quite a lot of diversity.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8/10): Rather then talking about several characters in the anime like I usually do in my reviews, I'll be going over only one, as revealing the identities of the rest of the cast, would be considered as a huge spoiler.  Ai, as the main protagonist, is a 12 year old girl who is a gravekeeper.  As a bright, optimistic, and cheery person, she hosts an extremely child-like personality, that would probably warm anyone's heart if they saw it.  However, after the initial event of the first episode, she changes to the point that she wishes to save the world that God abandoned.  Pretty bold for a 12 year old.  As the story goes along, Ai doesn't actually change too much from what I can see, rather, she uses her experiences from without the story to combat the problem at hand.  She's definitely not your average little girl.  Apart from her, the rest of the main cast, including Hampnie Hambart, is shown to have a very large level of complexity which shows just how much time was spent into creating these characters.  Bottom line, I LIKE THEM!\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound (9/10): For art, you gotta hand it to them.  The art in this show is amazing.  The characters can be compared to those of Angel Beats! where all the characters feature a wide array of light colors and a sort of godly looking look in their design.  The backgrounds are very well detailed and I just love how good everything blends in with one another.  As for sound, it's awesome.  It's opening is amazing sounding with it's energetic opening showing the hope and despair that is in this new world.  It sounds wonderful, and I listened to it every time I watched the show.  As for the ending... I love it as well.  It gives a very somber sounding feeling that gives a sort of calming closing, as if you were given peace.  Overall, I loved them both and I wouldn't be surprised if anyone who decided to watch it after this review did too.  \\n\\n\r\nPersonal enjoyment (8/10): From the general synopsis of reading it, I thought that this was going to be one of the best things I've ever watched.  And I was right, mostly.  From an individual arc standpoint, the anime does really great in terms of executing the individual arcs with well done characters featured in each one, which get influenced by Ai in some way.  This is something I like.  I'd probably give it a 9/10.  However, looking at the anime as a whole, I don't see it as good. The transitions from one arc to another are very sudden and random, which feels kind of awkward.  On top of that, the story did feel a bit rushed at times, and there were some plot points that felt uneeded and very stupid.  There are 2 that I can think of in particular.   The ending itself was a bit confusing as well, and leaves a bit of a cliffhanger, seeing as how it was quite obvious that the anime still needed to explain what the hell just happened.  Aside that, there is still ONE moment that I would describe as my favorite/hated/heartfelt/story changing/important moment in this anime.  And that is, the end of episode 3.  For those of you who have seen it, you know what I'm talking about.  This scene in particular is where I think the anime took a bit of a nosedive (like SAO).  For me, I think it was both unnecessary, and necessary.  It was both stupid, and brilliant.  It was well done and- you get the point.  Above all, Sunday without God is good with its individual story arcs, its aesthetics, and its characters.  It falls flat on its overall cohesive story, and...that's about it really.  If you want to watch something original and not based off of archtypes, I would highly recommend this.",

            "content": "Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi (Sunday Without God)- This anime was a mixture of good and bad. It was a pleasant surprise but at the same time was  a lot of wasted potential.  It definitely would have been better with 24 episodes, but it was still a solid 7 despite its problems. \r\nLet's start with the good. The best aspects of this show are the art and the music. The artwork is gorgeous and has everything you could want in an animated work: vibrant colors, detailed scenery, fluid animation, realistic character designs, and a variety of environments. \r\nThe music is just as good asthe art in terms of how much of an impact it has on the show. The ambient music is perfect and adds a surreal feel to almost every scene. It really makes this already unique world feel even more unique. Both the OP and ED are also very good, with the ED being one of my favorites. \\n\\n\r\n The world that is built in this series is by far one of the most interesting worlds I've seen in awhile. It's a mixture of post-apocalyptic with both modern and medieval architecture, both living and dead, and different races - human and gravekeeper, along with the power that wish fulfillment can bring in a world essentially devoid of rules. The way everything flows cohesively together in this world abandoned by God is really nice to see and it's one of the most unique creations I can think of. \\n\\n\r\nThe downside of this show is that it wasn't able to fully capitalize on the world it had to work with. Things felt rushed, the world wasn't explored to the capacity many people would have liked to see, and the story itself suffered from poor writing and poor characters. \\n\r\nThe story has 4 important arcs: Valley of Death, City of the Dead, Goran Academy, and Class 3-4, in the order they take place in. The first 2 arcs were very good. They did a good job introducing the viewer to this fascinating world and explaining how it operates now that God is no longer around to oversee its happenings. The City of the Dead arc is especially good at offering more insight into the world in both lore and environment. The Goran Academy arc is by far the lowest point in the series. Thankfully it's only 2 episodes long, but those 2 episodes were painfully uninteresting compared to the rest of the series. It's really immersion breaking- that's the best way to describe it. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the Goran Academy arc, the characters in the show are another weak point. Too many characters are introduced and flung to the side shortly thereafter, and the mainstay characters suffer because of it due to their screen time being interfered with. The Goran Academy arc is the worst of this dilemma, with a plethora of characters being thrown aside as soon as the arc ended without there being any attempt to develop them at all. The worst part is that the writing tries to force drama that isn't there because, well.. Nobody cares about these characters. \\n\r\nThe main cast is honestly not that bad- Hambart and Alice in particular are very interesting characters with strong personalities. Ai is a bit of a hit-and-miss. She's a likeable character overall and is less annoying than your typical young female lead, but she still suffers from some of the same tropes that you would expect (being overly naive, being overly stubborn, and showing an alarming lack of awareness in some situations). \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Sunday Without God is worth a watch. Despite the Goran Academy arc in the middle and an overall weak cast of characters, the rest of the arcs (which are all very good) and the few good characters are not overshadowed. The superb sound and visuals do a lot for strengthening the show as well. \\n\r\nSunday Without God is not a bad show by any means, it's just not as good as it could have been. I still really enjoyed it, and I'm sure any fan of the Mystery genre or anybody looking for a unique world (which is rare to find these days) will enjoy it as well. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10 (Great and very interesting world but average writing overall)\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nCharacter 5: (Some good characters but just way too many irrelevant ones)\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7",

So... only read it if you have already completed this series.\r\nDon't know what i was expecting when i started watching this. I did read its description before watching though, it seemed like something of a fantasy with little bit drama. It was cute until that unexpected and heart tearing moment in episode 3. I was like a WTH moment!! and disappointing and unexpected. The sole purpose i started watching this damn thing was because i wanted to see how the father/daughter relationship goes after being reunited. But that was for a very short time. Whythe heck he had to be dead in the in very early episode. I thought that i won't be able to watch anymore and the same happened, i couldn't. I had no idea what to expect out of it anymore.\\n\r\nMaybe i was expecting too much of it.\\n\\n\r\nIt had a great potential until her father awakens as living dead. This anime could've become a masterpiece yet failed deeply. Atleast for me.\\n\\n\r\nYou may like it or not it depends on you. Everyone has a different prospective after all.\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\r\nStory 5/10\\n\r\nCharacter 6/10\\n\r\nOverall 4/10",

I can say I genuinely cared for all the major characters, each have their own flaw but they all have a genuine good side -none of that stereotypical evil villain rubbish here.\\n\\n\r\n[ART:9]\\n\r\nBeautiful, just stunning the designs, the flow, the effects. Would go for a 10 but then it would have to match or top the series \"K\"\\n\\n\r\n[SOUND:9]\\n\r\nVoice actors are perfect for the roles",

This main protagonist is given special job and special power that only the chosen one by gods are able to carry out . However , as she is still about five years old still , she did not know much and only started exploring the world after his dad came rescue her. As she is cute but weak , it makesone want to cheer for her the entire series for her to become stronger xd . Obviously that is not the point in the story (for her to become stronger.) The point of the story is just that these certain people \"gravekeepers\" are supposed to do their jobs as selected by the gods to bury dead people. Because humans made a wish to the god on sunday and they stopped dying . When humans stopped dying , their birth rate also stopped. This story will just be like the girl's and her comrades adventure to different places meeting different people and having experiences xd If you have doubts how good ........\\n\\n\\n\r\n~go watch~",

            "content": "This visually beautiful anime is based on a fascinating concept, but ultimately lets down its ambitious premise.\r\nTHIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS\r\nKaminai is about the value of an individual life and what it truly means to live or die. Will removing death and birth from human experience make life more or less vital? In the first half of the series, the show manages to subvert or avoid many anime clich\u00e9s; characters die unexpectedly, underlying the show's message that life's brevity is what gives it meaning. Lost loves are really lost, forever. People make difficult, complicated decisions in a world that has no clear sense of right orwrong.\\n\\n\r\nStructurally, the show portrays our protagonist, Ai, meeting series of characters being trapped in unbearable worlds: worlds their families or friends create, worlds that strangers create, and worlds of their own creation. Each of these story arcs are resolved when characters choose to either break free of their bonds or to embrace the cage they have come to live in by acknowledging and accepting it. Along the way we meet strange and unique people and the equally unique landscapes they inhabit: a necropolis watched over by a goddess of death, a character who is the joint child of five people, an emotionless extra-human being who is made bedridden by the cry of an unknown child. Moments of humor and fun character interactions bring just the right amount of levity to keep things floating along, not quite getting bogged down in the seriousness of the moment, but never forgetting that the stakes are deadly.\\n\\n\r\nKaminai's world-building is fantastic. The sense of society's stagnation and decay is palpable as we visit location after location of people, alive and dead, struggling to find meaning in lives devoid of both hope for the future and longing for the past.\\n\\n\r\nBest of all, the protagonist's optimistic, innocent attitude is shown to be naive in a grim and brutal world. This lends her a feeling of vulnerability and saves her from being an unwatchable 'genki Mary Sue' type. Ai gives us many uplifting speeches about the power of wishes and the value of loving yourself, sure, but we also get to see her being kicked wholeheartedly off of a bridge and discovering that her early life was a nightmarish lie perpetrated at the hands of those she loved most.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, as Kaminai progresses, we find ourselves trapped along with the characters: the main story is never resolved, and the show's episodic story arcs become less and less impactful. Ai's quest to save the world never comes to fruition. Nor does she set aside her quest in a deliberate attempt to live life to the fullest. Instead, her special abilities and past are forgotten about as the main plot is sidelined by not one but two thinly veiled plot contrivances to get her into a schoolgirl uniform. \\n\\n\r\nFirst, the unique road trip story about a world with no death is turned into a hackneyed 'high school for gifted youngsters' tale for no reason. Then, Ai's quest is sidelined again for her to dote on a basketball-playing schoolboy whose Groundhog-Day-style story arc is played more for drama than to explore either the show's setting or explore its central themes. The show ends with a character being revived from the dead as a result of literal wish fulfillment-- this wouldn't be out of place in a normal anime with supernatural themes, but Kaminai takes great pains to show us the evil of such thinking. In fact, wishing to avoid the character's death is what caused the problem in the first place. Not to mention that any emotional impact stemming from his sacrifice is gone.\\n\\n\r\nKamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi is still worth watching, despite its unsatisfying ending. The characters are likeable, the world is interesting, and the visuals are beautiful. Earlier episodes make great use of digital animation during crowd scenes to make the show feel rich and, ironically, full of life. Top notch voice-acting and a decent soundtrack support the show as well. For the anime fan in search of a cute protagonist and something to pull your heartstrings and maybe give you a moment of reflection about what it means to break free of the prison your own worldview, you could do a lot worse.",

            "content": "Kami-sama no Inai Nichiyoubi is one anime that immediately caught my eye. The description was intriguing and the art was pretty good, and so, I immediately started watching. \r\nStory:\r\nIf I had to describe it in one sentence, it would be: it didn't live up to what it could be. This pretty much stems from the story. At first glance, the premise shows so much promise. A world where \"God\" abandoned the world, and therefore no one can die or give birth. From here, we have our protagonist, Ai, have everyone in her village slaughtered and then subsequently go on an adventure to save the world.\\n\\n\r\nHere's the first problem: what exactly is she doing? \"If God abandoned this world... then I'll save it,\" is what she says, but it's never really clear /how/ she's going to achieve it. In fact, there are so many side stories and deviations from the main story that we never actually get to it. For a 12 episode anime, the pacing is pretty terrible. It jumps from side story to side story with little transition. \\n\\n\r\nSo, while the stories were interesting in their own right, we never actually get to the point, which is rather annoying. \\n\\n\r\nThe second problem stems from the premise. We're told \"God\" is the one who abandoned this world, and then later discover that it might not even be true. So is there even a God? If there isn't, then how in the world did the world become like that?    \\n\\n\r\nIt's questions like these where the answer is \"that's just how it is\" that makes the storytelling so bad. There are so many little things that don't make sense either, and so many plot holes that are left unresolved.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art was beautiful, I loved it! The scenery was detailed and calming, and there are some really nice shots of the world they live in. The character designs were really nice too - they were all pretty unique. I especially loved the design for Humpnie Humbert. \\n\\n\r\nThere were some shots of the characters where I thought their hair was clunky and/weird. This especially applied to Alice/Alis, who I sometimes thought had way too much hair for his character. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nBoth the opening and the ending sounds suited the anime well. They were calming and the lyrics just matched perfectly. There were soothing OST's that went with the tone, and so, I have no complaints in this department.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nI really liked them, even in the short time that they were here. Although, that being said, I don't think enough of them got good characterizations, because the \"plot\" simply moved too fast past them to be sure. In the anime, There were about three or four arcs, and each had their own cast of characters. With the anime being as long as it is, that means about 2/3 episodes for each of those characters in that arc before it moves it. \\n\\n\r\nAnd so, there wasn't nearly enough characterization to be done on them. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I'm really mad at is Humpnie Humbert. Being in the description and the cover art, I thought he was going to be important. Turns out, I was wrong. I really liked him as well, and he has such a unique personality that I wanted to see him more. \\n\\n\r\nTalk about misleading. And disappointing. \\n\\n\r\nOne other thing before I close this review is the language in the anime. It's so... inconsistent. Even their names seems to be very odd mix of Japanese, French, and Russian, I think. And the written language is French. I don't know what they were trying to do here, but I think they should've just stuck to one language. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "\"An immortal always desires one thing: a way to die.\"\r\nHampnie Hambart (Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi)\r\nThis quote itself can summarize a lot about this anime. It's all about a new world, a world without god, and the changes this situation brings. We get to see despair, blood and death but, surprisingly we also get to see lots of smiles, normality and happiness. It seems that god doesn't make that much of a difference in the world, or does it?\r\nI think it takes some courage to bring up such a delicate and complicated theme to an anime.\r\n\"Heaven and Hell are too crowded. It won\u2019t be long beforethis world is, too. Ah, I have failed.\"\\n\r\nGod (Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi) \\n\\n\r\nWell, but they made it and succeeded. Such an unique plot gets you really interested and you will find yourself asking: \"What now?\", \"What can they do now?\".\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is divided into 4 arcs and it's kinda episodic. I mean, each arc is about something that, then, is kinda forgotten and thrown away so, if you don't like this factor I guess you won't enjoy it as much as I did. \\n\r\nAlso, the art is really appealing and suits the ambience in which the anime occurs. Oh, and the music/soundtrack is something else: besides being awesome, it has a perfect timing and suits the scenes perfectly.\\n\r\nAs for the characters, considering that this is a 12 episode anime, I think they made a good job: some of the characters are really unique like Hampnie Hambart and Alice. The only think they lack is screen time 'cause we see them coming and going really fast and that leaves you sad because they were really charismatic.\\n\r\nAlso, this anime is really emotional and that's where it excels. \\n\r\nThe story flows swiftly but calmy and you don't have that feeling that something is being skipped or rushed. And that's really good in an anime as little as Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi.\\n\r\nWell, I enjoyed this anime and it made me really happy.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading :D",

            "content": "I have shows that I like to call 'Songbird Shows', which are shows that I decide to watch at some point or another for solely one reason: The Opening theme. Whether I hear it on YouTube or a friends shows it to me, these shows lure me into watching the whole deal simply because I love the opening theme. And with a show like 'Sunday Without God', you can't blame me for that being the reason I decide to watch because, frankly, there's not much else going for this show.\r\nBefore I even go into the plot, I need to get something off my chest:\r\nWHERE/WHEN THEHECK DOES THIS SHOW TAKE PLACE?!\\n\r\nSeriously. Everyone wear clothing that looks like it's from the 1800's, yet there are fully functioning industrialized cities (as seen in the special episode), and the main characters spend half the show in a van. Is this some special world that's just very similar to Earth or is it a far off country buried in the mountains in Europe? I have no idea, and I really wish the show had taken the time to explain that small detail.\\n\\n\r\nAhem, where was I?\\n\\n\r\nSo heaven gets crowded and God decides not to let people in anymore. This in turn means no one can die anymore, they simply grow old rot, and become zombie-like things. However, the solution to this problem is that God sent Gravekeepers into the world, people with the ability to bury the dead and have them stay dead. Where they go after they're buried is also not full explained, because, if we remember here, heaven is full. A young Gravekeeper named Ai ends up getting caught up in a big event in which her whole town is altered and she is forced to leave with a strange man. She then decides she is going to somehow save the world from the purgatory God has made of it. It's really is an interesting plot and concept, but it's executed really poorly. Not to say that the story is bad, nor are the individual arcs (the last one in particular was very well-done) but there are so many unanswered questions and concepts that get thrown aside because the plot wants to work, and at times, it really doesn't.\\n\\n\r\nAi is a boring 'save-everyone' hero who always wins, even when she loses. Humpnie is a great character, but is hardly in the show. Yuri is the wanna-be father figure. Scar is the emotionless one that develops emotions. Siiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiigh It's boring guys. All your great characters are there for such a small amount of time before you move on with your boring leads again. I loved Humpnie. I loved Kiriko and Ulla. I LOVED Alis and Dee. But the show would rather show me Ai doing...nothing than show me interesting characters for more than one arc. If the show had another season and we got to see more of these characters, it'd be no problem at all. it would also give Ai a chance to grow and Yuri and Scar would get more screen time than the occasional 'check-in'. Characters are not awful or even bad, they're just standard.\\n\\n\r\nThe production of animation in this show is like a weaker version of No Game No Life. that show had really bright, vivid colors that lent themselves to the excessive bloom lighting and graphical effects. Sunday Without God is not nearly colorful or vivid enough for that and it makes that animation feel forced on the viewer. Like characters, it's not a bad aspect of the show, but it's trying too hard to be special.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, finally something to praise. The opening and ending themes in this show are phenomenal. heck, even background music is pretty darn good. But this is a 'Songbird Show' for a reason. The theme is different from any other song I've heard and the lyrics convey the main point of the show very well. The ending theme is also really beautiful, though it took me a while to get a feeling for.\\n\\n\r\nSunday Without God is not a bad show. It's a completely decent show by all means. But for me, the things it lacked took away too much from what it had. Even the things it had were taken away by the show itself that focused too much on moving on to the next big thing rather than cherish w=the good aspects it had for any given moment in time. I enjoyed the show, but not a whole lot.\\n\\n\r\nPositives:\\n\r\n+The opening and ending theme\\n\r\n+The opening and ending theme\\n\r\n+The side characters\\n\r\n+Decent animation\\n\r\n+The opening and ending theme\\n\\n\r\nNegatives:\\n\r\n-The main character\\n\r\n-The side characters getting the boot every 3 episodes\\n\r\n-Ending was abrupt and detracted from everything building up to it\\n\r\n-Significant details are simply not explained well at all\\n\\n\r\nSunday Without God is nowhere near the worst show I have seen (That belongs to like Death Note or something.....look, the ending was awful, get over it). However, it's certainly not that great of a show. If it sounds like it'll intrigue you, go for it, but for me, everything was standard and everything that stood out took a side seat to the bland things the show brought to the table.",

            "content": "Imagine a world where there is no death, a world where no one is no longer born, a would where you cannot die and must continue to roam around until a specialised agent of God (A Gravekeeper) can put you to sleep (death)... That is The Sunday Without God summed up. This was quite a surprising anime to find as I didn't have that high expectation for it, but boy did it surprise.\r\nStory: 10\r\nI really, really enjoyed this story, particularly for its uniqueness. The whole idea of this, as well as the issues raised about death and family and community that are raised throughout theanime, it is just simply amazing for them to come up with an idea like this. The story follows the main character who is a young girl named Ai Astin and her travels around the region. The story is really split into 2 parts, with the first part focusing on the city of Ortus, one where you must be dead to live in, and the second part following Alis Colour and the attempts to free a society trapped in time, both of which are very enjoyable to watch and learn more about.\\n\\n\r\nArt + Sound: 9\\n\r\nThe artwork for this anime was splendidly done. The soundtrack was very good as well, appropriately setting the mood for scenes and creating the right sort of emotions within the audience.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\nAi Astin is the main character. She is a bright, young, exuberant girl who wishes to travel around and save the world. She is a very likeable character as well, however has nothing major that makes her stand out and be truly memorable. She mainly travels around with a gravekeeper named Scar whose personality is quite bland, and Julie Sakuma Dmitriyevich who takes on the role of a father figure. The only other mentionable character would be Alis Colour who comes in during the second half. He is actually quite a mysterious character who has an emotional past and on the whole is someone who you can relate to; strong, determined and quite reserved to those around him.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment Overall: 9\\n\r\nThis anime was really something to see, and caught me by surprise to see something so splendid come out. It continually leads you down and path and makes you want more out of it as you progress, wanting to find out more about the world and how it functions and what could possible happen. On the whole I liked it and recommend it for those who are after something unique.",

            "content": "At first, what keeps me watching this anime was only because of 2 reasons. One is the opening song which is very good(IMO), the OP song gives me the same feeling and somehow it has the same style as the OP of Fate Zero. Then the second is its similarity to the popular JRPG 10years(or more) ago which is Final Fantasy X(my favorite rpg). Yes, the protagonist(Ai) has atleast 2 similarities with Yuna(FFX). They both have a mixed race and they both sends off the dead to where they should belong.\r\nSo while watching this anime I really don't have any expectations at all. But aftermaybe 3 or 4 episodes, this anime really pull off something very good, that you might say WOW(or not wow cause you might cry). So if you're skeptic about this anime, I recommend you to watch atleast 4 episodes before you decide to continue or drop this anime.\\n\\n\r\nNow, analyzing the story and plot. This anime revolves around Ai's(protagonist) journey to a world that was believed to be abandoned by GOD. So, given that kind of world, this anime will present you many discoveries,irregularities and/or mysteries about the imbalanced world(since God is the one who maintains balance to this world). If we look deeper to the 12 episodes, we can divide it to maybe 5 arcs but imo there are 3 major arcs in this anime, as the other episodes/arc were used to give character introduction and character background/development(some sort of a filler). I'll call the first arc as the \"Hampnie Hambart Arc\", I can describe this as SURPRISINGLY and EMOTIONALLY GREAT. I believe this arc was the best arc of the series even though you might feel it was kinda fast paced. This arc will leave you a solid basis to the totallity of the series. The second arc is the Ortus Arc. Though this arc was a level below the first arc, I can still say it was very good. This arc will hold your interest through presenting a very dark world, its culture and its secrets. This arc was a change of pace from an emotional arc(1st arc) to a discovery arc. The last arc would be the \"Alice Color Arc\". This arc was almost at the same level as the 1st arc. It has an established characters since they were introduced on the latter episodes. The events in this arc was kinda predictable but still it has a very great twist that defined this arc. Summing up everything, watching this anime was a great experience, the setting and plot was refreshing and unique. Though it has many cliches and predictable scenes, the fantasy world and the twists made up for it.\\n\\n\r\nSo my overall rating would be 9 which means this anime was really GREAT. I would recommend it to those who watch anime of various genre but not to those who watches only shonen anime. That's it. That concludes my review.\\n\\n\r\nEven though I think this anime was GREAT, I will still point out some cons. But be reminded that these lines were very opinionated and might contain some spoiler. Please don't read if you don't want to be spoiled.\\n\r\ncons\\n\r\n-The protagonist solves matured issues even though she's only a child who lived on an isolated village, and doesn't know anything about outside the village.\\n\r\n-The ending was just an end of an arc. The ending doesn't conclude anything about the main plot(world abandoned by God). But on an optimistic view -- Yey.. it means there's still a possible season 2.\\n\r\n-For me the humor was kinda flat. Its kinda awkward to insert humor in between serious parts/conversations.\\n\\n\r\nThat's all.\\n\r\nThank you for reading.",

            "content": "So what would happen if God really did give up on us? \r\nWhilst scrolling through the many reviews on this site, I found this little gem. \r\nI was completely unaware of what to expect and just wow... I will never regret my decision to watch this anime. \r\nI recommend this anime to anyone with a love for post apocalyptic/ zombie/ philosophical interests in life value and meaning and death. Or those who need a change of pace. \r\nFor the past month I have skimmed through many titles and this is one of the first I simply needed to review. \r\nThis anime is a diamond inthe rough, there were points in the anime where I was unsure where the plot would end up. And there are also many areas I would of love to have seen expanded. This anime is too short. I loved it too pieces and the pace as nice but there are some storylines and scenarios which could've been longer.\\n\r\nRighty no spoilers here I hope.\\n\r\nStory - This is one storyline which will keep you guessing until the end. This is an anime which decided ... Dam this I want to be different. Its a daring topic to chose  and the story was pulled of very well. The general storyline revolves around the idea no one can die or be born and God has given up on the world. From this starting point, the anime explores many aspects of what a world would be like if this was the case.  I gave this a 9 because of the areas I felt needed expanding. But that is more a personal reason. \\n\r\nArt - This is a very colourful and well drawn anime, I personally loved the art style and colour. Tick in the box from me here. \\n\r\nSound - I loved the opener and the ending song, throughout the anime there was a piano piece playing. Basically a modulation of variations of the main theme. I like piano so this ticked all the right boxes. \\n\r\nCharacter - I felt most of the characters back stories and development was carried out in a very nice way. We see our main character Ai develop in an interesting way as she responds to the scenarios around her. I think this was carried out nicely and I found myself crying and really feeling for many of them. The writers really did do a good job on making you relate and feel for the characters. However it only got a 9 due to some areas again needing a tiny bit more expansion to help develop some of the other character stories.  \\n\r\nEach character is unique, there will be someone who you find yourself supporting. Due to such a complex topic there may even be times you find yourself thinking due to what they say and how they respond.\\n\r\nEnjoyment - Full marks from me, I am so glad to have found this and hope that others also give this anime the attention it deserves. Maybe take a break from your slice of lives ? And try something a bit more paced? \\n\r\nOverall - For anyone who loves a good storyline, art, philosophy or simply a good anime, I think this anime deserves a place on your plan to watch list. Or better still...watch this anime =D",

People can't die, can't reproduce... Are the dead people, who are still living btw, not zombies? They try their hardest not to become rotting corpses. But the only way for them to truly \"die\" is to be buried by an actual Gravedigger.

            "content": "I had been looking forward to the day I watched Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi. Now that I've seen it, I wish I had stopped at Episode 6. The story premise is great, as are the first six episodes, but after that it all falls apart. The anime is told in miniature arcs, each of which are 3 episodes long (although the arc from episodes 7-9 is a bit disjointed, while also being the weakest). \r\nThe first arc introduces the main characters, the premise for the world's state, and sets up a grand adventure. Out of all the arcs, it is probably the best and, inmy opinion, they should have just expanded the first arc's plot into a 12-episode anime and had done with it, having the start of the cast's grand adventure as the conclusion and a premise for a potential sequel.\\n\\n\r\nThe second arc is the first step on the adventure that the first arc sets up. It further expands the original world premise of the how the living, dead, and gravekeepers all interact, and does so with a moving tale and a cast of intriguing characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe third and fourth arcs, however, come out of left field. The third suddenly changes the setting to that of a stereotypical school anime, all while introducing a needlessly large cast of characters, most of whom are quickly thrown away after two episodes, and all of whom receive meager development. The fourth arc takes the remaining characters that were introduced in the third arc and develops them. However, in their attempt to do so, the writer(s) end up branching too far from the foundation of the world's backstory, making the entire arc feel like it has nothing to do with the world of Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi in the first place. Throughout the third and fourth arcs, some of the major supporting characters are left by the wayside in exchange for a poor attempt at connecting the audience with a new supporting cast.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, this anime is bipolar. The first half deserves its relatively high average rating on MAL. The second half, I couldn't rate above a 3 in good conscience. Therefore, I'm plunking it on a 5/10 - somewhere in between. The great balances out the bad to create an average score.",

            "content": "*I included as few spoilers as possible\r\nThere are few anime who, after I finish watching them, I have to scratch my head. Even fewer make me simultaneously want to review the story itself and post it online. Sunday Without God is one of those irksome shows.\r\nStory 4 (This show really is a cute girl doing cute things)\r\nI picked this series up because its premise sounded amazing. I am a sucker for religiously-inclined series, and this one seemed to fit the bill perfectly. The show's two opening arcs were nothing short of amazing, if a bit campy. The series explained the setting while also bringing tolight the conflicting views of safety and security in this new world, and how each person seeks to attain them. It was beautifully done with the only issue being the complete campy-ness of everything. This show is slice of life, make no mistake, it is not extremely dark like the opening or themes would have you believe. \\n\\n\r\nMy problem comes in two forms; one is the tone, and the other is the ending. The tone of this, as I said is very slice of life, but its concept is much less than so. The slice of life aspect of this show ruins many of the themes because it is like the show itself is not taking itself seriously. I could not tell who this story is for. The people who like slice-of-life will be off-put by the random and graphic violence, but those who like darker themes will be put off by the storytelling that is reminiscent of bubblegum, cotton candy, and rainbows. Maybe there is someone out thee who this show is perfect for, but the tone, to me especially, seemed way too varied to really take it seriously.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending... is another matter. This is one of those shows where everything literally stops mid-story without any resolution. Unlike similar shows such as Kino's Journey, the series doesn't even give you any final words. It. Just. Stops. This would be okay, if the viewer were not left with a dozen questions. The show does not explain the nature of the wishes God gives the world or how what happened at the end of the final episode, even happened. I could have ignored the tonal shifts, but the horrible ending and the fact that the final two arcs were so similar to one another (same settings and themes) dragged this score down at least 3 points.\\n\\n\r\nOne last thing to note is its poor execution of Chekhov's gun. I can't give specifics, but there are events and things that happen that do not come up again, even though a big deal was made of them to begin with. It happened more than six times in this series, and really brought down the overall message, as well as the characters.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork in this is gorgeous, in that hyper stylized moe kind of way. I don't have many complaints save for the fact that there were awful uses of CG and the characters often did not quite blend with the gorgeous backgrounds provided. Otherwise, I thought it was great.\\n\\n\r\nSound 6\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is usually really good. The opening sequence is ear-catching with its swelling choir and snippets of English phrases and the ending is one of my favorites of all time. But other than those two, nothing really stands out. None of it is bad, but it's not great either. The music is also not very versatile. It tells you exactly how to feel and when to feel it- with no interpretation left to the viewer. If it's sad, you're supposed to be curled up into the fetal position bawling. If it's happy, you're supposed to be skipping and laughing. Etc. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 5\\n\\n\r\nSunday Without God is a mixed bag when it comes to its characters. Sure each of them have well-thought out motivations and solid interactions between one another, but those interactions and motivations do not match up most of the time. A character's backstory will be presented and a few personality quirks alongside that, then, the character just goes off and does random things that have nothing to do with their personality in the first place. I'm talking about the fact that the village that raised our main character is brutally murdered, and what does she (the caring and loyal Ai) do? She of course goes with the man who killed her village. Makes perfect sense! There are numerous instances of this, and it got very annoying very quickly.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest travesty to the characters is that they all act so happy all the time. I get that the main character is that way, I will not complain there. But many of the others are just happy for happiness' sake. It's unreasonable to think that in a post-apocalyptic future that no one would be experiencing extreme depression or despair- that's just not possible. This campy feel added with the slice of life tone, just ruins much of the interactions of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 5\\n\r\nOverall 6\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I don't regret purchasing this series. It's not terrible. It has many very touching moments and the colors and animation are very pleasing to the eye. I just didn't like it from a technical standpoint. Despite my negativity, this show is not awful. It definitely has some problems in it, but for what it is, it's not bad. I just hoped for more out of a series with such amazing animation, a great premise, and an opening sequence that was inventive. \\n\\n\\n",
