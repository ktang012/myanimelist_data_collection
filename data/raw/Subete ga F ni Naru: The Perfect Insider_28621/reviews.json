            "content": "It\u2019s not easy to watch a show like \u201cThe Perfect Insider\u201d. Generally speaking, the show is about mystery and in this case involves murder. It\u2019s something that can be a sensitive topic as we learn more about the circumstances. And given the mystery aspect of the show, it\u2019s the narratives that captures the essence of story. Really though, what is The Perfect Insider? \r\nSubete ga F ni Naru (also more commonly known as The Perfect Insider) is based on a Japanese mystery novel written in 1996 by Hiroshi Mori. Produced by A-1 Pictures, the show is symbolic for how mystery can be so\u2026mysterious. The settingtakes place on a remote island and begins when Souhei Saikawa, an associate professor of National Nagono University, goes on a vacation there. During his vacation, he is also accompanied by 1st year student, Moe Nishinosono. What started out as an ordinary trip turns bizarre when a mysterious corpse shows up at the lab. At the same time, it also became well known that a woman named Shiki Magata lives there. As one of the most mysterious characters in the show, she has literally lived in a laboratory for the past 15 years. Can you imagine that? Trapping themselves like a rat in a box hardly sounds like a paradise. For someone like Magata, there\u2019s also a dark past that involves the parricide of her parents. It\u2019s the establishment of these three characters that makes The Perfect Insider a dark and grimy tale.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s a very talky show. The first episode has an immense amount of philosophical vibe that follows with its heavy dialogues. The character interactions between Moe/Magata and Moe/Souhei can be described as cryptic. There\u2019s some lighthearted humor as well but mostly follow a suit of dark comedy. When they reach the island, there\u2019s also more of an experimental feeling as if there\u2019s something that\u2019s hidden there. It\u2019s not long before they discover the grim truth there. What the show also concentrates a bit on is the background story of Shiki Magata. Obviously, she isn\u2019t a normal woman by the way she talks or behaves. The bits of past we see implies that she is an unstable child although her actions are difficult to decipher because of her personality. [spoiler]This includes her involvement with the death of her parents as well as the perverse relationship she forges with her uncle.[/spoiler] I think at some point, viewers may find it unsettling with what they witness. And that\u2019s no surprise either considering how much we learn that Magata is far from normal.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the series, there are many clues that has connections with the murder case. It\u2019s also apparent that some of the clues are presented through intentional means. One of the most prominent is a message called \u2018Everything Becomes F\u2019, which is also synonymous with the series\u2019 alternate title. What\u2019s more about the clues is that they are all seems to be related to Shiki Magata. What I find the show intriguing is how each episode\u2019s performance triggers events that correlates with one another. Even the episode titles has some sort of meaning or is symbolic with the storytelling. Some sensitive topics are used as plot devices and while can be unsettling is important to establish Magata\u2019s character. On a weaker note, the show has a slow pacing, one that I think can really test the patience of viewers. Furthermore, the story is structured in a way that explores both Moe and Magata in almost parallel ways. As the story progresses, we also learn a bit more about Moe as well. While her personality is not similar to Magata or Souhei, something suggests that her past isn\u2019t as bright as some people have hoped.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character interactions of the show is expressed by the building tension and relations one draws from another. Moe\u2019s conversation with Souhei can be interpreted from many angles but it\u2019s obvious that he shows a great deal of bizarre interest in Magata. Moe\u2019s interest with Souhei also crafts a bizarre relationship angle as Magata shows unusual interest in Moe. It\u2019s a really weird way of presenting the story and I\u2019d have to advise to watch the show with an open mind. Not just because of the main characters but also for some of the more mature and sensitive topics. Otherwise, this is probably a show that is not worth the investment especially considering how talkative it is. There\u2019s still also some minor comedy although mostly is far eclipsed by the thrilling feeling of its mystery.\\n\\n\r\nFor a mystery show, it also invests a decent amount of time with its unusual artwork. There\u2019s a hollow feeling that anyone can draw from its backgrounds. Most characters are also designed to look simple without unusual features. Well, that is until you see Makata Shiki. Additionally, the show portrays its mystery with symbolism and disorder. The clues translates into a more detailed form of analysis such as the message Magata left behind or more prominent features Moe herself discovers later on in the show. To put it simply, artwork is unorthodox but also stylistically fitting for a show like this.\\n\\n\r\nI have to admit a bit, the soundtrack is surprisingly impressive. From the unusual execution of the OP song (that features rotoscope done effectively) to the thrilling atmosphere, each episode offers what mystery should be. More intensified scenes are also adapted with quietness to add on more to the thrilling suspense. In addition, character voice mannerisms has a profound tone of philosophy behind them. In particular, Souhei speaks with intelligence and purpose and that\u2019s something I find quite compelling. Unfortunately, this doesn\u2019t seem to apply to Moe as she can be legitimately frustrating to watch with someone of her personality. And of course, there\u2019s Magata. Her conversation portrayed in the show through that near-sinister like voice really can feel mysterious.\\n\\n\r\nThe Perfect Insider is a show with some unique dynamics even in the mystery genre. From disturbing plot devices to insightful conversations, it\u2019s a series that goes beyond just a simple murder case. It becomes complex with its dark themes, the riveting style of the storytelling, and heavy characterization. The first three episodes will probably be a make or break for most viewers. But if you manage to stay, it\u2019ll be a thrilling ride that is not short of perfect.\\n",

            "content": "The Perfect Insider is what I would like to call the first 'proper' mystery anime I've seen in quite some time. By 'proper' I don't mean to say that it's amazing per se, but that it actually follows the best story design for the genre. That is to say, it takes its time to give the viewers all the details you could ever ask for as well as plenty of red herrings, it doesn't blatantly break the rules of detective fiction like certain other recent works, and it is also not episodic in any way. It gives you a fair chance to reflect on thecase at hand and try to figure out the problem on your own, and it doesn't try to include any needless supernatural elements in the process. It's just 11 episodes of content all dedicated to a single in-depth mystery, and as a result it actually feels like a traditional detective story. It's simple, but very effective.\\n\\n\r\nBased on a mystery novel of the same name from 1996, The Perfect Insider follows the cryptic death of a genius computer scientist named Magata Shiki, who has been locked up in an isolated research facility on an island for the last 15 years after having been accused of murdering her own parents as a teenager. Nishinosono Moe, a rich young lady, and the university professor Saikawa Souhei travel together to the island with the hopes of meeting Shiki in person, only to find her dead inside her room upon arriving, with her arms and legs cut off. Based on the guards' testimony as well as the security camera footage, it is clear that no one else ever entered or left Shiki's quarters. So who killed her, how and why? Those are the main questions which the story revolves around. In other words, at heart it's a classic 'locked room' problem. Though that's not all there is to it since as you'll find out, the case only escalates even further from that point onwards...\\n\\n\r\nNow since mysteries are very spoiler-sensitive I don't really want to say anything more than that about the story, but I can at least say that while the overall plotline didn't exactly blow my mind... I still found it very satisfying. The most important part of a good mystery is to give the viewers a fair chance at figuring out the problem before the truth is revealed, and The Perfect Insider does a good job at that. Part of the solution is actually not that difficult to figure out on your own, but the whole thing? Yeah I don't think very many people were able to do that, but it all made sense when I finally heard the explanation, and that's all I can really ever ask for.\\n\\n\r\nShiki herself is unquestionably the most interesting character of the anime as is made evident when the others slowly but surely come to realize who she used to be whilst investigating the case. She's crazy, but unbelievably intelligent. As far as Saikawa-sensei and Moe goes though... I can't help but feel like they're utilized more as plot mechanics than actual persons. Saikawa-sensei quite simply fulfills the role of the detective of the case. To quote one of the 20 rules of detective fiction: \"The detective novel must have a detective in it; and a detective is not a detective unless he detects. His function is to gather clues that will eventually lead to the person who did the dirty work in the first chapter; and if the detective does not reach his conclusions through an analysis of those clues, he has no more solved his problem than the schoolboy who gets his answer out of the back of the arithmetic.\" And that is effectively all he does: logically solving the problem, one step at a time. Beyond that he's honestly a quite bland and uninspiring character, but at least he fulfills the role that the story has given him very well. Moe on the other hand is the intermediary character who  is there to ensure that the viewers are able to follow along and don't get confused, by not being quite as sharp as Saikawa-sensei is, and thus making him have to explain most of his discoveries vocally to her, thus indirectly informing the audience in the process as well. And all the other side characters... well they're mostly just 'there', not a whole lot more to say about them.\\n\\n\r\nThe Perfect Insider is produced by A-1 Pictures of all studios, which is pretty unexpected in and of itself since this is hardly the kind of series they usually adapt. They pretty much always make shounen anime, but this time they're tackling a philosophical seinen mystery instead. But either way, they do a surprisingly good job at it, and the animation is as top notch as ever as well. Something that might be worth mentioning here as well is that the character designs are actually made by Asano Inio, the mangaka of Oyasumi Punpun and Solanin among other things. And although The Perfect Insider perhaps doesn't look *that* crazy relatively speaking, you can still really see who the artist is. It's just too characteristic to be unnoticeable.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, The Perfect Insider might be very dialogue-heavy and slow-paced, but I still found significantly more consistent enjoyment value in this anime than almost anything else from this season, mostly because it actually feels like a real mystery for once. Like a legitimately interesting one which teases your imagination and makes you think for yourself. It's surprising just how rare that is to see in anime, but it means quite a lot to me. So even though the mystery in this case might not have been completely flawless, it's still a hell of a lot better than getting nothing at all. I'll just take what I can get.",

            "content": "So, it seems that this anime was a hit more miss with most, who watched. I personally enjoyed the show thoroughly from beginning to end. What seems to be the \"problem\" that most people point out is that the characters are unrealistic or that they are just idiots trying to act smart but I didn't see it that way at all. Agree or disagree I will give you my 2 cents about this series.\r\nI will start with first with the [b]Characters[/b].\r\nIf you don't like 'different/perfect' characters, you won't enjoy the show.\r\nOur lead protagonist Saikawa is a professor at a college but his personality is anythingbut normal, he is very anti social and spends his time thinking about the way humans think and why they think that way. He is curious why people do many things for no reason. \\n\r\nHis mentality is detached from society's typical way of thinking, the way he questions anything and everything would make most people in society look at him like he was crazy. I personally saw his statements as realistic questions to be asked. \\n\\n\r\n\"Every morning I wake up and think am I the same Saikawa I was yesterday? Or am I just trying to play the role of Saikawa?\".  \\n\\n\r\n\"In here it feels like we've been abandoned by time.\"\\n\r\n\"Isn't 'released from' a better phrase as opposed to 'abandoned by'\"\\n\\n\r\n\"Seeing nature and thinking its beautiful is what is unnatural\"\\n\\n\r\n\"In the end, everybody is tied down to their one body, don't you find that terribly restrictive?\"\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed his character because he would say things no other main character would say. Which was something great to me.  \\n\\n\r\nFemale lead protagonist Moe, a math genius who can answer any math question immediately, she is also an unusual character, she isn't quite as curious as Saikawa when it comes humans but she tags along with him. Her above average intellect helps conversations with this unusual male lead to make some sense. Saikawa can't talk to somebody who refuses to share the same train of though. \\n\\n\r\nLastly the main focus of the series, is a woman who is a super genius named Magata. She is world famous for being super smart at the age of 11 and thus they locked her in a room so that she can work alone, for 15 years. Her character is similar to that of Saikawa in that she  questions the human train of thought and emotions. Her train of thought is similar to Saikawa as well.\\n\\n\r\nIf you can't stand 'different/perfect' characters with drastic world views then do not watch this show. \\n\\n\r\n[b]Story[/b]\\n\\n\r\nThe two leads go to the island where the famous Dr. Magata works, and the fact that Moe's family is well known, they are let in upon arriving. When they  enter a murder is committed where the limbs of the body are missing. Although Saikawa prefers to leave Moe convinces him to stay and help figure out this murder mystery. \\n\r\nNot much to say about it in general except, I felt that the revelation of the murder and how they get there is enjoyable. The reasoning behind the murder might be acceptable for you depending on what kind of person are you. Like I said before the characters mainly determine how your enjoyment of this series will go.\\n\\n\r\n[b]Sound[/b] \\n\\n\r\nGreat fantastic awesome whatever. The music was great in this series OP and ED. One of the best of this season. If a great ost is enough to get you to watch a series then this is your show.\\n\\n\r\n[b]Art[/b]\\n\r\nThe art wasn't bad. The only thing that bothered me is the way they drew everybody's eyebrowss, and occasionally how some of the characters eyes looked. Other than that the art was good.\\n\\n\r\n[b]Enjoyment[/b]\\n\r\nEnjoyment was great, probably my favorite show of the season. If you think that OPM is the anime of the season, then I recommend you to avoid this show like the plague. \\n\\n\r\n[b]In Conclusion[/b]\\n\r\nSubete ga F ni Naru is a show that requires your undivided attention, missing the smallest of details can change how you view it. I don\u2019t blame you for not liking it. It is a metaphysical journey that\u2019s more about exploring its concepts than anything. It isn\u2019t meant to be taken at face value and demands you to pay attention to understand it. It\u2019s a show that touches upon the human condition and finding one\u2019s purpose in life. I suggest watching lesser complicated shows before trying to tackleSubete again. Subete is an anime made for people who understand philosophy and also have a keen understanding on how to properly analyze content.",

            "content": "So here we are. The final noitamina show of 2015. Can\u2019t say I\u2019ve been a big fan of the time slot\u2019s constant deaths and revivals to the point that Jean Grey is thinking there\u2019s something wrong with it, and considering that nobody likes The Perfect Insider but people who seem to think that good dialogue automatically equals quality, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to be breaking many hearts when I say that I\u2019m not exactly enthusiastic about having to review the show. But hey, regardless of quality, I think most of us can agree it\u2019s still worth talking about. Not to mention, I get toslap those \u201cnovel adaptations are always good\u201d heathens around, so win/win.\\n\\n\r\nBased on the third or fourth novel in the S&M (Sohei and Moe) series - which I haven\u2019t read, but The Perfect Insider seems to assume its audience has because it doesn\u2019t even bother to tell us who our two leads are - the anime stars our two title characters as they head to an island retreat for a university vacation where thanks to the almighty god that is the mystery writer, a murder happens Detective Conan-style and the two must figure out what\u2019s going on. The series also has a live-action drama that was criticized for being slow-paced, but upon further research, I discovered it actually adapts five novels worth of material within its ten-episode run, which makes me wonder just what the fuck is in these novels that makes them such a tedious chore even when you only have an hour or so to tell the story. Yes it should come to no surprise considering it\u2019s A-1, but for an 11-episode series The Perfect Insider is ridiculously long. And it doesn\u2019t even have any uninspired world-building to fall back on as an excuse. It\u2019s just long for no good reason whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing about mysteries is that once you know the truth behind \u2018em, they cease to be \u201cmysteries\u201d and instead become uninteresting. As such, the bad ones generally rely on the brain-teasing to entice the audience whilst the good ones tie the mystery into other things in order to stay relevant in the long run. Maybe explore the personalities of our main characters. Rope the mystery into some larger plot. Have the villain be a well-respected figure who was turned into a bad guy for no good reason. Basically do everything Paranoia Agent did. You\u2019ll be pleased to hear that not only does Perfect Insider not do any of these things, but the mystery itself doesn\u2019t even make sense. It\u2019s like the guy who was adapting the source material realized he ordered too many timeslots, but rather than actually add anything to the adaptation like, say, telling us who the fuck Sohei and Moe are, he just turned on an episode of Monogatari, became engaged in what he was seeing, and yelled \u201cbrilliant!\u201d And then he saw the mystery made no sense in the novel and went \u201coh who the fuck cares?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s so much boring redundant dialogue in this show that it takes three episodes for the mystery to even fucking start. And even with the long stretches of time spent on talking me to sleep, the show is incredibly lacking in detail. The characters react to deaths the same way a normal person would react to a mosquito bite, and everyone gets free rein of the place like they don\u2019t care that there\u2019s a murderer among them to the point that it felt like they were reading the script. Not to mention that what little we see of the victim\u2019s history does a pretty good job at making me glad that she\u2019s dead because she\u2019s fucking psychotic. Maybe it\u2019s just me, but I find it hard to sympathize with someone who\u2019d kill their family out of nowhere whilst looking like she inhaled two bags of coke. And explain to me where all that AI stuff came from and what it added to the story besides a load of bananas.\\n\\n\r\nWith that said, the show\u2019s total commitment to treating fucked-up relationships and psychic programs as a normal thing was entertaining at points, mainly because it kept making me laugh. Well, not \u201claugh\u201d persay. More like snicker at the idea that someone can say that children grow to kill their parents at the age of fifteen like it\u2019s a normal thing to happen. I guess now we know what happened to all the parents in every single highschool anime ever, amirite? Unfortunately, the amount of unintentionally hilarious dialogue is in a vast minority compared to the ones that are either spouting exposition or talking about Moe\u2019s desires to bone her teacher silly. Which is also kind of unintentionally hilarious in a way. I guess spouting out quantum physics when someone asks you where the rewind button on the Xbone controller is located is considered sexy to some people.\\n\\n\r\nMy point is this: shows that try to get by on dialogue alone are shit. Because animation is a visual medium and not using the visuals to tell the story is like not having gameplay in your video game. That\u2019s right, The Perfect Insider is the anime version of those walking simulator games. The ones where you play as some nameless being trying to find the plot without any challenge in-between the exposition dumps to the point that it feels like you\u2019re reading a book that was chopped into pieces and scattered across the world so that it takes an awfully long time and money to figure out how the story ends. Forgive me for being old-fashioned, but when I buy a book, I prefer to have the entire thing at my disposal and not have to buy a new chapter every time I go to a new book store. If I had to do that, Huckleberry Finn would have taken three years to finish reading.\\n\\n\r\nPlus, why should I care about the dialogue when it\u2019s being spoken by a bunch of dull drama stereotypes with no personal story or stakes in the mystery whatsoever? Did anyone ever watch LA Confidential and thought it would have been improved if you replaced Guy Pearce with some random kid genius who has no connection with the police force and just said what the audience was thinking whilst discovering the dead body underneath the house? Of course not. Because that kid would have been really fucking boring! I don\u2019t watch anime to see people react to things. I watch anime to see people doing things. And I can\u2019t remember one thing Sohei and Moe ever did besides wonder what was going on and then eventually figure out the truth in one long info-dump before going about their lives.\\n\\n\r\nI mean did this experience change them? Did they go through any character growth throughout the series? Did they have any personal connection with the victim? I remember Moe talking with her once and that was it. Why exactly are Sohei and Moe the main characters if they\u2019re not going to affect the story? Even Benedict Cumberbatch had to match personal wits with the otherwise-unconnected criminals he faces at the end of each episode of Sherlock.\\n\\n\r\nFair warning to all my readers. I\u2019m going to spoil the plot of this show now, because I can\u2019t get deep into its silliness otherwise. After more than eight episodes of exposition-dumping along with one really bad Engrish scene that grated my ears harder than the voice-acting in a post-90s Sonic game, the show decides to reveal through several overly long and tensionless exposition scenes that absolutely none of the characters we met along the way was the culprit and that the person they thought was the victim was actually a look-alike who killed herself because fifteen years of planning couldn\u2019t stand up to the words that came out of Moe\u2019s mouth. The original plan was to have both the intended victim and her husband killed because they lived fucked up lives and apparently this is their way of seeking redemption rather than - oh, I don\u2019t know - turning themselves in. Instead, the intended murderer killed herself, the intended victim escapes the island, she shows up one last time to tell Sohei that she won\u2019t get caught, we get a final episode consisting of nothing but tying up loose ends rather than giving me some actual payoff, and then the show ends with a scene consisting of the intended victim and the actual victim talking about the meaning of life.\\n\\n\r\nSo in other words, assuming that load of boring plot dump doesn\u2019t put you to sleep, the only character who gets any sort of resolution out of this ridiculously long mystery is the unlikeable and uninteresting murderer we barely got to know, and it\u2019s an incredibly anticlimactic one as well. Somewhere in Hell, Albert Wesker from Resident Evil is watching this show (and I have it on good authority that Satan allows his followers to watch anime in Hell) and going \u201cdude, I was treated with more dignity than this. And I was killed by a muscleman and his incredibly stupid black sidekick who\u2019d waste valuable health sprays on you if you so much as got a paper cut.\u201d",

            "content": "\"The natural state of things is death, so life itself is a sort of illness. When the illness is cured, life vanishes.\" Shiki Magata\r\n(This is just a brief touch of the pretense contained in this show) \r\n- The Perfect Insider - \r\nStory: 5\r\nThe biggest issue with Perfect Insider's story isn't the mystery itself, no- the biggest issue plaguing this show is the Anime Logic\u2122. Apparently Hiroshi Mori didn't even bother to do a cursory search for any kind of legal books, case law, or anything regarding the legality of murder and subsequent judicial proceedings of someone accused and convicted of such. \r\nIn his stead, Idid my own research, which turned up some very strange findings. Case law for Japan is very difficult to find, and even more rare in English; however, the cases that are involved are typically public information, excepting those involving minors- similarly to the US. \\n\\n\r\nIn Japan, they do not follow the M'naghten rule- that is, in an insanity plea, where the distinction must be made of a person who is accused of a crime as to whether they were insane at the time of the CRIME, or insane at the time of the TRIAL. The goal is to determine whether temporary insanity or claims of insanity to try and get off are valid. If someone is determined insane at the time of the trial, the trial is then postponed and they are involuntarily committed to a mental institution until such a time that they are deemed competent to stand trial, if ever. Time spent in said asylum counts as time served in the event that they are convicted after being found competent. \\n\\n\r\nIn 2001, a man in Osaka went into an elementary school and stabbed 8 children to death, and injured another 13 children and two teachers. He was diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder, BPD, and PPD. He was sentenced to death by hanging, and it was carried out in 2004. \\n\\n\r\nIn 2007, a 16 year old girl murdered her father with an axe in Kyoto. Because the case involved a minor, few details are available, but it's almost certain that she walked free. \"I didn't like my father so I killed him,\" Kyodo news agency quoted the girl as saying. \\n\r\n-Japan allows this kind of thing.\\n\\n\r\nIn 2008, a man drove a truck into a crowd in Akihabara and killed three people, got out, stabbed and killed four more, injuring an additional 10 people before being apprehended. He was then RELEASED FROM POLICE CUSTODY after two days, and rearrested 10 DAYS LATER. He was sentenced to death in 2011, upheld in 2015. \\n\\n\r\nWhat Japan does (because of deep seated cultural norms and customs, along with having no actual laws pertaining to the matter of mentally ill committing violent crime), as evidenced in the aforementioned cases, is seemingly either A) put them to death, or B) let them walk free. \\n\\n\r\nApparently Hiroshi Mori was aware of B) and kept that in mind when writing Perfect Insider, with a healthy dose of Anime Logic\u2122 to keep it firmly on the side of \"That's some crap\". Dr. Shiki Magata manages to not only get away with the double murder of her parents (be declared not competent to stand trial and 'released to the care of her family' {as per Japanese law}), but then be allowed to walk free and live inside of a laboratory for 15 years. Never mind that this lab is not monitored by the police and government, a total lack of oversight over a dangerous, mentally ill AND unstable criminal, but that she's also able to open the door HERSELF and leave, were it to come to that. \\n\\n\r\nAbout 200 years ago, a guy named Ed Allan wrote a story about how to imprison someone you don't want leaving... it involved some bricks and a little bit of wine. Bottom line is, if they didn't want Shiki to escape, why the hell would they build a door to her \"cell\" that SHE can open? That's just plain stupid. You don't give prisoners a key to their cell when they go to jail. \\n\\n\r\nThe next bit of ridiculous anime logic is how, once Dr. Magata escapes, she's instantaneously wanted by the police. Oh, now that she's not in her little laboratory that she ran herself, she's now wanted? What are they going to do when they arrest her this time? Slap on the wrist, walk free again? What purpose does this serve? \\n\r\nThere was a tiny scene showing her arraignment in court, and the apparent release implied thereafter. I don't know what's more insane, Japan's laws on mentally ill persons committing violent crimes like murder, or Dr. Magata. \\n\\n\r\nThe detective characters also overlook so many obvious clues that I nearly smashed my frontal bone completely in two with my palm. They also take everything that the workers at the lab say at face value, including ridiculous absolutes like \"it's IMPOSSIBLE for anything to be wrong with the computer system\", or \"this door can NEVER be opened\", or \"NO ONE EVER has come or gone from here\", and others. There wouldn't be a mystery if these absolutes were true, so why they continue to stick to them and the protagonists believe them is beyond me. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 4\\n\\n\r\nOnto our characters, Saikawa is one of the edgiest level 98 Glorious Edgemaster  of Balrons ever. He's edgier than stepping on a Lego, barefoot (which also feature prominently in this show- product placement, hah!). This guy is the ultimate form of cool. He's got the look- long shaggy mop hair that hangs over one eye like a 15 year old scene kid, the only thing that he's missing is the dyed edge of his hair and eye makeup, which he makes up for by having two black eyes because he's too edgy to sleep, because sleeping might take away time from his infinitely deep philosophical musings. He wears shirts with sarcastic phrases or esoteric images on them that only further deepen this mystique he's trying to build. Which really just means that he doesn't care about his appearance because such things are beneath him. Saikawa also smokes incessantly, because smoking just further increases your cool points.\\n\\n\r\nSaikawa exists in the show mostly to spout off pseudo intellectual BS that can be found any day of the week on the hot list of r/iam14andthisisdeep. In fact, this page was probably inspired by the original 1996 Perfect Insider novel. His musings include, but are not limited to: the meaning of life, the meaning of death, the meaning of love, and many other answerless questions. His powers include: a deep and unexplained understanding of programming languages, BS skills like no other, and being a tough guy who resists cute girls for no other reason than that he's just too far advanced in knowledge and understanding to be trifled with such foolish things. \\n\\n\\n\r\nNishinosono: \\n\\n\r\nShe exists in the show to attempt to give a more human feel to the robotic Saikawa, and to have someone in the show that's stupid and doesn't get it, and so in having it explained to them, the audience also gets the developments going on in Saikawa's head. Other than that, Nishinosono's presence is to blush anytime someone mentions Saikawa's name, and generally fawn over him and how edgy he is. \\n\\n\r\nThese characters in Perfect Insider are the dumbest smart people I've ever seen. Mr. Mori seemingly was never told \"show, not tell\"- which is rule #1 in characterization. I don't care how many times you beat me over the head with Nishinosono telling Saikawa how smart he is, or how observant or technologically proficient he is, or the same apparent attributes of Dr. Magata. I don't have any idea why Saikawa or Nishinosono are supposedly such brilliant people, as I've no indication of their backgrounds or lives outside of what little we're shown in flashbacks. I know that Saikawa is an educated man because he's a professor of architecture, but that does not explain his seemingly boundless knowledge of the various technologies and workings of a so called \"genius\"- Dr. Magata. \\n\\n\r\nFor the icing on the stupid cake, the mystery is finally solved with a really bad deus ex machina, whereas the rest of the tale was unraveled using semi-to-realistic logic and things that can actually happen. Suffice to say that some characters get into some Tranquility Lane style virtual reality loungers and manage to find what they were looking for. A real cop out of a way to \"solve\" the mystery. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall: 4, 5\\n\\n\r\nIt makes me sad to learn that Kenji Kawai did the soundtrack for this pile, because it was utterly forgettable. Honestly, this isn't the worst series of the season, but as far as being a mystery, it's far too reliant on conveniences and longshots in an shallow attempt at appearing deep. I had figured out about 80% of the mystery by the 5th or 6th episode, and it was all downhill from there, with a really forgettable cast of characters and a hokey ending.",

            "content": "The Perfect Insider is a great example of how fast an interesting premise can turn into a bad story. If you came to this anime looking for an interesting and intellectual show, then I would advise you to look somewhere else. \r\nSTORY\r\nThis show started out with an interesting premise. The premise being that a genius programmer Shiki Magata is murdered within a locked room on an isolated island. This becomes a game of cat and mouse, as our two main characters (or protagonists) search around for clues to the mystery. While I hyped the premise initially, the actual progression/execution of the show was lackluster tosay the least. The answer to the mystery was rather predictable, but I was hoping that the execution would be better. The themes were simply not explored enough and most of dialogue seem unneeded or unnatural. In fact most of the show consists of poorly written dialogue, with very slow pacing and annoying plot holes/plot conveniences. This show tries to bombard you with pseudo-intellectualism, rather than actual facts, logic or interesting logistical questions. \\n\\n\r\nEven when a noteworthy question is asked, it is quickly overshadowed by other non-sense within the show. In some cases, the question is not even related to the problem at hand. In other situations, the answers are very left field or do not even answer the question. However, the final episode was very well written. Unlike previous episodes many interesting questions were proposed and answered. We gain a bit more understanding of Shiki Magata; however, one episode does not make up for the entirety of the show. The plot just contains a lot of lazy writing, pseudo-intellectualism and moments of huge info dumping.  \\n\\n\r\n\"Every human starts as a genius. And as they age, they become average.\"- Shiki Magata\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nAll of the characters are surprisingly flat, which is shocking coming from a dialogue heavy show. Many of their motivations, fears, or dreams are stripped away. We are left with dull 2-dimensional characters, with no additional interesting information or talents about them. There are three main characters: \\n\r\nSouhei Saikawa:\\n\r\nAngsty, pseudo-intellectual main character, who solves the mystery with almost little to no insight. Most of his rants have nothing to do with the actual plot, and his moments of \u201cgenius\u201d are ass-pulls.\\n\\n\r\nShiki Magata: \\n\r\nGenius, yet psychotic programmer, with the foresight of a time wizard. There\u2019s almost no motivation for this character and no personality either. She\u2019s merely a plot device, nothing more or less.\\n\\n\r\nMoe Nishinosono:\\n\r\nYoung side kick who obsesses over Souhei. She\u2019s just a hollow placeholder for the audience to project their views and feelings through, while they watch the show. \\n\\n\r\nART/ANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nThe art is typical, nothing new in this department; however, the animation can be a bit sloppy at some points. For anime built around dialogue, many of the scenes were often animated badly. There were many jump cuts and some seriously awkward camera angles.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND/OST\\n\\n\r\nThis is where Subete redeems itself. The OST was rather fitting for the type of narrative created. It added to the atmosphere and overall progression of the show. The opening and ending songs were very well done. The opening was very catchy. The ending song keeps and maintains this upbeat feeling, unlike most ending songs of today. The voice acting was spot on, I have no complaint in this section. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\\n\r\nThe Perfect Insider is a mediocre at best. No matter how interesting a premise is, if the execution and characters cannot match, then the show simply fails. Subete unfortunately bit off more than it could chew, which caused it to resort to pseudo-intellectualism blurs rather than creating logic/interesting dialogue and characters. I would say to try another show before you watch Subete ga F ni Naru: The Perfect Insider.\\n\\n\r\nFINAL GRADE\\n\r\nD\\n",

            "content": "Synopsis on Crunchyroll: Based on the award-winning novel Subete ga F ni Naru by Hiroshi Mori, The Perfect Insider finds Sohei Saikawa, a member of the Saikawa Research Lab, and Moe Nishinosono, the daughter of his mentor, on vacation when they discover a corpse. The two then work together to solve the mysteries of what becomes a serial murder case. \r\nI don't normally write reviews, but I had to make an exception for this show since I'm not too sure that many people are quite getting its meaning. For people who are currently on the fence trying to decide whether or not to watch PerfectInsider, please do not take the current aggregate score on MyAnimeList as an indicative measurement of the overall quality. The anime is simply different, not bad; and, to be quite frank, it takes an open mind and different kind of thinking towards plot progression to appreciate what is being done here. \\n\\n\r\nThe first and foremost aspect of the plot that must be addressed is that it does NOT primarily belong to the mystery genre. I can not stress this enough. If you start watching this anime thinking that it will have a conventional mystery plotline, such as Sherlock Holmes, then you will be severely disappointed by the outcome. For instance, the \"mystery\" aspect of the anime doesn't actually begin until the very end of episode 2 going into episode 3. Furthermore, the progression (i.e. the deductive and inductive analysis) is very slow and does not build up to \"edge-of-your-seat\" climatic moments. Quite simply, you won't find a clever detective snooping around with a magnifying glass and quirky methodologies to solve the mystery. What you get, instead, is Sohei Saikawa and a lot of philosophical dialogue; and this is the main point that I wanted to get to.\\n\\n\r\nPerfect Insider is more of a kind of documentary than anything else. It \"documents\" the character's and their personalities to make a commentary on the human condition. The mystery aspect is, quite honestly, a side-note that adds a little bit of spunk to the overall narrative. However, it is still completely necessary as the mystery genre, in general, offers some of the best opportunities for internal reflection and inquiry. The exception in Perfect Insider is that, instead of asking solely HOW the killer committed the crime, a good portion of time is spend also asking WHY the killer committed the crime; and this all ties in with the philosophical dialogues that are persistent throughout the anime. \\n\\n\r\nSo, what type of viewer would enjoy this show? An intellectual. And by intellectual, I do not mean someone who is \"smart\" or \"intelligent.\" I mean someone who likes to inquire about nature and ponder the meaning that their life holds. There is a particular quote by Saikawa in episode 1 that stuck out to me, and it is something like this: Whenever I get up in the morning, I always think to myself, \"Am I really the same person I was yesterday\"? If you're someone that truly thinks about questions like these, then the meaning of Perfect Insider may make a lot more sense to you than the average person. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I can not say that Perfect Insider is perfect in itself. It could focus a bit more on the plot progression and character development, of which there exists none, in my opinion. I do not wish to get into a generic review discussing the music and animation, as both are of average to good quality, so there isn't really anything left to discuss. In addition, the score that I provide for this anime is not indicative of my overall impression; it is just something that is, of course, required.  One last thing that I do want to mention is that this anime is based off of a novel of a similar name, and, as a result, it holds a particular degree of \"unity.\"\\n\r\n In other words, the ending ties in and complements the beginning, and vice versa. So, remember this if you become confused by some of the scenes. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I think that Perfect Insider is a great anime with a good story and interesting character personalities. Please do not simply let the opinions of others, including myself, carry the significant weight in your overall decision-making. After all, we are all free to make our own choices as long as we first define \"ourselves.\"\\n",

            "content": "The Perfect Insider is a mystery anime that came out in October 2015 and is an adaptation of a light novel by the same name, which was released in 1996. That should be enough to set expectations really low, and that is really the only way to enjoy this show. Either that or you only care about visuals, superficial characters and ignore plot holes.\r\n     So I'll start by saying what's good about this show. It was animated by A-1 Pictures, the same studio that adapted Sword Art Online, Shigatsu Wa Kimi No Uso and Fairy Tail(2009-2013), among others, into an anime. If you have watched any of the previously mentioned shows, you will know that A-1 Pictures makes some of the best lookin visuals and animation out there. The Perfect Insider is not an exception. The color palette used is bright and colorful, the backgrounds are beautiful, character figures move in a very fluid way, face expressions are detailed and there are no significant quality drops. Audio wise, the sound effects are pretty good, and the soundtrack, although forgettable, fits the show's ambience.\\n\\n\r\n     And so looking pretty is all that this show does well, and since every anime nowdays looks pretty, this isn't much to write home about. It does nothing to distinguish itself from every other mystery story out there.\\n\\n\r\n     And speaking of mystery, the whole purpose of having one in a story is to serve as a hook to keep people interested. It is a very good way to gradually reveal things about the world, plot or characters if they are not meant to be explained all at once. But it should never overshadow said world, plot or characters, and the Perfect Insider does exactly that. Everyone except the main characters are simply there to make the plot move forward. They get no characterization, no development, and feel very one dimensional. Some are not even given a name!\\n\\n\r\n     The main characters are not much better too. One of the protagonists is the typical \"genius that hates the world he lives in\" edgelord stereotype, randomly spewing out filosophical thoughts that sometimes don't even have anything to do with the story at all, in a poor attempt at making the show look \"deep\" and \"a commentary on the human condition\". The only thing that defines him is his love for cigarettes. The other protagonist is a girl that is in love with edgelord 420 (for no apparent reason), and is just as boring and bland as him.\\n\\n\r\n     The main villain is easily the most interesting character in the whole show, because unlike others she has motives and objectives, and is given a backstory and reasons to act like she does. Still, she is above average at best, since she also suffers from many of the same problems the other two main characters do.\\n\\n\r\n     Back to the mystery aspect, for a mystery to be done well, it needs to foreshadow future evens by giving hints and clues. The idea is that the viewer should have enough information to predict said future events. For example, in Death Note, the author makes sure to let us know everything we need to know to make the mind games feel plausible. Things like Light getting out of a difficult situation because he knew one crucial detail that was never hinted at before about the rules of the death note doesn't happen. The Perfect Insider does the exact opposite. To exemplify, there is a scene where the protagonist looks at a bookshelf (never shown before, by the way) and notices an important detail, a pattern in the books' volume numbers. There was no way anyone could have seen that coming, since this was never hinted at, thus making it a half-assed, poorly written way to make the story continue to unfold.\\n\\n\r\n     The mystery finally comes to an end when the main character has an epiphany and suddenly figures everything out, out of nowhere. Again, impossible for anyone to have thought of what he did.\\n\\n\r\n     To sum up, forgettable cardboard characters, plot that barely makes sense, slow pacing, pretentious and sometimes unnecessary filosophical reflections, poorly executed mystery, but beautiful visuals, very good animation and decent sound. The Perfect Insider is boring, forgettable, and badly written.",

            "content": "(No spoilers)\r\nThis anime is not for everyone, firstly you have to enjoy a more classic slow-paced mystery detective plot but mostly you have to enjoy \"clever\" conversations which might throw a lot of people off especially because it sometimes seems that the anime is trying to be too intelligent.\r\nFor me I watched the series to the end because of the relationship and interactions between the two main characters, I must say that the mystery part was until the last episodes a bit boring or just average but it was very enjoyable because of those two main characters.\r\nAll the rainbow faeces of the Unicorn - thegood things\\n\r\n- The art style for the 3 main characters was different and serious/realistic for the tone of the anime.\\n\r\n- The opening was quite entertaining and artistic :)\\n\r\n- The plot was average but the interaction between the 2-3 main characters made this anime great. I see this series as more of an romantic anime than mystery/thriller anime :3\\n\r\n- For me I liked the pace of the story, yes it is slow but only for developing the main characters, so I think that it was quite fitting.\\n\\n\r\nAll the hurtful.... cringe! - The cons \\n\r\n- The mystery was itself good but it could have been better and the anime could have paced a little bit quicker with the mystery plot.\\n\r\n- For me the soundtrack was just average, nothing to complain nor embrace.\\n\r\n- The conversations between the characters are very \"smart\"/philosophical which is understandable not for everyone\u00b4s taste and you really need to pay attention for all the small hints hidden in the conversations. \\n\\n\r\nSo yeah if you want to see a really good mystery detective series then this anime might not be for you, you really have to love the relationship and interaction between the two main characters because they are the factor which makes up the series. The mystery plot seems more like a catalyst for their relationship, the mystery plot isn\u00b4t the main focus I think ^^",

            "content": "*Some context:* I have been seriously watching anime for over 4 years now, and I have never found the need to actually write a review. This would be my first one, so I hope you guys bare with it. \r\nI'll explain my plight with a humorous short story - trust me, it's much more interesting that this anime:\r\n==\r\nIn an art competition, an artist stands in front of his painting, and the judges walk up to him and ask him to explain the concept before opening and revealing the painting on canvas. The artist says that he has drawn the situation where: \"Buddha lets fly awhite dove to symbolize peace and walks away. Unfortunately, a hunter who was hidden shoots this dove. The dove falls to the ground and dies.\" \\n\r\nThe judges were mesmerized with the concept and were yearning to see the painting. The artist reveals the canvas and it's absolutely white and plain. They ask him:\\n\r\nWhere is Buddha? - I told you that he let the dove fly and left!\\n\r\nWhere is the hunter? - I told you that he was hidden!\\n\r\nWhere is the dove? - I told you that it fell to the ground and died!\\n\r\nI think this anime is much like that. There is quite frankly a stupid hype around an absolutely plain and bland anime. If you are capable of just looking at a white canvas and imagining a concept as deep as above, maybe you'll enjoy this one. For mere mortals like myself, this anime is mediocre at best, and absolute shit if you are in a bad mood.\\n\r\n==\\n\\n\r\n=== My thoughts (mild spoilers) ====\\n\\n\r\n-- I think the Perfect Insider is at best a mediocre series, and your disappointment with it will likely increase the more you think about it. \\n\\n\r\n-- I feel that the author got hold of one idea: a person is locked in a room for 15 years with minimal observation inside the cell; this person must have a child inside which no one knows about; and a glorious plan is set into motion which lasts the entire 15 years.\\n\\n\r\n-- In order to make this implausible and frankly ridiculous idea a reality, the creators perform one ass-pull after the other. In order to disguise these ass-pulls, they pepper it up with copious amount of philosophical rants, which after a point becomes absolutely silly.\\n\\n\r\n-- There are some scenes, dialogues, and actions which wanted to portray a high-brow attitude and show that some of these characters are really smart. These absolutely bombed. I am working towards a PhD in Math/CS at a top university, and I haven't come across a single professor or student who acts this way. Some of the CS ideas are plain wrong too.\\n\\n\r\n-- Character motivations are not explained at all. Things happen a particular way because the author wanted it to happen that way. The events don't seem to evolve organically and feel almost forced. There are no reasons given for *why* a character does something other than the fact that doing so furthers a plot. There appear to be numerous alternative actions some characters could have done (including Dr. Shiki) which would have been quicker, neater, and led to the same final conclusion. People claimed to be as smart as these characters would certainly see such alternatives.\\n",

            "content": "TL;DR: Everything Becomes F: The Perfect Insider has what you might call the Prometheus problem. It looks good, seems interesting & at first you're totally along for the ride. Then, at some point, you start noticing that nothing makes sense & the more information it gives you, more questions you have.\r\nFall 2015 started out looking like such a strong season for detective dramas. Alongside the Return of Kindaichi Case Files, there were two new titles that looked set to fill a void for non-fantasy murder mysteries, with Beautiful Bones: Sakurako's Investigation & Everything Becomes F: The Perfect Insider (EBF) adding some new blood into agenre that has relatively slim pickings for anim\u00e9 fans. \\n\\n\r\n1. Story\\n\\n\r\nAt first, EBF seemed likely to be the best of all three. While Kindaichi began with what was the weakest case file of the series thus far, & Beautiful Bones seemed more interested in being Pet Pathologist of Sakurako than solving crimes, EBF's first few episodes provided a slow build up to its murder mystery, with a noticeably different art style, much darker tone & a more complex & intriguing story with a greater focus on the thoughts & philosophies of the main characters than in the other shows. While certainly slow, these early episodes laid a pretty solid looking foundation for a darker, smarter story than one can usually expect from TV anim\u00e9\\n\\n\r\nEBF's story unfolds through three plot lines that take place at different times & from the perspective of different characters. In the main story, Moe Nishinosono & her teacher/guardian/crush Souhei Saikawa all but blag their way into an island facility that houses Shiki Magata, the infamous as she is mysterious woman who murdered her parents fifteen years ago & has since lived in total isolation underground. No sooner do they manage this, then they find themselves caught up in a gruesome & seemingly impossible double murder. Concurrent to this, there are flashbacks to a previous interview between Moe & Shiki, in which Shiki takes a strange interest in Moe's past; & each episode also ends with another flashback, apparently from the perspective of Shiki's uncle writing his memories of a very dark & twisted relationship between Shiki & himself. \\n\\n\r\nFor the first few episodes of EBF, its slow pacing teeters on but doesn't completely cross the line between methodical & boring. EBF is a very dialogue driven series, & a large portion of the runtime is taken up by two characters talking about the mystery, which is even more impenetrable to them than the audience because they lack the benefit of those flashbacks giving context to Shiki's past & thus why she might have ended up how she did. While quite dry & dense, not to mention some laughably clunky lines like \"red...red is a colour\" the plot slowly builds momentum towards solving the cryptic riddle, apparently left by the killer, of what everything becomes F means, & thus the who, how & why of this seemingly impossible closed room murder mystery (incidentally, what's with anim\u00e9 & having characters use that literary term to refer to cases? Is it meant to be meta?)\\n\\n\r\nHowever, for all the potential of EBF, it ultimately falls apart once the characters & setting have been established. The deliberately slow pacing of the show increasingly seems less about methodically building up to a resolution than it is padding out an overly long runtime. The conversations between Moe & Souhei, which can be hard enough to sit through to begin with, start repeating themselves as they pretty much have nothing to do between episode six, when they first solve the meaning of F, & episode 10 when the plot finally decides it's time to close the case. Indeed, in what I can only assume was a rather glaring error that slipped through the script drafting process, they forget that they've solved the meaning of F (one meaning, anyway) so they can have another overly long exchange on what it might mean. This dialogue problem reaches it's most excruciating during an exchange between Souhei & a woman who's supposedly Shiki's sister which lasts ten minutes, is entirely in English & the VA's are clearly exerting all their effort into just getting the words right.\\n\\n\r\n2. Characters\\n\\n\r\nIt doesn't help that EBF's characters are, frankly, not able to carry such a slow story. Moe, can seem at times like she stumbled out of a high school anim\u00e9. Her character is meant to act as the emotional counterbalance to Souhei's cold rationalism, even though she is a maths genius which would suggest a character more suited to cool logic. Unfortunately, she mostly expresses this side of her by being petulant & sulky, especially when Souhei doesn't notice her. She seems to get jealous whenever other women talk to or even about him, & quickly seems to start measuring herself against Shiki when she sees the interest Souhei has in trying to figure out her strange ways. The plot has an habit of taking a break from solving the mystery to focus on Moe & Souhei's relationship, which is annoying at best - not least because the author has all but said he added a slow burning relationship between the two just to keep people reading his books (of which EBF is the first of nine volumes & various short stories).\\n\\n\r\nSouhei himself is the aloof, introverted type who speaks in monologues even when talking to other people.  VA Yasuyuki Kase also gives to Souhei a low, monotone voice that is suitable to the character, but means that a large portion of every episode is listening to his monotonous monologues. That Souhei is a self-important, get on my level type of character just makes it worse to listen to. \\n\\n\r\nHis interest in the mystery seems purely intellectual. Indeed, it's arguably a flaw of the show that there is actually no reason for Souhei & Moe to be there or be allowed to investigate. They first go to the facility because Moe claims to have an interview with Shiki, but that's soon revealed to be a lie, merely a devise to get them on the island (not the last time the story will rely on such a convenient contrivance to keep moving). Once the corpses appear, it's like they're solving the case just out of intellectual curiosity, which is fine & all but it doesn't explain why the staff are so cooperative, nor does it make for a compelling murder mystery in which he seems increasingly less interested in solving the mystery than in waxing lyrically about the philosophy that's apparently behind Shiki's & his own character.\\n\\n\r\nShiki is a difficult character to talk about in a spoiler free manner, given that everything in EBF revolves around her. She has a detached, otherworldly manner to her that is not entirely unlike the aloofness of Souhei, but whereas he generally comes across as a bit self-loathing because he too normal for his liking, Shiki does operate in a completely different way to \u201cregular\u201d people. From the way she interacts with people in the flashbacks to the clues found by Moe & Souhei during their investigation, she comes across not unlike Hannibal Lecter, someone as fascinating as they are impenetrable.\\n\\n\r\nThat impenetrableness, however, is also one of her flaws. Shiki is a character you want to understand, to decipher, but it's not possible to do so because, while I won't go into specifics, the reason for her being the enigma she is is ultimately that she was just born that way. That might not be an issue for some viewers, but for me personally saying a character was just born that way is like ending a story with it was all just a dream; even if the author intended it to be that way, it still feels like a cop out. This might be more of a problem in EBF's case because whereas Lecter's character is there to serve as a window into the mind of a different serial killer, Shiki is front & centre the focus of the story. \\n\\n\r\nQuite what her world view is also comes across in a rather jumbled manner. Themes of antinatalism, the nature of self & existentialism, nihilism & any other school of philosophy you fancy bringing up can be found somewhere, & it's clear some viewers have got a lot out of identifying & reading up on these. But be that as it may, Shiki herself is a character that makes less sense the more you're told about her, as do her motivations & actions. Souhei towards the end seems to view her as some sort of perfect human, but why that is seems to boil down to that she seems as complex as he wishes he was.\\n\\n\r\nIf this seems like too much focus to be putting on the main characters, it's simply because there is almost nothing worth saying about any of the support. The university students that accompany Souhei & Moe are really only there so Moe can talk to someone other than Souhei about the case in one episode. Likewise the staff at the facility just seem to wait around to be interviewed or push the plot button on a relevant keyboard. Shiki's uncle, who is nominally one of the characters whose point of view we're supposed to be viewing part of the story from, is completely eclipsed by his nieces presence & doesn't really have anything to him worth mentioning. Indeed, if EBF had just been Moe, Souhei & Shiki in a room together, it wouldn't have changed much.\\n\\n\r\n3. Production\\n\\n\r\nOn the production side of things, there are some rather odd directorial decisions that have been made during EBF. A couple of scenes, most notably the final one, seem to cut off abruptly & awkwardly. One scene where Souhei is talking to an employee of the facility has what looks like a rather amusing continuity error, where Souhei is meant to be cooking breakfast but whenever it cuts from showing the food to him talking, he's standing in the office with his hand apparently holding an invisible pan. Perhaps finally realising that watching two people sitting down, talking in shot, reverse-shot is rather boring, towards the end there are a couple of dialogue scenes where the location repeatedly changes during unbroken conversation; which is disorientating as much as it is attention keeping.\\n\\n\r\nThat's not to say EBF looks bad, by any means. Indeed it is a visually enjoyable experience, which is fortunate given how little movement or action occurs. The colour is sufficiently desaturated to suit the tone of the story, & the character designs are likewise realistic enough to not feel out of place as more stylised face designs would have. But, if I'm being honest, this is like complimenting a grey blur for picking the right shade of grey. The OP & ED are both enjoyable, with the OP being a rather fun to interpret dance routine between stencil outlines of Souhei, Moe & Shiki. So that's three minutes of this nearly four hour show worth watching, at least. There is a rather contrived reason to get Moe into a two piece swimsuit in one episode, but other than that the director resists the temptation to add the usual anime visual clich\u00e9s. \\n\\n\r\nThis review has been harsher on EBF than it perhaps was intended to be, but then again it's the type of show that the more I think about it, the less it holds up. That the main characters are rather flawed could have made them interesting, but they're so boring & full of themselves that it it doesn't take long to be sick of seeing them. You only have to look at the Sodachi arc of Owarimonogatari, which aired at the same time, to see how a dialogue driven dark mystery anime can be done better. \\n\\n\r\nThere are some clever sounding twists that initially make you think \"oooh that's interesting\" till you pause to think about how they just complicate & confuse an already difficult to comprehend story. In fact clever sounding twists that complicate everything pretty much sums up EBF, especially with regards to Shiki. It's a real shame that it is this way, because buried in there, somewhere, was a murder mystery I really wanted to like. Indeed, if I were to rewatch the series again, knowing what depths it sinks to, I'd probably have an even more negative opinion of it.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe it's because they're only adapting the first in a series of novels, which means nothing is really concluded & indeed gives the whole series the sense of just being the first act or prologue to a bigger story. Indeed, in a perfect world I'd like to imagine they would have adapted the entire series, making each one a feature length episode in the way ITV did their best detective dramas in the 90s & early 2000's. But whatever EBF could have been, it's hard to recommend what it is.",

I normally don't watch a lot of mystery or thriller anime, but so far I've enjoyed The Perfect Insider more than I honestly thought I would. Obviously, the animation and character designs are nothing impressive, which is why I scored it so low in the art department, and Shikawa is really the only character I've found interesting and solid in his development; however, the opening and ending theme songs are great, and the soundtrack for the overall show has some pretty good, fitting tracks as well.\r\nOthers have said the show moves fairly slow,and in my opinion they're right. This doesn't detract from the show's pacing though; for The Perfect Insider, it works well, and I like how you're provided with information - both in the present and from the past - at varying intervals. Everything slowly falls into place, and it's certainly not chronological but I think it's more enjoyable to learn different things that are all over the place, and piece them together yourself as you follow the show and the character's own thoughts and insights. It's definitely a show you have to stick with; noticeably, those who gave the show lower ratings didn't watch that much of it, but if you're willing to endure slow pacing and average side characters that are somewhat lacking in the personality department, then you're honestly in for a treat plot-wise; Subeta ga F ni Naru: The Perfect Insider is a hidden gem of twists, revelations and a seemingly impossible mystery.",

At the very beginning the mystery seems pretty interesting and each chapter you have different clues so you can make your own theory along with the characters. The main problem for me was that the plot has giant holes that do not explain the whole thing. There are some questions that are pretty obvious and there's no answer for any of them so you're left with the assumption that every single person in that laboratory are idiots for it to make sense. \r\nART: 7/10\r\nThe drawing styleof the characters was pretty plain. The animation is not that bad but it has nothing remarkable about it.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI loved the ending and the opening. The rest of the soundtrack is quite fine.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI'm assuming that since this anime is based on a novel, the book will give more insight about the characters. As with the plot there are many things left unanswered and you kind of want to know more about the characters and understand them better.\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion the only character fully developed is Shiki Magata and if it wasn't for her this series wouldn't be worth the time.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nIt is quite entertaining and interesting, but if you have seen more mysteries there some situations that are gonna make you feel disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nIt is a nice series if you do not know what to watch, but as a mystery is quite poor and disappointing. The only worthwhile thing about it is the character of Shiki Magata.",

The story soon transformed from a murder mystery to a math/computer geek's wet dream come true. Even with all of that, given thatthe pursuit of the truth was done with an emphasis on 'logic' the final revelation was so far out there that you'd need the Hubble telescope to find it.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the show is enjoyable in its build-up, the events immediately prior to the final revelation along with the revelation itself fail to keep the plot tight and focused. In the end, too much time is spent on abstract philosophy and less on the actual crimes committed. If the first few episodes were not thoroughly enjoyable for their MIND F**K moments, I wouldn't have enjoyed this show at all.",

            "content": "The Perfect Insider is hard to review objectively because it is one of those shows that people will defend as being \"deep\" and \"nuanced\". I'm not going to argue against that, maybe there is some deeper truth that I missed, but I didn't enjoy it and my review will reflect that.\r\nFirst of all, the good: This show is visually appealing, especially the opening theme animation. I also found the animation pretty solid throughout and the sound never really distracted me from the story. \r\nThe problems I've had with the show was the story. The show does a good job of setting up the sense thatthere's going to be a grand denouement where the truth is found out and the guilty part is pointed out, or that everything will come to be clear.  \\n\\n\r\nTo a certain extend this is accomplished. You know who did what at the end, but it felt unsatisfactory, probably because there was so much going on that I just started getting lost halfway through the story. There's a romance, child sexual abuse by a relative (though maybe not in the strictest legal sense in Japan, certainly for America/most countries since age of concent is different), a murder, a ghost in a computer, a doll that killed someone else years ago then ran away, multiple personalities, two sets of dead parents unrequited love, sisters showing up out of the blue and then going away only to reappear at a later time after which you find something you didn't know.\\n\\n\r\nThe show suffered from the fact that too much was going on and you didn't get to see the character's motivations. You're also severely limited in the facts you are given and it's hardly fair to the viewer who wants to try and solve the murder along with the main character. Something that most mysteries do is to give you clues or hints along the way that you can reflect on later on and go \"Oooh, I should have SEEN that!\" and kick yourself. Sure they don't share the conclusions drawn by the detective, but you had at least some of the major building blocks and were there when the scene was set and you could figure it out.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't feel that in this show, though I might have missed it because I was too busy feeling too squeamish throughout most of the show to notice, but I felt like they kept more than the fair share of facts, important facts away from us, just to keep the suspense going. Characters who I feel should know more about things mysteriously don't because that would be inconvenient to the plot. \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that annoyed me was how they kept giving some philosophy lectures. \"What is the meaning to be human? What is murder? What is a person? What is love?\" To an extent this did help flavour the show, but it was just one more thing that was distracting from the main focus. I also didn't like a lot of the answers they came up with, which might explain my distaste for this show. \\n\\n\r\nThe relationships and connections were rather vague until nearing the end because that would have possibly tipped us off to what was going on. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I would say skip this anime unless you really like the mystery genre and philosophy. I felt awkward watching the scenes concerning underage sexual activity with a grown relative, the more \"traditional\" romances were weak and I didn't feel they did fair play with the mystery. The reasons why the main character decides to solve the mystery also are somewhat opaque as well.",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nHave you ever thought about the concept of nothing?\r\nNothing means no books, no chairs, no phones. It means no mirrors, no cards, no pillows. Even when all of these physical objects are gone, there is still more to remove. No air, no light, no electromagnetic forces, no atoms, no thoughts.\r\nNo anything.\r\nSubete ga F ni Naru: The Perfect Insider goes the opposite way. \u201cEverything\u201d is just as crazy as \u201cnothing.\u201d Now those books and those pillows and those atoms are around, but that is not enough. Even when you think you collected it all, there isstill more to collect. And then some.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cEverything\u201d means everything to The Perfect Insider. But while it did not collect everything, it still provides a pretty strong anime.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nThe Perfect Insider would, from the outside, appear to be a mystery anime. And this description is true. An unexplainable set of events occur, the characters all work together to find an explanation, and a satisfactory solution is singled out. Over the course of eleven episodes, the anime does just this.\\n\\n\r\nBut from the inside, the anime is that second genre: psychological.\\n\\n\r\nTo be more precise, the anime is philosophical. The mystery acts as a buffer for the philosophical ideas that The Perfect Insider toys with. Questioning \u201cWho are you?\u201d is a common line of thinking for the anime. Discussing the nature of the body versus the soul is where the anime feels safest. Trying to define the concept of freedom or love makes the anime content.\\n\\n\r\nTying each of these ideas together is another idea, one that is the most important to the anime and is another difficult philosophical concept.\\n\\n\r\nDeath.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a surprising amount of death in the show. The death of Dr. Magata\u2019s daughter. The death of her parents. The death of her twin brother and maid. The death of Director Shindou. The death of Nishinosono\u2019s parents. Death surrounds the anime.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of words are said by the The Perfect Insider about death. But, succinctly, the anime comes to its conclusion through Dr. Magata: Death is a cure.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem is in the presentation. The anime barfs all of this information in the audience\u2019s lap within the last two episodes. The other ideas are posited, creating a foundation for the idea of death, but deeper exploration of death happens almost too late. It unfortunately has to be this way: The rest of the season has to focus on the mystery and the positing. Hence, the anime\u2019s philosophical take on death, while wildly interesting, fails to reach the audience in an easily digestible manner.\\n\\n\r\nYet, is that not the point? The philosophical questions are hard to understand because they are, well, hard to understand. Dr. Magata is an anomaly. She thinks in a way that nobody else has ever done before. And, in a way, the audience is not supposed to understand what she is thinking. Because, as Saikawa-sensei aptly and contextually puts it, we are \u201cprogrammed\u201d to think differently from this insane, unique genius.\\n\\n\r\nBut this barf is hard to swallow. Life is a beautiful opportunity. Life gives people fun and places to visit and different hobbies and relationships and information to learn and food worth trekking those extra few minutes to get and anime to watch and happiness. That is, life is (and relevantly) everything.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cA flower wilts for the sake of a new seed\u201d is the anime justifying a child killing its mother. \u201cIsn\u2019t the instinctive desire of beings, born not of their own volition, for their lives to be taken in the same way?\u201d is the anime trying to make the murdering of others appear normal.\\n\\n\r\nThese notions are not justifiable. These notions are not normal. They are ridiculous. They are ridiculous because death is not the answer. Death removes life. And since life is everything, death removes everything. Providing \u2013 by equivalency \u2013 nothing.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond the philosophical themes lays the narrative itself which is comprised of two timelines.\\n\\n\r\nThe first is the present. Here, Nishinosono and Saikawa-sensei work together with the staff of the island laboratory to solve the mystery surrounding them. The second is the past. Here, Director Shindou and Dr. Magata \u2013 as a young teenager \u2013 slowly reveal what happened all those years ago. The past timeline usually appears at the end of most episodes since nearly every scene from the past is filled with suspense and important information. I.e., a cliffhanger.\\n\\n\r\nThis past-and-present technique is simple and common but effective. Having the narrative split, flip-flopping between the present and the past, ramps up the mystery. It helps to make the proceedings more confusing, more unknown to the audience.\\n\\n\r\nYet the anime more or less confuses itself when it commits a big crime of its own: It rarely shows what happened \u201cbehind the scenes.\u201d For example, Dr. Magata and her child are only shown together at the end. Before the end, the audience gets nothing. The audience is not given a view of them in their secluded \u201chome\u201d or an idea of their daily lives or what the child thought of her mother and vice versa.\\n\\n\r\nAnother example is Dr. Magata and Director Shindou. While they have more scenes together than the mother and daughter \u2013 like riding a Ferris wheel or at a hotel \u2013 there are still not enough interactions shown to make their relationship appear worthwhile.\\n\\n\r\nNot having these and the other set of interactions arguably ramps up the mystery further. Which is a nice argument. But it also prevents the audience from fully understanding Dr. Magata and, by extension, the philosophical reasoning she oft leans on.\\n\\n\r\nThe Perfect Insider\u2019s narrative also leans but on a plot contrivance. Later on in the season, a futuristic pod device is introduced. A big problem is that the pod was never mentioned. But even more problematic is what it is used for.\\n\\n\r\nFirst, the pod reveals to Nishinosono a hugely important set of details from her past. And second, the pod gives Nishinosono and Saikawa-sensei the opportunity to speak with Dr. Magata. Because the pod is so restricted in its use, it comes off as too niche. As such, events that should be worthwhile to the narrative come off as overly convenient.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the mystery itself, the anime does well. The details that make up the mystery are rather clever. A pregnancy, hexadecimal code, and imitation of a nonexistent sister keep the audience guessing for the duration of the anime. While it may have been best to actually show Dr. Magata going through some of these actions \u2013 the murder of her daughter, her creating the Trojan code \u2013 what is most important is keeping its events a mystery which The Perfect Insider did.\\n\\n\r\nThe Perfect Insider does come full-circle with its narrative when it references the magic trick and the t-shirts, but there are too many problems beforehand that weigh the anime down.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nActual animation in The Perfect Insider remains relatively average. However, certain actions, like a character speaking or hair billowing or Saikawa-sensei failing to put in his eye drops, prove the anime can heighten its actual animation when it wants to.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless of what level of animation is going on, the anime places extra care in its art, presenting visuals that are almost always meaningful. For example, the art does not just have the characters moving around. The art actively characterizes the cast.\\n\\n\r\nIn one episode. Nishinosono calls her butler back home. When he takes too long in his reply, she gets impatient. The audience sees her impatience plastered on her face and, more strikingly, in the fidgeting of the mouse pointer on the computer screen.\\n\\n\r\nIn the same episode, Saikawa-sensei is smoking a cigarette. (As he always does.) He speaks half of his sentence, inhales some smoke, and then exhales it. As if the smoke cleared his mind, he readjusts what he says.\\n\\n\r\nIn a different episode, Dr. Magata sits in her chair, looking like a doll. It is not until Director Shindou arrives that her face lights up and she begins to animate.\\n\\n\r\nTiny details like these say so much about the characters without resorting to exposition. And the anime uses such subtleties a lot.\\n\\n\r\nTo reiterate, The Perfect Insider contains a lot of expository material in the form of narration and monologues. Furthermore, the anime takes place on one island and (for the most part) within one building. As such, the anime puts as much care into its artistic direction as it does its art. But, rather than adding character depth, these details are designed to engage the audience.\\n\\n\r\nA wonderful example is in the fourth episode. Director Shindou starts with a small bit of narration: \u201cI heard her voice. Or more precisely, their\u2026.\u201d The anime then proceeds to have Dr. Magata, currently a young teenager, speak to herself with her multiple personalities. But rather than just showing her talking to herself, the anime constantly shifts the perspective.\\n\\n\r\nOne perspective positions itself behind Director Shindou. One aims at her from her right side. One faces the mirror in front of her. One sits outside the barely ajar door. The scene does not last long, and the technique is subtle, but the different perspectives mirror the different personalities of Dr. Magata, making it hard to know \u201cwho\u201d is really speaking.\\n\\n\r\nSometimes, these visuals derive from one\u2019s imagination. The purple water in Nishinosono\u2019s nightmare subconsciously reminds her of her purple dress. The cold, enclosed interrogation room for Nishinosono and the warm, open patio for Saikawa-sensei indicate the feelings between these two and Dr. Magata. Dr. Magata and her daughter riding on the back of a camel in the desert evokes a sense of endless discovery for that \u201cperfect answer\u201d the doctor says does not exist.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening track and ending track likewise mire themselves in imagination. The traced dance number in the opening track symbolizes the \u201cdance\u201d the characters have with each other. And the inner guts of some software forming an image of the doctor in the ending track symbolizes the \u201csoftware\u201d that makes up who people are.\\n\\n\r\n(A special shout-out goes to Nishinosono\u2019s small jig in the middle of the opening track. Her body bobbing and head bobbing are strangely alluring.)\\n\\n\r\nMore often than not, however, the visuals ground themselves in reality. Said realism comes from not just the lighting and the setting but also the character designs. People in The Perfect Insider wear regular clothes, varying in eye, nose, and mouth shapes to get at diversity without resorting to crazy.\\n\\n\r\nThe main cast \u2013 Nishinosono, Saikawa-sensei, and Dr. Magata \u2013 are the same, but, as the mains, they have a few extra details. Nishinosono\u2019s short hair and baby face visually paint her as a na\u00efve child. Saikawa-sensei\u2019s many t-shirts signify his \u201cmany eyes\u201d as Dr. Magata puts it. As for Dr. Magata, her white gown represents her \u201cpure\u201d disposition.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the The Perfect Insider leverages its art as much as possible to present a wonderful-looking anime.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nThe Perfect Insider approaches its characters in a strange way.\\n\\n\r\nThe audience learns a bit about Nishinosono, Saikawa-sensei, and Dr. Magata throughout the season. Nishinosono can manipulate large numbers, has a deep affection for Saikawa-sensei, and lost her parents at too young of an age. Saikawa-sensei deals with life in a calm, logical manner, smoking cigarettes and making silly jokes to pass the time. And Dr. Magata slept with her uncle, killed her parents, and hid herself away for fifteen years before reemerging to seek death.\\n\\n\r\nWeirdly, the individual characters do not matter. They neither develop within the narrative nor impact it. What is truly important is the faux love triangle that exists between the three main players: Nishinosono, Saikawa-sensei, and Dr. Magata.\\n\\n\r\nThe whole dynamic is, perhaps obviously, complicated. But the best way to describe it is in terms of getting and understanding. \u201cGetting\u201d means seeing what another is saying. \u201cUnderstanding\u201d means seeing and comprehending what another is saying. That is, one cannot understand another without first getting them, but one can get another without understanding them. (Confused yet?)\\n\\n\r\nAn example. Nishinosono gets Saikawa-sensei. She knows when he is lying. She gets his sense of humor. She tends to know what he thinks. But her love for him, a love she feels is not reciprocated but instead aimed at Dr. Magata, prevents her from completely understanding him. Part of her character arc involves moving closer to the understanding side: learning just how much Saikawa-sensei helped her in the past lets her understand him differently.\\n\\n\r\nYet she cannot get Dr. Magata. She questions the doctor, and she is flabbergasted at how the doctor finds killing her own parents \u2013 when Nishinosono tragically lost her own \u2013 a simple, justifiable move.\\n\\n\r\nSaikawa-sensei completely understands Nishinosono. He knows how to make her laugh. He had been there for her during the lowest point in her life. He accepts her \u201ccontradictions\u201d as he puts it. But, with Dr. Magata, he only gets her. He does not understand her. He admires her for who she is. He gets what she says, but he cannot fully understand her mindset.\\n\\n\r\nDr. Magata, as the flawless character she happens to be, completely understands both Nishinosono and Saikawa-sensei. She understands Nishinosono because of her apathy towards humans, her thinking similar thoughts (as episode two showcases), and her not having parents either. And since Saikawa-sensei has a \u201cvery similar structure,\u201d she understands how he operates, too.\\n\\n\r\nIn summary, Nishinosono gets Saikawa-sensei but does not get Dr. Magata. Saikawa-sensei understands Nishinosono but only gets Dr. Magata. Dr. Magata understands both Nishinosono and Saikawa-sensei. (Still following?)\\n\\n\r\nThe dynamics are complicated. But why? Why create such a convoluted set of dynamics? Why focus so much on their interpersonal connections rather than their intrapersonal selves?\\n\\n\r\nThe Perfect Insider\u2019s narrative bases itself on the answer to this question. The anime is, after all, a mystery. However, the answer finally manifests within the last ten minutes or so of the season.\\n\\n\r\nTwo separate scenes in these last ten minutes are shown. In the real world, Saikawa-sensei recounts a story about Nishinosono\u2019s father. In the imaginary world, Dr. Magata talks with her daughter about humanity. Both conversations revolve around the same theme: questioning and answering.\\n\\n\r\nPeople are constantly questioning. Questioning the world is what drives people forward. And, by extension, people are constantly trying to find answers to these questions. Nishinosono questioned \u201cWhy do people live?\u201d Saikawa-sensei\u2019s answers got her laughing again. Dr. Magata\u2019s daughter questioned herself, so she sought \u201cfreedom.\u201d Dr. Magata questioned Saikawa-sensei in the ocean, and, after hearing his creative response \u2013 \u201cBecause you can\u2019t smoke underwater.\u201d \u2013 she wanted to meet him once more.\\n\\n\r\nDr. Magata phrases it best: \u201cIf they [humans] knew everything, they would attempt nothing. If they attempted nothing, nothing new would happen. Humans seek answers to the things they do not know. That is how kindness, nostalgia, joy, and fun are born.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nIn other words, questioning the world and finding those answers allows people to get, allows people to understand. To get and understand the world, thoughts, and, most importantly, people.\\n\\n\r\nThis directive is The Perfect Insider\u2019s main message. Question others, question ourselves. Only then can answers be found. A \u201cperfect answer,\u201d as Dr. Magata says, may never, ever be discovered. But so long as people question, answers will follow.\\n\\n\r\nIn other words, to understand each other, people simply have to ask, \u201cWho are you?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nAlongside the art, the sound-work of The Perfect Insider is one of its strongest aspects.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening track comes out on top. Its upbeat vibe completely contrasts with the mysterious vibe of the anime, making the track feel even more fun. The vocalist does a wonderful job, too, with the step-wise, quick, and \u201cYea!\u201d lyrics. And, as is pretty much required for a dance song, the track is quite catchy. Made so by the drums, the guitar, and the not-too-fast-and-not-too-slow-but-just-right speed. The OP is a fantastic track that is more than worth listening to both inside and outside of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending track is a step down, but that is not saying all that much. The dual female and male vocalists working together symbolizes Nishinosono and Saikawa-sensei doing the same. The different techno sound-effects fit the computerized motif. The toned-down build-up in the middle. That held lyric. The sudden and not-long-lasting loss of music near the end. All of these details, combined with the catchiness, make the ED into yet another strong track offered by the anime.\\n\\n\r\nNot wanting to be outdone, the rest of the original soundtrack does well too. Tension-filled tracks made up of fast violins and harps. Soft, piano-and-flute tracks for those extremely pleasant moments. And melancholic tracks composed of violins and chimes. These more classical tracks, alongside the more mysterious ones, set up and fit the atmosphere of the anime quite well, making the OST another strong addition to the anime.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting performances are similarly high in execution. Yasuyuki Kase as Saikawa-sensei uses an older, reserved voice that suits the cigarette-loving teacher and that does not get annoying to hear for long periods of time. Atsumi Tanezaki as Nishinosono uses a cute voice that is both mature and young, reflecting the girl\u2019s same disposition. And Ibuki Kido as Dr. Magata has a calm, plain way of speaking. Her voice captures the doctor\u2019s levelheadedness which accentuates her rare, more emotional outbursts.\\n\\n\r\nThe Perfect Insider also deserves huge props for a scene that somewhat came out of nowhere. In episode seven, Saikawa-sensei talks to Dr. Magata\u2019s \u201csister.\u201d The cool part is they both do so in English. The coolest part is that the scene lasts a really long time. And when the audience thinks they are done, they keep going. Cleverly, it distracts the audience from thinking that the \u201csister\u201d is actually Dr. Magata, especially when she speaks in the third person.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nI liked this one. And I certainly appreciated what it did. It might be as opposite to a \u201cturn your brain off\u201d anime as an anime can get. The deep, philosophical questions were (obviously) the reason for this.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime forced me to spend a lot of time dissecting what it was trying to say. While that may be an indicator that the anime delivered its message unsuccessfully \u2013 me literally having to type out their conversations, verbatim, in order to have their exact thoughts close by seems a little absurd \u2013 it gave me the chance to question.\\n\\n\r\nI thought about my own ideals. I thought about the ideals of others. I thought about life and death and myself. Not many anime can make me do that.\\n\\n\r\nThe mystery itself was okay but nothing I was ever taken in by. Mostly because the stakes never felt high, and the payoff was lackluster. Dr. Magata was okay, too. I am not a big fan of perfect characters; I would have liked to have seen her challenged more. The whole point is that she was perfect, but her being so flawless made her less interesting than she could have been.\\n\\n\r\nI did like the \u201cromance\u201d between Nishinosono and Saikawa-sensei, though. Her storming out into the hallway and yelling to herself out of frustration when she learned about Saikawa-sensei staying over at another woman\u2019s (his sister, unbeknownst to Nishinosono) place made me chuckle. Or Nishinosono declaring that she, not Saikawa-sensei\u2019s sister, would be buying his shirts from now on made me laugh. And just the teasing, natural dialogue they shared with each other made me smile on more than a few occasions.\\n\\n\r\nNishinosono herself could be cute and fun, too. Kicking out the female lab worker because she was getting too buddy-buddy with Saikawa-sensei \u2013 \u201cDoor, close!\u201d \u2013 had me laughing since this small act was both funny and true to her personality. And her appearing grossed out by the fact that Saikawa-sensei wanted her to call him an \u201cidiot\u201d had me grinning. A lot of these moments overlapped with her relationship to Saikawa-sensei, but they were, nonetheless, entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nSubete ga F ni Naru: The Perfect Insider has some highs and some lows. More highs than lows. The art and the music are extremely strong, but the story and the characters, despite the philosophy, could have been executed better. In the end, the anime did neither everything nor nothing. But it did, at least, do something.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Bad, while the mystery itself is constructed well, a ridiculous take on death, the lack of important interactions, and an unfortunate plot contrivance each weigh the narrative down\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Great, subtleties, reality, and imaginary come together to create a visually impressive treat\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Fine, Nishinosono, Saikawa-sensei, and Dr. Magata are not strong characters on an individual basis, but their interpersonal relationships nicely explore the theme on questioning and answers\\n\\n\r\nSound: Great, fantastic OP, great ED, nice OST, above average VA performances\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good, the mystery and Dr. Magata were okay, Nishinosono and Saikawa-sensei, especially Nishinosono, were fun, and it forced self-reflection\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 7/10",

            "content": "The accusation of being 'pretentious' has been lobbed at Subete ga F ni Naru quite often. This is unfair, considering the author actually worked as a researcher for quite a while. The integration of maths and computer science elements into the story is basic (in concession to the audience) but does bring a unique flavour into what would otherwise be a standard locked room mystery. The story starts off slowly, setting up the characters and story with dry factual dialogue, but as events unfold, more elements are added to the mystery and the relationship between Moe and Souhei becomes more fleshed out, leading to somemore compelling drama in the second half. Magata Shiki's past also adds an edge and strangeness to the story that fans of psychological anime will appreciate.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the story is good, Subete ga F ni Naru's problem is that it follows the structure of the novel too closely, or at least it appears that way from someone who never read it. The setting and events are static, and with mature, realistic characters, even with the same script it feels this would be better realised in live action with good actors. The pacing is also a tad too slow; where 'show, don't tell' is an important principle in literature it is surely doubly important in television. The drab colour palette visually reinforces this impression, although by and large the audiovisual quality of this series is very good, with very expressive facial animation in important scenes.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a straight, compelling mystery told through the anime medium, Subete ga F ni Naru is the show for you. Just don't expect much more out of it than you could get from a book.",

            "content": "So I first decided to watch this show based off a recommendation from a Youtuber and I'm really glad I decided to give it a go. If you're looking for a true mystery anime this is the one to try. \r\nStory: (9/10) The story was one of the things that impressed me the most about this anime. It starts out with Nishinosono Moe and her professor Saikawa Souhei who are both fans of the work of Dr. Magata Shiki, a scientist who has been living in complete isolation on an island for 15 years. Not only is she all alone but she ultimately hasn't lefther room let alone the laboratory she's been living in. Moe and Souhei decide that they want to go to meet Dr. Shiki in person but when they arrive they encounter more than one murder. \\n\\n\r\nAt first when watching this show, I was actually pretty bored. You would think, \"Wow they walk into a murder scene, must be pretty intense!\" But the first few episodes are super talky, for lack of a better turn and I found myself fighting to keep my attention on it. I actually briefly considered dropping the show, but something told me I should stick it out, and boy am I glad I did. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the best things about this show is its pacing. Of the mystery anime I've seen, many of them take you on a wild goose chase of crazy outlandish mysteries that really don't even have anything to do with the main plot. Not Perfect Insider. Even though the show starts out slow the build up to the resolution of the mystery is handled excellently.  It reveals little pieces of information episode by episode and avoids the all too common flood of information squeezed into the last few episodes, which I absolutely loved. Other than the pacing the story itself is just darn good. Just when you think you know what's going on, it twists in ways that you weren't expecting. Once the ball gets rolling, Perfect Insider keeps the viewer on their toes and makes them think throughout the whole series. The only thing that keeps me from giving the story a 10/10 is the fact that it got a little confusing in parts and I wished for a little bit more explanation. But overall an excellent story.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10 The art and animation style in Perfect Insider was very unique! The character designs weren't you're typical kawaii, big eyed stereotypical anime characters. The people were designed more realistically than a lot that I've seen. The colors in this show were sometimes a bit bland but it fit the overall serious tone of the show, so I don't feel that it took away from anything.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10 I'm giving this a perfect 10 because I really liked the opening and ending songs, especially the opening. As far as the soundtrack, it really fit the serious and dark tone that was woven throughout the story. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10 The characters in Perfect Insider were fairly well developed. But I wished for a little more on the two lead characters that I just didn't get. I wanted to know more about what made them tick, how they got to where they were. That being said we do get a bit of background on them towards the end which is great. As far as how likable they are it's 50/50. I sometimes liked them and sometimes they got on my nerves. I guess it just depends on what they were doing at the time. The reason I gave this category an 8 instead of a bit lower though was because of one character and that was Dr. Magata Shiki. She is probably one of the most brilliant characters I've seen written. You go into this series knowing that she's a genius but genius doesn't even being to cover it. I can't say much more than that without giving away major plot points, but you'll have to take my word on it. She's a well thought out character and the reason the plot is so great. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment: 8/10 I've pretty much covered in the other sections why I enjoyed this anime. I love something that keeps me guessing what's going to happen next. Not only guess but actually care about the ending. As also previously stated, the only reason that this isn't ranked a little higher is because this show could be really confusing at times especially if you aren't paying super close attention. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10 Even though my individual category scores are higher, I still give Perfect Insider a 7. This is only simply because while every thing I said above is true, it's probably not a show that I would buy on DVD or watch again other than maybe to get some clarification. That being said, I believe that Perfect Insider is very impressive for its mystery genre which can sometimes fall flat. Definitely give this one a shot. \\n\\n\r\nI would just like to add as a disclaimer that I am in no way any sort of anime expert. I just like to add my opinion on shows I've watched :)",

            "content": "It\u2019s not easy to watch a show like \u201cThe Perfect Insider\u201d. Generally speaking, the show is about mystery and in this case involves murder. It\u2019s something that can be a sensitive topic as we learn more about the circumstances. And given the mystery aspect of the show, it\u2019s the narratives that captures the essence of story. Really though, what is The Perfect Insider? \r\nSubete ga F ni Naru (also more commonly known as The Perfect Insider) is based on a Japanese mystery novel written in 1996 by Hiroshi Mori. Produced by A-1 Pictures, the show is symbolic for how mystery can be so\u2026mysterious. The settingtakes place on a remote island and begins when Souhei Saikawa, an associate professor of National Nagono University, goes on a vacation there. During his vacation, he is also accompanied by 1st year student, Moe Nishinosono. What started out as an ordinary trip turns bizarre when a mysterious corpse shows up at the lab. At the same time, it also became well known that a woman named Shiki Magata lives there. As one of the most mysterious characters in the show, she has literally lived in a laboratory for the past 15 years. Can you imagine that? Trapping themselves like a rat in a box hardly sounds like a paradise. For someone like Magata, there\u2019s also a dark past that involves the parricide of her parents. It\u2019s the establishment of these three characters that makes The Perfect Insider a dark and grimy tale.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s a very talky show. The first episode has an immense amount of philosophical vibe that follows with its heavy dialogues. The character interactions between Moe/Magata and Moe/Souhei can be described as cryptic. There\u2019s some lighthearted humor as well but mostly follow a suit of dark comedy. When they reach the island, there\u2019s also more of an experimental feeling as if there\u2019s something that\u2019s hidden there. It\u2019s not long before they discover the grim truth there. What the show also concentrates a bit on is the background story of Shiki Magata. Obviously, she isn\u2019t a normal woman by the way she talks or behaves. The bits of past we see implies that she is an unstable child although her actions are difficult to decipher because of her personality. [spoiler]This includes her involvement with the death of her parents as well as the perverse relationship she forges with her uncle.[/spoiler] I think at some point, viewers may find it unsettling with what they witness. And that\u2019s no surprise either considering how much we learn that Magata is far from normal.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the series, there are many clues that has connections with the murder case. It\u2019s also apparent that some of the clues are presented through intentional means. One of the most prominent is a message called \u2018Everything Becomes F\u2019, which is also synonymous with the series\u2019 alternate title. What\u2019s more about the clues is that they are all seems to be related to Shiki Magata. What I find the show intriguing is how each episode\u2019s performance triggers events that correlates with one another. Even the episode titles has some sort of meaning or is symbolic with the storytelling. Some sensitive topics are used as plot devices and while can be unsettling is important to establish Magata\u2019s character. On a weaker note, the show has a slow pacing, one that I think can really test the patience of viewers. Furthermore, the story is structured in a way that explores both Moe and Magata in almost parallel ways. As the story progresses, we also learn a bit more about Moe as well. While her personality is not similar to Magata or Souhei, something suggests that her past isn\u2019t as bright as some people have hoped.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character interactions of the show is expressed by the building tension and relations one draws from another. Moe\u2019s conversation with Souhei can be interpreted from many angles but it\u2019s obvious that he shows a great deal of bizarre interest in Magata. Moe\u2019s interest with Souhei also crafts a bizarre relationship angle as Magata shows unusual interest in Moe. It\u2019s a really weird way of presenting the story and I\u2019d have to advise to watch the show with an open mind. Not just because of the main characters but also for some of the more mature and sensitive topics. Otherwise, this is probably a show that is not worth the investment especially considering how talkative it is. There\u2019s still also some minor comedy although mostly is far eclipsed by the thrilling feeling of its mystery.\\n\\n\r\nFor a mystery show, it also invests a decent amount of time with its unusual artwork. There\u2019s a hollow feeling that anyone can draw from its backgrounds. Most characters are also designed to look simple without unusual features. Well, that is until you see Makata Shiki. Additionally, the show portrays its mystery with symbolism and disorder. The clues translates into a more detailed form of analysis such as the message Magata left behind or more prominent features Moe herself discovers later on in the show. To put it simply, artwork is unorthodox but also stylistically fitting for a show like this.\\n\\n\r\nI have to admit a bit, the soundtrack is surprisingly impressive. From the unusual execution of the OP song (that features rotoscope done effectively) to the thrilling atmosphere, each episode offers what mystery should be. More intensified scenes are also adapted with quietness to add on more to the thrilling suspense. In addition, character voice mannerisms has a profound tone of philosophy behind them. In particular, Souhei speaks with intelligence and purpose and that\u2019s something I find quite compelling. Unfortunately, this doesn\u2019t seem to apply to Moe as she can be legitimately frustrating to watch with someone of her personality. And of course, there\u2019s Magata. Her conversation portrayed in the show through that near-sinister like voice really can feel mysterious.\\n\\n\r\nThe Perfect Insider is a show with some unique dynamics even in the mystery genre. From disturbing plot devices to insightful conversations, it\u2019s a series that goes beyond just a simple murder case. It becomes complex with its dark themes, the riveting style of the storytelling, and heavy characterization. The first three episodes will probably be a make or break for most viewers. But if you manage to stay, it\u2019ll be a thrilling ride that is not short of perfect.\\n",

            "content": "The Perfect Insider is what I would like to call the first 'proper' mystery anime I've seen in quite some time. By 'proper' I don't mean to say that it's amazing per se, but that it actually follows the best story design for the genre. That is to say, it takes its time to give the viewers all the details you could ever ask for as well as plenty of red herrings, it doesn't blatantly break the rules of detective fiction like certain other recent works, and it is also not episodic in any way. It gives you a fair chance to reflect on thecase at hand and try to figure out the problem on your own, and it doesn't try to include any needless supernatural elements in the process. It's just 11 episodes of content all dedicated to a single in-depth mystery, and as a result it actually feels like a traditional detective story. It's simple, but very effective.\\n\\n\r\nBased on a mystery novel of the same name from 1996, The Perfect Insider follows the cryptic death of a genius computer scientist named Magata Shiki, who has been locked up in an isolated research facility on an island for the last 15 years after having been accused of murdering her own parents as a teenager. Nishinosono Moe, a rich young lady, and the university professor Saikawa Souhei travel together to the island with the hopes of meeting Shiki in person, only to find her dead inside her room upon arriving, with her arms and legs cut off. Based on the guards' testimony as well as the security camera footage, it is clear that no one else ever entered or left Shiki's quarters. So who killed her, how and why? Those are the main questions which the story revolves around. In other words, at heart it's a classic 'locked room' problem. Though that's not all there is to it since as you'll find out, the case only escalates even further from that point onwards...\\n\\n\r\nNow since mysteries are very spoiler-sensitive I don't really want to say anything more than that about the story, but I can at least say that while the overall plotline didn't exactly blow my mind... I still found it very satisfying. The most important part of a good mystery is to give the viewers a fair chance at figuring out the problem before the truth is revealed, and The Perfect Insider does a good job at that. Part of the solution is actually not that difficult to figure out on your own, but the whole thing? Yeah I don't think very many people were able to do that, but it all made sense when I finally heard the explanation, and that's all I can really ever ask for.\\n\\n\r\nShiki herself is unquestionably the most interesting character of the anime as is made evident when the others slowly but surely come to realize who she used to be whilst investigating the case. She's crazy, but unbelievably intelligent. As far as Saikawa-sensei and Moe goes though... I can't help but feel like they're utilized more as plot mechanics than actual persons. Saikawa-sensei quite simply fulfills the role of the detective of the case. To quote one of the 20 rules of detective fiction: \"The detective novel must have a detective in it; and a detective is not a detective unless he detects. His function is to gather clues that will eventually lead to the person who did the dirty work in the first chapter; and if the detective does not reach his conclusions through an analysis of those clues, he has no more solved his problem than the schoolboy who gets his answer out of the back of the arithmetic.\" And that is effectively all he does: logically solving the problem, one step at a time. Beyond that he's honestly a quite bland and uninspiring character, but at least he fulfills the role that the story has given him very well. Moe on the other hand is the intermediary character who  is there to ensure that the viewers are able to follow along and don't get confused, by not being quite as sharp as Saikawa-sensei is, and thus making him have to explain most of his discoveries vocally to her, thus indirectly informing the audience in the process as well. And all the other side characters... well they're mostly just 'there', not a whole lot more to say about them.\\n\\n\r\nThe Perfect Insider is produced by A-1 Pictures of all studios, which is pretty unexpected in and of itself since this is hardly the kind of series they usually adapt. They pretty much always make shounen anime, but this time they're tackling a philosophical seinen mystery instead. But either way, they do a surprisingly good job at it, and the animation is as top notch as ever as well. Something that might be worth mentioning here as well is that the character designs are actually made by Asano Inio, the mangaka of Oyasumi Punpun and Solanin among other things. And although The Perfect Insider perhaps doesn't look *that* crazy relatively speaking, you can still really see who the artist is. It's just too characteristic to be unnoticeable.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, The Perfect Insider might be very dialogue-heavy and slow-paced, but I still found significantly more consistent enjoyment value in this anime than almost anything else from this season, mostly because it actually feels like a real mystery for once. Like a legitimately interesting one which teases your imagination and makes you think for yourself. It's surprising just how rare that is to see in anime, but it means quite a lot to me. So even though the mystery in this case might not have been completely flawless, it's still a hell of a lot better than getting nothing at all. I'll just take what I can get.",

Agree or disagree I will give you my 2 cents about this series.\r\nI will start with first with the [b]Characters[/b].\r\nIf you don't like 'different/perfect' characters, you won't enjoy the show.\r\nOur lead protagonist Saikawa is a professor at a college but his personality is anythingbut normal, he is very anti social and spends his time thinking about the way humans think and why they think that way. He is curious why people do many things for no reason. \\n\r\nHis mentality is detached from society's typical way of thinking, the way he questions anything and everything would make most people in society look at him like he was crazy. I personally saw his statements as realistic questions to be asked. \\n\\n\r\n\"Every morning I wake up and think am I the same Saikawa I was yesterday? Or am I just trying to play the role of Saikawa?\".  \\n\\n\r\n\"In here it feels like we've been abandoned by time.\"\\n\r\n\"Isn't 'released from' a better phrase as opposed to 'abandoned by'\"\\n\\n\r\n\"Seeing nature and thinking its beautiful is what is unnatural\"\\n\\n\r\n\"In the end, everybody is tied down to their one body, don't you find that terribly restrictive?\"\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed his character because he would say things no other main character would say. Which was something great to me.  \\n\\n\r\nFemale lead protagonist Moe, a math genius who can answer any math question immediately, she is also an unusual character, she isn't quite as curious as Saikawa when it comes humans but she tags along with him. Her above average intellect helps conversations with this unusual male lead to make some sense. Saikawa can't talk to somebody who refuses to share the same train of though. \\n\\n\r\nLastly the main focus of the series, is a woman who is a super genius named Magata. She is world famous for being super smart at the age of 11 and thus they locked her in a room so that she can work alone, for 15 years. Her character is similar to that of Saikawa in that she  questions the human train of thought and emotions. Her train of thought is similar to Saikawa as well.\\n\\n\r\nIf you can't stand 'different/perfect' characters with drastic world views then do not watch this show. \\n\\n\r\n[b]Story[/b]\\n\\n\r\nThe two leads go to the island where the famous Dr. Magata works, and the fact that Moe's family is well known, they are let in upon arriving. When they  enter a murder is committed where the limbs of the body are missing. Although Saikawa prefers to leave Moe convinces him to stay and help figure out this murder mystery. \\n\r\nNot much to say about it in general except, I felt that the revelation of the murder and how they get there is enjoyable. The reasoning behind the murder might be acceptable for you depending on what kind of person are you. Like I said before the characters mainly determine how your enjoyment of this series will go.\\n\\n\r\n[b]Sound[/b] \\n\\n\r\nGreat fantastic awesome whatever. The music was great in this series OP and ED. One of the best of this season. If a great ost is enough to get you to watch a series then this is your show.\\n\\n\r\n[b]Art[/b]\\n\r\nThe art wasn't bad. The only thing that bothered me is the way they drew everybody's eyebrowss, and occasionally how some of the characters eyes looked. Other than that the art was good.\\n\\n\r\n[b]Enjoyment[/b]\\n\r\nEnjoyment was great, probably my favorite show of the season. If you think that OPM is the anime of the season, then I recommend you to avoid this show like the plague. \\n\\n\r\n[b]In Conclusion[/b]\\n\r\nSubete ga F ni Naru is a show that requires your undivided attention, missing the smallest of details can change how you view it. I don\u2019t blame you for not liking it. It is a metaphysical journey that\u2019s more about exploring its concepts than anything. It isn\u2019t meant to be taken at face value and demands you to pay attention to understand it. It\u2019s a show that touches upon the human condition and finding one\u2019s purpose in life. I suggest watching lesser complicated shows before trying to tackleSubete again. Subete is an anime made for people who understand philosophy and also have a keen understanding on how to properly analyze content.",

            "content": "So here we are. The final noitamina show of 2015. Can\u2019t say I\u2019ve been a big fan of the time slot\u2019s constant deaths and revivals to the point that Jean Grey is thinking there\u2019s something wrong with it, and considering that nobody likes The Perfect Insider but people who seem to think that good dialogue automatically equals quality, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to be breaking many hearts when I say that I\u2019m not exactly enthusiastic about having to review the show. But hey, regardless of quality, I think most of us can agree it\u2019s still worth talking about. Not to mention, I get toslap those \u201cnovel adaptations are always good\u201d heathens around, so win/win.\\n\\n\r\nBased on the third or fourth novel in the S&M (Sohei and Moe) series - which I haven\u2019t read, but The Perfect Insider seems to assume its audience has because it doesn\u2019t even bother to tell us who our two leads are - the anime stars our two title characters as they head to an island retreat for a university vacation where thanks to the almighty god that is the mystery writer, a murder happens Detective Conan-style and the two must figure out what\u2019s going on. The series also has a live-action drama that was criticized for being slow-paced, but upon further research, I discovered it actually adapts five novels worth of material within its ten-episode run, which makes me wonder just what the fuck is in these novels that makes them such a tedious chore even when you only have an hour or so to tell the story. Yes it should come to no surprise considering it\u2019s A-1, but for an 11-episode series The Perfect Insider is ridiculously long. And it doesn\u2019t even have any uninspired world-building to fall back on as an excuse. It\u2019s just long for no good reason whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing about mysteries is that once you know the truth behind \u2018em, they cease to be \u201cmysteries\u201d and instead become uninteresting. As such, the bad ones generally rely on the brain-teasing to entice the audience whilst the good ones tie the mystery into other things in order to stay relevant in the long run. Maybe explore the personalities of our main characters. Rope the mystery into some larger plot. Have the villain be a well-respected figure who was turned into a bad guy for no good reason. Basically do everything Paranoia Agent did. You\u2019ll be pleased to hear that not only does Perfect Insider not do any of these things, but the mystery itself doesn\u2019t even make sense. It\u2019s like the guy who was adapting the source material realized he ordered too many timeslots, but rather than actually add anything to the adaptation like, say, telling us who the fuck Sohei and Moe are, he just turned on an episode of Monogatari, became engaged in what he was seeing, and yelled \u201cbrilliant!\u201d And then he saw the mystery made no sense in the novel and went \u201coh who the fuck cares?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s so much boring redundant dialogue in this show that it takes three episodes for the mystery to even fucking start. And even with the long stretches of time spent on talking me to sleep, the show is incredibly lacking in detail. The characters react to deaths the same way a normal person would react to a mosquito bite, and everyone gets free rein of the place like they don\u2019t care that there\u2019s a murderer among them to the point that it felt like they were reading the script. Not to mention that what little we see of the victim\u2019s history does a pretty good job at making me glad that she\u2019s dead because she\u2019s fucking psychotic. Maybe it\u2019s just me, but I find it hard to sympathize with someone who\u2019d kill their family out of nowhere whilst looking like she inhaled two bags of coke. And explain to me where all that AI stuff came from and what it added to the story besides a load of bananas.\\n\\n\r\nWith that said, the show\u2019s total commitment to treating fucked-up relationships and psychic programs as a normal thing was entertaining at points, mainly because it kept making me laugh. Well, not \u201claugh\u201d persay. More like snicker at the idea that someone can say that children grow to kill their parents at the age of fifteen like it\u2019s a normal thing to happen. I guess now we know what happened to all the parents in every single highschool anime ever, amirite? Unfortunately, the amount of unintentionally hilarious dialogue is in a vast minority compared to the ones that are either spouting exposition or talking about Moe\u2019s desires to bone her teacher silly. Which is also kind of unintentionally hilarious in a way. I guess spouting out quantum physics when someone asks you where the rewind button on the Xbone controller is located is considered sexy to some people.\\n\\n\r\nMy point is this: shows that try to get by on dialogue alone are shit. Because animation is a visual medium and not using the visuals to tell the story is like not having gameplay in your video game. That\u2019s right, The Perfect Insider is the anime version of those walking simulator games. The ones where you play as some nameless being trying to find the plot without any challenge in-between the exposition dumps to the point that it feels like you\u2019re reading a book that was chopped into pieces and scattered across the world so that it takes an awfully long time and money to figure out how the story ends. Forgive me for being old-fashioned, but when I buy a book, I prefer to have the entire thing at my disposal and not have to buy a new chapter every time I go to a new book store. If I had to do that, Huckleberry Finn would have taken three years to finish reading.\\n\\n\r\nPlus, why should I care about the dialogue when it\u2019s being spoken by a bunch of dull drama stereotypes with no personal story or stakes in the mystery whatsoever? Did anyone ever watch LA Confidential and thought it would have been improved if you replaced Guy Pearce with some random kid genius who has no connection with the police force and just said what the audience was thinking whilst discovering the dead body underneath the house? Of course not. Because that kid would have been really fucking boring! I don\u2019t watch anime to see people react to things. I watch anime to see people doing things. And I can\u2019t remember one thing Sohei and Moe ever did besides wonder what was going on and then eventually figure out the truth in one long info-dump before going about their lives.\\n\\n\r\nI mean did this experience change them? Did they go through any character growth throughout the series? Did they have any personal connection with the victim? I remember Moe talking with her once and that was it. Why exactly are Sohei and Moe the main characters if they\u2019re not going to affect the story? Even Benedict Cumberbatch had to match personal wits with the otherwise-unconnected criminals he faces at the end of each episode of Sherlock.\\n\\n\r\nFair warning to all my readers. I\u2019m going to spoil the plot of this show now, because I can\u2019t get deep into its silliness otherwise. After more than eight episodes of exposition-dumping along with one really bad Engrish scene that grated my ears harder than the voice-acting in a post-90s Sonic game, the show decides to reveal through several overly long and tensionless exposition scenes that absolutely none of the characters we met along the way was the culprit and that the person they thought was the victim was actually a look-alike who killed herself because fifteen years of planning couldn\u2019t stand up to the words that came out of Moe\u2019s mouth. The original plan was to have both the intended victim and her husband killed because they lived fucked up lives and apparently this is their way of seeking redemption rather than - oh, I don\u2019t know - turning themselves in. Instead, the intended murderer killed herself, the intended victim escapes the island, she shows up one last time to tell Sohei that she won\u2019t get caught, we get a final episode consisting of nothing but tying up loose ends rather than giving me some actual payoff, and then the show ends with a scene consisting of the intended victim and the actual victim talking about the meaning of life.\\n\\n\r\nSo in other words, assuming that load of boring plot dump doesn\u2019t put you to sleep, the only character who gets any sort of resolution out of this ridiculously long mystery is the unlikeable and uninteresting murderer we barely got to know, and it\u2019s an incredibly anticlimactic one as well. Somewhere in Hell, Albert Wesker from Resident Evil is watching this show (and I have it on good authority that Satan allows his followers to watch anime in Hell) and going \u201cdude, I was treated with more dignity than this. And I was killed by a muscleman and his incredibly stupid black sidekick who\u2019d waste valuable health sprays on you if you so much as got a paper cut.\u201d",

            "content": "\"The natural state of things is death, so life itself is a sort of illness. When the illness is cured, life vanishes.\" Shiki Magata\r\n(This is just a brief touch of the pretense contained in this show) \r\n- The Perfect Insider - \r\nStory: 5\r\nThe biggest issue with Perfect Insider's story isn't the mystery itself, no- the biggest issue plaguing this show is the Anime Logic\u2122. Apparently Hiroshi Mori didn't even bother to do a cursory search for any kind of legal books, case law, or anything regarding the legality of murder and subsequent judicial proceedings of someone accused and convicted of such. \r\nIn his stead, Idid my own research, which turned up some very strange findings. Case law for Japan is very difficult to find, and even more rare in English; however, the cases that are involved are typically public information, excepting those involving minors- similarly to the US. \\n\\n\r\nIn Japan, they do not follow the M'naghten rule- that is, in an insanity plea, where the distinction must be made of a person who is accused of a crime as to whether they were insane at the time of the CRIME, or insane at the time of the TRIAL. The goal is to determine whether temporary insanity or claims of insanity to try and get off are valid. If someone is determined insane at the time of the trial, the trial is then postponed and they are involuntarily committed to a mental institution until such a time that they are deemed competent to stand trial, if ever. Time spent in said asylum counts as time served in the event that they are convicted after being found competent. \\n\\n\r\nIn 2001, a man in Osaka went into an elementary school and stabbed 8 children to death, and injured another 13 children and two teachers. He was diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder, BPD, and PPD. He was sentenced to death by hanging, and it was carried out in 2004. \\n\\n\r\nIn 2007, a 16 year old girl murdered her father with an axe in Kyoto. Because the case involved a minor, few details are available, but it's almost certain that she walked free. \"I didn't like my father so I killed him,\" Kyodo news agency quoted the girl as saying. \\n\r\n-Japan allows this kind of thing.\\n\\n\r\nIn 2008, a man drove a truck into a crowd in Akihabara and killed three people, got out, stabbed and killed four more, injuring an additional 10 people before being apprehended. He was then RELEASED FROM POLICE CUSTODY after two days, and rearrested 10 DAYS LATER. He was sentenced to death in 2011, upheld in 2015. \\n\\n\r\nWhat Japan does (because of deep seated cultural norms and customs, along with having no actual laws pertaining to the matter of mentally ill committing violent crime), as evidenced in the aforementioned cases, is seemingly either A) put them to death, or B) let them walk free. \\n\\n\r\nApparently Hiroshi Mori was aware of B) and kept that in mind when writing Perfect Insider, with a healthy dose of Anime Logic\u2122 to keep it firmly on the side of \"That's some crap\". Dr. Shiki Magata manages to not only get away with the double murder of her parents (be declared not competent to stand trial and 'released to the care of her family' {as per Japanese law}), but then be allowed to walk free and live inside of a laboratory for 15 years. Never mind that this lab is not monitored by the police and government, a total lack of oversight over a dangerous, mentally ill AND unstable criminal, but that she's also able to open the door HERSELF and leave, were it to come to that. \\n\\n\r\nAbout 200 years ago, a guy named Ed Allan wrote a story about how to imprison someone you don't want leaving... it involved some bricks and a little bit of wine. Bottom line is, if they didn't want Shiki to escape, why the hell would they build a door to her \"cell\" that SHE can open? That's just plain stupid. You don't give prisoners a key to their cell when they go to jail. \\n\\n\r\nThe next bit of ridiculous anime logic is how, once Dr. Magata escapes, she's instantaneously wanted by the police. Oh, now that she's not in her little laboratory that she ran herself, she's now wanted? What are they going to do when they arrest her this time? Slap on the wrist, walk free again? What purpose does this serve? \\n\r\nThere was a tiny scene showing her arraignment in court, and the apparent release implied thereafter. I don't know what's more insane, Japan's laws on mentally ill persons committing violent crimes like murder, or Dr. Magata. \\n\\n\r\nThe detective characters also overlook so many obvious clues that I nearly smashed my frontal bone completely in two with my palm. They also take everything that the workers at the lab say at face value, including ridiculous absolutes like \"it's IMPOSSIBLE for anything to be wrong with the computer system\", or \"this door can NEVER be opened\", or \"NO ONE EVER has come or gone from here\", and others. There wouldn't be a mystery if these absolutes were true, so why they continue to stick to them and the protagonists believe them is beyond me. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 4\\n\\n\r\nOnto our characters, Saikawa is one of the edgiest level 98 Glorious Edgemaster  of Balrons ever. He's edgier than stepping on a Lego, barefoot (which also feature prominently in this show- product placement, hah!). This guy is the ultimate form of cool. He's got the look- long shaggy mop hair that hangs over one eye like a 15 year old scene kid, the only thing that he's missing is the dyed edge of his hair and eye makeup, which he makes up for by having two black eyes because he's too edgy to sleep, because sleeping might take away time from his infinitely deep philosophical musings. He wears shirts with sarcastic phrases or esoteric images on them that only further deepen this mystique he's trying to build. Which really just means that he doesn't care about his appearance because such things are beneath him. Saikawa also smokes incessantly, because smoking just further increases your cool points.\\n\\n\r\nSaikawa exists in the show mostly to spout off pseudo intellectual BS that can be found any day of the week on the hot list of r/iam14andthisisdeep. In fact, this page was probably inspired by the original 1996 Perfect Insider novel. His musings include, but are not limited to: the meaning of life, the meaning of death, the meaning of love, and many other answerless questions. His powers include: a deep and unexplained understanding of programming languages, BS skills like no other, and being a tough guy who resists cute girls for no other reason than that he's just too far advanced in knowledge and understanding to be trifled with such foolish things. \\n\\n\\n\r\nNishinosono: \\n\\n\r\nShe exists in the show to attempt to give a more human feel to the robotic Saikawa, and to have someone in the show that's stupid and doesn't get it, and so in having it explained to them, the audience also gets the developments going on in Saikawa's head. Other than that, Nishinosono's presence is to blush anytime someone mentions Saikawa's name, and generally fawn over him and how edgy he is. \\n\\n\r\nThese characters in Perfect Insider are the dumbest smart people I've ever seen. Mr. Mori seemingly was never told \"show, not tell\"- which is rule #1 in characterization. I don't care how many times you beat me over the head with Nishinosono telling Saikawa how smart he is, or how observant or technologically proficient he is, or the same apparent attributes of Dr. Magata. I don't have any idea why Saikawa or Nishinosono are supposedly such brilliant people, as I've no indication of their backgrounds or lives outside of what little we're shown in flashbacks. I know that Saikawa is an educated man because he's a professor of architecture, but that does not explain his seemingly boundless knowledge of the various technologies and workings of a so called \"genius\"- Dr. Magata. \\n\\n\r\nFor the icing on the stupid cake, the mystery is finally solved with a really bad deus ex machina, whereas the rest of the tale was unraveled using semi-to-realistic logic and things that can actually happen. Suffice to say that some characters get into some Tranquility Lane style virtual reality loungers and manage to find what they were looking for. A real cop out of a way to \"solve\" the mystery. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall: 4, 5\\n\\n\r\nIt makes me sad to learn that Kenji Kawai did the soundtrack for this pile, because it was utterly forgettable. Honestly, this isn't the worst series of the season, but as far as being a mystery, it's far too reliant on conveniences and longshots in an shallow attempt at appearing deep. I had figured out about 80% of the mystery by the 5th or 6th episode, and it was all downhill from there, with a really forgettable cast of characters and a hokey ending.",

            "content": "The Perfect Insider is a great example of how fast an interesting premise can turn into a bad story. If you came to this anime looking for an interesting and intellectual show, then I would advise you to look somewhere else. \r\nSTORY\r\nThis show started out with an interesting premise. The premise being that a genius programmer Shiki Magata is murdered within a locked room on an isolated island. This becomes a game of cat and mouse, as our two main characters (or protagonists) search around for clues to the mystery. While I hyped the premise initially, the actual progression/execution of the show was lackluster tosay the least. The answer to the mystery was rather predictable, but I was hoping that the execution would be better. The themes were simply not explored enough and most of dialogue seem unneeded or unnatural. In fact most of the show consists of poorly written dialogue, with very slow pacing and annoying plot holes/plot conveniences. This show tries to bombard you with pseudo-intellectualism, rather than actual facts, logic or interesting logistical questions. \\n\\n\r\nEven when a noteworthy question is asked, it is quickly overshadowed by other non-sense within the show. In some cases, the question is not even related to the problem at hand. In other situations, the answers are very left field or do not even answer the question. However, the final episode was very well written. Unlike previous episodes many interesting questions were proposed and answered. We gain a bit more understanding of Shiki Magata; however, one episode does not make up for the entirety of the show. The plot just contains a lot of lazy writing, pseudo-intellectualism and moments of huge info dumping.  \\n\\n\r\n\"Every human starts as a genius. And as they age, they become average.\"- Shiki Magata\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nAll of the characters are surprisingly flat, which is shocking coming from a dialogue heavy show. Many of their motivations, fears, or dreams are stripped away. We are left with dull 2-dimensional characters, with no additional interesting information or talents about them. There are three main characters: \\n\r\nSouhei Saikawa:\\n\r\nAngsty, pseudo-intellectual main character, who solves the mystery with almost little to no insight. Most of his rants have nothing to do with the actual plot, and his moments of \u201cgenius\u201d are ass-pulls.\\n\\n\r\nShiki Magata: \\n\r\nGenius, yet psychotic programmer, with the foresight of a time wizard. There\u2019s almost no motivation for this character and no personality either. She\u2019s merely a plot device, nothing more or less.\\n\\n\r\nMoe Nishinosono:\\n\r\nYoung side kick who obsesses over Souhei. She\u2019s just a hollow placeholder for the audience to project their views and feelings through, while they watch the show. \\n\\n\r\nART/ANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nThe art is typical, nothing new in this department; however, the animation can be a bit sloppy at some points. For anime built around dialogue, many of the scenes were often animated badly. There were many jump cuts and some seriously awkward camera angles.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND/OST\\n\\n\r\nThis is where Subete redeems itself. The OST was rather fitting for the type of narrative created. It added to the atmosphere and overall progression of the show. The opening and ending songs were very well done. The opening was very catchy. The ending song keeps and maintains this upbeat feeling, unlike most ending songs of today. The voice acting was spot on, I have no complaint in this section. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\\n\r\nThe Perfect Insider is a mediocre at best. No matter how interesting a premise is, if the execution and characters cannot match, then the show simply fails. Subete unfortunately bit off more than it could chew, which caused it to resort to pseudo-intellectualism blurs rather than creating logic/interesting dialogue and characters. I would say to try another show before you watch Subete ga F ni Naru: The Perfect Insider.\\n\\n\r\nFINAL GRADE\\n\r\nD\\n",

            "content": "Synopsis on Crunchyroll: Based on the award-winning novel Subete ga F ni Naru by Hiroshi Mori, The Perfect Insider finds Sohei Saikawa, a member of the Saikawa Research Lab, and Moe Nishinosono, the daughter of his mentor, on vacation when they discover a corpse. The two then work together to solve the mysteries of what becomes a serial murder case. \r\nI don't normally write reviews, but I had to make an exception for this show since I'm not too sure that many people are quite getting its meaning. For people who are currently on the fence trying to decide whether or not to watch PerfectInsider, please do not take the current aggregate score on MyAnimeList as an indicative measurement of the overall quality. The anime is simply different, not bad; and, to be quite frank, it takes an open mind and different kind of thinking towards plot progression to appreciate what is being done here. \\n\\n\r\nThe first and foremost aspect of the plot that must be addressed is that it does NOT primarily belong to the mystery genre. I can not stress this enough. If you start watching this anime thinking that it will have a conventional mystery plotline, such as Sherlock Holmes, then you will be severely disappointed by the outcome. For instance, the \"mystery\" aspect of the anime doesn't actually begin until the very end of episode 2 going into episode 3. Furthermore, the progression (i.e. the deductive and inductive analysis) is very slow and does not build up to \"edge-of-your-seat\" climatic moments. Quite simply, you won't find a clever detective snooping around with a magnifying glass and quirky methodologies to solve the mystery. What you get, instead, is Sohei Saikawa and a lot of philosophical dialogue; and this is the main point that I wanted to get to.\\n\\n\r\nPerfect Insider is more of a kind of documentary than anything else. It \"documents\" the character's and their personalities to make a commentary on the human condition. The mystery aspect is, quite honestly, a side-note that adds a little bit of spunk to the overall narrative. However, it is still completely necessary as the mystery genre, in general, offers some of the best opportunities for internal reflection and inquiry. The exception in Perfect Insider is that, instead of asking solely HOW the killer committed the crime, a good portion of time is spend also asking WHY the killer committed the crime; and this all ties in with the philosophical dialogues that are persistent throughout the anime. \\n\\n\r\nSo, what type of viewer would enjoy this show? An intellectual. And by intellectual, I do not mean someone who is \"smart\" or \"intelligent.\" I mean someone who likes to inquire about nature and ponder the meaning that their life holds. There is a particular quote by Saikawa in episode 1 that stuck out to me, and it is something like this: Whenever I get up in the morning, I always think to myself, \"Am I really the same person I was yesterday\"? If you're someone that truly thinks about questions like these, then the meaning of Perfect Insider may make a lot more sense to you than the average person. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I can not say that Perfect Insider is perfect in itself. It could focus a bit more on the plot progression and character development, of which there exists none, in my opinion. I do not wish to get into a generic review discussing the music and animation, as both are of average to good quality, so there isn't really anything left to discuss. In addition, the score that I provide for this anime is not indicative of my overall impression; it is just something that is, of course, required.  One last thing that I do want to mention is that this anime is based off of a novel of a similar name, and, as a result, it holds a particular degree of \"unity.\"\\n\r\n In other words, the ending ties in and complements the beginning, and vice versa. So, remember this if you become confused by some of the scenes. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I think that Perfect Insider is a great anime with a good story and interesting character personalities. Please do not simply let the opinions of others, including myself, carry the significant weight in your overall decision-making. After all, we are all free to make our own choices as long as we first define \"ourselves.\"\\n",

Second, if you don't like mystery animes and you're an easily-bored person, don't watch this show; and if you watch, please do not write a review about how boring it is and give it 1/10. You're just misleading people.\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nYES, IT'S SLOW AND YES, IT'S BORING BUT JUST DEAL WITH IT. OK. So this story is about some genius people. First one, Magata Shiki. She is a very intelligent girl who killed her parents. Because of that she has to live in a room in an island. She stayed so many years. Thenhere comes our other geniuses, Saikawa sensei and Nishinosono moe. Some day Nishinosono decides to talk to Magata Shiki because she is curious, then Saikawa and Nishinosono end up that island because they want to talk to Magata face to face. Then the mystery begins... Magata Shiki goes out of that room after years, but in a wedding dress and dead and no arms and legs. They were like what the hell is going on here. Then an other crime happened and our 2 geniuses decide to solve that mystery. This was like a summary of the first 2 episodes. And I'm not going to tell what happens but I can say, it'll blow your mind.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art  is actually really good but some character's designs are really bad and it annoys me.

            "content": "The Perfect Insider is a mystery anime that came out in October 2015 and is an adaptation of a light novel by the same name, which was released in 1996. That should be enough to set expectations really low, and that is really the only way to enjoy this show. Either that or you only care about visuals, superficial characters and ignore plot holes.\r\n     So I'll start by saying what's good about this show. It was animated by A-1 Pictures, the same studio that adapted Sword Art Online, Shigatsu Wa Kimi No Uso and Fairy Tail(2009-2013), among others, into an anime. If you have watched any of the previously mentioned shows, you will know that A-1 Pictures makes some of the best lookin visuals and animation out there. The Perfect Insider is not an exception. The color palette used is bright and colorful, the backgrounds are beautiful, character figures move in a very fluid way, face expressions are detailed and there are no significant quality drops. Audio wise, the sound effects are pretty good, and the soundtrack, although forgettable, fits the show's ambience.\\n\\n\r\n     And so looking pretty is all that this show does well, and since every anime nowdays looks pretty, this isn't much to write home about. It does nothing to distinguish itself from every other mystery story out there.\\n\\n\r\n     And speaking of mystery, the whole purpose of having one in a story is to serve as a hook to keep people interested. It is a very good way to gradually reveal things about the world, plot or characters if they are not meant to be explained all at once. But it should never overshadow said world, plot or characters, and the Perfect Insider does exactly that. Everyone except the main characters are simply there to make the plot move forward. They get no characterization, no development, and feel very one dimensional. Some are not even given a name!\\n\\n\r\n     The main characters are not much better too. One of the protagonists is the typical \"genius that hates the world he lives in\" edgelord stereotype, randomly spewing out filosophical thoughts that sometimes don't even have anything to do with the story at all, in a poor attempt at making the show look \"deep\" and \"a commentary on the human condition\". The only thing that defines him is his love for cigarettes. The other protagonist is a girl that is in love with edgelord 420 (for no apparent reason), and is just as boring and bland as him.\\n\\n\r\n     The main villain is easily the most interesting character in the whole show, because unlike others she has motives and objectives, and is given a backstory and reasons to act like she does. Still, she is above average at best, since she also suffers from many of the same problems the other two main characters do.\\n\\n\r\n     Back to the mystery aspect, for a mystery to be done well, it needs to foreshadow future evens by giving hints and clues. The idea is that the viewer should have enough information to predict said future events. For example, in Death Note, the author makes sure to let us know everything we need to know to make the mind games feel plausible. Things like Light getting out of a difficult situation because he knew one crucial detail that was never hinted at before about the rules of the death note doesn't happen. The Perfect Insider does the exact opposite. To exemplify, there is a scene where the protagonist looks at a bookshelf (never shown before, by the way) and notices an important detail, a pattern in the books' volume numbers. There was no way anyone could have seen that coming, since this was never hinted at, thus making it a half-assed, poorly written way to make the story continue to unfold.\\n\\n\r\n     The mystery finally comes to an end when the main character has an epiphany and suddenly figures everything out, out of nowhere. Again, impossible for anyone to have thought of what he did.\\n\\n\r\n     To sum up, forgettable cardboard characters, plot that barely makes sense, slow pacing, pretentious and sometimes unnecessary filosophical reflections, poorly executed mystery, but beautiful visuals, very good animation and decent sound. The Perfect Insider is boring, forgettable, and badly written.",

            "content": "(No spoilers)\r\nThis anime is not for everyone, firstly you have to enjoy a more classic slow-paced mystery detective plot but mostly you have to enjoy \"clever\" conversations which might throw a lot of people off especially because it sometimes seems that the anime is trying to be too intelligent.\r\nFor me I watched the series to the end because of the relationship and interactions between the two main characters, I must say that the mystery part was until the last episodes a bit boring or just average but it was very enjoyable because of those two main characters.\r\nAll the rainbow faeces of the Unicorn - thegood things\\n\r\n- The art style for the 3 main characters was different and serious/realistic for the tone of the anime.\\n\r\n- The opening was quite entertaining and artistic :)\\n\r\n- The plot was average but the interaction between the 2-3 main characters made this anime great. I see this series as more of an romantic anime than mystery/thriller anime :3\\n\r\n- For me I liked the pace of the story, yes it is slow but only for developing the main characters, so I think that it was quite fitting.\\n\\n\r\nAll the hurtful.... cringe! - The cons \\n\r\n- The mystery was itself good but it could have been better and the anime could have paced a little bit quicker with the mystery plot.\\n\r\n- For me the soundtrack was just average, nothing to complain nor embrace.\\n\r\n- The conversations between the characters are very \"smart\"/philosophical which is understandable not for everyone\u00b4s taste and you really need to pay attention for all the small hints hidden in the conversations. \\n\\n\r\nSo yeah if you want to see a really good mystery detective series then this anime might not be for you, you really have to love the relationship and interaction between the two main characters because they are the factor which makes up the series. The mystery plot seems more like a catalyst for their relationship, the mystery plot isn\u00b4t the main focus I think ^^",

            "content": "*Some context:* I have been seriously watching anime for over 4 years now, and I have never found the need to actually write a review. This would be my first one, so I hope you guys bare with it. \r\nI'll explain my plight with a humorous short story - trust me, it's much more interesting that this anime:\r\n==\r\nIn an art competition, an artist stands in front of his painting, and the judges walk up to him and ask him to explain the concept before opening and revealing the painting on canvas. The artist says that he has drawn the situation where: \"Buddha lets fly awhite dove to symbolize peace and walks away. Unfortunately, a hunter who was hidden shoots this dove. The dove falls to the ground and dies.\" \\n\r\nThe judges were mesmerized with the concept and were yearning to see the painting. The artist reveals the canvas and it's absolutely white and plain. They ask him:\\n\r\nWhere is Buddha? - I told you that he let the dove fly and left!\\n\r\nWhere is the hunter? - I told you that he was hidden!\\n\r\nWhere is the dove? - I told you that it fell to the ground and died!\\n\r\nI think this anime is much like that. There is quite frankly a stupid hype around an absolutely plain and bland anime. If you are capable of just looking at a white canvas and imagining a concept as deep as above, maybe you'll enjoy this one. For mere mortals like myself, this anime is mediocre at best, and absolute shit if you are in a bad mood.\\n\r\n==\\n\\n\r\n=== My thoughts (mild spoilers) ====\\n\\n\r\n-- I think the Perfect Insider is at best a mediocre series, and your disappointment with it will likely increase the more you think about it. \\n\\n\r\n-- I feel that the author got hold of one idea: a person is locked in a room for 15 years with minimal observation inside the cell; this person must have a child inside which no one knows about; and a glorious plan is set into motion which lasts the entire 15 years.\\n\\n\r\n-- In order to make this implausible and frankly ridiculous idea a reality, the creators perform one ass-pull after the other. In order to disguise these ass-pulls, they pepper it up with copious amount of philosophical rants, which after a point becomes absolutely silly.\\n\\n\r\n-- There are some scenes, dialogues, and actions which wanted to portray a high-brow attitude and show that some of these characters are really smart. These absolutely bombed. I am working towards a PhD in Math/CS at a top university, and I haven't come across a single professor or student who acts this way. Some of the CS ideas are plain wrong too.\\n\\n\r\n-- Character motivations are not explained at all. Things happen a particular way because the author wanted it to happen that way. The events don't seem to evolve organically and feel almost forced. There are no reasons given for *why* a character does something other than the fact that doing so furthers a plot. There appear to be numerous alternative actions some characters could have done (including Dr. Shiki) which would have been quicker, neater, and led to the same final conclusion. People claimed to be as smart as these characters would certainly see such alternatives.\\n",

            "content": "TL;DR: Everything Becomes F: The Perfect Insider has what you might call the Prometheus problem. It looks good, seems interesting & at first you're totally along for the ride. Then, at some point, you start noticing that nothing makes sense & the more information it gives you, more questions you have.\r\nFall 2015 started out looking like such a strong season for detective dramas. Alongside the Return of Kindaichi Case Files, there were two new titles that looked set to fill a void for non-fantasy murder mysteries, with Beautiful Bones: Sakurako's Investigation & Everything Becomes F: The Perfect Insider (EBF) adding some new blood into agenre that has relatively slim pickings for anim\u00e9 fans. \\n\\n\r\n1. Story\\n\\n\r\nAt first, EBF seemed likely to be the best of all three. While Kindaichi began with what was the weakest case file of the series thus far, & Beautiful Bones seemed more interested in being Pet Pathologist of Sakurako than solving crimes, EBF's first few episodes provided a slow build up to its murder mystery, with a noticeably different art style, much darker tone & a more complex & intriguing story with a greater focus on the thoughts & philosophies of the main characters than in the other shows. While certainly slow, these early episodes laid a pretty solid looking foundation for a darker, smarter story than one can usually expect from TV anim\u00e9\\n\\n\r\nEBF's story unfolds through three plot lines that take place at different times & from the perspective of different characters. In the main story, Moe Nishinosono & her teacher/guardian/crush Souhei Saikawa all but blag their way into an island facility that houses Shiki Magata, the infamous as she is mysterious woman who murdered her parents fifteen years ago & has since lived in total isolation underground. No sooner do they manage this, then they find themselves caught up in a gruesome & seemingly impossible double murder. Concurrent to this, there are flashbacks to a previous interview between Moe & Shiki, in which Shiki takes a strange interest in Moe's past; & each episode also ends with another flashback, apparently from the perspective of Shiki's uncle writing his memories of a very dark & twisted relationship between Shiki & himself. \\n\\n\r\nFor the first few episodes of EBF, its slow pacing teeters on but doesn't completely cross the line between methodical & boring. EBF is a very dialogue driven series, & a large portion of the runtime is taken up by two characters talking about the mystery, which is even more impenetrable to them than the audience because they lack the benefit of those flashbacks giving context to Shiki's past & thus why she might have ended up how she did. While quite dry & dense, not to mention some laughably clunky lines like \"red...red is a colour\" the plot slowly builds momentum towards solving the cryptic riddle, apparently left by the killer, of what everything becomes F means, & thus the who, how & why of this seemingly impossible closed room murder mystery (incidentally, what's with anim\u00e9 & having characters use that literary term to refer to cases? Is it meant to be meta?)\\n\\n\r\nHowever, for all the potential of EBF, it ultimately falls apart once the characters & setting have been established. The deliberately slow pacing of the show increasingly seems less about methodically building up to a resolution than it is padding out an overly long runtime. The conversations between Moe & Souhei, which can be hard enough to sit through to begin with, start repeating themselves as they pretty much have nothing to do between episode six, when they first solve the meaning of F, & episode 10 when the plot finally decides it's time to close the case. Indeed, in what I can only assume was a rather glaring error that slipped through the script drafting process, they forget that they've solved the meaning of F (one meaning, anyway) so they can have another overly long exchange on what it might mean. This dialogue problem reaches it's most excruciating during an exchange between Souhei & a woman who's supposedly Shiki's sister which lasts ten minutes, is entirely in English & the VA's are clearly exerting all their effort into just getting the words right.\\n\\n\r\n2. Characters\\n\\n\r\nIt doesn't help that EBF's characters are, frankly, not able to carry such a slow story. Moe, can seem at times like she stumbled out of a high school anim\u00e9. Her character is meant to act as the emotional counterbalance to Souhei's cold rationalism, even though she is a maths genius which would suggest a character more suited to cool logic. Unfortunately, she mostly expresses this side of her by being petulant & sulky, especially when Souhei doesn't notice her. She seems to get jealous whenever other women talk to or even about him, & quickly seems to start measuring herself against Shiki when she sees the interest Souhei has in trying to figure out her strange ways. The plot has an habit of taking a break from solving the mystery to focus on Moe & Souhei's relationship, which is annoying at best - not least because the author has all but said he added a slow burning relationship between the two just to keep people reading his books (of which EBF is the first of nine volumes & various short stories).\\n\\n\r\nSouhei himself is the aloof, introverted type who speaks in monologues even when talking to other people.  VA Yasuyuki Kase also gives to Souhei a low, monotone voice that is suitable to the character, but means that a large portion of every episode is listening to his monotonous monologues. That Souhei is a self-important, get on my level type of character just makes it worse to listen to. \\n\\n\r\nHis interest in the mystery seems purely intellectual. Indeed, it's arguably a flaw of the show that there is actually no reason for Souhei & Moe to be there or be allowed to investigate. They first go to the facility because Moe claims to have an interview with Shiki, but that's soon revealed to be a lie, merely a devise to get them on the island (not the last time the story will rely on such a convenient contrivance to keep moving). Once the corpses appear, it's like they're solving the case just out of intellectual curiosity, which is fine & all but it doesn't explain why the staff are so cooperative, nor does it make for a compelling murder mystery in which he seems increasingly less interested in solving the mystery than in waxing lyrically about the philosophy that's apparently behind Shiki's & his own character.\\n\\n\r\nShiki is a difficult character to talk about in a spoiler free manner, given that everything in EBF revolves around her. She has a detached, otherworldly manner to her that is not entirely unlike the aloofness of Souhei, but whereas he generally comes across as a bit self-loathing because he too normal for his liking, Shiki does operate in a completely different way to \u201cregular\u201d people. From the way she interacts with people in the flashbacks to the clues found by Moe & Souhei during their investigation, she comes across not unlike Hannibal Lecter, someone as fascinating as they are impenetrable.\\n\\n\r\nThat impenetrableness, however, is also one of her flaws. Shiki is a character you want to understand, to decipher, but it's not possible to do so because, while I won't go into specifics, the reason for her being the enigma she is is ultimately that she was just born that way. That might not be an issue for some viewers, but for me personally saying a character was just born that way is like ending a story with it was all just a dream; even if the author intended it to be that way, it still feels like a cop out. This might be more of a problem in EBF's case because whereas Lecter's character is there to serve as a window into the mind of a different serial killer, Shiki is front & centre the focus of the story. \\n\\n\r\nQuite what her world view is also comes across in a rather jumbled manner. Themes of antinatalism, the nature of self & existentialism, nihilism & any other school of philosophy you fancy bringing up can be found somewhere, & it's clear some viewers have got a lot out of identifying & reading up on these. But be that as it may, Shiki herself is a character that makes less sense the more you're told about her, as do her motivations & actions. Souhei towards the end seems to view her as some sort of perfect human, but why that is seems to boil down to that she seems as complex as he wishes he was.\\n\\n\r\nIf this seems like too much focus to be putting on the main characters, it's simply because there is almost nothing worth saying about any of the support. The university students that accompany Souhei & Moe are really only there so Moe can talk to someone other than Souhei about the case in one episode. Likewise the staff at the facility just seem to wait around to be interviewed or push the plot button on a relevant keyboard. Shiki's uncle, who is nominally one of the characters whose point of view we're supposed to be viewing part of the story from, is completely eclipsed by his nieces presence & doesn't really have anything to him worth mentioning. Indeed, if EBF had just been Moe, Souhei & Shiki in a room together, it wouldn't have changed much.\\n\\n\r\n3. Production\\n\\n\r\nOn the production side of things, there are some rather odd directorial decisions that have been made during EBF. A couple of scenes, most notably the final one, seem to cut off abruptly & awkwardly. One scene where Souhei is talking to an employee of the facility has what looks like a rather amusing continuity error, where Souhei is meant to be cooking breakfast but whenever it cuts from showing the food to him talking, he's standing in the office with his hand apparently holding an invisible pan. Perhaps finally realising that watching two people sitting down, talking in shot, reverse-shot is rather boring, towards the end there are a couple of dialogue scenes where the location repeatedly changes during unbroken conversation; which is disorientating as much as it is attention keeping.\\n\\n\r\nThat's not to say EBF looks bad, by any means. Indeed it is a visually enjoyable experience, which is fortunate given how little movement or action occurs. The colour is sufficiently desaturated to suit the tone of the story, & the character designs are likewise realistic enough to not feel out of place as more stylised face designs would have. But, if I'm being honest, this is like complimenting a grey blur for picking the right shade of grey. The OP & ED are both enjoyable, with the OP being a rather fun to interpret dance routine between stencil outlines of Souhei, Moe & Shiki. So that's three minutes of this nearly four hour show worth watching, at least. There is a rather contrived reason to get Moe into a two piece swimsuit in one episode, but other than that the director resists the temptation to add the usual anime visual clich\u00e9s. \\n\\n\r\nThis review has been harsher on EBF than it perhaps was intended to be, but then again it's the type of show that the more I think about it, the less it holds up. That the main characters are rather flawed could have made them interesting, but they're so boring & full of themselves that it it doesn't take long to be sick of seeing them. You only have to look at the Sodachi arc of Owarimonogatari, which aired at the same time, to see how a dialogue driven dark mystery anime can be done better. \\n\\n\r\nThere are some clever sounding twists that initially make you think \"oooh that's interesting\" till you pause to think about how they just complicate & confuse an already difficult to comprehend story. In fact clever sounding twists that complicate everything pretty much sums up EBF, especially with regards to Shiki. It's a real shame that it is this way, because buried in there, somewhere, was a murder mystery I really wanted to like. Indeed, if I were to rewatch the series again, knowing what depths it sinks to, I'd probably have an even more negative opinion of it.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe it's because they're only adapting the first in a series of novels, which means nothing is really concluded & indeed gives the whole series the sense of just being the first act or prologue to a bigger story. Indeed, in a perfect world I'd like to imagine they would have adapted the entire series, making each one a feature length episode in the way ITV did their best detective dramas in the 90s & early 2000's. But whatever EBF could have been, it's hard to recommend what it is.",

I normally don't watch a lot of mystery or thriller anime, but so far I've enjoyed The Perfect Insider more than I honestly thought I would. Obviously, the animation and character designs are nothing impressive, which is why I scored it so low in the art department, and Shikawa is really the only character I've found interesting and solid in his development; however, the opening and ending theme songs are great, and the soundtrack for the overall show has some pretty good, fitting tracks as well.\r\nOthers have said the show moves fairly slow,and in my opinion they're right. This doesn't detract from the show's pacing though; for The Perfect Insider, it works well, and I like how you're provided with information - both in the present and from the past - at varying intervals. Everything slowly falls into place, and it's certainly not chronological but I think it's more enjoyable to learn different things that are all over the place, and piece them together yourself as you follow the show and the character's own thoughts and insights. It's definitely a show you have to stick with; noticeably, those who gave the show lower ratings didn't watch that much of it, but if you're willing to endure slow pacing and average side characters that are somewhat lacking in the personality department, then you're honestly in for a treat plot-wise; Subeta ga F ni Naru: The Perfect Insider is a hidden gem of twists, revelations and a seemingly impossible mystery.",

The story soon transformed from a murder mystery to a math/computer geek's wet dream come true.

            "content": "The Perfect Insider is hard to review objectively because it is one of those shows that people will defend as being \"deep\" and \"nuanced\". I'm not going to argue against that, maybe there is some deeper truth that I missed, but I didn't enjoy it and my review will reflect that.\r\nFirst of all, the good: This show is visually appealing, especially the opening theme animation. I also found the animation pretty solid throughout and the sound never really distracted me from the story. \r\nThe problems I've had with the show was the story. The show does a good job of setting up the sense thatthere's going to be a grand denouement where the truth is found out and the guilty part is pointed out, or that everything will come to be clear.  \\n\\n\r\nTo a certain extend this is accomplished. You know who did what at the end, but it felt unsatisfactory, probably because there was so much going on that I just started getting lost halfway through the story. There's a romance, child sexual abuse by a relative (though maybe not in the strictest legal sense in Japan, certainly for America/most countries since age of concent is different), a murder, a ghost in a computer, a doll that killed someone else years ago then ran away, multiple personalities, two sets of dead parents unrequited love, sisters showing up out of the blue and then going away only to reappear at a later time after which you find something you didn't know.\\n\\n\r\nThe show suffered from the fact that too much was going on and you didn't get to see the character's motivations. You're also severely limited in the facts you are given and it's hardly fair to the viewer who wants to try and solve the murder along with the main character. Something that most mysteries do is to give you clues or hints along the way that you can reflect on later on and go \"Oooh, I should have SEEN that!\" and kick yourself. Sure they don't share the conclusions drawn by the detective, but you had at least some of the major building blocks and were there when the scene was set and you could figure it out.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't feel that in this show, though I might have missed it because I was too busy feeling too squeamish throughout most of the show to notice, but I felt like they kept more than the fair share of facts, important facts away from us, just to keep the suspense going. Characters who I feel should know more about things mysteriously don't because that would be inconvenient to the plot. \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that annoyed me was how they kept giving some philosophy lectures. \"What is the meaning to be human? What is murder? What is a person? What is love?\" To an extent this did help flavour the show, but it was just one more thing that was distracting from the main focus. I also didn't like a lot of the answers they came up with, which might explain my distaste for this show. \\n\\n\r\nThe relationships and connections were rather vague until nearing the end because that would have possibly tipped us off to what was going on. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I would say skip this anime unless you really like the mystery genre and philosophy. I felt awkward watching the scenes concerning underage sexual activity with a grown relative, the more \"traditional\" romances were weak and I didn't feel they did fair play with the mystery. The reasons why the main character decides to solve the mystery also are somewhat opaque as well.",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nHave you ever thought about the concept of nothing?\r\nNothing means no books, no chairs, no phones. It means no mirrors, no cards, no pillows. Even when all of these physical objects are gone, there is still more to remove. No air, no light, no electromagnetic forces, no atoms, no thoughts.\r\nNo anything.\r\nSubete ga F ni Naru: The Perfect Insider goes the opposite way. \u201cEverything\u201d is just as crazy as \u201cnothing.\u201d Now those books and those pillows and those atoms are around, but that is not enough. Even when you think you collected it all, there isstill more to collect. And then some.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cEverything\u201d means everything to The Perfect Insider. But while it did not collect everything, it still provides a pretty strong anime.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nThe Perfect Insider would, from the outside, appear to be a mystery anime. And this description is true. An unexplainable set of events occur, the characters all work together to find an explanation, and a satisfactory solution is singled out. Over the course of eleven episodes, the anime does just this.\\n\\n\r\nBut from the inside, the anime is that second genre: psychological.\\n\\n\r\nTo be more precise, the anime is philosophical. The mystery acts as a buffer for the philosophical ideas that The Perfect Insider toys with. Questioning \u201cWho are you?\u201d is a common line of thinking for the anime. Discussing the nature of the body versus the soul is where the anime feels safest. Trying to define the concept of freedom or love makes the anime content.\\n\\n\r\nTying each of these ideas together is another idea, one that is the most important to the anime and is another difficult philosophical concept.\\n\\n\r\nDeath.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a surprising amount of death in the show. The death of Dr. Magata\u2019s daughter. The death of her parents. The death of her twin brother and maid. The death of Director Shindou. The death of Nishinosono\u2019s parents. Death surrounds the anime.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of words are said by the The Perfect Insider about death. But, succinctly, the anime comes to its conclusion through Dr. Magata: Death is a cure.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem is in the presentation. The anime barfs all of this information in the audience\u2019s lap within the last two episodes. The other ideas are posited, creating a foundation for the idea of death, but deeper exploration of death happens almost too late. It unfortunately has to be this way: The rest of the season has to focus on the mystery and the positing. Hence, the anime\u2019s philosophical take on death, while wildly interesting, fails to reach the audience in an easily digestible manner.\\n\\n\r\nYet, is that not the point? The philosophical questions are hard to understand because they are, well, hard to understand. Dr. Magata is an anomaly. She thinks in a way that nobody else has ever done before. And, in a way, the audience is not supposed to understand what she is thinking. Because, as Saikawa-sensei aptly and contextually puts it, we are \u201cprogrammed\u201d to think differently from this insane, unique genius.\\n\\n\r\nBut this barf is hard to swallow. Life is a beautiful opportunity. Life gives people fun and places to visit and different hobbies and relationships and information to learn and food worth trekking those extra few minutes to get and anime to watch and happiness. That is, life is (and relevantly) everything.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cA flower wilts for the sake of a new seed\u201d is the anime justifying a child killing its mother. \u201cIsn\u2019t the instinctive desire of beings, born not of their own volition, for their lives to be taken in the same way?\u201d is the anime trying to make the murdering of others appear normal.\\n\\n\r\nThese notions are not justifiable. These notions are not normal. They are ridiculous. They are ridiculous because death is not the answer. Death removes life. And since life is everything, death removes everything. Providing \u2013 by equivalency \u2013 nothing.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond the philosophical themes lays the narrative itself which is comprised of two timelines.\\n\\n\r\nThe first is the present. Here, Nishinosono and Saikawa-sensei work together with the staff of the island laboratory to solve the mystery surrounding them. The second is the past. Here, Director Shindou and Dr. Magata \u2013 as a young teenager \u2013 slowly reveal what happened all those years ago. The past timeline usually appears at the end of most episodes since nearly every scene from the past is filled with suspense and important information. I.e., a cliffhanger.\\n\\n\r\nThis past-and-present technique is simple and common but effective. Having the narrative split, flip-flopping between the present and the past, ramps up the mystery. It helps to make the proceedings more confusing, more unknown to the audience.\\n\\n\r\nYet the anime more or less confuses itself when it commits a big crime of its own: It rarely shows what happened \u201cbehind the scenes.\u201d For example, Dr. Magata and her child are only shown together at the end. Before the end, the audience gets nothing. The audience is not given a view of them in their secluded \u201chome\u201d or an idea of their daily lives or what the child thought of her mother and vice versa.\\n\\n\r\nAnother example is Dr. Magata and Director Shindou. While they have more scenes together than the mother and daughter \u2013 like riding a Ferris wheel or at a hotel \u2013 there are still not enough interactions shown to make their relationship appear worthwhile.\\n\\n\r\nNot having these and the other set of interactions arguably ramps up the mystery further. Which is a nice argument. But it also prevents the audience from fully understanding Dr. Magata and, by extension, the philosophical reasoning she oft leans on.\\n\\n\r\nThe Perfect Insider\u2019s narrative also leans but on a plot contrivance. Later on in the season, a futuristic pod device is introduced. A big problem is that the pod was never mentioned. But even more problematic is what it is used for.\\n\\n\r\nFirst, the pod reveals to Nishinosono a hugely important set of details from her past. And second, the pod gives Nishinosono and Saikawa-sensei the opportunity to speak with Dr. Magata. Because the pod is so restricted in its use, it comes off as too niche. As such, events that should be worthwhile to the narrative come off as overly convenient.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the mystery itself, the anime does well. The details that make up the mystery are rather clever. A pregnancy, hexadecimal code, and imitation of a nonexistent sister keep the audience guessing for the duration of the anime. While it may have been best to actually show Dr. Magata going through some of these actions \u2013 the murder of her daughter, her creating the Trojan code \u2013 what is most important is keeping its events a mystery which The Perfect Insider did.\\n\\n\r\nThe Perfect Insider does come full-circle with its narrative when it references the magic trick and the t-shirts, but there are too many problems beforehand that weigh the anime down.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nActual animation in The Perfect Insider remains relatively average. However, certain actions, like a character speaking or hair billowing or Saikawa-sensei failing to put in his eye drops, prove the anime can heighten its actual animation when it wants to.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless of what level of animation is going on, the anime places extra care in its art, presenting visuals that are almost always meaningful. For example, the art does not just have the characters moving around. The art actively characterizes the cast.\\n\\n\r\nIn one episode. Nishinosono calls her butler back home. When he takes too long in his reply, she gets impatient. The audience sees her impatience plastered on her face and, more strikingly, in the fidgeting of the mouse pointer on the computer screen.\\n\\n\r\nIn the same episode, Saikawa-sensei is smoking a cigarette. (As he always does.) He speaks half of his sentence, inhales some smoke, and then exhales it. As if the smoke cleared his mind, he readjusts what he says.\\n\\n\r\nIn a different episode, Dr. Magata sits in her chair, looking like a doll. It is not until Director Shindou arrives that her face lights up and she begins to animate.\\n\\n\r\nTiny details like these say so much about the characters without resorting to exposition. And the anime uses such subtleties a lot.\\n\\n\r\nTo reiterate, The Perfect Insider contains a lot of expository material in the form of narration and monologues. Furthermore, the anime takes place on one island and (for the most part) within one building. As such, the anime puts as much care into its artistic direction as it does its art. But, rather than adding character depth, these details are designed to engage the audience.\\n\\n\r\nA wonderful example is in the fourth episode. Director Shindou starts with a small bit of narration: \u201cI heard her voice. Or more precisely, their\u2026.\u201d The anime then proceeds to have Dr. Magata, currently a young teenager, speak to herself with her multiple personalities. But rather than just showing her talking to herself, the anime constantly shifts the perspective.\\n\\n\r\nOne perspective positions itself behind Director Shindou. One aims at her from her right side. One faces the mirror in front of her. One sits outside the barely ajar door. The scene does not last long, and the technique is subtle, but the different perspectives mirror the different personalities of Dr. Magata, making it hard to know \u201cwho\u201d is really speaking.\\n\\n\r\nSometimes, these visuals derive from one\u2019s imagination. The purple water in Nishinosono\u2019s nightmare subconsciously reminds her of her purple dress. The cold, enclosed interrogation room for Nishinosono and the warm, open patio for Saikawa-sensei indicate the feelings between these two and Dr. Magata. Dr. Magata and her daughter riding on the back of a camel in the desert evokes a sense of endless discovery for that \u201cperfect answer\u201d the doctor says does not exist.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening track and ending track likewise mire themselves in imagination. The traced dance number in the opening track symbolizes the \u201cdance\u201d the characters have with each other. And the inner guts of some software forming an image of the doctor in the ending track symbolizes the \u201csoftware\u201d that makes up who people are.\\n\\n\r\n(A special shout-out goes to Nishinosono\u2019s small jig in the middle of the opening track. Her body bobbing and head bobbing are strangely alluring.)\\n\\n\r\nMore often than not, however, the visuals ground themselves in reality. Said realism comes from not just the lighting and the setting but also the character designs. People in The Perfect Insider wear regular clothes, varying in eye, nose, and mouth shapes to get at diversity without resorting to crazy.\\n\\n\r\nThe main cast \u2013 Nishinosono, Saikawa-sensei, and Dr. Magata \u2013 are the same, but, as the mains, they have a few extra details. Nishinosono\u2019s short hair and baby face visually paint her as a na\u00efve child. Saikawa-sensei\u2019s many t-shirts signify his \u201cmany eyes\u201d as Dr. Magata puts it. As for Dr. Magata, her white gown represents her \u201cpure\u201d disposition.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the The Perfect Insider leverages its art as much as possible to present a wonderful-looking anime.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nThe Perfect Insider approaches its characters in a strange way.\\n\\n\r\nThe audience learns a bit about Nishinosono, Saikawa-sensei, and Dr. Magata throughout the season. Nishinosono can manipulate large numbers, has a deep affection for Saikawa-sensei, and lost her parents at too young of an age. Saikawa-sensei deals with life in a calm, logical manner, smoking cigarettes and making silly jokes to pass the time. And Dr. Magata slept with her uncle, killed her parents, and hid herself away for fifteen years before reemerging to seek death.\\n\\n\r\nWeirdly, the individual characters do not matter. They neither develop within the narrative nor impact it. What is truly important is the faux love triangle that exists between the three main players: Nishinosono, Saikawa-sensei, and Dr. Magata.\\n\\n\r\nThe whole dynamic is, perhaps obviously, complicated. But the best way to describe it is in terms of getting and understanding. \u201cGetting\u201d means seeing what another is saying. \u201cUnderstanding\u201d means seeing and comprehending what another is saying. That is, one cannot understand another without first getting them, but one can get another without understanding them. (Confused yet?)\\n\\n\r\nAn example. Nishinosono gets Saikawa-sensei. She knows when he is lying. She gets his sense of humor. She tends to know what he thinks. But her love for him, a love she feels is not reciprocated but instead aimed at Dr. Magata, prevents her from completely understanding him. Part of her character arc involves moving closer to the understanding side: learning just how much Saikawa-sensei helped her in the past lets her understand him differently.\\n\\n\r\nYet she cannot get Dr. Magata. She questions the doctor, and she is flabbergasted at how the doctor finds killing her own parents \u2013 when Nishinosono tragically lost her own \u2013 a simple, justifiable move.\\n\\n\r\nSaikawa-sensei completely understands Nishinosono. He knows how to make her laugh. He had been there for her during the lowest point in her life. He accepts her \u201ccontradictions\u201d as he puts it. But, with Dr. Magata, he only gets her. He does not understand her. He admires her for who she is. He gets what she says, but he cannot fully understand her mindset.\\n\\n\r\nDr. Magata, as the flawless character she happens to be, completely understands both Nishinosono and Saikawa-sensei. She understands Nishinosono because of her apathy towards humans, her thinking similar thoughts (as episode two showcases), and her not having parents either. And since Saikawa-sensei has a \u201cvery similar structure,\u201d she understands how he operates, too.\\n\\n\r\nIn summary, Nishinosono gets Saikawa-sensei but does not get Dr. Magata. Saikawa-sensei understands Nishinosono but only gets Dr. Magata. Dr. Magata understands both Nishinosono and Saikawa-sensei. (Still following?)\\n\\n\r\nThe dynamics are complicated. But why? Why create such a convoluted set of dynamics? Why focus so much on their interpersonal connections rather than their intrapersonal selves?\\n\\n\r\nThe Perfect Insider\u2019s narrative bases itself on the answer to this question. The anime is, after all, a mystery. However, the answer finally manifests within the last ten minutes or so of the season.\\n\\n\r\nTwo separate scenes in these last ten minutes are shown. In the real world, Saikawa-sensei recounts a story about Nishinosono\u2019s father. In the imaginary world, Dr. Magata talks with her daughter about humanity. Both conversations revolve around the same theme: questioning and answering.\\n\\n\r\nPeople are constantly questioning. Questioning the world is what drives people forward. And, by extension, people are constantly trying to find answers to these questions. Nishinosono questioned \u201cWhy do people live?\u201d Saikawa-sensei\u2019s answers got her laughing again. Dr. Magata\u2019s daughter questioned herself, so she sought \u201cfreedom.\u201d Dr. Magata questioned Saikawa-sensei in the ocean, and, after hearing his creative response \u2013 \u201cBecause you can\u2019t smoke underwater.\u201d \u2013 she wanted to meet him once more.\\n\\n\r\nDr. Magata phrases it best: \u201cIf they [humans] knew everything, they would attempt nothing. If they attempted nothing, nothing new would happen. Humans seek answers to the things they do not know. That is how kindness, nostalgia, joy, and fun are born.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nIn other words, questioning the world and finding those answers allows people to get, allows people to understand. To get and understand the world, thoughts, and, most importantly, people.\\n\\n\r\nThis directive is The Perfect Insider\u2019s main message. Question others, question ourselves. Only then can answers be found. A \u201cperfect answer,\u201d as Dr. Magata says, may never, ever be discovered. But so long as people question, answers will follow.\\n\\n\r\nIn other words, to understand each other, people simply have to ask, \u201cWho are you?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nAlongside the art, the sound-work of The Perfect Insider is one of its strongest aspects.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening track comes out on top. Its upbeat vibe completely contrasts with the mysterious vibe of the anime, making the track feel even more fun. The vocalist does a wonderful job, too, with the step-wise, quick, and \u201cYea!\u201d lyrics. And, as is pretty much required for a dance song, the track is quite catchy. Made so by the drums, the guitar, and the not-too-fast-and-not-too-slow-but-just-right speed. The OP is a fantastic track that is more than worth listening to both inside and outside of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending track is a step down, but that is not saying all that much. The dual female and male vocalists working together symbolizes Nishinosono and Saikawa-sensei doing the same. The different techno sound-effects fit the computerized motif. The toned-down build-up in the middle. That held lyric. The sudden and not-long-lasting loss of music near the end. All of these details, combined with the catchiness, make the ED into yet another strong track offered by the anime.\\n\\n\r\nNot wanting to be outdone, the rest of the original soundtrack does well too. Tension-filled tracks made up of fast violins and harps. Soft, piano-and-flute tracks for those extremely pleasant moments. And melancholic tracks composed of violins and chimes. These more classical tracks, alongside the more mysterious ones, set up and fit the atmosphere of the anime quite well, making the OST another strong addition to the anime.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting performances are similarly high in execution. Yasuyuki Kase as Saikawa-sensei uses an older, reserved voice that suits the cigarette-loving teacher and that does not get annoying to hear for long periods of time. Atsumi Tanezaki as Nishinosono uses a cute voice that is both mature and young, reflecting the girl\u2019s same disposition. And Ibuki Kido as Dr. Magata has a calm, plain way of speaking. Her voice captures the doctor\u2019s levelheadedness which accentuates her rare, more emotional outbursts.\\n\\n\r\nThe Perfect Insider also deserves huge props for a scene that somewhat came out of nowhere. In episode seven, Saikawa-sensei talks to Dr. Magata\u2019s \u201csister.\u201d The cool part is they both do so in English. The coolest part is that the scene lasts a really long time. And when the audience thinks they are done, they keep going. Cleverly, it distracts the audience from thinking that the \u201csister\u201d is actually Dr. Magata, especially when she speaks in the third person.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nI liked this one. And I certainly appreciated what it did. It might be as opposite to a \u201cturn your brain off\u201d anime as an anime can get. The deep, philosophical questions were (obviously) the reason for this.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime forced me to spend a lot of time dissecting what it was trying to say. While that may be an indicator that the anime delivered its message unsuccessfully \u2013 me literally having to type out their conversations, verbatim, in order to have their exact thoughts close by seems a little absurd \u2013 it gave me the chance to question.\\n\\n\r\nI thought about my own ideals. I thought about the ideals of others. I thought about life and death and myself. Not many anime can make me do that.\\n\\n\r\nThe mystery itself was okay but nothing I was ever taken in by. Mostly because the stakes never felt high, and the payoff was lackluster. Dr. Magata was okay, too. I am not a big fan of perfect characters; I would have liked to have seen her challenged more. The whole point is that she was perfect, but her being so flawless made her less interesting than she could have been.\\n\\n\r\nI did like the \u201cromance\u201d between Nishinosono and Saikawa-sensei, though. Her storming out into the hallway and yelling to herself out of frustration when she learned about Saikawa-sensei staying over at another woman\u2019s (his sister, unbeknownst to Nishinosono) place made me chuckle. Or Nishinosono declaring that she, not Saikawa-sensei\u2019s sister, would be buying his shirts from now on made me laugh. And just the teasing, natural dialogue they shared with each other made me smile on more than a few occasions.\\n\\n\r\nNishinosono herself could be cute and fun, too. Kicking out the female lab worker because she was getting too buddy-buddy with Saikawa-sensei \u2013 \u201cDoor, close!\u201d \u2013 had me laughing since this small act was both funny and true to her personality. And her appearing grossed out by the fact that Saikawa-sensei wanted her to call him an \u201cidiot\u201d had me grinning. A lot of these moments overlapped with her relationship to Saikawa-sensei, but they were, nonetheless, entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nSubete ga F ni Naru: The Perfect Insider has some highs and some lows. More highs than lows. The art and the music are extremely strong, but the story and the characters, despite the philosophy, could have been executed better. In the end, the anime did neither everything nor nothing. But it did, at least, do something.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Bad, while the mystery itself is constructed well, a ridiculous take on death, the lack of important interactions, and an unfortunate plot contrivance each weigh the narrative down\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Great, subtleties, reality, and imaginary come together to create a visually impressive treat\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Fine, Nishinosono, Saikawa-sensei, and Dr. Magata are not strong characters on an individual basis, but their interpersonal relationships nicely explore the theme on questioning and answers\\n\\n\r\nSound: Great, fantastic OP, great ED, nice OST, above average VA performances\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good, the mystery and Dr. Magata were okay, Nishinosono and Saikawa-sensei, especially Nishinosono, were fun, and it forced self-reflection\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 7/10",

            "content": "The accusation of being 'pretentious' has been lobbed at Subete ga F ni Naru quite often. This is unfair, considering the author actually worked as a researcher for quite a while. The integration of maths and computer science elements into the story is basic (in concession to the audience) but does bring a unique flavour into what would otherwise be a standard locked room mystery. The story starts off slowly, setting up the characters and story with dry factual dialogue, but as events unfold, more elements are added to the mystery and the relationship between Moe and Souhei becomes more fleshed out, leading to somemore compelling drama in the second half. Magata Shiki's past also adds an edge and strangeness to the story that fans of psychological anime will appreciate.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the story is good, Subete ga F ni Naru's problem is that it follows the structure of the novel too closely, or at least it appears that way from someone who never read it. The setting and events are static, and with mature, realistic characters, even with the same script it feels this would be better realised in live action with good actors. The pacing is also a tad too slow; where 'show, don't tell' is an important principle in literature it is surely doubly important in television. The drab colour palette visually reinforces this impression, although by and large the audiovisual quality of this series is very good, with very expressive facial animation in important scenes.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a straight, compelling mystery told through the anime medium, Subete ga F ni Naru is the show for you. Just don't expect much more out of it than you could get from a book.",

            "content": "So I first decided to watch this show based off a recommendation from a Youtuber and I'm really glad I decided to give it a go. If you're looking for a true mystery anime this is the one to try. \r\nStory: (9/10) The story was one of the things that impressed me the most about this anime. It starts out with Nishinosono Moe and her professor Saikawa Souhei who are both fans of the work of Dr. Magata Shiki, a scientist who has been living in complete isolation on an island for 15 years. Not only is she all alone but she ultimately hasn't lefther room let alone the laboratory she's been living in. Moe and Souhei decide that they want to go to meet Dr. Shiki in person but when they arrive they encounter more than one murder. \\n\\n\r\nAt first when watching this show, I was actually pretty bored. You would think, \"Wow they walk into a murder scene, must be pretty intense!\" But the first few episodes are super talky, for lack of a better turn and I found myself fighting to keep my attention on it. I actually briefly considered dropping the show, but something told me I should stick it out, and boy am I glad I did. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the best things about this show is its pacing. Of the mystery anime I've seen, many of them take you on a wild goose chase of crazy outlandish mysteries that really don't even have anything to do with the main plot. Not Perfect Insider. Even though the show starts out slow the build up to the resolution of the mystery is handled excellently.  It reveals little pieces of information episode by episode and avoids the all too common flood of information squeezed into the last few episodes, which I absolutely loved. Other than the pacing the story itself is just darn good. Just when you think you know what's going on, it twists in ways that you weren't expecting. Once the ball gets rolling, Perfect Insider keeps the viewer on their toes and makes them think throughout the whole series. The only thing that keeps me from giving the story a 10/10 is the fact that it got a little confusing in parts and I wished for a little bit more explanation. But overall an excellent story.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10 The art and animation style in Perfect Insider was very unique! The character designs weren't you're typical kawaii, big eyed stereotypical anime characters. The people were designed more realistically than a lot that I've seen. The colors in this show were sometimes a bit bland but it fit the overall serious tone of the show, so I don't feel that it took away from anything.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10 I'm giving this a perfect 10 because I really liked the opening and ending songs, especially the opening. As far as the soundtrack, it really fit the serious and dark tone that was woven throughout the story. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10 The characters in Perfect Insider were fairly well developed. But I wished for a little more on the two lead characters that I just didn't get. I wanted to know more about what made them tick, how they got to where they were. That being said we do get a bit of background on them towards the end which is great. As far as how likable they are it's 50/50. I sometimes liked them and sometimes they got on my nerves. I guess it just depends on what they were doing at the time. The reason I gave this category an 8 instead of a bit lower though was because of one character and that was Dr. Magata Shiki. She is probably one of the most brilliant characters I've seen written. You go into this series knowing that she's a genius but genius doesn't even being to cover it. I can't say much more than that without giving away major plot points, but you'll have to take my word on it. She's a well thought out character and the reason the plot is so great. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment: 8/10 I've pretty much covered in the other sections why I enjoyed this anime. I love something that keeps me guessing what's going to happen next. Not only guess but actually care about the ending. As also previously stated, the only reason that this isn't ranked a little higher is because this show could be really confusing at times especially if you aren't paying super close attention. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10 Even though my individual category scores are higher, I still give Perfect Insider a 7. This is only simply because while every thing I said above is true, it's probably not a show that I would buy on DVD or watch again other than maybe to get some clarification. That being said, I believe that Perfect Insider is very impressive for its mystery genre which can sometimes fall flat. Definitely give this one a shot. \\n\\n\r\nI would just like to add as a disclaimer that I am in no way any sort of anime expert. I just like to add my opinion on shows I've watched :)",

Everything about it enchanted me from the very beginning; from the main character, Nishinosono, to the mystery lurking at the core of it all, to the eerie feel that the whole series has. You'll remain in awe of the characters' sheer mental brilliance from the beginning to the end, and you'll come to understand Nishinosono more than you understand yourself. The show makes it so very clear to its audience what the motivations of each character are, in its own time. If you're confused, just keep watching: everything will be revealed eventually, and what isn't is barely enough to tantalizeyou.\\n\\n\r\nIt is, I believe, a psychological horror, and if you like that genre, you can't go wrong with Subete ga F ni Naru. Beware of some blood, though.",

            "content": "It's hard to explain exactly why I gave this anime 3 stars without giving away spoilers, so this is going to be a pretty short review. The show starts quite promisingly. A professor and the orphaned daughter (who drives a GORGEOUS Alfa Romeo) of the former head of the university at which the aforementioned prof works travel to the lab of a legendary genius programmer, famous for having murdered her parents at age 15 and for having locked herself in a single room at the lab ever since. The murder mystery is introduced almost right away, in very dramatic fashion, and the protagonists spend therest of the show trying to solve it. The biggest problem with the show is that I, a person of very average intelligence, was able to figure out who was behind the murder, if not exactly how the murder played out, very shortly after it happened, while it took the supposed Mensa IQ professor and rich girl ten more episodes. Ten more episodes full of nothing but Mensa IQ chainsmoking prof spouting reams of pseudoprofound bullshit and rich girl getting violently jealous every time another girl dares to exist within a 10-mile radius of him, while you are bombarded with hints the size of the moon as to who was behind the murder. Rather than coming to a climax, the show fizzles out around the middle of the tenth episode as the protagonists come to conclusions the viewer never could have reached because there were no hints leading up to them, and Magata and edgelord prof finally reach their personal Nirvana, where they can spout pseudointellectual bullshit at each other to their hearts' content. The art is unmemorable, the characters even less so, and the story - it could have and should have been told in an hour, tops. No-one goes anywhere or does anything of note aside from, as I said above, filling the air with philosophical-sounding word salad. If you think vaguely edgy, perpetually bored middle-aged chainsmokers with all the intuition of a concrete block droning on and on about how they're too smart for this world is deep and profound, this is the show for you. If not, you would probably be better off watching something else.",

The build-up and plot twists were interesting enough, character development was sort of there for the main duo and the show had plenty of clues and smokescreens to help keep the viewer invested. But if you're looking for a conclusion, I'm sorry to say it's in another castle. The criminal is still at large, a clear motive is never given to tie it allup and at the end of it you feel it was less about the mystery and more about the crime solving pair's brief run-in with the enigma that is Magata Shiki and what effect this had on their relationship. Seriously. All of that just so the main protagonists could awkwardly take it to first base? Ok. Whatever.\\n\\n\r\nDecent build-up, poor conclusion.\\n\\n\r\n6/10",

            "content": "Subete no F ni Naru is so a mystery show that had a really weak start but had an interesting ending that was able to string together the elements presented throughout the mystery part.\r\nSo the first few episodes, alone, I would rate poorly. Most of it was just philophaster nonsense that was presented in an inappropriate way. It was also in no way philosophical. It was almost on the level of Jayden Smith's tweets. The first few episodes seem to try to show the relationship between Moe and Saikawa except the first episode already establishes their relationship and the following episodes do nothing to expandthat; all they do is continue with the philsophaster nonsense.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, around midway, this is when the show becomes interesting, as this is when the mystery really begins. The elements and clues presented throughout the episodes thenceforth were directly related to the story and you don't feel like something random that was not presented earlier, just shows up. Also, as a computer scientist, I love how they implemented hexadecimal into the story. This all relates back to \"Subete ga F Ni Naru\".\\n\\n\r\nSo how was it overall? I'd say it okay. You could probably watch the first episode, then skip the next few and you wouldn't miss a thing. This is definitely the better mystery this season than, say, Sakurako-san",

            "content": "The mystery genre is one of the most rewarding genres of any medium in my opinion. However, it is normally very hard to get it right, especially in anime. I can probably count on one hand, maybe two, the amount of generally well recieved mystery anime in the community. So, how does The Perfect Insider fare?\r\nThe first thing that struck me right off the bat was it's pacing. For an 11 episode show to only introduce the core mystery at the end of episode 2 indicates just how slow this show is. Surprisingly though, nothing really feels rushed even with only 8 or so episodesto complete the mystery. The mystery is exceptionally well-realized, and the slow pace adds to the atmosphere that the mystery and the characters build from the ground up.\\n\\n\r\nThe mystery itself is very effective. If you pay enough attention, you might just be able to figure out the mystery yourself. It's a mystery that is fairly logical, works well off the characters, and the answer isn't obvious.  It creates one of the best things a mystery anime can do, which is keep you guessing to try and figure out the mystery for yourself. It's not perfect, as there are a couple things left to plot convenience and the reliance of the incredibly smart main characters, but those moments are thankfully few and far between. \\n\\n\r\nAs for characters, the two leads work off each other very well. They have fairly unique character interactions with one another, good backstories, ideals, and the like. They were interesting leads to follow, and reacted to the core mystery in a way that makes sense while never breaking the tone of the show as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then we have Magata Shiki, undisputedly the best part of the show. Her take on human life alone makes her a worthwhile character. So many things, big and little alike, encompass this character to create a wholly 3-dimensional person. I'm not going to mention much more than that as she's a character better left experienced by the viewer rather than some random internet twat telling you about her. :)\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest flaw in the show also resides in the character section, and that is the side characters. None of them were really that interesting at all, but when the main characters have as much depth as they do, it doesn't really take away to have lackluster side characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is very well done as well. The character designs are top-tier, but the thing that really struck me the most was the amount of white that was used, both as light and in the colour palette. This again adds to the more surreal atmosphere this show emanates. Overall, a step up quality wise than what A-1 pictures normally puts out nowadays. The soundtrack has both a calming and eerie feel to it, which worked very effectively. I wasn't a big fan of the opening for a while, as it really doesn't fit in with the show at all. And while I stand by that statement, the song by itself is pretty damn catchy.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as mystery anime goes, The Perfect Insider is certainly one of the better ones. The core mystery engages the viewer with it's simplistic premise, and keeps them engaged with it's more complicated innerworkings. However, it's the unique yet intriguing main characters and their interpretations on the main themes of The Perfect Insider that really hit it home for me. And I mean come on, Saikawa fucking moonwalks in an episode, so it's worth the watch just for that. Certainly one of the better shows to come out of 2015, and I'd say if you don't mind the slow pace, give it a try.",

            "content": "Subete ga F ni Naru was recommended to me by a friend. There were a lot of good things being said about this anime so I decided to watch it. The first episode wasn't anything special and it didn't really introduce the audience to the story. However, I don't judge an anime by its first episodes so I went along with it. Honestly, I didn't understand what people found so exciting about the first episode, I can only guess it was when Seikawa asked Nishinosono 'What are the 3 big questions of life' to which she replied 'Who am I? Why am I here? Andwhere will I go?' Now, if you like anime with big psychological plots and questions, this might be the perfect anime for you.\\n\\n\r\nThe story was different and for the most part kept you interested and involved although there were times where it felt like the story stopped in order for the characters to talk about the deepest of the deepest of stuff. Again, if you like deep and emotional(less) dialogues in anime, this will be perfect for you. As for the pace, the story does start slow and like it doesn't have much to offer but after about 3 or 4 episodes, it does start to get interesting.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was dull and gloomy although this does add to the mystery and the eerie feel in the anime. It wasn't anything special so if you decide to watch Subete ga F ni Naru don't expect amazing art. Good News though! If you like funky openings with pretty colours and awesome music then you're going to like the one for Subete ga F ni Naru. It's one of the things that I enjoyed about the anime although when I first watched it I thought the anime was going to be about something completely different.\\n\\n\r\nThere's not much to say about the sound. The music used for the opening and the ending was catchy and I have it in my playlist but there wasn't much sound or sound effects, not that I noticed anyway so if there was some music during the scenes, the producers didn't do a very good job at making me realise it therefore making it impossible to appreciate the beauty of music.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were interesting, I don't think there was one character in the anime that I didn't like. Each character looked different and I probably won't be seeing any other anime characters that look similar to the ones in Subete ga F ni Naru. This is another thing that I enjoyed about he anime, the individualistic characters and their simple yet unique design. Their personalities were also all so distinct and contrasting and not one character had the same personality as the other. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, the anime was pretty decent and quite enjoyable although it does start of slow and ordinary but does pick up the pace and keeps the audience wanting more. I wouldn't consider this anime to be a high priority to watch but it definitely deserves to be given a chance, this might one day become a classic.\\n\\n\r\n(Story= 7, Art= 6, Sound= 4, Character= 8, Enjoyment= 7, Overall=7)\\n\\n",

It must be a good one judging by all these scores.\r\n-Eleven episodes later-\r\nWell that was... mixed.\r\nArt is a-ok. There are some pretty nice parts, I'll spoil a bit and say they get into the water before those, but overall it was nothing special. Let's give it a 7 and this is mostly because of that damn awesomeopening.\\n\\n\r\nSound was existent. There was not much special about it tho that opening song was a bit above average. Here's a 6.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory takes place on an island where a murder happens and our two protagonists try to solve it. Of course this shouldn't be a hard task to them cause they are super geniuses, cause isn't everybody these days? There's a main story in current time and a side story in the past. Now the anime began with an episode that slowly introduced us to two leads and their chemistry. ,, Nice, pacing!'' I told to myself foolishly. There's a difference between pacing and slogging an anime for 8 episodes! Well that might've given my opinion on the story. Most of the anime is spent with a female main character trying not to soil her panties in public over the main lead character, and flipping out whenever a girl involved in his life shows up. There's also both characters getting involved in extremely boring conversations about life, death and breakfast. This could've been interesting, deep or thought provoking if it wasn't all on the level of a pothead reading Nietzsche. Usually theories drawn are completely face palm inducing, like considering that a person with multiple personalities is ,,the purest human being,,. Now I gotta give the anime some credit, actually quite a decent amount of it. The solution to the mystery and killer's plan was so in depth you could find oil. It did keep me in awe how complex, in a good way, it was. Howeeeever there was another bitter pill to swallow before the ending which was killer's motive. The killer tells us the alleged motive but soon contradicts it with the following action. I am aware that mysteries are slow moving but those I've seen thus far kept me intrigued. This is by no means a horrible story and I am doubtless that quite a portion of people out there will love it. From me it gets a 6.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are mostly a rim-ram-shim-sham of nerdy folk. There isn't some overwhelming character displayed by anybody  but two main characters. Sohei is sorta cold, always thinking about life and wishes for complete freedom. His subordinate, Moe, is quite emotional which she displays whenever she feels like her feelings for Sohei are showing or a girl approaches/talks about him. Characters can pass with a 6 cause they were also annoying with their constant repetition of obvious things like ,,X was killed,, , ,,they were killed in that room,,.  Seriously script writer insert whatever but stop repeating stuff.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment is 5. Enjoying 3 out of 11 episodes is more of a 3 but considering those eps were damn good I felt like it should be recognized.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is obviously been done by somebody who had this awesome idea for a convoluted murder but couldn't think of a way to fill the time till the reveal of the murderer and things as such.",

            "content": "The Perfect Insider isn\u2019t an anime for everyone. As a mystery anime one can expect a dialogue-heavy presentation. This anime did have many expectations to exceed, due to the lack of genuine mystery anime in recent lineups. However, The Perfect Insider is quite an interesting murder mystery, as it primarily takes place in one location, focusing on a small cast of characters. Its slow pace creates tension at times, hoverer at times it can feel like a drag. Dialogue-heavy moments are at times interesting, however at times it seems it\u2019s all leading to nowhere. However, as a mystery anime, it is important for its plotto be good, but is it?\\n\\n\r\n~{Story}~\\n\r\nThe story is about a professor, Saikawa, and his mentor\u2019s daughter, Nishinosono, travel to an island to meet Magata, an intelligent programmer and an idol to Saikawa. When the two get there, they find out Magata has been murdered. The plot revolves around the two trying to solve the problem, with sprinkles of Magata\u2019s past being thrown around here and there. For a mystery anime to be any good, it must present a good storyline and this anime doesn\u2019t disappoint. Though at times, it can be predictable for some, the buildup for its plot twists make the delivery great. The ending was very satisfying, especially after many episodes of buildup before it. But here is the problem, the anime heavily relies on buildup plot points to the point where the audience lose interest. The anime\u2019s pacing, which I will talk about more later, is unfortunately very slow, as many episodes progress the story pinch-by-pinch. And as a dialogue-heavy anime, many of its dialogue rarely move the storyline and it feels like as if the writing is stalling with the audience. However, undeniably the anime still presents a very interesting storyline and at times it can get you at the edge of your seats.\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Presentation}~\\n\r\nAs a mystery anime, the style of the anime does create a unique feel to it. Its cinematography style gives the anime a very cinematic feel which makes this anime better than what it is. However, as I mentioned before, the pacing is a massive drag at some points. You will watch some episodes, only to know the plot has moved barely an inch. Characters can talk for ten minutes, but only one is builds up the plot and two adds some character development. With the cinematic style of the anime, I couldn\u2019t help but think how much better this anime would have been better if it was a two-hour long anime film rather than a series. The pacing would have been much more improved and it would feel more interesting for the audience. For a mystery, it is important to have a good pace to it. If it\u2019s too fast, the suspense buildup won\u2019t be there. If it\u2019s too slow, it\u2019s will start to break apart and feel less and less interesting. The Perfect Insider falls in the latter. However, its style does redeem it presentation by a bit.\\n\r\nPresentation: 6/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Character}~\\n\r\nThe anime consists of three main characters, and the story revolves around their relationship with one another and how compatible they are together. The protagonist of the anime, Saikawa Souhei, is a very interesting character, as he is shown as times as a genius, and other times lost. His interactions with another main character, Nishinosono Moe, is fairly interesting, as most of the anime consists of conversations between the two. If both characters were uninteresting and dumb, the anime would have felt like a terrible drag, but luckily if manages to have great characters. Nishinosono at first felt like a dumb addition to the cast, however she quickly proved that her deductive and observation skills are top-notch, and at times, better than Saikawa. The anime\u2019s third main character, Magata Shiki, is what makes this anime better than what it already is. She\u2019s creepy, she\u2019s mysterious, and she\u2019s the one who leaves more questions unanswered than answered. Throughout the series, there\u2019s sprinkles of her backstory here and there and they all manage to build up tension. This anime does have a sort of love triangle situation in some ways, but it\u2019s too unique to be considered as one.\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Art}~, \\n\r\nAs it is an A-1 Pictures anime, one can expect a lot to be delivered from here, and they didn\u2019t disappoint. The art style however is far different from what they normally use. At first you will notice that the color palette is very limited, as every color has a greyish tint to it. This adds for a subtle, mysterious style for the anime and manages to make the situations feel more and more tense. And as most of the anime takes place in a facility, you\u2019ll be seeing the color grey quite a lot. The backgrounds are very well detailed at times, and some of the more strange settings look great with their color palette. Character designs are also quite unique. Their facial structure has some depth shown, such as their eyes being more inside their face, and their skin color having a greyish tint to it. The art style helps in adding more to its mystery genre, and it make it stand out more than the rest of the other anime in the lineup. \\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Animation}~\\n\r\nAnimation quality is also top-notch, which is to be expected from A-1 pictures. The animations are fluid and very organized. And the animations have a realistic feel to it, just like it\u2019s art style, therefore the two perfectly blend together to create a unique presentation. As a more of a different anime for A-1 Pictures to do, they managers to be consistently good with the animation quality of this anime. Though some of the CG usage can feel weird at times, specifically at the movement of vehicles, but overall it isn\u2019t anything too bad. Also it\u2019s rotoscoped OP is pretty cool, as rotoscoping was done properly there.\\n\r\nAnimation: 8/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Voice Acting}~\\n\r\nThe main cast of the anime is voice acted by, well, pretty unknown seiyuu. Kase Yasuyuki does Saikawa well, even though he is unexperienced with doing main character roles. However he is able to give a more mature feel to Saikawa pretty effectively. Tanezaki Atsumi does Nishinosono pretty well to, and gives the character a decent range of tone depending on the situation. At first I thought Hanazawa Kana did Nishinosono, because Tanezaki does almost just like her in this anime. Kido Ibuki does Magata Shiki, which happens to be a totally unique role for her as she mostly did jolly type of characters. She manages to do well with Magata, giving the character a solemn and mysterious tone, and bring the character to life. Some popular seiyuu such as Horie Yui and Hikasa Yoko also have a role in this anime, but it\u2019s barely there to notice that they were part of it at all. Overall, the main cast does a decent job with the voice acting.\\n\r\nVoice Acting: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Music}~\\n\r\nThe opening of this anime really reminds me of Death Parade, because the tone of the OP is different from the tone of the anime. The OP \u201ctalking\u201d is quite catchy and ended up being one of my favorite OP of the season. And the rotoscoped presentation of the OP really looks good. The Ending is really good to, and I\u2019m not quite sure if it\u2019s matches the tone of the anime or not. The ED \u201cNana Hitsuji\u201d is really good to listen too. However the overall OST and background music is okay. The background music rarely adds to the suspense of the anime, if it\u2019s there that is. For most of the time, the anime lacks background music. At times it works, at time it doesn\u2019t, especially when some scenes crave for some background music to add suspense. Even if the OST is a mixed bad, at least the OP and ED is fantastic.\\n\r\nMusic: 7/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Enjoyment}~\\n\r\nThe anime would have been a lot better if the pacing was better. Most of the episodes, I started losing interest, and It made me check the time over and over again. And some of the dialogue in the anime is there just for the sake of dragging this anime, rather than actually adding something. However this is such a shame, especially since the plot and characters are great, and those the major reasons why the anime can still be considered good. If only the pacing would have been better, this anime could have been so, so, so much more. This would have worked more if this was a movie rather than a series.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nIn the end The Perfect Insider is worth checking out for its story and characters and it\u2019s delivery in suspense and mystery. The pacing and some unnecessary pacing does pull the anime down to a place where it doesn\u2019t deserve to be. Its lack of background music at times also is disappointing as background music in a mystery anime can do a lot more to the content. It\u2019s sad to such great content be pulled down by some major flaws, but in the end, The Perfect Insider has some great plus points that makes it a good anime.\\n\\n\r\n+ Great plot and storyline and plot twists feel just right.\\n\r\n+ Interesting cast of characters and their interactions with one another is top-notch.\\n\r\n+ Unique art style and animation.\\n\r\n+ The OP and ED are great.\\n\r\n- Terrible pacing at times with some dialogues leading up to nowhere.\\n\r\n- Lack of background music at times and OST isn\u2019t anything special.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.3/10",

I know everyone hates dialogue but in my opinion those dialogue's for me very entertaining, you need to understand and think about it, it is as i said realistic animewith realistic questions. Probably everyone used to with echi, harem, etc where dialogue is just simple, where 10years old kid can understand. Im the guy who likes philosophical and smart anime's. I love Death note, code geass, one outs, steins;gate. If you one of those fans and really like smart anime here it is. I rated 9 because i love smart, philosophical, mystery anime's and everyone knows, that of all in the world anime, there is only 1% anime where involves smart, mind-gaming things.",

            "content": "The following review, while it doesn't contain spoilers, may give you more insight into the structure of The Perfect Insider than I would personally have wanted to have going into it. Heck, I didn't even know that it was a mystery (which was a nice treat for me), but I'm assuming you know at least that much if you're reading this. Anyway, I recommend watching this, especially if you're into thinking philosophically and solving mysteries as it's one of the best shows/movies I've seen in that regard, never mind just in the anime. You can come back and read the review later if you don'twant to be expecting certain general things to come up during the show, which I think would provide the best experience.\\n\\n\r\n----------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nDo you know how mystery television or film falls into two categories? The ones that throw bogus clues and evidence out there to mislead you until the grand reveal and the ones that give you legitimate clues you can use to figure everything out without having to guess at some point before the end? Well, fortunately, this show falls into the latter category, and damn does it do a good job of it. I haven't had the pleasure of watching much, if anything, that struck this kind of balance in a long time. Generally speaking, I either have everything figured out, or there isn't enough info/too much misleading/incorrect info to get to a conclusion without a leap of faith or without waiting until right near the end. This anime gave us all the clues we needed to solve the mystery within the first 3 episodes if I remember correctly which is coincidentally around when the mystery starts. It's kind of novel to have a show give you everything you need to solve the mystery right around the time the mystery is in place. Well, to a certain extent anyway. There's more that gets filled out as you move through the story that could be considered key to figuring out what happened, but even those final bits are given to you a decent enough chunk of episodes before the end.\\n\\n\r\nNow that I've established that they did the whole mystery thing basically flawlessly in my opinion, I would like to say that it has also been a treat to have one of these shows conduct themselves fairly and still manage to trick me, even while doling out clues the whole time. That doesn't happen very often. If I had to pick a criticism of the mystery, it's that if you're not paying very close attention, and if you're not...well, clever at this sort of thing, you may feel that the reveals come out of left field and are a load of crap - as many people who have reviewed this do.\\n\\n\r\nOnwards! The art and animation is really well done and the sound is definitely a treat. Their attention to detail really shows, especially during one of the best openings and one of the best endings I've ever seen. The questions I found myself musing after and during every episode were also really well posited, if maybe a little shoehorned into things. That being said, I felt like it was in one of the main characters' nature to speak the way he did and I found myself identifying with him more than anyone else. So while it was shoehorned, the character who was doing the philosophy shoehorning was doing it believably (for me at least - there are enough reviews that disagree, and I won't bother using the old \"They didn't understand\" or \"They didn't get the character\" arguments). For a longer, clearer, picture of why I liked this part of the show, read this review since I agree with pretty much everything they say http://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=205880\\n\\n\r\nNow to the negative.\\n\\n\r\nThe main bad thing I have to say about all of this (minus the usual personal opinion stuff that you'll decide for yourself if you watch it) is that the characters were pretty weak overall. I thought that each one served a purpose, and some of them were interesting enough, but it was definitely the plot, story, philosophy, and them making me think all the time that took me through this. If it was just the characters alone trying to carry this in a different situation, I don't think I would have been interested past the philosophical questions that the main character I was talking about spits out. This is in contrast to say, Death Note as the easy example, where I could watch L and Light trying to open competing hotdog stands and it would be enthralling. In The Perfect Insider, the characters are a vehicle for the story, not the other way around. Anyway, to sum it all up, just read the first part of the review that warned you not to read the review ;) Enjoy!",

            "content": "I would liken this anime to a peaceful dream.  \r\nI'll rush past art and sound since my years of watching anime has convinced me that they're highly subjective, so the only thing I can objectively say about them is that they draw together nicely and have a flow to them as do many anime.  As for the story, the main plot line itself, the mystery about which it all revolves, I confess I did not find it too interesting and found myself asking a question at the start which proved to be the correct path of reasoning.  Still, I quite enjoyed thisanime, and will go on to explain why I do liken it to a peaceful dream.\\n\\n\r\nIn this anime our primary characters are all geniuses who can perform calculator operations in their heads without a moment's thought, are well regarded by the world despite each begin a recluse in their own way, and strangely enough within this anime their genius means they're each philosophically inclined.  Now as often happens when writing about people smarter then ourselves, many of the arguments, chains of reasoning, and claims of these characters could be easily poked full of holes by any deeper thought, but the real guts of the anime are the philosophical abstractions that get tossed about, or at least they are in my book.  Are we really meat and bone, or are we consciousness?  What can we define as a distinct individual when we collect multiple personalities within an individual, or when we acknowledge that no one personality is necessarily inherent to a body in and of itself?  Now, because they're all geniuses discussing deep topics the story does not scrutinize their thoughts to the extend to riddling them with holes, but rather glides along with them, much as logic might follow in a dream where in truth the contradictions matter little in the face of the new thoughts and ideas they might give birth to, and to me this seemed to be the dominant theme of the anime.  Still, having given critical and non-critical thought alike to the anime, I enjoyed the notions it expressed.\\n\\n\r\nWhile it's not too hard to find anime that tackle the nihilism behind our  not knowing precisely why we exist, this anime deviates from the grittier dark side of not knowing, and instead embraces that whilst we do irrationally fear \"death\", and we don't really know the answers to the big questions about life, accepting its lack of logic at times and emphasizing that that sometimes the simple seemingly random habits of life themselves are the answer to these questions however nonsense that may be.  I also enjoyed that this anime did not belabor the point by lingering endlessly on just these questions, delving into deep brooding depression for episodes on end as the characters thought their way through them, but rather it somewhat playfully tossed out questions and answers both as free floating thoughts more in the spirit of a stream of consciousness then as a logically defined argument or a dramatic plot line.  And that is why it is that I associate the feel of this anime to that of a peaceful dream, flowing on through ceaseless thoughts without violent refutes or blood rushing excitement.  I cannot say if you'll like this anime as I have, but that is not something for me to decide, it's something for you.",

            "content": "I hope you will find this review short & succinct, while still informative. I'll spend most of my review on the story and characters.\r\nSTORY: \r\nI quite enjoyed the first 4-5 episodes. These episodes hooked me by setting up what seemed to be a well-thought out mystery; they introduce an intriguing yet questionable relationship between two of the main protagonists; and discussions regarding Computer Science (CS) were relatively believable and without any blatant misuse of jargon. \r\nUnfortunately the mystery element stagnates and is quickly replaced by philosophical ramblings and unconvincing attempts at character development, all dressed up as Saikama's genius slowly whittling away at the mystery.It's not enjoyable to watch Saikama piece together the mystery while viewers are left ignorant of his revelations, instead having to sit through Nishinoso's attempts at getting his attention.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Nishinoso she too quickly becomes one-dimensional. Rather than moving the plot forward she exists only to hinder it. Her role is to pine after Saikama, assuring him she'll eventually catch up to him and figure out everything on her own. Saikama's responses are ambiguous; we're never sure if he's completely oblivious or just silently accepting her affection as a big-brother type (with both possibilities having been hinted at.) There's effectively no character development, and the only attempt at exploring their relationship exists as a short flashback. As for the other characters: both non-essential side characters and the main antagonist(s?) are lacking exposition and never really given the attention they deserved.\\n\\n\r\nART: \\n\\n\r\nIt's animated very well, although there's nothing particularly flashy in terms of color or scenery. I would describe it as solid and believable, but nothing to write home about. The most aesthetically pleasing bit of art in the show might actually be the ED.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: \\n\\n\r\nENGRISH. ENGRISH, SO BAD. EARS, THEY BLEED. In all fairness this is only one scene, but it draws on far too long and the rest of the sound is not very memorable. The OP and ED music were worth a listen ... one was rather catchy, but neither will end up on my playlists.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\\n\r\nAs noted in the discussion on story and characters, I enjoyed the early episodes, but as the story continued it became harder and harder to sit through. I was relieved when it was time for the big reveal, and while the explanation pleased my internal CS nerd it came far from satisfying my curiosity. There were a number of unanswered questions that were shrugged off with [paraphrasing] \"We may never know,\" or just completely ignored. I'm left frustrated and wanting an English translation of the source work, since it's hard to imagine that such a half-baked mystery came out of an award-winning novel. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\\n\r\nIf you like mysteries you might be interested at first, but this mystery will leave you questioning both the story and your decision to engage in it. If you can read Japanese I'd wager you're much better off reading the book.",

            "content": "Prepare for a hurting in your brain.\r\n\"Subete fa F ni Naru: The Perfect Insider\" is heavy with philosophical concepts about LIFE, so if you don't like that kind of stuff, stay away from it. I mean, you could watch it for the mystery (which is also very intriguing mind you) but it's biggest theme is on the meaning of freedom so pick and chose. \r\nThe mystery itself is very well done. It spends a good bulk of the series trying to figure out how the mystery was completed as well as the why. It was kind of frustrating though when Saikawa says he's found outthe mystery half way through the series but doesn't tell you since you are on the same side as Nishinosono, who's trying to figure out the mystery for herself (but never does and the solution ends up getting explained by Saikawa in the second to last episode anyway). Each episodes does a good job in setting up for the next one, and curiosity will get the better of you and force you to watch the whole series just to figure out how this act was committed.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like philosophy, the series is also a good watch. The characters are thoughtful characters (Well two of them are) who think about the meaning of a lot of things. You also get a good look at the thought process of Magata Shiki, who is the main focus of the series. I actually still can't decide whether Magata is delusional or a genius, but she certainly as an interesting way at viewing life. Saikawa is the more down to earth version of Magata who makes Magata's thought process a bit easier to understand. All in all, her view of the world and on life and death is kind of insane but also makes a sort of sense. I can see where she came from even if it's completely insane in your head. I wish I could voice the sentiment a bit more eloquently but I don't think I can so I recommend you watch the anime and come up with your own answer and opinion about Magata Shiki. \\n\\n\r\nIt was a great watch and each episode got me wanting more. The story isn't cliche at all despite the mystery being the great \"locked room\" case. I mean, my brain hurt a bit trying to organize and process all the information into my head, but all in all, it was a great series! You just have to think a lot while watching it. Heh.",

            "content": "There are many animes, especially in the mystery genre, that either go way above-the-top and become unrealistic or supernatural in trying to appeal to its viewers or follow a very tried-and-tested route and become too cliche and simple and are unable to satisfy its audience. Its not an easy act to obtain a balance and I feel 'Perfect Insider' manages to do just that. It brings a few new things to the table and keeps it all real and consistent throughout.\r\nEpisodes : 11\r\nGenre : Mystery, Thriller\r\nFormat : One long mystery from start to end that spans across 11 episodes\r\nPeople it might appeal to : Peoplewho like a good mystery and are fans of detective series or novels. People who don't mind a detailed in-depth case that takes its time to present all the facts and delve into the motives and psychology behind the suspects and victims.\\n\\n\r\nPeople it may not appeal to : People who want things crisp and quick and with a good dose of action. People looking for over-the-top action or comedy and expressive characters. People who get turned off by the slightest hint of psychology discussions, self-questioning, existentialism debates etc.\\n\\n\r\nStory : 9/10\\n\r\nThe synopsis explains the premise well. I wouldn't want to give further details coz its a mystery plot but I would like to say that overall its a good story. It has its exciting moments and a very fulfilling conclusion that befits the tone set at the start. It keeps you engaged throughout with new discoveries and clues in every episode that keep adding to the mystery. I cut 1 point because there are some very minor loopholes I could catch.\\n\\n\r\nArt : 8/10\\n\r\nI really like this type of art. To give you a good idea the art is very similar to Ao no exorcist or Shin Sekai Yori. Its not very colorful or bright to be honest which I didn't mind. The characters are very well drawn with a focus on their facial expressions. At times though, there is a feeling of rigidity in scenes involving long conversations between characters.\\n\\n\r\nSound : 8/10\\n\r\nI totally loved the opening and ending themes and the visuals along with them. They are very different from your usual stuff and really caught my attention. I found myself listening to them in every episode without fail. Regarding the background score of the anime, I would say its ok. Nothing great. I guess the similarity of the tone and setting throughout the anime  doesn't really give too much scope for a varied musical score.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 9/10\\n\r\nThis is where I feel the anime really scores. Lots of times in mystery anime or novels, the characters just end up being mediums for discussion of the case and don't have real personality. Here, that has been avoided. Our main 3 characters are wonderfully done and each his/her own unique traits and habits. Saikawa-sensei beats down many cliches with his calm and almost lifeless demeanor. I actually enjoyed his character a lot. The crazy genius of Dr. Magata Shiki came across brilliantly and towards the end you start understanding her psyche. But, my favorite was Nishinosono who totally looked like someone who might irritate me at the start (Dont judge a book by its cover. Lesson learnt) but turned out a joy to watch. She's been crafted as a very smart and confident girl who has her weaknesses and demons too. Again the anime displayed a good balancing act by not making her too overbearing and all-knowing or damsel-like and ready-to-cry either. The interactions between these 3 are the highlights of the series. Again I've cut 1 coz the other support characters never really came out much\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 10/10\\n\r\nI found myself wanting to see the next episode immediately after I completed one, was making guesses and theories after each clue was discussed and was amazingly fulfilled with the solution and conclusion of the case. If that doesn't count for a 10/10 on a mystery case, what does? Also, I really liked the conversations about existentialism, psychology etc. between the main characters. It never felt like going to the mind-fuck or above-your-head range (yes, I'm looking at you GITS!) but it presented some crazy ideas and theories nevertheless. And all of them were very relevant to the case not random plants to further the creators theories or anything.\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 9/10\\n\r\nAll in all, Perfect Insider gets a 9 from me. I might have been a little soft on this one coz I know its not easy to come up with a really good mystery. The anime has its minor flaws but I'm really willing to overlook them for all the good stuff it manages to do by the end of the ride. I was only wishing there were more mystery anime involving Saikawa and Nishinimono like the novels.\\n\r\nIf a good mystery or thriller is what gets you going, don't miss this one.",

            "content": "I never felt especially into Perfect Insider. Oh, it's competant enough; the pacing is fine, some of the characters are engaging, it's intriguing, and it was always a nice change of pace from superpowered teens at school going on about how much they want to have sex but never actually doing it.\r\nBut I didn't really get much out of it. It's necessarily slow paced to build atmosphere and mystery, but that often made it a bit boring. When everything was ultimately revealed, while it was kind of clever, it just didn't make much of an impression on me.\r\nPart of it is that there's so muchempty philosophizing. Especially in the ending. The revelations just get bogged down in all this clever and insightful dialogue that really isn't either of those things. I kind of checked out halfway through episode 10 if I'm honest.\\n\\n\r\nWith something uninventive but servicable, it's tempting to use the analogy of a plain, buttered bagel. Well this is a little better than that. It's a raisin bagel.",

            "content": "You can a apply a version of the popular maxim \u201cthe journey is more important than the destination\u201d to many works of storytelling, in order to justify the fact that you love it despite a disappointing ending. My most recent such application was the epic manga Kozure Ookami. The one genre that you can not apply this maxim is the murder mystery. Subete ga F ni Naru had a poor ending of such magnitude that I cannot recommend it to anyone, and this review should end right here.\r\nSomebody might ask \u201cyes, but what about the journey?\u201d So for reasons of thoroughness and fairness, I shallcontinue. The anime immediately shows typical noitaminA stylization with a great OP (the ED is also good), although when the actual episode begins we are served with mediocre animation. It's probably a matter of taste, but I really don't like poorly rendered 3d CGI objects festering the scenes. \\n\\n\r\nThe other major issue is the characters. The main \u201cdetective duo\u201d is pretty cool, we have the genius ojou-sama and the \u201cgenuis-er\u201d professor, but throughout the 11 episodes we learn nothing more of substance about them and no development occurs. But our duo is not the main problem, the main problem about the characters is the supporting cast: there are characters that have the potential of becoming interesting and we wait to discover how they will factor in the story etc, but nothing happens, they just disappear in the background. Magata's sister is the prime example. This anime looked pretty interesting in the first three episodes, but then simply blew over. Magata's character is pretty complex and interesting, but again: the poor ending ruins everything. \\n\\n\r\nMagata's character brings us to the only strength of the anime: It offers some philosophical thoughts worth contemplating (mainly using Magata as the transmission vessel). Also the lab structure as a self-sustaining micro-society of intellectuals is a beautiful contraption. So around Magata, the writes manages to create a beautiful setting, which I imagine is the sole reason for his success with this work. \\n\\n\r\nI will not spoil anything about the end, I'll just say that it has major timing issues and that it demands that we accept actions and motives based on their aesthetic value, completely disregarding logic or offering a valid explanation. You get a \u201cwow\u201d moment in episode 9 but that's it. Oh, and the \u201cF reveal\u201d is pretty dumb. \\n\\n\r\nThe murder mystery portion of the anime ends in episode 10, the final episode is a few pretentious dialog and a hormone overflowing Nishinosono. The fact that they gave up on the cyberpunk charm of the earlier episodes annoyed me; instead they chose to do the lazy \u201cpeople talking on changing backgrounds\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nAs I already said this anime fails as a murder mystery, but I imagine the near-future-cyberpunk aesthetics may make some people happy. The whole manga/anime industry seems to fail hard at the crime mystery genre (if someone thinks I'm wrong about this point, I would love to hear suggestions), so for the genre's lovers I would recommend the first season of Broadchurch and the Murder on orient express (1974). For this one... 3.5/10.",

I believe its very hard to cut a clear picture till everything is done you are hinted and given little clues a long the way. Then right at the end everything locks into place. I feel like this series had a very interesting story and plot to it. With out of the ordinary characters and really awesome visuals this was made out to be a awesome mystery anime series.",

            "content": "To really enjoy this anime you have to do the thing the characters do most: think (a lot). I believe that the story starts a little bit different that your usual animation, meaning that from episode one your stuck with a slow paced work. This is a project that requires a lot of character development and ends with a plot twist that is not usually expected on much of todays content. So give it time and enjoy the characters \"thinking out loud\" attitude that is rarely seen.\r\nProbably the most fun or entertaining part of Subete ga F ni Naru is giving yourself enough time tocome up with your own theories on many of the clues regarding the murders, only to get even more exited when reaching the end and seeing the big plot twist that broke the internet (or the part that is interested in this type of content) when this was being broadcast.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, if your thirst for mystery isn't quenched then I suggest you search for the rest of the S&M series (S&M stands for Saikawa and Moe) or maybe take an interest in the live-action in which you'll be treated for more content regarding the protagonists of this anime.\\n",

            "content": "The Perfect Insider is an anime that I was interested in ever since it came out in winter 2015, mainly because of the interesting synopsis and the OP which was visually and sonically very pleasing, but I didn't see it until recently and honestly, I regret not watching this earlier.\r\nAs a mystery anime, The perfect insider does it's job very well. It keeps you guessing throughout and has a good suspense element. It's one of the better and more unique locked room mysteries that I've come across, It's just extremely dark and creepy and tries to get you hooked early on. Through 11 episodes itmanages to tell a good cohesive story through some smart characterization, The way they tackle the mystery is really good, They take an extremely logical approach to solving the case and that is one of the biggest strengths of the anime. The Sci-Fi part of this show I truly appreciate, mainly because the source material for this anime is a 1996 novel by Hiroshi Mori, The fact that he wrote it then and it's still so modern and relevant is a great thing and it also plays well into constructing the mystery and symbolically painting pictures.\\n\\n\r\nFrom a Technical aspect this is one of more Hipster anime I've seen in recent years, It's whole background design is very different, they use a lot of shapes and shit, Idk why but it looks great. The cinematography and camera are pleasantly weird, especially during conversations, it makes for a pretty noble experience, The characters are weird too, they aren't bound by any normal storytelling rules and as the mystery progresses it adds a lot of dimension to both the characters and the story. Another thing I love about this show is how they end each episode, It's always very strong and makes you want to immediately click the next episode. The music does a good job of complimenting the mystery and the eerie atmosphere, I love both the OP and ED, The OP is one of my all time favorites. The animation is consistent and strong throughout. No complaints here.\\n\\n\r\nComing to the cons, While the show does a good job tackling the science and mystery in a very intelligent way, It at times fails in some of the more normal human aspects, Like maybe relationships or maybe the grief after a death or maybe when the killer is probably around you but you want to go bed. It's kinda frustrating because this is truly an amazing mystery, Even if you make a good prediction, it will still be interesting to see how it plays out. But Some things are just a little unbelievable and forced, So yeah, that's quite a knock on this show. It is also extremely talkative and preachy, which I don't mind but a lot of people might get bored easily, this surely isn't an anime for everyone.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is was a great anime, not one that's for everyone but that's why I would recommend it to everyone. There's only one way to find out and that's you watching it, Love it or hate it, this is a mystery that you just can't miss. If you can make it past the first couple of episodes and still hang around, you're in for a real treat.\\n\\n\r\nMy Rating:- 8.25/10",

            "content": "Once in a while an anime comes into the scene that defies all genre conventions, and for me this season its Subete ga F Ni Naru. As one of the most polarising shows I've seen, many people either love it or hate it based on the first episode, with that opinion not usually standing through the whole series. I personally like the show a lot, but I will dread defending it as its a pretty surreal and not always comfortable experience.\r\nSubete ga F ni Naru is a mystery anime centred around Magata Shiki, a genius programmer trapped in a research facility. Our main protagonists aretwo quirky characters, a rich arrogant young lady by the name of Nishinosono Moe and a dry but smart professor, Saikawa Souhei, two quirky yet ordinary people who get caught up in something shocking that happens within the facility.\\n\\n\r\nThat does sound pretty standard, with the mystery genre having been done time and again across various TV anime and serial drama. However, I strangely find that the series's strongest point is in its uniqueness, its first episode already demonstrates one of the series' main quirks: copious amount of talking. Not even detective stuff, a lot of it is the dry talking as you would see in our daily lives. It might get boring for people who want some action, but it fleshes out each character's quirks really well in a unique manner. \\n\\n\r\nThe show does have a long length for its main plot of a single mystery, with extra time spent on fleshing out its characters, the interplay between Moe and Souhei being the main highlight of the show. The two of them have intense debates and its a joy seeing them play off one another. This character focused approach was to me a really interesting direction for a mystery story to take and one of my favourite parts of the show.\\n\\n\r\nI also liked how the show avoided a lot of the main pitfalls of the mystery genre, there were no illogical coincidences and the things that did not make sense were at least pretty unpredictable. There were no cheats or details hidden from the audience either, pretty refreshing for a mystery series.\\n\\n\r\nThe execution of the show is excellent, with a masterful soundtrack alongside dramatic camera angles and set pieces, making it really easy to get absorbed into its atmosphere. You will see vibrant and colourful scenery, cold and futuristic research facilities, even vast and otherworldly oceans. Each set piece is filled with the personality of the person inhabiting, making what is going on screen feel more natural. Especially notable is the contrast of the show, because of how mundane the things on screen sometimes look, the poignant moments really stand out with its surreal art design impressing the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nSubete ga F ni Naru is a breath of fresh air blowing into this anime scene littered with tropes. Fearlessly being unconventional, it stands as an example of a series that has some actual meaning to its surreality, not just randomness for its own sake, and I hope we get to see more series like it in future.",

At first the story seems like an interesting mystery set out to be solved by a genius teacher and his moe pupil, oh wait, it's her name that's Moe. Why? Anyway the characters are pretty bland. You have the genius teacher who wants to use logic and unintentionally makes everyone feel like an idiot. Then the student who's in love with said teacher for some reason. The most interesting character is the mysterious unaging Dr. Magata, who is another genius in coding and other unexplained programming. Seriously, the don't explain what she really does in theslightest. The problem is, once you get dialogue out of her, it's ambiguous statements about how life is a disease and death is the natural state of being. In the end the mystery is solved thanks to things no one would really figure out due to all information being processed mostly under unforeseen circumstances. The music and art is pretty good, but for the most part, everything else is pretty bland. It's nice to have characters that aren't all high schoolers for once, but there's nothing really special here. It's not bad, but not great.",

The relationship between the two mains is explored to a certain extent (as much as can be done in 13 eps) however, the main focusthroughout the anime is the mystery at hand. \\n\\n\r\nAlong with the soundtrack and the fantastic art style, I found this anime thoroughly enjoyable to watch. The only thing that disappoints me is that it was only 13 episodes long. In my opinion, it should have been at least 24.\\n\\n",

And not only computer program, they even used math to revealed the mystery. tbh i really like the way they revealed the mystery. So from overall story, i think the plot can be enjoyable to eveyone that understand it. it was tricky and msytery plot, that the only word that i can describe from the plot. 9/10\\n\\n\r\n*Art\\n\r\ni don't really know what to say to the animation or the art. it wasn't terrible and not bad too. just, okay...... it was not like i got bored because of the animation, i enjoy it, but still overall the animation is meh.... to me. instead of a good character design, sometimes the character design became a scary character design to me. 7/10 \\n\\n\r\n*Sound\\n\r\nObviously i really like the sountrack, especially the OP and the ED. so fitting the show. i felt like the OP and the ED were the one who made this show more better. the soundtrack in the show was good i guess. but when it got into a scary scene, the soundtrack changed into a scary ones too, that was so chilling to me. 9/10\\n\\n\r\n*Character \\n\r\nThe character was so unique. never seen a character like that before. the teacher, Moe and Magata. Moe personality isn't something that i never seen though, but the Teacher(Souhei) and Magata was indeed so unique. but Magata is unique in a bad way. i don't want to show any spoiler so you will understand what i mean if you watch it. the way they were thinking was too unique to me and tbh i like the way they thinking too. i think from the overall character i will give it 8/10 because Souhei and Magata were the only persone that i think is unique. \\n\\n\r\n*Enjoyment\\n\r\nObviously i enjoy it so much. it was a good show to watch and worth to watch, even thought it was so difficult to understand. and with mystery show, they obviously in a few episode they ended it with a cliffhanger and it made me curious more about what will happen next. 9/10 \\n\\n\r\nFrom overall score i give it 9/10. the reason is just because i enjoy the show. the animation wasn't something spectacular but the other looked great too me. \\n\\n\r\nHope this review can be helpful for you.\\n\r\nSorry for bad english, and....\\n\r\nThanks :D\\n",

She also happens to be held in high regard by the professor because of her high intelligence. Just to tease her professor further, Moe decides to make the annual camping trip to visit the remote island Mugata was being isolated at again. However, when they go to meet Mugata they discover her murdered, left with a severed body and in a weddingdress. Bothered about the odd questions she was asked during their meeting, Moe decides to take on the investigation herself together with her professor, Sohei.\\n\\n\r\nSo this is an Anime based on a mystery novel by Hiroshi Mori. Art style is clean and has a calm atmosphere to it most of the time. Everyone mostly goes about as if nothing happened but, it can also get really creepy when the mystery picks up again thanks to its good use of sound. Thankfully there's a bit of romance between teacher and student (!) who both kind of lighten up the show a bit. If you're a programmer, you might find the show interesting too because it's quite technical.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing for sure is, you won't want to watch this if you're after a nice bed time story.",

            "content": "*2nd Review so don't expect it to be great*\r\nMy sole reason for giving this a 7 is because I liked the mystery in it other than that the characters specially the main antagonist(in a way) had the most dull and retarded character I have seen in ages. So let's just get to this. \r\n            *Review will have spoilers* Simply because I can't tell what I likeand dislike about the show without spoiling it a bit. \\n\\n\r\nFirst start with the story, Magata Shiki is a genius programmer who has lived her life on a Island and doesn't meet any guests or anyone so basically a shut in and one day when Two MC arrived on the Island and went to that Facility to actually meet Dr.Magata but ended up investigating two murder cases which happened just when they were about to meet Dr.Magata. That's it for the plot. It turns the murder was of Dr.Magata Shiki actually and right after that a another murder acquired makes it two murder cases. Now what bothered me the most was the character of Dr.Magata Shiki and it seemed like I was the only one who couldn't feel any sympathy for her character or never even liked the character no matter how hard they tried to show her as a genius and a total intellect I just couldn't get over the fact that was a freaking MURDERER and that to of her own parents. Yeah she was murderer and everyone seemed to be inspired from her and completely ignoring the fact that she was actually a murderer except for the main girl in the show named \"Moe Nishinosono\" who actually gave two shits about the murder of her parents and why she did it. \\n\\n\r\nLet's talk about characters now. As I already mentioned Magata Shiki was a murderer but not only that she was a fucking psychopath who doens't have any valid reasons behind killing her parents(even if she did that still would't change the fact that she is a murderer) but instead she just killed them because she wants \"Freedom\" Yes that's right, FREEDOM. To her freedom means killing all those who might stop you from doing anything. This is just SICK and twisted, how can one even like her character is beyond me also she was a Emo retard quoting nonsense like \"Why do humans exist and shits like that\" throughout the series so I guess you have got an pretty good idea of what her character was like. Those two things aside she also killed her daughter just because she couldn't kill Magata Shiki. *Sigh* I don't understand why people like her so much like WHY? As for our MC named \"Sohei Saikawa\" a genius professor who admires the personality of Magata Shike and declares her as the \"Most Pure Human Ever\" do I need to say more? I guess you have got a pretty good idea of how big of a Emo he was and Lastly our Main Girl \"Moe Nishinosono\" who was mostly obsessed with the teacher but somehow actually had a brain and questioned the Morals of Dr. Magata Shiki. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe Mystery in this Anime was done pretty well in my opinion. The way story progressed was also pretty well-done. My only problem with the show is that they never really gave any solid reasoning behind the murder except that it was a form of showing \"Love\" really? LOL sorry with that kinda shit it's almost impossible to like the character of Magata Shiki. Her thoughts about humans were retarded, she was a murderer(Yes I will say it again and again) and above all that she was never caught and is living freely after committing all those crimes and never had any sign of regret like she just took the lives of 4 freaking people just because she had nothing better to do. People praising the hell out of Magata Shiki in the reviews is really really getting on my nerves now. \\n\\n\r\nAll and all this show is good however the characters specially the character of MAGATA SHIKI is beyond retarded.",

            "content": "Ok, a proper review from me finally. Since my last one regarding this terrible show got taken down.\r\n-SPOILERS BELOW-\r\nThis anime tries so very hard to be deep and psychological. In the least, it is not. This anime truly encompasses what someone who took psych 101 thinks psychology is.\r\nThe anime's take on Disassociation Identity Disorder is at most... very insulting to real people who suffer. They make it seem as though she chose to encompass these personalities for the fact that \"people don't accept her as herself\". While the author herself maybe a researcher she seemed to lack basic knowledge of abnormal psychology.\r\nMost people gain morepersonalities when they are exposed to EXTREME trauma. Such as: sexual abuse, intense physical and/or emotional abuse, or some other very traumatic experience (like a car crash that left someone injured very badly). And so on. From what I could tell, the characters made it seem like she encompassed more personalities because she was lonely because \"uwu im lonely :( gotta make more people to talk to\". This type of thing is very harmful, but what ever. The anime did what it did, can't change it now.\\n\\n\r\nNow, on to the thing that I think bothered me the most in this anime, she fucks her uncle. I believe his reasoning is because \"well she was 13 and very mature\".   Excuse me? What the fuck kinda excuse is this? She is mentally ill and he fucks her. Like what the ACTUAL fuck.\\n\\n\\n\r\n4/10 -would never recommend to anyone would strongly advise against.\\n\r\nOne redeeming quality? I guess I see what she was kinda going for with cool mystery, but these things can only be overlooked so far for me.\\n\\n",

            "content": "The whole time I was watching Subete ga F ni naru, I felt nothing but awe. The perfect insider fits its name perfectly. In its own way, it's flawless. I've always liked psychological and mystery themed plots cause it always makes me think. It triggers deep thinking that perhaps my brain slyly enjoys. And this anime, it's one of those.\r\nThe animation is splendid but then I was never really that attentive on such. Personally, It's beautiful. I've always loved the ocean and it was shown in the story for a couple of times. The concept was impressive as well. It was well thought too. SinceI've seen quite a few of the psychological anime, I've observed that some anime tries to appear to be intellectual that it comes to a point that it tries to mimic other elements from the other anime. It's indeed common in anime to have the same things and settings but that doesn't mean that it needs to be executed similarly too. I wouldn't name them since I'm also bad at remembering but I am sure I dropped some series cause of this. (I was never that active in mal so it doesn't really get updated either.)Also, I find it very impressive that there are no plot holes. If you seem to missed something, I guess you should watch it again. It was explained and shown. The story has a moderate pacing too so it wasn't really hard to catch up on what the characters were thinking. As for the characters, Dr. Magata sure is something. She's complicated but also simple at the same time. One of the things that I loved about her character was her unpredictability. She'll make it seem that you thought you had her all figure out but it's actually the opposite. She's interesting and a dangerous one too. The two main were great but sometimes the girl's talkativeness annoys me. It was bearable though. It's also essential in the series to complement Sensei's character. Be wary though, there's an illicit affair going on over some characters. It bothered me at some part but cause of that, I figured it out as well. It was fun coming up with answers xd Overall, I think it deserves a 9. I enjoyed it very much but it lacked something. I guess after perhaps figuring it out, when the revelation and conclusion happened in the last eps it wasn't that much surprising anymore. I guess that's why.\\n\\n\r\nTo think that a 5 year old child already had her own existential crisis, that sure is something. I agree to Sensei's statement that Dr. Magata is pure; a purity that can never be achieved by normal humans; a purity that breaks all the customary morals in our present society. I've always admired intelligent people perhaps it's cause of a silly reason too. It's that they're not afraid to be different and Dr. Magata is one of them. Although no matter how much she seeks for freedom, I don't think she'll ever achieve it. I believe she's a weak person, thus she creates personalities from people that once offered her a safe haven. I suppose that it imprisons her more. But then, I guess that's her version of reality and one can never truly understand it. The human mind is a complex matter. That fact alone makes everyone of us interesting individually. I must say that her questions really does make you think. \"Who are you?\" \"Why are you here?\" \"Where are you going?\" Questions that has no validity of correct answers. It's just a matter of your own conviction and morals.",

            "content": "Story 5/10\r\nIf I had to summarize this series in one word I would say \"over-complicated\". Sure, I like wild stories in mystery series as much of the next guy but The Perfect Insider takes it to a new level of unanswered questions and out-there theories that the main character just **suddenly realizes** with very limited investigation. If I had to describe it in another word, I would add \"frustrating\". The mystery begins in episode 2 (or 3?) and they don't do any actual investigation until episode seven. Everything up until then is a lazy romance plot that is very lackluster and a lot of repetitionof stuff the audience already knows. Numerous scenes where they just repeat \"What did he mean when he said that?\" and \"How did they get in and out of the room?\" and \"What does F stand for\" but the audience works with pretty much nothing while the protagonist and his lackey magically pull these extremely spot-on theories out of nowhere. I mean seriously, the audience gets to work with nothing and then the protagonist spouts about how \"obvious\" the answer was.\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10\\n\\n\r\nA bit inconsistent but primarily good. Overall character design, backgrounds, and animation quality were decent, but Nishinosono is an outlier in this because he design was pretty bad and she was the only one i noticed where sometimes her eyes weren't sitting even or her nose disappeared or something like that. The art was probably the best part of the series I'll just say that.\\n\\n\r\nSound 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe OP theme was really catchy but the use of sound effects, soundtrack and the ending theme were very bluh. Sound affects were at times abnormally loud for something like opening a book or setting down a cup, and then the soundtrack would be very mellow during a scene that was supposedly very dramatic and that was also confusing to me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 2/10\\n\\n\r\nArguably the most frustrating thing about this series were the characters. I don't really know why they bothered creating characters that only served the purpose of ooeing and aweing at Saikawa, the ultimate super-genius that nobody questions because he's so cool and complicated that he is just on a completely different level from anyone else blah blah blah. Saikawa was so flawed and nobody really acknowledged it because he deflects everything every character says with word vomit about how he understands the real world better than them. I mean, a bulk of the series is him praising this incestuous murderer as being the most enlightened and admirable person he knows. Seriously? Nobody is going to mention that? And Nishinosono was annoying as a character that was set up to be \"the cutesy one who fawns over Saikawa constantly\" but there are times where Saikawa directly rejects her and she freaks out and tries to hit him? Thats not exactly a great love story thats being set up is it? And all the other characters are on the back burner of importance as in they do nothing and don't stand out.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 3/10\\n\\n\r\nI'll admit it had me hooked with the concept of a \"locked room murder mystery\" but there is a literally a million more ways that the mystery could've been solved without the enormous amount of roundabouts and guessing that the characters did to get there. The only reason I'm giving it a 4 is that is wasn't genuinely terrible to watch until around episode 6 where I kind of realized that there was a lot of wasted time in between important events that the characters could've spent oh I don't know...investigating the murder they'd just been involved in instead of tossing around a lousy going-nowhere romance subplot that wasn't going to be fulfilled in the end anyway.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 4/10\\n\\n\r\nI'd grade it lower if not for the fact that it did keep my attention (which is more than I can say about some anime) and the art/op theme were appealing. The ending was not satisfying by any means, a lot of questions went unanswered (I'd list a few but they'd be spoilers) and the whole \"this crazy incestuous murdering woman was actually a super genius\" left a bad taste. Wouldn't recommend it honestly.",

That is to say, this anime is hospitably bizarre- if you approach it with humility.\r\nBizarre is defined as strange or unusual; or unfamiliar. What makes something familiar? Isn't it that we have seen it before? That's right, this anime provides none or inadequate context to properly explain most of the characteristics of the characters. The interactions themselves, however (save for a few flashbacks), are polite and courteous, even when there is conflict despite their ostensible oddness (for example, the director'sthumbs up). Furthermore, the odd idiosyncrasies of characters will easily make you chuckle (but not laugh).\\n\\n\r\nPhilosophically, this show questions \"madness\" in a way that is reminiscent of psychologists such as Thomas Szaz and R.D. Laing (does it exist, or is it simply beyond the understanding of most people?). The explicable (but decontextualized) actions of the protagonists and antagonists, which seem to frustrate some viewers, are actually consistent with what the show suggests: that madness is a cop-out of an explanation brought on by not enough understanding, and that us, the viewers, simply don't have enough knowledge to understand.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is enjoyable, but the world is incredibly sand-boxy. Anything you can imagine can exist because people are smart, and smart people can do anything. The seeming lack of effort and occasional Jimmy Neutron-esque clips before Saikawa's epiphanies are pretentious and distract us from the story. \\n\\n\r\nDespite some unnecessary sequences, Subete ga F ni Naru: The Perfect Insider will keep your attention, ask important questions, and then disappear without a trace.",

SPOILER FREE for your enjoyment.\r\nPROS:\r\n+ Pleasant, detailed animation; an interesting and fitting color scheme.  \r\n+ Enjoyable sound track, with a great OP and ED\r\n+ Nice voice acting\r\nCONS:\r\n- \"Mystery\" is predictable (At least for someone who has watched a lot of TV. By episode 5 it was pretty clear to me, yet it takes a VERY SLOW five episodes more for the characters to put it together).\r\n- Little characterization leads to one-dimensional characters (i.e., the \"young and in love,\" the \"suave man of intellect,\" the \"unfeeling genius,\" etc.)\r\n- Slow plot progression(I normally don't mind this; many murder mysteries seem slow as you gather the details that lead to the big reveal or twist, but even taking this into account, Perfect Insider lagged too much)\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nIf you're a fan of mysteries and don't mind a slow plot, give it a go. Because it's only 11 episodes, it doesn't take much time to complete. (But if, by episode 5, you think you have everything figured out, you're probably right.) \\n",

            "content": "To me this anime has two big themes that are really well developed: it's a mystery story but it is also an existential story. Both of them are treated pretty good. What do I mean by that?: the mystery plot is not overly simple neither overly complicated, they show all the evidence you would need to create a theory that will lead you to solve the mystery as long as you keep your mind open. In that sense is a good mystery show, it's not easily predictable (which would make it dull) but neither overly complicated (which would make it \"unfair\" as the viewer mightnot have all the elements to solve the mystery before or together with the characters).\\n\\n\r\nWith respect to the existentialsm inherent to some of the characteres, this could be a more personal opinion, but the thoughts discussed in the show are really interesting and I felt identified with a lot of them: freedom, human nature, life and death, etc. big topics that are not shallowy discussed as the characteres seem really coherent: characteres with a complicated past, with complicated personalities, with complicated thoughts about life, with contradictions and overwhelming emotions... you know, like humans tend to be.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the story a lot: I saw the whole show in one night (is very short so...) which means that it kept my interest and I wanted to know more about the story of the characteres and the resolution of the plot. This is pull out with only a few characters, which I think is very valuable (in some mystery anime they tend to include docens of characteres in the plot to confuse you and over complicate the argument). \\n\\n\r\nTo me the whole business with the computer and the maths its mostly complementary, it's not the centre of discussion neither the base of the argument (I work with coding and stuff like that, there was nothing deep related to it), it was just a way to show the sadness and freedom desire of the characters, as to them the digital world is a \"perfect\" world, as the digital world lacks everything that makes the real world a world where you want to escape from, a world where you suffer because you are constrained.\\n\\n\r\nIn summary, I highly recommend this anime to people that enjoys mystery plots and that also enjoys to contemplate exitentialist arguments that will keep you thinking for a few days later about these topics: some times I feel like I need another way to think about things, and the view this show presents is a very interesting one. Intersting thoughts, that's the best about this anime.",

            "content": "This journey was a mind blowing experience and a very refreshing mystery anime to see. As a fan of mystery genre of anime, I was delighted to finally find an anime which followed the archetype yet provide an out of this world story and experience.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nThis is the main attraction of this anime. Its story. Despite it having a slow start at the beginning and it being a very monotonous and boring anime at times, this is an anime about talking, as the opening suggests. The mystery is basically a locked room murder case, with no one entering the room for around 7 years already.It works very well as a mystery anime, as this is one of the most mind blowing locked room murder cases I have ever seen. To me, this mystery has used a commonly used murder mystery archetype and crafted it into something which is quite out of the box. And all this is done while having a side story of Magata Shiki at the end of the episode as well.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\r\nThe art in this anime tends to be very dull, which makes it not as interesting. Due to them usually being indoors as well, they are constantly surrounded by grey walls which further makes it unappealing.  The characters are also designed a little weird, with majority of them having very pale and whitish looking faces. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nThe anime does use background music from time to time in certain moments to provide atmosphere but does not utilize much in terms of background music as compared to other anime. Though it is more understandable as almost the entire show compromises of the characters talking on and on and on. One negative about he voice actors, especially Saikawa's is that they are very monotonous. This is a considerable downfall, especially when the main thing he does is talk. This makes the anime much more boring at several times.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6/10\\n\r\nFor this, there are only 3 main characters who we have to take note of. They are Saikawa sensei, Nishinosono Moe and Magata Shiki. With Magata being the most interesting of the lot to me. Saikawa and Nishinosono's relation ship is abasically her liking him and him friendzoning her. Their relation is also similar to that of a master is to a helper, with Saikawa figuring things out much quicker and much better than Nishinosono. Magata on the other hand is a professor who was the victim of a locked room murder. Magata is the character who is a genius and doesnt have any morals binding her. Saikawa is a slightly pretentious character at times who is interested in Magata in terms of how she thinks and such.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nPersonally, i enjoyed this very very much. As a person who enjoys mystery anime a lot, this one certainly did bring it to the table. There were a handful of plot twists here and there which made me go \"Woah\" a couple of times. Along with the right amount of information withheld and given to keep you at the edge of your seat. Even though there was that, most of the time, you would be listening to line after line of dialogue. During this time, one would either think about how the mystery would be solved or would be bored out of their minds. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nIn short, this is a very nicely crafted piece of mystery. However, despite how captivating the entire story was, most other aspects of the anime tend to be lacking. It falls short in terms of making the anime more entertaining. This causes the person watching to be very easily bored while watching.\\n\\n\r\nUnless the story makes up for it. Which is what I feel has happened. This is a very intriguing mystery which was what I felt unpredictable. It was a wild ride and provided a story which I could not see coming at all.\\n\r\nOverall, I give Subete ga F ni naru: The perfect insider a 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nI also apologize for my inability to express the mystery as I do not want to spoil anything. Thanks for reading.",

            "content": "Hello reader! You're in luck. If you're reading this, chances are you're interested in watching this show. This is one of the shows that are better as a binge watch than as a show that you pace yourself with or follow week per week. That's why you're lucky you get to watch this in one or two sittings! I was not so lucky and let me tell you why (just to brace yourself for what's in store for you). \r\nThe main reason had to be the story's pacing. It's horrible. There are lots of arguments saying that this is the kind of show that doesn'tspoon-feed you the answers to the mystery and that it expects you or allows you to solve the mystery with them. So definitely expect to have more and more questions instead of answers at the end of each episode (yes, up until the last one, too!) It can be frustrating, but once the reveal is there, it makes you want to rewatch earlier episodes to see what you have missed or if they have been building up for it all along.\\n\\n\r\nSubete ga F ni Naru's 1-cour season can actually be summed up in around 4 episodes, I feel like. Just in case you're not familiar with the source material, our main characters, Moe and Saikawa are kind of a Sherlock & Watson pair who deal with strange cases. There's also a Japanese live-action dorama already out where it chronicles their adventures. In it, what they have gone through in 12 episodes in this show is told in 2 episodes tops. So that's not to say that there's more tighter and more concise way of telling it.\\n\\n\r\nThere's really not too much action as most of the time is spent on discussions and dialogue. If that's your thing, then do check out this show! By any means, it's not a bad show per se. I find it hard-pressed to just write it off as bad, but it is indeed flawed. Without dragging this review on for too long, I do find its dialogue to be its best. We get to learn how the characters think, how they feel, and what they believe in without getting too on the nose. (Actual philosophy majors might actually be turned off from this though. The show can get pretentious at times and over-reaching to portray the characters as oh-so smart and deep.) However that alone couldn't save the whole storytelling of the series in my opinion. (If that's your thing then be my guest! Have at it!) There's only so much discussion and over-wrought ideas to be thrown around until it gets tedious and you're just left going \"Okay, we GET IT! So what now?\"\\n\\n\r\nOverall, would I recommend this show to anyone? Perhaps not. It's a polarizing show and I find myself in the 'No thanks, skip this one!' camp. Based on my experiences so far (after finishing the finale) I find myself telling my anime friends not to watch this show. But like I said, if you're into \"modern\" locked room mysteries with a dash of philosophical ideas on the side and wouldn't mind like 8 episodes of basically filler and talking, then you should give this a shot!",

Kys Don't get me wrong it did have some good suspense. It just lost my interest at some parts. A good point this anime deals with is morals.! Is it morally right to take a life for this? Etc. The last episode was a nice conclusion in my opinion though. \ud83d\ude42 I loved how obviously they showed the difference between the characters morals and values though. I wish this anime dived in more with Saikawa's past like they didwith Moe. I think it would have let me enjoy this anime more, to know why he is who he is then and why he thinks his morals like he does.",

            "content": "It\u2019s sad that the only mystery show of the year turned out to be a bit over the top and full of philosophy that most of the time seemed to be nonsensical. The Perfect Insider always played with weird philosophy, but it at least acknowledged that such philosophy was weird. The problem started right at the end of the show, just after the main mysteries (a little bit farfetched) were solved.\r\nIt also didn\u2019t help that the anime presented main characters that were a bit annoying as well. Souhei felt to be the know-it-all of the show, the one that knew everything about the world andlife, and a person who used such \u201cknowledge\u201d to make his own philosophy. Moe was a cocky little girl who just wanted to be noticed by her sensei. And Magata, well, we know about her at the end of the show, so there wasn\u2019t so many problems with her. However, the first two grew with time, as well as their relationship, which turned out to be the best part of the show, and the best part of the finale. Aa Souhei was the main \u201cdetective\u201d, he dropped his philosophical persona to be the one who explained the problems to us, something that helped him a lot to be more likeable. Moe grew a lot as well. Although she didn\u2019t give up her love for her sensei, she stopped wanting to impress Souhei and tried to be an equal to him. And thanks to her backstory, we could understand why she was a bit obsessed with her.\\n\\n\r\nThe mystery per se was understandable at the beginning, with some shocking twists right at the beginning of the anime, to great back story at the middle of it, with compelling development for Magata as well. But just by the end of the show, it went some way that didn\u2019t quite worked out for me. \\n\\n\r\nThe production values were nice. Animation and art were very interesting, especially during moments where our heroes enter a machine which materialized their thoughts, showing us some surreal and beautiful sceneries. The music was good as well, especially during the revelations and twists moments. The OP and the ED were really entertaining, being the former the one that stood out to me (watching our protagonists dancing is really amazing, especially Magata, who performs a ballet-like choreography which is simply beautiful). \\n\\n\r\nOverall, the show was entertaining and would be a nice gateway for newcomers to anime. Our main heroes grew up a lot during the 11 episodes. However, the mystery took twists that were too ridiculous, and the presence of almost nonsensical philosophy ruined everything by the end. Not the best, but not the worst thing ever.",
