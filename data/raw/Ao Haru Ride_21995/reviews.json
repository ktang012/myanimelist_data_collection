            "content": "\u201cSometimes people put up walls, not to keep others out, but to see who cares enough to break them down.\u201d\r\nIt\u2019s nice to see a series like \u2018Ao Haru Ride\u2019 surface every now and again. Something that takes a well-known storyline type and adds some unique elements to differ the experience a bit. Nothing revolutionary or mind-blowing (doesn\u2019t need to be), but unique - to a pleasant degree - nonetheless. To put it as simply as possible: a refreshing visit to a familiar kind of storyline.\r\n[STORY]\r\n-----------\r\nThere\u2019s nothing overly complicated about the core plot; a story of two past lovers (in mutual spirit) reuniting later intheir lives \u2013 a second chance. But, it\u2019s the underlying layers and nuances woven throughout the narrative that strengthen and elevate it (a little bit) above the clich\u00e9 romp it could have been.\\n\\n\r\nNow, that\u2019s not to say that some parts of the show won\u2019t have you thinking \u201cI know where this is going.\u201d or \u201cReally?\u201d But compared to many others storylines of this type (Hollywood movies, novels, etc.) this is quite refreshing in a multitude of ways\u2026\\n\\n\r\n\u2018Ao Haru Ride\u2019 thankfully helps ease the viewer through the inevitable drama by adding in unique characters with their own individual personalities, great humor (naturally occurring through the characters) and by giving the viewer some room to breathe. It helps negate the stress of the drama somewhat, allowing it to become a plus rather than a minus.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall, the plot is rather solid considering the material \u2013 don\u2019t expect perfection though.\\n\\n\r\n[ART]\\n\r\n--------\\n\r\nProduction I.G has once again done a great job using their high quality of animation (as they are well known for animating action and effect-heavy anime) to animate something more tame and simple. The animation is cheery, energetic and bright \u2013 with a color palette that matches that very well. There were no drops in quality that I could find, and the few scenes with lots of motion were done well too. \\n\\n\r\n[SOUND]\\n\r\n-------------\\n\r\nThe background music compliments the series well \u2013 enhancing the current scene or giving a sense of the emotions present during a silent moment. A few of the tracks stand out on their own too, especially the opening track that, while being fun and energetic, is also surprisingly calm. It makes for a lovely lyrical meld of two differing emotions. \\n\\n\r\nOn the voice-acting side of things, everything is great. Everyone was well cast and emoted well. I know that seems direct, short and to the point, but that\u2019s really all that needs to be said concerning the seiy\u016b and their performances \u2013 they did very well.\\n\\n\r\n[CHARACTER]\\n\r\n-------------------\\n\r\nSince the only outstanding things about the secondary characters also tie into underlying plot points not mentioned in the synopsis, I won\u2019t talk about anyone other than our main two: Yoshioka and Kou.\\n\\n\r\nFirst we have Yoshioka, our main character. Yoshioka is an energetic, good-natured, kind and boisterous girl who loves the company of other people and having fun. Her naivety, energy and charm make her a fun character to follow onscreen. She goes through some decent character development as she matures a little and meets new people \u2013 the most important of whom is her past love-interest (and second main character), Kou.\\n\\n\r\nKou is a very complicated character.  In the past he was soft-spoken, kind, and dedicated. Now though, he is much more aloof, dry, and tactless \u2013 but there are hints abundant that the old Kou is still in there somewhere. Over the course of the series, we find out more about him and what caused this change (which is all I can say without veering into spoiler territory). \\n\\n\r\n[ENJOYMENT]\\n\r\n--------------------\\n\r\nHonestly, I enjoyed this series a lot more than I thought I would. I heard good things, but still kept my expectations low as I always do when watching a new show. In its entirety, this anime managed to pleasantly exceed my expectations.\\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL]\\n\r\n---------------\\n\r\nIt\u2019s not the best melodrama anime out there, but it\u2019s not a horrible anime in any sense of the word either. What it is, is a rather well done love story that\u2019s definitely worth a watch. \\n\\n\\n\r\n~FINAL SCORES~\\n\r\n----------------------\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\n--------------------\\n\r\nOVERALL: 8\\n",

            "content": "Welcome to the Vanilla cafe. Would you like to pre-order a vanilla pudding with vanilla toppings from our vanilla menu?\r\nAo Haru Ride is a shoujo romance slice of life manga adaptation of the same name. It follows a story of a curious high-schooler girl wishing to find out what happened to her crush from three years ago and why did he change. It has \"generic\" and Kimi ni Todoke written all over it just from looking at the cover, and going deeper, it further proves this statement.\r\nPlot:\r\nFutaba Yoshioka is your average 1st year in high school, who wishes to change herself and find new friends.She stumbles across her middle school crush, Kou Tanaka, who has changed his name to Kou Mabuchi. Shocked to find his personality completely changed, she starts testing her feelings for him, all in attempt to find out what happened to his old self.\\n\\n\r\nThe premise screams vanilla and generic all over the place, and it is just as it looks. It is your average shoujo romance with a double unrelated love triangle introduced later on. There is just nothing driving the romance forward and it uses cheap gimmicks in an attempt to move it further but it is really an uninteresting story once you get familiar with the characters. The main love triangle feels very artificial and is only there to make some progress, and the secondary love triangle isn't explored at all. The plot devices the anime introduce to kickstart an event are quickly forgotten. And, in the end, nothing happens. It is extremely predictable from the very start and not engaging. However, for an anime that is entirely character-driven, plot shortcomings aren't as important as in other shows.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe story follows a group of 5 teenagers. Starting from the worst, we have Murao, a silent and self-centered girl that later is not like that, for some reasons hardly mentioned. She is bland and uninteresting, but is a main piece of the second love triangle, as Kominato has a crush on her, and she has a crush on Kou's brother, Tanaka-sensei. Kominato himself is just a friendly and energetic guy, nothing else to say about him, he's not relevant at all. Yuuri is a shy but sweet girl who is a piece of the main love triangle, but it feels like she is just a plot device thrown in to escalate the plot. She has some sort of characterization and personality though, so she's not a bad character per se, but really underwhelming going against the main duo. Tanaka-sensei, Kou's brother, is an important character in Kou's personal drama and life and manages to have some good characterization in relatively short screen time.\\n\\n\r\nAnd here we have our main duo, with the main protagonist Futaba going first. Futaba is a rather curious and gentle girl who has a crush on Kou but starts questioning her feelings after meeting him, after she got supposedly dumped by him several years ago, and circles around Kou to find out more about his changed personality. Futaba is not a great character by herself, as she is rather simple and two dimensional at most, but the best part about her is that she makes some great character interactions with Kou and the rest of the squad. There's nothing special about her, but she is the one that moves the story forward entirely by herself.\\n\\n\r\nKou is the best character in the series, surprisingly because he acts as a pseudo-plot device for Futaba. His personal drama and personality change is done very, very well and is the biggest highlight of the show. He has an \"I don't care\" mentality and acts like a typical jerk, but for some reason the group constantly tries to get along with him instead of leaving him alone. His story was predictable, but executed well after all, and is the only part of the show that didn't come off as bland and boring. (like the rest of the show)\\n\\n\r\nFor a character driven show, only two characters are relevant to the story at all. And that is really bad. At first you would have some sort of hope that you get to see a lot of interesting character interactions and different approaches to romance from different characters and how they react and develop from it but in reality, once you get familiar with the characters (around half of the show), all of them, except for Futaba and Kou (and plot device Yuuri) become completely irrelevant. And that is not how an anime should treat its cast. There was a limit to how much Kou and his story could have carried the rest of the show, and he alone couldn't quite reach the top.\\n\\n\r\nWriting:\\n\\n\r\nFor the comedy, it is simple reactional stuff over and over again. Something happens, characters react and you are supposed to laugh. Basic, but it actually works better here than other shows since you have some sort of attachment to characters and most of the comedy comes from at times funny interactions between Futaba and Kou. There's no fanservice to keep you interested, and although it doesn't ruin the narrative by being there, which is a good thing, the show actually got boring mid-way through so I don't know, maybe they should have had that? There's not so much slice of life to talk about, but Futaba's wish to not be labeled as an outcast once she experiences that in middle school is done quite decently and worth mentioning (along with Yuuri's situation, although she is just ruined later on)\\n\\n\r\nThere aren't any obvious writing mistakes, apart from the extreme overuse of wind in dramatic  or tense situations, but I would like to mention that the show rather quickly and completely forgets a rather interesting plot device in \"making the main cast the class representatives\" which could have sparked some more interesting situations to happen. The anime didn't use the potential of some of the introduced elements and instead went along with the most generic and uninspiring way possible - a completely vanilla romance with no backdrops or anything else for you to care about. Didn't like the romance? Tough luck, there's nothing else for you here.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Sound:\\n\\n\r\nThere's nothing so much to talk about the animation, the art looks good but the chibi-looking face expressions were sometimes unnecessary and distracting, and made the show's comedy look like trying too hard.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is worth mentioning as having a few emotional pieces and rather well timed songs. It is easily the best technical aspect of the show, and you should look forward to the official soundtrack release. Another mention is Yuki Kaji in his role of Kou, which was executed outstandingly. I rather have him voicing these kind of characters rather than screamy kids (Eren, Satomi), cause here he can unfold his full potential.\\n\\n\r\nSummary:\\n\\n\r\nAo Haru Ride is just an extremely cliched and generic title. The execution is decent, however it could have been better, but there are just no other hooks or interesting elements or setting to keep you interested, and it gets boring half-way through unless you absolutely love the characters. Not everyone's the same though. If you like Shoujo romances, then it's definitely a watch. It is not a bad show, but it is not a good one either. It is right down the middle, and that's why it deserves the rating it gets.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict - 5.3/10\\n\\n",

            "content": "Ao Haru Ride (Blue Spring Ride) in the best sense can describe itself as a shoujo. The concept of a childhood girl developing a crush towards a boy is something that has been done over and over before. It also has a sense of innocence as the young Futaba Yoshioka sees boys as \u2018violent\u2019. The only exception is a boy named Kou Tanaka who she sees as gentle. The problem is that a simple misunderstanding leads to a separation between the two as Tanaka transfer from school. Simply put, the experiences that Futaba shared with Tanaka is a treasure. But that treasure right now isburied away until one day\u2026.\\n\\n\r\nBased off the manga of the same name created by Io Sakisaka, the series depicts a show that hits shoujo at its very core. Recognized perhaps for her character designs from the recent movie (HAL) and the manga Strobe Edge, Ao Haru Ride also stands out on its own in a variety of ways. It takes one of the most classic genres and steers it into a direction with honesty, drama, and a show full of charm. The time for Spring is one of those seasons when youth blooms. Ao Haru Ride follows a group of characters that becomes interconnected in a story of young love and growing up.\\n\\n\r\nThe story revolves a group of characters during their school days. It\u2019s easy to say that school is a setting for people to grow up and perhaps change themselves. Futaba tries to do exactly that as she makes effort to be less girly. Her actions speaks louder than words too such as when she purposely eats more than appears to be to play down her girly side. The friends she has made essentially can also be seen as the tough crowd as they ostracizes her later on. Nonetheless, Futaba is a genuine kind girl as shown through her relationship with Yuuri, a pretty classmate who is despised by other girls. Other characters joining the story includes the lone wolf Shuuko Murao and the energetic Aya Kominato. Most importantly, Kou returns but now goes by the name \u201cKou Mabuchi\u201d. This isn\u2019t the only change though. Unlike his gentle self, the new Kou makes a 180 degree personality change with his sarcastic behavior and cold gestures. Really, you\u2019re probably asking yourself what in the world happened, right?\\n\\n\r\nParts that can make you engaged to the characters is the diversity. Almost every character has a different personality yet they all become part of the story that gets interconnected in some way. A short arc during the show also gets the main characters together to on a camping trip where they must collectively work together to succeed. It takes on development routes as circumstances are bought up between characters as they grow closer. Examples include Kou and Yuuri where the latter seems to feel more towards him than just a friend. Similarly, Shuuko also begins to open up more after confessing her own interests. Regardless, the show connects relationships in a realistic way that can be relatable. Ever wondered how love ever blooms between certain people? Ao Haru Ride pushes the buttons between the characters to both show and tell exactly just that.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the most prominent relationship throughout the show is between Kou and Futaba. After all, there\u2019s so much contrast in their characters that a seemingly meaningful relationship between the two just seems to be impossible. There\u2019s a lot of teasing and sarcasm between the duo despite an obvious mutual attraction. Jealousy is also an easy feeling that both characters feel throughout the show during various scenarios. But for what\u2019s worth, their relationship will spark a curious interest. The \u201cwill they or won\u2019t they?\u201d will be one of those questions viewers will ask themselves a lot of the time. Their story stabs in the heart at times when moments are broken by misunderstandings or interruptions. Nonetheless, the show has grace and spirit and isn\u2019t afraid to pull out moments that draws them closer together. On the other hand, Kou\u2019s actions often contrasts what he says. In essence, he is one of those guys that isn\u2019t being entirely honest with himself and struggles to be closer with others. This stark contrast to his childhood self is an interesting insight to see as Futaba tries to remember their times together. Speaking of which, Futaba\u2019s feelings also resurfaces as she gets to know the current Kou. While his personality as a friend has changed, she recognizes that he is still the same person she comes to love. With a depth of flashbacks, it\u2019s easy to see how these two can connect together despite being so very different.\\n\\n\r\nNo relationship can be without misunderstandings and love triangles. Ao Haru Ride doesn\u2019t break far from that as it follows the clich\u00e9. The catch is that Futaba doesn\u2019t wish to hurt others despite of her own feelings. A part of the story depicts her inner struggles to tell a friend about what she feels towards the boy. And if you guess right, that friend also shares the same feelings as the boy he fell for. Awkward moments must be accepted for enjoyment or this show will haunt you like a ticking time bomb. Luckily the show doesn\u2019t play on a viewer\u2019s patience too much. Even when it gets a bit intimidating, the show still is able to manage by with its clever humor and dramatic dialogues. They are often lighthearted with no shock value or profane scenarios. The slight problem sometimes though is the way it tries, especially with its dialogues during conversations. While the drama can get emotional and feel realistic, it has empty thrills and predictable outcomes. Furthermore, there\u2019s little you can feel at times because of the stereotypes. And because Kou and Futaba are the main focus, there\u2019s an obvious lack of characterization on the other characters. We don\u2019t find out too much about other characters besides who they are on the surface and their personalities. In retrospect, they feel less conventional as the love triangle is more of a plot device to draw Kou and Futaba closer together. The collateral damage is the one that\u2019s hurt as they become a cannon fodder; without the actual injury of course.\\n\\n\r\nBesides romance, friendship and family values is also explored. The main girl trio (Futaba, Yuuri, Murao) often interacts in ways that girls should be like. The key difference is that Futaba\u2019s new friends treats her with actual sincerity. I think it\u2019s appreciable to see how they connect with different interests. They also open up with honesty and help each other out when help is needed the most. On the other hand, there is also some family connection between Kou and his brother Yoichi Tanaka. This isn\u2019t much explored in depth but does show that the two shares a connection despite their different personalities.  Just realize that it can be dull and the awkward meetings often feels static with little interest. Luckily, this is brightened up by the humor of the show. Playing as a class clown of sorts, Aya Kominato often brightens up the series with his ebullience. A noticeable factor about him is the fact that he doesn\u2019t have much social issues unlike many of the others. His obvious crush on Murao is often seen as a comedy relief as the latter pays little attention to his advances. While this seems amusing, the problematic development between the duo is almost non-existent. Again, the main focus of the show is Futaba and Kou so don\u2019t expect much depth on the others; at least not on the same level as those two childhood birds.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork maintains a youthful appearance throughout the series. The background centralizes on the theme of Spring with the graceful weather, palate framework, and simple yet convincing imagery. The outdoors and weather has distinctiveness with its consistency. Flashbacks are cleverly decorated with aura-like water paint to illustrate youth. However, character designs are moderate. Most characters look stiff and movements are limited. There\u2019s less much focus on how the characters look but rather than the moments they capture. Important scenes have longer focus with a cool down time before a transition. I think the purpose for this is to create new memories and show how characters make of them during those short yet meaningful moments. But nonetheless, studio Production I.G. brings its top notch A-game when it comes to overall animation adaptation.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack is surprisingly strong even for a shoujo series such as this. Both the OP and ED songs have colorful imagery and symbolism. The OP song possesses both energy and a girly-like feeling while the ED song depicts more of a montage. OST is well-timed during key moments to bring out the best message of what they are motivated to do. Certain background songs are also played that further heightens memorable moments. This usually applies to scenes when characters\u2019 connections seems to be at their closest almost if they are in their own little world. Character voice mannerism also deserves praise as well as we see a sharp contrast between the former Kou Tanaka and Kou Machibi. Shuuko is also noticeable for her cold mannerism as a lone wolf but slowly adapts to a more sincere girl through her change. On the other hand, Futaba\u2019s voice can be irritating to listen at times with her stereotype.\\n\\n\r\nFor a shoujo series, Ao Haru Ride is surprisingly well structured based on its story. It has the look and feel of what a shoujo series should be with its characters, visuals, and other commonly seen tropes. While the show doesn\u2019t characterize everyone at the same level, it\u2019s interesting to see how their lives become interconnected through one and another. And through that, relationship are developed that can be everlasting. The show also does well with its realism and wastes little time to flesh out what it\u2019s trying to do with the premise. Indeed, the show doesn\u2019t stride far from where it begins as we see the relationship development between Futaba and Kou. An issue might arise that makes the audience ask themselves \u2018was that it?\u2019 or when the story feels repetitive. Still, with what it has offered up in its sleeves, I can say that Ao Haru Ride is definitely a ride worth taking.\\n",

            "content": "\"If you lose something, just build it again.\" - direct quote from the main character Futaba.\r\nFirst off let me just say that the fact that I've read the manga already mildly hinders my ability to separate manga from anime...\r\nMILDY.\r\nSTORY:\r\nThe story is pretty well done. Of course it has ALL of the shoujo clique's that many shoujo fans will run into.\r\nThere's something about the story though that makes it a little more unique than your typical shoujo anime.\r\nI did not really sense any corny-ness with the more serious moments in the anime as I would typical feel in a shoujo.\r\nWhat I'm trying to say it that,it felt real.\\n\r\nThe situations felt pretty realistic to me & not so unimaginable or silly.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\r\nYour basic animation and art style for an Anime.\\n\r\nOf course not all art looks the same but the overall gist of it is your basic anime-shoujo style.\\n\r\nI bumped it up to an 8 because they changed the art to a very oil pastel look for the backgrounds when they would show a flashback. I found that pastel look to be very enjoyable & more interesting than making the flashback fuzzy/blurry.\\n\r\nBottom line, the Art is cute. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nAt first the opening/ending/BG music was too cute for me.\\n\r\nYou know that point of cute where it's almost obnoxious?\\n\r\nThat's how it felt for me...AT FIRST.\\n\r\nBut you get to know the characters and story-line more as you watch & you start to notice how WELL the sound really fits the anime.\\n\r\nAs serious as it gets sometimes...that's not the theme or message.\\n\r\nIt's lighthearted. It's fun.\\n\r\nAnd the opening is very fitting. The bouncing up & down beat sets up the story because it shows how up & down the characters situations are.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER(s):\\n\r\nStreaming off from the SOUND comment,\\n\r\nthe characters are all just trying to make the best of the situation and the opening represents that really well.\\n\\n\r\nHere's a bit of a warning...\\n\r\nI do not think you will like every part of any one of the characters.\\n\r\nLike books, characters are not always meant to be relatable or liked.\\n\r\nAll of the characters CAN be likable IF you accept the side of them that is NOT likable.\\n\r\nThat's what the anime is about.\\n\r\nYou can have all the unlikable traits you want but if you just (stemming off from what the Anime will eventually show what the characters want...) \"open up your heart\", you WILL be accepted.\\n\r\nCorny thought? Yes.\\n\r\nBut this is the best way I can explain the characters.\\n\\n\r\nHad to give a 7 though because all were very predictable characters.\\n\r\nNothing new.\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\r\nI said above that I read the manga. The manga is AMAZING. As with any manga-to-anime adaption, the manga is always best.\\n\r\nDetails.\\n\r\nA cleaner set-up to situations.\\n\r\nBetter understanding of characters. (Although the Anime did throw in some really good quotes/one-liners!)\\n\\n\r\nHOWEVER, I still enjoyed the Anime.\\n\r\nI enjoyed actually watching how the characters move. How they interact. Grow. The funny faces/body language they would make.\\n\r\nVery enjoyable...if you have patience.\\n\r\nIf you're tired of that stoic shoujo boy then you shouldn't watch this because I doubt you'd be able to stomach how stoic the boy is at first.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nI found the Anime to be well made.\\n\r\nIt was a decent adaptation from the manga. Included A LOT of major & key things as well as set it up for....wait for it...\\n\r\nTHE NEXT SEASON.\\n\r\nHint hint to non-manga readers, that person we briefly get introduced to in the end is going to be an important person in the next season.\\n\r\nIf it gets renewed for the next season. *fingers crossed*\\n\\n\r\nI'm telling you guys...the things that happen WILL make you keep watching :)\\n",

            "content": "I have not read the source material for the show and the following review is for the anime adaption only, the manga, LN or other source material is not included in my review of this anime.\r\nAo Haru Ride is a character driven romance between the two main characters Kou and Futaba. The show kicks off when Futaba recognizes Kou at her high school and goes on from there.\r\nStory\r\nI pretty much already went over the basic premise but, it's also important to know that Kou and Futaba knew each other in middle school. The premise itself is kind of generic which isn't entirely bad. I likedhow the two main characters had met in the past and, now Kou was entirely different for reasons unknown to Futaba and the viewers. It was a good way to hook people.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the art of the show. It was colorful and, the character designs fit the settings and, the characters themselves. The art is distinguishable from other series but isn't anything unique or all that interesting.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nThe show had a good OP and ED. The music during the show was appropriate and, sounded nice. Also, there was some good voice acting for the characters, especially Kou.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nSadly, most of the characters in Ao Haru Ride aren't all that great. The characters I didn't like were Yuuri, Kominato, Murao and Kou. \\n\\n\r\nIn the case of Kominato and Murao, they didn't add anything to the story. The show would have been the same if they weren't there. So why were they in the story, I don't know? In addition to not having a point, they aren't particularly interesting and, the viewer isn't really given a reason to care for them.\\n\\n\r\nYuuri is the second member of the Kou fan club and, the third member of the show's love triangle. The problem with her is that again, she doesn't do anything for the story, it would have been the same if she was removed from the show. All she does after befriending Futaba is obsess over a CD she borrowed from Kou. The fact that she and, Futaba both love Kou is supposed to be a source of conflict for herself and Futaba but, it doesn't really cause any issues in their relationship. Her love for Kou doesn't cause any conflict for the two main characters Kou and Futaba. Why I didn't include her with the other two pointless side characters is because Yuuri is supposed to have a purpose. She is supposed to be a part of the story. She is supposed to cause conflicts between the two main characters and, have conflicts with them but, she fails at all of the points I listed. \\n\\n\r\nKou starts off as an interesting character. The viewer is after all supposed to be drawn into the show by his mysterious change from being kind and, quiet to cold and, \"too cool to care\". My problem with Kou isn't that he can be an annoying, angsty teenager. My problem is that he isn't a consistent character. Somewhere around episode 7 or 8 all of his progression just disappears until the final episode. It feels really unnatural and, forced for the sake of the \"story\" which is finding out why Kou is different then he was before. \\n\\n\r\nAo Haru Ride forces this unnatural character reset by having Yuuri and, Futaba pursue Kou before they find anything out about him. If the writers would have put the revelations about Kou's past at the start of the show and, then had Futaba and Yuuri try to get with him everything would have made more sense and, Kou wouldn't have had to have a forced character reset.\\n\\n\r\nFutaba, and Kou's brother are the only other relevant characters in the show. They are both members of the Kou fan club and, I didn't have any particular problems with either of them. That being said they aren't really all that great of characters either since the only thing about them that matters is how they feel about Kou.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the beginning of the show. It may have been a generic premise but, it was well executed. I wanted to know more about the characters and, was interested to see how the show would progress. However, the addition of the side characters, love triangle and, after Kou's character reset, Ao Haru Ride just wasn't all that interesting or, something I really cared about anymore. One scene that left a terrible impression with me was when Kou told Futaba that he could sexually assault her if he wanted to after climbing on top of her. I just felt that it was unnecessary and, in bad taste.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nI gave Ao Haru Ride a 4/10. It has good art and music but neither of these elements overcome the pit falls of the show. The biggest problem of the show is that it forces character \"resets\" for the sake of the story. Another problem is that the side characters don't do anything to warrant their inclusion in the show. For reference the most useful side character is Kou's brother whose only job is to feed Futaba information about Kou and, his back story. Finally, I really hated the creepy sexual assault scene.\\n\\n\r\n***DISCLAIMER*** I have not read the source material for the show and the review is for the anime adaption only. The manga, light novel or other source material is not included in my review of this anime.\\n",

            "content": "**I have only seen the anime of Ao Haru Ride and this review is only based on that.\r\nSo as a person who rarely watches Shoujo anime this was a first for me, so keep that in mind. \r\nAo Haru Ride/Blue Spring Ride/\u30a2\u30aa\u30cf\u30e9\u30a4\u30c9 ; 12 episode a 20minutes, aired from July to September 2014; Comedy, Drama, SoL, Romance, Shoujo, School; licensed by Sentai Filmworks\r\nAo Haru Ride starts with a premise that seems typical for this type of anime - a slice of life show that wants to show the development of a romance and of the characters. The story is set in high school and focusesaround a small group of teenagers. Mostentimes, these kind of animes are made by the nuances, the art and the soundtrack since the story is mostly very linear, predictable or repetitive. This is partly the case here aswell.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\r\nLike I already mentioned, the storyline of this type of anime are very linear and predictable, and this is also the case here. It could honestly be worse, but I wouldn't call it an extremely sophisticated and good story. But it surely isnt bad. It revolves around the classical trope of re-meeting a past lover in your 2nd life/later life, and this is also the case here. Futaba meets Kou again after they spent a term in middle school together and fell in love. However, both of them changed, but the feelings obviously remain. The anime does a good job in focusing around their relationship and its development as they get to know each other and learn what happened in the time they missed. Sadly some interesting side characters are a bit left out in the story development - Murao, Kominato - but its only natural for the plotline.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nI dont know too much about the producing studios so I cant tell much about their reputation/part in the production of the art, but it sure is good. In the beginning, I thought some parts of it were strange, but in the end I was fully captured by the beautiful color selection and the well-animated motion scenes. I gave it a 10 because it felt like the art was very much perfect for the vibe the story had created. You will not be disappointed by the art thats for sure.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nI'm not a particular fan of the japanese music nor of anime music, so normally I dont give particularly good ratings for the sound. However the OP and ED were both very fitting and enjoyable, and the music choice in the series also just perfect for the situation. Funny fast music for comedic sccenes, slow and monotone for dialogues and thinking and enjoyable and vivid for love and happiness scenes. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nWhile I think the characters are all extremely realistic and well-portrayed, the predictability and the underdevelopment of very interesting characters steals quite some points here. Others may disagree, but oftentimes a shift of focus onto the supporting characters, especially in the later part of the series, would have helped a lot to show the progression of the group of friends. But the two main characters are explained and focused very deeply which adds more spice and sense to the storyline, which is a really good thing (uff phrasing). \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nI personally would call this an \"anime oozing with love, cuteness and understanding\" but that wouldnt exactly be true. However, its the part which made the series so good for me: just a lot of romance coupled with the problems of everyday life and battling with depression. The mutual help the two mains give each other to overcome their problems is portrayed in such a good and convincing way, the romance was just bound to come. It all felt very realistic and the extremely good portrayal of such deserved to get a 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nShortly said: The predictability and linear part of the storyline was largely compensated by the amazing art and the well-thought character development. Depening on your personal feelings and attitudes, you will enjoy this anime or enjoy it a lot - its open to you. I would suggest everyone who likes romance and school SoL animes to watch this show, its really good.\\n\\n\r\nForecast: I won't read the manga, but what I heard and read about it it seems to be really good and clearly adds a deeper thought and process to the relationship between Kou and Futaba. To my knowledge it has already ended or atleast it will this spring, but I'm not entirely sure. Also I predict that this anime will get a 2nd season - the ending of the first clearly leaves a lot of room for story improvement.\\n\\n\r\n**This is my first review, nor is english my native language so bear with me. If you have any feedback PLEASE tell me so I can improve. I will write a review for every anime show I watch from now on, so I do want to write good quality reviews. Thanks for your reading!",

What makes it unique, however, is that the conflict is softly given focus throughout the series, causing viewers to feel unanticipated emotions in the culmination of the story wherein the characters reveal their hidden sides (weaknesses and strengths included) and emotional baggage. \r\nI highly recommend this anime to individuals who are looking for a warm and charming anime that will enkindle thrill, sorrow andfeelings of hopefulness.",

            "content": "My review is only 2 words:\r\nShoujo Oregairu\r\nBut MAL isn't letting me make such a short review so the rest is padding and a general view of the usage of cinematography in Anime.\r\nWhat primarily makes animation different from film is the complete creative control over the medium. This means that what previously had to be sought out in small spaces of reality, the perfect shot, the perfect actions, the perfect outplay of emotions, can now be rectified to the minute-test detail. Tarkovsky, the famous Russian film director, had to reconstruct his family home from scratch in the middle of a beautiful plot of Russian field andforest during the filming of The Mirror. In The Sacrifice he had to pull off a 7 minute long shot of a burning house which he couldn't re-do due to the lack of budget to rebuild the house. This doesn't have to be done in animation. In theory one could do away with editing altogether and have seamless flowing animation. The only film I know that uses a single shot for the whole film is Russian Ark. Animation doesn't need the vast set required to film like that, it can simply metamorphosize one shot into another.\\n\\n\r\nYet of course budget concerns force animators to still edit in shots. We need our premade backgrounds to cut corners. If Shinkai had made a 5cm Per Second where everything moved as vibrant as life itself besides being romantically beautiful the project probably would have crashed and burned. Some animators carry over their techniques from cinema to animation. Hideaki Anno's training in live film can be seen in the way he perfects atmosphere through his isolated shots, not just for action to action transitions. Shinbo is able to maximize the power of editing by using lightning fast montages to convey speed to his works.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation also allows the control of colour palette and complete composition. Ao Haru Ride uses the pastelly color palette of traditional shojo to lighten the mood while White Album 2 (which I watched at the same time) carries over its Visual Novel influence by giving everything a Shinkai-ish gleam and use high lightning contrasts and chiaroscuro in its most beautiful red evening shots. Shinbo's minimalism stands out on its own and the peak of oneiric animation is seen through his collaboration of Gekidan Inu Curry for Madoka Magica.\\n\\n\r\nIn animation everything can move and every dream is true. The European animation The Illusionist is an example of complete generosity. Every shot is cluttered with activity and jokes, following the comedic film-philosophy of Jacques Tati. One could say that the main philosophical thrust of animation should be Panta Rei. It should reflect the dreaming river of the world.\\n\\n\r\nThe greatest sin of animation is a lack of imagination and movement. Movies can get off being slow and dictated by a stonish reality. Books can get off being prosaic and preachy. If you want to be preachy in animation the world must move with your words. That's why Bakemonogatari works. Animation is the bastion to save one from the horror vacui. It is Borges' Total Library or the world of Tlon. Miyazaki acknowledged that the primary drive of animation was dreams. People must not forget that its a medium where anything is possible.\\n\\n\r\nStill if we let everything BE possible we would find ourselves in a bloated stew. Even the variety of Spirited Away has an ordering principle behind the shots and reveals. The world of limitless imagination is a monster that eats away at logic and sanity. Evangelion is a documentation of that edge, much like how Artaud's poetry was in the past.\\n\\n\r\nOur ambition is to have a medium that contains everything, our songs, our dreams, our nightmares, our depths and our surfaces. We should, when dealing with animation, have a voracious greed to expand this illusory world with experiences, and in doing so paradoxically expand the reaches of the real as well.",

            "content": "I wanted to watch Ao Haru Ride just because it's shoujo, and I really like shoujo. I put my hopes up high with this anime. I heard GREAT things about the manga and so I expected the anime to be as fascinating. What I found was good but not as good as I wished.\r\nStory: 7.\r\nIt was... typical. Very, very typical. Girl and Boy are in love since years ago. Girl still is. Boy says he's not. Another Girl falls in love with Boy. Girl and Another Girl are best friends. That's cool, I'm not saying it's not, but it's not surprising anyone. Does Boy actuallylove Girl? Well, read the manga.\\n\r\nAlso, story develops slowly which is good. You see how five friends start to like each other and end up thinking of a future together. There are cracks in the way but they do care about their friendship. \\n\r\nHowever, I wish we had more about Murao and Tanaka's storyline. I can't explain why, but I found their story more appealing than Futaba-Mabuchi's.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8.\\n\r\nAnimation was really good. Scenes were colorful, bright and just nice to watch. Sometimes the design of characters seemed rushed but close-ups were amazing. Also, pastel colors in flashbacks were A+.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9.\\n\r\nIt's weird for me to say this because I usually never pay attention to soundtrack in anime, but I enjoyed it so, so much. The soudntrack just FITS and the opening is catchy and cute. I can't explain it any better.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6.\\n\r\nI guess I was... kinda disappointed. At first I thought Mabuchi was an asshole. He doesn't feel comfortable enough to get out of the shell till the end. He's misterious, quiet. He has this dark vibe around him that many may find attractive. Well, I have to say that I didn't and still don't.\\n\r\nFutaba reminded me of Misaki (from Kaich\u014d wa Maid-sama!) and Risa (from Lovely Complex), characters who I adore. Futaba, however, pretends to be unladylike just to fit while Misaki and Risa actually are like that. It was interesting to see how she and Mabuchi develop in their true self towards the end.\\n\r\nYuuri was too cute for me, to the point that it was kinda irritating. On the other hand, we have her opposite, Murao, who I liked a lot.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7.\\n\r\nIt was good. I mean, not amazing, but it was good. It'll probably warm your heart but you won't think of Ao Haru Ride the morning after you finish the anime. At least, I didn't.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.\\n\r\nIf I was 16 years old, I would have enjoyed this story a lot more than I did. I guess I'm getting old because I found the whole anime kind of childish (honestly I don't even know what I was expecting, they're in high school). It was still good tho.\\n\r\nWhat I found interesting is that this anime kinda teachs you to be true to yourself. At first, you find that everyone is who they want to be- but who they want to be is not who they really are.\\n",

            "content": "This is my first review on MAL so excuse me if it's sorta bad d:\r\nI'll be quite honest, I'm usually only really big on anime with magic, action, with comedy and possibly some romance all thrown in. This anime appears to just basically be your usual school/romance anime, but it's so much more than that. I can say for sure that Ao Haru Ride has become my favorite romance anime (not including comedy/romance) there was comedy thrown in but i look at this as a romance, not a comedy. \r\nThe story is very basic and isn't totally outstanding but it's the characters themselves that gotme hooked. The art is very unique and wonderful (Production I.G. is personally my favorite studio and always seems to do a fantastic job). I absolutely loved this anime and had so much fun watching it, it's  a romance but it can be so intense at some points as if you were watching a fight scene in Attack On Titan. It had me cheering, upset, happy, excited, just everything. Whenever Kou and Futaba were together  I just got so excited and interested. \\n\\n\r\nLike I mentioned earlier, the story and overall plot itself isn't that unique or outstanding but the backstory behind Kou is where the story really shines and shows how Kou has became sorta the heartless person he is today. \\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend watching this anime even if you aren't too into the whole romance thing. I had so much fun watching this and it even had me jumping out of my seat at one point or another O.O There are very few romance anime that I can say i actually thoroughly enjoyed, but this tops them all. And if you do like romance anime, why haven't you watched this yet? Get to it!",

            "content": "A white shirt. That's what Ao Haru Ride reminds me of.\r\nAs more and more shoujo, school-life animes with all the romance and complications that come with it are released; people are starting to see the typical pattern of the girl meets boy or vice versa. Ao Haru Ride follows this pattern which is present in most popular shoujo/school/romance animes; however this does not mean it isn\u2019t worth your time.\r\nI gave the story a 7 (Good), for the sole reason of the anime exploring the changes that occurs in one\u2019s life when they push themselves out of their comfort zones. The anime encourages young individuals tofully experience their youths and to never hesitate on their decisions which can positively affect their life. It also shows the importance of expressing a person\u2019s individuality, especially in the society we live in now, where there are many pressures to change one-self, for the benefit of others.  The 3 points lost was due to the fact that the story, romance-wise, follows a common pattern, mentioned above in the previous paragraph.\\n\\n\r\n9 (Great) for the artstyle. The high points given were due to the expression of character as well as their situation and ambient feel. Ao haru ride uses common, yet effective ways to communicate the characters emotions and their environment to the audience. \\n\\n\r\nSound was also given a 9 because of how effective it communicates the character\u2019s emotions to the audience.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe charactersation of the characters in Ao Haru Ride accurately reflects the attitudes of most people who are in high school, that\u2019s why it got a 10 (outstanding). The main heroine protagonist Yoshioka Futaba is always putting up a fa\u00e7ade in order to blend in with the crowd. The anime really excels at showing the progress as well as the few stuff ups she\u2019s made to change her life throughout the series, and it shows that every little thing you do counts. The main male protagonist, Mabuchi Kou is complicated. He was initially a shy-boy during his junior highschool years, however his personality changed due to the events mentioned in the series. His attitude towards school is nonchalant, yet he always pushes the heroine to a better path whenever she strays from it. He is kind, but also distant. The other characters like Murao Shuuko and Makita Yuuri  also are very realistic and interesting characters. Particularly Makita Yuuri, who, unlike the heroine, did not decide to put a fa\u00e7ade in order to fit in at school. Therefore, the combination of realistic and interesting characters which makes up Ao Haru Ride has given it a 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment throughout watching the whole series was 7 (Good). This is because I have personally watched many shoujo-romance animes which is reminiscent of this one, which takes away the excitement from knowing the outcomes of character decisions as well as situations. However, if you are still new to the shoujo-romance-highschool   genre, this is definitely worth a try.\\n\\n\r\nThe overall score is 8. The main positives which contributed to the high score were the Art, Sound and the Characters. However the fairly common patterns in romance-shoujo animes are present in Ao Haru Ride, making it a pretty flat series. Despite this, like a white shirt, Ao Haru Ride, is simple, effective and suits every situation. It\u2019s best for all ages, although younger audiences might gain more wisdom from the moral of the series as well as the characterisation.\\n",

            "content": "After a long time debating whether or not I should watch this short anime I decided to give it a shot\r\nStory 8/10\r\nIt starts off sweet, 2 people who loved each other in middle school finally reunited, but the problem is that they have both changed and don\u2019t love each other the way they are now. There\u2019s plenty of things to keep you interested in this anime especially if you like romance, comedy and school based anime\u2019s. The plot may seem to drag on a little at times but isn\u2019t too bad once you get into it. One thing that I hated about the plot wasthe love triangle that was added. It just seemed unnecessary and how quickly Futaba\u2019s friend fell for Kou despite hardly knowing him while the protagonist has known him longer. Despite that the anime was enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\nI enjoyed the art style of this anime, it looked polished and done well.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\r\nThe music was surprisingly good and fit with the story well. The opening has nice art and a good song. The voice acting is good and nice to hear.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 7/10\\n\r\nThe main characters Futaba and Kou are interesting and have interesting personalities. They show there love without talking about it and in their own way without letting the other find out. Although Kou was annoying some of the time, well I guess he had a lot of growing up to do. At times I wish he would be more serious and care about stuff as he was in the past.  The other side characters are kind of realistic, a girl who secretly loves her sensei and didn\u2019t have friends before, the other is a shy girl whose behaviour resembles what Futaba\u2019s was like during middle school.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10\\n\r\nI enjoyed watching this as I enjoy love stories and shoujo here and there.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\r\nI recommend this anime \\n",

            "content": "Plot: 7/10\r\n Summary: Ao Haru Ride takes place in your typical Japanese high school like many other animes of its genre. Overall it centers over main character Futaba who is in her second year of high school. It begins with immediate flashbacks to middle school where she meets the sweet Kou Tanaka. The two begin to get close making it obvious that a romantic relationship could start. But because of her classmates' rude comments regarding how appealing Futaba is to guys, she begins to feel insecure. They say that because she is so appealing to the boys in school, girls don't want to be herfriend. So in attempt to shed the image of being the \"cute girl\" she makes the loud statement that she doesn't like guys, AT ALL. Of course Kou overhears this without ever knowing her true feelings. Fast forward to Futaba's second year of high school and she is now popular with more female friends even though they may be fake at times. She achieves this through trying to act more masculine. Meanwhile, Kou has moved away and lives elsewhere in Japan. When he moves back Futaba has to deal with the drama that surrounds his return. \\n\r\nI give the plot of this show a 7/10 because it tends to be generic and follows a lot of the typical anime tropes. There's a lot of back and forth and wishy-washyness throughout which can get a bit annoying at times. The reason I give this a higher score is because the emotional aspects of it make you want to stay with the plot and root for the main characters. The worst thing about this anime in my opinion is that it ends way too abruptly. Being only 12 episodes long, you can expect them to have a hard time telling the whole story in great detail without skipping a lot of things. Having read the manga, this anime ends before the real meat and potatoes of the story even begins. There's a couple of characters that we don't even meet in the anime. It's the kind of anime that leaves you wanting to read the manga. If you like the anime I definitely recommend reading the manga to get even more of this sweet story.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 7/10\\n\r\nI would give the characters a 10/10 if it wasn't for some of the annoyingness of the 2 main characters. Futaba is really sweet and means well but she can tend to be the typical shoujo ditz at times. Kou can also get super indecisive and lies about his true feelings which can get on your nerves at times. But at the end of the day all of the characters are pretty likeable. I also feel that they did an excellent job with characterization despite the short time frame. You really feel connected to all of the major characters and get into their story. There's always the wish to get into more backstories with certain people, but not even the manga delivers that. \\n\\n\r\nMusic 9/10 \\n\r\nMusic doesn't really play a huge part in this anime. But when it does, it really brings out the emotion. I wouldn't say it brought me to tears at any point, but it definitely ties together the scenes when it's used. The theme song is also nice and catchy. It will get stuck in your head!\\n\\n\r\nAnimation 9/10 \\n\r\nThe animation in this in my opinion is pretty strong. It has a lot of lighter colors and smooth edges. For such a short anime they took the time to make it look pretty darn good. It also sticks very close to the style of the manga. Like any anime it has it's moments where the animation looks a little wonky, but overall a job well done.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\r\nI give this anime and 8/10 because even with its generally generic plot and characters that can get a little tiresome at times, the anime brings emotion and a truly moving story. The animation is pretty spot on and if you enjoy the musical aspects of a show you will enjoy that as well. In addition if you like a good dramatic romance with a *SPOILER) happy ending, this anime is for you. And again, if you watch this a like it, I strongly recommend that you read the manga which is already finished. It will leave you wanting more.",

            "content": "It absolutely befuddles me how this anime managed to get a rating of almost 8. I had heard it was clich\u00e9d, but that it managed to have a fresh approach on those clich\u00e9s. I heard it was both funny and emotional. Nope. Not at all. This anime is the same old clich\u00e9s used over and over again. I find it almost insulting that multiple users recommended this for fans of \"Tonari-no Kaibutsu-kun\", a beautifully done anime which has essentially nothing in common with this anime, and has characters a million times better than those in \"Ao Haru Ride\".\r\nThis is one of those anime where theguy treats the girl like crap, yet she somehow ends up falling for him. This is one of those anime that says if a guy is hostile towards you, it just means he cares. This is one of those anime that says no matter how horrible a person is, if you love them enough, you can change them.\\n\\n\r\nHere is a list of some of the clich\u00e9s used in this anime. There are two girls that are just so pretty that the guys all love them and as a result the girls all hate them. Petty love triangles. Girl falls for a guy because he shows basic human decency. Girl falls for the guy even though he's a huge ass that emotionally, physically, and verbally abuses her. Overprotective love interest. Long lost love. Girl stalking the guy she likes. Other annoying crap.\\n\\n\r\nWas this why I stopped watching the anime? No, the reason is much simpler and much more disturbing than that. What is it, you ask? It's when Kou tells Futaba she could get hurt if she walked around alone at night. It's when she doesn't know what he's talking about, so he pins her to the ground and makes a move as though he's going to sexually assault her. It's when he basically says, \"I could rape you if I wanted to.\" It's the fact that this messed up scene is supposed to be viewed as him just caring for her, and her seeing that as a sign of affection and being totally okay with it. THAT is where I drew the line.\\n\\n\r\nSo if you're okay with clich\u00e9d anime that portray young women as being idiots who have a tendency to fall in love with jerks, guys who treat the girls they have feelings for like gum on the bottom of their shoes (because we all know that if a guy is terrible to you, it means he secretly likes you\u2014yeah, no; didn't believe it when my grandmother told me that about the bully I had in first grade, and I don't believe it now), stupid people, and guys who act like they're superior because they happen to have a Y chromosome, then go ahead. Watch the anime.",

            "content": "It's rare that I write a good review, but Ao Hara Ride deserves it.\r\nAo Haru Ride is a breath of fresh air in the cliche-ridden Shoujo genre, where i seems like half of shoujo anime are carbon copies of one another.\r\nAo Haru Ride offers something new, interesting, and touching, with relatable but unique characters, great development, an interesting plot and beautiful, unique art and music that tugs at your heart. \r\nThe main heroine is the usual happy, cheerful type, but she has extra layers that make her complex, interesting, and unique Futaba changed her appearance and attitude in order to fit in with her groupof friends- she eats a lot, wears no makeup, and makes her hair messy so she won't look cute, because in middle school she was bullied by jealous girls due to the attention she received from men. Who can't relate to this- this desire to change yourself in order to fit in? The desire to have friends so badly that you even believe there's something wrong with you, and you need to be different? \\n\r\nThe story also makes a strong - and again, relatable - point that the friends you make when you change yourself and act like someone you aren't to fit in, aren't real friends- real friends love and accept you for who you are. The scene where Futaba is alone and starts crying, and Kou hugs her so her old friends can't see she is crying, and he tells her those aren't her real friends- that is one of the most touching scenes in anime. \\n\r\nThe anime is full of touching scenes that resonate in your soul, leave you thinking and teary eyed yet smiling. \\n\r\nKou, for example, comes off as an arrogant, cheeky guy, but he's actually very sensitive, serious and closed off to the world. Futaba has to work to understand him, the pain he's been through, and we can all relate to Kou as well- who built up walls to keep people out, only to see who would care enough about him to break down those walls. His character's changes were also very realistic, and his pain was relatable - lots of people experience what he did and react similarly.  \\n\\n\r\nAo Haru Ride may look like just another sweet school romance anime, but it has so many touching themes and ideas. It touches on the importance, sweetness, and pain of relationships- both romantic, familiar, and friendship ones - and many other ideas that teenagers and everyone can relate to. It truly is wonderful, refreshing, and beautiful in every aspect. My only complaint was...I guess the animation could've been better?",

            "content": "*Contains spoilers*\r\nBefore you watch an anime, you occasionally check the tags it has got, so you know what to expect from it right? Well, you're wrong with this one.\r\nAo Haru Ride is supposed to be a romance anime, since the plot is mainly about two protagonists, who go through an inner development and come to the conclusion that they have feelings for another. Pretty basic romance plot.\r\nAo Haru Ride's plot is nothing outstanding, but it still manages to fascinate you at the beginning.\r\nThis anime, does a good job in showing how these characters grow throughout time, but completely ignores the fact, that the characters arebound to confess each others feelings sometime.\\n\r\nWhat it does, is to prolong this as long as possible, until the time is up and all you get to see is people looking back at memories of spending time together, while disregarding the feelings they still have for the other person.\\n\\n\r\nIf you don't expect a kiss shared by anyone in the anime, go right ahead and watch it. It'll be great for you.\\n\r\nWhen I read ROMANCE, I expect a passionate relationship between two people. A relationship being a situation, where you get intimate with each other, where the first step would be to share a kiss.\\n\\n\r\nFrom what I've seen in this anime, all of these people were FRIENDS. Not saying that they haven't shared powerful, life changing moments, but they still stay good friends and nothing more, even if the people clearly have feelings for someone.\\n\\n\r\nI've seen this in a lot of animes, where the writers simply decide to make a \"cliff hanger\", not revelaing anything, so they can develop a second season, which comes out years later, when everyone has forgotten about it.\\n\r\nThis is not how you keep your viewers interested. Giving them something \"real\", is what makes them say: \"wow. I really enjoyed this\".\\n\r\nRight now I feel like I've wasted my time watching it all the way to the end.\\n\\n\r\nTaking away the romance from a romance anime, would be like driving a car without fuel.\\n\\n\r\nBesides this main problem, the anime has a great art style and music. I enjoyed singing along to the soundtrack. I don't want to say, that I had a smile at the ending of every episode, but it has an relaxing, friendly atmosphere, which makes you want to come back for more.\\n\r\nThis is exactly why I feel bad writing this review. I really had high hopes for this anime, but it left me dssapointed, although it really had potential.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: If you are looking for an anime, that has nothing to offer regarding romance, this is perfect for you.\\n",

            "content": "Love is a lot of things. Especially for young people. Sometimes, love can make you a better person. Sometimes, being loved can make you evolve. Love changes people, for the better or the worse. Such is the simple premise of Ao Haru Ride (AHR). \r\nPlot\r\nThe story of AHR is a classic one. Yoshioka Futaba, a normal high school girl, meets her long lost middle school crush, Kou. Neither of the two have feelings for each other any longer, but upon meeting him again, Futaba falls in love.  The story is as simple as that, Futaba denying her love, yet chasing Kou all the same.This story is in no way original. But please, do not be fooled by the generic plot. Even without originality, AHR is classic shoujo at is best.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing of AHR is, in my opinion, amazing. Of all the shoujo I have seen and read, AHR by far has the most natural development. The story, being an unoriginal slice-of-life, has a clear disadvantage in its innate dullness. The only way to really fight this is development of the plot. The faster the pacing, the less boring, right? And while this is true, too fast pacing makes a plot seem rushed and incoherent. AHR manages to move forward at exactly the right pace. The development of the characters' relationships are at all time present in such a way that you really feel that they get closer to each other with each moment, each conversation. The development seems so natural that it reminds me of myself making new friends. While the story mainly relies on the characters,  small changes of setting (such as school trips, after school studying, etc.) are introduced regularly, moving the series farther from boring. The comedy as well is done at the right times, giving the series a comedic side, without spoiling the romance. All in all the dull core of the plot is handled very well and turned into a good story. \\n\\n\r\nTo round up about the pacing, I'd say that even the romance is well-paced. The development is smooth, more physical than you would usually see in shoujo - which is a good contrast to what is often seen in shoujo. \\n\\n\r\nAs  in usual shoujo the side stories of the supporting characters are very important. While the stories of these are as cliched as the main one, they serve their purpose of spicing the series up well enough. \\n\\n\r\nApart from the unoriginality there are few inconsistencies in the plot, such as, for one, why it took Futaba almost a year to notice that she was in the same school as Kou. \\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nWhile many people praise the art, I'd say it's good, but nothing amazing. The characters are, of course, extremely handsome in a cute, natural way. However, I wont give the anime much credit for that since the drawings in the manga are a lot better. The animated design of the characters is nice, but pretty medicore, considering the animation quality of this year. I'm honestly a bit disappointed that they didn't make better use of Sakisaka Io's beautiful style. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, the art is overall nice. The backgrounds are done with water colours, giving them an extra cute, innocent feelings that fits the story. The same can be said about the colours, them mainly being light and unsaturated. \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe sound is really one of the good point of the series. The opening and ending are well-fitting, the opening being upbeat yet cute, the ending a slow, emotional tune. The OSTs are bordering amazing. The main theme is  a cute tune, bordering melancholic with slow pacing and piano, really contributing to creating the right mood. Generally, the music is really well-used - funny tunes being played at the comedic moments, an embarrassing tune for the weirder moments. As a tip of the iceberg, they have incorporated an amazingly sad and heartwarming song (I will by Chelsy) for romantic moments, really reflecting their tragic love story. The song is widely praised, and not without reason, just as it is used perfectly in the series, sometimes playing instead of dialogue. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting of the series is quite good as well. How fitting the cast is can be discussed, but the actors do quite good jobs. Kou (Kaji Yuki) does a superb job. Personally, I didn't think he fitted the role, but by the end of the series he had me convinced. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThe one point where AHR really shines is the characters. I earlier said that the pacing was what saved the story from being boring and not worth a watch, while the pacing definitely contributes to making the series good, what really makes the story exciting, original even, are the characters. \\n\\n\r\nStarting with the main character, Futaba, who is really just our annoying, boyish, usual shoujo heroine - or? Indeed in the beginning of the series, Futaba has so many annoying traits that she almost isn't likable. She is pretending to be boyish to gain friends who are even more annoying and superficial than herself. It is not only a horrible story, it has also been seen before. However, the development she experiences when she meets Kou is immense. She goes from selfish and stupid to being a sweet girl, thinking more about others than herself. Futaba becomes everything a shoujo heroine needs to be - and more. \\n\\n\r\nThe supporting characters are unoriginal, but they serve their purpose. Yuuri is the cutest thing ever, which creates the drama a shoujo needs. Murao is mature and refined, Kominato cheerful and friendly. The one character I really like - and see as more original - is Tanaka-sensei. I really like his role in the story and bringing in a teacher definitely spices up things. The supporting characters created drama and plot and they ensure that everyone can find a character of their liking in the series.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now, last of all, I want to talk about Kou. Personally, I love Kou's indifferent, cold, cheeky character, and even though he might be unlikable to some, his rude character is explained throughout the story. Beneath all the layers of attitude, he is an emotional boy, haunted by his past.  While we see the story from Futaba's point of view, the one the story really revolves around is Kou. Kou is the deep, clever character that question the actions of others. Kou is the one with the interesting background story. While Futaba's personality change early in the story, the development of Kou happens gradually, his story unfolding a little at a time, his heart opening ever so slowly. It is Kou that will make you laugh, it is Kou that will make you cry. \\n\\n\r\nAo Haru Ride is, in truth, an anime about Kou's development. An anime about how love can hurt you, change you, and how being loved a new may enable you to change again. \\n\\n\r\nAo Haru Ride is an emotional journey. It is not the plot but the characters and their strong feelings that will keep you glued to the screen. It is the characters' growth as persons that makes AHR worth a watch. Overall, AHR is an enjoyable series if you like a romantic story with good characters and a nice amount of comedy. I'm personally a big fan (of the manga also), so I enjoyed the series loads. I do not, however, count take enjoyment into account when making reviews. \\n\\n\r\nOverall AHR scored:\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nArt:7\\n\r\nSound:8\\n\r\nCharacter:9\\n\r\nOverall:  7.75\\n\r\nAHR deserves something in between 7 and 8, depending on your relationship with the genre. \\n",

            "content": "\u201cSometimes people put up walls, not to keep others out, but to see who cares enough to break them down.\u201d\r\nIt\u2019s nice to see a series like \u2018Ao Haru Ride\u2019 surface every now and again. Something that takes a well-known storyline type and adds some unique elements to differ the experience a bit. Nothing revolutionary or mind-blowing (doesn\u2019t need to be), but unique - to a pleasant degree - nonetheless. To put it as simply as possible: a refreshing visit to a familiar kind of storyline.\r\n[STORY]\r\n-----------\r\nThere\u2019s nothing overly complicated about the core plot; a story of two past lovers (in mutual spirit) reuniting later intheir lives \u2013 a second chance. But, it\u2019s the underlying layers and nuances woven throughout the narrative that strengthen and elevate it (a little bit) above the clich\u00e9 romp it could have been.\\n\\n\r\nNow, that\u2019s not to say that some parts of the show won\u2019t have you thinking \u201cI know where this is going.\u201d or \u201cReally?\u201d But compared to many others storylines of this type (Hollywood movies, novels, etc.) this is quite refreshing in a multitude of ways\u2026\\n\\n\r\n\u2018Ao Haru Ride\u2019 thankfully helps ease the viewer through the inevitable drama by adding in unique characters with their own individual personalities, great humor (naturally occurring through the characters) and by giving the viewer some room to breathe. It helps negate the stress of the drama somewhat, allowing it to become a plus rather than a minus.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall, the plot is rather solid considering the material \u2013 don\u2019t expect perfection though.\\n\\n\r\n[ART]\\n\r\n--------\\n\r\nProduction I.G has once again done a great job using their high quality of animation (as they are well known for animating action and effect-heavy anime) to animate something more tame and simple. The animation is cheery, energetic and bright \u2013 with a color palette that matches that very well. There were no drops in quality that I could find, and the few scenes with lots of motion were done well too. \\n\\n\r\n[SOUND]\\n\r\n-------------\\n\r\nThe background music compliments the series well \u2013 enhancing the current scene or giving a sense of the emotions present during a silent moment. A few of the tracks stand out on their own too, especially the opening track that, while being fun and energetic, is also surprisingly calm. It makes for a lovely lyrical meld of two differing emotions. \\n\\n\r\nOn the voice-acting side of things, everything is great. Everyone was well cast and emoted well. I know that seems direct, short and to the point, but that\u2019s really all that needs to be said concerning the seiy\u016b and their performances \u2013 they did very well.\\n\\n\r\n[CHARACTER]\\n\r\n-------------------\\n\r\nSince the only outstanding things about the secondary characters also tie into underlying plot points not mentioned in the synopsis, I won\u2019t talk about anyone other than our main two: Yoshioka and Kou.\\n\\n\r\nFirst we have Yoshioka, our main character. Yoshioka is an energetic, good-natured, kind and boisterous girl who loves the company of other people and having fun. Her naivety, energy and charm make her a fun character to follow onscreen. She goes through some decent character development as she matures a little and meets new people \u2013 the most important of whom is her past love-interest (and second main character), Kou.\\n\\n\r\nKou is a very complicated character.  In the past he was soft-spoken, kind, and dedicated. Now though, he is much more aloof, dry, and tactless \u2013 but there are hints abundant that the old Kou is still in there somewhere. Over the course of the series, we find out more about him and what caused this change (which is all I can say without veering into spoiler territory). \\n\\n\r\n[ENJOYMENT]\\n\r\n--------------------\\n\r\nHonestly, I enjoyed this series a lot more than I thought I would. I heard good things, but still kept my expectations low as I always do when watching a new show. In its entirety, this anime managed to pleasantly exceed my expectations.\\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL]\\n\r\n---------------\\n\r\nIt\u2019s not the best melodrama anime out there, but it\u2019s not a horrible anime in any sense of the word either. What it is, is a rather well done love story that\u2019s definitely worth a watch. \\n\\n\\n\r\n~FINAL SCORES~\\n\r\n----------------------\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\n--------------------\\n\r\nOVERALL: 8\\n",

            "content": "Welcome to the Vanilla cafe. Would you like to pre-order a vanilla pudding with vanilla toppings from our vanilla menu?\r\nAo Haru Ride is a shoujo romance slice of life manga adaptation of the same name. It follows a story of a curious high-schooler girl wishing to find out what happened to her crush from three years ago and why did he change. It has \"generic\" and Kimi ni Todoke written all over it just from looking at the cover, and going deeper, it further proves this statement.\r\nPlot:\r\nFutaba Yoshioka is your average 1st year in high school, who wishes to change herself and find new friends.She stumbles across her middle school crush, Kou Tanaka, who has changed his name to Kou Mabuchi. Shocked to find his personality completely changed, she starts testing her feelings for him, all in attempt to find out what happened to his old self.\\n\\n\r\nThe premise screams vanilla and generic all over the place, and it is just as it looks. It is your average shoujo romance with a double unrelated love triangle introduced later on. There is just nothing driving the romance forward and it uses cheap gimmicks in an attempt to move it further but it is really an uninteresting story once you get familiar with the characters. The main love triangle feels very artificial and is only there to make some progress, and the secondary love triangle isn't explored at all. The plot devices the anime introduce to kickstart an event are quickly forgotten. And, in the end, nothing happens. It is extremely predictable from the very start and not engaging. However, for an anime that is entirely character-driven, plot shortcomings aren't as important as in other shows.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe story follows a group of 5 teenagers. Starting from the worst, we have Murao, a silent and self-centered girl that later is not like that, for some reasons hardly mentioned. She is bland and uninteresting, but is a main piece of the second love triangle, as Kominato has a crush on her, and she has a crush on Kou's brother, Tanaka-sensei. Kominato himself is just a friendly and energetic guy, nothing else to say about him, he's not relevant at all. Yuuri is a shy but sweet girl who is a piece of the main love triangle, but it feels like she is just a plot device thrown in to escalate the plot. She has some sort of characterization and personality though, so she's not a bad character per se, but really underwhelming going against the main duo. Tanaka-sensei, Kou's brother, is an important character in Kou's personal drama and life and manages to have some good characterization in relatively short screen time.\\n\\n\r\nAnd here we have our main duo, with the main protagonist Futaba going first. Futaba is a rather curious and gentle girl who has a crush on Kou but starts questioning her feelings after meeting him, after she got supposedly dumped by him several years ago, and circles around Kou to find out more about his changed personality. Futaba is not a great character by herself, as she is rather simple and two dimensional at most, but the best part about her is that she makes some great character interactions with Kou and the rest of the squad. There's nothing special about her, but she is the one that moves the story forward entirely by herself.\\n\\n\r\nKou is the best character in the series, surprisingly because he acts as a pseudo-plot device for Futaba. His personal drama and personality change is done very, very well and is the biggest highlight of the show. He has an \"I don't care\" mentality and acts like a typical jerk, but for some reason the group constantly tries to get along with him instead of leaving him alone. His story was predictable, but executed well after all, and is the only part of the show that didn't come off as bland and boring. (like the rest of the show)\\n\\n\r\nFor a character driven show, only two characters are relevant to the story at all. And that is really bad. At first you would have some sort of hope that you get to see a lot of interesting character interactions and different approaches to romance from different characters and how they react and develop from it but in reality, once you get familiar with the characters (around half of the show), all of them, except for Futaba and Kou (and plot device Yuuri) become completely irrelevant. And that is not how an anime should treat its cast. There was a limit to how much Kou and his story could have carried the rest of the show, and he alone couldn't quite reach the top.\\n\\n\r\nWriting:\\n\\n\r\nFor the comedy, it is simple reactional stuff over and over again. Something happens, characters react and you are supposed to laugh. Basic, but it actually works better here than other shows since you have some sort of attachment to characters and most of the comedy comes from at times funny interactions between Futaba and Kou. There's no fanservice to keep you interested, and although it doesn't ruin the narrative by being there, which is a good thing, the show actually got boring mid-way through so I don't know, maybe they should have had that? There's not so much slice of life to talk about, but Futaba's wish to not be labeled as an outcast once she experiences that in middle school is done quite decently and worth mentioning (along with Yuuri's situation, although she is just ruined later on)\\n\\n\r\nThere aren't any obvious writing mistakes, apart from the extreme overuse of wind in dramatic  or tense situations, but I would like to mention that the show rather quickly and completely forgets a rather interesting plot device in \"making the main cast the class representatives\" which could have sparked some more interesting situations to happen. The anime didn't use the potential of some of the introduced elements and instead went along with the most generic and uninspiring way possible - a completely vanilla romance with no backdrops or anything else for you to care about. Didn't like the romance? Tough luck, there's nothing else for you here.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Sound:\\n\\n\r\nThere's nothing so much to talk about the animation, the art looks good but the chibi-looking face expressions were sometimes unnecessary and distracting, and made the show's comedy look like trying too hard.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is worth mentioning as having a few emotional pieces and rather well timed songs. It is easily the best technical aspect of the show, and you should look forward to the official soundtrack release. Another mention is Yuki Kaji in his role of Kou, which was executed outstandingly. I rather have him voicing these kind of characters rather than screamy kids (Eren, Satomi), cause here he can unfold his full potential.\\n\\n\r\nSummary:\\n\\n\r\nAo Haru Ride is just an extremely cliched and generic title. The execution is decent, however it could have been better, but there are just no other hooks or interesting elements or setting to keep you interested, and it gets boring half-way through unless you absolutely love the characters. Not everyone's the same though. If you like Shoujo romances, then it's definitely a watch. It is not a bad show, but it is not a good one either. It is right down the middle, and that's why it deserves the rating it gets.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict - 5.3/10\\n\\n",

            "content": "Ao Haru Ride (Blue Spring Ride) in the best sense can describe itself as a shoujo. The concept of a childhood girl developing a crush towards a boy is something that has been done over and over before. It also has a sense of innocence as the young Futaba Yoshioka sees boys as \u2018violent\u2019. The only exception is a boy named Kou Tanaka who she sees as gentle. The problem is that a simple misunderstanding leads to a separation between the two as Tanaka transfer from school. Simply put, the experiences that Futaba shared with Tanaka is a treasure. But that treasure right now isburied away until one day\u2026.\\n\\n\r\nBased off the manga of the same name created by Io Sakisaka, the series depicts a show that hits shoujo at its very core. Recognized perhaps for her character designs from the recent movie (HAL) and the manga Strobe Edge, Ao Haru Ride also stands out on its own in a variety of ways. It takes one of the most classic genres and steers it into a direction with honesty, drama, and a show full of charm. The time for Spring is one of those seasons when youth blooms. Ao Haru Ride follows a group of characters that becomes interconnected in a story of young love and growing up.\\n\\n\r\nThe story revolves a group of characters during their school days. It\u2019s easy to say that school is a setting for people to grow up and perhaps change themselves. Futaba tries to do exactly that as she makes effort to be less girly. Her actions speaks louder than words too such as when she purposely eats more than appears to be to play down her girly side. The friends she has made essentially can also be seen as the tough crowd as they ostracizes her later on. Nonetheless, Futaba is a genuine kind girl as shown through her relationship with Yuuri, a pretty classmate who is despised by other girls. Other characters joining the story includes the lone wolf Shuuko Murao and the energetic Aya Kominato. Most importantly, Kou returns but now goes by the name \u201cKou Mabuchi\u201d. This isn\u2019t the only change though. Unlike his gentle self, the new Kou makes a 180 degree personality change with his sarcastic behavior and cold gestures. Really, you\u2019re probably asking yourself what in the world happened, right?\\n\\n\r\nParts that can make you engaged to the characters is the diversity. Almost every character has a different personality yet they all become part of the story that gets interconnected in some way. A short arc during the show also gets the main characters together to on a camping trip where they must collectively work together to succeed. It takes on development routes as circumstances are bought up between characters as they grow closer. Examples include Kou and Yuuri where the latter seems to feel more towards him than just a friend. Similarly, Shuuko also begins to open up more after confessing her own interests. Regardless, the show connects relationships in a realistic way that can be relatable. Ever wondered how love ever blooms between certain people? Ao Haru Ride pushes the buttons between the characters to both show and tell exactly just that.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the most prominent relationship throughout the show is between Kou and Futaba. After all, there\u2019s so much contrast in their characters that a seemingly meaningful relationship between the two just seems to be impossible. There\u2019s a lot of teasing and sarcasm between the duo despite an obvious mutual attraction. Jealousy is also an easy feeling that both characters feel throughout the show during various scenarios. But for what\u2019s worth, their relationship will spark a curious interest. The \u201cwill they or won\u2019t they?\u201d will be one of those questions viewers will ask themselves a lot of the time. Their story stabs in the heart at times when moments are broken by misunderstandings or interruptions. Nonetheless, the show has grace and spirit and isn\u2019t afraid to pull out moments that draws them closer together. On the other hand, Kou\u2019s actions often contrasts what he says. In essence, he is one of those guys that isn\u2019t being entirely honest with himself and struggles to be closer with others. This stark contrast to his childhood self is an interesting insight to see as Futaba tries to remember their times together. Speaking of which, Futaba\u2019s feelings also resurfaces as she gets to know the current Kou. While his personality as a friend has changed, she recognizes that he is still the same person she comes to love. With a depth of flashbacks, it\u2019s easy to see how these two can connect together despite being so very different.\\n\\n\r\nNo relationship can be without misunderstandings and love triangles. Ao Haru Ride doesn\u2019t break far from that as it follows the clich\u00e9. The catch is that Futaba doesn\u2019t wish to hurt others despite of her own feelings. A part of the story depicts her inner struggles to tell a friend about what she feels towards the boy. And if you guess right, that friend also shares the same feelings as the boy he fell for. Awkward moments must be accepted for enjoyment or this show will haunt you like a ticking time bomb. Luckily the show doesn\u2019t play on a viewer\u2019s patience too much. Even when it gets a bit intimidating, the show still is able to manage by with its clever humor and dramatic dialogues. They are often lighthearted with no shock value or profane scenarios. The slight problem sometimes though is the way it tries, especially with its dialogues during conversations. While the drama can get emotional and feel realistic, it has empty thrills and predictable outcomes. Furthermore, there\u2019s little you can feel at times because of the stereotypes. And because Kou and Futaba are the main focus, there\u2019s an obvious lack of characterization on the other characters. We don\u2019t find out too much about other characters besides who they are on the surface and their personalities. In retrospect, they feel less conventional as the love triangle is more of a plot device to draw Kou and Futaba closer together. The collateral damage is the one that\u2019s hurt as they become a cannon fodder; without the actual injury of course.\\n\\n\r\nBesides romance, friendship and family values is also explored. The main girl trio (Futaba, Yuuri, Murao) often interacts in ways that girls should be like. The key difference is that Futaba\u2019s new friends treats her with actual sincerity. I think it\u2019s appreciable to see how they connect with different interests. They also open up with honesty and help each other out when help is needed the most. On the other hand, there is also some family connection between Kou and his brother Yoichi Tanaka. This isn\u2019t much explored in depth but does show that the two shares a connection despite their different personalities.  Just realize that it can be dull and the awkward meetings often feels static with little interest. Luckily, this is brightened up by the humor of the show. Playing as a class clown of sorts, Aya Kominato often brightens up the series with his ebullience. A noticeable factor about him is the fact that he doesn\u2019t have much social issues unlike many of the others. His obvious crush on Murao is often seen as a comedy relief as the latter pays little attention to his advances. While this seems amusing, the problematic development between the duo is almost non-existent. Again, the main focus of the show is Futaba and Kou so don\u2019t expect much depth on the others; at least not on the same level as those two childhood birds.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork maintains a youthful appearance throughout the series. The background centralizes on the theme of Spring with the graceful weather, palate framework, and simple yet convincing imagery. The outdoors and weather has distinctiveness with its consistency. Flashbacks are cleverly decorated with aura-like water paint to illustrate youth. However, character designs are moderate. Most characters look stiff and movements are limited. There\u2019s less much focus on how the characters look but rather than the moments they capture. Important scenes have longer focus with a cool down time before a transition. I think the purpose for this is to create new memories and show how characters make of them during those short yet meaningful moments. But nonetheless, studio Production I.G. brings its top notch A-game when it comes to overall animation adaptation.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack is surprisingly strong even for a shoujo series such as this. Both the OP and ED songs have colorful imagery and symbolism. The OP song possesses both energy and a girly-like feeling while the ED song depicts more of a montage. OST is well-timed during key moments to bring out the best message of what they are motivated to do. Certain background songs are also played that further heightens memorable moments. This usually applies to scenes when characters\u2019 connections seems to be at their closest almost if they are in their own little world. Character voice mannerism also deserves praise as well as we see a sharp contrast between the former Kou Tanaka and Kou Machibi. Shuuko is also noticeable for her cold mannerism as a lone wolf but slowly adapts to a more sincere girl through her change. On the other hand, Futaba\u2019s voice can be irritating to listen at times with her stereotype.\\n\\n\r\nFor a shoujo series, Ao Haru Ride is surprisingly well structured based on its story. It has the look and feel of what a shoujo series should be with its characters, visuals, and other commonly seen tropes. While the show doesn\u2019t characterize everyone at the same level, it\u2019s interesting to see how their lives become interconnected through one and another. And through that, relationship are developed that can be everlasting. The show also does well with its realism and wastes little time to flesh out what it\u2019s trying to do with the premise. Indeed, the show doesn\u2019t stride far from where it begins as we see the relationship development between Futaba and Kou. An issue might arise that makes the audience ask themselves \u2018was that it?\u2019 or when the story feels repetitive. Still, with what it has offered up in its sleeves, I can say that Ao Haru Ride is definitely a ride worth taking.\\n",

            "content": "\"If you lose something, just build it again.\" - direct quote from the main character Futaba.\r\nFirst off let me just say that the fact that I've read the manga already mildly hinders my ability to separate manga from anime...\r\nMILDY.\r\nSTORY:\r\nThe story is pretty well done. Of course it has ALL of the shoujo clique's that many shoujo fans will run into.\r\nThere's something about the story though that makes it a little more unique than your typical shoujo anime.\r\nI did not really sense any corny-ness with the more serious moments in the anime as I would typical feel in a shoujo.\r\nWhat I'm trying to say it that,it felt real.\\n\r\nThe situations felt pretty realistic to me & not so unimaginable or silly.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\r\nYour basic animation and art style for an Anime.\\n\r\nOf course not all art looks the same but the overall gist of it is your basic anime-shoujo style.\\n\r\nI bumped it up to an 8 because they changed the art to a very oil pastel look for the backgrounds when they would show a flashback. I found that pastel look to be very enjoyable & more interesting than making the flashback fuzzy/blurry.\\n\r\nBottom line, the Art is cute. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nAt first the opening/ending/BG music was too cute for me.\\n\r\nYou know that point of cute where it's almost obnoxious?\\n\r\nThat's how it felt for me...AT FIRST.\\n\r\nBut you get to know the characters and story-line more as you watch & you start to notice how WELL the sound really fits the anime.\\n\r\nAs serious as it gets sometimes...that's not the theme or message.\\n\r\nIt's lighthearted. It's fun.\\n\r\nAnd the opening is very fitting. The bouncing up & down beat sets up the story because it shows how up & down the characters situations are.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER(s):\\n\r\nStreaming off from the SOUND comment,\\n\r\nthe characters are all just trying to make the best of the situation and the opening represents that really well.\\n\\n\r\nHere's a bit of a warning...\\n\r\nI do not think you will like every part of any one of the characters.\\n\r\nLike books, characters are not always meant to be relatable or liked.\\n\r\nAll of the characters CAN be likable IF you accept the side of them that is NOT likable.\\n\r\nThat's what the anime is about.\\n\r\nYou can have all the unlikable traits you want but if you just (stemming off from what the Anime will eventually show what the characters want...) \"open up your heart\", you WILL be accepted.\\n\r\nCorny thought? Yes.\\n\r\nBut this is the best way I can explain the characters.\\n\\n\r\nHad to give a 7 though because all were very predictable characters.\\n\r\nNothing new.\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\r\nI said above that I read the manga. The manga is AMAZING. As with any manga-to-anime adaption, the manga is always best.\\n\r\nDetails.\\n\r\nA cleaner set-up to situations.\\n\r\nBetter understanding of characters. (Although the Anime did throw in some really good quotes/one-liners!)\\n\\n\r\nHOWEVER, I still enjoyed the Anime.\\n\r\nI enjoyed actually watching how the characters move. How they interact. Grow. The funny faces/body language they would make.\\n\r\nVery enjoyable...if you have patience.\\n\r\nIf you're tired of that stoic shoujo boy then you shouldn't watch this because I doubt you'd be able to stomach how stoic the boy is at first.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nI found the Anime to be well made.\\n\r\nIt was a decent adaptation from the manga. Included A LOT of major & key things as well as set it up for....wait for it...\\n\r\nTHE NEXT SEASON.\\n\r\nHint hint to non-manga readers, that person we briefly get introduced to in the end is going to be an important person in the next season.\\n\r\nIf it gets renewed for the next season. *fingers crossed*\\n\\n\r\nI'm telling you guys...the things that happen WILL make you keep watching :)\\n",

            "content": "I have not read the source material for the show and the following review is for the anime adaption only, the manga, LN or other source material is not included in my review of this anime.\r\nAo Haru Ride is a character driven romance between the two main characters Kou and Futaba. The show kicks off when Futaba recognizes Kou at her high school and goes on from there.\r\nStory\r\nI pretty much already went over the basic premise but, it's also important to know that Kou and Futaba knew each other in middle school. The premise itself is kind of generic which isn't entirely bad. I likedhow the two main characters had met in the past and, now Kou was entirely different for reasons unknown to Futaba and the viewers. It was a good way to hook people.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the art of the show. It was colorful and, the character designs fit the settings and, the characters themselves. The art is distinguishable from other series but isn't anything unique or all that interesting.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nThe show had a good OP and ED. The music during the show was appropriate and, sounded nice. Also, there was some good voice acting for the characters, especially Kou.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nSadly, most of the characters in Ao Haru Ride aren't all that great. The characters I didn't like were Yuuri, Kominato, Murao and Kou. \\n\\n\r\nIn the case of Kominato and Murao, they didn't add anything to the story. The show would have been the same if they weren't there. So why were they in the story, I don't know? In addition to not having a point, they aren't particularly interesting and, the viewer isn't really given a reason to care for them.\\n\\n\r\nYuuri is the second member of the Kou fan club and, the third member of the show's love triangle. The problem with her is that again, she doesn't do anything for the story, it would have been the same if she was removed from the show. All she does after befriending Futaba is obsess over a CD she borrowed from Kou. The fact that she and, Futaba both love Kou is supposed to be a source of conflict for herself and Futaba but, it doesn't really cause any issues in their relationship. Her love for Kou doesn't cause any conflict for the two main characters Kou and Futaba. Why I didn't include her with the other two pointless side characters is because Yuuri is supposed to have a purpose. She is supposed to be a part of the story. She is supposed to cause conflicts between the two main characters and, have conflicts with them but, she fails at all of the points I listed. \\n\\n\r\nKou starts off as an interesting character. The viewer is after all supposed to be drawn into the show by his mysterious change from being kind and, quiet to cold and, \"too cool to care\". My problem with Kou isn't that he can be an annoying, angsty teenager. My problem is that he isn't a consistent character. Somewhere around episode 7 or 8 all of his progression just disappears until the final episode. It feels really unnatural and, forced for the sake of the \"story\" which is finding out why Kou is different then he was before. \\n\\n\r\nAo Haru Ride forces this unnatural character reset by having Yuuri and, Futaba pursue Kou before they find anything out about him. If the writers would have put the revelations about Kou's past at the start of the show and, then had Futaba and Yuuri try to get with him everything would have made more sense and, Kou wouldn't have had to have a forced character reset.\\n\\n\r\nFutaba, and Kou's brother are the only other relevant characters in the show. They are both members of the Kou fan club and, I didn't have any particular problems with either of them. That being said they aren't really all that great of characters either since the only thing about them that matters is how they feel about Kou.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the beginning of the show. It may have been a generic premise but, it was well executed. I wanted to know more about the characters and, was interested to see how the show would progress. However, the addition of the side characters, love triangle and, after Kou's character reset, Ao Haru Ride just wasn't all that interesting or, something I really cared about anymore. One scene that left a terrible impression with me was when Kou told Futaba that he could sexually assault her if he wanted to after climbing on top of her. I just felt that it was unnecessary and, in bad taste.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nI gave Ao Haru Ride a 4/10. It has good art and music but neither of these elements overcome the pit falls of the show. The biggest problem of the show is that it forces character \"resets\" for the sake of the story. Another problem is that the side characters don't do anything to warrant their inclusion in the show. For reference the most useful side character is Kou's brother whose only job is to feed Futaba information about Kou and, his back story. Finally, I really hated the creepy sexual assault scene.\\n\\n\r\n***DISCLAIMER*** I have not read the source material for the show and the review is for the anime adaption only. The manga, light novel or other source material is not included in my review of this anime.\\n",

            "content": "**I have only seen the anime of Ao Haru Ride and this review is only based on that.\r\nSo as a person who rarely watches Shoujo anime this was a first for me, so keep that in mind. \r\nAo Haru Ride/Blue Spring Ride/\u30a2\u30aa\u30cf\u30e9\u30a4\u30c9 ; 12 episode a 20minutes, aired from July to September 2014; Comedy, Drama, SoL, Romance, Shoujo, School; licensed by Sentai Filmworks\r\nAo Haru Ride starts with a premise that seems typical for this type of anime - a slice of life show that wants to show the development of a romance and of the characters. The story is set in high school and focusesaround a small group of teenagers. Mostentimes, these kind of animes are made by the nuances, the art and the soundtrack since the story is mostly very linear, predictable or repetitive. This is partly the case here aswell.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\r\nLike I already mentioned, the storyline of this type of anime are very linear and predictable, and this is also the case here. It could honestly be worse, but I wouldn't call it an extremely sophisticated and good story. But it surely isnt bad. It revolves around the classical trope of re-meeting a past lover in your 2nd life/later life, and this is also the case here. Futaba meets Kou again after they spent a term in middle school together and fell in love. However, both of them changed, but the feelings obviously remain. The anime does a good job in focusing around their relationship and its development as they get to know each other and learn what happened in the time they missed. Sadly some interesting side characters are a bit left out in the story development - Murao, Kominato - but its only natural for the plotline.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nI dont know too much about the producing studios so I cant tell much about their reputation/part in the production of the art, but it sure is good. In the beginning, I thought some parts of it were strange, but in the end I was fully captured by the beautiful color selection and the well-animated motion scenes. I gave it a 10 because it felt like the art was very much perfect for the vibe the story had created. You will not be disappointed by the art thats for sure.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nI'm not a particular fan of the japanese music nor of anime music, so normally I dont give particularly good ratings for the sound. However the OP and ED were both very fitting and enjoyable, and the music choice in the series also just perfect for the situation. Funny fast music for comedic sccenes, slow and monotone for dialogues and thinking and enjoyable and vivid for love and happiness scenes. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nWhile I think the characters are all extremely realistic and well-portrayed, the predictability and the underdevelopment of very interesting characters steals quite some points here. Others may disagree, but oftentimes a shift of focus onto the supporting characters, especially in the later part of the series, would have helped a lot to show the progression of the group of friends. But the two main characters are explained and focused very deeply which adds more spice and sense to the storyline, which is a really good thing (uff phrasing). \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nI personally would call this an \"anime oozing with love, cuteness and understanding\" but that wouldnt exactly be true. However, its the part which made the series so good for me: just a lot of romance coupled with the problems of everyday life and battling with depression. The mutual help the two mains give each other to overcome their problems is portrayed in such a good and convincing way, the romance was just bound to come. It all felt very realistic and the extremely good portrayal of such deserved to get a 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nShortly said: The predictability and linear part of the storyline was largely compensated by the amazing art and the well-thought character development. Depening on your personal feelings and attitudes, you will enjoy this anime or enjoy it a lot - its open to you. I would suggest everyone who likes romance and school SoL animes to watch this show, its really good.\\n\\n\r\nForecast: I won't read the manga, but what I heard and read about it it seems to be really good and clearly adds a deeper thought and process to the relationship between Kou and Futaba. To my knowledge it has already ended or atleast it will this spring, but I'm not entirely sure. Also I predict that this anime will get a 2nd season - the ending of the first clearly leaves a lot of room for story improvement.\\n\\n\r\n**This is my first review, nor is english my native language so bear with me. If you have any feedback PLEASE tell me so I can improve. I will write a review for every anime show I watch from now on, so I do want to write good quality reviews. Thanks for your reading!",

What makes it unique, however, is that the conflict is softly given focus throughout the series, causing viewers to feel unanticipated emotions in the culmination of the story wherein the characters reveal their hidden sides (weaknesses and strengths included) and emotional baggage. \r\nI highly recommend this anime to individuals who are looking for a warm and charming anime that will enkindle thrill, sorrow andfeelings of hopefulness.",

            "content": "My review is only 2 words:\r\nShoujo Oregairu\r\nBut MAL isn't letting me make such a short review so the rest is padding and a general view of the usage of cinematography in Anime.\r\nWhat primarily makes animation different from film is the complete creative control over the medium. This means that what previously had to be sought out in small spaces of reality, the perfect shot, the perfect actions, the perfect outplay of emotions, can now be rectified to the minute-test detail. Tarkovsky, the famous Russian film director, had to reconstruct his family home from scratch in the middle of a beautiful plot of Russian field andforest during the filming of The Mirror. In The Sacrifice he had to pull off a 7 minute long shot of a burning house which he couldn't re-do due to the lack of budget to rebuild the house. This doesn't have to be done in animation. In theory one could do away with editing altogether and have seamless flowing animation. The only film I know that uses a single shot for the whole film is Russian Ark. Animation doesn't need the vast set required to film like that, it can simply metamorphosize one shot into another.\\n\\n\r\nYet of course budget concerns force animators to still edit in shots. We need our premade backgrounds to cut corners. If Shinkai had made a 5cm Per Second where everything moved as vibrant as life itself besides being romantically beautiful the project probably would have crashed and burned. Some animators carry over their techniques from cinema to animation. Hideaki Anno's training in live film can be seen in the way he perfects atmosphere through his isolated shots, not just for action to action transitions. Shinbo is able to maximize the power of editing by using lightning fast montages to convey speed to his works.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation also allows the control of colour palette and complete composition. Ao Haru Ride uses the pastelly color palette of traditional shojo to lighten the mood while White Album 2 (which I watched at the same time) carries over its Visual Novel influence by giving everything a Shinkai-ish gleam and use high lightning contrasts and chiaroscuro in its most beautiful red evening shots. Shinbo's minimalism stands out on its own and the peak of oneiric animation is seen through his collaboration of Gekidan Inu Curry for Madoka Magica.\\n\\n\r\nIn animation everything can move and every dream is true. The European animation The Illusionist is an example of complete generosity. Every shot is cluttered with activity and jokes, following the comedic film-philosophy of Jacques Tati. One could say that the main philosophical thrust of animation should be Panta Rei. It should reflect the dreaming river of the world.\\n\\n\r\nThe greatest sin of animation is a lack of imagination and movement. Movies can get off being slow and dictated by a stonish reality. Books can get off being prosaic and preachy. If you want to be preachy in animation the world must move with your words. That's why Bakemonogatari works. Animation is the bastion to save one from the horror vacui. It is Borges' Total Library or the world of Tlon. Miyazaki acknowledged that the primary drive of animation was dreams. People must not forget that its a medium where anything is possible.\\n\\n\r\nStill if we let everything BE possible we would find ourselves in a bloated stew. Even the variety of Spirited Away has an ordering principle behind the shots and reveals. The world of limitless imagination is a monster that eats away at logic and sanity. Evangelion is a documentation of that edge, much like how Artaud's poetry was in the past.\\n\\n\r\nOur ambition is to have a medium that contains everything, our songs, our dreams, our nightmares, our depths and our surfaces. We should, when dealing with animation, have a voracious greed to expand this illusory world with experiences, and in doing so paradoxically expand the reaches of the real as well.",

            "content": "I wanted to watch Ao Haru Ride just because it's shoujo, and I really like shoujo. I put my hopes up high with this anime. I heard GREAT things about the manga and so I expected the anime to be as fascinating. What I found was good but not as good as I wished.\r\nStory: 7.\r\nIt was... typical. Very, very typical. Girl and Boy are in love since years ago. Girl still is. Boy says he's not. Another Girl falls in love with Boy. Girl and Another Girl are best friends. That's cool, I'm not saying it's not, but it's not surprising anyone. Does Boy actuallylove Girl? Well, read the manga.\\n\r\nAlso, story develops slowly which is good. You see how five friends start to like each other and end up thinking of a future together. There are cracks in the way but they do care about their friendship. \\n\r\nHowever, I wish we had more about Murao and Tanaka's storyline. I can't explain why, but I found their story more appealing than Futaba-Mabuchi's.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8.\\n\r\nAnimation was really good. Scenes were colorful, bright and just nice to watch. Sometimes the design of characters seemed rushed but close-ups were amazing. Also, pastel colors in flashbacks were A+.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9.\\n\r\nIt's weird for me to say this because I usually never pay attention to soundtrack in anime, but I enjoyed it so, so much. The soudntrack just FITS and the opening is catchy and cute. I can't explain it any better.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6.\\n\r\nI guess I was... kinda disappointed. At first I thought Mabuchi was an asshole. He doesn't feel comfortable enough to get out of the shell till the end. He's misterious, quiet. He has this dark vibe around him that many may find attractive. Well, I have to say that I didn't and still don't.\\n\r\nFutaba reminded me of Misaki (from Kaich\u014d wa Maid-sama!) and Risa (from Lovely Complex), characters who I adore. Futaba, however, pretends to be unladylike just to fit while Misaki and Risa actually are like that. It was interesting to see how she and Mabuchi develop in their true self towards the end.\\n\r\nYuuri was too cute for me, to the point that it was kinda irritating. On the other hand, we have her opposite, Murao, who I liked a lot.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7.\\n\r\nIt was good. I mean, not amazing, but it was good. It'll probably warm your heart but you won't think of Ao Haru Ride the morning after you finish the anime. At least, I didn't.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.\\n\r\nIf I was 16 years old, I would have enjoyed this story a lot more than I did. I guess I'm getting old because I found the whole anime kind of childish (honestly I don't even know what I was expecting, they're in high school). It was still good tho.\\n\r\nWhat I found interesting is that this anime kinda teachs you to be true to yourself. At first, you find that everyone is who they want to be- but who they want to be is not who they really are.\\n",

This anime appears to just basically be your usual school/romance anime, but it's so much more than that. I can say for sure that Ao Haru Ride has become my favorite romance anime (not including comedy/romance) there was comedy thrown in but i look at this as a romance, not a comedy. \r\nThe story is very basic and isn't totally outstanding but it's the characters themselves that gotme hooked. The art is very unique and wonderful (Production I.G. is personally my favorite studio and always seems to do a fantastic job). I absolutely loved this anime and had so much fun watching it, it's  a romance but it can be so intense at some points as if you were watching a fight scene in Attack On Titan. It had me cheering, upset, happy, excited, just everything. Whenever Kou and Futaba were together  I just got so excited and interested. \\n\\n\r\nLike I mentioned earlier, the story and overall plot itself isn't that unique or outstanding but the backstory behind Kou is where the story really shines and shows how Kou has became sorta the heartless person he is today. \\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend watching this anime even if you aren't too into the whole romance thing. I had so much fun watching this and it even had me jumping out of my seat at one point or another O.O There are very few romance anime that I can say i actually thoroughly enjoyed, but this tops them all. And if you do like romance anime, why haven't you watched this yet? Get to it!",

            "content": "A white shirt. That's what Ao Haru Ride reminds me of.\r\nAs more and more shoujo, school-life animes with all the romance and complications that come with it are released; people are starting to see the typical pattern of the girl meets boy or vice versa. Ao Haru Ride follows this pattern which is present in most popular shoujo/school/romance animes; however this does not mean it isn\u2019t worth your time.\r\nI gave the story a 7 (Good), for the sole reason of the anime exploring the changes that occurs in one\u2019s life when they push themselves out of their comfort zones. The anime encourages young individuals tofully experience their youths and to never hesitate on their decisions which can positively affect their life. It also shows the importance of expressing a person\u2019s individuality, especially in the society we live in now, where there are many pressures to change one-self, for the benefit of others.  The 3 points lost was due to the fact that the story, romance-wise, follows a common pattern, mentioned above in the previous paragraph.\\n\\n\r\n9 (Great) for the artstyle. The high points given were due to the expression of character as well as their situation and ambient feel. Ao haru ride uses common, yet effective ways to communicate the characters emotions and their environment to the audience. \\n\\n\r\nSound was also given a 9 because of how effective it communicates the character\u2019s emotions to the audience.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe charactersation of the characters in Ao Haru Ride accurately reflects the attitudes of most people who are in high school, that\u2019s why it got a 10 (outstanding). The main heroine protagonist Yoshioka Futaba is always putting up a fa\u00e7ade in order to blend in with the crowd. The anime really excels at showing the progress as well as the few stuff ups she\u2019s made to change her life throughout the series, and it shows that every little thing you do counts. The main male protagonist, Mabuchi Kou is complicated. He was initially a shy-boy during his junior highschool years, however his personality changed due to the events mentioned in the series. His attitude towards school is nonchalant, yet he always pushes the heroine to a better path whenever she strays from it. He is kind, but also distant. The other characters like Murao Shuuko and Makita Yuuri  also are very realistic and interesting characters. Particularly Makita Yuuri, who, unlike the heroine, did not decide to put a fa\u00e7ade in order to fit in at school. Therefore, the combination of realistic and interesting characters which makes up Ao Haru Ride has given it a 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment throughout watching the whole series was 7 (Good). This is because I have personally watched many shoujo-romance animes which is reminiscent of this one, which takes away the excitement from knowing the outcomes of character decisions as well as situations. However, if you are still new to the shoujo-romance-highschool   genre, this is definitely worth a try.\\n\\n\r\nThe overall score is 8. The main positives which contributed to the high score were the Art, Sound and the Characters. However the fairly common patterns in romance-shoujo animes are present in Ao Haru Ride, making it a pretty flat series. Despite this, like a white shirt, Ao Haru Ride, is simple, effective and suits every situation. It\u2019s best for all ages, although younger audiences might gain more wisdom from the moral of the series as well as the characterisation.\\n",

            "content": "After a long time debating whether or not I should watch this short anime I decided to give it a shot\r\nStory 8/10\r\nIt starts off sweet, 2 people who loved each other in middle school finally reunited, but the problem is that they have both changed and don\u2019t love each other the way they are now. There\u2019s plenty of things to keep you interested in this anime especially if you like romance, comedy and school based anime\u2019s. The plot may seem to drag on a little at times but isn\u2019t too bad once you get into it. One thing that I hated about the plot wasthe love triangle that was added. It just seemed unnecessary and how quickly Futaba\u2019s friend fell for Kou despite hardly knowing him while the protagonist has known him longer. Despite that the anime was enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\nI enjoyed the art style of this anime, it looked polished and done well.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\r\nThe music was surprisingly good and fit with the story well. The opening has nice art and a good song. The voice acting is good and nice to hear.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 7/10\\n\r\nThe main characters Futaba and Kou are interesting and have interesting personalities. They show there love without talking about it and in their own way without letting the other find out. Although Kou was annoying some of the time, well I guess he had a lot of growing up to do. At times I wish he would be more serious and care about stuff as he was in the past.  The other side characters are kind of realistic, a girl who secretly loves her sensei and didn\u2019t have friends before, the other is a shy girl whose behaviour resembles what Futaba\u2019s was like during middle school.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10\\n\r\nI enjoyed watching this as I enjoy love stories and shoujo here and there.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\r\nI recommend this anime \\n",

            "content": "Plot: 7/10\r\n Summary: Ao Haru Ride takes place in your typical Japanese high school like many other animes of its genre. Overall it centers over main character Futaba who is in her second year of high school. It begins with immediate flashbacks to middle school where she meets the sweet Kou Tanaka. The two begin to get close making it obvious that a romantic relationship could start. But because of her classmates' rude comments regarding how appealing Futaba is to guys, she begins to feel insecure. They say that because she is so appealing to the boys in school, girls don't want to be herfriend. So in attempt to shed the image of being the \"cute girl\" she makes the loud statement that she doesn't like guys, AT ALL. Of course Kou overhears this without ever knowing her true feelings. Fast forward to Futaba's second year of high school and she is now popular with more female friends even though they may be fake at times. She achieves this through trying to act more masculine. Meanwhile, Kou has moved away and lives elsewhere in Japan. When he moves back Futaba has to deal with the drama that surrounds his return. \\n\r\nI give the plot of this show a 7/10 because it tends to be generic and follows a lot of the typical anime tropes. There's a lot of back and forth and wishy-washyness throughout which can get a bit annoying at times. The reason I give this a higher score is because the emotional aspects of it make you want to stay with the plot and root for the main characters. The worst thing about this anime in my opinion is that it ends way too abruptly. Being only 12 episodes long, you can expect them to have a hard time telling the whole story in great detail without skipping a lot of things. Having read the manga, this anime ends before the real meat and potatoes of the story even begins. There's a couple of characters that we don't even meet in the anime. It's the kind of anime that leaves you wanting to read the manga. If you like the anime I definitely recommend reading the manga to get even more of this sweet story.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 7/10\\n\r\nI would give the characters a 10/10 if it wasn't for some of the annoyingness of the 2 main characters. Futaba is really sweet and means well but she can tend to be the typical shoujo ditz at times. Kou can also get super indecisive and lies about his true feelings which can get on your nerves at times. But at the end of the day all of the characters are pretty likeable. I also feel that they did an excellent job with characterization despite the short time frame. You really feel connected to all of the major characters and get into their story. There's always the wish to get into more backstories with certain people, but not even the manga delivers that. \\n\\n\r\nMusic 9/10 \\n\r\nMusic doesn't really play a huge part in this anime. But when it does, it really brings out the emotion. I wouldn't say it brought me to tears at any point, but it definitely ties together the scenes when it's used. The theme song is also nice and catchy. It will get stuck in your head!\\n\\n\r\nAnimation 9/10 \\n\r\nThe animation in this in my opinion is pretty strong. It has a lot of lighter colors and smooth edges. For such a short anime they took the time to make it look pretty darn good. It also sticks very close to the style of the manga. Like any anime it has it's moments where the animation looks a little wonky, but overall a job well done.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\r\nI give this anime and 8/10 because even with its generally generic plot and characters that can get a little tiresome at times, the anime brings emotion and a truly moving story. The animation is pretty spot on and if you enjoy the musical aspects of a show you will enjoy that as well. In addition if you like a good dramatic romance with a *SPOILER) happy ending, this anime is for you. And again, if you watch this a like it, I strongly recommend that you read the manga which is already finished. It will leave you wanting more.",

            "content": "It absolutely befuddles me how this anime managed to get a rating of almost 8. I had heard it was clich\u00e9d, but that it managed to have a fresh approach on those clich\u00e9s. I heard it was both funny and emotional. Nope. Not at all. This anime is the same old clich\u00e9s used over and over again. I find it almost insulting that multiple users recommended this for fans of \"Tonari-no Kaibutsu-kun\", a beautifully done anime which has essentially nothing in common with this anime, and has characters a million times better than those in \"Ao Haru Ride\".\r\nThis is one of those anime where theguy treats the girl like crap, yet she somehow ends up falling for him. This is one of those anime that says if a guy is hostile towards you, it just means he cares. This is one of those anime that says no matter how horrible a person is, if you love them enough, you can change them.\\n\\n\r\nHere is a list of some of the clich\u00e9s used in this anime. There are two girls that are just so pretty that the guys all love them and as a result the girls all hate them. Petty love triangles. Girl falls for a guy because he shows basic human decency. Girl falls for the guy even though he's a huge ass that emotionally, physically, and verbally abuses her. Overprotective love interest. Long lost love. Girl stalking the guy she likes. Other annoying crap.\\n\\n\r\nWas this why I stopped watching the anime? No, the reason is much simpler and much more disturbing than that. What is it, you ask? It's when Kou tells Futaba she could get hurt if she walked around alone at night. It's when she doesn't know what he's talking about, so he pins her to the ground and makes a move as though he's going to sexually assault her. It's when he basically says, \"I could rape you if I wanted to.\" It's the fact that this messed up scene is supposed to be viewed as him just caring for her, and her seeing that as a sign of affection and being totally okay with it. THAT is where I drew the line.\\n\\n\r\nSo if you're okay with clich\u00e9d anime that portray young women as being idiots who have a tendency to fall in love with jerks, guys who treat the girls they have feelings for like gum on the bottom of their shoes (because we all know that if a guy is terrible to you, it means he secretly likes you\u2014yeah, no; didn't believe it when my grandmother told me that about the bully I had in first grade, and I don't believe it now), stupid people, and guys who act like they're superior because they happen to have a Y chromosome, then go ahead. Watch the anime.",

            "content": "It's rare that I write a good review, but Ao Hara Ride deserves it.\r\nAo Haru Ride is a breath of fresh air in the cliche-ridden Shoujo genre, where i seems like half of shoujo anime are carbon copies of one another.\r\nAo Haru Ride offers something new, interesting, and touching, with relatable but unique characters, great development, an interesting plot and beautiful, unique art and music that tugs at your heart. \r\nThe main heroine is the usual happy, cheerful type, but she has extra layers that make her complex, interesting, and unique Futaba changed her appearance and attitude in order to fit in with her groupof friends- she eats a lot, wears no makeup, and makes her hair messy so she won't look cute, because in middle school she was bullied by jealous girls due to the attention she received from men. Who can't relate to this- this desire to change yourself in order to fit in? The desire to have friends so badly that you even believe there's something wrong with you, and you need to be different? \\n\r\nThe story also makes a strong - and again, relatable - point that the friends you make when you change yourself and act like someone you aren't to fit in, aren't real friends- real friends love and accept you for who you are. The scene where Futaba is alone and starts crying, and Kou hugs her so her old friends can't see she is crying, and he tells her those aren't her real friends- that is one of the most touching scenes in anime. \\n\r\nThe anime is full of touching scenes that resonate in your soul, leave you thinking and teary eyed yet smiling. \\n\r\nKou, for example, comes off as an arrogant, cheeky guy, but he's actually very sensitive, serious and closed off to the world. Futaba has to work to understand him, the pain he's been through, and we can all relate to Kou as well- who built up walls to keep people out, only to see who would care enough about him to break down those walls. His character's changes were also very realistic, and his pain was relatable - lots of people experience what he did and react similarly.  \\n\\n\r\nAo Haru Ride may look like just another sweet school romance anime, but it has so many touching themes and ideas. It touches on the importance, sweetness, and pain of relationships- both romantic, familiar, and friendship ones - and many other ideas that teenagers and everyone can relate to. It truly is wonderful, refreshing, and beautiful in every aspect. My only complaint was...I guess the animation could've been better?",

            "content": "*Contains spoilers*\r\nBefore you watch an anime, you occasionally check the tags it has got, so you know what to expect from it right? Well, you're wrong with this one.\r\nAo Haru Ride is supposed to be a romance anime, since the plot is mainly about two protagonists, who go through an inner development and come to the conclusion that they have feelings for another. Pretty basic romance plot.\r\nAo Haru Ride's plot is nothing outstanding, but it still manages to fascinate you at the beginning.\r\nThis anime, does a good job in showing how these characters grow throughout time, but completely ignores the fact, that the characters arebound to confess each others feelings sometime.\\n\r\nWhat it does, is to prolong this as long as possible, until the time is up and all you get to see is people looking back at memories of spending time together, while disregarding the feelings they still have for the other person.\\n\\n\r\nIf you don't expect a kiss shared by anyone in the anime, go right ahead and watch it. It'll be great for you.\\n\r\nWhen I read ROMANCE, I expect a passionate relationship between two people. A relationship being a situation, where you get intimate with each other, where the first step would be to share a kiss.\\n\\n\r\nFrom what I've seen in this anime, all of these people were FRIENDS. Not saying that they haven't shared powerful, life changing moments, but they still stay good friends and nothing more, even if the people clearly have feelings for someone.\\n\\n\r\nI've seen this in a lot of animes, where the writers simply decide to make a \"cliff hanger\", not revelaing anything, so they can develop a second season, which comes out years later, when everyone has forgotten about it.\\n\r\nThis is not how you keep your viewers interested. Giving them something \"real\", is what makes them say: \"wow. I really enjoyed this\".\\n\r\nRight now I feel like I've wasted my time watching it all the way to the end.\\n\\n\r\nTaking away the romance from a romance anime, would be like driving a car without fuel.\\n\\n\r\nBesides this main problem, the anime has a great art style and music. I enjoyed singing along to the soundtrack. I don't want to say, that I had a smile at the ending of every episode, but it has an relaxing, friendly atmosphere, which makes you want to come back for more.\\n\r\nThis is exactly why I feel bad writing this review. I really had high hopes for this anime, but it left me dssapointed, although it really had potential.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: If you are looking for an anime, that has nothing to offer regarding romance, this is perfect for you.\\n",

            "content": "Love is a lot of things. Especially for young people. Sometimes, love can make you a better person. Sometimes, being loved can make you evolve. Love changes people, for the better or the worse. Such is the simple premise of Ao Haru Ride (AHR). \r\nPlot\r\nThe story of AHR is a classic one. Yoshioka Futaba, a normal high school girl, meets her long lost middle school crush, Kou. Neither of the two have feelings for each other any longer, but upon meeting him again, Futaba falls in love.  The story is as simple as that, Futaba denying her love, yet chasing Kou all the same.This story is in no way original. But please, do not be fooled by the generic plot. Even without originality, AHR is classic shoujo at is best.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing of AHR is, in my opinion, amazing. Of all the shoujo I have seen and read, AHR by far has the most natural development. The story, being an unoriginal slice-of-life, has a clear disadvantage in its innate dullness. The only way to really fight this is development of the plot. The faster the pacing, the less boring, right? And while this is true, too fast pacing makes a plot seem rushed and incoherent. AHR manages to move forward at exactly the right pace. The development of the characters' relationships are at all time present in such a way that you really feel that they get closer to each other with each moment, each conversation. The development seems so natural that it reminds me of myself making new friends. While the story mainly relies on the characters,  small changes of setting (such as school trips, after school studying, etc.) are introduced regularly, moving the series farther from boring. The comedy as well is done at the right times, giving the series a comedic side, without spoiling the romance. All in all the dull core of the plot is handled very well and turned into a good story. \\n\\n\r\nTo round up about the pacing, I'd say that even the romance is well-paced. The development is smooth, more physical than you would usually see in shoujo - which is a good contrast to what is often seen in shoujo. \\n\\n\r\nAs  in usual shoujo the side stories of the supporting characters are very important. While the stories of these are as cliched as the main one, they serve their purpose of spicing the series up well enough. \\n\\n\r\nApart from the unoriginality there are few inconsistencies in the plot, such as, for one, why it took Futaba almost a year to notice that she was in the same school as Kou. \\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nWhile many people praise the art, I'd say it's good, but nothing amazing. The characters are, of course, extremely handsome in a cute, natural way. However, I wont give the anime much credit for that since the drawings in the manga are a lot better. The animated design of the characters is nice, but pretty medicore, considering the animation quality of this year. I'm honestly a bit disappointed that they didn't make better use of Sakisaka Io's beautiful style. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, the art is overall nice. The backgrounds are done with water colours, giving them an extra cute, innocent feelings that fits the story. The same can be said about the colours, them mainly being light and unsaturated. \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe sound is really one of the good point of the series. The opening and ending are well-fitting, the opening being upbeat yet cute, the ending a slow, emotional tune. The OSTs are bordering amazing. The main theme is  a cute tune, bordering melancholic with slow pacing and piano, really contributing to creating the right mood. Generally, the music is really well-used - funny tunes being played at the comedic moments, an embarrassing tune for the weirder moments. As a tip of the iceberg, they have incorporated an amazingly sad and heartwarming song (I will by Chelsy) for romantic moments, really reflecting their tragic love story. The song is widely praised, and not without reason, just as it is used perfectly in the series, sometimes playing instead of dialogue. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting of the series is quite good as well. How fitting the cast is can be discussed, but the actors do quite good jobs. Kou (Kaji Yuki) does a superb job. Personally, I didn't think he fitted the role, but by the end of the series he had me convinced. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThe one point where AHR really shines is the characters. I earlier said that the pacing was what saved the story from being boring and not worth a watch, while the pacing definitely contributes to making the series good, what really makes the story exciting, original even, are the characters. \\n\\n\r\nStarting with the main character, Futaba, who is really just our annoying, boyish, usual shoujo heroine - or? Indeed in the beginning of the series, Futaba has so many annoying traits that she almost isn't likable. She is pretending to be boyish to gain friends who are even more annoying and superficial than herself. It is not only a horrible story, it has also been seen before. However, the development she experiences when she meets Kou is immense. She goes from selfish and stupid to being a sweet girl, thinking more about others than herself. Futaba becomes everything a shoujo heroine needs to be - and more. \\n\\n\r\nThe supporting characters are unoriginal, but they serve their purpose. Yuuri is the cutest thing ever, which creates the drama a shoujo needs. Murao is mature and refined, Kominato cheerful and friendly. The one character I really like - and see as more original - is Tanaka-sensei. I really like his role in the story and bringing in a teacher definitely spices up things. The supporting characters created drama and plot and they ensure that everyone can find a character of their liking in the series.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now, last of all, I want to talk about Kou. Personally, I love Kou's indifferent, cold, cheeky character, and even though he might be unlikable to some, his rude character is explained throughout the story. Beneath all the layers of attitude, he is an emotional boy, haunted by his past.  While we see the story from Futaba's point of view, the one the story really revolves around is Kou. Kou is the deep, clever character that question the actions of others. Kou is the one with the interesting background story. While Futaba's personality change early in the story, the development of Kou happens gradually, his story unfolding a little at a time, his heart opening ever so slowly. It is Kou that will make you laugh, it is Kou that will make you cry. \\n\\n\r\nAo Haru Ride is, in truth, an anime about Kou's development. An anime about how love can hurt you, change you, and how being loved a new may enable you to change again. \\n\\n\r\nAo Haru Ride is an emotional journey. It is not the plot but the characters and their strong feelings that will keep you glued to the screen. It is the characters' growth as persons that makes AHR worth a watch. Overall, AHR is an enjoyable series if you like a romantic story with good characters and a nice amount of comedy. I'm personally a big fan (of the manga also), so I enjoyed the series loads. I do not, however, count take enjoyment into account when making reviews. \\n\\n\r\nOverall AHR scored:\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nArt:7\\n\r\nSound:8\\n\r\nCharacter:9\\n\r\nOverall:  7.75\\n\r\nAHR deserves something in between 7 and 8, depending on your relationship with the genre. \\n",

            "content": "\u201cBut I think it\u2019s natural that not everything you try will go well, right? So, I\u2019m gonna start again from scratch.\u201d\r\n-Yoshioka Futaba\r\nLook at me, I\u2019m stepping out on a limb again.  Ao Haru Ride is not a show I would typically watch, but I have slowly adapted my tastes to include the romantic genre of anime.  I will add though, Ao Haru Ride would not have been a good show even if romance was my favorite genre.  There are sparks of good writing and character development, but they get utterly squashed by the fact that nothing\u2026 happens in the entire anime.There\u2019s no bizarre twist, no seriously dynamic characters, not much of anything.  The anime is very plain and unfulfilling to watch.  But, nonetheless I\u2019ll dive head-first into my review.\\n\\n\r\nAs previously stated, nothing groundbreaking seems to happen in Ao Haru Ride.  It\u2019s a generic love story archetype with Yoshioka Futaba, a young high-schooler at its center.  She used to be in love with a boy name Kou in middle school, but Kou has changed quite significantly over the past couple of years.  This causes Futaba to mindlessly chase the image of the old Kou while desperately trying to understand the new one.  It does give a pretty good perspective of a teenage girl\u2019s mind, as it often struck me as hilarious with some of the things she would get stressed about etc.  Ever since Futaba was seemingly rejected by Kou in middle school, she changed her appearance and personality to become less attractive.  Now reintroduced to her former lover, Futaba takes on the role of class representative in hopes to get Kou\u2019s attention.  He and a few others follow suit, and there we have our cast of MC\u2019s.  The rest of the characters are written in almost unnecessarily, as this anime almost entirely hinges on Kou and Futaba.\\n\\n\r\nI feel the class representative element could\u2019ve been uniquely incorporated in the show, but it served as nothing more than a small plot device to get the characters acquainted.  The rest of the love story pans out slowly, and uninterestingly.  The climax of the show involves both Futaba and Kou crying with each other, but doesn\u2019t feature a single kiss.  Honestly, even the conclusion of the anime is open-ended.  Did they get together or not?  It\u2019s like the writer of the series was like\u2026. \u201cWho cares if they got together?  It\u2019s all about the ride!\u201d  Except there was no ride at all, just mere attempts at a romance element.  There\u2019s also two random love triangles thrown in the mix to make it worse.  The one with Yuuri, Kou and Futaba seems unrealistic.  I feel it\u2019s not realistic for two high school aged girls to be in love with the same guy and have a friendly rivalry over it.  The writers missed an opportunity for some better writing here.  Also, the one with Murao, Kikuchi and Kou\u2019s brother was entirely unnecessary and only detracted from the main story.  I\u2019m not sure what I expected out of the show as a whole, but certainly it was more than what I got.\\n\\n\r\nYoshioka Futaba is a pretty vanilla MC.  Cute, misunderstood and desperately in love with a boy who appears not to give her the time of day.  She does go through some character growth throughout the series, but nothing groundbreaking.  Kou is a straight asshole, and undoubtedly hold the title for the best character in Ao Haru Ride.  The loss of his mother and distance from his brother and father made his drastic personality change justifiable, and his changes throughout the series are evident by his strange but understandable interactions with Futaba.  Yuuri annoyed the shit out of me, I can\u2019t begin to explain my loathing for her character trope.  No one is that cutesy in the real world.  It just doesn\u2019t work that way, so please stop writing in characters like this.  Pretty please?  Kikuchi existed only as a plot device for Murao, but seeing as to how she only spoke about ten lines in the entire show, he didn\u2019t serve as much.  I liked Murao\u2019s character type but her background or love affair with Tanaka was never explained and left me actually confused.  Tanaka actually seemed kind of creepy in dialogue he shared with Kikuchi with the end, basically saying \u201cso what if I like her?\u201d.  What a creepy dude.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is what originally drew me to this show, especially in the first episode.  It\u2019s actually quite good.  I like the character models a lot; they look quite unique when compared to other shows out recently.  The environments are vivid and drawn exceptionally well, although some of the static scenes with dialogue felt a tad lacking.  And, I think Japan was a tad too windy that year\u2026  I will say, I\u2019m a sucker for the OP of Ao Haru Ride.  It\u2019s actually really good.  Upbeat, cute and fun all describe it, and it made me look forward to the series even more.  Too bad it didn\u2019t quite deliver.  The ED also did well for itself, emulating the overall feel at the end of each episode quite decently.  Voice acting was good, most notably for one of my favorite actors, Yuki Kaji.  He took a slight different approach than in Attack on Titan or Shinsekai Yori.  The rest of the soundtrack was also placed well in the show, and the more dramatic scenes were captured well due to the execution of sound effects.  \\n\\n\r\nI wanted to enjoy Ao Haru Ride, I really did.  The show just had so many things working against it.  A boring and overused story line mixed with mostly bland characters doesn\u2019t give you the recipe for success.  I found myself getting bored at times, and that\u2019s saying a lot with such a short anime.  It would only recommend this to fans of romance animes, and the OST is probably worth downloading as well.  Because of the bad taste in my mouth, it might be awhile until I watch another romance anime, but I understand there are far better shows in the genre.  Thanks again for reading!       \\n",

It was very clear and detailed, and wasn't blurry. \r\n[SOUND] - 10/10\r\n-----------\r\nThe voice actors and actresses did a fantastic job of showing the character's true colors and personality, adding that the background sound and music fitted in very well with the scene and moments. \r\n[CHARACTERS] - 9/10\r\n--------------------\r\nThe mysterious background and personalityin Mabuchi really made me curious on who he really was, and made me want to keep watching the anime until I found out. At that point, I was just curious on how it turned out between Mabuchi, Yoshioka, and Yuuri, and made me want to watch the anime until the very end. Although, even though I shouldn't judge a character by their appearances (and this is only my opinion), I was hoping that Yoshioka would be a little more graceful looking, although she was still very appealing when she was embarrassed or when she has made a mistake. \\n\\n\r\n[ENJOYMENT] - 8/10\\n\r\n------------------\\n\r\nLike I said earlier, even though this anime had many comedic and cute scenes, I was really hoping for more romance between Mabuchi and Yoshioka at the end of the anime. I was also really expecting that there would be a lot of tension between Yoshioka and Mabuchi's outside of school friends. \\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL] - 9/10\\n\r\n-----------------\\n\r\nThis anime was very good, and I would totally watch it again.\\n\\n\r\nFINAL SCORE: \\n\r\n9/10",

It sure has been an enjoyable Spring Ride for all of us who have witnessed it, I'm sure. \r\n[STORY: 9/10]\r\nThis isn't like any of your typical shoujo franchise, where the girl spends more than half the series contemplating about her feelings and trying to choose between guys. What's kind of different for this, is that the concept of 'friendship' is thrown into the mix. Because having a great bunch of pals to hang out with, is comparable tohaving a great guy to, right? While romance seems to be the main concentrated genre for this series, I feel that on top on that friendship is the one driving the plot on. \\n\\n\r\n[CHARACTER: 9/10]\\n\r\nThis series features a group of five friends, with all five having seemingly different personalities and thinking processes, which makes way for great character development as we see them mix together. Also, nothing makes character development any better and more obvious than... a touching, heart-warming backstory. I won't spoil it, but the main dude's backstory was one heck of a tear-jerker for me. \\n\\n\r\n[ENJOYMENT: 8/10]\\n\r\nI would've given this a 9 or 10 if not for something I find rather annoying after watching/reading quite a few of these - girls crying. But no worries, because other than that I pretty much enjoyed this on a whole. While there were great emotional moments, there were also comical elements added into the series which made it seem more lively. And the expressions on the characters' faces at times never fail to crack me up. \\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL: 9/10]\\n\r\nSo there you have it. Emotional scenes, emotional quotes said to each other, and it has got a pretty decent soundtrack as well. Wait no longer and just check this series out. It'll be worth your time :D",

High school kids going through relatable struggles. what else would my 300lb ass want from a cartoon?\r\n  Music was really simple but worked so well at climatic points of the show. Just generally really well put together.\r\nBut many shows do this. So what makes this show standout from the others? Not too much i'd say. its just that; a short and sweet show about two characters which should have been, but werent. Its the most cookie cutter plot but it was done well. For that reason i cant rate it as high as i wanted but i would thoroughly recommend it to those that like this genre.\\n\\n\r\nThere were only a few weaknesses of the show. Most contributing to its length. Being short and sweet is a double edged sword with character development. I was pretty disappointed wiht the lack of development of the second love triangle murao-energetic guy ( anime so short i dont even remember his name) - and tanaka sensei. At 12 episodes long it might have been better to cut this triangle out completely but im sure that would have made the manga purists tip their fedora violently. \\n\r\nThe second thing would be the lack of closure i got from the ending. It really probably was a character development story rather than a relationship story. They teased the relationship so wonderfully and i me, being a sucker for cartoon romances of fictional characters in a foreign country, wanted it so bad.",

            "content": "Now fair warning, I\u2019ve made a decent amount of reviews but I\u2019ve never gotten the courage to actually post one. So basically this is my first public and written review of an anime.\r\nBlue Spring Ride otherwise known as Ao Haru Ride was a journey that I couldn\u2019t get enough of. I waited till the series ended to start watching so I didn\u2019t have to deal with the painful feeling of waiting a whole week for another episode.\r\nStory: 8.3\r\nThe story starts out as your typical romance/love story where both characters develop feelings for one another. One leaves for a couple years, and comes back for themto meet again. At this point, you\u2019d think that both parties would admit their feelings and start being together, but well at this point this is where the clich\u00e9 stuff stops. Instead both parties somewhat resent each other\u2019s new personalities and character traits. At this point, the female lead Yoshioka Futaba struggles to either bring back the male lead Mabuchi Kou\u2019s old self or accept the person he\u2019s become.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s basically the whole synopsis. The anime has its cute, sad and funny moments and is enjoyable to laugh, cry and smile about. Character development plays a huge part in this anime as well. Watching characters grow is so entertaining to watch, I enjoyed the non-romantic personality plots that the characters had to grow through to become a \u201cbetter person\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9.1\\n\\n\r\nAs I said, character development is a huge part of this anime. Every character has its own little struggles and issues to deal with throughout the anime and watching them connect with each other and fight their way through every problem proves how detailed this show is. Our male lead Mabuchi Kou at first looked like a typical slacker that didn\u2019t give a **** about his life and other people but it\u2019s way more than just that.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime goes through the monologue and thoughts of the female lead making her the bigger main character and honestly, I related to her character so much\u2026AND IM A GUY LOL. But anyways, the characters are something that really shined through with the anime and the connection I had with them was really strong and I hope you have the same too.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 7.5\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m not the best at critiquing animation and how the show looks mainly because it doesn\u2019t make as big of a difference. This show has a similar art style to Lovely Complex but the animation is Lovely Complex seemed really outdated which lead me to stop watching the show (please don\u2019t hate me) but think of Blue Spring Ride as a \u201cpolished\u201d version of that art style. Everything seems clear. The characters, backgrounds and settings were done really well but honestly I don\u2019t have the ability to access something like that.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8.5\\n\\n\r\nI liked the music in this show. Just like animation, I\u2019m not someone who judges music that well but I do focus on if it interprets the feel of the story well and indeed it does. It does a great job in emphasizing what the character is feeling and draws you in even more to the happy, sad and funny moments. The character voices matched the character models as well. I didn\u2019t have any problem with the voices either.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9.4\\n\\n\r\nOn my reviews, I don\u2019t like adding in my personal score into my final verdict because it\u2019s like adding in my bias opinion. This show I loved a lot and I considerably loved how some of the character issues connected to my issues I\u2019ve had as well. I loved it and actually currently I\u2019m on the second half of the episode. But anyways all I can say is that if you enjoy romance, drama, some funny moments and TONS OF CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT, you\u2019re going to love this show. I also love how they added room for a second season (which probably won't happen however) :(\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict:\\n\\n\r\n8/10 which means:\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyable, detailed, beautiful to ears and eyes.\\n\\n\r\nWhat truly brought it down was that fewer supporting characters getting a plot after all that potential development.\\n\\n\r\nRecommendations: \\n\\n\r\nLovely Complex for its similar art style and love/romance story\\n\\n\r\nKimikiss Pure Rouge: Similar situation in story but roles reversed and WAY more focus on supporting roles.\\n",

            "content": "I decided to watch this after seeing a preview for the live action and it sort of piqued my interest. Never read the manga before watching this so I had nothing to compare it to. Overall, I was very pleased.\r\nThe story is something simple, yet something that catches your attention. We all have those moments we regret, those moments we want to go back in time and change. Futaba wants to change the moment when she wasn't able to properly confess to her middle school crush. But, she gets a second chance when she meets him again in high school. Trust me, the story isa lot better than the description given. The anime does have some cliche elements, but it tells it in a way that's realistic (or at least more realistic than other anime). I don't watch much anime, but I really appreciated the thoughts narrated by Futaba. I was thinking to myself, that's probably what I would be thinking too if that happened to me. Sometimes it feels that the anime moves a little slowly, but everything in the anime is done for a reason, whether it be to help Futaba realize her feelings or mustering up needed courage, or Kou's little acts of kindness shining through his tough exterior.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is excellent. It really grows on you, especially when played during the romantic/sad/important scenes. The song \"I Wish\" by Chelsy is such a great insert song for this anime! It brings the feels!!! The music really sets the atmosphere and is played at the right time for the right occasion.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are what really make this anime. I think some of the other characters can be developed more, but I really like the development of Kou and Futaba (even when reading the manga after finishing this anime, I still felt the same way). Kou is my favorite character, so I'll just write about him. Kou was the one who really drew me into the story, because he had an air of mystery that surrounded him. He used to be a nice, friendly guy in middle school but now is a cold, mean guy in high school. I really wanted to find out why and what happened to him. He was interesting because what he said and did were completely 2 different things. I'll say that Kou's character is a tragic one. Sometimes manga authors may try too hard to make a character be a tragic one, and angst level doesn't match up (usually too much angst for something minimal). Or, they may tell his/her story in a way that doesn't make a whole lot of sense and the tragedy is lost. Kou is not that though. The anime goes into his past and explains it all. It's really sad and made me actually sympathize with him (doesn't happen too often with me and fictional characters). His voice actor did such a great job conveying the emotions needed, plus having a super cool & sexy voice haha. The voice suited the image very much!\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is a very good anime to watch. There are funny moments, sweet moments, sad moments. For those who really want an anime with some substance, you will not be wasting your time with this one! I really hope that there is a season 2.",

A big plus for me was finally watching a romance anime where heroine isn't tsundere, and the main male interest isn't a nosebleeding, over the top shy guy, like all romance lovers are so used to. In just 12(+2 OVA) episodes I felt veryconnected to the main 3 characters who  make up our triangle. The other members of the cast are also pretty interesting, but are not really the focus point in this season. \\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nA warm, charming and also touching, character driven romance/SoL anime. There will not be hysterical laughs, but some. I would definately reccomend this anime. 8/10. \\n\\n\r\n(Minor spoiler) I will not spoil plot or story elements. I will just give my opinion on the continuation of the series in manga form. \\n\\n\r\nIf you continue with the manga or there is a 2nd season, you'll come even closer to the other characters aswell. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending of the anime is ok, but it'll leave you wanting some fullfillment. I have already mentioned that it continues in manga form and so I thought I would share my opinion on the further developements for those who need to complete a show once they watch it. The anime stops after about 16 chapters of the manga. But there's 49 chapters. So needless to say, there is alot more happening. Like several other manga romances, I feel like the roller coaster might have a couple of ups and downs too much. I liked the ending, but I feel like the last 7-8 chapters might have been rushed a bit. \\n\\n",

The storyline wasn't shockingly different from most shoujo anime, but each scene and arc were just beautifully executed, nothing was too over-the-top, and the interactions between the characters seriously moved me (and I have to admit, I am not easily moved!)\r\nArt - 9\r\nBeautiful animation, use of water colours makes everything look very warm and dreamy. Lines are crisp and sharp, colours are vibrant. \r\nSound - 8\r\nBeautiful BG music containing some piano and strings, as the main theme soundtrackwhere appropriate, the music really emphasizes the emotions of the characters or atmosphere of particular scenes. Voice actors did a fantastic job portraying the characters, voices were really soothing and never annoying. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 9\\n\r\nAlthough the characters may seem a little typical, all had individual traits that made them a little unique from other shoujo anime or mangas. The main heroine possesses a strong character and for once is not always clumsy. The only thing that I would have liked the anime to highlight more was why she became so hateful of men. The main male character is portrayed kinder in this anime, the chemistry between the two characters are unbelievably heartwarming to watch - nothing is over-the-top, the interactions between them are very natural. \\n\\n\r\nI absolutely recommend this to anyone looking for something heartwarming or cute to watch! Please give this a go. You won't be disappointed. :)",

Probably due to its restricted length, the anime didn't cover as much psychological development and didn't include some very important characters, which I found was rather disappointing for these characters contributed a lot to the story. Then again, this is my personal opinion. Many people who have watched the anime found it very good. Had I not already read the manga, I would say that this anime is very refreshing, not cliche and very cute.  The overall plot is very good, the story is interesting. The art is nice and the voices sound genuine.",

            "content": "If you're not much of a shoujo anime fan, it's better to just stay away. It's basically a chick who had feelings for a guy when they were in middle school then he left and when he came back, she fell again. If you are a shoujo fan, it's not as ridiculous as Special A, it's a little more realistic. But it's not as heavy as Bokura ga Ita, it's definitely more innocent when it comes to love. Although, the characters back stories are definitely korean/japanese drama worthy, (can't tell you why, you'll have to watch it.) What really sets it apart from other animeis its pacing. No one appreciates good pacing more than me. If it's too slow, you get bored; too fast, you get unattached or confused. They do a good job of introducing elements just enough to keep you watching the next episode.\\n\\n\r\nStory is very typical, but on a shoujo scale it'd be a solid 9 atleast. A shoujo 9 because it can make your heart flutter. A bunch of loner girls becoming friends then very subtly and quietly their love lives unfolds, it's very innocent and lovely and straightforward. If you like shoujo on the innocent side this is for you. Just watch the first episode and immediately you will root for them and find out there is more to the story, that people change and so does their feelings... or does it?! Ah the suspense. *swoon*\\n\\n\r\nArt is pretty, up to date, and clean. It didn't try to be too unique which I appreciated, but the downfall would be is that if I saw a particular screen shot of this anime on a random site, the chances are slim I'd figure out it's Ao Haru Ride right away. But that doesn't matter at all.\\n\\n\r\nSound, tbh, I didn't pay attention to bgm or if it even had any but I rarely skipped the opening song, I reckon it adds to the overall feel of the anime, \"the joy and innocence of young love.\" But I will say this, EVERY TIME there is a serious moment between the mains, there is this ONE song that always always plays. You will know which one I'm talking about, trust me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Oh that main girl's hair, I could not get over how feral she looked, but I realized that she's trying to be as unladylike as possible. I was genuinely hoping she would slowly find her old self again and allow herself to be pretty. Why does it matter? Am I just shallow? No it's because in the anime, it really seemed like she was living a lie just so people would like her. Although it's nice she made friends whatever version of herself she is now, which is what counts and made it heartwarming because she moves forward(not backwards despite this anime being heavy with flashbacks) It would be an exciting development.\\n\\n\r\nThe main guy is really interesting, smart, very kind, good looking and cool because he keeps things to himself. But that's the mystery, we feel like we need to know what's in his heart, he immediately admitted he loved her in the first episode, but as he said, that guy is long dead and that she should give up. But deep in our hearts, we really don't want her to give up. We see glimmers of hope and we clench onto it harder than a handbag in a bad neighborhood.\\n\r\nThe support characters are not annoying and are actually very supportive, loyal people.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I already covered most of it in the characters section. But yeah, what really set it apart from other anime is that it had great pacing, we get her back story and even the guy's back story in the second half, and the relationships and developments of them and everybody else are evenly spread throughout the whole thing. There are always things in each episode that made you go, \"woah yup that happened, let's go watch the next one.\" This is all in just 12 episodes, no time for boring stuff.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I think it's a very decent anime. It's not outrageous so it'd be perfect for a Japanese drama(maybe even a Korean drama if they gave it an antagonist, the anime in 12 episodes did not introduce one. In their defence, why try stop nothing? The guy doesn't wanna love yet, what's the antagonist gonna do at this point? So yeah I think it was a good move for the anime.) \\n\\n\r\nComplete disclaimer: I didn't read the manga, so whether or not it did it justice, I wouldn't be able to tell you, but I can honestly say that if someone like me(who-stayed-away-from-shoujo-anime-for-a-couple-of-years-because-seeing-fictional-people-having-a-better-love-life-than-me-really-sucked) finished it, then it's completely watchable. I'll be honest I stopped watching at episode 6 then picked up again after a couple of months then finished it in ONE DAY! See that's something!\\n\\n\r\nI'm giving it an 8.5/10. I admit it is pretty high for an anime like this but it was exactly what I felt I was looking for in a shoujo anime and it didn't completely let me down. Good looking, dependable characters that develops throughout the anime. They didn't make me tear my hair out. And trust me, even popular anime like Tokyo Ghoul and Deadman Wonderland had characters that made me want to tear it out. (Remembering those other characters are actually making me want to give Ao Haru Ride a 10/10 instead, but I think an 8.5 would be fair enough for now.)",

This show is a bit of a mixed bag, you get wonderful characters being idiots to each other in what should really be a beautiful story. Ao Haru Ride sits somewhere between Say I Love You and Kimi ni Todoke. Its darker than Kimi ni Todoke but not quite to the Say I Love You level. Ultimately, its probably a bit more realistic and maybe that's why its harder to take. I think the story went where it needed to, but the missed opportunities of the characters themselves leaves alot to be desired. However, I found this to be a different side of good writing and really enjoyed the show. A second season would be great, but as it stands its a bit heavy all together and may not be what your looking for. I would recommend My Little Monster as a comedy alternative with a similar feel.",

Cute lyrics, the Beat, and the Wonderful Chorus was Amazingly good also \"Blue\" by Fujifabric as the ED.\\n\\n\r\nOn the Background Music, \"I will\" by Chelsy fits the Scenes. The scenes where it is serious drama, The BM adds a Light Atmosphere. Really light and Fluffy.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the Voice acting, The voice Actors and the Voice Actresses really fit the Characters, So good. I'll give it a 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nWell, I enjoyed the Characters well But Sometimes I dont Like kou.

            "content": "I'm glad i waited for this anime to finish first before i started watching it. I enjoyed this so much that i was happy that i could watch it almost in one day.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nA really beautiful but maybe a bit sad story about a boy with many problems in his life, how he started to think about the world, and how he managed to live with these problems. It was shown very realistic and normal that i almost saw myself in this character. This anime can really give you feels if you can understand it just a little bit. It shows that even a maleperson can be sad, have problems, cry and get hurt, but that there is always a way to get along with that, that everything is possible only if you try it. It also shows that you shouldn't judge someone just because he is a bit cold, maybe it's a kind person but fears to get hurt, and shuts himself behind a double locked door.\\n\r\nFor everyone who thinks man are without emotions - watch this anime and learn it better.\\n\r\nFor everyone who knows a bit about it, and feels the same way as a man - watch it, it will make you understand YOURSELF even better.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThis story i mentioned wouldn't be that good if there weren't such nice characters in it. The characters showed emotions in a bit different way, in a cute and beautiful way, and that's what made me love them so much. I really wish i could meet such nice people in my life too, we all need people like that, we all need friends. Ok i got carried away, sorry.\\n\r\nSuch lovely characters, can't really complain about it.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThere actually wasn't really anything special, there was not really a song i memorized or that is stuck into my head or something, it's just that the anime had really beautiful background music which made the drama and the romance parts even better, and I think that's why the background music exist.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI love the animation at the Opening theme, such lovely colors, i could watch it the whole day. Even the animation in the anime itself was really nice, nice shaped character faces and really lovely embracing moments that are really well made. Loved it :)",

            "content": "Ao Haru Ride is one of the most popular shoujo manga publishing at the moment. For that (and knowing how as the variety of this genre decreases shoujo titles fall more into typical) I supposed this one would be different. When an anime adaptation was announced I took it as a good opportunity to see why this one story was special. And it turned out, it wasn't. \r\nThe story starts out fine. The concept is not anything original but the two main protagonists reencountering again being so different to how they were in the past, and unknowing all that has happened to each other duringthat time had some potential for a ride of feelings. And it was close during the first three episodes, especially because the female protagonist's personality is so lively and straight forward that her actions easily differed from the well-known indecision and passivity that are characteristic in the heroines of numerous romance series. But very early on the episodes fill up with the typical school and friendship events and problems, and the story soon loses its focus.\\n\\n\r\nThe following most important character after the female protagonist Futaba is Kou, the boy she had not seen for years and now attends her same high school as it turns out. The new Kou is, like the serious Murao states in several of her very scarce dialogues, a \"brat\". We do get to know the experiences that affected him enough to change his personality but these do not make him any more likeable. And I do not mean being dislikeable has to be a negative characteristic: when developed well, rebellious, mysterious or dark characters can be the most interesting and original, but Kou is none of that and he's simply ill-mannered. His actions do not provide much new to the plot, his beginning in the story is good enough to allow him to make a difference but he doesn't develop and just sulks in resentment all along. Which brings me back to Futaba, the personality of hers I found distinctive at first for a shoujo series, turns foolish and clich\u00e9d as soon as she falls in love.\\n\\n\r\nStill the worst developed characters are the other three friends of the group: they have the importance of a flower pot to the story. Makita gets part of the focus for a couple of episodes but Murao and Kominato could have easily been invisible. Given they little participation these two seem to be present in the series only to fill up the archetypes of quiet, cold girl and noisy, blatant boy. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation is average concerning the fluidity and art of the backgrounds (excluding the slightly rarest watercolour style used during flashbacks; too fuzzy) but character design is very inconsistent. The manga art looks good, so do the anime covers and even the key visuals released before the series started airing are good enough, but once animated the proportions and expressions are too unstable and in many scenes their faces become either unrecognizable or unattractive. Fortunately this does not happen constantly. \\n\r\nThere isn't much to say about sound: the opening and ending themes are average or fine depending on tastes, soundtrack is to be somewhat noticeable whilst watching and then forgotten right afterwards (like it happens with most anime OSTs) and seiyuus are good at accomplishing the expected voices that fit the stereotyped personalities. \\n\\n\r\nAo Haru Ride wasn't especially boring but it's a series that doesn't offer anything new, and one of those series where little relevant happens when you look back on it: something that stays in mind is how right before the conclusion the show throws in a (predictable) final hook to keep the audience following the upcoming events. This season of 12 episodes covers only 14 of the +40 chapters the manga currently has so sequels are to be expected.\\n\r\nDue to my discrepancies with the characters I barely found any scenes touching or disclosing as they themselves apparently did, but I still do not regret having watched the anime. It gives me a good idea of how generic content keeps on being labelled as special when it gets popular and how success certainly isn\u2019t correlated to uniqueness.   \\n\\n\r\nOverall Blue Spring Ride has average sound, average animation, decent enjoyment and development below average. So don\u2019t watch it if you\u2019re looking for an overall good series, unless like me, you want to get an idea of the manga without reading it. \\n",

            "content": "Standard high school Shojo, but an unusually good one. Very slow paced with sensible and not the slightest bit over-the-top characters. The story is entirely character-driven and feels 100% plausible and realistic. The dialogue is coherent, makes sense and works well as a medium for the cast to drive the story forward. Graphics are a fair bit above average and character design is spot on. \r\nThis could have been a real masterpiece if there was a wee bit more happening. As it is, it is a heartwarming feel-good slice of cousyness and reminiscing. And I'm totally fine with that. But if Ao Haru ride wouldhave any ambition to be the next Bokura ga ita or Kimi ga nozomu eien, they should have put a bit more pressure on the gas, and probably extended the show with more episodes in the process.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, a great but harmless shojo.",

Just not my tune, but still the music gives vibes for the scenes.\r\nCharacter - 6/10\r\nCharacters are flawed but realistic to me. Its just that some backstories of the charactersare somewhat missing. It focused only on the MC's stories that they forgot the other secondary characters to involve. Lacks a definite ending for some characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8/10\\n\r\nI enjoyed watching it, and the \"feels\" I got from this anime somewhat resembles reality.",

            "content": "*Note: this review does not take into consideration the manga, which has completed*\r\nSometimes, it doesn't hurt to use tried-and-tested formulas for your stories. But when writers do that, they can fall into a too predictable story line, which will make the show feel unoriginal. What makes a \"predictable\" story stand out from its peers is a strong cast of characters that can make you forget that you are watching a cookie-cutter anime.\r\nAo Haru Ride utilizes a typical shoujo story formula. The story begins with our female lead, Yoshioka, when she was in middle school. During that time, she set her eyes on a boy namedTanaka Kou. However, due to certain circumstances, Kou had to move away. Three years later (I think), Tanaka comes back but goes by a different name and Yoshioka sets out to see if she still has the same feelings for him as she did in middle school.  This is a pretty generic story line and as you watch it, it's pretty predictable where the story goes. There are a few curveballs here and there but not so much that you lose sight of the general direction the story is heading in. Of course, there are comedic moments in the show and it's executed fairly well. They mainly appear right after a very tense moment, which leaves a more relieved atmosphere and a few chuckles at the same time. One aspect that I thought makes Ao Haru Ride stand out is that it portrays the relationship between the characters very realistically. There are no over-the-top sequences where the knight in shining armour comes and saves the damsel in distress. It's done more subtly and that's what makes the anime very charming. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Ao Haru Ride are not particularly special. Yoshioka is a boisterous and kind of gluttonous girl while Kou is the dark and mysterious but yet very dreamy guy. Indeed, these characters are pretty generic but the story develops in a way such that you can't help but begin rooting for Yoshioka to get her man. I think this is one aspect that makes Ao Haru Ride stand out amongst the other shoujo anime. The characters are definitely very likable. There are a few side characters but we don't get to know them really well so they are really just the supporting actors. But it makes it all the more better because we get to see more of the romance between our two MCs, Yoshioka and Kou!\\n\\n\r\nI thought the artwork in the anime was really cool. The character designs slightly resemble that of Kimi ni Todoke but in Ao Haru Ride,  the characters seemed to be drawn more realistically. I really enjoyed the vivid colours in the anime especially when a character has a flashback sequence. In those scenes, soft and almost impressionistic colours dominate the screen and really sets a dreamy and pleasant atmosphere. The comedic sequences are also nicely drawn but not a lot of standout artwork in that respect.\\n\\n\r\nThe music of Ao Haru Ride is definitely very noteworthy. The OST is composed mostly of strings, piano, and vocals. Music is a pretty heavy element in this anime in that most scenes, especially the romantic ones, the music really swells up to build the atmosphere. It can provide for some tissue box moments as well. The soundtrack definitely made the anime come to life. The OP is pretty catchy and oftentimes, I find myself humming the melody!\\n\\n\r\nAo Haru Ride is without a doubt an enjoyable anime. I would dock it a point or two because the ending of the anime feels unresolved (evidently, it's not likely to build a good love story with only 13 episodes). Otherwise, Ao Haru Ride is a very heartwarming tale with very tender love scenes that will make you like one character or another. If you enjoy watching shoujo anime, Ao Haru Ride is definitely one to watch. If you don't typically watch them, still, give this one a try. You may find yourself reading the manga to find out more\u2026\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review! Drop me a comment if you liked or disliked the anime or if you want to see season 2 of Ao Haru Ride! I would love to hear from you!",

            "content": "First things first: this isn't a romance. It has romantic elements to it, but at the end of the day, this anime is about friendship and overcoming loneliness. That's not a bad thing, by any means, but just be prepared for that if you watch this.\r\nI think the story is really strong with this anime. It teaches a lot about personal struggles and the hardships of opening up to people. The characters were written very well, especially Kou. His personality specifically was the one I enjoyed the most because he had a lot of development potential.\r\nThe humor in this anime is quite charming, as well,I think. It fits the mood of the series nicely because it isn't too cheap or over exaggerated. Another thing to love about this anime was the art style. The character designs were good, but the environments and flashback art styles were really nice as well. \\n\\n\r\nThe only bad thing I could say about this anime is that it kind of switched courses halfway through. It started off as a romance and then it turned into a story about saving this lonely boy that isolates himself. Had I known that from the beginning, I think I would've enjoyed the story to its fullest.\\n\\n\r\nI'd still recommend it to people as it's a heartwarming story that I'm sure had a lot to glean for a lot of people, but keep the story change in mind as you watch it so you aren't disappointed by anything. I don't know if I'll return to it in the future, but I'm certainly happy I watched it.",

            "content": "Short and sweet review of this romance anime. If you're looking for major spoilers and a full review, look elsewhere. If you know what to expect from romance animes and are just looking for your next one to watch, please read on.\r\nThis could have been one of the best romance/shoujo anime's I've watched, except for one main issue: about 3/5 of the way through the season, they forgot they were a romance anime.\r\nFor some reason, the story and characters were progressing great: you have your main character trying to get to know her middle-school crush again after a long absence, but he came back damagedby some unknown event (eventually revealed near the end of the show). One of the MC's friends falls for him too, etc etc you know the story. Thing is, it was really good. The MC was interesting and the first few episodes are really captivating.\\n\\n\r\nBut for some reason, right when things should be getting good, the show turns into \"let's have every character start to like this guy and want to help him get good grades in school\".\\n\\n\r\nLiterally, I can't be more serious. It barely resembles a romance/shoujo by the end of the show, providing NO RESOLUTION to the romance between the MC's, and no real closure. It goes from \"I used to love him\" to \"I think I still love him\" to \"I definitely love him\" to \"Oh no someone else loves him too!\" to \"Let's get him good grades by studying!\" and then ends. Even more infuriating, it forces a couple very high-tension sexual/emotional scenes between the two MC's, but has absolutely no payoff and only serves to further the storyline about the love interest's reason for being damaged. The show ends before any romance actually happens and before the love interest even learns of the MC's feelings. You don't even get to learn if he actually has feelings for her of a romantic nature. They never even kiss for real.\\n\\n\r\nI have no idea why people love this romance anime so much. Perhaps if you just stop watching after the big reveal of what damaged the MC's love interest, and just pretend they hooked up after that and lived happily ever after, then yeah it's a great anime. But if you watch all the way to the end, you'll be disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nHighlights: Animation, sound, characters, first 4 episodes.\\n\r\nDisappointments: Terrible ending, loss of direction, and bad pacing starting mid-season, culminating in no closure and a different genre almost.",

A bit of romance, a bit of daily life, love triangles and so on and so forth.\r\nSurely I wasn't excepting that kind of a deep story when I dived in this title, the OP of which I randomly found on Youtube the other day.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nThis anime isn't that much about love and romance. It is about normal human feelings, walls, that we put around us, the masks we wear, living an everyday life. This story may lack the sudden turns and a complicated canvas, but it has real tragedy in it.The one-man tragedy, which got me thinking about my own life quite a bit. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nNot much to say about that. Character design was really good. The only thing that did bring some unwanted feelings was the amount of emoticons and all such things. I think, this title could be better off without them. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nThe music was beatiful. All soundtracks were playing at the right time and totally fitting the atmosphere. OP/ED were both amazing too.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nAll the main characters in this anime feel really human. We all have hard times telling the truth to someone we care for, but some things are needed to be said.\\n\r\nI really felt bad for Cou and was envious of him at the same time. Maybe, because I associate myself with him in practically all the ways possible, but feel like I could be a better person with this guy's attitude. Still, he was really lucky he had a girl, that 'wanted to be included'. Plus, he is the author the phrase 'friends in name only', which everyone has in their minds, but no one ever says.\\n\r\nYoshioka was really annoying and sloppy all the time, but I admire her bravery and energy. Wish I had a girlfriend like this, hah.\\n\r\nOther guys were pretty good too, but no that much worth speaking about.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nThis anime really took me over very quickly. I just breathed in and clicked play... and it was already over. Still, it sure left a lot of things to think about, and I'm grateful for that.\\n\\n\r\nOveral: 9/10\\n\\n",

Does not necessarily mean that this is a bad thing, but except for audiences who are specifically looking for this kind of story, anime may not be quite valuable to behold.Every incident in the whole story can always be easily guessed, was never able to give any surprises that would lead one to wonder whatwill happen next, and he also does not offer anything really new tomost simply inviting curiosity know. Actually, occasionally there are moments that touch and even has the potential to inspire when he put aside for a moment the topic around love and focus more on friendship Futaba and Yuuri, but because the frequency is too rarely, an outline of this anime is only going to appear as a romantic story very flat.",

Many of the other characters where good but because of the fact that this is supposed to be a romance with Kou being the male lead and him being just a terrible person, this does deserve the low rating.\r\n-Good Points-\r\nThe female characters had lost of depth to them, the main girls friends weren't just \"the main girls friends\" they had their own personality to them. \r\nArt was wonderful, it wasn't to out there with its own style that is got to distracting but it was different enough that you couldpick it out form a crowd of romance animes\\n\\n\r\n-Bad points-\\n\r\nNow instead of \"Bad points\" I should just say Kou. He was the worst person of the show. He was constantly rude the the main girl (to the point of calling her fat and ugly to her face in front of his friends) and all around he was just an asshole to everyone, worst part is that the creator tried to rub it off with \"ohh his mother is dead hes having a hard time thats why hes a total cunt so its ok\". And look it doesnt matter what has happened to you in life you dont have the right to treat people the way he does.\\n\r\nAgain this is the character that or main character is supposed to love and care for and all he does is treat he badly. How a i (and others) supposed to watch a show that abut two people getting together when i want one of them to just tell the other to never speek to her again?\\n\\n\r\nSo look all in all if you have a thing for guys who treat everyone (not just girls) like dirt then you got yourself a new boo and is name is Kou, I'm sure no one else wants him.",

            "content": "I guess I must be tsundere towards shoujo in general, rather than plain masochistic. The reason? I tend to dislike the genre because of all those generic heroines, bastard love interests and utterly pointless love triangles among countless other things. Yet because of series like Natsume Yuujinchou or Lovely Complex I keep torturing myself through all that wangst and forced drama. And, admittedly, it's worth it more often than not. Such is the case with Ao Haru Ride.\r\nThe premise is nothing out of the common--the two main characters used to like each other during middle school, got separated and then found each other again yearslater. However, they had changed, and not for the better. The female lead, Futaba, has drastically altered her persona in order to be accepted. The male lead, Kou, has become a cold, condescending asshole as a shield against the rest of the world. It's no wonder they initially dislike each other.\\n\\n\r\nMostly.\\n\\n\r\nSurprisingly, Futaba is quite likeable from the beginning. From what I've read, she's relatable enough for people to root for her from the very beginning. In my case, I mostly relate to Kou, but that's because I relate to asshole male leads in general. Ironically.\\n\r\nSpeaking of which, Kou turned out to be intriguing from the beginning as well, mostly because, like Futaba, he does have depth beneath the usual archetype. Kou's sadness is palpable the way Futaba's own loneliness is, which make them all the more real.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, sans Kou's older brother, the rest of the cast seems fairly dull not because they lack screentime, but because they seem closer to their own archetypes than the main leads. We get the lone wolf, Murao, the girly sweetie-pie, Yuuri, and the overly-energetic dude, Kominato. Their actions and thoughts are too predictable which is disappointing because they do have potential.\\n\\n\r\nIf I were to mention the anime's highlight... it would be the art. Those watercolor backgrounds can be plain spectacular at times, and the animation, along with the soundtrack, effectively conveys an atmosphere fitting the story's themes. The art style has to be one of my favorite among shoujo. It's detailed without being over-the-top and very distinctive as well. In fact, I may or may not have initially read the manga because of the art. It would've been among my top 20 had an idiotic character not been introduced halfway just for drama, apparently. But that's another story.\\n\\n\r\nAo Haru Ride is not groundbreaking, but it's good. It does try to convey a message rather than just mindlessly entertain. The characters do grow and mature, Kou even more so than Futaba herself. There's a fair share of genuinely tender scenes and a couple that really did 'tug at my heartstrings'. I'd consider it above average, but not among the best of the genre. Except for the art. I'm in love with the art. Damn Sugisaka Io.",

            "content": "Plot and Story Line\r\nIt's the first time that the MAL community rated an anime exactly as I did. I gave it an 8 (well 7,95 is close). The story is funny, cute, romantic and realistic. I never believed that I would say this one day, but I really enjoyed this romance. I loved it. Now let's get this started...\r\nTo the plot.\r\nIt's a fantastic story that, as I believe, happened to most of us at least once in a similar way. There is that cute and nice girl in the middle school called Futaba Yoshioka. She is very popular among the guys in her class andthey really like her, but the girls don't. \"Jealous girlies\". She was alone most of the time, until that one rainy day when she met Kou Tanaka in a shrine where both of them tried to find shelter from the rain. Of curse that event was followed by a couple of other cute and precious memories and they even made plans  for meeting at the Summer Festival. Unfortunately Kou never showed up and literary \\n\r\ndisappeared  afterwards. \\n\r\nTime passed and Futaba is now a high school student with a complete different attitude and personality. She had enough of being alone all the time and now she gave up her cuteness and femininity so the girls don't become jealous again. Tomboyish  and with a disheveled look she encounters the only guy she ever loved, again. Now with a life turned upside down she tries to find her place where she belongs to. \\n\\n\r\nWith a set plot, let's discuss. The Story Line.  \\n\\n\r\nWhere does the strength of Ao Haru Ride lie? In my opinion it is the background story of Kou. As always, Rule No.1. \"NO SPOILERS\", but I'll tell you this. The whole first season was mainly focused of Futaba trying to reach the old Kou. All the flashbacks that were woven into the present story were amazing. The makers created an intriguing story in the past, that affects the present, which is also a great love story on its own. So you basically get two parallel story lines in the past that meet in the present. I've always loved\\n\r\n retrospection.   \\n\r\nThe second thing that made me love this anime is the diversity of the mini story lines in the show. It doesn't talk about Futaba's and Kou's relationship alone. There are tons of others, for instance my favorite side story line, the relationship between Kou and his older brother Youichi. And there are many more. I just hope that the makers will soon announce a second season, but for now it doesn't look like that. The manga finished airing in February, 2015, so I'll still keep my fingers crossed. \\n\\n\r\nAnd now, let's just focus on the main story line. The core, let's say. The romance between Kou and Futaba. I hate the romance genre because it is full of cliches and \"I expected that to happen\" situations.  But I'll probably give anime romances a chance. Maybe Clanned, but let's talk about that later. Kou and Futaba. It's not just a silly teenage relationship. It goes from that cute kids love to a serious love, and it's so good. There are so many moments where you have to say: \"Awwww!\". You just have to. It's somehow more realistic and it's not because I am AnimeGirl that caused me love this anime-relationships. They are always so undefined yet clear. They are so cute, and I love cute things. Too bad anime is not real, even love would be much easier. \\n\\n\r\nAs a conclusion, Ao Haru Ride is a fascinating story with an intriguing plot that will keep you on tenterhooks until the last second. There are no plot holes and the story is also smooth without any unnecessary and stupid plot twists. There are always new mini stories that appear, but they slowly make their way into the show. They always appear at the right time to keep you interested till the end. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nGuys, I could really go on talking about the characters the whole night. They are all so special and interesting in their own way. I give it a 10 for uniqueness. But, as always, here are the main two characters of Ao Haru Ride.\\n\\n\r\nFutaba Yoshioka. You have no idea how much this girl reminds me of my-self. I kinda was in a very similar situation at Middle School too. That's so unbelievable. The only difference is that in middle school I tried to hide my true self, while in high school I did the exact opposite. That's why I was happy when Futaba realized that it's not worth being someone else if there are people who accept you exactly how you are. \\n\\n\r\nKou Tanaka or later in the story Kou Mabuchi is the most interesting character in the whole story. I always wanted to know more about him, and luckily the anime reveals his life story, which is believe me or not on e of the best background stories I've ever seen. By the way, I love cats too. He is one of the cool guys acting emotionless while being very sensible and full of emotions on the inside. I love this type of characters because they are always so full of surprises. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\r\nWell, maybe the story isn't, but the animation definitely is a \"As expected\" since the makers of Ao Haru Ride are also the makers of the anime \"Psycho-Pass\" and \"Guilty Crown\" (Check out both of the reviews on my blog). And I hope you have seen the animation of those two. The word BRILLIANT is not enough to describe the stuff that your eyes see when you watch this. I love it, and since I've always found bad animation extremely repelling I was glad that this story came with the animation and style it deserves. \\n\r\nThe idea that I liked the most in Ao Haru Ride is the way they put that watercolor effect in the flashback scenes. Awesome!\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\r\nIf you want to change my opinion about something you really have to have good arguments to convince me. Ao Haru Ride for example really convinced me that romance anime are not bad at all. I loved it. Animation, Story, Plot, Characters. Everything is in its right place. I would really give it a try if you haven't already watched it. \\n\\n\r\nMORE REVIEWS: worldofanimegirl.blogspot.com",

            "content": "Ao Haru Ride gives off a a powerful vibe of excitement that makes you crave for more. While watching this series and waiting every week for a new episode i experience that vibe 80% of the time. As their are some flaws to this series.\r\nStory 10/10 - The story focuses around Yoshioka Futaba's life, an outrageously pretty girl, which is a problem. This problem makes her decide to change her image as a person and her life choices. All before she reunites with an old middle school friend that let me just say, had an impact on her life then and rapidly picks up now.Throughout the series she tries to connect with him emotionally, to understand him. This story may seem like your typical anime love story, and unfortunately it is. But it's with a hint of , \" I wasn't expecting that\" , and little things that makes this anime unique. It paces quickly but that's a good thing about it. The episodes pick up where they left off, kind of like a continuous movie. \\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10- As i never really focus on artwork in anime. This one was eh. It had some nice effects that would catch an eye. All though the artwork does look lazy , like there are things that are missing/ could be improved. But the over all art work was as plain as day.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10- The voice actors fit well with the character's personality. The OP (opening) is very catchy. The tracks throughout the series all though were barely noticeable, as in ,could have been better especially the ending. But the overall sound made a feel at ease and makes you not worried about a character with an annoying voice to come along.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10- These characters are your classic , cheesy,  romance anime characters when it comes down to the personality. But their reaction to certain situations sure caught me off guard. The supporting cast is very important to the story which gives a relaxed feeling since not everything revolves around the main characters. Every character has something of their own. There are some characters to come across in dislike though, but i found that to be the creator's intentions. These characters aren't all unique, their are some flaws in them but that's what makes it even more interesting, to find out what they'll do next.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10- Did i mention every week i couldn't wait for a new episode? Every episode seemed to go by so fast because of the enjoyment i had for it. Theirs moments where you laugh uncontrollably , gasp in awe , and feel embarrassed for the characters like your in the anime yourself. I definitely will remember this series for a long time, and may possibly watch it again. It made me feel so much excitement, it was addicting. All though i don't like how short the series is ( 12 episodes), I feel that there's a huge cliff hanger at the end which puts me unease. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10",

            "content": "One of the problems in the anime industry is that there aren't enought shoujo manga adapations. Another problem is that when those adaptations happen, they are often made incredibly generic. \r\nAo Haru Ride aired during summer 2014 and was composed by 12 episodes + an OAV produced by production I.G. \r\nSTORY: 7/10\r\nThe story starts in a really interesting way. The two main characters, Kou and Futaba (who liked each other in the past), haven't seen each other in years and when they meet again they're incredibly changed. Kou is not the gentle, femmine boy anymore (he's a douche) and Futaba is trying to change herpersonality to fit in. Will Futaba find out about what happend to Kou? What made him change so much? Will she be able to break throught? And most important, will they be able to act like themselves?\\n\r\nThe anime covers the first part of the manga, which is still ongoing, so it obviously ends with an open ending. Even thought the last episodes actually closes the circle that started in the first ep, and it gives a feeling of conclusion.\\n\r\n25 minutes episodes feel like they're 3 minutes long.\\n\r\nWhile the pacing is good, the main problem about the story is that the writers changed too much the original atmosphere in the manga. Futaba's inner monologues and struggles, that are on of the best part in the manga, result almost swallow and boring. The drama didn't have enought impact and Kou is almost made emotionless. I blame that on the\\n\\n\r\nART: 5/10\\n\r\nI may say, the art sometimes looks beautiful, like actually amazing. The backgrounds are fantastic and the colors and palettes are artistic.\\n\r\nBut. There's something i can't forgive, the animations. They are so bad they kill the mood of the story, in a dramatic anime YOU NEED good animations to convey the feelings of the characters. I almost laught when i was supposed to cry cause they were so bad, especially since the manga art is so beautiful. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 8/10\\n\r\nWhile the soundtrack is really nice, and the tracks are memorable, there's an abuse of the track \"i will\" by chelsy, which really gets old after some time. I get it. You love that song. But you can't have 23567 scenes that are supposed to convey different emotions with the same bg track.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 8/10\\n\r\nThis is a characters driven show. Every single persone of the group has something that makes them different and real. They have flaws and they make mistakes and you somehow can really feel them. You know that are real, even if they aren't. You keep rooting for Futaba like she's your sister, you want her to succed. And the great thing is that Kou actually has motivations for his change. It's believable. Their love is believable. At the end of the show you're left wanting more. You want to know what happens next.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 10/10\\n\r\nSeriously. The show has lots of mistakes, it becomes a generico shoujo after the first episodes. But oh my god i wish it had 100 more episodes. From a subjective point of view, this thing really touches your soul. I suggest everyone to keep going with the manga because the best is yet to come.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 7/10\\n\r\nWatch this for a nice shoujo anime. Read the manga for an epic emotional rollercoaster (10/10)",

            "content": "Ao Haru Ride .. a typical love story that can make you ... HOOKED. I don\u00b4t even know why but this anime was really easy to watch..  \r\nA resume about my experience with this anime: \r\n1st episode: Ok .. \r\n3rd episode: This is actually nice, i liked those intense moments \r\n6th episode: Well .. kinda clich\u00ea but at least is fun to watch \r\n9th episode: What a surprise .. i wasn\u00b4t expecting such a nice feeling from this show ... \r\n12th episode + OVA (13th episode) : I wanted more .. even though the end is fine. \r\nStory: 6/10. Maybe the worst point here.It has so many things that simply doesn\u00b4t make any sense. Why Why Why Why .. i was always questioning myself about this anime .. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is not original at all, the setup is not that great as well. The main male character has some dark past .. (this was supposed to be a mystery but as soon as they said in the anime that he had troubles with his life i realized immediately what was the problem .. and i was right). \\n\\n\r\nThis anime sticks too much with clich\u00ea themes and i didn\u00b4t liked it. Anyway the story isn\u00b4t awful. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10. Really interesting art. Well drawn characters and vibrant backgrounds makes the up the mood for the intense moments in the anime. There are tiny problems in terms of detail and depth in the background and in the characters but overall it looks great. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10. Please .. the sound is ... normal for the most part .. weak opening, reasonable ending .. BUT. Well this anime has one of my favourite tracks of all time. It is one of those tracks that you can use everywhere that will make the scene better. Really impressive, i just loved it. I watched this anime 2 months ago and i still hear that track every once in a while only to remember the feeling. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10. So as the story, the characters are pretty much clich\u00ea characters. Even though not having nothing new to show, the couple here is really cute and fun to watch so i think they deserve a chance. Nice reactions, nice dialogues, everything is well done. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10. As i said, this anime is really easy to watch. If you are a big fan of romance I think you will have a good time with this show. Being small only helps. It makes the faster in terms of pace so we don\u00b4t get bored (unlike other romance anime where we have entire episodes dedicated to comedy or exploring any other character that isn\u00b4t relevant, here on Ao Haru Ride they only spend time developing the main characters and their relation.)\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10. This anime worth it's time so I think if you like romance, maybe you should give it a try. If you are not a big fan of romances, then you can leave this one. You won\u00b4t be loosing anything important by not watching this anime. Like I said, it is pretty normal.  \\n",

            "content": "After giving a lot of thought, I finally decided to write a review about this anime.Before I begin, do note that this review is only regarding the anime and not the manga ( which is still running as of today)\r\nStory : 7/10\r\nThe main girl, Yoshioka Futaba, a middle-schooler is depicted as the typical young shoujo school girl.She\u2019s cute, pretty and attracts all the boys with her looks and personality.As a result of this, she isn't very popular amongst the girls and barely has any friends. That is, until she comes across Kou Tanaka. a soft-spoken, gentle guy with whom she gradually develops a friendship. However,after a misunderstanding, their relationship as friends ends when he transfers schools over summer vacation. In high school, her world is turned around once again when she meets Kou again, this time under the name of Kou Mabuchi.  \\n\r\nFast forward 3 years.\\n\r\nFutaba is now no longer feminine and she acts like a complete slob just so that her so called \u2018friends\u2019 don\u2019t leave her and hate her because she doesn\u2019t attract guys anymore. However, he\u2019s changed too, he\u2019s no longer \u2018nice\u2019 or \u2018gentle\u2019 and he\u2019s actually quite silent and mean now. So life carries on after that \u2026 do they still have feelings for each other, do they even remember each other?\\n\r\nThe story is a simple one that is relatable and yet offers a lot of intrigue and suspense.\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThe animation is amazing and Production I.G has done a great job in keeping the original look of the manga, something I haven't seen in other shows lately.\\n\r\nAlthough the show billed as a shoujo romantic comedy ,it\u2019s a pretty basic light coming-of-age in high school tale.\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThe sound is amazing, with a medley of heart-warming and and beautiful songs that would definitely strike a chord.\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\r\nCharacter development is one area I hope that this anime had focused more upon. Apart from the two main characters, not much focus is given on the supporting characters which would have added to more depth and enjoyment in the story.At times, it is one-dimensional and could have been improved a lot.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nFutaba fits the bill perfectly as an awkward lead as she fumbles through her attempts to get closer to Kou and giving us a lot to enjoy as we listen to her thoughts. The anime manages to seamlessly integrate both romance and humour, providing for a fun-filled watch.\\n\r\nOverall: 7.5/10\\n\r\nIt is one of those shows that start off strong, but unnecessary filler through the mid-episodes can be a bother.\\n\r\n Still, Ao Haru Ride breaks beyond the cliches of typical shoujo anime and a master of subtlety, realism, and pacing, not to mention its brilliant use of art style and understanding of human relationships. \\n\r\nIn conclusion:\\n\r\nIf you want to watch a romance anime, watch this show.\\n",

I watched the anime within a two day window, which is pretty good for a high school student, and I read the manga in 3-4 days. I was blown away! The manga had me clinging to every word, just waiting for the next chapter. I'm so excited for chapter 46 to come outthat I can barely sit still anymore. I think I'll probably go insane if I don't get Ao Haru Ride merchandise sometime in the near future. I think this is the most I've ever loved an anime or manga in my entire life and when it ends I think I'm going to cry.\\n\\n\r\nYou can see the same review one the manga page.",

It had really good animation and the story was another big selling point of this anime. Some of its weaknesses in my opinion, like most romance anime involving more than one character liking the same guy. No couple really is formed, but you can probably assume from the way the anime ends, but there's no satisfaction in actually seeing a relationship established. \r\nThis is why I think this anime was worthy of an 8. Main reason being i LOVED the main male character, hemight've seemed a bit cold, but I think his personality was pretty cool. I liked how much all the characters, not just a few, all of the characters evolved throughout the anime. Another big reason i liked this anime was because it reminded me a lot of Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun. A few of the characters looked identical and their personalities were very similar.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is an anime you should check out, definitely worth a go.",

It could have been I started watching it with too high of expectations but I don't think that was the issue.\r\nOver the course of the twelve episodes there is very little plot or development.  The two main characters knew each other from middle school and had mutually liked one another only for Kou (the boy) to suddenly move away after Futaba (the girl) caused an awkward scene after he asked her to go to a festival with him.\r\nWhen Kou returns and Futaba see him she is attached to the pastversion of Kou she knew and tried to apply it to the Kou that had been away from her for 3 years.  The whole anime is about these two and a \"developing romance\" but honestly it was entirely one-sided for about 90% of the series.\\n\\n\r\nKou's hidden niceness makes it appear as though he has affections early on but Futaba's character explains it best when she states that he is just nice though he tries to act as though he doesn't care because he is scared.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are looking for a romance anime that has no real romantic closure at the end this would be an anime to watch.  I can only hope there is a 2nd season in the works otherwise this is a very boring anime.",

I would say the anime didn't do much justice, as most scenes had to be cut to fit into the anime, so the ending had to be changed as well. However, the anime still managed to show the loving connection between the lovers and managed to keep the audience entertain with their relationship. As well as including the important scenes which makes us go like \"why can't I have a relationshiplike that too?\". So I would say the anime is still pretty good!\\n\\n\r\nThe Art and Songs:\\n\r\nI love the way each characters are drawn, as it portrayed the characters' personality well. For example, the guy ( (Kou Mabuchi) had a very charming face to show how charming of a person he is as well as the girl (Futaba Yoshioka) having a very kawaii look giving her a friendly aura. The background may not be as spectacular like Spirited away or Your Name, but it still gives a heartwarming effect. As for the song, it was sweet and upbeat which perfectly displayed how the anime was.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I enjoyed it and would highly recommend this to anyone who loves romance animes :)",

The reason why I enjoyed this anime so much is because it's more realistic. The characters don't fall in love with each other instantly like all those other cliche romance stories. Of course they fall in love at the end because it's a shoujo romance anime, but the journey through their relationship is very unique. I'm actually not a big fan of romance shows because of how misleading and fake the relationships are. That's why I enjoyed Ao Haru Ride.\r\nArt: 8\r\nThe art is verybeautiful. Each character has a unique look that matches their personality. It has a 3D feel to it and the animations are not flat.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nI love the sound tracks in this anime. The voices in the subs are really good too. They fit the characters perfectly and the audio is great. Good music, good sounds and good voicing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nI absolutely love every character in Ao Haru Ride. They're all really cliche but unique at the same time. Futaba is the usual cheerful shoujo anime girl. She is hardworking and wants to be someone that everyone likes. Kou is the usual cool and silent type. These characteristics are very popular amongst shoujo animes but the reason why Ao haru Ride is so special is because the characters stay true to themselves. They don't lose their personalities but they develop themselves like real people would. They also do it in a realistic way.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nThere are many scenes in Ao Haru Ride that I love re watching over and over again. Many cute romantic scenes that'll make you feel warm and fuzzy on the inside. There's comedy, romance and romance scenes that will touch your heart.",

What I did not like was that the story becomes very slow over the last few chapters and the ending is unfinished and to some extent disappointing.\r\nThe art has something goodand bad, what I liked were the animations type \"watercolor\" in the retrospective and scenes of the Secondary. What I did not like was the disproportionate form of the facial expressions of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe Soundtrack (in my opinion) is the strong point of the anime, Opening is one of those who is happy to hear at the beginning of each chapter and the Ending is quite calmer but just as good. I also really liked the song \"I Will\" by Chelsy, which sounds in certain scenes during the story, which will go directly to my Playlist.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters also have opposite scores, the melancholy girl Futaba and the Inexpressive Kou are the main protagonists who cover almost 95% of the story, they are not memorable characters but they manage to entertain for a good time. Of the secondary characters who has more participation is Yuuri who also develops feelings towards Kou, the rest of personages hardly appears forcibly in some scenes.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion Ao Haru Ride is an average story that will make you have a good time if you are of those who like the Slice of Life, I really liked it.",

(Can't say the same for her annoying voice).\r\nThe storyline isn't original and definitely not surprising. The way the main characters argue and how they always just \"happen\" to run into each other is pretty ridiculous. \r\nI think if I didn't like the main male character so much,I wouldn't have watched this show, but he definitely made the show entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nI probably wouldn't recommend this show to most people, but for those looking for a corny romantic time-killer, this is the show for you!

            "content": "\"Ao Haru Ride\" is one hell of an emotional journey.\r\n \"Ao Haru Ride,\" a heartwarming romance piece, is a story that captures the heart with its beautiful art and intricate plot design.\r\nIn this lovely piece of art, Futaba is played by Uchida, Maaya (the voice of Takanashi, Rikka [Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai!], Iki, Hiyori [Noragami], and Alluka Zoldyck [HunterxHunter]). Uchida undergoes a marvelous transformation, suddenly becoming a jaded young lady with a weakness for love. Her portrayal of Futaba is wonderful in that she's not annoying with Futaba's needy mannerisms. Another gem of the voice acting world is Kaji, Yuki (voice of Finnian [BlackButler], Alibaba Saluja [Magi], and Eren Jeager [Attack on Titan]) staring as the voice of Mabuchi, Kou. This is literally the dark side of Kaji's voice, and I say sexy! Kaji continues to hit his target dead on by bringing the insecure and shut off Kou to life.\\n\\n\r\nThe most wonderful part about the anime is the character development. There are massive amounts of character development going on! And Sakisaka, Io, the author of the story, hits her audience with the most heartbreaking stories. Also, not to mention the art is just lovely. There are some many details put into the art from the characters to the backgrounds. The style alone just makes one feel like they're floating through a sea of beauty. The only sad part about \"Ao Haru Ride\" is that the concept is used quite often -- but it is still a worthwhile anime to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThose who take pleasure in giggling at the budding romance of two characters will be sure to love this anime. There are many characters a viewer can connect with, and no one has to be limited to the main two. However, to the people who are jaded and think love cannot possibly exist (like me), you will simply wonder why all these characters behave like they do. This anime will simply not be an enjoyment. But regardless of one's personal feelings, this anime is a sweet, innocent romance that can give the feeling of hope to all who watch it.\\n\r\n-\\n\r\nStory - 8\\n\r\n\"Ao Haru Ride\" has a delicate storyline that will capture one's interest immediately. Unfortunately, this type of romance has been explored many times. However, that does not mean that this isn't worth the while. It certainly is. \"Ao Haru Ride\" is like take a breath of fresh spring air.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9\\n\r\nThe artwork is beautiful and so detailed from character design to backgrounds. Sakisaka, Io has a lovely style that conveys the message of sweet innocence. I can tell a lot of passion and hard work went into the art for this anime.\\n\\n\r\nMusic - 8\\n\r\nThe music perfectly fit the mood of this piece. The opening was filled with cute curiosity with its bubbly, yet melodic tune. Ending the anime is a lovely piece that is relaxing, and makes everything feel right. The music inside the anime were also lovely pieces that were perfectly timed with the action.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 9\\n\r\nThere was a lot of character development. I got to see Futaba mature even though her childish qualities remained. I also got to see many sides of Kou that seemed unlikely to be in him, but they were and it made me happy. Even the side characters like Yuuri, a cute girl who was ostracized by the females like Futaba, and Murao, a mature girl who has a crush on a teacher, grew in unexpected ways.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8\\n\r\nI normally don't enjoy romances, but \"Ao Haru Ride\" really captured my attention. It was high on my hype list, and earned an ever higher spot as I was watching it. There were some point where I avoided having to watch this anime, but that was only because of the cliffhangers left by the previous episode.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8.4\\n\r\n\"Ao Haru Ride\" was a great anime, and I'm glad I invested my time into it. Staring at the artwork and listening to the music were great treats for my senses. I even sang along to the opening song. But watching the character develop was really was the best part of this anime. It's a really good show for one that's been done so many times, and I really loved it.\\n",

            "content": "Ao Haru Ride - A Shoujo done correctly\r\nBlue Spring Ride is a series of shoujo manga/anime written and illustrated by Io Sakisaka.\r\n(Which by the way is a woman that makes sense for this story be at the maximum level of friend zone)\r\nIt began to be serialized in February 2011 in the journal \"Bessatsu Margaret\" of Shueisha.\r\nThe anime version was made by Production I.G. and directed by Ai Yoshimura aired in Japan in July 2014.\r\nThe opening theme of the series is \"Sekai wa Koi ni Ochiteiru\" by Chico and HoneyWorks while the ending theme is \"Buru\" by Fujifabric.\r\nIt was also made a live action directed byTakahiro Miki film was released on December 13, 2014.\\n\r\nThe genders in this story are Comedy, Drama, Romance, School, Shoujo and Slice of Life.\\n\r\nThe first tank\u014dbon volume was released on April 13, 2011, and ten volumes have been released until May 23, 2014.\\n\\n\r\nSynopsis: Futaba Yoshioka liked to give a new direction to his life.Yoshioka had no friends because many boys liked her. However, the one for whom she was in love, Kou Tanaka, pulled away from her before she could confess. Now in the secondary, Yoshioka is determined to be unkind and rude to the guys, so that her new friends do not feel jealous of her. She was happy with her life, to reconnect with Kou, who now uses the name Kou Mabuchi. He says he was in love with her at the time, but nowadays he says that their feelings are indifferent.\\n\r\nThis anime has only one available season (12 episodes) and one Ova serving episode 13.\\n\\n\r\nReview: For this review, it will be like \"You know when / mistress put a wall forward and are waiting for someone who really cares to chop it?\"\\n\r\nThis anime is the true definition of that phrase. As a story, however, is something \"harping on.\" The chick likes him and tries everything he just says \"I love you\" then the end comes the part of friend zone or simply he did not like it that way. This is something repetitive and delays a possible new existing Shoujo anime style. The animation is cheerful, energetic and brilliant - mix a lot of colors that combine well with their own characters and the very atmosphere of the anime, not to say that the background music complements the series a fantastic way - serves as reinforcement to give suspense current or so scenes to give a sense of emotions present for a moment in silence.\\n\r\nPersonal advice: - Sometimes seeing Shoujo anime help us to understand certain things that we do not understand especially if we like someone that much.\\n\r\nI advise undoubtedly this anime shoujo, even for those who do not like anime where the characters date at the end or something.",

            "content": "I really, really, really did not enjoy this anime. It was a recommendation from Black Prince and the Wolf Girl so I came into full of hope. For the first half, I was prepared to review this positively. There are definitely similarities to both Black Prince and to My Little Monster and the variations on the characters were good. \r\nI started getting frustrated by how similarly all of the characters appeared. The animation level is quite high so it made it feel all the worse when we meet a few characters and it's hard to find the difference between them and the existing characters (ex.leadership training, middle school classmates/friends).\\n\\n\r\nIn episode 7 or 8, something small happens that led to my complete loss of enjoyment for the rest of the show. For the remaining episodes, I kept waiting for that element to be picked up but it either wasn't or it was done so in a cruel fashion. I shouldn't have to guess either way.\\n\\n\r\nI understand the manga goes further so it's entirely possible that this show fully planned on a second season. I want my anime to be able to stand alone though. I want the show to entice me to go read by making me care about the characters and plot lines and want the extra detail. Here it felt more like a lot of loose plot threads. It's the anime version of ending your book with a cliffhanger to force your hand in buying the sequel. It leaves a sour taste in your mouth.\\n\\n\r\nKou and Futaba are nicely designed though. I really liked the spin that she was more of a tomboy and wanted to beat against the expectations of her femininity while still being a fully functioning student. Kou started out well and especially the flashbacks of how he used to be juxtaposed with how he is now were great. He ended up wearing on me.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I personally wish I hadn't watched this. It feels a lot like Black Prince and the Wolf Girl, My Little Monster, and Orange all smushed into one but without being as good as any of them. I don't recommend.",

I actually overall liked the show and the romance was pretty good but god i wish there was more romance. the reason i rated the characters 7/10 because i felt like there could have been way more involving himself the of male MC. Like just be a little more chill and like the girl already. And i did like the main girl character however i do not see why she thought if she ate a lotguys wont look at her. Like bih ima eat cause food taste good. Alsooo Id wanna have a nice body for myself. But anyways the art was good this is the type of art i personally like and personally cant really watch a series if the art it bad and if the chracters kind of look baby like even if their highschool students. I like the chracters to look more mature yet still cute and i am gonna keep this review short cause i hate reading long reviews so there you go if you are looking for a good romance anime with not much actual romance as in physical this is an anime for you also a little bit of comedy too and would definitally watch this a third time.:)",

So I decided to watch this, as a boy, I thought romance genre was just for girls, but boy, I was never been wrong in my life. \r\nThe story is just relatable to any person out there who has problems talking to the person they likes. It shows what will you do if the person you like will go out of your reach and suddenly you will meet again.  You cry, move on or you want to tell them whatyou feel if you meet again.\\n\\n\r\nThe atmosphere is calm and romantic. The characters are well developed and given enough screentime. The music is a great choice to this anime. The romance is top notched and it will be one of the best romance out there if THERE will be a Season 2 in the future.",

The feeling was always \"light\" when i watched every episodes. Probably the best word would be Balance, no excessive drama or wacky antics. \r\nStory 8/10- The overview says its about futaba, misunderstood during her junior years so she had to changed her personality to gain friends in high school.  This conflict was quickly resolved after few episodes thanks to the main guy(kou). She reunited with her childhood love, from there I thought the pace wouldbe faster but the story mostly revolves around kou, he's got personal issues related to his parting with futaba 3 years ago and why he changed his name. Within those conflicts they started living a new life in high school with a new set of \"true friends\" experiencing that blue spring ride of their youth\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10- maybe its just me, but some of the painting-like backgrounds and the blurry effects were not that effective for me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 8/10-  well-portrayed characters, just the right amount of acting applicable for the situation. I just noticed a little bit too much of blushings and staring(eye to eye), i guess its a required element for romance lol!\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10- sweet opening music, im not an expert about sound effects, i'd say it sounded the way it should sound in reality ^^ \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10- I've read the manga so i felt short since its not complete. Maybe the simplicity that i noticed would be an intro for an exciting 2nd season, Hopefully. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, i give it a 7 still worth your time watching, try to read the manga after completing the series, you will like it more coz i'm not sure if there will be season 2.  Cheesy stuffs and life lessons are surely here, the main characters made some mistakes, it makes me even hate them sometimes, i only hated kou though because he's a slacker. In the end I realize its part of being young, and that makes a person grow. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

I know that the story isn't finished and is going on in the manga, but what I've seen so far in 12 episodes made me cry of happiness and joy! The Anime has its own beautiful drawstyle, and like I already said before the characters depth is awesome as well as the storyline!\r\nMyoverall rating is 10/10 (maybe a little bit subjective, but hopefully not too much) and I can't wait until second season",

The general audience is for females, HOWEVER, I feel like any guy can watch this.\r\nSTORY: Personally, the story isn't original, usually in a story something something sad happens to the main character (The guy) and the female tries to fix it, I gave it a ten because it still moved me despite that. \r\nART: I felt like the character were drawn a bit weird, it was drawn differently than normal but I still liked it. It wasn't the best though but it's not a deal breaker. \r\nSOUND: For soundI usually just put the opening here, and let me say, I love the opening. It was great, it was so catchy, it's the best. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: The main thing I like about the characters is that I slowly get to know them better. And learn what's happening in their lives and it puts them on a more emotional level. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 10. What can I say? I cried and the ending was great, I love it. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone.",

They obviously have changed and it is like a \"second opportunity\" story. Even though it is mostly like \"the typical shojo anime\" one strong point is that it doesn't focus only in the main story (the one of the leading characters) but also in the stories of the supporting characters. \r\nA negative point of this anime is that the most exciting events aren't shown, asthey will happen later... but it is a good start and indeed a nice tv adaptation, pretty loyal to the manga.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8.\\n\\n\r\nShojo-like art, with decent character design, backgrounds and all that. I didn't like some of the colours chosen (for example Touma's hair or even Futaba's. Her hair is okay, but I would have expected a lighter brown.). Facial expressions are probably the best of the art, they are really funny.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP is really appropiate, the lyrics absolutely fit the anime's story. The rest of the OST is nice too.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\\n\r\nI really like how every single character has an unique and pretty complex personality. They aren't exactly stereotypical characters and they are far from being perfect. In addition, they start to become more mature little by little, changing constantly and accepting their reality... without forgetting what they want to achieve. Moreover, they make a nice friends gang.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\\n\r\nI have enjoyed this show soooo much that I continued reading online the manga, even if I really hate reading online. Right now, I'm even buying the manga because it has been licensed in my country. This is a story that has never bored me, specially because I strongly identify myself with Futaba. I hope another season of the anime is produced because the best is about to come!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9. Nice anime but still can improve.",

            "content": "Ao Haru Ride is exactly what a seinin-classified viewer who is tired of slice of life harems is looking for in a shoujo series. The show focuses on the cute, albeit slowly developing, relationship between two high school students, who once harbored crushes on each other. It has some nice, romantic development similar to what you'd find in Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun or Sukitte Ii na yo with a bit of group-based development more recently found in P.A. Works shows like Glasslip or Nagi no Asukara. It's nice to hear a story told from a girl's point of view for once, especially in a setting thatdoesn't involve swarms of overly-bishounen dudes, pink colors, and sparkles all over the place. If you're sore after watching Glasslip and want an idea of what it could have been, definitely get on this ride.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nWhile Production I.G did a pretty good job with the animation overall, it still doesn't match up to P.A. Works in this department. Many episodes (especially the first) start out with a flashback. This utilizes a noticeably blurry, painted/drawn style with very little color saturation. Note that this is an artistic touch and the majority of the show isn't in this style (for better or worse- the former in my opinion). The non-flashback scenes use a more-saturated color palette and crisper lines. While the backgrounds are a bit less detailed than some other shows, they still serve their purpose. Character animation is fairly good overall with distinguishable characters and a good focus on facial animations; expect a good quantity of crying and other cute/awkward/embarrassing moments. Eyes are a bit on the large side but not really a distraction once you get used to it. It might just be the hairstyle but Yuuri reminds me a lot of Sayaka from Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou. Oh, yes there are manly tears as well.\\n\\n\r\nThis is definitely not an action show and equally not an ecchi show. There is probably one accident involving Futaba but it's sort of a reverse-ecchi moment, it will make sense when you see it. In any case, emotions and facial reads are definitely more in girls' domain, and it definitely shows here.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe show starts with a light pop song that fits with the relatively light, somewhat mellow pacing of the show. The OP tune is fair in general but the main theme does get a bit catchy after awhile. I don't normally like slow guy songs, but the ED is among the better ones. I also liked how they timed the animation of the stars with the initial piano notes. I will give this show a huge prop for using a nice insert song and tying it as a series theme into the BGM. This central theme alone elevates the BGM above average shows for me.\\n\\n\r\nVeteran Maaya Uchida leads a veteran cast including the likes of Ai Kayano, Marina Inoue, and even Aya Hisakawa. Daisuke Hirakawa, on the mens side, gets the thumbs up for the optimistic dual onii-chan and sensei role. A lot of the show is dialogue driven and the VAs do a great job of bringing out their respective personalities.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nOur protagonist Futaba once had a crush for a soft-spoken, short guy named Kou Tanaka. Unfortunately for her, he mysteriously vanished from her life. Fast forward to high school and Futaba finally meets up with him again. How will she take advantage of this rare, gem opportunity? Unfortunately, she's going to have to work for it as people apparently change as they grow.\\n\\n\r\nThis show really bridges a lot of categories in a nice way. It effectively balances elements of slice of life, romance, comedy, and drama and all the while manages to fend off girly vibes. It is a pretty slow show in terms of the overarching plot, but perhaps that is for the better as a more realistic portrayal of relationships (cue the instant girlfriend). As a bonus, there are subplots and themes tied into the main story that are well developed and explored. Not only does Futaba have to figure out Kou, she also has to deal with her self-image and the fickle topic of friendship. In summary, you're definitely going to get your share of development in this show.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the structure of the story, it pretty much follows a single, linear plot with a slight focus on Futaba for the first half and a slight focus on Kou in the second half. A lot of the events are a bit on the predictable side but there are definitely some surprises hidden in the show. The story grows to a small bump of a climax near the end and spends an entire episode on the conclusion, a bit unusual but actually quite nice as it gives plenty of resolution.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nContinuing on my rant, I feel as if many shoujo shows carry a more realistic portrayal of people than their shounen (and even seinin) counterparts. Girls worry more about just the dude they're chasing and guys actually are complicated creatures too, not just nice guys who lack bark and bite or overly egotistic, single-minded shouting creatures set on conquering the world. This show does a great job of illustrating these points through character development and interactions in even guy-digestible package. Don't expect any of the finger-waving, highly metaphorical development of Glasslip. In addition to the complexity of the protagonists and their romantic development, I also liked the balance between their development and that of the supporting cast.\\n\\n\r\nValue:\\n\r\nIf you haven't yet noticed, I think there's a lot to like about this show. It's not quite as heart-grabbing or dramatic as Golden Time but yet manages to still capture one's attention in a way that makes time fly. It also is one of those shows that leave you with a positive message and overall feeling. Ao Haru Ride is a very entertaining and worthwhile watch for anyone looking for a bit of romance, and a bit of patience for actually getting there.",

            "content": "And here I go again, talking bad and complaining about an anime that eeeeveryone seems to love... But please don't misunderstand me. It's not like I hate Aoharaido. I just feel like... A sadness bomb just exploded in my room. And spread shit everywhere.\r\nLet's talk why.\r\nAo Haru Ride is one of those shoujo romance of a sweet, smiling an persistent girl triyng to win the love of a cold and strange but handsome guy. The story it's pretty much this and it's the most used clich\u00e9 in shoujo, by the way.\r\nNow, why is this so bad? Where is the \"shit\" I've talked before? ~Ohh, comeon, where's your sense of romance?- you may ask. Yeah, I admit, it seems pretty normal, right? But I took a little longer to see why Ao Haru Ride left me with the uneasy feeling that something was wrong hiding between the lines. And by that \"wrong\" I mean almost all the problems I have with shoujo romances and the reason why I came to like much more of josei mangas. Like, a LOT more. I still struggle to read some manga and see some shoujo anime, but some make me sick and this is one of them. Especially because is one of those stories that when you think of the protagonists, your feelings are always on the threshold between pure anger and shame.\\n\\n\r\nI think shoujo always tends to have some little flaws here and there but most of them I just... Let go. But, since recently many mangas with similar subjects that are not very positive for the readers are showing up and being all popular, especially considering that most of shoujo audience are teenage girls (and grown men, hahaha!), I wanted to at least give some nudges from time to time whenever I find some that are\\n\\n\r\nSO\\n\r\nWRONG\\n\r\nIN\\n\r\nSO\\n\r\nMANY\\n\r\nLEVELS\\n\\n\r\nthat kicks you on the balls.\\n\\n\r\nBefore starting to explain it, let me just tell you that If you haven't seen all the episodes, please take care because this review may have some minor spoilers, but I'll try my best not to do it, though. And also I will not talk about the whole story, just about two points that scared me enough to see it through totally different eyes.\\n\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\n1 - So, let's begin with the episode that shows us the flashback from Kou and his story with his ill mother. \\n\\n\r\nFirst, we can clearly see here the prototypical of an asian kid focusing too much on his studies and, even though he regrets it later, because he chose to not spend time with his dying mother. And after, a boy who have to deal with a divorce and start battling with loneliness and his low self-esteem. Kou starts to get distant from his own brother, feeling guilty for not being able to fulfill his promise to him.\\n\\n\r\nI think that's a harsh life and a lot to a young kid to bear, right? Of course, the answer is yes. But seriously, all that was a sadness bomb to me and I'm not the first one to say it that way. And like the first person I've saw talking about this, we are on 21st century and we really should start taking mental illness seriously by stop dropping romance bullshit on it. And of course, this is not happening on Aoharaido. Futaba keeps idly trying to form a relationship with whats essentially an ill person. A lot of fan-girls disagreed, of course, but if you make a list of all Kou's reactions at the anime to everything and show it to a professional psychologist, you can be sure that the answer will be that he IS rather ill. People who disagree or think it's an overreaction are also part of the problem, and that's my point here. People need to stop thinking that depression is not a serious illness like any other, because IT IS and it kills as much as any other disease does. So, instead of making a character like Kou to fight the stigma surrounding depression and other mental health related illnesses, we see a boy in a clear stage of depression being forced to maintain a relationship of friendship and to endure a loving relationship he most likely has no emotional condition to deal with. Then, my most hated clich\u00e9 is used: \"Love heals everything\". And I really don't know where a forced relationship with someone who needs psychological treatment can be \"healing\" somehow. So, I really need you guys to understand one thing: If you realize that depression is a disease, are you or are you not sick? Yes, of course you\u2019re sick! You need help! And, above all, the last thing you should worry about is your love life.\\n\\n\r\nAo Haru Ride is a story that should have tooked a different direction and... Gosh, it would have been an excellent anime if it were one of the few that help deconstructing the stigma around this issue. Futaba had to accept the fact that there wasn't anything she could do but to be supportive and friendly. Then, maybe later, when he\u2019s healthy again, they can even consider love. But instead, the story\u2019s trapped in the constraints of a stereotypical shoujo anime. His friends just tell him \"ganbatte\" with their actions all the time and take him anywhere, like it would solve everything. Good intentions, yes. But no mental illness can be cured with that. And again, please, this illness need to be taken seriously.\\n\\n\r\nThe point here is just to tell you guys that Ao Haru Ride was really frustrating to watch. And I'm not the first person to also say that just hanging around with friends will not cure a sick person like Kou and a girl like Futaba saying he should just \"get over it\" won't do the trick too. I see many people cursing Kou and saying that he is a dick, that he is an annoying teenager but no one seems to understand why is he like that. Let's stop and think about it. Should we really say that a boy who have lost his mother and went through so many difficult moments during his youth is just a \"damn dick\"? What if he came to hate himself so much that cannot even think he deserves to have friends? \\n\\n\r\nI hope that, although this had been repetitive, helped you to think better about it.\\n\\n\r\n2 - Then we arrived at the scene where Kou bravely \"warns\" Futaba she should not go around walking with men so confidently. She doubted it, saying she knew he was not like that, and then, in a full glitter scenario, he threatens to rape her.\\n\\n\r\nPLEASE, if you are a woman and a guy that you like needs to pretend that he's going to rape you so you can know that you should not rely on men, make a HUGE favor to yourself and dump him! D-U-M-P H-I-S A-S-S! Forget his existence! Stay far away. This is really serious business, man! And the problem is not only that he threatened to rape her, but also that the scene was embellished, as if this was an exciting or romantic thing. She starts to cry, but not because he threatened her, but for futile reasons still correlated with their attempt to reach the feelings of a person who is not in his best moments of sanity. And fuck! It makes me mad as hell. Is she out of her fucking mind? She should reconsider the priorities of what really looks like a problem! And finally, somebody needs to tell mangakas to STOP romanticizing rape scenes! They need to know that this is nothing but disgusting and outrageous and that guys like that need a doctor, not a fucking stereotyped shoujo anime. They need to think about what they are teaching to teenage girls! Because no one have to accept a relationship like that NEVER!\\n\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nSo, in short, we have here a \"beautiful\" story that trivializes a serious illness and that romanticize rape. Not bad, huh? NO! Gosh... This is fucked up! After a manga as incredible as Strobe Edge, WHY THIS? WHY?\\n\\n\r\nAll I wanted to say is that there is nothing more courageous than beeing yourself and realizing that your depression is no cause for shame. And that friends are not crutches, and loves are not magic medicines. If you feel depressed, get help. If your love interest is depressed, encourage him/her to seek help. After all, love is really the same as that silly phrase that says \"if you have to force it, it is because it will become shit\". Nothing but that.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe I'm just being a boring chitchatter girl, for a change. Maybe I should really move once and for all to josei and stop complaining about shoujo. But since it's still one of my favorite styles of manga, I want at least to keep my critical position! I do it always with all the mangas I read, mainly shoujo. And I always like to say to everyone to do the same, because I think it's healthy and it's something that should be encouraged. For girls who like it and also collect shoujo mangas like me, I just ask you to always keep your eyes open. Because even if the story is all cute and cuddly she is not exempt from criticism. And just because the characters are catching and seemingly true that they are free from flaws and big failures. Mangas and animes are seen as very pure entertainment, but it has always been an influence for a large list of things and it's synonymous of serious work that can cost millions, and it is MEDIA. And by being media, means that they also can sin just trying to reach a bigger audience.\\n\\n\r\nSo, sadly, I can't recommend it to anyone that enjoys a healthy love story and a healthy life.\\n\\n\r\nAnd if you are reading this and you agree, please stay far away from Ookami Shoujo to Kuro Ouji too. \\n",

I prefer anime where it's hard for the characters to be together rather it being easy and their struggles after. I just loved the characters in this! The theme song is so good! Has a sadness to it but it sounds so nice! Highly recommend",

I do quite enjoy stories like this but don't expect anything groundbreaking.\r\nThe art is good, it truly fits the show, then again, it's not outstanding. The sound however is something I didn't quite enjoy, all of the tracks felt like they belonged only in the background, instead of stirring up your emotions everyonce in a while, which is needed in an anime like this. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are alright, but they are again, not groundbreaking. Your typical somewhat 'manly' girl who wants to act more girly and the 'I don't care about anything and don't really show emotions' boy. \\n\\n\r\nAs such, you can probably see the repeating pattern in this review, this anime is not bad, nor is it really amazing. It's a lovely little story, which is certainly enjoyable. The only thing is that nothing really stands out, therefore making the show quite forgetful.

            "content": "it is an exciting anime that makes one think of the girls who are in love what to do I am sorry that there is no second season of this anime but I wish there were, can not leave an open end or not?\r\nI like the characters as they are made even as they are character.\r\nThe protagonist of the story is Futaba Yoshioka: because of the sentence \"I hate all males\" she pronounced, a misunderstanding was created with the only boy she liked, or Kou Tanaka. The two, among other things, could no longer clarify why Tanaka moved a few days later without leaving news.Now Futaba is in high school and has changed considerably: she has taken on a somewhat rough and not very feminine attitude to avoid attracting the envy of the other girls, who considered her too cute. However, the peace that had managed to create itself will be upset by the return of Kou, who, in addition to having changed his last name, is completely different from how Futaba remembered him.\\n\r\nWanting to go and look for the hair of the egg, the premises described above may seem a little forced, as if the author had been puzzled to look for an original incipit and to entice the public to choose its product. However, the first episode of \"Ao Haru Ride\" turns out to be not bad, thanks to a very sweet flashback and an equally sweet encounter.\\n\r\nThe real problem, however, lies in the development of the subsequent installments. As usual, the anime in question is chock-full of all the clich\u00e9s and stereotypical situations typical of shoujo: the grumpy guy who shows his tender side only with the protagonist, the study session among friends, the friend who falls in love with the same boy as the protagonist, the girl infatuated by the professor and so on. To this we must add all the various scenes that make people blush and excite, in addition to the girl in question, even the spectators (see the boy who shows up with a bare chest or who tries shamelessly without ever going to the bottom).\\n\r\nThe characterization of the characters is obviously closely related to the above themes. However, even in this regard, no excellent work has been done. Let's start with Futaba: all the good things I talked about earlier were partly ruined by the usual tendencies typical of the shoujo's protagonists: for example, she follows her lover like a stalker or goes into raptures for every aspect of her, from the \u201cform of the pretty head \u201d(please?) to the smell of the shampoo mixed with the smell of sweat. If with Futaba there is, therefore, a relationship of love / hate, the same is true of Kou. Certainly one cannot remain indifferent to the motivations behind his change, and that unlike the girl do not derive from a voluntary choice. However, the boy with the \"door of the heart\" that must be broken through to kicking if he wants to open it, is completely closed and grumpy. Because, as mentioned above, sometimes it proves, even indirectly, to be sensitive and generous. This behavior is quite unnatural and planned to ingratiate the viewers (besides being obviously predictable and typical of this stereotype).\\n\r\nThe two protagonists are the only ones to talk about: except for Yuuri, who is still a not so brilliant character, Murao and Kominato remain somewhat anonymous until the last episode. Another aspect that I did not appreciate is how the group was formed: the friendship between the five boys, which is so much bandied about inside the anime, seems to be born out of nothing. It follows that the relations established between them appear very forced.\\n\r\nLet's move on to the technical side. Character design and animations are perfect in the first and in the last episode, while in the remaining ones not a little waver. On the other hand, the backgrounds are always excellent: in particular, I really liked the watercolor colors used in the flashbacks. The OSTs are quite catchy, as are the opening and ending: the first is fresh and urgent, the second is slow and melancholic. Bella also the insert song \"I will\" proposed several times.\\n\r\nI found Ao Haru Ride a beautiful delicate and sweet soul like the breath of a summer breeze. Ideal when you have a heart full of love and good feelings. The opening is nice and catchy, the voice is sweet and the music really remains in the heart. In conclusion, 13 episodes are few for an anime that, developed like the manga, could have done better.",

It was worth it.\r\nStory 9/10: I actually found the premise interesting from the very beginning even if it's not the most original, however as it goes on, its strength doesn't lie in the progression of the plot, but in the development of the characters. \r\nArt 10/10: The very first thing that pulled me in was the use of watercolors in the flashbacks, I was really sad when it switched to the present and they didn't use that anymore, but other than that I have no complaints. I'm very fond of the characterdesigns and the brightness of the art really adds to the overall atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10: The voice acting is solid, though I couldn't really name any outstanding performances apart from the main characters, but the ost is beautiful. It's so sweet and it fits the show so well and it is used exactly as it should be in every single scene. I've been listening to it since I finished the show and I don't plan on stopping any time soon.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10: I don't think the characters in this can be fully appreciated without reading the manga, but the way they're presented here is still a pretty good introduction to them, especially to the main characters, though the show does a very good job with some of the side characters as well. I really love both Yoshioka and Kou's character arcs, as they both grow noticeably through the show, but of course my favourite thing is the dynamic between them. Though they do tend to not communicate as much as they should, they work very well together in any situation, and it genuinely feels like a natural progression of their relationship, not just something that happens for the sake of the plot. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10: There were times when I was tearing my hair out in frustration, and the ending is spectacularly unsatisfying, but I did enjoy watching it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10: This is a very good romance anime, though definitely not one that I'd recommend to everyone thanks to the miscommunication, the sheer amount of internal dialogue, and the 'read the manga' ending.",

I don't read manga at all but I loved the anime so much that I watched it 3 times and I hunted down the manga and read it and I'm thinking of reading again. It's not too unrealistic like I hate to admit but most romance anime is, in the sense of the main love interest isn't so 'innocent' and 'love is easy'. The main couple went through trial and tribulation both giving up and then fighting for one another again. The main love interest has a backstory and is effected realistically by it. The people around themhave backstories as well but not as well delved into as the main characters but still enough for you t appreciate them. The art is pretty good and I listen to the soundtrack as I do homework.\\n\r\nI am a romance anime connoisseur. I've been watching it for years and have seen almost every romance anime there is. I think that this one is my favorite out of all the ones I've watched over the years. I can admit there is better out there but this fits my taste almost perfectly. I would recommend it to anyone looking to quench their hearts thirst for love.",

This anime has a Live-action movie, which I think is much more complete than theanime.",

            "content": "Ao Haru Ride--or Blue Spring Ride was an anime that slowed down the pace for me, it made me think about my friendships, my hardships, my memories, my family and in certain cases my childhood (I'm only 15-hahahhaha). Plus I was watching fantasy, unrealistic, action type anime, and that's all I had been watching at the time. So I'm thankful that I watched this. \r\nStory 7/10 (Well let's just dive right into it~)\r\nThe story follows Yoshioka Futaba, Mabuchi Kou, Makita Yuuri, Murao Shuuko and Aya Kominato. All high school students, who all coincidentally have weird, teenage problems. We will discover and watch what these problemsare through not the screen, but through life itself. (Ha!)\\n\\n\r\nThe story felt oddly relatable to me, I'm not saying that I can personally relate to the things that happen in this, because that's too personal, and I don't want you to know that - but the story does a good job at enticing you (or at least me) into the anime. I think the reminiscing, the act of nostalgia in this anime is what makes up a good majority of the story, I mean think about it (or don't), us as humans, learn, grow, re-live and create memories from past experiences, annnnd this is exactly what Ao Haru Ride does. (spoiler) For example Futaba, gets all jittery when she sees Tanaka-kuns face after how long. She thinks back to the middle school days, where she believed she loved him. And that in turn gets her hopes up and excited!\\n\r\nIsn't that exactly how we as humans are? Now you can argue that this anime was created by humans, and that of course it's like this, all anime is like this... psshhhhh your dumb SunZun. But it's to reflect off of how naive we are! Just because we had a good time in the past together doesn't mean things are the same now, \"you don't know me now... I'm sorry you idiot.\" (A quote from my childhood friend from the 1st grade...) The story just gets me thinking like this and I can't help it.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself, I just felt it was lacking in something extra spicy, I'm not saying that adding another character (cough-cough) like another Mahle love interest into it would be the best option, but Futaba is just wayyyy to head over heals for Kou. And yet, that's what I find so appealing, a true Shoujo, I liked how she was trying so hard to get to know Kou better, and not just him, but everyone. I guess you could say that's how everyone is. It's just, there really isn't any major conflict except for their feelings, which is pretty basic if you ask me. But I couldn't wish for more (hahaha, JK ofc I could). Sure the simple everyday hardships they go through is normal in terms of real life, but it's how they deal with the situations that warm my heart, and magically have something fly into my eye. It's just the love triangle kills me, ( #ThatMomentWhenYouKnowThereIsAMasterRace ) not because I feel bad for one of the girls, but just because that third lover is so un-asked for. \\n\\n\r\nOverall the plot isn't complex at all, the story is simply here to comfort and settle in the characters - and was made only to define the characters. As I felt that, in this anime the story took it in day by day, you didn't know what was going to happen, only hints and tidbits of clues and foreshadow showed up. That is refreshing, being able to just go at life day by day...\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\nDepending on what types of art styles you are used to, this one might be new to you, as in these types of faces aren't usually generic. Personally I loved how these characters looked, at first I was a little put off, but I got use to it. The simple background was just there and I wasn't too impressed by it. Nonetheless a nice palette was used, and I think that complimented the characters and the mood of the show a lot. Overall not too bad. Oh and I liked the Opening and closing art.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8 / 10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was actually pretty good. I think this show is purely based on its characters, so of course the other qualities it brings like sound will compliment what it is based on. The sound complimented the show itself as well as the story very, very, very well. The sound track just fit every mood the show had to offer, and made it even better. As for the opening and endings, I sort of liked the opening, quite a bit. And as for the endings, I sort of liked those too, their just not the most memorable. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10 (7.5/10)\\n\\n\r\nLike I stated before, the show is heavily dependent, if not solely dependent on its main cast of characters. Which I usually don't mind in most cases, this one in particular. Characters had their ups and downs. \\n\\n\r\nThe girl, Yoshioka Futaba, is a changed woman, from the cutesy rooster magnet, to the girl who stuffs herself with no shame (wait is that a problem??!??!??), meets Kou again after a few years. Kou, you can tell has gone through a lot in just those few years, from being called \"Tanaka-Kun!\" to \"Mabuchi-kun.\" You can obviously tell at least a divorce had happened, not even that but his whole demeanor changed. Then, right after something that made me think about my friends happens Futaba meets, Makita Yuuri, the reincarnation of Futaba from middleschool, almost. Finally they go on to meet the other 2 which I don't really care for, Murao Shuuko and Aya Kominato.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting characters are sort of just there to help make the main characters grow, which in my opinion is better than having the supporting there to just be there, but I think that the supporting characters actually had a big role in this show.\\n\\n\r\nI don't know how to feel about these characters, I don't know if I should like them or not. I mean they are like able, but annoying. It's like all they have is each other and that's a bit odd, I know that you should be living for the moment with the people you care for, but the characters fail at creating a natural foundation of genuine happiness. In other words, I don't know what the characters are thinking, and I still won't know how they will act if something that offends them goes off. \\n\r\nAll in all these characters aren't bland, because they are good at expressing how they feel, but as a downside a majority of the time I found them to be quite predictable. And they don't really resemble anime characters (I mean they do), but more of human characters put into an anime world. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed pretty much all of this, because what can I say, I'm an easy romantic who's into love and high school students. No, but seriously, I liked the nostalgia it created, and the way it presented the \"let's create memories together\" part. I mean there really isn't much to say, I just really enjoyed the characters and the music.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10 - 7.5/10\\n\r\nNow, overall the story of Ao Haru Ride is pretty simple and basic. It's a down to earth story, put into the world of anime, so things aren't completely clear in the end, but the things that aren't too clear are far overshadowed by the mellow dramatic, slice of life, feel good parts. The simple aspect of livin ye lyfe to the fullest at dat darn moment, is fulfilled.\\n\r\nAlso, I won't fail to mention that I did think the characters were a bit too soft. I had a few moments where I was like, \"wow, toughen up... be like that bread lady my gawd.\" \\n\r\nI felt that this anime was very shallow in the feelings department.\\n\\n\r\nOkay honestly I don't know how to feel about this one in the end, because the ending was kind of satisfying, but mehhhhhhhhhhhhhh. Watch this if you're into mellow dramatic, touchy feely anime that has a lot of nostalgia in it. \\n\\n\r\n+ A guide on how to make friends!\\n\r\nHave past experiences, show empathy, learn, and then give each other advice towards one another and then help grow together. Yay we are  fond of each other. Boom, ya gotta group of friends. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading! Have a good mourning/afternoon/night~",

            "content": "I've put off watching Ao Haru Ride for a while. I was curious about it but it didn't really stood out from my anime line up. So, needless to say I watched it with low expectations. \r\nIt's a shoujo, slice of life  romance about a girl who met her first love again after three years. Only, the boy she met was way different from the boy she knew three years ago. \r\nWell, like I mentioned before, I had low expectations for the anime because once you've noticed the shoujo romance formula, almost every other shoujo romance would start to look the same. \r\nAdmittedly, AoHaru Ride did have that formula ( isolated herione + cool hero + new found real friends + angst + romance + school life e.g. Sukitte Ii Na Yo/ Kimi ni Todoke). Ang even though it did, I was still able to enjoy the show. \\n\\n\r\nIt didn't make me feel like I was swallowing sickly sweet syrup like other romance anime did (Wow. Good job on the metaphor). In a sense, it gave me a pleasant feeling. Like, seeing my crush for the first time (Whoa! another metaphor. I'm on a roll!) But seriously, I love how the romance between Futaba and Kou is not cringey. It's wholesome and youthful, it's the \"first love\" kind of feeling. Ahhhh~ it gave me so many dokis.\\n\\n\r\nThe story was heart warming and tragic but also very relatable. It gives the viewers a lesson on changing for the better, starting over and the value of friendship (of course).\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are well written, but I just can't bring myself to like Kominato and Makita. However, that's a matter of preference. \\n\\n\r\nAside from Futaba and Kou, I was also compelled by Shuuko and Tanaka-sensei's characters and their relationship. These two pairs are my otp. \\n\\n\r\nFinally, let me just say that I loved the last episode like ho-lee-sheet. Kou-kun give me a hug!\\n\\n\r\nNow if you'll excuse me, it's 7:30 am and I'm going to bed. I pulled an all nighter for this anime. And the first thing I'll do when I wake up is look for and read the manga.",

The characters in general are very good, the highlight even goes to the main couple, showing very naturally the qualities and defects of each of them (although, the way the Futaba Yoshioka acts with the school boys at the beginning of the story isa bit exaggerated).The animation is well done for a shoujo genre (the design of the characters and some background scenes are very beautiful) and the sound part is very good too, fitting in a very harmonic way in the context of the anime. One thing not good is that the anime does not have a closed end (chances for a second season are minimal, unfortunately), having to go to the manga to know how the whole story ends (I hate when it happens!).\\n\\n\r\nPORT: se eu resumisse esse anime em poucas palavras seria: que casal mais fofo! A hist\u00f3ria gira em torno da descoberta do amor entre os dois personagens principais, ela funciona bem para uma hist\u00f3ria de drama e romance ( possui algumas cenas muito bem feita por sinal), mas tamb\u00e9m n\u00e3o traz grandes novidades para esse tipo de hist\u00f3ria. Os personagens no geral s\u00e3o muito bons, o destaque mesmo vai para o casal principal, mostrando de forma bem natural as qualidades e defeitos de cada um deles ( apesar que a maneira como a Futaba Yoshioka age com os garotos da escola no in\u00edcio da hist\u00f3ria \u00e9 um pouco exagerado). A anima\u00e7\u00e3o est\u00e1 bem competente para um g\u00eanero shoujo ( o design dos personagens e alguns ambientes de fundo est\u00e3o muito bonito) e a parte sonora est\u00e1 muito boa tamb\u00e9m, se encaixando de forma bem harm\u00f4nica no contexto do anime.

            "content": "Ao Haru Ride does something that most shoujo anime adaptations fail to do, and that is allowing itself to be honest and mature, denying superficiality in the way it handles its core themes. It does so with grace and precision, allowing the viewer to observe and understand the reasons for a character acting a certain way and then letting them reflect upon it. This provides it with significant emotional horsepower that propels the characters and the plot forward in an incredibly satisfying fashion. As a whole, this isn't so much a love story as it is a story about grief, friendship, and allowing oneself togrow as a person by acknowledging and accepting your past, no matter how dark it may be; not every relationship is about attraction and frivolous personality traits, some are built on hardship and the strength required to overcome it. Ao Haru Ride exemplifies this in a way most shoujo do not, while still undeniably remaining a \"shoujo\" anime.\\n\\n\r\nThis development is primarily seen in the male protagonist Mabuchi Kou, a mysterious soft-spoken boy who moved away from his middle school due to unknown reasons. Now in high school, the main female protagonist Yoshioka Futaba, whom once liked Kou, meets him again and attempts to find out what caused him to become almost the antithesis to his former self in his personality and affinity to those around him. That's the main plot in a nutshell, and while yes, there is romance involved, it's not the anime's primary focus, particularly as by the end that story thread is left inconclusive. It is primarily focused on Kou's past and how he is a very damaged person incapable of opening up, and how he grows to become someone who can do so fearlessly through the help of Futaba. While this is the case, the anime is shown from her perspective and how she also deals with anxiety and doubt, particularly struggling to find friends she can truly bond with who understand her insecurities. This becomes a major theme in the show, particularly in the beginning, and interweaves with the show's main focus in a very satisfyingly elegant way. These two protagonists have brilliant chemistry and you can't help but root for them from the very beginning of the first episode. While Ao Haru Ride excels in what it wants to say and get across, it also has a very attractive but conventional shoujo artstyle and coloring along with a very good soundtrack that places similar musical motifs throughout effectively. \\n\\n\r\nI find that the anime's main weakness is in that of the supporting cast. In fact, that name suits these relatively one-dimensional characters all-too-well; they are there only to support the main characters and not much else. While there are exceptions, most of them go through little character development over the course of the show and only appear when it is convenient for the plot. While not a large negative and pretty much a mainstay of most if not all anime and other general media, it can get distracting at times. Again, the way Ao Haru Ride handles them is nowhere near as bad as other anime, so I didn't find it to be something that brought it down as a whole. I would also find fault in the general creativity of the anime. If I had to describe it in one way, I'd say that Ao Haru Ride is the quintessential shoujo anime because it's a very generic depiction of what shoujo \"should be\" but done in an outstanding way. While other shoujo anime/manga like Orange have creative aspects to them, Ao Haru Ride doesn't and thus may deter certain viewers for being exactly \"too generic\".\\n\\n\r\nI truly respect Ao Haru Ride, both the adaptation and the source material, for being very honest and mature work considering the genre it's placed under. It deals with some heavy topics such as depression, social anxiety, and how grief can make someone change themselves in a self-destructive way. However, it directly combats these darker themes with lighter ones such as forgiveness and acceptance, making it a perfect and rewarding blend of uplifting and serious. It can be deeply realistic and relatable at certain points to those who have experienced similar trauma to that of the characters, and that is to be commended. I can comfortably say that Ao Haru Ride is my favorite shoujo anime because of the beauty and elegance of its presentation, allowing one to feel and understand the guilt, trauma, and eventual absolution that its characters go through while providing a rewarding, respectful payoff.",

            "content": "I was craving a good romance story after a long time without them, and seeing how many people praised Ao Haru Ride, I decided to give it a go. I liked the premise and the characters seemed like they were going to be great people for whom I could feel for. Sadly, I got absolutely nothing.\r\nStory:\r\nThe story of Ao Haru Ride is pretty simple and straightforward. Two people, Futaba Yoshioka and Kou Mabuchi, who used to be in love with each other meet up again after three years. The girl notices the boy has changed and tries to conclude whether or not she still hasfeelings for him.\\n\r\nThere is nothing about this premise that makes me roll my eyes as long as it is done correctly, but this was not the case here. I wasn't expecting a masterpiece when I started this, I wasn't expecting an anime that will stick with me for days. I was simply expecting a sweet story about a boy and a girl finding their way back to each other. \\n\r\nI did not get that. In fact, I didn't really get anything. They are not finding their way back to each other, they are not even trying. It has mostly been a story about the Futaba crying how Kou has changed, and Kou telling Futaba how much she has changed. It was fine the first two times they mentioned it, but it was severely overused.\\n\r\nI guess someone must have realized this alone will not make for a good story, so they decided to push a friendship group subplot. Again, it's something I have no problems with, but I have a lot of problems with this specific friendship group. I don't understand why they are friends other than for the simple reason to have friends. They don't seem to have any shared interests, they don't seem to enjoy each other's company that much. They simply exist in the same place and time. \\n\r\nThis anime is, however, supposed to be character driven, so I didn't let the story alone determine my score, even though the story was almost non existent, but I still gave it a 6/10.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nProduction I.G. has once again done a really good job with animation. The style is sweet, enhanced with a color palette that matches a slice of life anime. The pastel-like colors while showing flashbacks were a nice touch as well. I did feel like the chibi style was a bit overused, but it didn't bother me too much. I haven't noticed any drops in quality over the course of the show, which is why I gave the art an 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nOpening and Ending songs were fine. Nothing special, nothing that will stick with me, but they were good songs for this particular anime. As for the rest of the soundtrack throughout the show, I am very conflicted as to what exactly to say. \\n\r\nSome songs were such a good hit in a specific moment, enhancing the emotion trying to be shown. If it weren't for them, there would be absolutely no moment of this show that made me feel, but like I said, they really did a great job at choosing at which point to start playing which song. Of course, this is a double-edged sword, as some songs seemed were put in moments that were already overly dramatic, and the songs just enhanced all of that and it felt like I was left with so much melodrama that was completely unnecessary. \\n\r\nWhen it comes to voice acting, I had no problems with it. It wasn't remarkable, but it was done well, which is why my final grade for the sound is 5/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nWhen you go into a character driven story, you expect the characters to be intriguing and entertaining. It makes me sad to say that this was definitely not the case here. \\n\r\nLet's start with Futaba, our female lead. Futaba is first shown as this cute, little girl whose problem is the fact that she is too cute. She is so cute, that every girl in her middle school got angry at her and stopped talking to her. She decided she wanted to make friends in high school, so she changed into a girl who doesn't comb her hair and eats a lot. A really huge change, I know.\\n\r\nSeeing how she is the main character of this show, you'd expect her to have a big role, but I just didn't get that impression. She was bland and went through minimal development. From time to time, it seemed as if the only point of having her in the show was to develop Kou, which isn't a bad thing in itself, but it becomes really bad since she is supposed to be a main character. \\n\\n\r\nMoving on to Kou, who also managed to make me so mad. I liked him at the beginning. I knew from the get-go that his cold demeanor was just a mask and I was really looking forward to finding out why exactly that was the case. But sadly, I barely got anything. Turns out, he really is just a moody, cold, quiet, 'caring only brings suffering' type of a person. That is, he is that way right until the end, when he suddenly changes because Futaba made him see how much good there is in the world. \\n\\n\r\nAnd that brings me to another part of the anime which I just don't understand. I picked this up because it says romance and because I liked the premise, but I got nothing when it comes to the relationship. It had no development, it wasn't believable, there simply wasn't anything there. If this anime didn't have a romance tag, I would have no problems with this, but I was expecting a lot more in regards to this. \\n\\n\r\nI'll just briefly mention the 4 other characters who were kind of relevant to the story, but also not really. \\n\r\nWe have Yuuri who is a cute girl who every other girls hates because of it. Sounds familiar? Yes, I know. \\n\r\nMurao is a cold girl who has a crush on a teacher and doesn't like hanging out with people from her class. Until she becomes a part of the group we follow and then suddenly starts to like hanging out just like that, completely out of the blue and incredibly out of character.\\n\r\nI don't even know what the point of Kominato is. He is a part of the friend group, but it seemed like he was there simply so they could have another boy in there.\\n\r\nAnd finally, we have Tanaka, Kou's older brother and the only character from this anime which I actually liked. There wasn't even anything that special about him, but compared to everyone else, he seemed like a person who had a reason to be in this story. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI enjoyed the first two or three episodes. I really did, and I was looking forward to watching everything and finding out more about the characters and seeing how their story will end. But with time, my enjoyment just completely went away. There was nothing going on that made me interested and I got so bored, which is saying a lot considering how short this anime is. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nEven though I came into this with very little expectations despite so many good reviews, I still got nothing. I got no romance, I went into a character driven story and was given completely bland characters and a bunch of unnecessary characters. The sound and animation were ultimately the only thing that saved this anime, so it gets a 4/10 from me.",

            "content": "To be fair, I may be a little biased because I was in the mood to see a cute shoujo anime. What I liked about this was that the interactions between the two characters are much more natural than in most anime of the sort. Yes, she blushes and cries, he knocks her on the head, calling her \"baka\", but the flow feels way more normal than your usual anime and they don't \"combust\" if they touch hands :P\r\nStory - 8 Because yes, it has its tropes and it is pretty typical, but it has its depth and, as I said, a good overall flowto it. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 9 I really liked how the characters were drawn, very cute expressions and the splashes of watercolors in the memory scenes were a very nice touch!  \\n\\n\r\nSound 9 - The intro is really catchy and stays with you and the sountrack complemented the story and highlighted the major points. Also, their voices were very nice and some of her replies when upset/flustered/embarrassed were extremely cute. Also, his laugh...:) \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8 - Only 8 because not all characters had the required depth, there were a few tropes and stereotypes, but overall they were extremely likable \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10 - Very cute and fun, with a tinge of darkness and sorrow and well depicted adolescent confusion that leaves room for both errors and drama, but also growth and sweetness  :) \\n\\n\r\nOverall 9 - Because it felt cut short and I wanted more...it actually leaves room for more (the following OVA brings a bit more but still not enough). Then again, it is a high mark because, since the manga was ongoing and it only had 12 episodes, it managed to leave its mark.\\n\\n\r\nFor those who compare it to Kimi ni Todoke (and especially those who find it to be less) I have to say i can't find the resemblance, except, maybe, the fact they were both from the same period, treating the high school romance theme like many, many others. Also, Kimi ni todoke had a greater hype built around it, much more money invested in it and more episodes which made it possible for the public to enjoy more content and develop story end characters further. I, for one was not overly impressed by that one and prefer Ao Haru Ride. \\n",

That's what Ao Haru Ride's main plot surrounds itself in. The story starts with our main character, Futaba Yoshioka, falls in love with a boy named Kou Tanaka, they planned to go on a date together one spring night but Kou never showed up on the night of their date, leaving Futaba disappointed. Kou transferred school during the spring season and they never meet again, not until few years later that Futaba meets up with Kou again in their high school.But this Kou is completely a different Kou that she used to know, leaving her wondering what makes Kou such a different person than the one that she loved. The story in this anime is \"Cute\" from my perspective, it doesn't have a big twist or a shocking moment, it's just a generic love story with some cuties moments. (But it's still better than some romcom anime). The art in this anime is gorgeous and the voice actors done a every excellent job to express the characters' emotions. The soundtracks for this anime is amazing, I immediately went to download the whole soundtracks after i finished the first episode. The characters are likable especially Futaba and Kou, they are very well developed in my opinion. Overall, I really like this anime, it's an enjoyable anime. 8/10",

However, I must say there were many ridiculous WTF how did that just happen, cheesy, and overly dramatic moments in this series, especially in the beginning. I was actually very tempted to drop the anime after 3 episodes but if you bear with the terrible opening episodes you'll come to enjoy the rest of the series. I didn't really like the MC's Futaba Yohioka or Kou Tanaka/Mabuchi but I liked their budding chemistry and enjoyed their subtle romantic moments. Oh but I thought the third wheel Makita Yuri was EXTREMELYANNOYING. I hated how she acts cute and pretends to be innocent while lusting after Kou. She really just needs to get over herself and accept the fact that someone else deserves her crush better than her. Also, I hated Kou's lethargic voice because I thought it was overdone, but then later discovered that the seiyuu for Kou also voiced Kenma from Haikyuu! which changed my disposition. I freakin love Haikyuu so the fact that Kou's seiyuu also voiced a character from my favorite anime made Kou's boring voice more bearable to listen to~ :D hehe. ... But overall this was a charming shoujo anime. If you're looking to watch a short anime filled with sweet moments, then I recommend checking out Ao Haru Ride.",

The show starts out strong- a lot of progress is made in the first few episodes, but it wastes its head start by slightly lagging towards the middle and end. There are some sweet heart-throbbing moments peppered here and there. \r\nI am obsessed with Kou. He is a hot guy with a sexy, husky voice. Kudos to his seiyuu! Seriously, I wish all shoujo guys sounded like him. Kou is also sort of a tsundere and can occasionally actlike a jerk. \\n\\n\r\nFutaba, the female lead, is persistent when it comes to trying to get Kou to open up. I don\u2019t like her character design as much as Kou\u2019s design; her eyes are super round and a bit too far apart. But that\u2019s just me. \\n\\n\r\nThe side characters aren\u2019t anything to write home about. I honestly didn\u2019t care about them at all (though they do get a bit more development in the manga).  \\n\\n\r\nThe OP is really cute and catchy. \\n\\n\\n",

I love that the female lead has a specific, cute fetish about the MC, I really related to that. She also has a great character - funny, sweet, conflicted. The female relationships are also very relatable - it was heartening to see truly good hearts find each other and overcome many of the aspects of teenage life that would normally pull friendships apart. Overall, very relatable, really enjoyable, very funny in parts too!",

            "content": "I'm very, very annoyed with Ao Haru Ride at the moment. I write this whilst hitting my head against a proverbial brick wall, wondering why I wasted four hours of my PRECIOUS life watching such a limp anime when so many of my friends told me to avoid it. I just had to be a rebel, didn't I?\r\nI've got nothing against the shoujo demographic, romance or slice of life - I actually really enjoy it when its done well. Unfortunately, this was absolutely not the case with Ao Haru Ride. It spent 9-10 episodes doing nothing but play endless feeling ping-pong. Some semblance of aplot didn't actually kick in until episode 11, but by then it was too late because that was the penultimate episode of the anime. The story was so limp that the cheese dangling in front a mouse plot device used at the end of episode 12 did not excite me an ounce, because by the time the thing was finished I was barely paying attention.\\n\\n\r\nI know this is a slice-of-life anime thus it isn't really meant to have an overarching plot because it's more about the characters, than the story. But when an anime has characters as flat, shallow and soulless as the ones in AHR the anime has a big problem. \\n\\n\r\nThere was hardly any character development from any of the characters outside of the main pair. The supporting cast were frankly irrelevant and a waste of screen time. I didn't know any of their names and you could have swapped others in their place and I probably wouldn't have noticed.\\n\\n\r\nKou was the only one who had significant character development and it wasn't anything exciting at all. You see, despite what some will say about him, Kou is nothing but a 16 year-old arsehole with angst issues. His character trajectory is supposed to make us feel like he's something else, but he doesn't even have a trajectory that makes him redeemable. Everyone else around him is doing all the hard work whilst he's just stringing them along and confusing them emotionally - this is especially the case with Futaba. \\n\\n\r\nI know the difficult time he went through affected his personalit, but it isn't any justification for how he treated people. What he did was morally reprehensible: he always played push-and-pull games with people, without giving a second thought towards their feelings. I've seen people do that in real life and TRUST ME when I say that it doesn't end well. Nobody will put up with that shit for a long time - no matter how much they care about you - because people like Kou are highly taxing on one's emotional stability.\\n\\n\r\nI'm annoyed with Futaba for loving Kou, but, otherwise, I actually like her. I think she's got some horrible taste in friends and men, but she's honest and she's got guts. I'm glad that she finally realised it's okay to be yourself, and be hated for it, instead of being loved for who you aren't. Her character development was incredibly short though, and she stagnated after the fourth episode. Nevertheless, she was the gem in the dust and I saw aspects of myself in her at times.\\n\\n\r\nMakita Yuuri is the only supporting character I'm going to talk about because, for about 30 seconds, she was a plot pusher. The other lot are so irrelevant I can't even remember their faces (and I finished the anime just over an hour ago). I have no problems with cute characters, but Yuuri wasn't cute she was just plain sly. She says it herself, at the very beginning, that she only acts cute because she wants male attention and appreciation. Not only is that incredibly sly, but it sends out an absolutely awful message to young girls (and boys). I also don't get why Yuuri and Futaba are such \"precious\" friends - asides from being hated by girls for being cute, what do you they really have in common? Their relationship was so superficial. I also didn't like how Yuuri could be so foxy and pragmatic when it came to Kou, but could get away with it because she acted like a three year old. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and music in AHR might have been really pretty, but that doesn't detract away from the anime's clear and undeniable flaws that obviously impact on one's enjoyment factor. You can't save an anime from the poorly construed characters that are supposed to hold the show together.",

A male and a female. The male asks out said female.  She would have accepted but for some reason indirectly rejects him while trying to deny the crush she has for said boy.  He goes away and then they are reunited as high school students.  So she tries everything in her power to try to get them to start going out as they should have in high school but onething leads to another and he says he doesnt have those feelings for her anymore.  So she tries to make him fall in love with her and that's basically the entire story.  \\n\\n\r\nNow i don't know too much about the female's mindset but granted that the story was told from the perspective of the female protagonist Yoshioka Futaba. there is a lot for me to ponder about this show.  Personally because i don't understand the whole thing about love and relationships and crap.  (pardon my french)  \\n\\n\r\nUltimately i wanted to put a boot in her face and watch her bleed out.  But for someone who knows how this stuff works, i would both recommend you watch it, and then explain to me how her mind is working.  That would be appreciated.    \\n",

            "content": "I know the opinions differ but I still think this is a great anime coming out of my re-watch. In it's 12 episodes it manage to make me care for it's characters, cry for it's characters and it also makes my heart race. It had a very small amount of problems for me, one of them being that it's too short, which is, of course not something that you can call criticism, just greediness on my part.\r\nNO SPOILERS AHEAD\r\nNow, I know it's not really a very original story. It shows things that you find in a loooot of shoujo anime, but to me it showsexactly those things that I like about shoujo anime compared to other kinds of fiction. It is character driven, sweet and thinks it's choices and moralities through. It's not just a big ball of hormones like a lot of American entertainment is. \\n\r\nPersonally I started watching this in an attempt to fill the void that kimi ni todoke left. I found another sweet story in this anime. I love it's philosophy, and even though I can see the cliche's, they don't bother me that much. It shows me things that I wish I'd have the power to do: drawing people out and drawing people in, with trying, caring and a little guts.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\r\nSo we have a good female MC, Futuba I like how she feels like a teenager, caving into the temptation and pretending to be who her friends think she is. I also like that she has courage. She has some great character development and is overall fun to watch while she balances her behavior between what her habits tell her to do versus what she wants to do. The male MC is lovable, he pretends not to care but obviously does, well, you know the type, imagine that stereotypical male MC with a great dry voice actor, actual backstory and then ten times better and you have our Kou. There are some other characters that don't get a lot of development but what do you want in 12 episodes?\\n\\n\r\nPHILOSOPHY\\n\r\nNow I realize this is shoujo anime and that philosophy is barely relevant, but to me it matters a great deal if a story has something to teach me or something for me to wonder about. In the anime we see a couple of flashbacks to the Kou and Futaba in middle school, when they started to like each other. In those flashbacks they are both very different from the way they are when we get to know them. This is something I find very interesting personally, whether the fact that people change matters to the ones who really love them. Isn't unconditional love very illogical? If characteristics don't matter anymore what is it that we love? When you love someone who's changed, does that mean that you love them as someone new entirely? Or is there something in people that is always there, no matter how much they change? Or does loving them mean that you're just waiting for the person they were to come out again? Ao Haru Ride doesn't give you any answers but it does have a nice story about two characters who experience real change but either still love each other and/or learn to love each other the way they are now.\\n\\n\r\nART AND SOUND \\n\r\nThe art is really great, it's just really pretty. It has nice body proportions, backgrounds, there are no animation issues that sprung out at me, it also has fantastic facial expressions. \\n\r\nI really love the music, too, I like the theme song and the song they end with, but it also has a beautiful soundtrack that is alternated with the amazing song \"I will\". The voice actors were also very good. \\n\\n\r\nSo I think you get that I liked it a lot. Don't watch this if you're looking for something different and original. But if you're looking for a short, sweet and well-executed love story you should watch this :) It won't take long so enjoy it while it lasts. Oh and watch the extra \"unwritten\" episodes, it might give you a little more closure.\\n",

            "content": "I just rewatched the entire show in a matter of two days. I did so because someone asked me if I had seen it and wanted to know my opinion. I couldn't remember the story or if I liked it, so I decided to watch it again. That right there is a red flag, because I normally remember most anime I watch. The pace of this anime is kind of slow, even for the slice of life genre. The beginning is a bit confusing because you're not quite sure if the two main characters know each other, but that's fine, we get the gist ofthis story arc by episode three.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is dreamy and sort of washed out in watercolors, very easy on the eyes.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are developed well enough, but kind of one dimensional. Kou is interesting, though he made me mad many times.  Futaba sort of just took his emotional beatings without worry of her own self. If she were a real person/friend, I would tell her to leave him for being so mean to her. \\n\\n\r\nSomeone mentioned not liking the voice of the female lead... My advice is to stop watching it in dub! Seriously.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I thought it was pretty good, not really great though. I Enjoyed this more as a story of friendship, not so much a romance, mainly because it's a bit disappointing as a romance.",

That said, every moment of this was beautiful, the romance scenes were on point, no complaints whatsoever, I REGRET NOTHING! Really good (cuuute) OST, melts my heart every time. This whole anime melted my heart.\r\nOverall [10/10] - All of the above, great character development, really shows Kou embracing his feelings and becoming more open, and oh man the romantic scenes were so good... Really brilliant anime, will never forget it,and will probably re-watch! Also, to anyone who hasn't, read the manga! You're missing out (since it looks like there may not be a season 2, even though I hate to say it)!",

It's rather sad because after the first episode I thought it was going to be amazing and couldn't wait to see what else this anime had in store.  But as more characters were introduced and time went on, the anime seemed to move so slow, and unfortunately became boring.  The ending, while I won't give anything away, just didn't at all feel like a proper ending.  While there are no cliffhangers or gripping questions and no one is onthe edge of their seat, the audience is left hungry as if all twelve episodes were all for naught.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully, there exists a side story to this anime.  The OVA episode called \"Page 13\" of this anime contains the true ending that probably would raise this series' overall score by a whole point.  I recommend that episode more than I recommend half the episodes in the main series.",

The story's pacing and character development is pretty good in my opinion. \r\nThe art, especially the scenic views in this anime is exceptionally breathtaking that I wish I was there. The characters are well drawn as well, much identical to the manga. For the sound, it was a good listen. The OSTs used in here is very good and addictive. So, no complains here as well.\r\nOverall, I give this a solid 10/10 andI really recommend this anime to everyone out there because it is sure to remind you of your high school life and how some events are relatable to our daily lives.\\n",

They were both in love with each other but one day Futaba said something to someone trying to bother her. She said she hated all boys, while Kou was coming out of the classroom. Kou was supposed to meet her at a park Futaba showed up but Kou never did. Kou moved to another city due to family problems and was disconnected from Futaba and his friends. A few years later passed now Futaba is in Highschool she one day bumps into a boy thatlooked like Kou but due to family problems he changed his last name so they called him Mabuchi. Futaba was embarassed that she was \"mistakened\" but, she wasn't. She later finds out that was actually the boy she once loved and he has moved back into to town. She finds out by hiding under a shrine while it was raining between some walls she discovers Kou there also and that how she confirmed that was the real Kou and he has changed a lot; personality wise and looks wise. It made them both nostalgic because during 7th/8th grade when they were both in love they were hiding in the exact same place.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIn this series it takes about love complications and growing a bond with each other from people who were disconnected, anti social, and alone. To being a group of good friends together later on in the series. In the anime it doesn't have a season 2 but it leaves off in the manga at chapter 15. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe manga has lots of harem/drama and is very beautiful is you love the Ao Haru Ride series give a manga a go to finish the whole series.",

            "content": "Story:\r\nStandard shojo highschool setting, don't expect anything new in that direction. The backstory and connection of the two main characters stands out. Especially the past of the male lead takes an unusual route and creates interesting character dynamics.\r\nArt:\r\nGood, nothing that takes you out of it. That's about it.\r\nSound:\r\nThe OST of this anime is surprisingly good and fits the overall theme well. Absolutly no complaints here.\r\nCharacter:\r\nThe cast of characters is well mixed and the amount of character development satisfying and realistic in terms of anime. Still there are some clich\u00e9 characters but this can be expected. I especially liked Kou's brother as his troubles dealing withhim and one of his studends were believable and made him relatable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nWhile the anime was pleasant to watch, the slow pase of story and character develpment meant, that in the end not much changed. Or rather that there was no time left for it to take effect. With a slightly faster pace or a couple of episodes more there could have been a satisfying ending. As for the actual ending you are left without any closure. This transforms what could have been a sweet 12 episode anime into an unfullfilling teaser for the manga, that leaves you with a hollow feeling.\\n\\n\r\nTLDR:\\n\r\nWith a more fullfilling ending (that still could have left room for the manga / a second season) I would have given this anime a 8/10 as a great, even though somewhat vanilla, experience. Sadly its ending drops all the momentum to the floor and leaves you rather unsatisfied considering how well it all started.",
