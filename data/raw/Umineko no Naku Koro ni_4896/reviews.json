            "content": "A few things before reading this review:\r\n\t-yes, I am one of those who have played the sound novel before watching the anime;\r\n\t-no, I will not make this an essay of comparison between the two, nor will I praise the novel over the anime; however, it is inevitable that certain comparisons will indeed appear, in order to explain the flaws of the anime;\r\n\t-this review might seem a bit unfriendly to someone who has no clue what Umineko is about. In fact, it's much more addressed to those who have partially or completely watched the anime/read the manga/played the game.\r\n\tLet me begin with a simple assertion. Uminekoas an anime is a bad experience. Note that I did not say horrendous nor terrible. The Umineko anime is not at all a complete train-wreck, despite all the hatred it receives from the fandom; it's simply nothing more than mediocre. In other terms, it feels similar to trying to bend a very detailed paper figurine in a jar that's too small and ruining it in the process. Yes, the figurine was remarkable beforehand. But no, it did not remain so afterward.\\n\r\n\tThere are two main reasons why the Umineko anime doesn't work:\\n\r\n\t-adaptation decay (butchering of the characters and the plot for time's convenience) and\\n\r\n\t-the very little effort Studio DEEN put into making it (bad graphics, right music at the wrong time, wrong character designs, overall wrong atmosphere).\\n\\n\r\n\tBUTCHERING OF THE CHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\n\tOne of Umineko's main put-offs is the fact that is has such a large cast of characters. You cannot help but forget who is who, who is related to whom, where someone popped out of, what the purpose of a certain character is and so on and so forth. The adaptation from the novel to the anime meant losing a lot of development for plot's sake, and that really adds to the overall confusion. Except for the very main two characters (Battler and Beatrice), almost all the other characters are uni-dimensional. Name one word that relates to Rosa - abusive. One that defines Maria? Whiny. One for Ronove? Cookies. See the point?\\n\r\n\tWhile it becomes (or should become) clear after a while that in the wit game of Umineko, the humans are nothing more that chess pieces and the witches are simply devices to advance the arguments, that isn't an excuse. Why should you watch something where you don't care for any of the characters? Again, this is still the adaptation's fault. The original source material, while still keeping a few members of the cast undeveloped (I'm looking at you, Hideyoshi and Nanjo), at least managed to make all the characters likeable \u2013 therefore less likely to suspect. The anime didn't retain that; quite the opposite. You end up feeling exasperated most of the time by almost everybody. \\n\r\n\tNow onto the main characters: Battler and Beatrice.\\n\\n\r\nBattler: \\n\r\n\t-supposed to be the epitome of manliness, logic and determination [novel];\\n\r\n\t-ended up being the most delusional of them all (ironically), has huge shoujo eyes and most of the times doesn't make any sense at all [anime].\\n\\n\r\nBeatrice: \\n\r\n\t-complex character, acts all cruel, rough and unrefined in the beginning, but manages to melt halfway through and create a friendship/rivalry bond with Battler, to the point of finally being able to transmit to him the purpose of her existence [novel];\\n\r\n\t-complete bitch who takes a 180 turn in the last episode and goes all helpless moe moe kyun for no reason [anime].\\n\\n\r\n\tBUTCHERING OF THE PLOT\\n\\n\r\n\tLike it or not, the original Umineko story is damn complex, a complete, subtle mindfuck, in fact. Perhaps that is why it doesn't work that well in the visual format of the anime. Anime watchers are used to taking something literally as it is. Umineko was not supposed to be like that \u2013 hence even the unfriendly red text. Unfortunately, Studio DEEN didn't manage to clear the misconception at all. To get to the point:\\n\r\n\tOne of the main questions that arose while experiencing Umineko (both in the sound novel and the anime form) was this \u2013 why the heck would Battler try to deny the existence of the witch when she's obviously sitting in front of him, cackling inelegantly and hitting him in the head with her pipe? It seems utterly ridiculous and pointless. A complete waste of time.\\n\r\n\tHowever, that is not the case. The novel, having the advantage of underlining concepts in a textual form, managed to clear this. The anime didn't. To explain further on:\\n\\n\r\n\tSay Mary (Beatrice) is a multimillionaire and Ben (Battler) is a salary-man. There is a great business plan (the murders) going to unfold. Ben claims that you can manage that business with an amount of experience similar to the one he has (logic). Mary claims that you can only do it with a lot of money (magic). They decide to settle this in a game of monopoly (the anti-fantasy vs. anti-mystery game). \\n\r\n\tNow obviously, in a game of monopoly there are restrictions. You can only play with monopoly money. Had Mary played with real-life money, Ben would have absolutely no chance of winning. That's why, Mary's moves are restricted as well. It's a completely fair game.\\n\r\n\tProving the point, basically Battler doesn't have to deny magic, period. He would never be able to do that, with Beatrice appearing in front of him and whatnot. He has to deny magic on the 4th and 5th of October 1986 in Rokkenjima, based on the fake scenarios created by Beatrice. It's logical, it's fair and with the right ideas, it doesn't contradict itself at all, quite the opposite. That is the whole fun and magic of Umineko.\\n\\n\r\n\tOf course, some might say, how the heck were the viewers supposed to know this with the anime not explaining it? Unfortunately, by the explanations being cut, they simply could not know it. The novel had a lot of detailed sidelong concepts to help the whole logic battle (chessboard turning, Hempel's raven, Schr\u00f6dinger's cat box) which the anime only briefly mentioned and never insisted on. In other words, a mystery which seemed barely solvable in the novel isn't solvable at all in the anime. That's why, if you're watching Umineko expecting to get a straightforward, definite answer, you won't get it. Which is sad, considering that the main purpose of Umineko was to make you have a brainstorming session. Besides, when in an anime you have to consult additional sources to realize what the heck is going on, that in itself is a problem. I'd say watch Umineko for some other aspects than the mystery, but honestly, there's nothing more to watch if for. And that is Studio DEEN's fault.\\n\\n\r\n\tEXCESSIVE FANSERVICE, COMPLETELY UNRELATED HIGURASHI ATMOSPHERE, UNSYMMETRYCAL EARS: I'm looking at you, Studio DEEN\\n\\n\r\n\tThat's exactly as the title says. You could feel that the staff members of Studio DEEN were completely desperate by simply throwing a glance at the DVD covers. Or by the excessive amount of cleavage in all the female character designs (minus Bernkastel, who, funnily enough, did have quite the bust in the original material). It's very likely that DEEN themselves realized the Umineko anime was bad as it is; and that they had no other plans in which to compensate that.\\n\r\n\tNow I don't have anything against this particular studio; but you as a viewer could definitely sense that they screwed up. There is a famous screenshot in which Eva has a huge ear on one side of her head as opposed to the tiny one on the other side. That goes beyond the excuse of lack of funds. It's simply not caring for. The other main mistake is probably the fact that DEEN tried to promote this as a Higurashi sequel as much as they could to be able to milk money out of the fans. Why should Maria have the Hinamizawa syndrome eyes? They are irrelevant and out of place. Why must there be those weird sideways camera angles? And that emphasis on the gruesome death scenes instead of, say, the reactions of the living (much more important to the plot themselves)?\\n\r\n\tAs for the art, while not being overly-pretentious, it manages to be above barely watchable. In fact, it's a nice change from the shiny shiny artwork nowadays. Still, it doesn't rise above the overall mediocrity of the execution itself.\\n\\n\r\n\tLet's stop this lament at once, though. For Umineko also has certain redeeming characteristics, though not enough. To name them:\\n\r\n\t-the music. Yes, used mostly inconsistently, but taken as a whole, very good music. However, that is still thanks to the sound novel tracks remixes;\\n\r\n\t-OH! DESIRE. A perfect ED theme. Almost as if it was the studio's message of 'You want to get trolled? Well get trolled till the end, then!';\\n\r\n\t-OP theme;\\n\r\n\t-good, fitting voices for the characters (surprisingly, Shannon's voice actress managed to suit her personality really well).\\n\\n\r\n\tENJOYMENT AND OVERALL\\n\\n\r\n\tUmineko anime can basically be defined as a great story with a horrible execution. And that is not right; for, on an anime market with a lot of mediocre stories with great  visual/audio/atmosphere candies, Umineko is exactly the opposite, being hard to digest. \\n\r\n\tFor a sound novel player, it's a complete session of rage, of 'Why the heck was that cut?' and 'Hey, they did that wrong! Bastards!'.\\n\r\n\tAnd for an anime-only viewer, it's a 'How do I make head or tail of this thing? Eh, never mind, someone's been killed again' reaction chain.\\n\\n\r\n\tTo conclude with, I would recommend Umineko the anime only to those who are new to anime in general and have only watched around 20-30 series so far. More experimented watchers would definitely be able to sense the plot holes and lack of affective implication. And they will not enjoy that.\\n\r\n\t(As a small parenthesis, this is quite opposed to my recommendation of the novel/manga; I recommend the novel/manga to absolutely anyone. Read it and you won't regret it.)",

            "content": "One must remember that the Umineko no Naku Koro ni anime is an adaptation. While the anime in itself may not necessarily warrant harsh scores of 2 or 3, in comparison to its source material, it is extremely, extremely lacking. I find it inconceivable that anyone could give this series, even if they never read the sound novel, a 9 or 10 out of 10 rating. While the sound novel may not have been a masterpiece, it was intriguing, exciting, and, at times, moving. In its adaptation into an anime, the entire thing was turned into something disgustingly shallow and one-dimensional. \r\nI doubt that anystudio or director would have been able to cram every single detail of the sound novels into 26 episodes. However, the way it was done was nothing but uncouth. \\n\\n\r\nI was looking forward to Umineko from the moment I heard of it. I wasn't a big fan of Higurashi, but the synopsis made it seem reminiscent of my favorite book, And Then There Were None, and more fitting to my tastes in general. After the first five episodes, I couldn't describe it in any way other than \"shallow.\" I hadn't heard of or read the novels at the time, but from the very beginning it felt as though something was missing. I heard the novel really was amazing, though, and sought it out. While there were flaws, the first four episodes of the novel felt much more complete than the anime. The story is mostly reading and the atmosphere is set more by the music rather than the visuals. Despite this, R07 managed to make the experience very enjoyable. After finishing it, I then continued with the anime, hoping it would at least somewhat meet the level the sound novel did. Of course, it didn't come close. \\n\r\nThe anime really has no continuity or flow whatsoever. I found myself asking as the episodes progressed, \"Wait, did they cover event X?\" and holes simply cannot be left in a mystery story (what Umineko is presented as), other than intentional ones. Small things, such as Battler and Beatrice's reactions to each others' actions were left out or glossed over, making the story incredibly superficial. A lot of fun from the sound novel came from these moments between them.\\n\r\nThe meaning behind events happening and secrets slowly unfolding is completely lost. In fact, the fight between Battler and Beatrice, anti-fantasy vs. anti-mystery, might as well not exist in the anime. It's supposed to be a detective/mystery story, albeit a strange one, and not simply that of a fickle witch murdering over a dozen people for fun, which is what the anime turned it into, at least until the very end where it does a rapid, poorly timed 180. Of course, the end was the \"same\" in the sound novel, but then it was clearly thought out and planned. The anime made it seem as if the producers/director forgot all about the end until the last five minutes of the final episode, then shoved it in. \\n\r\nBy the end of the fourth game, one should be able to determine the culprit. By reading the sound novel, I believe this to be possible. I don't see how it could ever be done watching the anime alone.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is something that is clearly hit-or-miss. The main reason people seem to be put off from the sound novel is the \"horrendous\" art. Yes, different heads put on the same body and then turned into different characters. Yes, boxing glove hands. The art of Ryukishi07's works is clearly all about the faces. Whether the art of the anime is better or worse is something I'll let you decide for yourself. However, I think it's unquestionable that the facial expressions of the sound novel are exponentially better than the anime. I won't say that they are drawn well, but something has to be said of bad art that can manage to send chills down spines and make someone not want to read it at night because of frightening expressions. It would be hard for any animator to capture the riveting expressions of the sound novel, however I think they definitely could have tried harder, or at least have done a wider variation. \\n\r\nOf course, the faces weren't the only things animated. Some characters (Rosa) clearly look better than others (Battler), however no one looked totally dreadful, though some people would beg to disagree with that point. In some cases I actually found myself preferring it (Maria actually looks like a nine-year old), but I can't understand why they felt the need change nearly everyone's eye color to blue.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was the most decent thing. The sound of the sound novel was excellent, as to be expected. The music really makes the setting, and even some scenes. The anime remixed some of the songs and used some of the original sound effects. Some fan-favorite songs were left out, but overall they did a decent job in this department.\\n\r\nThe song for the opening was very good; I was happy to see they used Akiko Shikata, who did the opening for the sound novel. While, other than \"yami o kirisaku OH DESIIIIRE,\" I disliked the ending song itself. I found it very fitting for Kinzo, however.\\n\\n\r\nWhile many characters aren't expanded on in the sound novel until Episode 5 and the anime goes up to Episode 4, the anime made it seem as if no one, aside from Battler and Maria, had a personality. Several scenes left out of the anime expand on many of the characters, mainly the adults. Every adult in the anime, aside from Rosa, the cruel, heartless, \"mother of the year,\" might as well have been there to simply add to the body count. For instance, a scene completely left out of the fourth game in the anime, known as the \"Krauss Counter,\" made Krauss (the only adult I actually disliked at the time) likable. While the scene itself was probably the most over-the-top out of them all and not vital to the story (though it actually was part of the group held underground escaping), it made it harder to be suspicious of Krauss, who seemed to care about money more than anything else beforehand. Several scenes that were included were done very poorly, such as Rosa and Maria at the end of the second game and the Sisters of Purgatory, Kyrie, and Rudolf fighting in the third game. It was these many moments centered around the adults that actually made them seem like people rather than warm bodies existing for the sole purpose of dying.\\n\r\nThe characterization is so important to the series. A mystery has three parts to answer: the whodunnit, the howdunnit, and the whydunnit. In this series, its easiest to focus on the whydunnit, as opposed to many other mysteries.\\n\r\nBeatrice says that witches exist and that everyone is being killed by magic. Battler refuses to believe in the existence of witches and magic but can't deny that the murders are happening. If it's not magic, then one of the eighteen has to be the killer. One of the reasons the sound novel is so compelling is that every one of the possible culprits is likable in some way. As the it progresses, you don't want to believe it's any of them, but you know someone has to be guilty. Watching the anime alone, I wouldn't mind suspecting nearly anyone; I'd have no attachment to any of the characters, and therefore the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe saddest thing about this series is that it ruined what is an, if not great, at least enjoyable, story. Those who hated it are missing out on a story they could have gotten to really like. Those who loved it should definitely start reading the sound novel, if anything to read Umineko no Naku Koro ni Chiru, which will probably/hopefully never see an anime adaption.",

            "content": "So here I finally am, the bad guy who is gonna compare the anime of \"Umineko no Naku Koro ni\" against the visual novel.\r\nI was happily waiting for the release of the anime, since I really liked the first four novels. While I wasn\u00b4t expecting TOO much of the story of chapter 1, chapter 2 has underlined my bad feelings......\r\nSTORY:\r\nOverall, they followed the story well. Some keyfacts where sadly left out, like some explanations from Beatrice. Still, nothing too important was left out, but of course, MANY other funny or interesting things are missing; but in the end, you can\u00b4t push a whole book ornovel in a 24 - 26 episode anime.\\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\r\nWhen I saw the first pictures I thought \"OMG WHAT\u00b4S THAT?\", but after seeing it in action, it\u00b4s not so bad as I thought. Still, it can\u00b4t underline some characters like Eva and Beatrice very well, but I say more about that later.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nI always like it when good music from a visual novel is used in the anime again. in Umineko, the recycled old music well and used many new tracks, too. Most of the time, the music is underlining the situation perfectly; but in chapter 1, it started to annoy me that 3 episodes ended with the same track in a row...\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\r\nAnd here we are, at the biggest weakness of this anime.\\n\r\nWhile the parents like Rudolph, Rosa and Eva where intruduced as very nice people in the start of the novel (what changed not so much later), here we got to see only their ugly sides from the start.\\n\\n\r\nEvas \"lovely\" side was completely ignored, making her look like a b**** from the very start until now. Kyrie was nearly completely left out of the picture, even though she already played a good part in chapter 1 and 2, even though she may be the most interesting character out of the parents. The grand personality of Kinzo is nowhere to be seen, you see him crying most of the time. Maria\u00b4s creepyness is so exaggerated that it hurts. Jessica is only presented as a lovesick girl, but not the strong girl she really is.\\n\\n\r\nAbout Battler, he\u00b4s not half as fun as he used to be in the novel, since he\u00b4s reduced to to the tragic hero that has to oppose the witch, even though in the original it wasn\u00b4t like that.\\n\\n\r\nBut the REAL annoyance is about Beatrice.\\n\r\nHer funny, easy to tease character is completely left out, showing only the \"evil witch side\" of her, but not the interesting character she really is. The somewhat \"friendly rivalship\" between her and Battler is completely left out, as well as the fact that Battler calls her \"Beato\" since near the start of chapter 2l.\\n\\n\r\nPartly, the art-style may be at fault as well, I have trouble imagening a sulking or happily laughing Beatrice with the mostly \"serious\" style.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\r\nWhen you ignore that it is an anime to an existing story, it\u00b4s not bad, and I will still continue to watch it, since the really interesting stories are gonna start now.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nEven with the left out things of the story, it would be a great anime, if they only didn\u00b4t screw up the personalities of the characters so bad. Because they did, the story isn\u00b4t what it could be, especially because the relationship between Beatrice and Battler is totally different.\\n\\n\r\nLike that, many potential was thrown away, what makes me quite sad. It might be a good anime in it\u00b4s own way, and I still have hope for the second half, but it is not the \"Umineko no Naku Koro ni\" it should have been.",

            "content": "This is the story of a young creator named Ryukishi07 whose hit visual novel series Higurashi no Naku Koro ni became a hit anime and put him in the spotlight for great things. Hoping to capitalize on Higurashi's success, the same director and studio went to work adapting his spinoff visual novel series, Umineko no Naku Koro ni. Surely we could expect great things would come of it.\r\nWe were dead f*cking wrong.\r\nThis is anime at its most disgustingly deceptive, dragging you through 26 episodes of \"mystery\" and I cannot stress those quotation marks enough because half the time the mystery doesn't even exist. Hell Icould hardly tell what was the meta-world, the real world, the alternative world, THERE IS NO PERSPECTIVE! None! I don't even know where I am half the f*cking time so how the hell would I be expected to know what's going on?!\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are a mess. We're rivaling Geass and Nanoha levels here in characters, and as such signifies, half of them have no personalities. Hell, you see them all die so many times over and over again that you just come to accept that's their purpose in all of this. In fact, there are some characters so f*cking annoying you cheer when its their turn to take the grotesque spill, but it's not even half as enjoyable as it could be because this anime is spammed with so much violence that it makes it seem uninteresting. I have never seen senseless violence become so BORING!\\n\\n\r\nThe art is laughable. Studio Deen has clearly learned nothing from Higurashi, kept the same production values and amped up the facial distortions to a saturation point that makes them entirely unremarkable. Fortunately they kept the original music of the games which is quite good in some case if you can hear it over blood splattering and insane laughter. Oh, and another rare prop to this series for Sayaka Oohara's performance. I wonder if she got drunk before coming in on days to voice Umineko. I hope so. She at least made it halfway entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nBut the real kicker is we aren't even close to solving any of the mysteries by the end of this and it ends with WAIT FOR SEASON 2 LOL. Now some of you may say \"Hey Splitter! You gave Higurashi's first season a 9 and it did the same thing!\" Yes it did, but it also got closer to the truth every episode and eventually made the big reveal that puts the whole series into focus while Umineko didn't do anything even remotely close to that. I've heard the games are better (more times than should be heard) but this adaptation does nothing to make me want to invest days on end into playing them and the adaptation certainly doesn't make me want to stick around for 24-26 more episodes as I care nothing about anyone in it and could care less if they all stay trapped in this game for all eternity. In fact, put Chiaki Kon and her staff in this game for all eternity with the characters. That's a suitable punishment for making this grotesque travesty of a \"murder mystery\". Seriously, all you've got is a good OST, a solid backstory with Maria and Ange (F*CK WHAT THEY DID WITH ANGE), and Beatrice's seiyuu performance. After that you have 22 eps of inane shit and characters you just want to see permanently shut up.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give Umineko no Naku Koro ni a 4 out of 10.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "In my own perspective, \"Umineko no Naku Koro ni\" is a very entertaining and enjoyable masterpiece. It's just sad that it has been quite underrated because of its comparison to Higurashi and that the Visual Novel was still a lot better. First of all, don't go thinking it would be close to Higurashi 'coz its plot is a lot different though similar. Higurashi's main point is horror while Umineko is more of a thriller or rather something like a mind battle like \"Death Note\" and even includes witches and magic. For me, this is one of the most unpredictable anime I've ever watched and doesnot deserve being underrated. It's a series that would actually even make you want to rewatch the whole series after completing it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nNow this is what you call an anime with a \"really deep\" story. Before enjoying this anime, let me tell you that the first 4 episodes were introduction only to the anime's plot. After that, episode 5 finally reveals the plot of the story so I suggest don't go dropping it before that if you think you already know the plot (well, if you really want to know the plot before you can continue, all I can say is this: Human vs Witch). Episode 6 will make you think this is getting boring, but let me tell you after watching Episode 7 you might finally like this anime. The major breakdown of the series is episode 10, as it would probably make you say \"WHAT THE HELL IS HAPPENING HERE!?\". Being unable to bear such breakdown might finally make you want to drop this anime, moreover, that the protagonist seems to have no chance (0%) in winning. However, let me tell you that the protagonist was just unprepared in those episodes and will finally show off his true might for the rest of the series. Regarding the breakdown in Episode 10, there'll be an explanation for that too. The last episode was satisfying, though you might think many of the mysteries were left unsolved, they were actually answered but in a way that you can already logically think how and just think of them yourself.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation: 6\\n\r\nThere's nothing special about the art and animation, but it's actually very good enough since I think it was given quite the budget.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nThough I've heard other anime with really good bgms, this has actually good ones. It has a very thrilling background when the protagonist shows off, and I love it. Most of the sounds were taken and remixed from the visual novel it has a good variety of sounds and all...\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\nAside from the protagonist and antagonist, all the other characters were also given spotlight to know their story and even sometimes see a cool side of them, which is a plus actually. The thing I didn't quite like was the inconsistency of Beatrice's character (the antagonist), you may think of her as one of the most evil creatures but she also sometimes makes a character of a good person and even gets a bit feeling of romance between her and Battler (protagonist). Another one with an inconsistent character would be Maria, she's cute and adorable in normal situations and you might even cry for her when you see her being abused by her mother. However, her character often changes into an annoying evil brat. My favorite character is of course Ushiromiya Battler, he's cool and funny.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the scenes in Umineko and I was very satisfied. If you enjoy a battle of wits, you'll enjoy this too. The only reason I didn't rate the enjoyment 10 but 9 was because there are also some boring scenes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nI liked it so much. It's a gem that should be appreciated more.",

            "content": "This anime needs a solid review from someone who enjoyed the visual novels and enjoyed this series. Now if you were looking for a masterpiece that was craftily made by a work of geniuses, fully-fleshed out with minor discrepancies, this anime is not for you. If you enjoy a good the-gore-is-all-over-the-place-just-to-piss-off-the-main-character kind of anime, you've found it. Let me begin my review by saying that this is not an amazing adaption, nor is it a terrible adaption, it's an adaption nonetheless and fans of Ryukishi07's other work will greatly enjoy this series. I also will be comparing the anime to VN (visual novel) quite frequently.\r\nStory:10/10\\n\r\nA very original story, but while it lacks the luster of the VN it still gets the job done. Battler, our hero, arrives on his grandfathers island after six years of absence with 17 other family members. A rumor a witch exists flies through the air that day and mysterious murders begin to occur at night. Your usual occult story? Not in the slightest. Battler encounters the witch and challenges her that he can prove that WITCHES DON'T EXIST *WHILE* playing with a *witch*. The idea is a little crazy, but it sure as hell is interesting! Battler tries to solve the witches riddles to save his family from Ryukishi07 aspect is that the story occurs numerous times, each time a different way, but unlike Higurashi, the main character is aware of what is going via a meta-world perspective. The game he plays with the witch is like that of a game of chess, in which the witch will set up her trap, and Battler will counter with a rebuttal to try and out wit the witch. Full of twists and turns, it is sure not to disappoint.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nSerious business here guys. Studio DEEN failed, but not too hard. It well... DEEN'd. The animation varies from time to time, and sometimes experiences moments of QUALITY - but not on a Kampfer level scale. The character designs are all adapted from the visual novel and fit perfectly (although the female characters bust sizes undergo extreme inflation, typical DEEN). The fight scenes are really nice, and often very exciting. For those of who've played the visual novel, watching your favorite battle scene surely won't let you down. The meta-world use of red text was applied really nicely and I was very impressed with the animators decision. The red text literally flies across the screen, because in the VN the red text is just said. A smart decision not to remove the red text (as it is very important to the story) and a smart way to use it. Some of the art was also imported from the VN, which is a really nice touch.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nHot damn. Great soundtrack, awesome opening, solid ending, sound effects and seiyuu's galore. A fair amount (more than eighty percent) of the BGM comes from the visual novel, a doujin (self-made) game that had a ton of doujin artists compose songs to accompany it. The use of the same doujin music is what makes the anime that much better. Your favorite (or soon to be)  background songs make up for the sometimes silly animation. The opening \"One-winged Angel\" by Shikata Akiko (same voice of the VN OP) is really cool with a strong mysterious almost melancholic sound throughout. The ending \"Kinzo' Madhouse of Divine Tragedy\" by JIMANG is a good kind of creepy and loud, which gives off the right vibe for this anime. A lot of the sound effects came from the visual novel (SURPRISE) and work well with the anime. Pretty much every other voice actor/actress decided to play a role in this anime, since the cast of characters is MASSIVE. Beatrice's voice is awesome, Daisuke Ono plays Battler, Yui Horie as Maria, and a ton more (go check 'em out! It's no joke that a ton of prominent voices are in this)!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nWell you wanted sniper bunnies, right? How about trendy maids that represent the seven deadly sins? Oh, Victorian dresses and fancy-pants clothes? Come on down! Battler is a musclehead (poorly adapted by DEEN into a fabulous pretty boy in animation only) who probably isn't as intelligent as the nine-year-old cousin, but he's got guts. Rivaling Kamina in manly finger pointing and bro power levels, Battler yells, hits on his cousins and laughs in the face of death. A real manly man, who fights for his parents and his family.  Beatrice is the epitome of \"troll\" in the animated universe. A bitch, a trickster, a murderer, a liar, a cheater, and everything else you can think of. You've really gotta see this chick in action to believe it. The rest of the cast is humongous, but there's a character for everyone (I think the author followed Tite Kubo with this: Not exciting enough? ADD A NEW CHARACTER), and I mean it in the best way possible. These are dynamic, interesting characters, not one-sided shallow flat designs.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nThe enjoyment is the most important factor in an anime I believe, and seeing as how I really liked the visual novel, I was very happy with this adaption.  If you were a fan of the VN, watching it get animated is really fun. Do I recommend this anime to everyone? No. This is NOT everyones slice of cake. I DO recommend the visual novel version of this to everyone though, which DOES flesh itself out (but actually game of the visual novel takes 10+ hours to play through, as oppose to the two and half the animators got to convert it). With what DEEN had, they did a pretty good job with the time alloted. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nFun to watch and interesting to talk about.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime does great with what it was given. Do I think 26 episodes was enough to fit in more than 45 hours of reading? No. I don't. I think this series would have been even better as an OVA released over time or four separate TV Series, but with the nine hours the animators had to bring this whole anime together, I think they did a wonderful job. \\n\r\nBefore or while you watch this anime, you may want to play the visual novel, but don't steer away from this anime just because I said that. The visual novel fleshes out the plot, while the anime covers the dramatic scenes and between the two, a great product is formed. If you're on the fence about this anime, give it a try; it's different and it's exciting.",

            "content": "Something has to be wrong with the author of both Higurashi and Umineko no naku koro ni, since both series are extremely twisted, violent and have some kind of sick focus on violence against kids...\r\n...BUT, at the same time this guy has quite a talent to get people hooked up to his visions of mystery and horror and that's what makes his works pretty outstanding from many other mystery anime series. Once you started the first season of Higurashi no naku koro ni you were fascinated by the tension surrounding the secrets of Watanagashi. That's exactly what happened to me watching Umineko, I was completelysucked into this world of terrifying witches and gruesome murders. \\n\\n\r\nTo make one thing clear, I never read the novel or anything, so I basically had no background information on the story or scenario. This is quite important because people call the Umineko anime a bad adaption, so for me it was possible to watch it without being influenced by the original.\\n\\n\r\n- The Story: \\n\r\nThe basic story of Umineko no naku koro ni is very complex and complicated. At first you will find yourself in some \"who-is-the-murderer\"-scenario, but pretty soon the story reveals its true face. On the one hand, this complexity of multi-layered storytelling is exciting and makes you want to dig deeper into the mystery, but on the other, due to some pretty confusing sequences, it becomes pretty difficult to follow (especially in the last arc). Sometimes you have to sit down and arrange all the information you got from the anime in your head to really see through. Since there are many characters in this anime, you cannot expect to get to know everyone in detail, but there are more than enough flashbacks of the important ones to understand their motives.\\n\\n\r\n- The Atmosphere:\\n\r\nSimilar to the first season of Higurashi no naku koro ni, there's a special atmosphere surrounding the storyline of Umineko no naku koro ni. The level of tension is high most of the time. The anime plays with people's thoughts and feelings pretty often and you will find yourself surprised and confused by sudden story-twists as well as shocked by the level of gore and violence presented. As for that part, the violence in Umineko no naku koro ni is very harsh. While you travel into the puzzling nightmare of the witches, you will witness many scenes of brutal massacre and torture along the way. \\n\\n\r\n- The Design:\\n\r\nCompared to the novel's deformed and quite bad original character designs (which I have seen at a friend's before) the design of the anime characters is more than satisfying. Of course there are some minor flaws with details such as the  exaggerated chestsize of most of the female characters older than 9 years (Yet another witch called Yoshika Miyafuji would probably like this design). All in all, the design fits the characters, Battler is a terrific protagonist while his opponents are evil and scary as hell.\\n\\n\r\n- The Final Conclusion:\\n\r\nUmineko no naku koro ni has many good elements. The story is complex, exciting and in most parts far more convincing than Higurashi's story plot. This anime's problem is the presentation of said complexity. You have to be on your guard to catch up to the plot all the time. I have to admit that I lost it in the last arc a couple of times as well, so I can understand the people who prefer the novel, which probably gives you much more time and information to understand the storydevelopment. BUT that does not decrease the fun I had watching this mystery horror anime series. \\n\r\nI even had a nightmare of the endless golden witch herself last night, so trust me when I tell you: Beatrice EXISTS, uuuh~",

            "content": "I'm writing this review without having played through any of the sound novels.\r\nI went into Umineko expecting something similar to Higurashi- inexplicably creepy behavior from otherwise trustworthy people, grisly murders, etc. What I didn't expect, though, was that Umineko would be EXTREMELY CRACKED OUT.\r\nThat was a mistake. Because I've got to say, out of all the anime I've ever seen, Umineko is one of the most cracked-out of all time. Just when you think things start to make sense, they throw in something that will make you spit your drink all over the screen. By the end of the series, it only made a modicumof sense.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 7/10. I wish I could rate the two parts of the story separately, because I enjoy one far more than the other. I didn't like the whole \"Battler tries to solve the mystery\" part at all, because I've never been a fan of whodunnit mysteries. When he's explaining the \"this person could have been in this room and killed this person, and then this other person...\" shtick, I find myself completely and utterly lost. The whole situation really reminds me of the \"Remote Island Syndrome\" plotline from The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, except ten billion times more complicated. I can't keep up with that kind of detective-style reasoning. It doesn't help that a lot of this comes many episodes after the murders themselves happen.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the other side of the story- with the various witches and Beatrice attempting to prove herself as a witch- I found extremely compelling. Maria's story was the part of this that I enjoyed the most. The reason that Beatrice had to make Battler acknowledge her was very clever, I thought. The mythology of witches in this anime is really awesome.\\n\\n\r\nSome people have said that it's stupid that Battler continues to deny witches even as he is shown proof that they exist (he is teleported, separated from his physical body, etc.) and we, the viewer, get to see actual scenes of magic being used. The explanation for this is that magic scenes in this anime are pretty much just hypothetical. We don't know whether they actually happened, or if they're just a visual illustration of what COULD have happened if magic existed.\\n\\n\r\nART: 8/10. When I was watching Higurashi, especially the first season, I was like, \"dang, Studio DEEN, you're not always that great at this.\" But as time went on, I saw that art improve. I think that by the time this series came out, the art had improved a lot. I didn't have any complaints about the art in this series, nor do I remember even a single instance of animation that looked off-form or weird. The character designs are lovely and look great, the colors are rich, and the Victorian-styled setting is beautiful. Nothing really knocked my socks off about the art, but overall, it's pretty good, at least above average.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and also, the particular videos that I got of this series were censored. They had pixelated censors over any particularly gory scene. Now, censorship scares me more than any creepy murdering witch ever could, and I have to say that the censorship here completely sucks the enjoyment out of the gore in this show. I hope some uncensored versions are released soon.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 8/10. I don't always notice sound that much in anime, but there were a couple instances where I was like, this soundtrack is pretty awesome. Some of the background music in this anime is truly great. I also love the OP and ED. The OP is just straight-up epic, very heartfelt and emotional, and it fits the anime perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nThe ED took a bit longer to warm up to, since the guy who sings it has a pretty weird-sounding voice. However, as I got used to it, I really fell in love with it. It's raw, dramatic, and scary. The one thing is that I think for horror anime, sad songs work better as EDs- they really add punch to the tragic death scenes, while this ED sounds more angry. Then again, this anime doesn't give you much time to mourn the characters that die. They're really more like pawns in the game than people to feel sorry for.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 5/10. There are a LOT of characters in this anime, and they just keep adding more and more and more as it goes along. Even from the very first episode, you're hit in the face with at least 10 different characters, and I found it very hard to remember them. At least they all have the same last name. The sad thing about this is that, since there are so very many characters, none of them really get that much time to shine. Only a few characters (such as Maria and Ange) get background stories or character development.\\n\\n\r\nWhile most of the characters seem fairly well-thought-out, there are a few that left me asking, \"Why?!?!\" The prime offenders are the Siestas, who are just completely out-of-place in this anime. They look like stereotypical villains in a sci-fi magical girl fanservice anime. With bunny ears, crazy hair colors, whiny voices, and slutty costumes, they really took away my ability to take certain scenes seriously. Their hyper-precise death blows are very scary indeed, especially when they're ruining a touching scene by killing people out of nowhere, but why couldn't they have been more like the Stakes of Purgatory?\\n\\n\r\nKanon and his laser-sword-arm also take away from the creepy gothic feel of this anime, but some of the other characters ARE really awesome. Maria reminds me of Rena from Higurashi, with her crazy pendulum swinging between cutesy little girl and psycho killer. Bernkastel and Lambdadelta (who have some connection to Rika and younger-Takano from Higurashi) didn't get nearly enough screentime to do justice to their awesome little side story, and I hope there's a second season that explores them a little more.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 7/10. A lot of the time, I was just sitting through the Beatrice/Battler deduction scenes, because I couldn't follow Battler's logic at all. The scenes I really enjoyed were the grisly murder scenes... the touching scenes between lovers, especially when they were suddenly killed right afterward... and the scenes exploring the Rosa/Maria relationship, anything with Sakutaro, Ange's past, et cetera. It was often hard for me to keep up with all the new characters being introduced, though. I had a pretty decent time watching the anime.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 8/10. I think I enjoyed the concepts behind this anime more than the show itself. A lot of the time, the pacing was too fast to keep up with, and the events happening onscreen were too ambiguous to understand. However, when I finished watching the show, I found myself sitting and thinking, appreciating the concepts of witchcraft and the struggle between the humans and witches. For that reason, I think I'm going to check out the sound novel, since it probably goes into depth about those things a lot more.\\n\\n\r\nI'm hoping for a second season that will explain what's going on and unveil the mystery of the events on Rokkenjima Island. Kind of like what Kai did for Higurashi. The ending to this series was both satisfying and unsatisfying- it felt right, but left so much more to be explained. Ultimately, I'm hoping that even someone like me, who can't grasp Battler's detective reasoning at all, will be able to comprehend Umineko.",

Only 5 eps are out finishing a story arc like Higurashi and the plot twists are amazing. I would describe it as a loose detective-like almost Pheonix Wright with gore and a psycho little girl who is absolutely adorable.\r\nStudio Deen uses colours that arn't too overpowering but help portray the environment and thecharacters personalities very well. The charcters are well drawn and the larger eyes exaggerate the strong emotions constantly appearing throughout.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack isn't as good as it could have been but its not really a big part as the intricate dialogue keeps your mind busy wondering and predicting 'her' next move.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is worth watching because there is an air of mystique about it that draws me you in wanting more and to figure out the mystery about the Witch.",

            "content": "This review is based solely on the anime.\r\nThe Umineko franchise has a huge fan-base as it\u2019s based upon a popular Japanese murder mystery game and visual novels (VNs) made by 07Expansion. Most people who played the games and read the VNs are disappointed with the way Studio Deen presented Umineko to the big screen, particularly changes in the story and animation of the characters. My rating changed constantly throughout the series and resulted in a 5. It appeared as a show incredibly unique and original in the beginning but resulted in something totally bland and deficient in the end.\r\nStory (4):\r\nUmineko has an incredible plot consistingof a philosophical war between fantasy and reality. The anime began on an intriguing note as it introduced a murder mystery, but it progressed into something far too complex for 26 episodes, leaving the story with a major cliffhanger. Numerous questions were presented throughout the series, and nearly all of them were left unanswered. The content is hard to consume as so much info is thrown at you all at once, not to mention the multiple characters. The viewer will tend to become confused with the alternate universes and misdirections. E.g. A character can appear as an undefeatable supernatural being in one universe and a defenseless human in another, affecting the mystery-solving case. Additionally, some supernatural aspects were not explained.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime revolves around a fantasy vs. reality battle. Battler, one of the murdered family members, participates in a one-on-one logic battle with the Golden Witch Beatrice. Beatrice aims to make Battler acknowledge her as a witch, and Battler fights to prove that the murders were not the result of magic by providing logical explanations behind the murders. He does this by observing him and his family get murdered repeatedly in alternate universes. This strategy makes Umineko appear unique from other mystery anime, until Battler and Beatrice turn the gameplay into something dramatic. Their drama causes several distractions when they turn away from the mystery by throwing random insults at each other and going on non-speaking terms. The drama overshadows the main point of the story: the mystery. Their immaturity causes the series to become something silly instead of serious, and the anime ends with the mystery unsolved.\\n\\n\r\nUmineko served several misdirections in its plot. The game has rules that seem helpful in solving the mystery, but some rules were not presented until late in the game. One of those rules was the \u201cred truth.\u201d Beatrice uses the red truth in the game, declaring that everything she says in red is indeed the truth. The rule was that only a witch is able to use the red truth, but Battler does the same thing later. Like the \u201cred truth,\u201d some of the rules were misused, making them appear to be null and void. It would\u2019ve been a good strategy to solve a mystery, if it was actually factual and all rules were introduced at the start of the game.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (5): \\n\\n\r\nThere are a massive amount of characters (>30 people), and they quickly increase as the anime goes from one arc to the next. The game would\u2019ve been more enjoyable if it remained with the approximate 20 characters in the first arc. Because of the various characters, the mystery becomes even harder to solve as you have to understand the reason for their presence. The introduction to some characters were used to become observers (and interferers) of Battler and Beatrice\u2019s game, and it causes the drama to worsen throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nSome of the characters appear unbearably annoying in the beginning, but character development progresses as the story unfolds. It explains the meaning behind the characters\u2019 behavior by going into their past or behind-the-scenes during the murder cases. Thankfully, it focuses on the important characters and not waste time on the less active ones.\\n\\n\r\nBeatrice and Battler are the two MCs that people tend to either hate or love. Beatrice\u2019s personality changed constantly. She goes from fulfilling her role as the evil witch with clever tricks to a good witch by showing sympathy and being emotional, and the cycle repeats itself. I eventually gave up on trying to understand her and just watched the series. \\n\\n\r\nBattler is introduced to the series as a pervert, immediately giving the viewer the wrong impression of the series. Some of his points in the argument doesn\u2019t make sense, and he appears as a wimp by sometimes becoming emotional during the game. However, he\u2019s quite the persistent being who\u2019s determined to prove the non-existence of witches and magic, despite the various supernatural beings surrounding him. \\n\\n\r\nArt (10): \\n\\n\r\nSimilar to the Higurashi series, it\u2019s basically your typical Sh\u014djo artwork with big-eyed characters. Readers of the VNs and players of the game would most likely be appalled to see their characters drawn with big eyes. I exceptionally loved the artwork and European theme. The gory scenes, especially dismantled bodies, and well-animated backgrounds were drawn to fit the horrific theme of the anime. The characters' faces were drawn perfectly according to their emotions. E.g. The terror in their eyes is enough to terrify the viewer as murders commence. Also, Beatrice's face changes along with her personality. One moment she looks innocent, and she's looks evil and terrifying the next.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9): \\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED were amazing songs, and the lyrics give teasers about the series. The lyrics of the OP describe the night of the murders itself: \u201cThe banquet of the irregular night repeats itself again and again\u201d and the game between Battler and Beatrice \u201cDestroy these captured illusions.\u201d The ED is fast-paced and scarier with the creepy dark hallways of the mansion. The lyrics describe a person\u2019s desire to encounter Beatrice: \u201cOh beloved demon, grant me a wish.\u201d Creepy organ music played in the background sometimes, boosting the suspense of the series. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters reacted appropriately to numerous situations. The witches had their whole-hearty laughs. People mourned for their loved ones, and their reactions are so realistic.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (4):\\n\r\nHonestly, this is the worst mystery anime I\u2019ve ever seen. I was excited in the beginning with the unique plot and introduction of the game, thinking that I was in for a treat. However, I was disappointed and confused, especially with the ending. It was a major cliffhanger, and I found it mostly to be a drama instead of a mystery anime. I started reading the manga where the anime left off (Umineko no Naku Koro ni Chiru - Episode 5: End of the Golden Witch), and the drama worsened so much in the first few pages that I gave up on the Umineko franchise altogether.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (5):\\n\r\nUmineko appeared as a promising anime and turned into something tedious. Fans of mystery anime may become disappointed with a misleading story and a horrible ending. There are gory and disturbing images, but the mystery becomes unsolved with the viewer most likely being confused.",

            "content": "Please note: This review will be the review of an anime-only reviewer. I will not be comparing/lamenting the adaption quality.\r\nUmineko no Naku Koro ni is a fantastic story. Taking elements of both Eastern and Western mythologies, we are thrust into a battle between witches. A battle of fantasy vs reality, where we can trust nothing we see, and are forced to reason our way out of a labyrinth of lies.\r\nThe music is strong, if not particularly noteworthy. It supports the scenes well, but one will not be humming the themes walking down the street. The OP/ED are excellent, though. By now, we know that DEENis not a fantastic animation studio. It would come as no surprise that occasionally, there are some art problems. \\n\\n\r\nA very large part of the appeal of Umineko though, are the characters. By the end of the show, you know each character and love most of them. Each member of the family receives a time to shine. This is also supported by one of the most complicated, and interesting antagonists I've seen in anime, the Golden Witch, Beatrice. \\n\\n\r\nThe other main draw is the story. The issue with this, is that one cannot discuss it without giving away large plot points. Suffice it to say, that there are layers upon layers of plans, lies, and rules, both written and unwritten.\\n\\n\r\nUmineko is going to be a tough sell to later viewers, as a large part of the charm of the series is wildly speculating the questions of who and how. Ryukishi07 is a gifted writer, and anything by him will be an interesting journey, if nothing else. Do yourself a favor and don't rush through Umineko. Umineko isn't for everyone, but those who \"get\" it, will love it.",

Even if you have zero interest in VNs (I was like that), just forget about the series, since you might someday change your mind. \r\nThe original is a masterpiece. I personally gave it a 10/10 in vndb; the story is among the best I've ever seen in any medium. The anime, on the other hand, is nothing special; you'll run into entertainment of similar value everywhere. It's barely worth 6/10.\r\nI was introduced to Umineko through the anime. I had watched (and liked) Higurashi and had never read VNs before, so the idea of doing sohere never even crossed my mind. I was amazingly lucky, though, as after the first 9 or 10 eps I decided to try the VN for no real reason (I wanted to check whether it had a certain type of gameplay - it didn't). I found the visuals ridiculous, but I soon realized that the execution of the story was far, FAR better than in the anime. Once I had gotten used to the graphics, I was hooked.\\n\\n\r\nThe tldr reason for why the anime shouldn't exist: it leaves out tons of detail and butchers the emotional content of the rest of the story with its ridiculous pace. Calling this mediocre series \"Umineko no naku koro ni\" is pure blasphemy.",

            "content": "It's been a long while since I was active in the site.\r\nUmineko is somewhat of an \"sequel\" to the fantastic Higurashi series, although with almost no link between the two except for possibly 2 characters (which I will neglect to name to prevent spoilers). In October 1986, a group of 18 people, including members of the Ushiromiya extended family and their servants, decided to hold a meeting in their island, Rokkenjima, with the purpose of discussing how the wealth of the family is to be distributed after the death of the current head, Kinzo. Unfortunately, after the arrival of the entire family, a storm trapsthe 18 people, mysteriously preventing contact with the outside world. At this same point of time, members of the 18 slowly gets murdered one by one, usually in a bizzare manner, which was credited by Maria, the youngest member on the island, to be done by the endless witch Beatrice. However, her cousin, Battler, rejected any existance of witchcraft in the world, and thus, attempts to answer all the deaths via logic, an attempt which interests Beatrice herself...\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\r\nFirst of, I've never played the game, read the novel/manga or whatsoever. Thus, my only experience of the story is via the anime. Possibly based on that alone, I thought hte story was very well structured, with the exception of the 1st 2 episodes, which were absolute messes. However, I found it puzzling at a few aspects, including the fact that various supposed main characters, like Battler's stepmother Kyrie, to have so little screen time, and how some of the story plot just doesn't flow. Nevertheless, the story as a whole is above decent, and deserves praise.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nThe characters, the background, the golden butterflies representing Beatrice all look decent, but the blood as been censored too much IMO, but it's decent enough.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nMusic is an absolute nightmare, and I do not think the opening and ending themes match the anime at all.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nNow, for the long list of criticisms. As mentioned earlier, Kyrie was neglected any real screen time, which is a big nono, since she was supposed to be hte source of Battler's \"turn over the table\" motto. Characters were supposed to be interesting, but I found most of them to be annoying. Maria's just irritating, with her over-emo/creepy combo. George is a real... eyesore, Kinzo, supposedly a ruthless powerful man, was seen constantly crying, while Shannon and Kanon have been given inconsistent personalities as the story went on to the third arc. Battler, a supposedly intelligent person with a great logical view on the situation, has been seen just moaning about how he can't think of hte solution. The creators should really have looked to their efforts on Higurashi's characters while making this.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nTHis is given a 7 only because the story keeps me on the edge enough to want to watch ti weekly, rather than to force myself to complete the series.\\n\\n\r\nAsking a player of the game would get you a bad review on the story department as well, but if you're like me, and haven't played the game, the show is watchable, but beware of creepy lolis and a league of extraordinarily bad characters.",

            "content": "I'll start off with that i have not read the visal novel. This will be a review from someone who just watched an anime adaption without knowledge to its origin. The other review scores on MAL for this anime is such a rollercoaster, you have to make a choice. Is this really worth it to watch? I enjoyed this anime more than i hated it, hence the low overall score. But there are many things about this anime that is good if you count it as \"another anime\" and not an adaption.\r\nI'll skip the intro and get to the points:\r\nStory:\r\nWhat appears to be a simplemurder mystery turns into a mind battle of lies and truth in death note style. As in higurashi, you have several scenarios. One person go crazy, kill all, then it restarts with another person etc. In umineko's case it works the same. Just that it gets more and more... crazy involvements and for each reset is a new game which needs to be solved. It's a witch vs. Man battle. Where the man will deny the existence of witches, while the witch want the man to aknowledge them. With lots of confusing back stories, flashbacks which makes you go \"What the...?\" Many times. It's confusing but there is thoughts behind it. It'll be a 7.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nI don't understand why people slay this anime for it's \"horrible\" art. I think the art is one of the more beautifull i've seen. The art in the visual novel looks alot worse in my eyes(hence a reason why i don't want to play it). Sure all the females have big breasts except the little girl but i don't complain about that. But variaton in sizes is nice. I thought the art and details to environment, clothing, characters was gorgeous! A 9 from me here.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nI think most reviewers here will agree that the soundtrack in this anime is the strongpoint of it. I simply love the soundtracks, opening and ending! The music really sets the mood and i love how they put \"cartoon\" sounds into the funny moments. It really did give it a fuzzy charm. Another 9 from me!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nI'll agree. It's quite a large cast in this anime. And only being 26 episodes not all the characters have a chance for a backstory. But everyone has their own unique reactions and decisions which makes it good. You have the annoying little girl who can turn crazy at times. The objection pointing protagonist. The tsundere witch who is also evil. There are many characters here and i liked most of them. But i just can't stand those guys who have classes and act all sexy and hero. Too bad there is one of those here. I think the characters are given just the right amount of screen time for their roles and importancy. And they all look nice! An 8 from me.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nThis is a hard one. I enjoyed this anime very much. It got a beautifull soundtrack and gorgeous art to follow! A very big cast of characters is both nice and confusing. The amount of going back in time, flashbacks, backstories can really get on a person's nerve. I think anyone who watches this will go \"WTF?\" at least once. As i am not sure where this stands i give enjoyment a 6. The amount of \"good\" enjoyment overweight the \"bad\" enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nTo end this review i'd like to remind you reader. You don't need knowledge from the visual novel or mangas to enjoy this. You will get \"WTF?\" moments and you will get mind-raped. About the ending? It was an open one for sure. And i don't know if there will be a sequel. But in return for the mind-rape you will experience a very colourfull cast of characters, beautifull soundtrack and very nice visuals!\\n\\n\r\nI recomend this if you like occult themes, blood, gore and violence, murder mystery, magic and mind battles. What will your decision be?",

I believe the setting of the novel is perfect for a mystery.Sure, it might be a blatant copy of Aghata Christie's \"Ten Little Niggers\", but having a group of people on a secluded island with mysterious murders going on always makes up for some good suspense.Plus, most characters seem to have interesting back stories.So , what went wrong? Well, this potential remains totally unexploited, since the story chooses to focus on the supernatural world, whose inhabitants are the least complex characters of the entire cast.Let's face it, demons and witches are made to represent certain human traits, so how can we really make them into fully fleshed out characters? I found myself enjoying the ( sadly too brief ) insight in the stories of Ange and Kyrie much more than the entire logic battle between Battler and Beato, the latter being way too confusing at times ( especially when the event discussed happened a couple of episodes ago and you hardly remember the details of it ).\\n\r\nIn short, the anime failed to create the deep bond between the viewer and the main characters that we had in Higurashi.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nIn general, very good.However, mouths and noses seem to disappear all too often.Also, censorship ticks me off on general principal, you either let an artist do a scene with gore , or you don't, pixelated cover-ups don't help the overall look.Can patches be released for an anime? We'll see with the dvd version, but untill then, art remains at 7/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nVery good voice acting, nice music ( very very epic OP and ED in my opinion ), what more can one  want?\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nAs stated in the story section, great cast of characters, but we don't see much of any of the interesting ones. If ( hopefully ) there's a next season, that might change ...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nIt was actually a good show.Although it was far from my expectations ( as I've said, higurashi fanboy ), it was quite enjoyable and I was constantly looking forward to my weekly golden witch fix.I do believe that I should re-watch all episodes back to back in order to fully appreciate it, since that would probably clear up a lot of confusion.So, if you're wondering if the show is worth it, give it a shot.And if you have that option DON'T read the VN beforehand:):)",

            "content": "My first review, probably won't be great.\r\nUmineko no Naku Koro ni. If you've seen it's precedes Higurashi no Naku Koro ni and Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai, then you should have about half a clue about what's going on. Umineko is similar to them, but WAY to different.\r\nDon't expect the same thing, but be prepared for alot of mind screw as the plot proceeds.\r\nStory - The story is great. I love how everything fits into place at some point. The anime is following the game's story fairly well, some things were left out, but no big deal.\r\nArt - The art, at a first look,I would rate it an 8. Very well done, but not the greatest. Once you start to watch the anime and game more, the way everything is designed fades, but still maintains a good level.\\n\\n\r\nSound - Probably my favorite part in Umineko. The sound is simply to wonder for words. Some of the BGM music was left out for certain things in the anime, but they still kept alot of important BGM's. The music is one of the reasons I've come to love this show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - All of the characters in the show are fine. Battler, the main character, I think he is being interpreted well in the anime, but he still differs from the game in a huge way. Maria is probably one of the cutest in the show, and one of the creepiest, which the anime plays horribly straight. Jessica is a great character, but the anime isn't showing her great side. They only show her as a damsel in distress, and haven't even began to show her better side, very sad. George isn't getting as much attention as he should in the anime. Like Jessica, he isn't getting his better side shown.\\n\\n\r\nThe parents, specifically Rosa and Eva, aren't getting what they should in the anime. Eva is being portrayed as a total freak in the anime, and Rosa, I bet her fan base has declined because of the anime. She was introduced as Eva x10 to me. All of the other parents are ether barely shown or don't have much known about them, including Kinzo.\\n\\n\r\nNow for Beatrice. She is only shown as some sadistic witch who only has pleasure in trying to get Battler to surrender. Her playful side isn't even shown. At some degree, her character is actually being portrayed well though, more her tsun side instead of her dere side.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - The show is about to enter Episode 4. I have to say, even though alot about the characters and some parts of the story was left out, it is a very good show. I have high hopes for the last question arc, and I know it should end well. Umineko is, certainly, a very well done anime.",

            "content": "When Seagulls Cry is an unorthodox approach to the psychological/thriller/murder genre. An interesting story reminiscent of Higu No series I find that this series carries a love/hate relationship (either you like it or you do not). What first attracted me to this series was mere coincidence and I am glad I have taken the plunge to indulge in this psychological caper. Without giving much away I'd like to introduce one of the two side s imperative to this series.\r\n[b]Fantasy[/b]\r\nYou believe in magic, witches and uuuu~ scary things that go bump in the night. this series relies on the premise that the outcomes are already decidedbut who is really behind these gruesome murders. Was there some human connection or is there really a component behind the Golden Witch. \\n\r\n[b] Anti-Fantasy[/b] \\n\r\nMagic is an illusion and while this group is a minority it is fun to speculate at the possibilities of how and (if your a Law and Order fan) who has the motive to kill all these people. A lot of critical details follow like Higu post-arc but lets say for now I have a peaked interest and a few theories to say that any side has plausible and weak arguments. \\n\\n\r\nImperatively, I find myself asking a lot of questions throughout the series that reflect the storytelling which is done in a very unique way. While one particular character stands out, Battler (who names their kid that anyway), interjects his quest to prove that no magic is involved often throws quite a few logical fallacies our way). Of course, there are contradicting elements throughout the story.\\n\r\nFor example, there is Maria the character we love to hate who sides on the fantasy realm. While she is approximately six there is something more that meets the eye with her (besides wanting to punch her in the face half the time). \\n\\n\r\nInterestingly, I hope to update this as we go along but as you have no doubt read the premise this tale hopefully lives up to your and my own expectations.",

            "content": "Umineko no Naku Koro Ni could be considered the little brother of the oh so high praised Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni. This being, the expectation were exceptionally high for this series. Many say though, that the Adaption itself was shit. I, who hasn't read the Visual to neither Higurashi nor Umineko can't tell. But what I can tell is what I got as an Anime itself. And that shall be presented here:\r\nStory: The story of Umineko is just as Higurashis really complex and seems to quite equal to it. But as soon you reach a certain episode you might realize, that it is not!\r\nThestory takes place on an island called Rokkenjima. One day the head of the rich Ushiromiya family, Ushiromiya Kinzo, invites all his children and grandchildren to come to his island. Here the actual story is going to get started. After a bit of talk and backgroundknowledge, some people get brutally murdered. Soon it turns out, that those shouldn't stay the only ones getting killed. One after another the whole supporting and even the main cast gets wiped out. The end? No. Not even close. As you might have guessed the whole thing works the same way as Higurashi does and different archs continue this slaughter in different ways.\\n\r\nThe whole story has a heck of a lot of twists but it sometimes fails in keeping you concentrated and you might get a bit confused about how everything worked out this way.\\n\r\n8\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The whole character list for this Anime is far too long to list everyone here, so I'll just name the few that get the most screentime, which are Ushiromiya Battler, who is the one that has to solve the whole riddle. He is more of a fighting style character, but does lose his confidence sometimes, which makes him a bit more human.\\n\r\nThe next one is the golden eternal witch Beatrice, which is a cruel witch, that kills everyone for the sake of her revival. She is the opponent of Battler and is our typical psycho-antagonist.\\n\r\nThe supporting cast is as I said earlier really big, with it holding every single bit of the Ushiromiya Family and their servants. They are giving a lot of careful attention to them though, explaining a whole lot of background, which makes everything much more deep.\\n\r\n8\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art isn't really a master piece. It is well done for it's time but by now quite aged. The character design, does look good if you compare it to the original one (which I saw on some pics). I mean...seriously the original one was crap.\\n\r\n6\\n\\n\r\nSound: The Sound of Umineko does always fits well to the tone the Anime does currently have, but never is somewhat memorable. I found myself listening and singing with the Opening many times though. Espacially the ending always made me hyped for the next  episode. The Opening just fit really well to the whole show (even though I liked Higurashi's more at this point)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: If Umineko no Naku Koro Ni lacks one thing it is continuity. There are many points, that just make you go \"wtf? What just happened?\" If you aren't prepared for some oddly placed Shounen scenes and some random fanservice (it is not much though), that sometimes don't really fit the show's theme, than you will be really surprised by this (at least I was). There were points in the show where I almost sopped watching during an episode due to boredom.\\n\r\nOn the other hand, there were also parts, that hooked me so much, that I actually jumped out of my seat (I mean...literally). Combined with the ending that effect was even better.\\n\r\n7\\n\\n\r\nSummary: In total, the whole plot of Umineko is really interesting. It has a good idea, has a lot of good characters and a heck of a fanbase loving the VN. But as we know DEEN, they like to disappoint us whenever we are expecting the highest. They had many points, were they executed it brilliantly but also many points, were they did it just as poorly. It got me hooked and it got me bored. So I give it in total a 7/10",

            "content": "A few things before reading this review:\r\n\t-yes, I am one of those who have played the sound novel before watching the anime;\r\n\t-no, I will not make this an essay of comparison between the two, nor will I praise the novel over the anime; however, it is inevitable that certain comparisons will indeed appear, in order to explain the flaws of the anime;\r\n\t-this review might seem a bit unfriendly to someone who has no clue what Umineko is about. In fact, it's much more addressed to those who have partially or completely watched the anime/read the manga/played the game.\r\n\tLet me begin with a simple assertion. Uminekoas an anime is a bad experience. Note that I did not say horrendous nor terrible. The Umineko anime is not at all a complete train-wreck, despite all the hatred it receives from the fandom; it's simply nothing more than mediocre. In other terms, it feels similar to trying to bend a very detailed paper figurine in a jar that's too small and ruining it in the process. Yes, the figurine was remarkable beforehand. But no, it did not remain so afterward.\\n\r\n\tThere are two main reasons why the Umineko anime doesn't work:\\n\r\n\t-adaptation decay (butchering of the characters and the plot for time's convenience) and\\n\r\n\t-the very little effort Studio DEEN put into making it (bad graphics, right music at the wrong time, wrong character designs, overall wrong atmosphere).\\n\\n\r\n\tBUTCHERING OF THE CHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\n\tOne of Umineko's main put-offs is the fact that is has such a large cast of characters. You cannot help but forget who is who, who is related to whom, where someone popped out of, what the purpose of a certain character is and so on and so forth. The adaptation from the novel to the anime meant losing a lot of development for plot's sake, and that really adds to the overall confusion. Except for the very main two characters (Battler and Beatrice), almost all the other characters are uni-dimensional. Name one word that relates to Rosa - abusive. One that defines Maria? Whiny. One for Ronove? Cookies. See the point?\\n\r\n\tWhile it becomes (or should become) clear after a while that in the wit game of Umineko, the humans are nothing more that chess pieces and the witches are simply devices to advance the arguments, that isn't an excuse. Why should you watch something where you don't care for any of the characters? Again, this is still the adaptation's fault. The original source material, while still keeping a few members of the cast undeveloped (I'm looking at you, Hideyoshi and Nanjo), at least managed to make all the characters likeable \u2013 therefore less likely to suspect. The anime didn't retain that; quite the opposite. You end up feeling exasperated most of the time by almost everybody. \\n\r\n\tNow onto the main characters: Battler and Beatrice.\\n\\n\r\nBattler: \\n\r\n\t-supposed to be the epitome of manliness, logic and determination [novel];\\n\r\n\t-ended up being the most delusional of them all (ironically), has huge shoujo eyes and most of the times doesn't make any sense at all [anime].\\n\\n\r\nBeatrice: \\n\r\n\t-complex character, acts all cruel, rough and unrefined in the beginning, but manages to melt halfway through and create a friendship/rivalry bond with Battler, to the point of finally being able to transmit to him the purpose of her existence [novel];\\n\r\n\t-complete bitch who takes a 180 turn in the last episode and goes all helpless moe moe kyun for no reason [anime].\\n\\n\r\n\tBUTCHERING OF THE PLOT\\n\\n\r\n\tLike it or not, the original Umineko story is damn complex, a complete, subtle mindfuck, in fact. Perhaps that is why it doesn't work that well in the visual format of the anime. Anime watchers are used to taking something literally as it is. Umineko was not supposed to be like that \u2013 hence even the unfriendly red text. Unfortunately, Studio DEEN didn't manage to clear the misconception at all. To get to the point:\\n\r\n\tOne of the main questions that arose while experiencing Umineko (both in the sound novel and the anime form) was this \u2013 why the heck would Battler try to deny the existence of the witch when she's obviously sitting in front of him, cackling inelegantly and hitting him in the head with her pipe? It seems utterly ridiculous and pointless. A complete waste of time.\\n\r\n\tHowever, that is not the case. The novel, having the advantage of underlining concepts in a textual form, managed to clear this. The anime didn't. To explain further on:\\n\\n\r\n\tSay Mary (Beatrice) is a multimillionaire and Ben (Battler) is a salary-man. There is a great business plan (the murders) going to unfold. Ben claims that you can manage that business with an amount of experience similar to the one he has (logic). Mary claims that you can only do it with a lot of money (magic). They decide to settle this in a game of monopoly (the anti-fantasy vs. anti-mystery game). \\n\r\n\tNow obviously, in a game of monopoly there are restrictions. You can only play with monopoly money. Had Mary played with real-life money, Ben would have absolutely no chance of winning. That's why, Mary's moves are restricted as well. It's a completely fair game.\\n\r\n\tProving the point, basically Battler doesn't have to deny magic, period. He would never be able to do that, with Beatrice appearing in front of him and whatnot. He has to deny magic on the 4th and 5th of October 1986 in Rokkenjima, based on the fake scenarios created by Beatrice. It's logical, it's fair and with the right ideas, it doesn't contradict itself at all, quite the opposite. That is the whole fun and magic of Umineko.\\n\\n\r\n\tOf course, some might say, how the heck were the viewers supposed to know this with the anime not explaining it? Unfortunately, by the explanations being cut, they simply could not know it. The novel had a lot of detailed sidelong concepts to help the whole logic battle (chessboard turning, Hempel's raven, Schr\u00f6dinger's cat box) which the anime only briefly mentioned and never insisted on. In other words, a mystery which seemed barely solvable in the novel isn't solvable at all in the anime. That's why, if you're watching Umineko expecting to get a straightforward, definite answer, you won't get it. Which is sad, considering that the main purpose of Umineko was to make you have a brainstorming session. Besides, when in an anime you have to consult additional sources to realize what the heck is going on, that in itself is a problem. I'd say watch Umineko for some other aspects than the mystery, but honestly, there's nothing more to watch if for. And that is Studio DEEN's fault.\\n\\n\r\n\tEXCESSIVE FANSERVICE, COMPLETELY UNRELATED HIGURASHI ATMOSPHERE, UNSYMMETRYCAL EARS: I'm looking at you, Studio DEEN\\n\\n\r\n\tThat's exactly as the title says. You could feel that the staff members of Studio DEEN were completely desperate by simply throwing a glance at the DVD covers. Or by the excessive amount of cleavage in all the female character designs (minus Bernkastel, who, funnily enough, did have quite the bust in the original material). It's very likely that DEEN themselves realized the Umineko anime was bad as it is; and that they had no other plans in which to compensate that.\\n\r\n\tNow I don't have anything against this particular studio; but you as a viewer could definitely sense that they screwed up. There is a famous screenshot in which Eva has a huge ear on one side of her head as opposed to the tiny one on the other side. That goes beyond the excuse of lack of funds. It's simply not caring for. The other main mistake is probably the fact that DEEN tried to promote this as a Higurashi sequel as much as they could to be able to milk money out of the fans. Why should Maria have the Hinamizawa syndrome eyes? They are irrelevant and out of place. Why must there be those weird sideways camera angles? And that emphasis on the gruesome death scenes instead of, say, the reactions of the living (much more important to the plot themselves)?\\n\r\n\tAs for the art, while not being overly-pretentious, it manages to be above barely watchable. In fact, it's a nice change from the shiny shiny artwork nowadays. Still, it doesn't rise above the overall mediocrity of the execution itself.\\n\\n\r\n\tLet's stop this lament at once, though. For Umineko also has certain redeeming characteristics, though not enough. To name them:\\n\r\n\t-the music. Yes, used mostly inconsistently, but taken as a whole, very good music. However, that is still thanks to the sound novel tracks remixes;\\n\r\n\t-OH! DESIRE. A perfect ED theme. Almost as if it was the studio's message of 'You want to get trolled? Well get trolled till the end, then!';\\n\r\n\t-OP theme;\\n\r\n\t-good, fitting voices for the characters (surprisingly, Shannon's voice actress managed to suit her personality really well).\\n\\n\r\n\tENJOYMENT AND OVERALL\\n\\n\r\n\tUmineko anime can basically be defined as a great story with a horrible execution. And that is not right; for, on an anime market with a lot of mediocre stories with great  visual/audio/atmosphere candies, Umineko is exactly the opposite, being hard to digest. \\n\r\n\tFor a sound novel player, it's a complete session of rage, of 'Why the heck was that cut?' and 'Hey, they did that wrong! Bastards!'.\\n\r\n\tAnd for an anime-only viewer, it's a 'How do I make head or tail of this thing? Eh, never mind, someone's been killed again' reaction chain.\\n\\n\r\n\tTo conclude with, I would recommend Umineko the anime only to those who are new to anime in general and have only watched around 20-30 series so far. More experimented watchers would definitely be able to sense the plot holes and lack of affective implication. And they will not enjoy that.\\n\r\n\t(As a small parenthesis, this is quite opposed to my recommendation of the novel/manga; I recommend the novel/manga to absolutely anyone. Read it and you won't regret it.)",

            "content": "One must remember that the Umineko no Naku Koro ni anime is an adaptation. While the anime in itself may not necessarily warrant harsh scores of 2 or 3, in comparison to its source material, it is extremely, extremely lacking. I find it inconceivable that anyone could give this series, even if they never read the sound novel, a 9 or 10 out of 10 rating. While the sound novel may not have been a masterpiece, it was intriguing, exciting, and, at times, moving. In its adaptation into an anime, the entire thing was turned into something disgustingly shallow and one-dimensional. \r\nI doubt that anystudio or director would have been able to cram every single detail of the sound novels into 26 episodes. However, the way it was done was nothing but uncouth. \\n\\n\r\nI was looking forward to Umineko from the moment I heard of it. I wasn't a big fan of Higurashi, but the synopsis made it seem reminiscent of my favorite book, And Then There Were None, and more fitting to my tastes in general. After the first five episodes, I couldn't describe it in any way other than \"shallow.\" I hadn't heard of or read the novels at the time, but from the very beginning it felt as though something was missing. I heard the novel really was amazing, though, and sought it out. While there were flaws, the first four episodes of the novel felt much more complete than the anime. The story is mostly reading and the atmosphere is set more by the music rather than the visuals. Despite this, R07 managed to make the experience very enjoyable. After finishing it, I then continued with the anime, hoping it would at least somewhat meet the level the sound novel did. Of course, it didn't come close. \\n\r\nThe anime really has no continuity or flow whatsoever. I found myself asking as the episodes progressed, \"Wait, did they cover event X?\" and holes simply cannot be left in a mystery story (what Umineko is presented as), other than intentional ones. Small things, such as Battler and Beatrice's reactions to each others' actions were left out or glossed over, making the story incredibly superficial. A lot of fun from the sound novel came from these moments between them.\\n\r\nThe meaning behind events happening and secrets slowly unfolding is completely lost. In fact, the fight between Battler and Beatrice, anti-fantasy vs. anti-mystery, might as well not exist in the anime. It's supposed to be a detective/mystery story, albeit a strange one, and not simply that of a fickle witch murdering over a dozen people for fun, which is what the anime turned it into, at least until the very end where it does a rapid, poorly timed 180. Of course, the end was the \"same\" in the sound novel, but then it was clearly thought out and planned. The anime made it seem as if the producers/director forgot all about the end until the last five minutes of the final episode, then shoved it in. \\n\r\nBy the end of the fourth game, one should be able to determine the culprit. By reading the sound novel, I believe this to be possible. I don't see how it could ever be done watching the anime alone.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is something that is clearly hit-or-miss. The main reason people seem to be put off from the sound novel is the \"horrendous\" art. Yes, different heads put on the same body and then turned into different characters. Yes, boxing glove hands. The art of Ryukishi07's works is clearly all about the faces. Whether the art of the anime is better or worse is something I'll let you decide for yourself. However, I think it's unquestionable that the facial expressions of the sound novel are exponentially better than the anime. I won't say that they are drawn well, but something has to be said of bad art that can manage to send chills down spines and make someone not want to read it at night because of frightening expressions. It would be hard for any animator to capture the riveting expressions of the sound novel, however I think they definitely could have tried harder, or at least have done a wider variation. \\n\r\nOf course, the faces weren't the only things animated. Some characters (Rosa) clearly look better than others (Battler), however no one looked totally dreadful, though some people would beg to disagree with that point. In some cases I actually found myself preferring it (Maria actually looks like a nine-year old), but I can't understand why they felt the need change nearly everyone's eye color to blue.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was the most decent thing. The sound of the sound novel was excellent, as to be expected. The music really makes the setting, and even some scenes. The anime remixed some of the songs and used some of the original sound effects. Some fan-favorite songs were left out, but overall they did a decent job in this department.\\n\r\nThe song for the opening was very good; I was happy to see they used Akiko Shikata, who did the opening for the sound novel. While, other than \"yami o kirisaku OH DESIIIIRE,\" I disliked the ending song itself. I found it very fitting for Kinzo, however.\\n\\n\r\nWhile many characters aren't expanded on in the sound novel until Episode 5 and the anime goes up to Episode 4, the anime made it seem as if no one, aside from Battler and Maria, had a personality. Several scenes left out of the anime expand on many of the characters, mainly the adults. Every adult in the anime, aside from Rosa, the cruel, heartless, \"mother of the year,\" might as well have been there to simply add to the body count. For instance, a scene completely left out of the fourth game in the anime, known as the \"Krauss Counter,\" made Krauss (the only adult I actually disliked at the time) likable. While the scene itself was probably the most over-the-top out of them all and not vital to the story (though it actually was part of the group held underground escaping), it made it harder to be suspicious of Krauss, who seemed to care about money more than anything else beforehand. Several scenes that were included were done very poorly, such as Rosa and Maria at the end of the second game and the Sisters of Purgatory, Kyrie, and Rudolf fighting in the third game. It was these many moments centered around the adults that actually made them seem like people rather than warm bodies existing for the sole purpose of dying.\\n\r\nThe characterization is so important to the series. A mystery has three parts to answer: the whodunnit, the howdunnit, and the whydunnit. In this series, its easiest to focus on the whydunnit, as opposed to many other mysteries.\\n\r\nBeatrice says that witches exist and that everyone is being killed by magic. Battler refuses to believe in the existence of witches and magic but can't deny that the murders are happening. If it's not magic, then one of the eighteen has to be the killer. One of the reasons the sound novel is so compelling is that every one of the possible culprits is likable in some way. As the it progresses, you don't want to believe it's any of them, but you know someone has to be guilty. Watching the anime alone, I wouldn't mind suspecting nearly anyone; I'd have no attachment to any of the characters, and therefore the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe saddest thing about this series is that it ruined what is an, if not great, at least enjoyable, story. Those who hated it are missing out on a story they could have gotten to really like. Those who loved it should definitely start reading the sound novel, if anything to read Umineko no Naku Koro ni Chiru, which will probably/hopefully never see an anime adaption.",

            "content": "So here I finally am, the bad guy who is gonna compare the anime of \"Umineko no Naku Koro ni\" against the visual novel.\r\nI was happily waiting for the release of the anime, since I really liked the first four novels. While I wasn\u00b4t expecting TOO much of the story of chapter 1, chapter 2 has underlined my bad feelings......\r\nSTORY:\r\nOverall, they followed the story well. Some keyfacts where sadly left out, like some explanations from Beatrice. Still, nothing too important was left out, but of course, MANY other funny or interesting things are missing; but in the end, you can\u00b4t push a whole book ornovel in a 24 - 26 episode anime.\\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\r\nWhen I saw the first pictures I thought \"OMG WHAT\u00b4S THAT?\", but after seeing it in action, it\u00b4s not so bad as I thought. Still, it can\u00b4t underline some characters like Eva and Beatrice very well, but I say more about that later.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nI always like it when good music from a visual novel is used in the anime again. in Umineko, the recycled old music well and used many new tracks, too. Most of the time, the music is underlining the situation perfectly; but in chapter 1, it started to annoy me that 3 episodes ended with the same track in a row...\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\r\nAnd here we are, at the biggest weakness of this anime.\\n\r\nWhile the parents like Rudolph, Rosa and Eva where intruduced as very nice people in the start of the novel (what changed not so much later), here we got to see only their ugly sides from the start.\\n\\n\r\nEvas \"lovely\" side was completely ignored, making her look like a b**** from the very start until now. Kyrie was nearly completely left out of the picture, even though she already played a good part in chapter 1 and 2, even though she may be the most interesting character out of the parents. The grand personality of Kinzo is nowhere to be seen, you see him crying most of the time. Maria\u00b4s creepyness is so exaggerated that it hurts. Jessica is only presented as a lovesick girl, but not the strong girl she really is.\\n\\n\r\nAbout Battler, he\u00b4s not half as fun as he used to be in the novel, since he\u00b4s reduced to to the tragic hero that has to oppose the witch, even though in the original it wasn\u00b4t like that.\\n\\n\r\nBut the REAL annoyance is about Beatrice.\\n\r\nHer funny, easy to tease character is completely left out, showing only the \"evil witch side\" of her, but not the interesting character she really is. The somewhat \"friendly rivalship\" between her and Battler is completely left out, as well as the fact that Battler calls her \"Beato\" since near the start of chapter 2l.\\n\\n\r\nPartly, the art-style may be at fault as well, I have trouble imagening a sulking or happily laughing Beatrice with the mostly \"serious\" style.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\r\nWhen you ignore that it is an anime to an existing story, it\u00b4s not bad, and I will still continue to watch it, since the really interesting stories are gonna start now.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nEven with the left out things of the story, it would be a great anime, if they only didn\u00b4t screw up the personalities of the characters so bad. Because they did, the story isn\u00b4t what it could be, especially because the relationship between Beatrice and Battler is totally different.\\n\\n\r\nLike that, many potential was thrown away, what makes me quite sad. It might be a good anime in it\u00b4s own way, and I still have hope for the second half, but it is not the \"Umineko no Naku Koro ni\" it should have been.",

            "content": "This is the story of a young creator named Ryukishi07 whose hit visual novel series Higurashi no Naku Koro ni became a hit anime and put him in the spotlight for great things. Hoping to capitalize on Higurashi's success, the same director and studio went to work adapting his spinoff visual novel series, Umineko no Naku Koro ni. Surely we could expect great things would come of it.\r\nWe were dead f*cking wrong.\r\nThis is anime at its most disgustingly deceptive, dragging you through 26 episodes of \"mystery\" and I cannot stress those quotation marks enough because half the time the mystery doesn't even exist. Hell Icould hardly tell what was the meta-world, the real world, the alternative world, THERE IS NO PERSPECTIVE! None! I don't even know where I am half the f*cking time so how the hell would I be expected to know what's going on?!\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are a mess. We're rivaling Geass and Nanoha levels here in characters, and as such signifies, half of them have no personalities. Hell, you see them all die so many times over and over again that you just come to accept that's their purpose in all of this. In fact, there are some characters so f*cking annoying you cheer when its their turn to take the grotesque spill, but it's not even half as enjoyable as it could be because this anime is spammed with so much violence that it makes it seem uninteresting. I have never seen senseless violence become so BORING!\\n\\n\r\nThe art is laughable. Studio Deen has clearly learned nothing from Higurashi, kept the same production values and amped up the facial distortions to a saturation point that makes them entirely unremarkable. Fortunately they kept the original music of the games which is quite good in some case if you can hear it over blood splattering and insane laughter. Oh, and another rare prop to this series for Sayaka Oohara's performance. I wonder if she got drunk before coming in on days to voice Umineko. I hope so. She at least made it halfway entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nBut the real kicker is we aren't even close to solving any of the mysteries by the end of this and it ends with WAIT FOR SEASON 2 LOL. Now some of you may say \"Hey Splitter! You gave Higurashi's first season a 9 and it did the same thing!\" Yes it did, but it also got closer to the truth every episode and eventually made the big reveal that puts the whole series into focus while Umineko didn't do anything even remotely close to that. I've heard the games are better (more times than should be heard) but this adaptation does nothing to make me want to invest days on end into playing them and the adaptation certainly doesn't make me want to stick around for 24-26 more episodes as I care nothing about anyone in it and could care less if they all stay trapped in this game for all eternity. In fact, put Chiaki Kon and her staff in this game for all eternity with the characters. That's a suitable punishment for making this grotesque travesty of a \"murder mystery\". Seriously, all you've got is a good OST, a solid backstory with Maria and Ange (F*CK WHAT THEY DID WITH ANGE), and Beatrice's seiyuu performance. After that you have 22 eps of inane shit and characters you just want to see permanently shut up.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give Umineko no Naku Koro ni a 4 out of 10.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "In my own perspective, \"Umineko no Naku Koro ni\" is a very entertaining and enjoyable masterpiece. It's just sad that it has been quite underrated because of its comparison to Higurashi and that the Visual Novel was still a lot better. First of all, don't go thinking it would be close to Higurashi 'coz its plot is a lot different though similar. Higurashi's main point is horror while Umineko is more of a thriller or rather something like a mind battle like \"Death Note\" and even includes witches and magic. For me, this is one of the most unpredictable anime I've ever watched and doesnot deserve being underrated. It's a series that would actually even make you want to rewatch the whole series after completing it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nNow this is what you call an anime with a \"really deep\" story. Before enjoying this anime, let me tell you that the first 4 episodes were introduction only to the anime's plot. After that, episode 5 finally reveals the plot of the story so I suggest don't go dropping it before that if you think you already know the plot (well, if you really want to know the plot before you can continue, all I can say is this: Human vs Witch). Episode 6 will make you think this is getting boring, but let me tell you after watching Episode 7 you might finally like this anime. The major breakdown of the series is episode 10, as it would probably make you say \"WHAT THE HELL IS HAPPENING HERE!?\". Being unable to bear such breakdown might finally make you want to drop this anime, moreover, that the protagonist seems to have no chance (0%) in winning. However, let me tell you that the protagonist was just unprepared in those episodes and will finally show off his true might for the rest of the series. Regarding the breakdown in Episode 10, there'll be an explanation for that too. The last episode was satisfying, though you might think many of the mysteries were left unsolved, they were actually answered but in a way that you can already logically think how and just think of them yourself.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation: 6\\n\r\nThere's nothing special about the art and animation, but it's actually very good enough since I think it was given quite the budget.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nThough I've heard other anime with really good bgms, this has actually good ones. It has a very thrilling background when the protagonist shows off, and I love it. Most of the sounds were taken and remixed from the visual novel it has a good variety of sounds and all...\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\nAside from the protagonist and antagonist, all the other characters were also given spotlight to know their story and even sometimes see a cool side of them, which is a plus actually. The thing I didn't quite like was the inconsistency of Beatrice's character (the antagonist), you may think of her as one of the most evil creatures but she also sometimes makes a character of a good person and even gets a bit feeling of romance between her and Battler (protagonist). Another one with an inconsistent character would be Maria, she's cute and adorable in normal situations and you might even cry for her when you see her being abused by her mother. However, her character often changes into an annoying evil brat. My favorite character is of course Ushiromiya Battler, he's cool and funny.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the scenes in Umineko and I was very satisfied. If you enjoy a battle of wits, you'll enjoy this too. The only reason I didn't rate the enjoyment 10 but 9 was because there are also some boring scenes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nI liked it so much. It's a gem that should be appreciated more.",

            "content": "This anime needs a solid review from someone who enjoyed the visual novels and enjoyed this series. Now if you were looking for a masterpiece that was craftily made by a work of geniuses, fully-fleshed out with minor discrepancies, this anime is not for you. If you enjoy a good the-gore-is-all-over-the-place-just-to-piss-off-the-main-character kind of anime, you've found it. Let me begin my review by saying that this is not an amazing adaption, nor is it a terrible adaption, it's an adaption nonetheless and fans of Ryukishi07's other work will greatly enjoy this series. I also will be comparing the anime to VN (visual novel) quite frequently.\r\nStory:10/10\\n\r\nA very original story, but while it lacks the luster of the VN it still gets the job done. Battler, our hero, arrives on his grandfathers island after six years of absence with 17 other family members. A rumor a witch exists flies through the air that day and mysterious murders begin to occur at night. Your usual occult story? Not in the slightest. Battler encounters the witch and challenges her that he can prove that WITCHES DON'T EXIST *WHILE* playing with a *witch*. The idea is a little crazy, but it sure as hell is interesting! Battler tries to solve the witches riddles to save his family from Ryukishi07 aspect is that the story occurs numerous times, each time a different way, but unlike Higurashi, the main character is aware of what is going via a meta-world perspective. The game he plays with the witch is like that of a game of chess, in which the witch will set up her trap, and Battler will counter with a rebuttal to try and out wit the witch. Full of twists and turns, it is sure not to disappoint.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nSerious business here guys. Studio DEEN failed, but not too hard. It well... DEEN'd. The animation varies from time to time, and sometimes experiences moments of QUALITY - but not on a Kampfer level scale. The character designs are all adapted from the visual novel and fit perfectly (although the female characters bust sizes undergo extreme inflation, typical DEEN). The fight scenes are really nice, and often very exciting. For those of who've played the visual novel, watching your favorite battle scene surely won't let you down. The meta-world use of red text was applied really nicely and I was very impressed with the animators decision. The red text literally flies across the screen, because in the VN the red text is just said. A smart decision not to remove the red text (as it is very important to the story) and a smart way to use it. Some of the art was also imported from the VN, which is a really nice touch.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nHot damn. Great soundtrack, awesome opening, solid ending, sound effects and seiyuu's galore. A fair amount (more than eighty percent) of the BGM comes from the visual novel, a doujin (self-made) game that had a ton of doujin artists compose songs to accompany it. The use of the same doujin music is what makes the anime that much better. Your favorite (or soon to be)  background songs make up for the sometimes silly animation. The opening \"One-winged Angel\" by Shikata Akiko (same voice of the VN OP) is really cool with a strong mysterious almost melancholic sound throughout. The ending \"Kinzo' Madhouse of Divine Tragedy\" by JIMANG is a good kind of creepy and loud, which gives off the right vibe for this anime. A lot of the sound effects came from the visual novel (SURPRISE) and work well with the anime. Pretty much every other voice actor/actress decided to play a role in this anime, since the cast of characters is MASSIVE. Beatrice's voice is awesome, Daisuke Ono plays Battler, Yui Horie as Maria, and a ton more (go check 'em out! It's no joke that a ton of prominent voices are in this)!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nWell you wanted sniper bunnies, right? How about trendy maids that represent the seven deadly sins? Oh, Victorian dresses and fancy-pants clothes? Come on down! Battler is a musclehead (poorly adapted by DEEN into a fabulous pretty boy in animation only) who probably isn't as intelligent as the nine-year-old cousin, but he's got guts. Rivaling Kamina in manly finger pointing and bro power levels, Battler yells, hits on his cousins and laughs in the face of death. A real manly man, who fights for his parents and his family.  Beatrice is the epitome of \"troll\" in the animated universe. A bitch, a trickster, a murderer, a liar, a cheater, and everything else you can think of. You've really gotta see this chick in action to believe it. The rest of the cast is humongous, but there's a character for everyone (I think the author followed Tite Kubo with this: Not exciting enough? ADD A NEW CHARACTER), and I mean it in the best way possible. These are dynamic, interesting characters, not one-sided shallow flat designs.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nThe enjoyment is the most important factor in an anime I believe, and seeing as how I really liked the visual novel, I was very happy with this adaption.  If you were a fan of the VN, watching it get animated is really fun. Do I recommend this anime to everyone? No. This is NOT everyones slice of cake. I DO recommend the visual novel version of this to everyone though, which DOES flesh itself out (but actually game of the visual novel takes 10+ hours to play through, as oppose to the two and half the animators got to convert it). With what DEEN had, they did a pretty good job with the time alloted. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nFun to watch and interesting to talk about.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime does great with what it was given. Do I think 26 episodes was enough to fit in more than 45 hours of reading? No. I don't. I think this series would have been even better as an OVA released over time or four separate TV Series, but with the nine hours the animators had to bring this whole anime together, I think they did a wonderful job. \\n\r\nBefore or while you watch this anime, you may want to play the visual novel, but don't steer away from this anime just because I said that. The visual novel fleshes out the plot, while the anime covers the dramatic scenes and between the two, a great product is formed. If you're on the fence about this anime, give it a try; it's different and it's exciting.",

            "content": "Something has to be wrong with the author of both Higurashi and Umineko no naku koro ni, since both series are extremely twisted, violent and have some kind of sick focus on violence against kids...\r\n...BUT, at the same time this guy has quite a talent to get people hooked up to his visions of mystery and horror and that's what makes his works pretty outstanding from many other mystery anime series. Once you started the first season of Higurashi no naku koro ni you were fascinated by the tension surrounding the secrets of Watanagashi. That's exactly what happened to me watching Umineko, I was completelysucked into this world of terrifying witches and gruesome murders. \\n\\n\r\nTo make one thing clear, I never read the novel or anything, so I basically had no background information on the story or scenario. This is quite important because people call the Umineko anime a bad adaption, so for me it was possible to watch it without being influenced by the original.\\n\\n\r\n- The Story: \\n\r\nThe basic story of Umineko no naku koro ni is very complex and complicated. At first you will find yourself in some \"who-is-the-murderer\"-scenario, but pretty soon the story reveals its true face. On the one hand, this complexity of multi-layered storytelling is exciting and makes you want to dig deeper into the mystery, but on the other, due to some pretty confusing sequences, it becomes pretty difficult to follow (especially in the last arc). Sometimes you have to sit down and arrange all the information you got from the anime in your head to really see through. Since there are many characters in this anime, you cannot expect to get to know everyone in detail, but there are more than enough flashbacks of the important ones to understand their motives.\\n\\n\r\n- The Atmosphere:\\n\r\nSimilar to the first season of Higurashi no naku koro ni, there's a special atmosphere surrounding the storyline of Umineko no naku koro ni. The level of tension is high most of the time. The anime plays with people's thoughts and feelings pretty often and you will find yourself surprised and confused by sudden story-twists as well as shocked by the level of gore and violence presented. As for that part, the violence in Umineko no naku koro ni is very harsh. While you travel into the puzzling nightmare of the witches, you will witness many scenes of brutal massacre and torture along the way. \\n\\n\r\n- The Design:\\n\r\nCompared to the novel's deformed and quite bad original character designs (which I have seen at a friend's before) the design of the anime characters is more than satisfying. Of course there are some minor flaws with details such as the  exaggerated chestsize of most of the female characters older than 9 years (Yet another witch called Yoshika Miyafuji would probably like this design). All in all, the design fits the characters, Battler is a terrific protagonist while his opponents are evil and scary as hell.\\n\\n\r\n- The Final Conclusion:\\n\r\nUmineko no naku koro ni has many good elements. The story is complex, exciting and in most parts far more convincing than Higurashi's story plot. This anime's problem is the presentation of said complexity. You have to be on your guard to catch up to the plot all the time. I have to admit that I lost it in the last arc a couple of times as well, so I can understand the people who prefer the novel, which probably gives you much more time and information to understand the storydevelopment. BUT that does not decrease the fun I had watching this mystery horror anime series. \\n\r\nI even had a nightmare of the endless golden witch herself last night, so trust me when I tell you: Beatrice EXISTS, uuuh~",

            "content": "I'm writing this review without having played through any of the sound novels.\r\nI went into Umineko expecting something similar to Higurashi- inexplicably creepy behavior from otherwise trustworthy people, grisly murders, etc. What I didn't expect, though, was that Umineko would be EXTREMELY CRACKED OUT.\r\nThat was a mistake. Because I've got to say, out of all the anime I've ever seen, Umineko is one of the most cracked-out of all time. Just when you think things start to make sense, they throw in something that will make you spit your drink all over the screen. By the end of the series, it only made a modicumof sense.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 7/10. I wish I could rate the two parts of the story separately, because I enjoy one far more than the other. I didn't like the whole \"Battler tries to solve the mystery\" part at all, because I've never been a fan of whodunnit mysteries. When he's explaining the \"this person could have been in this room and killed this person, and then this other person...\" shtick, I find myself completely and utterly lost. The whole situation really reminds me of the \"Remote Island Syndrome\" plotline from The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, except ten billion times more complicated. I can't keep up with that kind of detective-style reasoning. It doesn't help that a lot of this comes many episodes after the murders themselves happen.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the other side of the story- with the various witches and Beatrice attempting to prove herself as a witch- I found extremely compelling. Maria's story was the part of this that I enjoyed the most. The reason that Beatrice had to make Battler acknowledge her was very clever, I thought. The mythology of witches in this anime is really awesome.\\n\\n\r\nSome people have said that it's stupid that Battler continues to deny witches even as he is shown proof that they exist (he is teleported, separated from his physical body, etc.) and we, the viewer, get to see actual scenes of magic being used. The explanation for this is that magic scenes in this anime are pretty much just hypothetical. We don't know whether they actually happened, or if they're just a visual illustration of what COULD have happened if magic existed.\\n\\n\r\nART: 8/10. When I was watching Higurashi, especially the first season, I was like, \"dang, Studio DEEN, you're not always that great at this.\" But as time went on, I saw that art improve. I think that by the time this series came out, the art had improved a lot. I didn't have any complaints about the art in this series, nor do I remember even a single instance of animation that looked off-form or weird. The character designs are lovely and look great, the colors are rich, and the Victorian-styled setting is beautiful. Nothing really knocked my socks off about the art, but overall, it's pretty good, at least above average.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and also, the particular videos that I got of this series were censored. They had pixelated censors over any particularly gory scene. Now, censorship scares me more than any creepy murdering witch ever could, and I have to say that the censorship here completely sucks the enjoyment out of the gore in this show. I hope some uncensored versions are released soon.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 8/10. I don't always notice sound that much in anime, but there were a couple instances where I was like, this soundtrack is pretty awesome. Some of the background music in this anime is truly great. I also love the OP and ED. The OP is just straight-up epic, very heartfelt and emotional, and it fits the anime perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nThe ED took a bit longer to warm up to, since the guy who sings it has a pretty weird-sounding voice. However, as I got used to it, I really fell in love with it. It's raw, dramatic, and scary. The one thing is that I think for horror anime, sad songs work better as EDs- they really add punch to the tragic death scenes, while this ED sounds more angry. Then again, this anime doesn't give you much time to mourn the characters that die. They're really more like pawns in the game than people to feel sorry for.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 5/10. There are a LOT of characters in this anime, and they just keep adding more and more and more as it goes along. Even from the very first episode, you're hit in the face with at least 10 different characters, and I found it very hard to remember them. At least they all have the same last name. The sad thing about this is that, since there are so very many characters, none of them really get that much time to shine. Only a few characters (such as Maria and Ange) get background stories or character development.\\n\\n\r\nWhile most of the characters seem fairly well-thought-out, there are a few that left me asking, \"Why?!?!\" The prime offenders are the Siestas, who are just completely out-of-place in this anime. They look like stereotypical villains in a sci-fi magical girl fanservice anime. With bunny ears, crazy hair colors, whiny voices, and slutty costumes, they really took away my ability to take certain scenes seriously. Their hyper-precise death blows are very scary indeed, especially when they're ruining a touching scene by killing people out of nowhere, but why couldn't they have been more like the Stakes of Purgatory?\\n\\n\r\nKanon and his laser-sword-arm also take away from the creepy gothic feel of this anime, but some of the other characters ARE really awesome. Maria reminds me of Rena from Higurashi, with her crazy pendulum swinging between cutesy little girl and psycho killer. Bernkastel and Lambdadelta (who have some connection to Rika and younger-Takano from Higurashi) didn't get nearly enough screentime to do justice to their awesome little side story, and I hope there's a second season that explores them a little more.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 7/10. A lot of the time, I was just sitting through the Beatrice/Battler deduction scenes, because I couldn't follow Battler's logic at all. The scenes I really enjoyed were the grisly murder scenes... the touching scenes between lovers, especially when they were suddenly killed right afterward... and the scenes exploring the Rosa/Maria relationship, anything with Sakutaro, Ange's past, et cetera. It was often hard for me to keep up with all the new characters being introduced, though. I had a pretty decent time watching the anime.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 8/10. I think I enjoyed the concepts behind this anime more than the show itself. A lot of the time, the pacing was too fast to keep up with, and the events happening onscreen were too ambiguous to understand. However, when I finished watching the show, I found myself sitting and thinking, appreciating the concepts of witchcraft and the struggle between the humans and witches. For that reason, I think I'm going to check out the sound novel, since it probably goes into depth about those things a lot more.\\n\\n\r\nI'm hoping for a second season that will explain what's going on and unveil the mystery of the events on Rokkenjima Island. Kind of like what Kai did for Higurashi. The ending to this series was both satisfying and unsatisfying- it felt right, but left so much more to be explained. Ultimately, I'm hoping that even someone like me, who can't grasp Battler's detective reasoning at all, will be able to comprehend Umineko.",

Only 5 eps are out finishing a story arc like Higurashi and the plot twists are amazing.

            "content": "This review is based solely on the anime.\r\nThe Umineko franchise has a huge fan-base as it\u2019s based upon a popular Japanese murder mystery game and visual novels (VNs) made by 07Expansion. Most people who played the games and read the VNs are disappointed with the way Studio Deen presented Umineko to the big screen, particularly changes in the story and animation of the characters. My rating changed constantly throughout the series and resulted in a 5. It appeared as a show incredibly unique and original in the beginning but resulted in something totally bland and deficient in the end.\r\nStory (4):\r\nUmineko has an incredible plot consistingof a philosophical war between fantasy and reality. The anime began on an intriguing note as it introduced a murder mystery, but it progressed into something far too complex for 26 episodes, leaving the story with a major cliffhanger. Numerous questions were presented throughout the series, and nearly all of them were left unanswered. The content is hard to consume as so much info is thrown at you all at once, not to mention the multiple characters. The viewer will tend to become confused with the alternate universes and misdirections. E.g. A character can appear as an undefeatable supernatural being in one universe and a defenseless human in another, affecting the mystery-solving case. Additionally, some supernatural aspects were not explained.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime revolves around a fantasy vs. reality battle. Battler, one of the murdered family members, participates in a one-on-one logic battle with the Golden Witch Beatrice. Beatrice aims to make Battler acknowledge her as a witch, and Battler fights to prove that the murders were not the result of magic by providing logical explanations behind the murders. He does this by observing him and his family get murdered repeatedly in alternate universes. This strategy makes Umineko appear unique from other mystery anime, until Battler and Beatrice turn the gameplay into something dramatic. Their drama causes several distractions when they turn away from the mystery by throwing random insults at each other and going on non-speaking terms. The drama overshadows the main point of the story: the mystery. Their immaturity causes the series to become something silly instead of serious, and the anime ends with the mystery unsolved.\\n\\n\r\nUmineko served several misdirections in its plot. The game has rules that seem helpful in solving the mystery, but some rules were not presented until late in the game. One of those rules was the \u201cred truth.\u201d Beatrice uses the red truth in the game, declaring that everything she says in red is indeed the truth. The rule was that only a witch is able to use the red truth, but Battler does the same thing later. Like the \u201cred truth,\u201d some of the rules were misused, making them appear to be null and void. It would\u2019ve been a good strategy to solve a mystery, if it was actually factual and all rules were introduced at the start of the game.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (5): \\n\\n\r\nThere are a massive amount of characters (>30 people), and they quickly increase as the anime goes from one arc to the next. The game would\u2019ve been more enjoyable if it remained with the approximate 20 characters in the first arc. Because of the various characters, the mystery becomes even harder to solve as you have to understand the reason for their presence. The introduction to some characters were used to become observers (and interferers) of Battler and Beatrice\u2019s game, and it causes the drama to worsen throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nSome of the characters appear unbearably annoying in the beginning, but character development progresses as the story unfolds. It explains the meaning behind the characters\u2019 behavior by going into their past or behind-the-scenes during the murder cases. Thankfully, it focuses on the important characters and not waste time on the less active ones.\\n\\n\r\nBeatrice and Battler are the two MCs that people tend to either hate or love. Beatrice\u2019s personality changed constantly. She goes from fulfilling her role as the evil witch with clever tricks to a good witch by showing sympathy and being emotional, and the cycle repeats itself. I eventually gave up on trying to understand her and just watched the series. \\n\\n\r\nBattler is introduced to the series as a pervert, immediately giving the viewer the wrong impression of the series. Some of his points in the argument doesn\u2019t make sense, and he appears as a wimp by sometimes becoming emotional during the game. However, he\u2019s quite the persistent being who\u2019s determined to prove the non-existence of witches and magic, despite the various supernatural beings surrounding him. \\n\\n\r\nArt (10): \\n\\n\r\nSimilar to the Higurashi series, it\u2019s basically your typical Sh\u014djo artwork with big-eyed characters. Readers of the VNs and players of the game would most likely be appalled to see their characters drawn with big eyes. I exceptionally loved the artwork and European theme. The gory scenes, especially dismantled bodies, and well-animated backgrounds were drawn to fit the horrific theme of the anime. The characters' faces were drawn perfectly according to their emotions. E.g. The terror in their eyes is enough to terrify the viewer as murders commence. Also, Beatrice's face changes along with her personality. One moment she looks innocent, and she's looks evil and terrifying the next.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9): \\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED were amazing songs, and the lyrics give teasers about the series. The lyrics of the OP describe the night of the murders itself: \u201cThe banquet of the irregular night repeats itself again and again\u201d and the game between Battler and Beatrice \u201cDestroy these captured illusions.\u201d The ED is fast-paced and scarier with the creepy dark hallways of the mansion. The lyrics describe a person\u2019s desire to encounter Beatrice: \u201cOh beloved demon, grant me a wish.\u201d Creepy organ music played in the background sometimes, boosting the suspense of the series. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters reacted appropriately to numerous situations. The witches had their whole-hearty laughs. People mourned for their loved ones, and their reactions are so realistic.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (4):\\n\r\nHonestly, this is the worst mystery anime I\u2019ve ever seen. I was excited in the beginning with the unique plot and introduction of the game, thinking that I was in for a treat. However, I was disappointed and confused, especially with the ending. It was a major cliffhanger, and I found it mostly to be a drama instead of a mystery anime. I started reading the manga where the anime left off (Umineko no Naku Koro ni Chiru - Episode 5: End of the Golden Witch), and the drama worsened so much in the first few pages that I gave up on the Umineko franchise altogether.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (5):\\n\r\nUmineko appeared as a promising anime and turned into something tedious. Fans of mystery anime may become disappointed with a misleading story and a horrible ending. There are gory and disturbing images, but the mystery becomes unsolved with the viewer most likely being confused.",

            "content": "Please note: This review will be the review of an anime-only reviewer. I will not be comparing/lamenting the adaption quality.\r\nUmineko no Naku Koro ni is a fantastic story. Taking elements of both Eastern and Western mythologies, we are thrust into a battle between witches. A battle of fantasy vs reality, where we can trust nothing we see, and are forced to reason our way out of a labyrinth of lies.\r\nThe music is strong, if not particularly noteworthy. It supports the scenes well, but one will not be humming the themes walking down the street. The OP/ED are excellent, though. By now, we know that DEENis not a fantastic animation studio. It would come as no surprise that occasionally, there are some art problems. \\n\\n\r\nA very large part of the appeal of Umineko though, are the characters. By the end of the show, you know each character and love most of them. Each member of the family receives a time to shine. This is also supported by one of the most complicated, and interesting antagonists I've seen in anime, the Golden Witch, Beatrice. \\n\\n\r\nThe other main draw is the story. The issue with this, is that one cannot discuss it without giving away large plot points. Suffice it to say, that there are layers upon layers of plans, lies, and rules, both written and unwritten.\\n\\n\r\nUmineko is going to be a tough sell to later viewers, as a large part of the charm of the series is wildly speculating the questions of who and how. Ryukishi07 is a gifted writer, and anything by him will be an interesting journey, if nothing else. Do yourself a favor and don't rush through Umineko. Umineko isn't for everyone, but those who \"get\" it, will love it.",

Even if you have zero interest in VNs (I was like that), just forget about the series, since you might someday change your mind. \r\nThe original is a masterpiece. I personally gave it a 10/10 in vndb; the story is among the best I've ever seen in any medium. The anime, on the other hand, is nothing special; you'll run into entertainment of similar value everywhere. It's barely worth 6/10.\r\nI was introduced to Umineko through the anime. I had watched (and liked) Higurashi and had never read VNs before, so the idea of doing sohere never even crossed my mind. I was amazingly lucky, though, as after the first 9 or 10 eps I decided to try the VN for no real reason (I wanted to check whether it had a certain type of gameplay - it didn't). I found the visuals ridiculous, but I soon realized that the execution of the story was far, FAR better than in the anime. Once I had gotten used to the graphics, I was hooked.\\n\\n\r\nThe tldr reason for why the anime shouldn't exist: it leaves out tons of detail and butchers the emotional content of the rest of the story with its ridiculous pace. Calling this mediocre series \"Umineko no naku koro ni\" is pure blasphemy.",

            "content": "It's been a long while since I was active in the site.\r\nUmineko is somewhat of an \"sequel\" to the fantastic Higurashi series, although with almost no link between the two except for possibly 2 characters (which I will neglect to name to prevent spoilers). In October 1986, a group of 18 people, including members of the Ushiromiya extended family and their servants, decided to hold a meeting in their island, Rokkenjima, with the purpose of discussing how the wealth of the family is to be distributed after the death of the current head, Kinzo. Unfortunately, after the arrival of the entire family, a storm trapsthe 18 people, mysteriously preventing contact with the outside world. At this same point of time, members of the 18 slowly gets murdered one by one, usually in a bizzare manner, which was credited by Maria, the youngest member on the island, to be done by the endless witch Beatrice. However, her cousin, Battler, rejected any existance of witchcraft in the world, and thus, attempts to answer all the deaths via logic, an attempt which interests Beatrice herself...\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\r\nFirst of, I've never played the game, read the novel/manga or whatsoever. Thus, my only experience of the story is via the anime. Possibly based on that alone, I thought hte story was very well structured, with the exception of the 1st 2 episodes, which were absolute messes. However, I found it puzzling at a few aspects, including the fact that various supposed main characters, like Battler's stepmother Kyrie, to have so little screen time, and how some of the story plot just doesn't flow. Nevertheless, the story as a whole is above decent, and deserves praise.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nThe characters, the background, the golden butterflies representing Beatrice all look decent, but the blood as been censored too much IMO, but it's decent enough.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nMusic is an absolute nightmare, and I do not think the opening and ending themes match the anime at all.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nNow, for the long list of criticisms. As mentioned earlier, Kyrie was neglected any real screen time, which is a big nono, since she was supposed to be hte source of Battler's \"turn over the table\" motto. Characters were supposed to be interesting, but I found most of them to be annoying. Maria's just irritating, with her over-emo/creepy combo. George is a real... eyesore, Kinzo, supposedly a ruthless powerful man, was seen constantly crying, while Shannon and Kanon have been given inconsistent personalities as the story went on to the third arc. Battler, a supposedly intelligent person with a great logical view on the situation, has been seen just moaning about how he can't think of hte solution. The creators should really have looked to their efforts on Higurashi's characters while making this.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nTHis is given a 7 only because the story keeps me on the edge enough to want to watch ti weekly, rather than to force myself to complete the series.\\n\\n\r\nAsking a player of the game would get you a bad review on the story department as well, but if you're like me, and haven't played the game, the show is watchable, but beware of creepy lolis and a league of extraordinarily bad characters.",

            "content": "I'll start off with that i have not read the visal novel. This will be a review from someone who just watched an anime adaption without knowledge to its origin. The other review scores on MAL for this anime is such a rollercoaster, you have to make a choice. Is this really worth it to watch? I enjoyed this anime more than i hated it, hence the low overall score. But there are many things about this anime that is good if you count it as \"another anime\" and not an adaption.\r\nI'll skip the intro and get to the points:\r\nStory:\r\nWhat appears to be a simplemurder mystery turns into a mind battle of lies and truth in death note style. As in higurashi, you have several scenarios. One person go crazy, kill all, then it restarts with another person etc. In umineko's case it works the same. Just that it gets more and more... crazy involvements and for each reset is a new game which needs to be solved. It's a witch vs. Man battle. Where the man will deny the existence of witches, while the witch want the man to aknowledge them. With lots of confusing back stories, flashbacks which makes you go \"What the...?\" Many times. It's confusing but there is thoughts behind it. It'll be a 7.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nI don't understand why people slay this anime for it's \"horrible\" art. I think the art is one of the more beautifull i've seen. The art in the visual novel looks alot worse in my eyes(hence a reason why i don't want to play it). Sure all the females have big breasts except the little girl but i don't complain about that. But variaton in sizes is nice. I thought the art and details to environment, clothing, characters was gorgeous! A 9 from me here.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nI think most reviewers here will agree that the soundtrack in this anime is the strongpoint of it. I simply love the soundtracks, opening and ending! The music really sets the mood and i love how they put \"cartoon\" sounds into the funny moments. It really did give it a fuzzy charm. Another 9 from me!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nI'll agree. It's quite a large cast in this anime. And only being 26 episodes not all the characters have a chance for a backstory. But everyone has their own unique reactions and decisions which makes it good. You have the annoying little girl who can turn crazy at times. The objection pointing protagonist. The tsundere witch who is also evil. There are many characters here and i liked most of them. But i just can't stand those guys who have classes and act all sexy and hero. Too bad there is one of those here. I think the characters are given just the right amount of screen time for their roles and importancy. And they all look nice! An 8 from me.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nThis is a hard one. I enjoyed this anime very much. It got a beautifull soundtrack and gorgeous art to follow! A very big cast of characters is both nice and confusing. The amount of going back in time, flashbacks, backstories can really get on a person's nerve. I think anyone who watches this will go \"WTF?\" at least once. As i am not sure where this stands i give enjoyment a 6. The amount of \"good\" enjoyment overweight the \"bad\" enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nTo end this review i'd like to remind you reader. You don't need knowledge from the visual novel or mangas to enjoy this. You will get \"WTF?\" moments and you will get mind-raped. About the ending? It was an open one for sure. And i don't know if there will be a sequel. But in return for the mind-rape you will experience a very colourfull cast of characters, beautifull soundtrack and very nice visuals!\\n\\n\r\nI recomend this if you like occult themes, blood, gore and violence, murder mystery, magic and mind battles. What will your decision be?",

            "content": "Alright, let's do this:) First thing I have to say about Umineko , it really lef me with some mixed feelings.Since there's an enormous amount of hate going around regarding this anime, let me clarify to which part of the fanbase I belong. This way, it would be easier for you to spot any bias that might seep in later in the review:)\r\n1) I am a HUGE Higurashi fan: I breathe Higurashi, I think it is the best thing since hot water, blah, blah , blah, you get my point:)\r\n2) I have NOT read the Umineko Visual Novel , so I won't have any complaintsof the sort \"OMG, they left out ____\"\\n\\n\\n\r\nAlright, with that being said, here's my opinion:\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nFor me this is the most intriguing story that was never told.Why? I believe the setting of the novel is perfect for a mystery.Sure, it might be a blatant copy of Aghata Christie's \"Ten Little Niggers\", but having a group of people on a secluded island with mysterious murders going on always makes up for some good suspense.Plus, most characters seem to have interesting back stories.So , what went wrong? Well, this potential remains totally unexploited, since the story chooses to focus on the supernatural world, whose inhabitants are the least complex characters of the entire cast.Let's face it, demons and witches are made to represent certain human traits, so how can we really make them into fully fleshed out characters? I found myself enjoying the ( sadly too brief ) insight in the stories of Ange and Kyrie much more than the entire logic battle between Battler and Beato, the latter being way too confusing at times ( especially when the event discussed happened a couple of episodes ago and you hardly remember the details of it ).\\n\r\nIn short, the anime failed to create the deep bond between the viewer and the main characters that we had in Higurashi.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nIn general, very good.However, mouths and noses seem to disappear all too often.Also, censorship ticks me off on general principal, you either let an artist do a scene with gore , or you don't, pixelated cover-ups don't help the overall look.Can patches be released for an anime? We'll see with the dvd version, but untill then, art remains at 7/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nVery good voice acting, nice music ( very very epic OP and ED in my opinion ), what more can one  want?\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nAs stated in the story section, great cast of characters, but we don't see much of any of the interesting ones. If ( hopefully ) there's a next season, that might change ...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nIt was actually a good show.Although it was far from my expectations ( as I've said, higurashi fanboy ), it was quite enjoyable and I was constantly looking forward to my weekly golden witch fix.I do believe that I should re-watch all episodes back to back in order to fully appreciate it, since that would probably clear up a lot of confusion.So, if you're wondering if the show is worth it, give it a shot.And if you have that option DON'T read the VN beforehand:):)",

            "content": "My first review, probably won't be great.\r\nUmineko no Naku Koro ni. If you've seen it's precedes Higurashi no Naku Koro ni and Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai, then you should have about half a clue about what's going on. Umineko is similar to them, but WAY to different.\r\nDon't expect the same thing, but be prepared for alot of mind screw as the plot proceeds.\r\nStory - The story is great. I love how everything fits into place at some point. The anime is following the game's story fairly well, some things were left out, but no big deal.\r\nArt - The art, at a first look,I would rate it an 8. Very well done, but not the greatest. Once you start to watch the anime and game more, the way everything is designed fades, but still maintains a good level.\\n\\n\r\nSound - Probably my favorite part in Umineko. The sound is simply to wonder for words. Some of the BGM music was left out for certain things in the anime, but they still kept alot of important BGM's. The music is one of the reasons I've come to love this show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - All of the characters in the show are fine. Battler, the main character, I think he is being interpreted well in the anime, but he still differs from the game in a huge way. Maria is probably one of the cutest in the show, and one of the creepiest, which the anime plays horribly straight. Jessica is a great character, but the anime isn't showing her great side. They only show her as a damsel in distress, and haven't even began to show her better side, very sad. George isn't getting as much attention as he should in the anime. Like Jessica, he isn't getting his better side shown.\\n\\n\r\nThe parents, specifically Rosa and Eva, aren't getting what they should in the anime. Eva is being portrayed as a total freak in the anime, and Rosa, I bet her fan base has declined because of the anime. She was introduced as Eva x10 to me. All of the other parents are ether barely shown or don't have much known about them, including Kinzo.\\n\\n\r\nNow for Beatrice. She is only shown as some sadistic witch who only has pleasure in trying to get Battler to surrender. Her playful side isn't even shown. At some degree, her character is actually being portrayed well though, more her tsun side instead of her dere side.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - The show is about to enter Episode 4. I have to say, even though alot about the characters and some parts of the story was left out, it is a very good show. I have high hopes for the last question arc, and I know it should end well. Umineko is, certainly, a very well done anime.",

            "content": "When Seagulls Cry is an unorthodox approach to the psychological/thriller/murder genre. An interesting story reminiscent of Higu No series I find that this series carries a love/hate relationship (either you like it or you do not). What first attracted me to this series was mere coincidence and I am glad I have taken the plunge to indulge in this psychological caper. Without giving much away I'd like to introduce one of the two side s imperative to this series.\r\n[b]Fantasy[/b]\r\nYou believe in magic, witches and uuuu~ scary things that go bump in the night. this series relies on the premise that the outcomes are already decidedbut who is really behind these gruesome murders. Was there some human connection or is there really a component behind the Golden Witch. \\n\r\n[b] Anti-Fantasy[/b] \\n\r\nMagic is an illusion and while this group is a minority it is fun to speculate at the possibilities of how and (if your a Law and Order fan) who has the motive to kill all these people. A lot of critical details follow like Higu post-arc but lets say for now I have a peaked interest and a few theories to say that any side has plausible and weak arguments. \\n\\n\r\nImperatively, I find myself asking a lot of questions throughout the series that reflect the storytelling which is done in a very unique way. While one particular character stands out, Battler (who names their kid that anyway), interjects his quest to prove that no magic is involved often throws quite a few logical fallacies our way). Of course, there are contradicting elements throughout the story.\\n\r\nFor example, there is Maria the character we love to hate who sides on the fantasy realm. While she is approximately six there is something more that meets the eye with her (besides wanting to punch her in the face half the time). \\n\\n\r\nInterestingly, I hope to update this as we go along but as you have no doubt read the premise this tale hopefully lives up to your and my own expectations.",

            "content": "Umineko no Naku Koro Ni could be considered the little brother of the oh so high praised Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni. This being, the expectation were exceptionally high for this series. Many say though, that the Adaption itself was shit. I, who hasn't read the Visual to neither Higurashi nor Umineko can't tell. But what I can tell is what I got as an Anime itself. And that shall be presented here:\r\nStory: The story of Umineko is just as Higurashis really complex and seems to quite equal to it. But as soon you reach a certain episode you might realize, that it is not!\r\nThestory takes place on an island called Rokkenjima. One day the head of the rich Ushiromiya family, Ushiromiya Kinzo, invites all his children and grandchildren to come to his island. Here the actual story is going to get started. After a bit of talk and backgroundknowledge, some people get brutally murdered. Soon it turns out, that those shouldn't stay the only ones getting killed. One after another the whole supporting and even the main cast gets wiped out. The end? No. Not even close. As you might have guessed the whole thing works the same way as Higurashi does and different archs continue this slaughter in different ways.\\n\r\nThe whole story has a heck of a lot of twists but it sometimes fails in keeping you concentrated and you might get a bit confused about how everything worked out this way.\\n\r\n8\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The whole character list for this Anime is far too long to list everyone here, so I'll just name the few that get the most screentime, which are Ushiromiya Battler, who is the one that has to solve the whole riddle. He is more of a fighting style character, but does lose his confidence sometimes, which makes him a bit more human.\\n\r\nThe next one is the golden eternal witch Beatrice, which is a cruel witch, that kills everyone for the sake of her revival. She is the opponent of Battler and is our typical psycho-antagonist.\\n\r\nThe supporting cast is as I said earlier really big, with it holding every single bit of the Ushiromiya Family and their servants. They are giving a lot of careful attention to them though, explaining a whole lot of background, which makes everything much more deep.\\n\r\n8\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art isn't really a master piece. It is well done for it's time but by now quite aged. The character design, does look good if you compare it to the original one (which I saw on some pics). I mean...seriously the original one was crap.\\n\r\n6\\n\\n\r\nSound: The Sound of Umineko does always fits well to the tone the Anime does currently have, but never is somewhat memorable. I found myself listening and singing with the Opening many times though. Espacially the ending always made me hyped for the next  episode. The Opening just fit really well to the whole show (even though I liked Higurashi's more at this point)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: If Umineko no Naku Koro Ni lacks one thing it is continuity. There are many points, that just make you go \"wtf? What just happened?\" If you aren't prepared for some oddly placed Shounen scenes and some random fanservice (it is not much though), that sometimes don't really fit the show's theme, than you will be really surprised by this (at least I was). There were points in the show where I almost sopped watching during an episode due to boredom.\\n\r\nOn the other hand, there were also parts, that hooked me so much, that I actually jumped out of my seat (I mean...literally). Combined with the ending that effect was even better.\\n\r\n7\\n\\n\r\nSummary: In total, the whole plot of Umineko is really interesting. It has a good idea, has a lot of good characters and a heck of a fanbase loving the VN. But as we know DEEN, they like to disappoint us whenever we are expecting the highest. They had many points, were they executed it brilliantly but also many points, were they did it just as poorly. It got me hooked and it got me bored. So I give it in total a 7/10",

The thing with this anime is that you have to pay close attention to all the little details to discover who the murderer is and your probably gonna have to rewatch some episodes to fully get it if u want to discover who the killer is for yourself.or if urather u can just watch the series and let the main protagonist solve it for u but i like solving these sort of things myself before they do.

At first I hated it because it confused the hell out of me. When I started to understand at least some bit of what was going on, I started really wanting to like it. But so much seemed missing while watching the anime. I decided to do what I have never done before, and I read the VN.

Nowafter completing both the anime and the VN (1-4), I can see why so many people are upset.\\n\\n\r\nStory (5/10)\\n\r\nThe pacing. YOUR GOING TO FAAAST. SLOOOW DOWN!

When anime adaptations have to cut a lot to fit the anime's length, character development is usually where it hits. And it really did.

If season 2 gets animated, I'll watch it too with this same logic.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (6/10)\\n\r\nOverall the anime while generally enjoyable was pretty mediocre; however, if you think the story of Umineko no Naku Koro ni in general is mediocre, you should give the visual novel a try.

            "content": "*This review contains spoilers.*\r\nConsidered by many to be the spiritual successor of Higurashi, Umineko has never managed to achieve the same amount of popularity as the former and has never been received as well. Now, Umineko is an adaptation of the Visual Novel (VN) with the same name - a VN with high emphasis on atmosphere, a VN with complex characters that are all related to each other with a lot of backstory progressively revealed, a VN with a complex narrative structure, a VN that contains over 1.3 million english words, a VN that needs well over 120 hours to complete. I want to askyou a simple question: Do you really think an Anime with only 26 episodes (~8 hours) can do the VN justice? If your answer is yes, then congratulations, you can skip the rest of this review and go watch Umineko.\\n\\n\r\nThe point of my review is not to praise the VN over the Anime. I do believe every piece of art has a standalone value. An Anime does not get worse just because a VN exists - Anime has its own merits. However, Umineko is flawed in many areas and to fully understand why, you have to take a look at the source material. That is my intention. Not saying \"the VN is better\", but I want you to understand why the Anime is bad.\\n\\n\r\n1.) Story\\n\\n\r\nFirst off, the Anime covers roughly half of the story from the VN. It may sound weird, but that was a rather good decision on Studio Deens part, as a full story adaptation would have made Umineko probably the worst Anime ever due to being even more condensed. However, stopping after the first half leaves many many questions and plot points open that are resolved later in the VN.\\n\\n\r\nAnother problem is the high density of events that are happening. Every \"episode\" (this is what chapters are called in the VN) usually takes 20+ hours to complete and has been stuffed into an arc of 4 to 6 episodes length. Many dialogues and key story elements have been omitted and as such, it's impossible to get to the truth behind every murder. Every arc in Umineko is full of plot holes because scenes from the VN were randomly selected, adapted and stacked together. One such example of a plot hole is during the second \"episode\" (chapter) when Shanon commits suicide. In the anime, the stake is stuck in her forehead, which should be impossible since she committed suicide and it should be lying by her side. As such in the Anime, this case seems like a perfect closed room murder and is not solvable even though it should. There are other inconsistencies thoughout the plot, also some minor ones (like in \"episode\" (chapter) 3, Rudolf and Kyrie are killed in the corridor and then shown in the grand hall), but yeah, you should get the general idea of my point.\\n\\n\r\nUmineko is a work focused on mystery. Mystery is the most interesting when the reader (or viewer in that case) is able to follow the mystery and is able to craft his own theories based on the clues presented throughout the story. This is possible (though insanely hard) in the VN, but at times impossible in the Anime. This partly because the story is not complete but also due to the aforementioned plot holes. As such, I think the Umineko Anime misses its goal of being a good mystery Anime.\\n\\n\r\n2.) Characters\\n\\n\r\nUmineko has a diverse cast of mostly adult or young adult characters and a complex weave of relationships between all those characters. Every character has a lot of focus throughout the chapters in the VN but nothing of that remained in the Anime. The characters were mostly reduced to their single most defining personality trait and due to the nature of such traits, some characters ended up utterly detestable. One such example would be Rosa, who has sparked many memes throughout the community. Yes, she is extremely unlikable in the Anime due to the way she neglects and at times physically assaults her daughter, but the Anime does not do her personality justice in any way. It is only the VN that gives insight on her difficult relationship to her siblings and the circumstances that made her a single mother.\\n\\n\r\nDue to the fact that most characters are (at best) plot devices, it's hard to feel anything about them. They are shallow and one dimensional, why should anyone care if they are killed off?\\n\\n\r\n3.) Art & Sound\\n\\n\r\nWell, Studio Deen has never been known for their outstanding production quality, at least not during the 2000s. Fate/stay night and Higurashi have already suffered from extremely bad animation und as you may guess, Umineko has suffered the same fate. The character designs look simple and shabby, faces or shapes are deformed and background images are lacking detail.\\n\\n\r\nProbably one of the few positive aspects of the Anime is that some of the VN soundtracks are used in the Anime. Uminekos sound collection in the VN is huge and consists of over 200 classical-like music pieces to support the atmosphere. It was definitely a good choice to reuse them. The opening and ending theme were also relatively good, much to my surprise.\\n\\n\r\n4.) Conclusive words\\n\\n\r\nLooking at the Anime alone, we have a rather interesting setting (murders within a family on a secluded island) but only an average story with common plot holes and bad characters. I cannot list many positive aspects of Umineko as the Anime doesn't do anything outstanding besides its uncommon setting. I cannot understand how anyone would perceive the Umineko Anime as a masterpiece when in fact it has plot holes all over the place (which is extremely critical for a mystery Anime) among severe other flaws.\\n\\n\r\nYes, the Anime managed to keep the narrative structure mostly (though I found the visual indicators to distinct between the gameboard and the meta world not clear enough, but maybe that's just me) and some of the atmosphere but besides that it just used a pre-existing story and characters and chopped them together into an unwatchable clusterfuck. Do yourself a favor and read the VN (or at least the Manga) if you're seriously interested in Umineko.\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion, Umineko is a candidate for the worst VN adaptation out there.\\n\\n\r\n2/10",

            "content": "There were two reasons why I decided to watch Umineko: [1] I heard it was a \"sister\" anime of Higurashi (I liked Higurashi) and [2] I was expecting a lot of killing and blood and killing and blood and...oh you get it :) Umineko no Naku Koro ni revolves around the Ushiromiya family, who have gathered in the family's island for the first time during the year 1986 to discuss the inheritance of the family-head-status. \r\n        Suddenly, someone from the eighteen people - the family, five servants, and the family doctor - is murdered after every few hoursor minutes. These murders seem to be point to the fictional character (to the characters in the anime, of course) Beatrice the Golden Witch. Battler Ushiromiya (the main protagonist), who doesn't believe in magic but doesn't want to blame anyone of the 18, tries to find another person to blame. In the end, however, everyone is killed and Beatrice shows herself to a shocked and suspicious Battler. The story then becomes a battle of wit to prove (on Beatrice's side) or disprove (on Battler's side) the existence of witches.\\n\\n\r\n        Story: 7 \\n\r\n        Like Higurashi, Umineko was crazy enough to incite repulsion because of all the gore and curiosity because of its twists. Unlike Higurashi, however, it wasn\u2019t interesting or exciting enough to keep the viewer interested with the constant repetition of what happened during that time. Moreover, the logic puzzles presented in the anime were more exhausting, rather than stimulating, to think of.\\n\\n\r\n        Art: 9 \\n\r\n        On the other hand, the art was cool. Since the story was set on 1986, their clothes were pretty, big, and elegant Victorian dresses (that I would like to wear ~grin). Since it\u2019s also a recent anime, the animation was good too. \\n\\n\r\n        Sound: 10 \\n\r\n        The sounds were my favorite (loving music doesn\u2019t have anything to do with it! *pinky swear)! They totally got me into mood from excited (0.0) to nauseous (-.-) to shock (\u2018o\u2019). It was even better than the Avatar soundtracks! Okaaaaay, that last sentence was random :)\\n\\n\r\n        Character: 7 \\n\r\n        Just because the characters look good and wear cool clothes, doesn\u2019t mean that the characters are cool too. In fact, this is the first anime that I couldn\u2019t choose a favorite because all the characters were either not interesting enough or just really annoying (it isn\u2019t just because of my hater-ism! ~smile). Although there were times when Battler was cool, he got really stubborn and had poor logic reasoning (as if I was THAT good in logic ~grin). I also like Beatrice at one point until she laughed that annoying, loud laugh and then \u201cpoof!\u201d she became an annoying, loud, ugly frog (witch->frog. Get it?? ~laughs at self) :D\\n\\n\r\n        Enjoyment: 6 \\n\r\n        Like I said, there wasn\u2019t enough exciting logic puzzles or cool death scenes for me to enjoy the anime. Haaaaa\u2026 I really miss the Higurashi gores (~evil laugh).  \\n\\n\r\n        So I guess that if you\u2019re looking for the gore and wickedness that Higurashi delivered, you shouldn\u2019t expect much from this film. It was just bloody. Uhm, if you like thinking, though, you might want to consider this. That\u2019s it I guess :)\\n\\n\r\n        Nwah! (o\u2018.\u2019o)\\n",

However, the score went down a bit because of the confusing moments that occurred throughout the anime.\r\nArt = 10/10 The art work in this anime was phenomenal. There was so much detail to everything (especially the golden butterflies) and the colours they chose for the anime truly creates an creepy and dark atmosphere.\r\nSound = 8/10 The music was done very well. The score is actually what attracted me to this anime. Also, this anime has one of the best openings I have heard in a while. However, my main problem with the soundtrackwas that, apart from two songs (Thanks for Being Born and Katayoku no Tori), the music wasn't very memorable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters = 7/10 The characters' designs were amazing and all of the characters had a clear cut personality. Also, all of the voice acting was very well done (Beatrice's especially). I would also like to add that I really enjoyed how all of the women in this anime were all very strong and powerful. It's rare to see that especially in anime because they are usually perceived as cute and weak. Unfortunately, the main problem with this anime's characters was that there is no room for true character development within the game board because every time a character made any form of character development, they would simply reset. As a result, only those that were watching the game board could have any form of development (AKA Beatrice and Battler). Unfortunately, none of them ever go through character development, which lead for the score to be a 7/10 instead of a 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment = 9/10 I did enjoy this anime very much. It was very creepy and I never got bored whatsoever. My only issue, like I mentioned before, was that it got very confusing at times. Otherwise, I really did enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall = 8/10 This anime was definitely not bad. It did many things very well but it also failed in certain aspects. And although I did enjoy it, I wouldn't really recommend this anime if someone were to ask me which one they should watch. This isn't the best anime for sure, but if you have nothing better to do, this would be an efficient and fun way to consume your time.",

            "content": "If you're going to watch Umineko no Naku Koro ni... Do NOT expect any answer to the Mystery you are going to see. You won't have any answer. Is this a Bad thing ?... It can be but, if you watched Higurashi before... by now, you should get it : This is how the Story is told ! So... Yes, i am telling you. After 26 episodes, you still won't get it. \r\nWhat was great with Higurashi it's that even after 26 episodes, you had a little bit of the answer... not all of them but, still. AND... there's another season of Higurashi. Umineko don'thave any... and I'm not sure it's going to have one so... you will propably never have any answer to your questions. You will want those answer really bad tho ! \\n\\n\r\nAnd that's where the Sound Novel comes in ! \\n\\n\r\nUmineko is kind of 'like' Higurashi in the way the story is told. You will have the 'Question Arc'. Four of these. That's where the anime stop. Those are just... completely... Confusing.\\n\\n\r\nFor the Answer... you'll have to rely on the Sound Novel and that's not a bad thing because the Sound Novel is awesome.\\n\\n\\n\r\n- STORY\\n\\n\r\nLet's be honest, Umineko is having a really original story also very complex and that's what's getting you into the story asking yourself all the question you should be asking yourself until the Answer Arc. The Anime failed at this part. To have a change to get the mysterie, you need details. You need to know the character. You need to know everything. Who's wearing the Golden Wing on his outfit ? Who isn't ? Who was where at this moment ? Who could have done this or that ? It's a Mystery and if Battler wants to say Beatrice isn't the culprit... he will definitly need a real culprit. Then... Who is it ?\\n\\n\r\nLots of thing were left behind making people misunderstanding that show. They sure had to cut stuff because they're so much more in the game but... maybe they tried to do that too much or cut the wrong stuff. I don't know.\\n\\n\r\nI would have done 10 for sure in the Novel but since the anime screwed up it's going to be a 8.\\n\\n\\n\r\n- ART\\n\\n\r\nI liked it. The Troll face were nice ( I'm thinking of Eva-Beatrice and Beatrice herself here, eheh! ) It's definitly not the Best Art i've seen but it was good. Really good if I think about the horrible art Higurashi had...\\n\\n\\n\r\n- SOUND\\n\\n\r\nI have nothing to complain about the sound. They took the music from the Novel and put it into the anime and the Music in the Novel is good. It's not called a Sound Novel for nothing, eh ! The only thing I would complain about is that they put the song at some random moment at time but it wasn't out of place really it was just... different. I'm thinking about Mirage Coordinator. That song wasn't played at the Scene with Maria and her mother but it made the scene epic in the anime somehow. \\n\\n\\n\r\n- CHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nThis is probably the place were everything went... an horrible way. In the anime, Battler looks like a Kid arguing about something he can see. He looks ridiculous even if some scene still show him the 'badass' way he actually is when he's all mighty in front of Beatrice. Then, he goes down to crying like a crybaby and it doesn't make any sense in the Anime when actually.. it does !\\n\\n\r\nLet's make something clear right away...\\n\r\nThis goal of Battler isn't to deny magic everywhere. It's just about denying magic at this moment on this island. He doesn't care about what's outside. He's not fighting for that. All he wants to show is that this could have been done by a human therefore he have to suspect someone ! Until then... Magic can exist at this moment in this island.\\n\\n\r\nAll of this wasn't made clear at all in the anime making people confusing about stuff they shouldn't be worrying about but instead use to understand. \\n\\n\r\nBeatrice just looks like a Tsundere Girl it can be annoying at times and she looked maybe too kind at times.\\n\\n\r\nAnd let's not talk about all of the relatives... None of them got enough air time to make the viewer understand them, know them and finally love them and reach Battler's issue : Being unable to believe one of his loved relatives killed the others !\\n\\n\\n\r\n- ENJOYEMENT\\n\\n\r\nI don't know if that's just me but... I loved the show. I wanted it every week when it came out. I could watch the same episode twice and finally, it made me try to be able to play the Sound Novel. \\n\\n\\n\r\nNow... Let's talk about the Ending of the Show. I said before the ending wasn't suposse to, and isn't going to, answer any of your question. Actually the Ending of the anime feels like a joke. Everything ! All of it. That's where the lacks of character developpement couldn't help the ending at all so... it failed. I would recommend another ending if found on youtube. It was kind of Fan Made I think but it was awesome and really helped.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, I'll try to find it back. Tell me if you want the Link. It was much better and closer to the actual ending for the 4th Arc.\\n\\n\r\nI hope this review won't scare you because you really should give it a try ! and if you like it... Maybe you could play the Novel !\\n\r\nI can garante you won't regret it.",

Some similar characters are introduced in Umineko compared to Higurashi, but they are not exactly the same people. It gets really confusing and mysterious, and you have to bare with it until the end. There is this never ending cycle of death in these animes, and you will wonder why, but later on, it willbe explained why these conflicts are happening; actually, it will pull you in, and it will make you wonder. This anime is really a wonderful anime and I gave a 10/10 :)",

Do you believe you're fighting for something? For more than your survival? Can you tell me what it is? Do you even know? Is it freedom? Or truth? Perhaps peace? Yes? No? Could it be for love? Illusions, Mr. Anderson. Vagaries of perception. The temporary constructs of a feeble human intellect trying desperately to justify an existence that is without meaning or purpose. And all of them as artificial as the Matrix itself, although only a humanmind could invent something as insipid as love. You must be able to see it, Mr. Anderson. You must know it by now. You can't win. It's pointless to keep fighting. Why, Mr. Anderson? Why? Why do you persist?\\n\\n\r\nNeo: Because I choose to.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally I enjoyed the series. Why do I like it so much in contrast to the harsh opinions of my peers? \\n\\n\r\nOne thing is for sure, people lose sight that the most important thing about being human is that we choose to be human, we choose to be stubborn, irrational, and ignorant despite the fact the truth is right in front of us. Human tenacity is simply amazing, how we constantly fight on and on. Despite the odds despite the fact we may be wrong, we can choose to fight and persist in what we believe in and this is precisely the case with Battler, who constantly denies the existence of magic throughout the series despite the fact it's right in front of him. You're probably thinking, \"This reviewer is a complete idiot.\" People make the mistake tenacity is always the bad ignorance that exists in this world. At times they are the same thing, but we cannot forget that it is the same tenacity that led to the exploration of ideas and creation of inventions we use every day. Before the space travel was possible, people believed anyone who dreamed of traveling to the moon as mentally unbalanced or just plain stupid. Those scientists who had the drive to make space travel possible constantly ignored the harassment and ridicule of their peers through their own tenacity and perseverance to make their own dreams come true. As a result those same people that were called \"loony\" are the most respected people in our society and they've bestowed upon us technologies, such as cell phones and silicon computer parts, for our everyday use that we usually take for granted. I liked Battler's constant endurance throughout the series, he never gives in despite the odds. Call him stupid, but just like us, he never knew what was going to happen in the end. He fights not because he's denying magic, but because he refuses to accept such a fate as a mysterious and brutal death. Battler fights for what he believes in despite what others may think and this catches on with all the other characters toward the end of the series. Jessica, George, and many others begin to fight fate rather than accept it, because it's fate that denies them their dreams and hopes of the future. Sometimes we don't realize this, but fate can be changed. Despite the fact the world comes down around us, we can make the best of it and change the current environment into something positive in order to bring about a better tomorrow. We can criticize their character and actions since we have hindsight of the entire series, but, everyone's, especially Battler's, tenacity, sense of justice, and value for life is something to be admired until the end of the series.\\n\\n\r\nOn the flip side, Beatrice we can all the \"sum of all fears.\" She in the beginning, is the epiphany of cruelty, sadism, and blindness. She is what I see as the people who harass and ridicule those who believe in something that they truly put their hearts in. However, I've learned, especially in the recent months, that people aren't cruel on purpose. I've began talking with peers at my school who have harassed and constantly put me down. I discovered that while some of them acted out in blind ignorance due to their superior status as the Valedictorian or star athlete without any past consideration for feelings (much like Beatrice), a lot of them have personal problems, problems that really dwarf my own problems. Most of both parties forget that I'm a human too, not just that little quiet person in the classroom and, as a result, cause a lot of unnecessary tension and anger. Of course when people begin to understand each other, that's when they can put aside differences and work together toward common goals. You can always simplify Beatrice being a tsundere character, but I always like to find deeper meaning in any anime I watch rather than criticize it for some bad faults. We should always keep in mind the there are messages that the author sometimes wants to get across and uses the cover \"entertainment\" to keep that message hidden. Why? Well if the message was so obvious then we wouldn't be able to appreciate it more would we? \\n\\n\r\nHowever, everyone is blind to the one invisible magic that brings about happiness in the world. That magic is love. Without love we wouldn't have actions such as forgiveness or kindness. We would fuel ourselves with hate and anger and lead very self-destructive lives in the process.  There's also the magic of choice, because we choose to do something that we do it. Battler fights against magic not necessarily because he hates it, but because he refuses to acknowledge defeat that would forever leave the fate of his family a mystery, and a cruel fate that would be.\\n\\n\r\nThe actual game is something very interesting because of its unstable and volatile nature. So many lopsided rules and its very tricky. For the most part, I was able to keep up with non-magic conjectures and I came out with a few of my own that could have worked out. The text colors were the really difficult parts because they can slash out a ton of conjectures that were once viable and now null. I thought it was fun, though I was looking forward to the use of the purple text from the original sound novel.  It's disproving that a murder was caused my magic. Despite the fact it is perceived that it was caused by magic, there's always Schr\u00f6dinger's cat: Battler wasn't there during the incidents, neither were we. Although the witch presents it to us as magic, it could have been done by human hands. Who knows? Maybe the Beatrice never needed the sacrifices, she was just playing God the entire time using magic. Maybe Beatrice is Battler's near-death experience, Battler fighting himself to live for the sake of his family. Maybe Beatrice is completely real and all that magic is presented to us as complete truth. We can never be certain. Just as there's no way we can prove that even our reality is corporeal or illusion, we cannot prove if the visible \"magic\" presented to us it physically real or false.\\n\\n\r\nOnward with the review:\\n\\n\r\nStory (8): We can all the story a game. A game that tests our wits and creativity. A game the really tests us to see whether we can find plausible solutions to an increasingly difficult dilemma. It's almost like an advanced science, where deeper and deeper research into more vague and difficult problems become close to impossible. It's a gamble, you never know what's going to happen. But we know the more risk we take, the less we would succeed. However, the payoff is much greater, therefore at times it's worth the risk. It applies to us in real life. In science, the more difficult problems scientists tackle, the less likely they'll come up with solutions to those problems. However, if they do come with solutions then they've contributed a lot more to society and built a new bridge into larger, unknown territory of study than if they took small problems and solved them easily. Battler faces an ever daunting battle with Beatrice that tests his resolve, wits, and risk. He takes a huge risk facing all odds for the sake of living, for the sake of avenging his family for such misfortune and sadness, for the sake of love. He might lose over and over again for taking such an enormous risk, but if he wins in the end, it will payoff substantially. I liked the game a lot, therefore I gave the game or the \"story\" it's high rating.\\n\\n\r\nArt (6): Victorian-styled, wealthy class art was smooth and clean. The background and setting were all done really well. Character design was simple, but got across their personality really well. The one thing that really turned me off was the obvious fan-service done to most of the female characters. I mean if you're planning to do a serious series of wit and thinking, then at least make the characters serious. I mean yes breasts would be pretty obvious with the Victorian dresses they wear that tightly holds their waist and show off their busts, but the size of those breasts are enormous. On top of that, they add bunny homunculi halfway through the series, bloody bunny homunculi! If I knew any better this series would have been a blasted hentai game in disguise. It's a mystery-psychological series. If they made the breast sizes of most of the female characters more natural and regular, as well as keep to the wealthy, Victorian style of art, then it would have contributed to the overall serious mood of the series. \\n\\n\r\nSound (9): I loved the OP. In one word, it was epic. The overall music and voice acting was done really well, none of the voices stood out of place and the background music contributed to the overall mood of the series quite nicely. In fact, the voices of the characters were done extremely well. I really was disgusted by characters such as Eva and Rosa whose voices contributed so well to their overall despicable characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (4): Despite the fact I loved heroes such as Battler and Ange, as well as antagonists, like Eva and Rosa, I really hated the lack of character development for most of the characters. Yes we know it's a psychological-mystery thriller and you're supposed to include a lot of characters for red herring purposes to keep us busy, but none of those characters can be used as red herrings, or even culprits, because the lack a defining characteristic or fact that helps describe their alibis. I've read a a good number of mystery novels, and each one always gives at least a defining detail of character that may have helped us solve the mystery or drove us into the completely wrong direction with the red herring. Heck they might have left even a small quirky hint that would allow us to make conjectures to certain characters we read about in the mystery. Unfortunately Umineko doesn't accomplish this in the slightest bit and just puts out characters in this story just as lambs for the slaughter, serving no purpose other than to be killed rather than to lead us off and trick us.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9): It was fun playing the game. One thing is for sure. If you're looking for a mystery that resolves itself at the end, then Umineko is not the series for you. If you're looking for something that constantly makes you brainstorm, use your wits, and makes you ponder quite a bit, then Umineko is something youwould enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7): Basically speaking, the series is good if you like to think quite a bit and can find a lot of positives and reflections in the series. If you're looking for straight out entertainment or emotion, this is not the series for you.",

            "content": "I'll warn about spoilers, but they're pretty much identical to most complaints already listed here so not much in the way of spoilers. They relate to the completeness of the anime.\r\nYou've been warned.\r\nOk, so this anime doesn't actually have an ending. It's such a mess you can hardly tell if you're still looking at the same anime from episode to episode, as things such as alternative timelines, alternative realities, fake scenarios and pure and simple lies appear on screen for most of the run time. I am purely an anime viewer; I don't know where this came from, and to be completely honest I don'treally care either. I heard quite a lot was cut out of this show, and that originally it did follow some resemblance of structure, rules and viewers could actually tell scenarios apart. However, that much is not true here.\\n\\n\r\nIf I had to establish a comparison to what watching this show feels like, I would probably say this is the \"Lost\" of anime. There's intricate plot right at the beginning that pulls you in; the uncertainty of whether what's happening is supernatural or cold blooded murder was, to me, quite fascinating to watch. Then it's set aside. Then there's another one. Then the flashbacks begin. Then the flash forwards. Except the flash forwards are of an alternate timeline. Come to think of it, this might be a straight adaptation of lost. However, Lost certainly had one thing over this show: at least when it ended, for better of for worse, it was truly the end. Without wanting to spoil it too much: No, you won't be told the accurate answers to the riddles put in place (they even taunt the viewers about it near the end in a post-credits scene). No, you won't be able to re-view the events as they actually happened.\\n\\n\r\nI consider this failure to wander in the mystery/horror category, although there's not much in the way of horror after a few episodes when everything starts happening in the open. So it fails as horror. And considering that it doesn't even bother to actually solve the mystery it suggested in the first place in any way, shape or form, it also fails as a mystery. An argument could be made that part of the fun is finding out by yourself. The issue is, there's simply not enough info at play here. Towards the end it's hard to even tell what the show is trying to do, considering the focus of the show shifts from solving a mystery about a possible supernatural murder to... punching the hell out of demons and then trying to justify that it didn't happen. I hear that makes more sense in the source's setting, where everything was correctly explained. However, here, it feels like they're quite literally punching the shit out of Jesus and then claiming he doesn't exist at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 0\\n\\n\r\nI don't consider this show to have a story. A story has a beginning, a development and an end, and preferably those three acts are at least vaguely connected. The beginning is there, and it is undoubtedly the best part. The middle is unrecognizable from the beginning, and often times you'll be wondering what you should be trying to figure out as a viewer of a show that is supposed to be about solving a murder, as the show drags on about character development in flashbacks, alternate settings, flashforwards, alternate realities, et cetera. I'm not saying that character development is bad. I'm just saying it shouldn't stand in the way of the show, but it should naturally accompany it, not hold it up for a whole episode and then resume the murder mystery scene.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 4\\n\\n\r\nI don't care about the art. It didn't look amazing. There was a bit of gore. Yay.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\\n\r\nI care even less about the sound. The kid was unbelievably obnoxious. There was some nice classical music. Most of the \"young\" voice actors made me want to punt them, hard. Realistic, I guess.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3\\n\\n\r\nIf I were to remove about 10 episodes in the middle of the show, I would probably rate this higher. However, at a certain part around the middle of the show character development got really, really weird. It would be a safe bet to say most of the \"evil\" characters were off their bipolar meds when they woke up that month. I somewhat enjoyed the MC for once (in an endearing sort of way), shame it was wasted on such a mess of a show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1\\n\\n\r\nIt's hard to make things retroactively bad. I enjoyed the first mystery. I enjoyed the first \"red text\" interaction. That being said, I enjoyed them because they provided me with the tools I thought I would need to put together to figure out the true nature of what happened. It's like buying a box of legos, assembling the build only to find out that while you have the wheels, the steering wheel and the spoilers for your f1 lego car, the whole chassis and the pilot are missing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 1\\n\\n\r\nWhole lot of hype for no reveal. Had I known, I wouldn't have bothered.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Have you ever woke up from a hangover and then worry that you did something you'd regret? Well, at least you didn't write the script for this series. \r\nUmineko was an anime that showed great promise, trying to be an intellectual puzzle that would have viewers trying to analyze details and scramble for nuances. After all, it has much to live up to its predecessor Higurashi. The basic premise is to solve a mystery through logical means rather than the magical ones that show up and are far more convenient. \r\nWhile it seems counter intuitive that you'd use magic to deny magic, it's important torealize that magic could exist, but there's still a logical (non-magic) reason to explain the story . (Even if there are magical means to do something, it doesn't mean you have to use magic to do it.)\\n\\n\r\nAnyhow, that was pretty much all I gathered from the show before it decided to meander into the realm of nonsense. I've never played the original game, but it's obvious facts were left out, because the connection between events are minimal and was left wondering \"what does that have to do with anything??\" at every turn.\\n\\n\r\n The plot seems to take so many dead ends and go off into random tangents that later parts feel more like a Family Guy episode. In other words, the storytelling is laughable and there's no cohesion whatsoever. It makes no sense!\\n\\n\r\nThe main issue was the pacing. With poor prioritization of events, it was hard to follow the show. It did good in some spots, but it would dwell a bit too long, hurting other parts that get fast forwarded. For the most part, sometimes the intention is there, but not the execution. The result is that you get events that should make you feel for the characters and what could happen, but it just lands with a thud because it gets rushed. There are of course a few exceptions that were handled very well (typically at the end of a chapter) but those tend to be rare.\\n\\n\r\nIn other words, it's just not enough to list events A,B,C,D. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is ok most of the time, but it suffers from the stupid faces Higurashi liked so much. The music is arguably the best part of the anime, but it was oddly misused at points. However, I would definitely say that's one thing memorable I got from this show. The opening is epic, and the ending is crazy, much like the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are largely bland, but that's a bit forgivable since there's so many of them. The ones that they do focus on, particularly Maria and Beatrice are well done. There are also quite a few emotional moments to be found near the end; I guess the writers sobered up. There is one character near the end that is exceptionally done-- you'll know when they appear. The antagonists are extremely... colorful. \\n\\n\r\nDespite all of this criticism, this is hardly a terrible show. I found it more enjoyable when I stopped taking it seriously and went along for the ride-- how does someone enjoy something by nitpicking constantly?  It's a pretty good comedy actually (Some intentionally, surprisingly) Every week, I'd tune in to see what other increasingly ridiculous outfits and twists the show could come up with.  Add in a few legitimately touching moments, and it becomes a good watch that makes you morbidly curious. \\n\\n\r\nI reject the pretentious notion that a show has to be all deep and coherent, and must excel in all categories to be considered of quality. Anime is an entertainment medium and the most important thing is that it makes you want to watch. And it did keep me watching.\\n\\n\r\nThe very end is unforgivable though... it kinda just leaves you out there and probably had some of the worst execution ever-- a wasted opportunity to have the show really leave an impact.\\n\\n\r\nUmineko is not a good show, and it is most certainly not well done. It is however amusing, though I'd imagine fans would have wanted more. I'd say time was well spent watching it. But it could have been just so much more.\\n",

Not that I actually like random anime, but this is one awesome random anime.\r\nAnime revolves around 18 people gets brutally murdered in all different ways. I'm sure you know the rest of the info....So...\r\nLets get straight to the review, shall we?\r\nStory- Story is.....Kinda difficult to explain. What is the Genre of this anime? hmmm...Is it Mystery? Hell yeah. Is it Horror? Well, quite. Is it Romance? Sometimes. Is it Comedy? Definitely. Then what kind of anime is it? All of the above. MysteryHorroRomanComedy. Yup, the anime was so random thetype of anime also became so random. The anime follows Higurashi style, you know where everyone becomes alive the following episode just after being killed in the previous episode. Yes, that kind. If you played the game Phoenix Wright:Ace Attorney for the DS, then this anime is the same. The protagonist, Ushiromiya Battler is the cocky but cool dude who doesnt believe that witches exist. While, a witch named Beatrice challenges him in game to make him believe that Witches and Magic exist. Thats the story. Mainly focused on Battler trying to talk his way that witches don't exist, even when they actually did. As the story progresses, it becomes more and more random which is why many people didn't liked this anime.\\n\r\nStory= 6 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nArt- Art/animation/graphics whatever is great. Well, Its kinda obvious since this is made in 2009! Art= 8 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nSound- Despite having a weird OP and strange ED left me to \"fast-forwarding\" it. Voice-acting? Awesome. Everything here was good, only the OP and the ED were the flaws. I didn't liked the OP and ED. Sound= 7 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-  Loved the characters, especially the 7 Stakes of Purgatory and Siestas. I REALLY LOVED THEM. Who wouldn't want them in the anime?. Well, Character designs was definitely over-the-top. Character= 9 out of 10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- Most of the enjoyment came from the randomness, well for me. The Uber-randomness made the anime hilarious. It even was funny when it wasn't supposed to funny. Did I mention the anime is very violent? Yeah, probably more bloodier and gorier than Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni. But the violence didn't even satisfy me one bit. The randomness is even better. Some parts of the anime was very dumb and pointless though not to mention very random which is why this anime can also be included in the Comedy genre. Hilarious even when aren't. Enjoyment= 7 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- I personally enjoyed Higurashi a LOT more than Umineko, but Umineko is still pretty good. I won't recommend it to everyone, despite its uber-randomness. But Why an 8 for this anime? Without the 7 sisters of Purgatory, this anime would receive a 6 out of ten. This anime has mixed opinions. No matter what kind of genre you hate or like, I would give you one advice= Just watch this anime. Who knows? You might actually end up loving it just like I did.\\n\r\nOVERALL= 8 out of 10.",

Thats the reason That I began to watch Umineko.\r\nThe beginning was simple: some mysterious murders are been commieted an the killer is a misterious person. A peerson is killing the Ushiromiya family? Maria, the youngest one of the Ushiromiya believes in Beatrice, the Golden Witch.\r\nI really like the story: Battler vs Beatrice. The game between this two characters is lke a chess game and Battler wants to win: He believes that no magic was used to kill his family. Beatrice will demostrate Battler her power.\r\nAll characters well excellent:a great personality. I really like the participation of Ange, Eva Maria and Virgilia in the game. Maybe the anime only focus on the witches and battler. But are moments in you can say: What did he/she did that?\\n\\n\r\nThe art was good, acceptable, not a great art, not the worst but the animation has a lot of mistakes, but  to me it doesnt matter. All things (in this case the animation) can have mistakes. I Ignore them. Yes, there are a lot of obvious mistakes. You have to ignore them to finish the anime.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoy the anime, but in some pats I got bored. The songs and clips of the opening and ending are so good. I like the changings of the secuense of mages in the opening: little changes like the picture of Beato, for example. This changes change in each game.\\n\\n\r\nIn Overall I gave an 8. The end of story wasnt good: I really want to see battler and Ange together, this doesn't happen. The final of the anime wast great. Acceptable. I was waiting for a best ending.\\n\\n\r\nNote: Before this I didnt see Higurashi, but in the furutre I will see it. So I cant compare Higurashi vs umineki",

In the letter Beatrice tells them that if they do not solve the epitaph they will all die. \\n\\n\r\nThe story starts off interesting and catches Ur attention right from the beginning. It has the same confusing effect just like higurashi. It also keeps repeating what happened in the first chapter but its slightly different, just like in higurshi. I wonder what kind of ending Umineko will have.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I must say that I didn't really like the art. eventho in higurashi sometimes U can bearly see the characters' noses in Umineko they focused so much on the details that e became creepy. Especially when Maria makes her laugh and they make a close-up on her face. \\n\\n\r\nSound: nothing that I can really point out.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: U mostly follow Battler but overall U don't get 2 knw much about the characters yet. In episode 1 he introduces the other characters and what kind of relationship he has with them but U don't get any background information about them. Atleast not yet (so far episode 8 is out). \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: So far I've been having the same feelings I had when I was watching Higurashi. U have no idea what's going on and its a bit confusing. Only at the very end do U understand what has been going on. I like this because U keep questioning everything and keep trying 2 solve gthe mystery by yourself, only 2 get all ur guesses wrong as U keep going further in the serie.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Recently I rewatched this anime, I was a big fan of higurashi and felt umineko was the weaker of the two. After finishing I was bored and found umineko chiru the sound novel containing episodes 5-8 (anime shows 1-4). After playing all 8 games now I really appreciate umineko as an amazing game but I don't think it translated well to anime\r\nStory: 3\r\nThe problem with the story is its rushed but on a level that its so fast a lot of the subtleties are lost. It's just a mess by the end of episode 26 I was the one asking to be killed. There arealso lots of moments that are amazing in the SN but disappointing in the anime, like when Virgillia opens her eye in chapter 3 which is left out or Kyrie and Rudolph fighting the seven sisters. I think the fact that Ryukushi leaves the mysteries to be interpreted and solved by the viewer doesn't work well with the anime setting especially since a lot of the clues are left out of briefly covered. Overall feels very weak and confusing\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nI'm a big fan of the art in the anime, from the characters to the gorey scenes. Maybe it looks a bit too anime with the DisneyTM eyes but hey I'm a sucker for that kinda thing\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThis is my favorite part of the anime, the great soundtrack from the creepy opening to that menacing ending sound track is strong. The music throughout sounds amazing and I think it really is a work of art to be appreciated.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3\\n\r\nThis is what breaks the anime, you get into episode 1 and all of a sudden who the f are these characters? Until I saw them next to eachother I thought rosa and Eva were the same person\u2026 and how would you describe them? Eva: evil Rosa: bad parent Maria: Creepy Kinzo: will he ever shut up??? In the SN when we're introduced to Eva shes a sarcastic but funny aunt to Battler. Rosa seems to be a kindhearted loving individual, Maria starts of as very cute and friendly. And Kinzo\u2026 well he's the same. Anyway they needed to atleast get this much out of the way before having the characters we know nothing about getting brutally murdered. Battler and Beato's characters have been dumbed down too but that's okay maybe more time will be spent on the stor.. Oh wait\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\r\nBoth times when I watch t it's been a ok experience and I get to the end and its kinda like wat did I just do. If you want some mindless horror with a bit of suspence it's not a bad anime. But if you came from the mystery and were disappointed to find no conclusion I suggest playing Chiru (ep5-8)\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI won't accept a mystery without a heart - Willard H Wright. Probably one of the best quotes from the SN and repeated throughout Ironically is the one thing missing. We have a bunch of pretty people with some nice music in the background but I feel like it has no heart\u2026 if only the characters had been deeper or the story better presented\\n",

            "content": "As you may already know, this series is an alternative setting to When They Cry Higurashi, except this series has a lot of magic used in it, so let's continue.\r\nThe synopsis is pretty much a brief description of the first chapter of a bigger underlying story, and mind you this series can be separated into four chapters with at least 4 episodes each. The anime is centered around a game played by the Witch Beatrice and Battler (a member of the Ushiromiya family) and the goal of the game is to have Battler either admit that witches exist, or prove how the murders of eachchapter can be done by human intervention.\\n\\n\r\nYou will be first introduced to this game setting about 4 episodes in.\\n\\n\r\nI thought this series was good, however, I often found myself getting bored and confused. Because of the magic aspect, I sometimes had a hard time following the story, but that doesn't mean there isn't some awesomely insane sequences.\\n\\n\r\nThere was tons of blood and gore and dead bodies everywhere, however, the gore was often censored. There is a deep psychological aspect to this story that shows up near the end of the series, but what I liked the most, is how the show depicts how devious the witch Beatrice can be. Sometimes the story would completely mislead you, until you found out at the very end that they were pulling your leg the entire time, making me feel stupid, yet impressed. But what I was most impressed about is how the artists depicted the family members and how they would act in order to receive unimaginable wealth. In 2009 the Ushiromiya families 10 tons of gold would be worth 20 billion yen, in 2011, the gold would be worth 40 billion yen, I would probably be an uptight douche bag too if I could get wealth like that.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was very consistent and at times down right creepy, however, since a lot of the gore was censored, I didn't get to see the full glory of the horrifying scenes. And even though magic was used throughout, the art was consistent during those sequences. And for some reason, Victorian dresses can still look frilly and extremely complex... I wonder if that is just a natural thing for anime's.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, the dialogue sometimes moves to quickly and at times too slow. A lot of the time the dialogue is to help you understand the setting of the current chapter, but it is also used to create character development. Music.... what music, I guess I was too bored or possibly too engaged to notice the music.\\n\\n\r\nLike I said, I did enjoy the series, yet found myself getting bored sometimes. The story at times would really just drag along and when you see the same setting multiple times, things tend to get boring until you come across the one aspect or part of the story that changes everything forcing the story to go down a horrifying path.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give this alternative setting a 7/10. I think the show was good, and if I had seen the show when I would be more engaged, perhaps it would've received a better score by me.\\n\\n\r\nAnd mind you, Einzo did not resurrect Beatrice, but rather, Beatrice uses the epitaph as a reason to continuously murder the Ushiromiya family. If I got anything wrong, it may be because some of these things may have been explained in those times I was bored.",

            "content": "The Synopsis doesn't really help much so just a heads up it's 4 episodes with roughly 5 eps each covering each episode ( so it's like 4 \"games\" covered ). Knowing this I can start the review. \r\nDoes magic exist? You won't even know anyway from watching this.\r\nThis is what I would call the Demo edition of Umineko; You don't need to spend money ( not much if you getting it legally ) and you don't even need to spend 100+ hours on it. This is what you get for how little effort you decide to put into it; an unfinished/resolved mystery with plot pointsthat make 0 sense, very little character development and mediocre fight scenes.\\n\\n\r\nStory: The idea of the story is interesting however the anime executes this rather poorly. When I was watching this I felt like it was like splicing \" clips \", kind of like if you imagined making a show but remove all the \"unnecessary \" bits, you just get a show that jumps quickly to the next scene without any transitioning and some moments they skip so far that what they mention has you confused as to how, when and why they even got there. \\n\\n\r\nAnother issue is with Battlers reasoning's, the point of the show focuses on the battle between Beatrice who is trying to convince Battler that witches/magic exists ( which she call it \"surrendering\" ) vs Battler who is using rather stupid outrageous reasons to deny the existence of this. Battler's meant to sound smart but since the story is limited, Battler comes out as being an absolute idiot who can just say something like \" oh they ate tiny bombs and that's how their stomachs were destroyed \" and the witch can only just laugh at it and accept it without arguing back. You get the point. \\n\\n\r\nArt: The arts alright, it looks like there's a light glare constantly shone on the screen which can get rather annoying but it's not too bad. Most the efforts on the gore and some of the magic flash shows.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Sounds literally the only good part of the anime, it's not as loud and High quality as the VNs tracks but the tracks are good. As every person ever who has heard the Opening, it's impossible to skip that amazing opening, can't get sick of hearing it for 25eps straight. Oh, the voices are alright too.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Lack of character development is a big issue in this, really the only ones who get decent development is  Maria, heck the MC Battler and Beatrice actually barely got any development. Every other character probably got like the basic background knowledge and that's it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I'll be perfectly honest, I only went through those 26eps only cause I have read the VN and was interested in seeing what its like animated. That's basically the only thing that kept my enjoyment there.\\n\r\nOutside VN experience i'd say ep 1 and 2 are the hardest to endure, ep 3 and 4 does pick up the enjoyment a little... ehh if you into Battler/Beatrices rivalry. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: It's straight up a bad adaptation, you basically just watch this than if you curious you will go to Manga/VN for further information. This only covers half of Umineko so yes you will feel bad after watching this and either crave for more or just give up. After all this is what you get for not spending the effort in reading 100+ hours of text.\\n",

In the beggining it was great their was so much suspence and thriller it had me hooked but once the mystery was solved( or so we thought) it got kind of boring....kinda pulling your leg for no reason or should I say \"beating a dead horse\".",

The story itself is so confusing and illogical, lets say higurashi no naku koro ni S1 is also confusing, that i assume its just some random vilage with random killing in a 4 different arcs and no plots at all. and iwas wrong. But umineko, they show that this was a game about battler and magic existence which he rejects. I mean come on batler. Even the game itself is a magic, how the hell do you see your faimily getting killed again and again, and you still dont believe magic? its like he is just some spoiled brat who's contradicting himself, there is no magic, but the culprit is not someone he knows. i was like, WTF batler, wake up already. But okay, i think i know how he feels, he is like in a deep sadness so he wants to prove that even that kind of crime can be done without magic. i was expecting some detective-like explanation from him. but i was wrong. all he did was shouting random theory with no sense of logic at all. even until the end. i think im gonna cry at this point, i watched 26 episode and i still dont understand why is this beatrice's thing happens in the first place, what happen 6 years ago? who is batler's mother? why kanon has that blade thing in his arm? omg y u do diz...\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS. characters too many, i dont even want to remember all of them. and all of them are useless\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT. i am more pissed",

            "content": "One word to describe Umineko: Unfocused.\r\n\"Inconsistent\" might be another appropriate adjective for this massive disappointment. It lacks any kind of direction in every possible aspect.\r\nThere are numerous themes constantly fighting for center stage, every single one of them lacking the subtlety and thought necessary for such an ambitious endeavor to work. It's like watching a toddler try to jam together the pieces of five different puzzles. For one arc, the focus is entirely placed on ideas of greed and money's control over people. Yet another arc tries to explore how pain in one person breeds their cruelty to others. Umineko is incapable of choosing amain theme and it results in a big pile of half-baked philosophies that don't fit together as seamlessly as they should.\\n\\n\r\nThere are far too many characters, many of whom are wildly inconsistent in their characterization. This is a huge problem with the main villain, Beatrice, who will go from cruel witch to wise woman at the drop of a hat, with no explanation whatsoever. A great majority of the cast just feels like props to be killed again and again, with no heart. Once again, we see a problem with all of these characters battling for narrative control, each one sharing their motives and sob stories and such, only to be thrown aside again once it's time for somebody else's turn in the spotlight. It doesn't help that half of these characters are downright irritating, without a single redeeming trait. \\n\\n\r\nThe last bit of icing on the inconsistency cake comes with the tone of the show. It's no secret that it's supposed to be a Gothic psychological horror, but certain details completely detract from whatever atmosphere Umineko has going for it. For instance, there is a scene that is supposed to be rather gruesome, where one character repeatedly kills two other characters in a variety of different ways. At one point, she decides to kill them by... crushing them with a giant cake! After seeing so many brutal murders and feeling genuinely immersed in the manic breakdown, this one silly insert feels out of place and takes you out of the moment. So many stupid, silly, anime-cliche things are thrown in out of the blue. Some other offenders are three magical sniper girls with animal ears and a lion-boy-ghost that makes a mockery of the relatively serious plot point that he is associated with.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as animation goes, Umineko isn't quite as bad as Higurashi but it's still  ugly to look at. Even some of the character designs are ugly, if not utterly ridiculous. The music is decent - the opening song is absolutely gorgeous and probably one of the best things about this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending is just plain awful. The one main story line isn't even resolved! In fact, absolutely nothing is resolved! We're given plenty of answers for questions we never even asked, while our actual questions are just ignored, as if entire scenes didn't even happen. I was debating on how I felt on Umineko while watching it, but the ending solidified my negative opinions toward it.\\n\\n\r\nDon't get me wrong; Umineko is not a hundred percent terrible. The logic games between Beatrice and Battler make for solid entertainment, and when the tone of the show is not being screwed up, it actually nails the isolated, Gothic atmosphere. The magic in this universe is quite fascinating, if not confusing. Some arcs are better than others: they range from brilliant to absolutely stupid and everywhere in between.\\n\\n\r\n All in all, it's not something I would recommend. Being from the same writer and director as Higurashi, I figured Umineko would be a story of similar caliber. Sadly, it is not even close. Don't waste your time unless you really feel the need to watch everything in the naku koro ni universe.",

            "content": "The only the way to watch this show is to watch it with a friend, one who you can enjoy suffering with. This is a trial that can only be completed by those with iron resolve, or really bad taste. Each arc felt like a different anime and the characters and motivations were so under explained that it felt like a different anime every arc. I came into this expecting a murder mystery, I got...a comedy? I still don't know. In the end this anime got me to want to buy the game so ten atta ten. \r\nStory: The story left a lot to bedesired, it was all over the place and went nowhere. Don't expect a decent ending either because everything just follows the status quo. Battler trying to explain events made it feel like the show was trying hard to be serious but came off as comedic because of how bad it was.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art all in all really wasn't that bad, sure there were a few times where the animation looked derpy, but it looked okay most of the time. The faces were great, being a \"sequel\" to Higurashi you can expect to see some great ones. The gore was also better than I would have thought.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Music was pretty great, and so were most of the sound effects. The 7 Stakes of Purgatory made the stupidest sound as they traveled through the air though. The most annoying of the characters named Maria will constantly be making an uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu sound, so be prepared for that, there is a compilation of most of the times she says it in the first episode and it spans 2 minutes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: I almost don't even want to touch this, but here we go. Battler is an idiot and our main protagonist, his purpose is to deny the existence of witches and magic as he plays a game with one, while being helped by one, while existing in a separate dimension viewing a timeline of alternate realities. Maria is the most annoying 9 year old who is constantly getting beaten by her mother Rosa. Maria makes up for it by having the most character development and delivering the best scene in the anime. Beatrice is an insane witch who uses magic. No one else really matters because they barely get development until the end, which would be spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I'm sadistic\\n",

Although the plot my be a bit confusing at times and the MC's constant emotion dilemma may cause you to consider dropping the anime I'll advise you not to. The other animes created by the same production may not be all that appealing but I can tell you right now this anime is. It has got nice artwork that can be considered one of the top when looking at the competition and the other animes released at the time. The storyline could do with some more work but I can honestly saythat it gave me thrills and moment that I burst with excitement as the MC enters badass mode with the long awaited catch phrase \"no good at all\" that most mystery animes are missing and most genres of animes are lacking lately.\\n\r\nWarning there are some gory death scenes and the such so I'll tell you now if you don't like watching people die repeatedly or can't handle the stuff this animes is not for you as it is the same people die over and over again.\\n\r\nAll in all this animes is (overall) really good and I think it would be for your benefit to watch it.",

However was that wait really needed and animated well at least some of it.\r\nStory:\r\nBe ready to had some what happened that scene and that time in this anime many time. Also this anime has a lot of story twists so after watching episode it can change dramatically when you watch another one. Story is dark and it willeasily keep viewer having new information all the time. This is also story that let's you think how it's going to go and why did that and those events happened. This is basically story that some guy is want to believe that there is no supernatural events happening and then there is other side who wants to get that guy to believe that supernatural things exist.\\n\\n\r\nStory is great and enjoyable at least some parts of it. so right grade is 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAnimation / Art: \\n\\n\r\nRokkunjima looks really frightening and scary place that will make any viewer to have goosebumps at some point when watching this anime. Environment is not all the time same which is good we get to see many themed environments in this anime. Some of animated scenes are censored because this is actually quite brutal and gory anime.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation / Art is OK if you don't pay much attention to those censored scenes. So it will be given 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe Music:\\n\\n\r\nThe best this anime can really give viewer is a big music collection. OP is really sad and make some emotional feelings to viewer also ED theme is a little scary and sad too. But I liked both in the end.\\n\\n\r\nMusic is definitely big trump card for this anime. Because every tune is different and somehow related to this anime. I will give 10 /10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThis series had a lot of different characters but sadly all of them didn't got developed in the end. However most of these characters have their own painful stories to tell and anime really wants to viewer to understand logic behind these.\\n\\n\r\nI believe right grade for characters is 9/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nStill I enjoyed this anime and that will tell my episodes. Like I watched 10 episodes per day. So I was really caught up on it.\\n\\n\r\nMy Enjoyment points are 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nUmineko isn't perfect anime series it lacks certain characters developments but it can make you really feel the characters pain they going through in the anime. But let me say this after watching this anime you don't now all the answers for riddles that you should because Studio DEEN couldn't finished it properly and that's why many people will encourage to read VN (Visual Novel) if you want to now how the story is going to continue. I should read it also because I haven't read it yet.\\n\\n\r\nMy Overall and final score this anime is 9/10",

The mystery, the murders, the slightly psychological play, the strange characters and the parts of it that you're just not meant to understand completely.\r\nWhile watching the first segment of the anime, I was absolutely amazed. In fact, I couldn't stop watching at all. Maria, the absolutely strangest child I've seen in anime, is such an interesting character from the very moment she appears. Another thing that adds spice to the story.\r\nI have a hard time writing this without spoiling. Let's say that the first segmentof it, the first \"game\", was very exciting and interesting, but when I realized what the coming segments would be containing, I felt myself slightly disappointed. Now it was no longer a secret, and not as confusing. However, when Battler and Beatrice start their own game, it becomes interesting again.\\n\\n\r\nI can't think of anything certain that I didn't like about it - perhaps the repetitiveness, yet that is part of the point. At first it seems slightly annoying, but when you come to the later episodes, after ~15, you realize that the repetitiveness is for a reason.\\n\\n\r\nA short and brief review perhaps, but maybe it will be helpful to someone? There have to be more people than me that want to watch a mystery anime of which you don't completely apprehend all of. Or maybe it's just me being stupid?

Yes I do think the anime is less good.\r\nNote: less good, not awful.\r\nHaving watched Ryukishi07's previous series, Higurashi, I started watching Umineko with high expectations... and it met them, kinda. Not the whole way, not by any means, but while watching it, I experienced one of my favourite feelings while watching a show: a desire to watch it all, and understand everything.\r\nUnfortunately, it does fall short on the explaining part, and by 'fall short' I mean doesn't make anything clear. Again, drawing a comparison to the VN, the novel explained everything thatneeded explaining, leaving you to work out the rest as you saw fit. After watching the anime, you're left wondering 'So this guy is trying to disprove witches... by arguing with a witch?'\\n\\n\r\nIt was an enjoyable ride, but afterwards, you were left wondering what the hell just happened.\\n\\n\r\nAnother problem was that the anime tried to squeeze the plot of a vn which takes several hours per story arc to read, into about 10 hours. Unfortunately, this means a lot is missing, and I mean a lot.\\n\\n\r\nIn and of itself, the anime a decent, a good watch, and worth spending the time watching... but you could spend that time reading the first story arc in its original format, and be far better rewarded. Given it's necessary restrictions, it's not bad, could have been better, but did all right.\\n\\n\r\nBut I, as many fans, feel sad at the thought of what it could have been.",

This is my first review, so I hope it's not too horrible. \r\nStory: In all honesty, I'm mixed about the story; I feel something is lacking. I hope they come out with a season 2 for this, cause they left us with a cliffhanger basically.\r\nArt: I thought the characters had some nice designs. I thought it fit for the year this is set in. People have stated that the animation is ugly, which is apparently a problem that the animationcompany has. I saw no problems with the animation.  \\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound was ok. I love the opening theme for this anime. It fits very well for an anime like this. But I did not like the ending theme, and worse, they showed episode previews while the song was playing, and I just couldn't take that, so I skipped them.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Unlike Higurashi, none of these characters are likeable to me. Some are pointless, and some are so underdeveloped, it's as if they were there simply to die. Battler is unwilling to accept that witches exist, even when it's all sitting right in front of him.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I enjoyed Umineko, but I began to grow bored of it toward the end for some reason. Maybe the thing that was lacking prevented me from finding true enjoyment while watching this anime. I don't detest this anime, but it's far from perfect. If they do make a second a season, let's hope it fixes the problems it has.",

            "content": "Starting out, I did not have very high expectations for this series.  There seems to be a general consensus among Umineko fans (and 07th Expansion fans in general) that the Umineko no Naku Koro ni anime is an unpalatable bastardization of the original visual/sound novel format.  Not having played through the novels myself, I can't say if that's true or not, but I can say that I was pleasantly surprised by this series.\r\nThe Umineko no Naku Koro ni anime (hereafter just \"Umineko\") does a couple of things very well.  The premise itself is a classic \"And Then There Were None\" motif witha supernatural twist that is mostly a welcome addition.  The pacing is quite good; there is just enough action to keep things moving, and generally the dialogue doesn't bog the show down.  The soundtrack contributes greatly to the tension and suspense, and the allover mysterious atmosphere of the show and a number of the characters (particularly the witches) makes it easy to stay interested.  If you're watching for the first time, you will definitely be curious to see what happens next, provided you can stomach the violence.  (This series definitely holds one, if not several, contenders for the title of Anime's Craziest Death.)\\n\\n\r\nThe vast majority of the characters are little more than character designs with names; they have simple motives (love, money, power), and simple connections to one another (family, lovers, etc.).  I'm generally really turned-off by flat characters, but this works for Umineko as most of the people on Rokkenjima (as well as the witches' \"furniture\") are basically pawns on a chessboard.  It's the game being played that is important, not the pieces on the board.  \\n\\n\r\nThe first three \"episodes\" (which are more like mini-arcs but are perhaps better thought of as rounds in a game) are fairly well put together and enticing.  This creates a non-linear story line, which was simultaneously intriguing and frustrating.  It adds multiple dimensions to the plot, offering alternative scenarios and sometimes exposing questionable motives or allegiances (again, this is definitely true of the witches, but also of Kinzo, Eva and Rosa).  On the other hand, multiple outcomes obscure the truth, which is part of the point, but makes for a sometimes irritating viewing experience.  \\n\\n\r\nThings start to fall apart during the final round, though, as the story diverts in a new direction.  Without revealing any spoilers, I'll say that a number of new characters are inserted in the final few episodes, right as the climax begins to build, and diverts the story away from Battler's struggle with Beatrice and the murders occurring on Rokkenjima.  As a result, there is very little worthwhile buildup to the final confrontation, which ended up being immensely anti-climactic.  These episodes seem to bear the message that magic is what you make of it, but this is extremely muddled with the utter confusion created by the new characters and their interactions.  Aside from offering some redemption for Maria, the final round of the game felt woefully incomplete to me, and be warned, the ending is far from conclusive or satisfying.  \\n\\n\r\nIn short, I liked this series for its intriguing premise and found it thought-provoking and interesting.  I did not like the mess of loose plot ends left at the conclusion and the confusing and arguably pointless side quest during the final act.  If you are looking for a series with soulful characters, an unambiguous plot with a clear delineation between good and evil, a conclusive outcome, and little to no gruesome deaths or violence, I'd suggest you pass on this.  Despite this, I certainly don't feel that this series is guilty of being the pernicious garbage I'd come to expect from its reputation.  Umineko will never end up on my list of favorites, but I'm glad I gave it a shot.",

Are they both right? Or is one completely wrong.\r\nIt is a mind anime to me. I payed a lot of attention, remembering little details from everywhere. It made much more sense when you pay attention and think yourself.\r\nBeatrice tells Battler that only stuff she did is possible by magic.Battler tries to disprove her theory. Maria, the 9 year old girl who idolizes Beatrice, gets frustrated at her family who wave off Beatrice as a figment of her imagination. \\n\r\nLike I said, it makes you think. Who's dead? Who's alive? \\n\r\nThe characters are based off the Higurashi characters a little but the story line and characters couldn't be more different. \\n\r\nUmineko is not a follow-up to Higurashi, it is a different anime all together. It is as gorey, if not more, than Higurashi but it is a fantastic anime.\\n\r\nPeople who are unable to follow it have not payed a lot of attention. Before starting this anime, I knew I had to pay a lot of attention. I hung onto every word each character said instead of just listening to what happens. \\n\r\nI adored this anime for the reasons it made me think, a very good story line and the art work is fantastic.\\n\r\nNot many people will agree with what I said, but I think this anime is fantastic.",

            "content": "I will attempt to write this review basing it on my experience as an anime fan, being as objective as possible. I will also voice out my opinion at the end of this review wich I will keep short.I have not read the novel and my review will not include any comparissons between the two.\r\n(Story 6/10)\r\n There has been a lot of strife between those who have watched solely the anime and those who have read the novel and also watche the anime version of it. Always arguing about the story (for the most part).\r\n So the story is basically about the Ushiromiya familly whichis so very wealthy coming to their private island were the head of the familly lives to discuss the inheritance. However on their first day there the head of the familly (Ushiromiya Kinzo) is found murdered. As they suspect eachother about the murder there are even more unexplainable murders happening.\\n\r\n  So here comes the main male character Ushiromiya Battler (or Buttler to some) trying to explain the murders when the witch named Beatrice arrives and says that she killed them with magic. So to sum up they end up in a deadly game of wits, in which Battler tries to prove that the murders were commited by human means and Beatrice tries to make him admit that they were commited by using magic. If Battler wins they can all return safely however if Beatrice wins they will all die.\\n\\n\r\nTo the point now, as a plot it had a lot of potential and it also sounds awesome, right? However there are major flaws and unexplained phenomena and certain cliffhangers that could have made the anime a whole lot better if corrected. As you can imagine there are a lot of murder scenes and that includes a lot of gore. Unfortunately the camera focuses more on the deaths than on the reaction of the witnesses (or those who found the bodies). Even though I said that I enjoyed the plot although I certainly wouldn't mind if they had paid more attention to it.\\n\\n\r\n(Art 7/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe art is pretty amazing. There are some faults at certain scenes but that's about it. The characers look cool and all that.. However all or if not all then most of the female characters have a huge cleavage which kinda runs it because although they look good and all it means there is fanservice, which kinda ruins the whole mystery-horror-psychological atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\n(Sound 8/10)\\n\\n\r\nThere are some very very nice songs and themes in it and the only reason that the anime doesn't get a 10 rating from the sound aspect is that the music is often misplaced. Many good themes are placed at the wrong time and vise versa.\\n\\n\r\n(Character 6/10)\\n\\n\r\nBattler Ushiromiya: A young boy whose mother is (or was) a detective and is the main male protagonist of the story. He's passionate good-natured and cares a lot for others. He's also calm and is able to think rationally under pressure.\\n\\n\r\nBeatrice: The main female antagonist of the story. She is the witch that killed everyone and decides to play a game with Battler out of boredom with everyone's lives being at stake. She is mostly cruel, ruthless and also both seductive and confident. She hates losing and will do anything in order to win.\\n\\n\r\nMany say there are more protagonists than Battler and Beatrice but those are the main two for me.\\n\r\nAlthough the characters start out nicely, they have a sudden change of hearts especially during the last few episodes. Even more of them Beatrice.\\n\\n\r\n(Enjoyment7/10)\\n\\n\r\nEven though there are major flaws and cliffhangers I certainly enjoyed the anime and it encouraged me to read the novel. Many people will say otherwise but do not be influenced too much..\\n\\n\r\n(Overall 7/10)\\n\\n\r\nYou may find it lacking in certain sections and it is a good anime to watch if you're not a detail freak. If you're a begginer in watching anime you will enjoy this even more than I did. Then again it is a double-edged sword. If you've seen plenty of other series you'll start to notice flaws that may not even be that big of a deal.",

I expected to see a good detective story with the interesting puzzles and solutions, and what have I got? There is no logic in battle between Butler and Beatrice. Ho many times he had solved Beatrice's puzzles? almost not once untill the last episode, and even then his solution was too suddenly. He just told her about every puzzlein every world, but he didnt share any of his thoughts with the viewer. It looks like the authors didnt wanted to think, HOW could the main hero solve this puzzles, they just told him the solution. And all the rest time we can see only his mood swings between \"ok, Beatrice, give me some more time and i'll beat ya\" and \"I have ruined everythig\" and this repeats for several times. \\n\r\n  I was rather close to drop this anime, and I only watched it to see the last episode, but even it worth not seeing. \\n",

            "content": "Umineko is one of those series that really makes you think. Though the ending was kind of annoying, I found that it did offer up some good plot and story when it came to the main portion of the story.\r\nStarting off with the bad. Umineko didn't really end, it left with an uncomplete ending that ends halfway through the game series. This makes less sense then it would have for Higurashi, Ryukishi07's other famous work, because Umineko is more straight forward than Higurashi was as a game series. I have to say that that's where the story was lacking, other than that, it was avery good adaptation of the original Umineko game franchise up until the 4th game.\\n\\n\r\nThe good things do far out number the bad things though. When it comes to character development, you have all these family members that are all wanting control over the family's inheritance and mansion. A couple are in it for financial gain, one of them wants to gain the acceptance of her father, and the other just wants to screw over the rest of the family. When it comes down to actual character development, the series takes on the development of Rosa and Eva as two very close sisters, but at the same time hating each other. This is all without spoiling anything in the series, I can promise you that. Then you have the Youth in the family who just want their parents to get along and stop fighting over the inheritance. Later on you even get character development for characters that were really only supporting characters for the first part of the series. Moving on to the story, I wouldn't expect less from Ryukishi07, he really takes certain times to blow your mind in this series and create characters that you can just despise while telling a story, the story was awesome. I love Ryukishi's art style in anime so that was a highlight for me and the soundtrack was just amazing. I have to say that I really enjoyed watching this series.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict:\\n\r\nYou should give it a chance and don't let the ending bother you too much.",

If you watch anime for the sake of its art, just to enjoy the drawings, then you may like this anime. Oh, and if you're not of this kinds and have watched animes such as 'Death Note', 'Code Geass' and others and enjoyed their 'chess-match like' structure of the story, then you might be able to get through this anime. But then again, if you're not of any of this kinds, you MUST NOT watch this anime. Why, would you ask. Well, because of thefollowing reasons:\\n\\n\r\n- Regarding the story, it's so goddamned repetitive. And, in my personal opinion, it doesn't even deliver a suitable end.\\n\r\n- In terms of art is quite good, as well as in terms of sound, but then again: that constitutes no reason to go through 26 episodes. Of any kind of story.\\n\r\n- The characters are shallow. So fucking shallow and superficial. There isn't ONE only fucking character who's to be thought of as one with some depth: Beatorice's the only one you can provide some of this attribute and that's because she's meant to be a mistery to the other characters, though only at first.\\n\r\n- The overcoming enjoyment out of all of this is merely 'fair' (like the number 6 claims), and that's because I enjoy such an structure as the one I've mentioned before.\\n\\n\r\nTherefore, I do not recommend this anime at all. If you're wondering whether to start this anime or any other, just get this one out of your options. It's just not worth it.",

For those of you guys who are still confused about the story, you are not alone and i may summarized it a bit better(spoilers). I have not read any light novel and just watched the anime so I am not so bookworm biased on this.\r\nMy summary(SPOILER BUT ITS WORTH UNDERSTANDING):\r\nThe setting takes place at an isolated island where the whole family meets up from such a rare occasion in the years that they were apart. The grandfather was known to be the wealthiest man because he held a contract with thewitch by the name of Beatrice. \\n\\n\r\nThe grandfather was mad with black magic and sorcery that there was rumors that Beatrice may had been his dead mistress, her soul was caged on the island from his greed, she was inherited the power of the witch from the previous witch, she is not a real witch at all, she immortal and was human before, and so on. ???\\n\\n\r\nThe adults of the family wanted to inherit the gold from the grandpa and so the game begins where anyone within the 18(x) people on the island can win to claim the hidden gold. but at the cost of unknown sacrifices made by the witch herself or some other factor\\n\\n\r\nSequence of mysterious death appear according to the witch's foretelling letter. If all members of the household acknowledge the witch's existence, then its game over and the eternal witch wins. If anyone can solve the riddle of the mysterious death, its their win. if they found the hidden gold, they can be a witch and golden land(idk). \\n\\n\r\nTHEREFORE BATTLER AND BEATRICE BATTLE OUT TO OUTWIT EACH OTHER FROM REALITY VS MAGIC! MULTIPLE PARALLEL SCENARIOS OCCUR FROM  MYSTERIOUS DEATHS AND THEY MUST BE DISPROVED! AND ALSO, BATTLER'S SISTER APPEARED IN THE STORY. ITS JUST HER STORY FROM THE TIMELINE THAT OCCUR WHEN NO ONE FROM THE ISLAND CAME BACK HOME.",

The VN MAY solve some of the issues i found on the Anime, but that doesn't rly concerns me, or whoever is gonna watch the anime alone.\r\n2. I watched up till episode 12. Then i decided i could use my time doing something better, so i don't know how it ends, but honestly...after what i've seen, i rly don't care about it.\r\nThe whole story is based on the battle between Beatrice and Battler. She wants him to admit she used magic tocommit the murders, he denies that, saying there must be a non-magical explanation to that.\\n\\n\r\nHere we find the MAIN issue with this Anime. After the first 4-5 episodes, where everything proceeds smoothly, the battle/game starts.\\n\\n\r\nWe find Battler yelling \"Magic doesn't exist\", \"I will neevr admit the existence of witches\". But still, he is dead, he is in a different dimension, he and the witch can disappear in golden butterflies...but Magic doesn't exist....OK, we can say that he is focusing only on whats happening on the island, where people die WITHOUT the help of Magic.\\n\\n\r\nBut this is the point i stopped watching this thing. Beatrice starts summoning Demons, Goat-Headed butlers. Shannon and Kanon start to use superpowers to fight these demons. And in the end....these demons transform themselves into knives and kill the residents of the Island.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is the point of this Anime? The main guy keep saying magic doesn't exist, and the Murders are done by Humans, not magic......but HEY, some of the murders are done by Demons, summoned by Magic, after a Magical/Superpowered battle....so what the hell is the point of the Anime?\\n\\n\r\nDO i have to keep watching the Main character saying magic doesn't exist, when the scene before we see demons fighting Superpowered Humans?...cmon\\n\\n\r\nI could also talk about how the little girl start using psycho expressions since episode 1, making you wonder why no-one seems to care/notice a psychopathic 9yo when people start getting murdered.\\n\r\nHow some characters die as Humans in a world, and reveal themselves as powerful immortal beings in the next...meaning an immortal witch was killed only to be brought back alive....\\n\\n\r\nThis Anime, makes NO SENSE. It is not a Magic/Spernatural anime. It is NOT a mystery anime, since you cannot solve a mystery that doesn't make sense....i see people killed by magic but i must explain how they were NOT killed by magic....and with this i'm done.",

I was excited to see When The Seagulls Cry as well, but it ended up being a little frustrating to watch. \r\nThe time loop format of both shows make things complicated enough on their own, but When The Cicadas Cry kept the story itself simple. The characters were just trying to make it through the loop without dying. Seagulls, on the other hand has plenty of things that make the story morecomplex than it needed to be. Battler and Beatrice (the two leads) are in a battle of wits to determine if the mass murder of the loop they are in could only have been accomplished by a witch. This sounds simple, but the list of loose ends and questions involving the premise is staggering. They don't explain much at all. \\n\r\nEven so, the actual game between Battler and Beatrice is very interesting to watch. If that had been what the show was, it would have been much better. The problem is that things keep getting in the way of the show's best aspect. Both players try to quit at points, Beatrice starts to feel guilty about all her murders for no reason, the timeline jumps around and shows the future while a game is happening, and a whole new main character is introduced. So many things are introduced that don't seem worth the trouble.\\n\r\nWhen The Cicadas Cry got strength from its simplicity, but When The Seagulls Cry is too convoluted to have the same impact. There were plenty of impressive moments, and I liked it well enough, but it's not great, and certainly doesn't hold a candle to its predecessor.",

De huizen waren doorgaans niet meer dan eenvoudige hutten. Ook in deze periode was een groot deel van Duitsland bosgebied.\r\nHet grootste deel van de bevolking leefde in behoeftige omstandigheden. De gemiddelde levensverwachting bedroeg nauwelijks meer dan 30 jaar. De kindersterfte was zeer hoog. Slechts een minderheid van de bevolking bereikte de leeftijd van veertigjaar. Ziekte, honger, dood en geweld waren een periodiek terugkerend verschijnsel. Ondanks de kerstening behielden pre-christelijke elementen hun invloed; geloof in boze geesten, amuletten en magie waren wijdverbreid.\\n\\n\r\nIn de elfde eeuw werd de Duitse politiek mede beheerst door een conflict tussen de aristocratie en de achterleenmannen (vavassores), die in de regel van geboorte onvrij waren. Deze nieuwe sociale laag wordt doorgaans 'ministerialen' genoemd. Hun lenen waren niet erfelijk.\\n\r\nIn 1037 werd de \"Constitutio de feudis\" uitgevaardigd. Voortaan waren kleine lenen erfelijk. Er ontstond een klasse van ridders.\\n\r\nDe Duitse aristocratie was een bijna-ondoordringbare kaste. Deze groep besteedde veel tijd en energie aan langdurige onderlinge conflicten om macht en status, die veten worden genoemd. Van hen afhankelijke boeren werden met enige regelmaat gedwongen om krijgsdienst te verrichten.",

However, after seeing some mixed reviews about the anime, I didn't know if I wanted to watch it. Well, I did. So, this short review will primarily be for those who don't want too many spoilers about the plot, but still want something to quickly describe the overall experience. \r\nThe style of story reminds me of Deathnote, in that there is lots of talking and reasoning/mystery solving. However, if you liked Deathnote because of its plot's strongly analytical nature, you will be horrified upon watching this anime. I don'twant to say too much, but let's just say it's no Sherlock Holmes (or Deathnote P:). In this respect, Umineko no Naku Koro ni is a big, smelly turd of an anime.\\n\\n\r\nNow, IF (a very big if). IF you can look past a plot that doesn't make any sense at times, you will find a excitingly paced story that is always changing. Yet somehow, it resembles the original Higurashi's style as well. Everything else about the anime is pretty decent borderline enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I don't regret seeing this anime. It wasn't the most impressive, but it wasn't too bad (except some elements of the story) either. If you liked Higurashi, and can look past some major story flaws in this one, there's a chance you might like this*. But just keep in mind that the two anime are not of the same caliber.\\n\\n\r\n* I would watch up to episode 6 or so before deciding whether or not to continue.\\n\\n",

However, many things were vague as to why things happened the way they did in regards to the murders, so I continued to watch this anime, hoping that an explanation will come to give the audience a realization of what has happened. \\n\\n\r\nOnto that \"explanation\" that this anime tried to pull off: \\n\r\nSo there exists this witch named Beatrice that supposedly caused the murders, and she cannot be a full witch without everyone surrendering to her existence. And that is where the main character Battler, comes into challenge her because he denies it. At this point, the story gets good, as the mystery of the murders are supposedly cracked by Battler with intense logic and mind blowing but viable theories. Well, there ain't none of that in this anime until the final episode where he supposedly puts it all together from around episode 6 to 25, and literally sprouts bullshit that conveniently fits the pieces together. \\n\\n\r\nFrom episode to 6 to 25, it is painful to watch because of:\\n\r\n- slow pacing\\n\r\n- confusion\\n\r\n- \"wtf\" moments - why does he/she have powers? Is he/she good or bad? What kind of punishment is this? Why is Maria watching a television episode of higurashi? (LOL)\\n\r\n- random flashbacks to the past\\n\r\n- conveniently trying to explain another bullshit created during the episodes.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the art, nothing spectacular, but there are some \"gory\" scenes that aren't really gory but nasty in a way... I'll leave that up to you to decide if you really choose to watch this.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the things that made me really dislike this anime was the characters.\\n\r\nIt lacked any kind of character development (one could argue that Beatrice changed over a few episodes, but she really didn't, or about the girl that looks like Rin from fate/zero - she becomes a main character for a few episodes). \\n\r\nIn addition, there were so many annoying characters, not because they act their roles badly, but because they had additional \"Modus Operandi\" (i.e. Maria's annoying \"UuuUuu\" and her laugh that scares you only at first but becomes overly tiring to look at, or Beatrice's laugh and her constant reminder to the audience that she is Beatrice, and the infamous \"flip da chessboard\")\\n\\n\r\nSimply, \\n\r\nUminkeo is a rip off Higurashi.\\n\r\nI think the producer was trying to put all kinds of genre into one anime (magical girls, martial arts, crime, mystery, horror, suspense, romance, time travel ... etc) and it clearly didn't work.\\n\r\nI would not recommend this anime to anyone, unless they specifically look for as MAL users put \"a train-wreck\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "This review of Umineko no Naku Koro ni is based solely on its anime and nothing else. I will not be comparing it to anything else and will judge it solely on what the anime showcased. \r\nStory(5/10)\r\nUmineko no Naku Koro ni's story is rather difficult to understand because of how it is told. The anime follows Battler as he battles the Golden Witch Beatrice to try and save his family. This story could have worked if not for 3 main problems. The 1st problem in this anime is that the main plot quickly becomes repetitive to the point where you are just hoping to seesomeone get killed in a cool way and no longer care about the actual story. The 2nd problem is the mystery side to the story where it try's to get you to solve its puzzles but doesn't give you all the necessary pieces. 3rd and the largest of all the issues is the fact that the anime itself is unfinished. Its ending hardly explains any of the problems showcased throughout the story and instead tells you to simply guess what might've happened in the show.\\n\\n\r\nArt(8/10)\\n\\n\r\nI actually enjoyed the art style of the show. Not only were the characters designs are great and fit each character quite well to their personality but the way people moments of insanity are done greatly compliment the anime and its music. The gore and magic in the anime is also done very well and showcase the shows brutality brilliantly. \\n\\n\r\nSound(9/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe best part of this whole show is definitely the soundtrack which has some great mood music. But the best part is definently the OP and ED which are both done beautifully showcasing both the animation as well as the song to its fullest potiental.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(6/10)\\n\\n\r\nAnother flaw within the anime is its flimsy characters. Whereas normally you care when a character is savagely murdered in this you are typically happy when most of them die. The adults are all made out to be heartless creatures who only care about their own greed. However during many of their death they attempt to showcase some sense of humanity which is always just annoying, because by the time they do you honestly don't care. The servants and demons/witches are actually interesting and needed to be explained in much greater detail. The grandchildren or our main characters have strong personalities but this also gets annoying due to the story. Beatrice is so messed up and when I say this I mean her character is flawed (notice how I focus on her while I put everyone else in groups) she starts off as complete antagonist performing grizzly crimes and simply laughing at the murders (her laugh is  so annoying to where its more evil than her crimes). However her greatest flaw is the ending where she commits a giant 180 and is temporarily nice for no apparent reason... I wont even go on.\\n\\n\r\nOverall(7/10) \\n\\n\r\nMystery animes typically follow straight and linear paths giving clues to the audience of how certain murders or crimes take place to show how the culprit committed the crime and is then caught as is usually done this allows us the viewer to feel like we are part of the anime...  this doesn't do that. Even during few times that it does the show will completely ruin an intense mood by throwing flashbacks and backstory into the show completely ruining the mystery aspect of the anime. This causes the viewer to be completely disconnected from the show and not feel attached to these characters in any way. Its becomes repetitive very quickly and stops being an mystery anime completely. The few redeeming factors would probably be its animation and music which actually compliment the show quite well. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime needed another 25 episodes to be able to actually be completed as it is now the anime is literally incomplete causing everything story related to suffer, until such a thing happens there are too many plotholes to actually enjoy the anime. \\n\\n",

Ryukishi07 is nothing more than a genius for creating this spectacular universe. I\u00b4m not gonna write any spoiler, but i wanted to. It\u00b4s better than Higurashi,SURE. If you read everything it is. \\n\r\nThe art is spectacular; the story is over 10 points, that\u00b4s the best of all. The sound... I loooooooooooooooooooove that opening! And the ending is epic.
