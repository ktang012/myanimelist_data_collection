            "content": "Losing a beloved person would certainly leave any person stricken with grief and confusion: self-condemnation and thoughts of preventing such death are things that would cross anyones mind. Luckily in the case Boku Dake Inai Machi, or Erased in its english title, the protagonist Satoru Fujinuma finds himself able to travel back in time to prevent such tragedy from happening; furthermore, he is set back at the time where a fellow classmate died. This is not everything: the mystery surrounding the death of the girl also seems to be tied to that of his very own family. Erased is a psychological mystery anime that portrayshuman drama, yet sadly was very disappointing, being the characters and numerous plot holes the main culprits. However, it must be mentioned that it has a great direction in animation and a good buildup in the first few episodes, which arguably was enthralling, pulling viewers into the show.\\n\\n\r\n~Story~\\n\\n\r\nThe main problem in Erased lies in the little problems that become apparent as the show progresses: these ultimately are magnified by many others, which will be depicted. The concept of preventing occurrences through time travelling has been explored in numerous other works, yet a problem with the anime is the fact that these are completely random, allowing the author to make any necessary changes in direction when necessary. This is not bad on its own, yet instead of using it as means to develop the characters in the story, it utilizes it purely to change the direction in the narrative, which was not done in a subtle manner. Regardless of said issue, it managed to create some tension in the story as viewers never really could correctly anticipate the course of the narrative.\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned earlier, the protagonist is able to travel back in time to his 11-year-old self to prevent a certain death from happening, in a time in which one of his classmates died. However, it becomes soon apparent that the protagonist does not explore said option at all, and instead of going to the root of the problem, investigating the possible murder, he decides to protect Hinazuki, his classmate. Another complication is also associated with the mystery surrounding the murderer: it is very clear who it is, which is not a great issue on its own, but the anime does not offer any alternative that may leave viewers in doubt. In essence, this anime fails at being a good \"mystery\". The anime also presents human drama, yet was rather poorly portrayed because of the characters actions and all the events tied to those. These were often of very simple nature, such as parents beating their own child, deaths or betrayal just to name some. The main problem with these are that they're cheap, without ever sufficiently expanding on it in a satisfying manner. It must be said that it uses this to its advantage to create tension, but it is just that,  tension and shock factor without any strong meaning behind it. In addition, the anime sets up a lot of things, time-travelling, possible consequences of his own actions, yet just never explores them in-depth.\\n\\n\r\nThe problems are further magnified by the pacing of the work, which is rather lackluster as well. The introductionary episodes are satisfying, yet as the show progresses, it quickly becomes apparent that important segments that contribute to the overall plot are either too rushed or information is omitted, whereas the more \"mundane\" moments are too much focused upon. In fact, the majority of the show is centered around Hinazuki and her problems - but to this later. This actually brings into play the positive aspect of the anime, the interludes between the different occurrences, which are generally well executed portraying insight into the characters and their emotional state: however, this doesn't affect the important points of the story. There are just so many improbable events in the story that it just looses any credibility it has, going from nonsensical behaviour of the characters, or just the sheer amount of centering on the violence exerted by a second party - victimizing for the sake of it is not good writing.\\n\\n\r\n~Characters~\\n\\n\r\nThe major issue that brought the whole series down were its cast of characters: they didn't act according to their age, their motives/goals were either very lackluster or were just a mess, and ultimately the abrupt changes in behaviour to accommodate the direction in story. There is the 29-year-old Satoru, a typical otaku protagonist being mostly indifferent to society, and has the power to prevent deaths by sneakpeaking into the future. The main problem with this character is his incomprehensible and irrational behaviour he displays throughout the series, such as fleeing from a crime scene he didn't commit or even attempt on murder. In addition, his main goal of seeking the killer just shifts from finding the murderer to protecting his classmate - which in turn brings up the pedophilic tendencies the protagonist displays towards the minor. The anime develops a light romance, which includes Satoru constantly thinking of either being together with said person, or even imagining things when in the bathroom. This came out of nowhere, and just felt very off-putting for obvious reasons. Character development is present, yet is lackluster and limited by the actions of the character himself; rather than resolving the issues on his own, it gets resolved by a second party, which is understandable due to his physical appearance, yet could have been expanded on.\\n\\n\r\nThen there is Hinazuki, a victim of child abuse, which throughout almost the whole series is treated as a mere plot device, rather than human being - it could be compared to seeing a soulless robot. Luckily enough, she gets fleshed out in which through subtle scenes her human side is displayed. Which is a nice change to the constant unnecessary abuse scenes. Other character of interest is the super intelligent psychoanalyst Kenya, who possesses an intellect far superior to that of Satoru despite being only 11 years old. He aids the main character in many instances, yet his motives behind why he supports the protagonist are rather lacking as well, as he apparently was smart enough to solve various issues. Finally, the last character of interest is the murderer: although he is portrayed to be a mastermind behind the scenes, avoiding detection over the span of several decades, he makes tremendous mistakes when the main character is concerned. He ultimately degrades to a simple one-dimensional villain with no convincing motive at all: furthermore, this also raises the question why said person took so many poor decisions and why he just didn't switch his killing target(s) when things became too heated and unfavourable.\\n\\n\r\nThe various interactions between the cast are handled poorly in most cases, be it the one dimensional evil parent or perverted manager, or the supporting cast whose poor choices leads viewers questioning their mental age; or just the fact that most act as passive observers.  Because of the stale personalities of the cast and their changes in behaviour, the interactions between them feel unnatural: however, this mainly affects the main plot points. For the slice of life moments, these were often well handled by the studio - those were often the most enjoyable parts of the anime, which is a huge disappointment, as it is not the main purpose of the show.\\n\\n\r\n~Animation and sound~\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that can be given credit to the studio is its direction and use of animation: this was well done, displaying the various themes the anime had to offer such as loneliness, isolation, happiness, you name it. Through the art it is able to portray the different emotional states as well as physical conditions of the characters; despite executing this well, it is rendered useless when the narrative constantly shows constant abuse, making these little detail utterly pointless, which is a waste of resources. An example would be the focussing upon the bruises of Hinazuki. As for the art style itself, I personally didn't like it and found it off in some situations, be it in the character design or the different facial expressions. The anime also tried to mitigate the problem regarding the mystery behind the killer by applying red eyes to suspects, yet this is a cheap alternative to creating tension, and when everyone is can have those eyes, it loses its purpose.\\n\\n\r\nConcerning the soundtrack of Erased, it often uses the different compositions to its advantage to correctly portray the various atmospheres of the show, intertwining with the dialogue: piano, violins, xylophones, gloomy tones, you name it. There is fact a huge preference to classical instruments, which was a good choice. The opening and endings were equally well crafted, presenting the themes the anime had to offer with some pop tunes to it. As for the voice actors, these generally performed their tasks well, complying with the different personalities of the cast. This wasn't entirely the case with the protagonists, where no significant difference could be appreciated from his various emotional states.\\n\\n\r\n~Enjoyment~\\n\\n\r\nErased had some potential, yet failed in executing the basic elements of the show, which was due to the little issues that ultimately snowballed into bigger ones - which is a shame, as its direction and usage of animation was befitting and well executed.  I quite honestly did not enjoy the series at all, despite being intrigued by the first batch of episodes: the characters, lack of expansion upon key elements as the villain or time travelling gimmick are just a few of the many issues that made it a bad anime. It fails in providing a good mystery with cheap cliffhangers and shock factor to accomplish tension. It praises itself on being a human drama, but it equally lacks in said theme. Now I will admit I never have been a fan of drama, which made it more difficult to enjoy that genre. I personally do not recommend this anime, unless you aren't bothered by the above mentioned problems - which in turn, can make for an intriguing ride. Boku Dake Inai Machi is ultimately a show that feeds itself on cheap emotions and thrills.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading.\\n",

            "content": "Note: Tl;dr at the end for the lazy ones.\r\n*MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*\r\nBoku dake ga Inai Machi, or Erased in English, is clearly the most popular Winter Season Anime of 2016. With it's sky rocketing popularity and rank on myanimelist in such a small amount of time, Erased has successfully caught the attention of the crowd and everyone has probably watched it or thought of watching it soon. Here on myanimelist, most of the reviewers are filled with negativity and are over-exaggerating the negative points of this anime. It is not that bad as most of the reviews are indicating here. So here I'm writing a honestand positive review of Erased.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\r\nErased narrates the story of Satoru Fujinuma, who is a 29 years old and works as a pizza delivery boy. He posses a strange ability called 'Revival'. This ability, 'Revival' sends him 2 to 5 minutes back in time, without his consent, whenever something dangerous happens around him. He usually tries to figure out what is wrong in his surroundings and tries to prevent that dangerous thing from happening. When he was wrongfully accused of murdering his mom, in the first episode itself, he is sent 18 years back in time when he was 11 years old in 6th grade where he tries to solve one mystery of serial abduction and murder going around the school to prevent his mother's murder in the future as they seemed related.\\n\r\nI feel that the initial story (from first to fourth episode) is the reason why Erased became so popular and highly rated! It's thrilling! The suspense will really eat you and will left you wanting for more. You will probably want to binge-watch the show or jump onto reading the manga to know more.\\n\r\nBut after the first half of the show, I feel that the story starts moving in a wrong direction and it sort of becomes less thrilling. The studio was clearly rushing a bit to complete the anime in 12 episodes only.\\n\r\nThere are many things which are left unexplained. For example, Satoru's ability of 'Revival'. So yeah that's the reason why I have rated the 'Story' section 8 instead of 10.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nErased clearly flaunts it's art in many ways. The backgrounds and scenes, like the Christmas Tree scene which was made using the stars in the sky, successfully delivers warm and entertaining moments. The way 'Revival' is portrayed by showing a blue butterfly across the screen and the way history or the future is compared with the timeline using movie reels makes Erased more interesting to watch. The suspenseful atmosphere which Erased is able to create, and the facial expressions which arouses suspicions on various characters are perfectly executed which supports it's mystery genre incredibly well.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nBeing a fan of Asian Kung-Fu Generation, I loved the opening of Erased, \"Re:Re:\" right off the bat. The ED \"Sore wa Chiisana Hikari no Youna\" by Sayuri is a beautiful song indeed. The OSTs are carefully played at crucial moments and is able to set the suspenseful mood very nicely.\\n\r\nComing to the voice actors, they have done an incredible acting. The way Satoru uses his adult voice to show his real mature self is interesting.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nThere are some characters whom I really liked. And there are a few for whom I don't give a damn.\\n\r\nSatoru Fujinuma, as an adult, is a very boring character. But he has a really good side which forces him to save people whenever 'Revival' is triggered, and sometimes he even hurts himself in that process. On the other hand, Satoru, as a kid, seems more interesting. His boring side is removed and he's got determination, sense of humor and a really cool and gutsy side which makes him a likable character.\\n\r\nKayo Hinazuki, the girl whom Satoru is determined to save from being the victim on the serial murders, gets a good amount of screen time and development. The circumstances which she is going through like being abused by her mother or bullied by her classmates makes us sympathize her.\\n\r\nSachiko Fujinuma, Satoru's mother, is another great character. She has been portrayed as a very honest, caring and courageous mother with high willpower. She cooperates with her son in saving Hinazuki from her mother's abuse and nursed his son for 4 hours daily for 15 years which emphasizes mother's love.\\n\r\nApart from these three characters, Airi Katagiri (a coworker of Satoru in a pizza shop), Kobayashi Kenya (smartest childhood friend of Satoru) etc are a few people who get a little amount of screen time but are still likable.\\n\r\nOn the other hand, I never became much attached to Nakanishi Aya or Sugita Hiromi (other two victims of the serial murders) and most of the other side characters.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nThe idea of putting a supernatural ability like time travel is not a new one. I have seen Steins;Gate, Puella Magi Madoka Magica, Higurashi: When They Cry, Charlotte etc in which the character goes back in time to save his friend again and again. Erased, is actually different than all these titles above. It has a dominant mystery genre which is centered around realistic and old school mystery of serial abduction and murdering which makes it enjoyable. If you are into mystery and detective shows then this anime is pretty much recommended.\\n\r\nIn the initial episodes, the pacing was excellent. The show does an excellent job in creating suspense and leaves us wanting to know more. But in the second half, it starts to feel a little rush, but still it is able to maintain the the quality of it's genre.\\n\r\nErased maintains a good sense of humor which makes it fun to watch. For example, Satoru, in his young form, often speaks something out loud while thinking it which puts him into embarrassing or awkward situations.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nWhile Erased is a very enjoyable anime, it still is far from perfect. There are many things left untold, for example, the origin behind Satoru's ability 'Revival'. And it makes even lesser sense in the whole Erased world that Satoru is the only one having this ability. Infact this ability is the only thing which makes this anime a part of Supernatural genre.\\n\r\nMany realistic and thought provoking philosophical themes are offered by this anime. For example, mother's love for her child, child's love for his mother, frustrated parent's abuse on their child, loneliness in youth age, bullies in school, human's tendency to run away from problems, human's tendency to help other's in need, parent's situation whey their child is in a permanent bed rest for years, and I can go on and on.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTl;dr:\\n\\n\r\n+Very interesting and engaging premise\\n\r\n+Great art and animation style which is suitable for a mystery anime\\n\r\n+Main characters are realistic and interesting\\n\r\n+Great OSTs, OP and ED, excellent voice acting\\n\r\n+Lots of philosophical themes\\n\\n\r\n-Story becomes a little monotonous in the second half\\n\r\n-It starts to feel a little rushed, especially in the last quarter\\n\r\n-Many characters got a very little screentime and character development\\n\r\n-Many things, including the ability 'Revival', are left unexplained\\n\r\n-Sometimes it becomes predictable\\n\\n\\n\r\nErased is an anime, which you must watch this year. Though only one season has ended, I can guarantee that Erased is going to be one of the best, if not the best, anime of 2016. So if you haven't watched it already, then go for it!",

            "content": "~ updated 03/24 ~\r\nEnglish is not my first language so I'm doing my best writing this review, sorry!\r\nSpoilers of the first episodes ahead!\r\n\u2727 Introduction/the story:\r\nSomeone travels through time to save a person he/she cares for. I've already seen this. Madoka Magica, Steins;Gate, Higurashi. No creativity in that aspect, and in the case of Erased it's even worse because the time travel has no explanation at all. This is not a deconstruction and does not present something we have not seen before. This would not matter if the premise was well executed, but this isn't the case either, let me explain why.\r\n\u2727 The characters:\r\nThe MC isa cold, edgy guy that is good on the inside, I'm not saying this is a bad thing, but it makes him cliche and boring. He is also terribly written, acting like the story needs him to act, he goes through traumatic situations as he goes to work every day. This would be excused if this was a fighting shonen, but we are talking about a seinen with mystery and drama. The main character even acts irrationally running out of his house when a neighbour saw him near the body of his mom and thought it was him who killed her, which is quite impossible too, why would he worry about being accused of homicide if there are some little things called inspection of the crime scene and evidence?, of course the MC has no absolutely no reason to kill his own mother, which poses the question: is the police brainless in this world or something?\\n\\n\r\nIn spite of having a 29 year old mind, he still acts like a child most of the time. The excuse given to the viewers is that he wants others to like him (which is kinda contradictory too, because on the first episode he's cold with everyone), for example, instead of asking for all the help he can when he travels to the past, he thinks he can do everything on his own, which is childish and illogical. Nevermind that he is only a bit surprised when he travels 18 years on the past, when he should be extremely confused and overwhelmed by the situation.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters act like soulless robots too, especially the ones that talk to the MC about the murder of his mother like they were talking about the weather, they are also forgettable because most of them act like passive observers.\\n\\n\r\nThe actual kids doesn't talk or act like kids in this show, which takes away all the credibility. For example, there's even a little boy who suspects that the MC is up to something, and when he decides to talk with him, it's like he just read the MC's mind. We are talking about a 10 year old kid, not about a private detective.\\n\\n\r\n\u2727 Satoru's power:\\n\r\nIt's supposed that he \"applies\" his time travel powers to save his mom, but instead of focusing on that, he tries to save a girl he barely knew. Why would he care about her instead of worry more about his mom and his friend? I know the disappearance of the girl and the murder of his mom are kinda related, but there is not a direct factor between the two events, I mean, yes, he can save his classmate, but the kidnapper could abduct any kid they wanted and the events would end up being the same or simmilar.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, if the MC's mind applies the time travel like in the first episode, why didn't this happen when he saw her full of bruises? the time travel has no rules or explanation so the writers can make up anything that is convenient for the plot. You can see the inconstancy of his power only on the first episode.\\n\\n\r\n\u2727 The script:\\n\r\nThis anime also presents some themes through the dialogue, such as depression, or even existentialism, but never explores them properly, it feels like they were put there just to turn the dialogue into something \"out of the ordinary\"\\n\\n\r\nThe show also presents pretentiousness by showing how a girl is hit by her mom, which is not even necessary and it's shock factor, only there for people who get emotionally manipulated easily.\\n\\n\r\nAnd no, the abuse is not there to delve into the psyche of the girl, it's just there to victimize her. These themes need to be explored with more delicacy and should not be thrown in your face like this. If you remove those scenes, the story would remain the same, just implying it with the bruises would have been enough, but no, you need to feel bad for a character about which you know literally nothing more than that she is a cute, but abused child. We can only conclude that this series also fails miserably on the psychological aspect.\\n\\n\r\nErased also fails as a mystery series, because the murderer ends up being really obvious and they don't give us the opportunity of using our minds or feeling excited about the mystery itself because the way that is developed is very hard-set and they never give it too much importance.\\n\\n\r\nThe drama on this anime is also forced and ridiculous sometimes, to the point that they want to convince us that a reason for a divorce could be something as improbable as an accusation of stealing a chocolate bar. And the viewers are supposed to take that seriously and feel bad for the characters. This was also an external excuse for the MC to have an ally.\\n\\n\r\n\u2727 The villains:\\n\r\nAnother aspect in which Erased fails with its writing, are clearly the villains, we have two villains, Kayo's mom and the murderer who killed Satoru's mother and the kids.\\n\\n\r\nFirst, we're going to talk about Kayo's mom:\\n\r\nAt first, the show never gives any reasons for the abuse and Kayo's mom even looks happy while beating her own child. You may say that these things happens in the real world all the time, but that doesn't make them realistic or relatable, because not only was the girl murdered by a psychopath, but she was also abused by her mom with no motives at all.\\n\r\nThere's always a motive behind such acts in real life. For instance, does her mom have a mental illness? in other words, on why her mom hits her and not only on the act of abuse.\\n\r\nThen, when it's already late for delving into real problems or motivations, the show explains in literally two minutes the \"reason\" of her being a abuser, this is presented very superficially and in a way that her, Kayo's mom, ends up being victimized too.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the main villain:\\n\r\nI'm not going to say who they are, but their \"reasons\" for killing little children are also very bad excused through a very morbid metaphor. We never get to know him enough to know his true motives.\\n\\n\r\nPeople who are bad just because, are a big problem.\\n\\n\r\n\u2727 Production values:\\n\r\nThis anime has a very good animation with delicate shadows and a soft color palette that mix perfectly with the bittersweet feeling that the story wants to transmit. It's also very interesting how they put 2 voices on the MC to differentiate between his old mind and his young body.\\n\r\nThe music is on point with the feeling of the characters and it mimetizes perfectly with the way that the characters interact.\\n\\n\r\nThe cinematic effect that shows the memories of the MC is very nice and interesting, but they could have taken more advantage of it. It doesn't fit the story altogether.\\n\\n\r\n\u2727 Conclusion:\\n\r\nThis anime is bad, it has poor theme exploration, it's full of conveniences, plot holes, fails on its psychological aspect and creating a good mystery, the tension and the drama are meaningless and the only good aspects are the production values.",

            "content": "It's becoming more apparent to me by each passing season that if an anime gets any sort of recognition like this, it's bound to divide the community into 2 groups. The majority goes on to ride the hype train and hype the series in question up to the high heavens, while the other hops onto the hate train and then the shit-fest begins. I usually see myself not siding with any of these but frankly, the latter seems more reasonable to me than it ever was. I'll try to offer an unbiased opinion on this even though seeing its rating is kinda baffling. So let'sget into it, the most hyped up anime of the season and quite possibly the most overrated anime of the year (I'm asking to get shot, aren't I?) - Boku dake ga Inai Machi, otherwise known simply as Erased. This review won't spoil anything beyond the first episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe story centers around a 29 year old emo Pizza Hut employee who is trying to become a mangaka. On the other hand, he also has a reset power, \"Revival\", that occurs a few minutes before an accident, lending him the ability to stop said accident before it ever takes place. So yeah, he's basically a Final Destination lead. One day, while stopping an accident from happening he gets injured and in that time his mother moves in to live with him. The next day in Satoru's absence, his mother is stabbed in the back and killed in his apartment by some random guy with a fedora. Do you see the problem here? I said the next day which is quite literally the next day. We don't even get a full episode to get to know or sympathize with this character. Instead we just know her for half of the first episode until she is brutally murdered. Oh no, it's almost like Attack on Titan. Who didn't cry at the first episode of Attack on Titan?!\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, we don't know the man who did it nor do we know his intentions. When Satoru arrives to the crime scene, someone conveniently finds him next to his mother's corpse with blood on his hands. Everything is going downhill for Satoru as the police arrives when he is suddenly, out of nowhere sent 18 years into the past to the year 1988, which at the time he was merely a 10 year old elementary school student. It definitely isn't too far of a stretch to say this is a lame plot device at this point, especially now that he has no control over it. Also, I'd like to mention how further down the line Satoru says that it will be his last Revival. So how does this thing work? Plot convenience, duh.\\n\\n\r\nPrior to this it is also shown that a few kids from Satoru's school were murdered at that time period, namely our loli heroine, Kayo Hinazuki. Hinazuki was a troubled and lonely girl who never got along with anyone and was often abused by her mother. Satoru decides that as well as preventing his mother's death, he will also save Hinazuki before her birthday which is on the 2nd of March. Considering it's already mid February he doesn't have much time. The accused murderer of these kids was 23 year old Jun Shiratori or known to the children simply as Yuuki  due to his courageous nature. He was a person who would always approach the lone students around his house, which already raises a giant red flag. However, Satoru always remembered Yuuki to be a kindhearted and happy guy who would never commit a crime.  \\n\\n\r\nSo obviously the show's primary element is mystery, which I have mixed feelings about. If the mystery is done well it can really lead to a great series, but that usually isn't very easy to pull off and more often that not it just falls flat. The worst mistake a mystery series can make in my eyes is when it raises so many questions but in the end fails to answer them, or maybe just leave it off at a cliffhanger like Rokka no Yuusha. Erased done well in that aspect, seeing as it didn't raise that many questions to begin with. See, what I think is the main problem in Erased's mystery department is the amount of suspects it brings up, or lack thereof. 4 episodes in I was pretty confident in my guess on who the killer was as it was so easy to trace back once you actually think about it. I would of been surprised if my guess was wrong to be totally honest, and that's not because I'm some sort of super-genius.\\n\\n\r\nI seem to have a very obvious bias when it comes to works done by A-1 Pictures. I thought the art style resembled their previous works too strongly and therefore it derived from the series for me as it didn't strike me as dark enough in tone, especially for the kind of series Erased is. So, much like the opening and ending, the art and animation slowly grew on me the further it went on. It's very soothing and visually appealing. Combined with a decent musical direction and atmosphere it even felt cinematic at times.\\n\\n\r\nI wasn't a very big fan of the opening at first to be honest but it gradually grew on me and is easily the best opening of the season and even one of my all-time favorites. That also applies to the ending, it's neat too. As for the OST, I'm indifferent about it. There wasn't anything that struck me as good or above average, it all just felt like regular background music to me but it does it's role, for what it's worth. The voice acting is rather impressive as everyone had a great performance. Seeing as both of Satoru's seiyuu never done any previous work, regarding anime at least impressed me quite a bit. I especially like the guy that does the adult version, his voice is very soothing. Aoi Yuuki was also really good at portraying Hinazuki's character but that is to be expected.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Erased are for the most part incredibly lackluster - from the protagonist to the supporting cast. Because most of the series takes place in the past, a lot of the characters are just 10 year olds, which leads me to my next point - Most of these kids don't even act their age! At parts they act like full-grown adults which really derives from the show, why even bother making them kids in the first place? Looking at you, Kenya, Hinazuki.\\n\\n\r\nSatoru, while being more interesting than your harem protagonist doesn't have that much going for him, which is fine to a point because the characters aren't really where the series shines but his character could have definitely been more solid or maybe had a stronger personality. He doesn't seem like he particularly enjoys the time resets, but he still decides to help out. What a nice guy! The series has a much heavier focus on the past than the present, so for the most part we just get kid Satoru. Well, he's just a normal 30 year old man who's trying to save his 10 year old girlfriend from her seemingly inevitable demise. Sounds about right.\\n\\n\r\nHinazuki is a very reserved and closed off girl but she opens up more and more as the series progresses. She gets abused by her parents for some unknown reason aka SHOCK FACTORRRRR. She suffers from the same problem as Satoru, as she doesn't have a personality that defines her either. Instead (for the most part) we are simply supposed to feel sorry for her and like her because of the predicament she's in. She is pretty cute though - good character.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast is also very lacking, filled with 1-dimensional characters. The reasoning of a lot of characters can be pretty unreasonable and even ludicrous at times - people getting divorced because of a chocolate bar, etc. Then you have characters like Hinazuki's mother who, every time she is on screen tends to turn this show into a misery porn galore. \\n\\n\r\nKenya is another instance of wasted potential. They done as much as they could to make us understand that he is incredibly intelligent and by the end of it all, he barely does anything and his character is awfully utilized. I feel the same way about the killer as I've heard his reasoning is a lot clearer and better explained in the manga. It's not that surprising though as they did try to bash 8 volumes into a 12 episode series. All in all, the characters aren't done very well.\\n\\n\r\nI can sit here all I want and point out the flaws of the show, but truth be told, I had quite a lot of fun with it! I think this is mostly due to how the pacing was handled as it is very fast for pretty much the entirety of the series, yet tends to not feel rushed for the majority of the first half. Only at about the halfway point does the pacing start to affect my outlook on it and turns for the worst. Despite this, I was still entertained for most of the show. The two major downfalls here are the tremendous amount of plot conveniences all throughout the story and the (in my opinion) poorly done mystery.\\n\\n\r\nErased is mediocre in every sense of the word. Despite that, I'd still argue that it's one of the better titles of the season. Does it deserve the hype, praise and to be ranked higher than LotGH? NO. The characters are awfully lackluster + the story is not that great as it has to rely on an iffy plot device and a ton of plot conveniences throughout. I wanted to say that it has more good than bad but A-1 stayed true to their nature and managed to ruin a promising show for me, once again.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I don't think Erased is neither as good as some praise it to be nor as bad as others make it out to be, it's simply average. It's like a rollercoaster and the further you go down, the messier it becomes. However, if you're not a critical watcher and just want to have some fun, Erased is definitely your go-to this season. Sorry in advance if this review gives you suicidal tendencies for not giving it a perfect score.",

            "content": "[Warning: this review will contain vague spoilers]\r\nI was originally not planning in writing anything in regards to this anime in specific, as I thought I had nothing interesting to say about the title. However, after reading the analysis by Zephsilver, I managed to put together some thoughts in regards to Boku Dake ga Inai Machi (or Erased, if you are not fond of tongue-twisters) that I\u2019d like to offer in addition to the debate. I also would like to say: Zeph, I appreciate and respect your text, since it had a rational depiction of your perspective that I could reasonably grasp, but I\u2019d like topolitely disagree.\\n\\n\r\nBefore getting into the review, though, I want to give some context: before the beginning of the winter season I had read the synopsis of Erased and added to my Plan to Watch list, as it seemed mildly interesting. Later, after watching the first two episodes, I was hooked by the premise and highly invested in what could be the outcome of the story. Only then that I got to know about the hype surrounding the series and from that point I witnessed the internet go insane over its score.\\n\\n\r\nStory and Characters\\n\\n\r\nMy reviewing method for this one will be somewhat different from the norm. By the time I\u2019m writing this, the series itself is still surrounded by controversy with two sides with very questionable motivations either raising it as the best thing since Page 3 or clamming it\u2019s an overrated abomination pandering to masses who want to think of themselves as smart (doesn\u2019t that apply to 99% of humanity?). Here, besides commenting of the story and characters within the work, I\u2019ll also discus some of the arguments brought up against Erased and offer my perspective if they are correct in any form or if they hold any water. The first thing I think it\u2019s important to understand is that Erased is, at its core, a very simple story. Besides the time-traveling plot, it has a very streamlined narrative and it is focused almost exclusively on the actions of the main character, in accordance to the fact that he is the \u201cstrange element\u201d in the child timeline (suddenly feels like I\u2019m talking about Zelda!). What it avoids in complexity, it opts to use in character interaction, developing the drama and the motivations that move the story forward. Before I get to the meat of the argument, though, let\u2019s talk about some of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nFujinuma Satoru is the main protagonist. \u201cGifted\u201d with the ability he calls Revival, he can go back a few minutes in time, whenever something bad is about to happen. Detached and constantly feeling unfulfilled, he holds a strong regret due to events of his childhood, when two of his classmates were murdered and one of his friends was incriminated. These feelings lead him to distance himself from his past, but he is forced by a Revival to go back to the days of his childhood in order to prevent those crimes.\\n\\n\r\nHinazuki Kayo is the girl who Satoru wants to prevent from becoming the first victim. Frequently abused by her mother, she avoids interacting with her classmates and is usually seen alone. She initially tries to keep a distance from Satoru, not understanding his motives for trying to get close to her, but his friendly demeanor ends up softening her emotional barriers.\\n\\n\r\nYashiro Gaku is Satoru\u2019s teacher and one of the main agents in the narrative, as he seems interested in solving Kayo\u2019s family situation. Satoru later comments on how Yashiro was an influence to him due to a speech he gave at school, before the story had began, and a specific moment in which Yashiro looked like what Satoru expected his deceased father to be.\\n\\n\r\nShiratori Jun, mostly known as Courage, is an adult who was friends with Satoru in his childhood. Socially awkward and with a heavy stutter, he feels more comfortable interacting with children, which leads him to be framed for the child-murders Satoru tries to prevent. Besides feeding the motivations of the protagonist, the story also uses him to briefly comment in how his inability to be socially active and preferring the company of children led society to misjudge his intentions, especially when Satoru faces a similar situation in the future.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the thriller aspect of the anime is in the center of the driving forces of the narrative, the bulk of the emotional investment Erased strives to build is on the bonding between Satoru and the people he is trying to save, and his motivations within the story. Great focus is given to his interactions with his friends, who with the exception of Ken\u2019ya, who seems unusually mature for someone of his age, are all very believable child characters. By that I don\u2019t mean being as obnoxious as an inch-deep testicle wound, by the way, these kids are actually designed to be likeable. This aspect of the story is built upon until the conclusion, where they play a part in finally getting the killer arrested. Having all of this in mind, let\u2019s tackle some of the complaints about the series.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cThe time travel element is underdeveloped\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThe time travel element is kept simple. Firstly, Satoru\u2019s ability to go back in time is nothing more than a plot device to put him on the track of the murders and since it seems to be simply a supernatural element instead of the usual sci-fi occurring, keeping it simply is a better idea. The story in Erased isn't about time travel, it just features such element as the one necessary for kicking the narrative into motion. Stories that are centered around time travel usually stumble and fall when they decide to flesh out this element without paying proper attention to consistency, which leads to gross plot-holes. Maintaining this element simple and undetailed allows Erased to avoid major inconsistences and focus on the main drive of the story. Also, I know some people were upset by the second instance where Satoru goes back to his child-self as it seemed he had gained control over his ability. To that, I hope you can forgive me stepping out of my polite demeanor for a while to say: For fuck\u2019s sake, that only happened ONCE and it doesn\u2019t even look like he had much control over it! Being it a supernatural ability, and one that seems to have a mind of its own, nonetheless, the event itself isn't so out of place as one might think.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cThe identity of the killer is obvious and the reveal is underwhelming\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThis complaint is one that fans and detractors of the series seem to agree, although in different levels of importance. I mean, the opening itself tells you who it is. The point of contention here is not whether or not the average viewer can easily guess the killer\u2019s identity, but the purpose that such attribute plays in the story. To some, working under the mindset that Erased\u2019s genre is Mystery; such flaw would represent a sign of incompetent use of red-herrings, as well as inability from the writer to effectively create other suspects. In other words, hack writing. Fans of the series, however, work under the mindset that Erased is, in reality, a Thriller. Such idea is supported by an interview with the director of the anime, where he states:\\n\\n\r\n-\t\u201cI see this story as a suspense thriller, or well, a human drama in the guise of a suspense thriller\u201d\\n\\n\r\nBy that definition, the tension within the story would come not from the mystery over the killer\u2019s identity, which is constantly flashed throughout the story, but from the knowledge the audience has in opposition to the cast, since knowing who is the killer would raise tension whenever he and the main characters were close, and that emotion would then culminate when the villain finally reveals itself for the protagonist. Some of his attitudes could be very ambiguous, like the ones at episode 09, but they ultimately filled the role of driving him closer to Satoru, which would then lead to their connection in the years to come, finally bringing his downfall, as Satoru himself had become the killer\u2019s weakness.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cErased becomes an unfocused mess in the latter half\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThis is the one argument to which my response is a categorical NO. Before I get into a fair explanation in relation to that statement, though, let give a better example of how to define lack of focus. For that, I\u2019ll actually give the other face and throw under the bus an anime that just so happens to be one of my favorites, Ergo Proxy, because self-awareness is important. The first 8 episodes of the anime are some of the most tightly written episodes in anime, with barely any line of dialogue wasted and plenty of subtle details in character reactions. Right before the first half, though, the main characters go into a journey looking for the truth behind the main mystery of the series, and from that point on Ergo Proxy adopts a highly experimental structure, focusing plenty of episodes in isolated conflicts tied only to the theme it wanted to address in that specific episode (I apologize for the repetition). Very little of those episodes has connection to the main goal, and when the characters reach their destination it turns out to be a dead end, forcing them to return in order to find the truth. For all of that, it\u2019s not unreasonable to say that Ergo Proxy specifically lacks focus on its narrative. From the point Kayo leaves the center of the plot, Satoru\u2019s objectives change, from saving the girl to protecting the other victims and uncovering the identity of the assassin. As a result, the series follows along with such change and turns its eyes to him, in the same fashion as does the danger of attracting the attention of the villain, just like we would see later on, when Satoru\u2019s actions lead him to be the new target. In that sense, the anime simply shifts its focus, it didn\u2019t lose it and that was the natural root to take. That also leads us to another topic;\\n\\n\r\n\u201cErased lost its charm once Kayo left the picture\u201d\\n\\n\r\nI always found questionable the idea of attributing the entire appeal of a story in a side-character, but that aside, let\u2019s understand this argument: The idea here is that, since the anime spent so much time revolving around Satoru\u2019s efforts to save Kayo, much of the audience\u2019s investment was crafted around the girl, as she would be the one the viewer would immediately want to see shielded from harm. The series does many efforts to frame her in sympathetic light and give her endearing qualities, so when she is moved away from the plot many felt it had wasted their investment. This is a comprehensible thought, indeed, but I believe it ignores another important aspect of fiction: by maintaining focus on a character that has already fulfilled its narrative purpose, the work runs the risk of saturating such character, diminishing the values that made them endearing in the first place and ultimately compromising the story to make room for them. Moving Kayo away from the narrative not only makes sense from a logical point of view, as it completely places her away from the killer, but also preserves her from becoming a hindrance to the story and leaves her character with the emotional baggage that comes at play during the last episodes. There is a merit in avoiding wish-fulfillment if it prevents characters from becoming a problem to the flow of the narrative.\\n\\n\\n\r\n\"The ending is rushed and the villain's motivations are poorly explained\"\\n\\n\r\nThis criticism specifically I can understand on the basis of how the anime progresses in his final episodes, but I\u2019d like to explain the reason for my disagreement by discussing one of the references made by the villain, the spider thread tale. This element is first brought up at the beginning of episode 11, when the antagonist comments that after a specific event during his childhood, he begins to see spider threads hanging above the heads of his victims, in reference to a tale about a criminal who gets the chance to escape from hell using the thread sent by Shakyamuni Bhudda, but is condemned once again when the thread breaks, in punishment for his selfishness. In this tale, the thread was the last source of salvation given by a superior being to a soul in despair, so seeing it above the heads of those he wanted to kill can be interpreted as the antagonist\u2019s desire to be someone above his victims, to be an \u201centity\u201d with the power to condemn or give salvation. When he is finally defeated by Satoru, he sees a spider thread above his own head be torn apart. This is the point when he realizes that he was powerless and susceptible to being manipulated and judged just like his victims, he realizes he\u2019s not an entity in control. By the same line of thought, he takes an interest in Satoru, after the kid survives his first attempt to kill him, because Satoru was the one able to escape his judgment.\\n\\n\r\nPresentation\\n\\n\r\nI believe many of you heard Erased\u2019s visuals being called \u201ccinematic\u201d and that is actually a statement that holds water, as the anime utilizes some techniques of traditional cinema in much more noticeable fashion, a result of the experience the director had working with other professionals like Hosoda Mamoru or Araki Tetsuro, this last one an expert on making anime with mainstream appeal. Now, another term I believe can be applied to the show\u2019s presentation, in general, is minimalistic. The characters are frequently framed in wide shots within the scenery, with the fixed camera giving full comprehension of the environment while the figures are kept small and with minimal action. The purpose of this directing style is to avoid the viewer getting lost in the imagery and lead them to focus only on the details that are relevant to the narrative. In the other hand, it also serves to emphasize emotional moments and heighten the impact of scenes that display a little bit more of flare, giving them a whimsical feel.\\n\\n\r\nA minimalistic presentation, when executed effectively, can suscinctly drive home the emotional core of the scene, and i'd say that Erased uses that method with excelence. This trait also manifests in the characterization, as the shots stealthily introduce certain details and character motivations, like the hero\u2019s Mask in Satoru\u2019s bedroom, to show a figure that inspired him as a kid, or in the manner in which the killer is framed, from the point he\u2019s fully introduced to the brief interactions that hint to his identity, like when the camera is focused upwards, mirroring Satoru\u2019s perspective. These choices of framing serve to cut on the necessity of exposition, reducing the dialogue only to what is essential. This can also be noticed on the sound work: important scenes, like the moment Satoru makes the first impactful contact with Hinazuki, frequently opt for not having soundtrack, driving even more attention to the dialogue and giving full responsibility to the viewer to infer on what is going on between the characters. For an anime that has been accused of being heavy-handed, I\u2019d say this directorial decision is pretty respectful towards the audience.\\n\\n\r\nThe points that feature soundtrack, though, don\u2019t tend to be impressive. Most of the noticeable tracks play their purpose, but are fairly generic, serving only to highlight the specific mood the scene wants to convey. Exceptions would be, of course, the highly catch opening, the fitting and mellow ending, and tracks such as \u201cOnly I am missing\u201d, \u201cI have to save her\u201d, which is brief but very effective at crafting tension despite the upbeat vibe, \u201cReasoning\u201d and \u201cShe was there, alone\u201d. Hum, I\u2019m noticing a pattern here! When it comes to the acting, it\u2019s very consistent with character portrayal and overall quite solid, but one aspect that might raise disagreements, more than usual at least, is Satoru\u2019s voice actor. Despite a solid performance, even taking into consideration it\u2019s his first anime role, Shinnosuke Mitsushima is one of those actors who has a voice that is too singular, which can drive attention away from the acting itself.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Ramblings\\n\\n\r\nI think now we can address some of the external questions related to Erased.\\n\\n\r\nIs Erased the best thing since dark beer? No, I can myself point out more than a handful of titles that are better, without taking away from the anime itself. Was it overhyped? Sure! I mean, it\u2019s hard to refute that an anime getting into MAL\u2019s top 10 before it is even finished is quite a ludicrous event. Is the negativity warranted? My stance, at least, is \u201cnot really\u201d. I believe it\u2019s fair to ask how much of the negativity towards the series is a direct result of its hype, as some people might think it pressures them into a position. I\u2019ve seen even better shows get attacked with far less meaningful arguments, as a result of public opinion being highly favorable towards them, so the attitude itself doesn\u2019t surprise me. The most interesting question, though, seems to be: how did Erased of all anime become so hyped? Think about the most notorious titles of recent years that can be considered overhyped: Attack on Titan was a shounen with focus in drama and a high body count, with an overall gritty setting and story; Kill la Kill was a self-aware ride of nonsensical action with very little restraint; One Punch Man was a parody of superhero tropes centered around fast-paced action and comedy. To think that a slow-paced thriller like Erased, with such an emphasis in children interacting and very little action, would become the hit of the season is a very surprising event. \\n\\n\r\nI must admit that I somewhat enjoyed the polemic surrounding the anime, not so much for how it affected the show itself in the public eye, but because it rings specially close to one of my personal beliefs: fixation on scores is bullshit! People going crazy over one title\u2019s score seemed ludicrous and drove the discussion away from the important elements by turning it into an exercise in group-think. Now you had to rate the show a certain way so that your opinion could be taken seriously by certain sections of the anime community. Now, however, the fires of the flame wars are on the rout to be tamed, so I thought it would be a good idea to offer my perspective on the anime, hoping that it can invoke some respect around.\\n\\n\r\nSince this is the section of the review I leave (specially) dedicated to self-indulgence, I\u2019d like to talk about specific details about Erased that I really like: I like Satoru\u2019s interactions with his mom as a child, showcasing that he still cared for her, even with the distance between them in his adult self; I like his interactions with his friends, both as a child and as an adult, when we can see the contrast their relationship takes; I like the lack of control Satoru has when talking as a child, showing the disconnect between his body and his mind; I like the meaning the title takes at the end of the series; I like the whimsical moments between Satoru and Hinazuki, which really drove home the meaning of his actions even at short term; I like the childishly awesome lines Satoru\u2019s friends said; I like when he reads the text he had written as  child, about his favorite hero; I like it, simple as that. \\n\\n\r\nWith this review I don\u2019t aim to change people\u2019s opinions or scores about Erased (although if it leads more people to give the show a try it would be really cool!), I hope simply to showcase how this opinion in specific can be valid, because as minimalistic of a story as it was, it did something for me, and for that I appreciate it.",

            "content": "With any established community there are traditions that take fruition from within it. And when it comes to the anime community that tradition can be seen with the ritualistic assignment of labels that is accompanied with every new seasonal lineup. Each season's catalog is cherry-picked through by the ascending masses to be filed away in neat little categories that're decided by whatever the common consensus is at that time. And it's thanks to this unspoken system that we get our \"anime of the season,\" \"hidden gems\" and \"BURN WITH FIRE\" shows that, for the most part, seems to be what the general audience agree upon.But among these rank-and-filed titles, we always have at least one show that splits the community into opposing camps; with one side exalting it as the next best thing since sliced bread and the other side wanting its head on a stick. These contentious titles ignite the embers of flame wars across several forums and opens the floodgates for keyboard warriors to caps lock the hell out of each other. These are often the most \"hyped\" show for that given season and tend to remain that way long after its airtime. Ladies and gentlemen, Boku dake ga Inai Machi (or Erased) is without question that title for Winter 2016. \\n\\n\r\nIf I was to give a very brief overview of Erased it would be this: engaging 1st half, deplorable 2nd half. \\n\\n\r\nErased is the type of show that will get under many peoples' skins. There are titles, that upon a 1st glance, you could easily deduce that it will be no better than B-grade schlock, and then there's shows that genuinely get your interest. For most, Erased will be the latter. With a somewhat firm grasp on cinematography, color placement and all around competency in crafting a grounded setting, Erased upon initial viewing, appeared to be one of the most promising prospects from Winter 2016. It exuded this feeling of self-control over its actions that became quite easy to buy into. A reassuring appearance that it will be a smooth ride from start to finish. The reason these kind of titles are more bothersome as opposed to the shows that are instantly identified as bottom-rung, is that with lesser tier titles, there's no expectations set for it. When I view an \"Akame Ga Kill\" or \"Asterisk War\" level show, quality is the last thing that comes to mind. I know as a viewer that what I'm getting ready to watch will, at its very best, be easily digestible excerpts of things I've seen done far better. On the other hand, shows that allure me into anticipating something far more substantial carries with it a higher sense of investment. So when these titles fall under their own weight, it packs a bigger punch. As a viewer, there's nothing more disheartening to witness than untapped potential being flushed down the toilet. And like its namesake, Erased \"erased\" any chances of being herald as anything more than a novelty act. \\n\\n\r\nInstead of reciting the synopsis I'll go right into addressing where Erased showed commendable effort and how it eventually unraveled into a hokey hogwash. \\n\\n\r\nTime-travel as a plot device in any story can be a fickle thing to work with, the slightest overuse or tampering of it to alleviate inevitable conclusions can quickly result in audience backlash with the collective chant of \"bullshit!\" being ushered out in response. The best use of time-travel is really not using time-travel at all but there's a reason why it's still a compelling tool for writers to dabble with. It can open up scenarios and prospects that previously were made unavailable in the conventions of regular stories. So the reasonable solution for those instances is finding restraint in when and how time-travel is used in the confines of the narrative being presented. This was an area that Erased seemed to have covered relativity well. The main character can jump back in time a few minutes before something tragic happened, as stated by the synopsis. What made this use of time-travel welcoming was that despite this ability, he himself has no true control over these time jump occurrences; the option to jump at will is out of his hands. With this stipulation set in place, Erased found a reasonable limitation to work with. It eliminated the misuse of time-travel by the protagonist to retcon any events whenever the writer sees fit. But as you may have surmised by my statements regarding this show's 2nd half, this established restraint doesn't remain constant, and that spells the first major misstep of the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe second major catalyst that crippled Erased was its genre itself. Marketed as a mystery anime, Erased spent a great deal of time foraging through its settings and characters living in it. This is what indirectly set up the first half to seem so promising. There were layers of detail being caked onto the \"mystery\" story, which helps to better define it to the audience. Erased felt like a place not too far out of reach from our own world, thanks in no small part to the extra time dedicated to making the experience as cinematic as possible. With widescreen angles (Letterboxing) implemented in certain crucial moments, to off-kilter camera angles that helped express messages without the need for expository dialogue, everything the show was doing up to a certain point showed a level of quality not often seen in the anime industry. It was able to build suspense using music cues and proper lighting, giving life to its mystery through comprehensible visual motifs and proper use of color placement. The show expressed capabilities far more common in the world of cinema than what anime usually dabbles with. It's for reasons like these that many flocked to it, labeling it as one of the best without so much as to second guess their stance. And ultimately it's this that also fended off proper judgment for the far inferior 2nd half. The frenzy was too high for rationality to kick in. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the quality of the show's visual and audible presentation remained relatively consistent, the same could not be said about the writing. When I mentioned the show's genre being a detriment, this is where that becomes apparent. With the primary genre being \"mystery,\" one would think a great deal of time would be dedicated to making that aspect as foolproof as possible, but what we got was nothing short of underwhelming. To those unfamiliar with the purpose of a 'red herring' in a story, it's something or someone that's manifested and exists for the purpose of misleading the viewer from the truth. It's like the slight of hand trick practiced by a magician, while the real action is happening out of sight. A red herring isn't supposed to be your answer but rather a falsehood that takes on the shape of an answer. In a mystery story, red herrings are those clues that lead to a dead end, or the suspects surrounding the true culprit that detracts the viewer from the correct answer. At no time is a red herring suppose to be a final conclusion. Even when there is an attempt to subvert this fact, all that does is make what appears to be the \"truth\" to be nothing more than another red herring in disguise. So when Erased effectively missed this fundamental fact, it is nothing short of baffling. \\n\r\nIn what was an attempt to curve the obvious fake out into the actual truth, Erased single-handily shot itself in the foot. These are the actions of a satire that pokes fun of the genre, not a show that is a part of it, which made the mystery of Erased to be an unintentional joke to those keen to this fact and an underwhelming reveal to those still infatuated with the show up to that point. No one walks out a winner, both cynics and fans alike lose in this situation. Had Erased place in some kind of deviation from the elephant in the room this wouldn't be a problem but poor planning sadly killed those chances. This anime was one script revision away from being passable. \\n\\n\r\nEven if one was to view the show as a thriller (a very common excuse used by detractors that stand against the title's criticisms), it still doesn't hold much merit. A thriller, like its namesake would imply, is a genre that's supposed to \"thrill\" the audience with an exciting, often intense plot, where the tension feels ever-present and a sense of urgency is placed on the viewer for the character's well-being. It's wound up dread followed by cathartic release. A very textbook component that's the backbone of any successful thriller. That being said, it's hard to be \"thrilled\" when the narrative makes irrational decisions that quickly breaks immersion, or deflate any tension that was built up with an anticlimactic conclusion. You're supposed to be in a state of nervous anticipation as to the outcome of a storyline, not scratching your head questioning the leaps in logic of said outcome. If a convenient ticket out of every impending danger is offered to the characters, then how could their predicament be anything short of a temporary bump in the road? Without a proper end result to any build-up, the show is essentially leaving you mentally flaccid. When a show continuously makes decisions that negate risk or impending danger, then it ceases to lack consequence in the eyes of the viewer. A thriller with no substantial consequence is like a mystery with no red herrings; and wouldn't you know it, Erased ended up being insufficient in both aspects.\\n\\n\r\nThis half-baked writing also seeped its way into the visual presentation, as the show's ineptitude in handling its symbolism and motifs became quickly apparent. What is important to note is the proper usage of these elements in a story and not the actual meaning of said elements. In any form of grounded storytelling, symbolism and motifs are suppose to be implemented with finesse. They're placed there to add subtext to what is being presented at face value. They're things that don't necessarily need to be identified to properly understand what you're watching, but upon analytical inspection, adds a new layer of meaning to what is presented on screen or implied in the narrative. To put it in layman's terms, they're like brownie points for those that dig deeper into the subject matter they're presented with. That being said, when these literary devices are spoon fed to the audience, it defeats the purpose of their usage. At that point, it's no longer a praiseworthy effort, but something that's equally detestable with the likes of lazily implemented expository dialogue. It's the difference between letting the visuals and action speak for themselves, oppose to beating the audience over the head with the obvious answer (Yes MothersBasement, red = danger.. In other news, cows go moo). Something being symbolic doesn't inherently make it good, an aspect that Erased failed to comprehend. \\n\\n\r\nAnd like a snowball effect, all these shortcomings kept on culminating into something far too glaring to be rectified. This brings us to the conclusion of the plot in the show's 1st half, which saw our protagonist Satoru muster everything in his power to protect Kayo. All of the show's efforts were slowly crafted around this plot. It was a gradual buildup to Kayo's revelation in the story. This brought with it the show's best efforts. Viewers were swayed into investing in this conflict, which became more gripping by each new episode. \"Will Satoru finally save her?\" \"Would his efforts be in vain?\"; these and many more questions were raised along with the stakes as things drew closer to its final destination. And after all the layers of suspense, all that attachment, all that investing... the conclusion quickly deflated in value by a poorly-realized, rushed solution that saw a character be re-written and patronized, while simultaneously removing one of the central focuses from the story entirely. So when one of the biggest investments for many viewers were removed from the equation, all these aforementioned issues that were initially dismissed, no longer had anything to hide behind. The shit was out in the open, it was just a matter of stepping back to finally realize it.\\n\\n\r\nIf I had to say what the biggest issue with Erased was it would be that all of the great aspects of it, all of the promises it made, and all of the standards that it set, was quickly counteracted by the occurrence of everything in the 2nd half. While the same issues were also there in the 1st act, it was never made apparent when the show pulled focus away from it. For every high point that Erased offered, an equally appalling low point balanced it out. It was a duality that kept it from being any better than where it ultimately ended up in the end.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nFor the first 6 episodes or so Erased was quite the enjoyable experience. I was invested in the conflict, I wanted to see the protagonist succeed, as well as uncover the mystery surrounding the killer. The show had my interest. But just as quickly as it drew me in, it lost me with the same speed. The 2nd half of Erased is nothing short of painfully mediocre to intellectually insulting. It was disappointing to see what it could have been, and how it turned out instead.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nErased could have been great, what it did well it did exceedingly well, the potential was there in ample proportions. But almost like a countermeasure, when it faltered it didn't just trip a little before catching itself, no, when it fumbled, it pretty much fell down a flight of stairs, breaking every bone on its way down. So do I recommend Erased even with acknowledgment of this? Yes, I do. Despite what trouble it had, later on, the 1st half was enjoyable enough to still warrant giving it a try. You may not like the end result but there's enough inherent value here for the 12 episodes to be worth going through for yourself.",

            "content": "Ever felt like you made a big mistake in life and wanted to fix it? Or perhaps you just want things to go in the right direction if given another chance? Most people will never get that sort of opportunity. But for a guy named Satoru Fujinuma, that\u2019s another story. His ability, Revival is pretty much a gift that allows him to travel back in time with his memories. So in essence, the guy can basically fix mistakes in his life with a second opportunity. Actually, I should probably rephrase that. What he has isn\u2019t just a gift but also a responsibility. The ability totime travel is an extraordinary power but it also comes with a lot of responsibility because in this story, Satoru has an encounter with a very experienced killer that puts him, his friends, and family at risk.\\n\\n\r\nBased on the manga, Boku dake Ini Machi (also known as Erased) is a psychological thriller. Adapted by A-1 Pictures, the series chronicles Satoru\u2019s life and his responsibilities to avert certain events. From the first episode, we see that he is a rather cynical man who seems indifferent about every day events except when there\u2019s some sort of oddity or strange event happening. As one of these events, Satoru encounters a bizarre instance when an unknown man emerges from his neighborhood. This apparently has connections with a series of murders in his community that also includes the death of a family member. I guess it\u2019s easy to tell what comes next as Satoru uses his Revival ability to avert such a tragedy. The problem? The unknown man/killer is very experienced so it takes much more than just time travel to prevent such a tragedy.\\n\\n\r\nNow I have to admit, this series has quite an intriguing premise. The idea of being able to witness events again and being able to fix them sets up a lot of plot planning for Satoru. The first few episodes establishes this as we see how events are constructed based on memories and narratives. What\u2019s interesting to see is how Satoru sees his own past. It\u2019s noticeable because of how the past relationship he shares with his mother is a bit different from the one we see in the future. In essence, Satoru begins to realize how happy he was and attempts to forge a stronger relationship with his mother. This is sharp contrast to Kayo Hinazuki, a lonely girl in the past timeline. Kayo\u2019s mother is the antithesis of a good parent. She is manipulative, abusive, foul mouthed, and treats her daughter like her property. Furthermore, her role in the story seems to be influence Kayo\u2019s personality as she becomes like a hollow shell. Of course, that does change once Satoru appears in her life. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the stronger dynamics of the series is the relationship and chemistry between certain characters. Besides Satoru and his mother, Satoru and Kayo easily has the most prominent relationship. From strangers to allies to friends, the two builds trust and a tight connection. At first, it\u2019s not easy because of how other students in the class also ostracizes Kayo. However, Satoru is able to break down her barrier of solitude. This is achieved by standing up to her bullies, treating her with kindness, and even confronting Kayo\u2019s mother as a way to show her wrongful deeds. In essence, this naturally allows Kayo to open up more and show her own cheerful side. At times, it\u2019s easy to see that Kayo\u2019s personality seems to be a bit of a reflection of Satoru in the future timeline. This also brings out Satoru\u2019s character as he realizes his own weakness at times as he feels powerless to stop certain events from time to time. \\n\\n\r\nAnother one of Satoru\u2019s important relationships is the one he shares with his friends, most importantly Kenya. Despite being a supporting character, he helps Satoru and is able to deduce certain abnormalities with his cunning mind. His strong sense of justice also inspires Satoru to stop crimes from happening especially to find the crafty killer in both the past and present. Despite this, I do think some relationships suffers. Satoru and Airi\u2019s relationship in the show is less noticeable and seems to be only based on trust. While it share similarity with Satoru/Kayo, it doesn\u2019t have the amount of emotional appeal. Even during one scenario where Airi\u2019s life is in danger, it feels like the show doesn\u2019t really appeal more than just the typical \u201cSatoru jumps in to save the day\u201d. Similarly, Satoru\u2019s relationship with his teacher is also based on trust as he seems to be one of the few adults that he can rely on. In essence, trust is a controversial part of the series as well because in the end, events that happens in the story isn\u2019t always what they seem.\\n\\n\r\nBy the time you\u2019ve watched 1/3 of the show, it\u2019s easy to tell that the series is very story centric. Every episode builds on more and more with the construction of events, the descriptive narratives from Satoru\u2019s point of view, and how important events influence one another. Satoru\u2019s revival ability creates opportunities, not just for himself but others too. Unfortunately, the killer is also a very crafty individual so they often plan ahead to strategically carry out their goals. This leads to Satoru\u2019s trouble with the law as he finds himself powerless at times. This is one of the weaknesses of the series. Satoru\u2019s motivation is to save certain people but he is sometimes unable to save himself. The weakness here is that we may feel that Satoru relies too much on himself rather than others, at least for a good portion of the story. Remember, Satoru only has the pieces of the past that he sees clearly but not always the solutions. Speaking of story, the show is also a bit predictable. Despite being labeled as a thrilling mystery, it\u2019s not difficult to predict who the killer is. On the other hand, there\u2019s also the idea about the motives. It will get the viewers to ask why certain people acts according to their actions. This includes Kayo\u2019s parents, friends, and obviously the killer himself. Also on a technical note, the series is only adapted into a 1-cour so expect a compressed adaptation. There are certain events that is omitted from the manga to speed up the pace while trying to keep the story as credible as possible. \\n\\n\r\nOn the visual front, the series has some pretty good quality. There\u2019s a lot of foreshadowing so the show is able to carefully piece together with clever camera angles, in particular with the moving framework. Even the show itself presents itself like a movie cinema, which is a reason why I\u2019d recommend watching the show on a big screen. In addition, character designs are very stellar to create the thrilling mood. The atmospheric feel of the show is delivered by the character expressions to show their personalities from the compassionate mother Sachiko, stoic Kayo, or the casual friend Airi. The killer is the also most noticeable in the show with his red eyes to reflect his dark twisted desires. Another character that stand out part is Sachiko with her signature lips, a distinctive way to show her as a prominent adult in the series.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack is another strong dynamic of the series. Yuki Kaijura helms the series composition and is fairly well known for her ability to create a thrilling atmosphere. This is accomplished by the fine details of eerie music especially during suspenseful scenes. Furthermore, there\u2019s the OP and ED theme songs with not just foreshadowing but also elements of mystery. Another noticeable part about the show is the character voices. Now obviously, there\u2019s a sharp contrast in voice tone between Satoru\u2019s present and future self because of the age gap. However, the praise should go to Shinnosuke Mitsushima, a newcomer with his ability to portray Satoru. \\n\\n\r\nBoku dake ga Inai Machi is far from a masterpiece. The story is predictable and despite a good amount of characterization, certain characters can be easily forgettable. Furthermore, time travel isn\u2019t a new concept as series such as Steins;Gate, The Girl Who Leapt Through Time, and even Zetusen no Tempest has dived into such themes. However, it\u2019s still a thrilling series mostly with how it keeps the audience at their seat. We want to see Satoru succeed and each episode builds more and more on that. The relationship dynamics remains one of the most prominent concepts of the series and it easily brings the story to life. From the past to the present, it shows how characters progress with fine details through storytelling. And speaking of fine details, the production team really did put a good amount of effort in the visual quality and soundtrack. As for a show like this, it\u2019s about embracing the story and see what it has to offer. If you\u2019re a fan of that, then there\u2019s a lot to look into to.",

As long as the factor of time continues being the apex predator of the universe, the inevitable decay of all pain and memory is unstoppable.\" - Overpriced Mac computer\r\nIn the beginning of 2016 an anime with an absurd rating  popped out of nowhere on Mal's top list.That anime was ofcoarse Boku dake ga Inai Machi.Being the tea-drinking gentleman that i am,i've disregarded it as the Oscars did with Edward Norton,but lately i've mustered some fate in humanity and decided to give the short 12 episode mystery a chance.\r\nThe story centers arounda 29 year old pizzaman (sadly that is not Kenji the Enji) trying to become mangaka,while also having convenient time traveling powers given to him by the Magical Space Jesus,that only work when they are needed for the plot.\\n\r\nOne day,while driving his fancy pizzamobile,he sees a speeding vehicle going towards a little kid and much like a certain protagonist from Yu Yu Hakusho he decides to be the hero.While managing to save the kid he also ends up being in a hospital.After being released his mom decides to live with him and on the next day in his absence  she gets stabbed to death by a shady looking character wearing fedora.When he returns and finds her body some woman conveniently sees him and calls police.The police  then assumes him as the prime suspect,but instead of clearing his name,he runs away from them,using his inexplicable time traveling powers given to him by the Magical Space Jesus to go back in time,precisely 18 years ago and find and prevent the killer from killing his mother.But to do so by his logic he must become someone else,he must become something else.That something is his 11 year old self,By doing that he assumes that if he prevents the kidnapping of a classmate of his - Kayo,he will exculpate his friend who was originally framed for the kidnapping and sentenced to death,leaving the real perpetrator free to kill his mom in the future.So he decides to get friendly with her until the day of her kidnapping,giving a weird uncomfortable pedo vibe.\\n\r\nBut the thing is,it really didn't matter which kid would the killed choose to as his victim.Making the entire effort pointless if the wasn't convenient for the plot the killer to be someone that Satoru knows from 18 years ago.\\n\r\nAnother thing thing i want to mention is that the emotional scenes in this particular \"gem\" are probably the worse i've seen in just about anything.I've laughed in every single supposed sad scene there was.\\n\\n\r\nCharacterization is probably the biggest flaw in Boku dake ga Inai Machi. The characters are irritating, flat, inconsistent, contrived, and they alone destroy any possibility of this being even a decent anime..\\n\r\nEvery single one of them is a bland plot device which acts anyway the plot wants them to act and without a doubt will be forgotten in the next 2 months or so.You really can't tell which one is worse or best since they all suck.\\n\r\nBut ofcoarse then most noticable one is the one with the most screen time.That ofcoarse is Satoru.He makes really illogical actions in just about every episode.\\n\r\nThe other main character for the majority of the series is Kayo.For the sake of shock factor,she is abused by her one dimentional evil mother, a fact which all the adults around her are aware of,but are unable to do anything about. Child Protective services had attempted to deal with the situation but were unable to gain any concrete proof or even set up a meeting.\\n\r\nDue to this abuse, she's a social outcast at school, preferring to distance herself from other people, hoping that if she wears the mask of apathy long enough, it will become real. After school, she spends her time mostly alone at a local park until 6 P.M., to avoid going home and facing her mother.\\n\r\nThe killer is an absolute copy of Mark Jefferson,except that his plans make no sense at all and unlike the charismatic Life is Strange villain,he is very predictable and his motivations are non-existent.\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters's personalities can be deducted from their character designs alone.It was like they weren't real life people, with their own mindsets and ideas.\\n\r\nAlthough the ending wasn't bad,although extremely cheese and predictable,because of the poor character development it didn't manage to become paramount.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation as avarage as it gets for this damn age !Nothing more to be said.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was as bland as the characters which in this case is a good thing.\\n\r\nThe ost was pretty meh.It didn't make my ears bleed nor did it impress me,so it's between avarage and fine.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough having avarage Sound and avarage animation,this anime had MAJOR phasing problem,rushing until the very end,failing to emotionally connect the viewer to the characters and some''genius'' mind though using monologues to the point of beating a dead horse.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nBoku dake ga Inai Machi is one of the dumbest show to ever take itself seriously. It is essentially a hackneyed amalgamation of cliches and overused plot devices that clumsily attempts to disguise itself as something greater.\\n\r\nWatch Boku dake ga Inai Machi if you have a weird Deus ex Machina fetish, but otherwise stay away. It does nothing new and it does nothing well. It doesn\u2019t even fail in an interesting or original way, destroying any chance for campy \"so-bad-it's-good\" appeal. As a result, I can't think of a single positive thing to say about it, and I have no choice but to give it a 2. \\n\\n\r\nMoral of this is.....\\n\r\nIt's time to stop!It's time to stop!Ok?No more!Where are your parents!?Who are your parents ?I'm gonna call Child Protective services!It's time to stop !\\n\\n\r\nFor some actually good anime that revolves around Time travel i point you not towards Steins;Gate,because chances are that you've already watched it,but towards Noein.Not one of my personal favourites tho,but it did everything that Boku dake ga Inai Machi failed to do with flying colours.Even Crispin Freeman is in it.Who doesn't like Crispin Freeman ?Nobody!",

            "content": "Erased follows Satoru, a jaded pizza boy and struggling manga artist who plays vigilante after connecting a string of murders that took place during his childhood. Like all pizza boys, Satoru is burdened with the ability to time travel, an ability which automatically activates whenever someone in his immediate vicinity is nearing fatal danger, allowing him to save lives.\r\nIt's established within the first episode that this is an ability that lets him travel 1-5 minutes into the past to prevent something bad from happening, yet, when he comes home to find that his mother has been murdered and the unknown assailant has set him upby calling the police and promptly leaving the crime scene, this ability triggers Satoru to travel back into the body of his 8 year old self for reasons the show never explains.\\n\r\nOf course, this show's advocates would probably argue that in this particular incident his life was in danger so the rule established in the first place doesn't necessarily apply to the situation- but then, a few episodes later, Satoru, now using the opportunity he's been bestowed with to prevent tragedies which he had previously been unable to, namely the murder of a little girl called Hinazuki Kayo, sees what he believes to be another her blooded clothes tied up into a bag after her disappearance, and then proceeds to run away yelling at the top of his lungs, travelling back to present day where he is being tailed by the police despite being in no immediate danger. \\n\r\nA few more episodes in, Satoru then time travels back to being a child again while he's being arrested for the murder he was framed for, because he tried really hard I guess.\\n\r\nBy refusing to establish boundaries for this ability, the writer allows himself  to cop out of any situation and in the process removes all the tension the show would otherwise have had, a painfully clear way of forcing plot progression when the writer shoots himself in the foot.\\n\\n\r\nDespite this, the show garnered quick attention as flavour of the month for the spring 2016 season, and was praised by many for its cliffhangers, the same things that are rendered completely inconsequential due to what is arguably the show's central element of the \"revival\". This isn't just removing the stakes, it's completely fucking obliterating them; if you look through the episodes that have cliffhangers, it's not long before a pattern emerges either.\\n\r\nIn episode 1, Satoru is framed for the murder of his mother and met by the police before experiencing what we can assume is his first revival of more than 5 minutes.\\n\r\nEpisode 4 has kid-satoru walk into class to find that Hinazuki has gone missing.\\n\r\nEpisode 5 has one of Satoru's coworkers trap herself, after opening a door to a room that is clearly on fire because plot, and faint.\\n\r\nBy the end of episode 6, Satoru is back in present day and gets arrested for the suspected murder of his mother.\\n\r\nAnd in episode 7, the show teases that the murderer is about to find Hinazuki again.\\n\r\nAfter the murderer is revealed in episode 10, Satoru is left drowning in ice cold water (oh shit dude how's he going to get his way out of this one)\\n\\n\r\nAll of these \"cliffhangers\" are solved with he flick of a switch once the protagonist time travels, and have no long term consequences whatsoever.\\n\r\nIn most Mystery/Thriller shows, or just any show that is trying to create dramatic tension in general, you'd expect the creators to have a certain amount of tricks up their sleeve to play around with as the show progresses, usually through withholding or teasing certain pieces of information and then revealing them later down the line. Erased doesn't just do this poorly, it barely has the initial tools to do this to begin with, which is why it has to rely on cheap cliffhangers that, beyond their immediate shock factor mean n-o-t-h-i-n-g with the presence of the revival.\\n\\n\r\nEven ignoring the writing crime that is the \"revival\", the mystery itself has little to offer at least as far as guesswork is concerned, it's frustratingly obvious that the killer is the teacher- when I first saw the teacher tap Satoru on the back and the camera panned up to his towering body as he glared at Satoru with a smirk on his face and red-tinted eyes it was such an unsubtle way of implying he was the bad guy that I thought that he HAD to be a red herring, but nope, he's the baddy. It's not like the show makes any effort to conceal the fact he's the killer either, with him being one of only two adult male characters that get any significant screen time in the revival episodes, the other of which has long blonde hair and looks nothing like the killer in the short glimpse we get of him in the first episode.\\n\r\nSome people would argue that it's about the \"why\" and not the \"who\", and that this may have even been the show's intention, but then I'd have to ask, why can't it be both?\\n\r\nI'm not suggesting that the show needed a ridiculous number of red herrings, that too would get obnoxious after a while, but I don't think it's wrong to expect at least ONE scene, one line of dialogue, one piece of information, one character to throw us off the tracks of the killer.\\n\r\nEven the creator himself when interviewed said he sees the show as \"a human drama disguised as a suspense thriller\", suggesting he did in fact intend for it to be obvious that the killer was the teacher.\\n\r\nBut then again, this is the same director that said his two favourite things about the show are its \"suspense\" and \"scenes that make you think Kayo is cute\", so I take that statement with a pinch of salt.\\n\r\nIt's not like the killer's motivation is particularly interesting either, the show briefly touches on his childhood and some story about him killing hamsters, but little else is done to help with the pay off for our all important \"why\". \\n\\n\r\nIf the intention was to make the killer's identity obvious, then why did they give him such a flat backstory and barely explore his character? I get that it's supposed to be ironic that Satoru was next to the killer all along- but dramatic irony can't carry the show on its own whether you consider it to be a mystery or not, the teacher doesn't get nearly enough focus, his motivation was clich\u00e9 and his method of killing victims was boring, his character was inconsistent, meandering between intelligent and idiotic, and some still claim that \"this was the point\".\\n\\n\r\nHaving returned to his childhood for the second time in the show, Satoru now approaches the situation from a different angle and begins to take more of an active role in protecting Hinazuki and discovering the identity of the killer, successfully saving her by ensuring she in the custody of her Grandma after exposing her parents as abusive, because apparently that would stop the killer from targeting her, even though, if anything, having an elderly woman as her only direct form of protection would make it easier for the killer to target her. It's clearly implied ol' teach is seemingly indiscriminate with the kids he kills, his only criteria being that they have a spider thread on their head, which we can assume is a delusion, a twisted way of rationalising his actions, so why wouldn't the teacher continue to pursue Kayo? He's her teacher for fuck's sake he's like the one person outside of the  people who relocated her that would still have access to her information.\\n\\n\r\nWhich brings me to the next glaring issue, how are any of Satoru's actions helping with the situation at hand? Sure he's ensuring the three victims the killer originally targeted are safe leading up to the date they originally died, but that isn't going to stop teach from going after them at a later date, or even other children, in fact, the show doesn't try to hide this, there's even a few short scenes where we see him trying to target another girl outside of the three Satoru knows died in his timeline.\\n\r\nIf that wasn't ridiculous enough, after a few shenanigans with some of the non-Kayo children that Satoru tries to save, the teacher catches on to Satoru and straight-up drowns him by strapping him into a car with a seatbelt (genius) and rolling the car into a freezing lake with a basketball after convincing him to get into his car to find a girl that was missing when in actuality she wasn't.\\n\r\nThis far into the show, the natural assumption would be that Satoru would  time travel back into the future, but I guess even the writer was tired of the plot device, because with no explanation whatsoever, Satoru goes into a coma and wakes up fifteen years later. (so pretty much a revival but with the added drama of amnesia) \\n\r\nBut what about the car? Satoru was drowning in freezing water, who saved him? The teacher was the only one there, did he save him? If so why? If not who did? And how did they get to Satoru in time to save him while still providing enough time for the killer to escape? A character claims in the final episode that there was \"no evidence\", why was there no evidence? We're told by the teacher that he has multiple cars- but they all look the same, does no one in the show pick up on that after Satoru goes into the coma? What about eyewitnesses, did no one see them leave in the car together? Something tells me the show doesn't know the answer to any of these questions.\\n\\n\r\nWith such a ridiculously vague way of concluding the \"revival\" scenes, I'm gonna spitball and say that the writer realised that, should he have Satoru escape with a \"revival\", Satoru wouldn't have protected any of the children in the first place, and the story would be back to square one- so the chances are he realised there were only two ways to avoid this dead end; either have Satoru somehow escape the killer and live out the rest of those 15 years to get the show back into present day, or get there nice and quick by shoving him in a coma, and the latter is infinitely easier to \"pull off\" and has infinitely more \"thrilling moments\" to be pulled out of its ass, so naturally that was the choice.\\n\r\nIt's one thing to assume that the killer wouldn't target other children during the revival scenes, but now we're supposed to believe that 15 years have passed and he hasn't been busted for the attempted murder of Satoru? I guess the show also wants you to deny the idea that the teacher would have killed anyone else during this long stretch of time, although it does make sure to throw in the implication that he's grooming a little girl leukemia patient.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, with Satoru having regained his memories, the final confrontation begins and teach takes a wheelchair-bound Satoru up to the roof of the hospital they are in.\\n\r\nTeach is shown to have every intention to kill Satoru, even going as far as to send a fake suicide message to Satoru's mother; but then Satoru catches him off guard by wheeling himself to the edge of the roof, threatening to kill himself, prompting the teacher to confront the possibility that he'd never wanted to live without Satoru in the first place.\\n\r\nI guess the idea was that he'd started fixating on Satoru somewhere down the line and decided he couldn't live without him. That's not really a problem in itself, I can dig a good crazy character, a quality love/hate relationship between an antagonist and the protagonist, but every scene up until this point had pointed towards the idea that this man was every bit as calculating as he was cold, this slowly deteriorates towards the end when he starts reciting his \"evil plans\" to Satoru on their way to the lake, but It's the nail in the coffin to have this guy who seemed to have his hand in all the pies go on to fuck up so badly. Not to mention it's barely tangible with his character.\\n\\n\r\nTo add insult to injury, the entirety of this shoddily realised premise is the result of the pure coincidence that Satoru's mother happened to notice the murderer in the act of abducting a little girl, not the protagonist, not intentionally, but the unintentional observation of a side character that dies in the SAME EPISODE (although admittedly she gets a little more screen time after this due to the time travel).\\n\\n\r\nSurely it would have been far more solid of a concept to have the protagonist actively search for the killer (considering he begins to research into the matter after remembering the incident in his childhood anyway), and then have HIM discover the murderer abducting a child, have the murderer notice HIM observing his actions, and then have the murderer go to his house to kill him, only to find the mother there alone instead because Satoru was still at the pizza store and kill her instead. Not only would this solve the issue of the show's reliance on coincidence, but it would also have meant that when the MC found his mother dead on the floor and got caught by the police, his revival to his childhood could have instead focused on the fact that he knew the identity of the killer, but is near helpless to deal with them due to the limitations of being in a child's body and the fact that if he attempts to directly confront the killer, he would risk exposing himself, putting his and his mother's life in danger, and wasting the one chance he has to rekindle his relationship with his her.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10\\n\r\nBeyond his ability, Satoru isn't ground-breakingly interesting, but is at least to a certain extent a bit of a break from light novel guy #1000. The predominate focus of his character is his social anxiety and inability to express himself, and the idea of a make-or-break chance to re-evaluate his life, start fresh and show appreciation for those around him ties directly into these character traits- in fact, the idea of having his adult self engage with the environment he used to live in and people he used to know (ignoring the inevitable time travel issues) is actually rather clever- allowing the show to reveal characteristics of the adult Satoru (most notably through monologues) as he explores the environment along with the viewer, and then simultaneously communicating the characteristics of Satoru as a child through the way in which other characters respond to Satoru's mannerisms now that he's back in his younger body- which Satoru then picks up on and attempts to suppress, making for a dynamic that not only creates the perfect platform for non-intrusive world building and exposition as Satoru rediscovers details he would have either missed or forgotten from when he was a child, but (for lack of a better way of putting it) allows this sort of ricoshet between Satoru and other characters as we get a better look into both what he was like then and what he is like now, and how those changes in his personality effect his decisions.\\n\r\nUnfortunately, despite this interesting narrative tool, the show barely makes use of it- in fact, Satoru spends the majority of his time with characters he wasn't even acquainted with in his childhood, which seems pretty counter intuitive given the premise.\\n\\n\r\nHinazuki  lacks the standard of characterisation I'd hope to see in a female lead, but then again, she's only a kid; so there's a limit to how well explored she can be. Fortunately, the small amount of characterisation we do get for her is fairly solid with this in mind, she is introverted and self-contained as a result of her neglectful upbringing.\\n\\n\r\nThe relationship between Kayo and Satoru is confusing. At times, the show seems to want to develop her as a romantic interest in various scenes where they touch hands, go visit places and go on little dates together, but when the show addresses the fact that Satoru is actually a grown man who's demonstrating sexual and romantic interest in a child, it's simply used for comedic effect, despite having the potential to be one of the most interesting aspects of the show.\\n\\n\r\n(to the people who deny him being a paedophile, I'd encourage them to think about how, in one particular scene, he sat outside a bathroom staring at the door, listening to an 11 year old girl have a bath with his mother, gulping and blushing before shaking his head, turning away and reminding himself to \"get a grip\", totally not paedophilic.)\\n\\n\\n\r\nBut anyway, I digress- the concept of having a paedophile who isn't actually driven by their urges seems to be explored with Yuki, the teenager who is framed for the murder of the children, and is established as a paedophile. The show makes a point of making us aware of this, and yet also makes it clear that he's not a bad person, and the majority of his screen time actually portrays him as a fairly kind and compassionate person who is misunderstood by the public, and it's a shame he didn't get more screen time, because he's easily one of the better characters in the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe teacher is the character which struck me as having the most potential.\\n\r\nWhile some aspects of his character fall short, I was a big fan of the idea that he genuinely cared for Satoru, their relationship being akin to that of father and son, admittedly in a rather malformed way \"daddy and boo\", maybe.\\n\r\nOn paper it sounds a bit absurd, and while I'll admit that the way the show goes about explaining his actions isn't the best (I even said earlier that it wasn't tangible with his character), the idea itself was interesting enough to overshadow the fact that it may have not been communicated in the best way.\\n\r\nThe main reason why I feel like this idea actually works rather well is that the show, at no point, tries to ignore the fact that the teacher is screwed up, but rather explores the idea that he is simultaneously a kind person (in public) and detestable person (in private).\\n\r\nI think people naturally assume that because a character's a serial killer the way they act in public is a facade, but I feel like it's slightly more complicated than that.\\n\r\nThere's frequently stories of people who live perfectly normal, healthy lives; but unbeknownst to their family and friends, have urges to kill, urges they may even act upon at some point, so while it's admittedly contradictory, I feel like his character was written to genuinely enjoy teaching a class; if that wasn't the case, for what reason would the show even bother to address the fact that he was about to kill Satoru while he was in his coma, but decided NOT to, other than to suggest he is struggling with the side of him that wants to live a normal life and the side that wants to kill.\\n\r\nPart of me would even be inclined to say it justifies him not killing any other children in those 15 years, perhaps he IS the one who rescued Satoru from drowning, despite being the very person that drove him into the water (although the manga debunks this idea, I feel like I've started writing fanfiction here), it's far fetched, but fascinating nonetheless.\\n\r\nI won't deny that I'm completely contradicting myself here, it wasn't until I started writing the review that I started to think about the dynamic, so my thoughts on whether or not the teacher is a well written character are a bit jumbled, but honest to how I see the character nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nPizza girl who I can't remember the name of (not to be confused with pizza sauce imouto from Charlotte) comes across as a rather bland and uninspired character, and really only serves as a way of anchoring Satoru to the present day when he returns because plot.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps one of the more obvious reasons why this show got so popular in such a short space of time is just how confidently it goes about presenting itself, at no point does the show stop to question its mistakes and this is deeply rooted within the directory choices and art design, that it to say that, this show has been designed to heavily rely on its visuals to carry what is in actual fact a fairly poorly constructed narrative. From the letterboxing used in the revival scenes to imitate the rectangular format used in widescreen filming, to the visual symbolism and shot composition that, in complete contrast to what I've seen from the manga are at times fresh and completely upgrade scenes that would otherwise have little to no draw, complimenting the intended dramatic tension the anime strives for- this show clearly wants to catch the eye of the viewer with a bold and self-assured cinematic atmosphere characteristic of live-action, high budget movies.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs too, have been given a much needed upgrade, and at least from the few panels I've seen from the manga have a lot more personality to them, especially when considering this was produced by A-1 pictures, who in recent years have become notorious for having a lack of diversity with their character designs.\\n\\n\r\nIt's definitely a step in the right direction for A-1, but for every shot that spices up a scene, another comes along and provides equal mediocrity, and I can't shake the feeling that it would almost be better for the show to demonstrate none of this at all rather than occasionally show a spark of forethought.\\n\\n\r\nIgnoring that jarring sound effect that blasts your ears every time Satoru activates his \"revival\" or a fucking butterfly flies across the screen, the sound direction is sharp and consistent- the opening is orgasmic, it's been too long since we've had an Asian Kung-Fu Generation song in an anime, and similarly, the ending song is of high quality- being one of only the two songs performed by \"Sayuri\" for an anime (the first being for Ranpo Kitan).\\n\\n\r\nThe OST, by Yuki Kajiura, pulls from the same bag as her usual catalogue of stuff- serviceable to decent.\\n\r\nThe voice acting is fairly standard, with the exception of Kayo Hinazuki, voiced by Yuuki Aoi- who did a stellar job with the role of a kuudere, and Shinnosuke Mitsushima with his first role ever in an anime as Satoru, who's voice acting was so natural that at times it almost felt out of place next to the some of the more average performances, which felt pretty rigid when held up against his.\\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't call Erased terrible, in fact, I can completely understand why it garnered the attention it did. It's thrilling, ambitious and easy to get invested in for some- with a cinematic presentation that turns a passable concept into something that, for better or for worse, stands out from the crowd, but beneath all of these elements is a show that fails at the fundamentals, which crumbles from the ground up and tries to hide these issues by ignoring them completely, and no amount of visual polish can change that.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+Some great voice acting\\n\r\n+Cinematic visuals/directing\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Never make the butler the killer (or in this case the teacher)\\n\r\n-Time travel power that serves as a cheap plot device\\n\r\n-Seriously how the fuck does this power work\\n\r\n-Doesn't always fully take advantage on some of its more interesting ideas\\n\r\n-Ignores the killer's indiscriminate nature for the sake of wrapping things up in a neat little bow\\n\r\n-Poorly handles the theme of abuse, no commentary whatsoever\\n\r\n-Pizza girl's dad had his life fucked up because he stole a chocolate bar, pretty ironic given the ridiculous shit the killer gets away with.\\n\r\n-Ends with implying Satoru's manga is inspired by the events of the show, the editor remarking that it's going to be a huge success.\\n\r\nSomething about that seems a little too self indulgent/vain.\\n\r\n-The tsundere loli didn't get enough screen time.",

            "content": "**SPOILER FREE REVIEW**\r\nErased is a grippingly cinematic, but ultimately childish and half-baked attempt at an anime mystery drama that makes a mockery out of the serious themes it chooses to incorporate. However, that didn\u2019t seem to stop it from taking the anime world by storm and soaring into the top FIVE on the all time MAL rankings while it was still airing. Yikes. This show is clumsy, saturated in over-convenience, and excruciatingly awkward at times, but it\u2019s obvious that something about Erased really resonated with a lot of people. Let\u2019s find exactly what makes this show popular and, more importantly, where it all went wrong.\r\nSynopsis:Satoru Fujinuma, our protagonist, is a detached 29 year old Manga artist who possesses a special ability that he refers to as \u201cRevival\u201d, which causes him to be sent back in time several minutes before tragic accidents that occur in his general vicinity, whether he wants to or not. He will continue to be sent back in time until he stops the event in question from occurring. One day, tragedy strikes, but this time, Satoru is sent 18 whole years in the past. Soon, he realizes that the event he has to prevent is the abduction and killing of one of his classmates, the solitary and mysterious Kayo Hinazuki, which took place when he was a child. \\n\\n\r\nIf you couldn\u2019t tell right of the bat after reading the synopsis, Erased was playing with fire from the very beginning. The use of time resets as a plot device carries great power in the context of a story, and with great power comes great responsibility. The problem with time resets is that if you don\u2019t establish strict and appropriate rules and restrictions from the very beginning, it becomes nothing more than a transparently lazy deus ex machina whose properties bend and shape to the convenience of the plot. Nothing breaks immersion like some mystical superpower with no established boundaries that seamlessly drifts in and out of the plot for no discernible reason, only reappearing to solve otherwise unsolvable problems. This is a problem that Erased has, and it\u2019s one of the main things that make the story so impossible to take seriously. Satoru\u2019s \u201cRevival\u201d ability has absolutely no rules. It shows up for no logical reason, doesn\u2019t show up in situations where it did before, contradicts the very short and insufficient explanation we were given of it, and the story can\u2019t seem to decide if he has the ability to consciously trigger it or if he does not. It\u2019s madness. Utter chaos. The foundation of this anime\u2019s premise was so badly botched that it causes the world of Erased to come off as one that doesn\u2019t have any rules, and that is far and away its biggest failure as a mystery drama. I don\u2019t mean to suggest that Revival is the only aspect of this show that is overly convenient and lazy though; the anime is riddled with poor planning and lack of explanation. For example, people show up for no reason and out of nowhere at the best/worst possible moment on a consistent basis, like this is some sort of battle shounen. Erased\u2019s writing is a disaster, plain and simple.\\n\\n\r\nI could talk for a long time about the technical problems of Erased\u2019s storyline, but it commits a sin that is perhaps even more egregious: The bastardization of a mature theme. Namely, child abuse. If you are going to incorporate such a serious and heart-wrenching topic into your story, fine; just make sure that you treat it with the respect that it deserves. Unfortunately, Erased utterly fails to do that. Instead, it merely shoehorns it in as a cheap, lowest-common-denominator way of tugging at our heartstrings. Erased chooses to make us feel bad for its characters not by fleshing them out with personality, but by having them be graphically beaten on camera for reasons that are completely unnecessary to the plot. This edgy, shock-factor bullshit is what cemented my dislike of this show. This is the kind of thing that doesn\u2019t just impede my enjoyment of the anime, but makes me genuinely angry that the writers thought they could manipulate the emotions of the viewers so underhandedly. It\u2019s completely shameless, and they should be embarrassed.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s one more aspect of this show\u2019s plot that I can\u2019t resist mentioning... *Sigh\u2026  Hear me out on this one. Maybe this is just me, but the entire premise of this show is fucking CREEPY. Seriously. There are some shockingly blatant pedophilic undertones in Erased. There are multiple instances where the protagonist, WHO IS 29 YEARS OLD, gets obviously aroused by the thought of a relationship (or more\u2026) with Hinazuki, who is a child. If you think I\u2019m joking, there is scene in the latter half of the show where Hinazuki is taking a bath and Satoru overhears her from the other room. He then gets a flustered/uncomfortable, flushed look on his face and thinks to himself, and I quote, \u201cGet a hold of yourself. You\u2019re 29.\u201d WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT SHIT MAN???  That\u2019s not a one-time thing either! That is a reoccurring gag throughout the show! Who the HELL thought that would be a good idea?! Is this some sort of underground fetish show or something? Was it made for people who fantasize about fucking children while they are also in the body of a child? Nobody is ever going to convince me that Satoru\u2019s reoccurring and vague attraction to Hinazuki is not disturbing as hell. It makes my skin crawl, and more importantly, it makes the show even more impossible to take seriously. This is incorporating humor into your show GONE WRONG.\\n\\n\r\nAs bad as Erased\u2019s plot is, even shows with bad plots can often be redeemed if they have a strong cast of characters. Well, Erased doesn\u2019t have that. Not even close, in fact. Our protagonist, Satoru, is your standard white-knight archetype. If you don\u2019t know what that is, it\u2019s when a character is defined entirely by his desire to be morally righteous and help others. There is literally no other defining trait to this character whatsoever! The first episode makes it seem like they would make him deadpan or detached or, hell, SOMETHING in order to differentiate him, but no. Any individuality Satoru may have possessed in the first episode completely evaporates and is nowhere to be found from episode 2 and onwards. He\u2019s just a walking, talking robot who spurns the plot forward with his soulless, mechanically predictable actions. At no point, except maybe in the first episode, did I care about this character, and that is a certain way for a show to fail.\\n\\n\r\nNow let\u2019s talk about Satoru\u2019s love interest (Yes, I\u2019m calling her that. This show knows what it did), Kayo Hinazuki. Kayo is a character that is able to single-handedly exemplify so much of what is wrong with this show, in the sense that she is not a real character at all; she is a plot device, just like the rest of the cast. Her sole purpose is to be used as a literal whipping post just so that justice-kun can swoop in to be her knight in shining armor and pretend he doesn\u2019t want to get into those prepubescent pants. She is nothing more than an object the show utilizes to manipulate the emotions of the viewers; an artificially created victim who exists only to suffer some one-dimensional, interchangeable hardship rather than an actual character with a personality and interesting outlooks, dreams, or crises.  Erased is lazy, deceiving character writing at its finest.\\n\\n\r\nSo at this point, if you haven\u2019t watched Erased, you may be wondering that if everything I wrote in the above paragraphs is true, what is the appeal of this show? The answer, quite simply, is that the cinematography is very well executed and the directing is very engaging. The environments are always crisp and detailed, plus the shot composition is absolutely spot-on in most instances. There are notable exceptions, but I won\u2019t get into that. As for the directing, Erased presents information to the viewer in a very streamlined, matter of fact manner. Scenes intended to be connected are always spelled out to the viewer through the use of flashbacks, and lots of creative transition sequences are used with narrative accompaniment between scenes. I prefer when shows leave it up to the viewer to deduce certain things rather than being spoon-fed, but for what they were going for, they did a good job. Erased looks good, is animated dramatically, and is easy to digest. Those are the factors that lead to its massive popularity, and frankly, those are the only aspects of the show that can\u2019t be harshly criticized justifiably. \\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, Erased is just another overhyped anime written for edgy teens that uses cheap, manipulative tactics to emotionally affect the audience, fooling them into thinking it\u2019s a well-written show when it obviously isn\u2019t. It\u2019s immature, terribly inconsistent, the characters are soulless plot devices, and its laughable use of the ultimate anime clich\u00e9 \u201ctime resets\u201d is just the icing on the cake. Erased is a bad show with good animation, and sometimes, that\u2019s all a show needs to get popular.",

            "content": "Hype can be a fickle thing when it comes to seasonal anime. At first it allows fans to get excited and anxious for the next episode, but majority of the time it ends up with many feeling somewhat disappointed with what they had been watching. This can be attributed to the fact that only one episode is released per week, and this week-long wait between episodes is a breeding ground for die-hard fans to praise a show as one of the best anime after only having seen a couple episodes. You only have to see the \u2018Top Anime List\u2019 on MAL to see that wheneveryou\u2019re reading this, there\u2019s probably at least one show currently airing that snuck its way onto the list, only to slowly drop off once hype dies down and reality sets in. At one point I was a victim of this mentality, but now after experiencing disappointment as a result, I see hyping up a show like this as asinine, often leading to impairments in judgement. Erased, a Winter 2016 anime produced by A1 Pictures is one of the best examples of this: before the halfway point of its runtime, Erased had managed to capture the #4 spot on MAL\u2019s Top Anime List, a feat I have never seen any other weekly seasonal anime do. And as I am writing this it isn\u2019t even in the Top 50 anymore, with many of its top reviews being negative; truly a fall from grace. So, looking back at show over a year since it ended, here are my thoughts on Erased:\\n\\n\r\n*EDIT: SPOILERS ABOUND, BEWARE IF YOU LIVE UNDER A ROCK AND SOMEHOW HAVE NOT WATCHED THE SHOW YET*\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Erased follows Satoru Fujinuma, a struggling manga artist in his twenties living a rather dour life, having to work a pizza delivery day job to make ends meet. However, Satoru has a supernatural ability called \u2018Revival\u2019 that causes him to travel back through his own time, usually only by a couple minutes, allowing him to stop any accidents or disasters nearby. The catch is that Satoru\u2019s time-travel ability works out of his control, being the setup for the premise of Erased. By the end of the first episode Satoru finds his mother murdered at his house, and is quickly framed as the prime suspect. This chain of events causes Revival to activate, sending Satoru 18 years into the past and back to his 10-year-old child self. Seeing this as a sign, Satoru uses this opportunity to prevent the abduction and murder of three young students at the hands of a serial killer, starting with the first victim, Kayo Hinazuki. The premise alone is nothing special and somewhat contrived from the start, but the way it is presented through great visual direction along with setting up an important mystery element in the murderer/serial killer leaves viewers eager to see how things will unfold.\\n\\n\r\nEpisodes 2-4 are what I consider to be the highlight of the entire show. It\u2019s in these episodes where we see Satoru attempt to save Kayo\u2019s fate through befriending her when no one else would. Kayo is cold towards everyone due to domestic abuse from her mother and her overall troubled life at home, so it\u2019s no surprise that she does not care about Satoru\u2019s attempts at friendship initially, but Satoru remains committed and continues to pursue her. The process takes some time but she slowly opens up to Satoru and sees him more like a real friend as time goes on. The 4th episode also leaves us with a cliff-hanger regarding Kayo\u2019s safety; was Satoru successful in stopping Kayo\u2019s fate? Or was all his effort still not enough to change the past? The character interactions, atmosphere and overall direction all worked well here, drawing more viewers into the world, the relationship between the two leads and Satoru\u2019s goal. The supporting characters also get some shine on screen, with Satoru\u2019s mother Sachiko and his teacher Gaku slowly getting more involved in the main plotline, as well as his friend Kenya who seemed to know more about the story than what a boy his age should have. Characters still need more development, questions still need answering and they could use some more exploration overall but from the great setup so far, it\u2019s not surprising that fans were excited for the series and what would happen next. Sadly, this was the highlight of the show, meaning what would happen next would be when the series starts to fall.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s revealed in episode 5 that Kayo did in fact go missing, and Satoru having failed to change the past is brought back to his own time, still under suspicion of Sachiko\u2019s murder and goes into hiding. He encounters Aira, his co-worker who believes him to be innocent and allows him to stay at her place. Aira was on screen with Satoru before the time-skip, even admiring him after seeing him save a child from being hit by a truck, but it\u2019s here where her overall character is explored and, unfortunately, there\u2019s not much to go into. Airi and Satoru have a conversation about how she can trust him and she reveals how her parents divorced over the theft of a chocolate bar, this being one of the dumber explanations in the show overall. Regardless, from using that awful example she states how she has conflicting thoughts when it comes to believing in people and their motives. This could have been an interesting concept if explored into, but that never happens, and that seems to be a common nuance I have with the show overall. It has these interesting concepts and elements that could have the series more interesting and deep, but they all end up being undeveloped, underwhelming and a waste of potential.\\n\\n\r\nThe writing only gets worse from here. Satoru activates Revival through sheer willpower and reverts back to his child form soon after he is found and arrested by police, and with this second chance he intends to do everything he can to stop Kayo from being kidnapped. His actions go so far as to \u2018abduct\u2019 her himself and attempting to murder her mother. Both of these actions are pretty ridiculous, especially when you consider that it\u2019s a 29 year old man that\u2019s doing this, not a child. Eventually he returns her to her mother, who reacts violently towards Satoru and Sachiko, going so far as to try and kill Sachiko with a shovel. Now it is obvious that Kayo\u2019s mother is a loon that needs more than just counselling, but I find it annoying how she was previously shown to have gone through all the trouble of making sure her abuse wasn\u2019t noticeable, given that she was shown to have almost struck her daughter while in the company of other people. Through poor writing as the plot progressed, she proved to only be a one-dimensional villain; a mere caricature that ultimately holds no merits. Unfortunately, she\u2019s not the only one who turns out like this.\\n\\n\r\nIt is at this point where I see the story start to turn into shambles. Because of her mother\u2019s actions, Kayo moves away to live with her grandmother and away from Satoru, and with that subplot finished, Satoru begins on working to save the lives of the other two abductees. So far the show was loved by many at this point because of the progression of Satoru and Kayo\u2019s relationship and their individual development; Kayo learning to open up to others and Satoru never giving up on others. It was a cute friendship with hints of romance that swooned the anime community with its cute charm and visual guise. So when one half had left the show, it made many viewers feel like their investment had been somewhat wasted, myself included. However, there are more problems that stem from this change of focus, mainly in regards to the characters. The other two victims are Hiromi Sugita, one of his classmates, and Aya Nakanishi, a student from a neighbouring school and viewers learn next to nothing about either character. While Kayo was never the pinnacle of character development by any means, she mattered so much more to the overarching plot than Hiromi and Aya. It is so obvious that they are nothing more than replaceable characters to make Satoru look more heroic and likeable. Other supporting characters are also left lacklustre, with much of their rationale turning out to be, ironically, irrational. Kenya, one of Satoru\u2019s classmates, is perhaps the biggest example of this, seeming to be a character that was far more intelligent than he initially led on. But he just ended up getting shafted by poor writing, like most of the other characters in the show. The best character by far is Sachiko, and the reason why is because all of her actions are completely logical as well as the fact that beyond episode 1, she is never really explored, thus never even having the chance to get screwed up unlike everyone else. \\n\\n\r\nBut there is one character that stands out from the rest by just how awful he was utilized, and that is the real culprit; the man that abducted Kayo 18 years ago, and in present-time killed Sachiko. That man was revealed to be none other than Gaku Yashiro, Satoru\u2019s homeroom teacher. This revelation is made in episode 10 to Satoru minutes before his apparent death by being trapped in a frozen lake. This moment had any sense of shock or suspense completely absent because no one who watched this show was even surprised! The killer\u2019s identity is so obvious that it destroys any element of mystery \u2013 which it was initially marketed as \u2013 and does not help the show in any possible way. It only takes a couple episodes to figure out who the killer is with the blatant foreshadowing, and even if by some chance you don\u2019t realise it then, it\u2019s simple process of elimination. Just ask yourself \u201cWhich characters look like the killer?\u201d and there\u2019s probably only one person that comes up.  Another issue I have with the character is how he is presented as a mastermind for half the show, seemingly omnipresent and always throwing the blame to someone else. But towards the end, he turns into this incompetent idiot so drastically that it\u2019s laughable. Gaku being caught as the killer is also incredibly stupid to the point where you legitimately cannot take the series seriously anymore. It\u2019s as if his entire development jumped off a building ala Satoru in the last episode. Terrible\\n\\n\r\nMatter of fact, the entire ending is terrible and leaves a sour taste in the mouths of even the most die-hard fans. From the lead up with Satoru being in a coma for 15 years, to the final moment where Satoru and Airi meet again, it is all so contrived and full of plot holes that makes me wonder just what the original writer was thinking. Satoru becoming a successful manga artist afterwards because he \u2018found himself\u2019? I call bullshit! It left so many questions unanswered and decided to go for a \u201chappy ending\u201d than anything realistic, sacrificing what was left of any good writing and revealing its true colours as a show that at its core, was just emotionally manipulative. Its comparable to a slap in the face to those who wanted to know more about the world and the people in it, but perhaps the biggest problem I had most of all was how it completely ditched the concept of Revival.\\n\\n\r\nThe very first thing that intrigued me about this show was the Revival ability. While I did care about other features of the show later on, I was always thinking about the concept of it and how it could be explained. Time travel is in no way a new concept when it comes to anime, and the notion for it in this case seemed to just be a simple plot device to move the narrative along, but with time, effort and proper focus, could have developed into something more substantial. But as the show went on, the potential for this slowly dwindled down to false hope. At first, Revival only activates when an accident happens nearby, but on the fourth reset he was able to trigger it by yelling \u201cGo Back!\u201d with no accidents nearby him (of course, this had to happen the minute after the police had found him). And then they have the audacity to say Revival no longer activates once the real culprit is caught. What was even the point? The time resets were only used when it was convenient with all kinds of ways to trigger them, losing any sense of consistency by the end. \\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the visuals, Erased is consistently good with some breakout scenes here and there. The animation was done by A1 Pictures, a studio well known for their shows having a similar art style and while I can see many similarities to shows like Sword Art Online and GATE, Erased\u2019s style feels more refined and unique. This is probably due to how the show tries to go for a more cinematic look; the animation techniques used really helped to intensify the plot and overall atmosphere. It has the kind of visual look similar to that of Mamoru Hosoda films, a kind of spectacle uncommon among the medium. The way Erased was also able to present character emotions, specifically Satoru\u2019s internal conflict is certainly commendable; the kind of detail that is rarely seen in anime. However I do think the overall animation is somewhat overrated when it comes to symbolism. Both their handling and utilization of \u2018red is dead\u2019 and spider threads are rather poor, adding nothing to the actual narrative. When these literary devices are dumbed down so much, it should not be praised. Spoon feeding symbolism to viewers like they are all children is just lazy.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully, Erased does manage to excel when it comes to its music. The soundtrack was composed by Yuki Kajiura, known for her great work on the music from Sword Art Online and Fate/Zero, but here her work feels somewhat unimpressive. Many of the tracks complement the variety of scenes they are in, but overall are fairly typical and generic, with one OST in particularly \u2013 Only I Am Missing \u2013 sounding more like a classic Ghibli track than otherwise. The OP and ED however, were definite standouts, with Re:Re being an upbeat catchy opening that was never skipped and the ending fitting the mellow undertones quite well. Both were well crafted and made the experience more enjoyable. The English dub overall was well done, with extra compliments for having Satoru sound the least anime-like of all the characters; a rare yet wise decision from the director. Not only was this choice helpful in making the story feel more special, but also helped make Satoru a more likeable and relatable protagonist. The sound effects were the most admirable part of the entire show, as throughout all 12 episodes it has some of the most technically proficient use of basic sound that A1 Pictures has ever produced: from the footsteps in the snow to the whistling wind. These little things made the most impact in my opinion as it further immersed myself into the story and overall experience.\\n\\n\r\nAnd thus, these are my thoughts on Erased. It set the standard quite high in the beginning, but this turned out to do more harm than good in the long run. I would still recommend the show as it is an enjoyable watch and tells a heart-warming tale of a man trying to save those he lost in the past. But that in no way correlates to a good show. For every aspect about how visually stunning the show is, lies a handful of issues and problems in the writing. And when it slowly exposed these flaws it was as if the show was a snowball rolling down a hill, gradually picking up more plot holes and contrivances overall. But when it hits the ground, it breaks apart under its own weight, leaving hunks of snow in its place. Children still play with what is left, until it slowly vanishes and disappears from the ground. They\u2019re all sad the snow has left but only for a short time, as they all see right on the horizon another snowball starting to make its way down the hill. And just in time for the next season too.\\n",

Unfortunately, these same plot devices are only contrived for the sole purpose of making the audience have the so-called \u201cfeels.\u201d From a more logical perspective, they do not make any sense, and because of this, we are left with an inconsistent plotline that is riddled with flaws.\r\n(Side note: minor spoilers from this point on.)\r\nAs one example, consider how Kayo was abused by her mother. Although I am sure the author meant toincorporate some level of realism into his writing, Kayo\u2019s abuse was ultimately used as a way to draw the audience on an emotional basis. Since society frowns down upon all forms of child abuse, most people would accept it at face value and never question it. But let\u2019s be honest for a second: none of it was explained. Why was the abuse occurring? Were there any specific triggers? Why didn\u2019t anyone notice this if this has been happening for years? And so on.\\n\\n\r\nPlus, was it really necessary to use child abuse like this? There are so many other ways that you could have elicited just as powerful of an emotional response and NOT use something controversial. Being heartbroken, amending broken friendships, taking a stand with your friends, etc. (all of which could have been implemented in the context of this show, by the way) could have just as easily done the trick.\\n\\n\r\nNow aside from the emotional appeal, the rest of the plot doesn\u2019t make any sense either. For something that is so fundamental to the plot, there is no explanation as to how Satoru gained the Revival ability other than the fact that he somehow magically has it. In a world that is governed by the natural laws of this universe, the Revival ability hardly seems remotely realistic and, as a result, it seems to serve no real purpose other than to force the plot along. On top of all of that, the Satoru\u2019s Revival ability seemingly has no rules to it other than Satoru\u2019s free will. Need to use it because you really don\u2019t want to go to jail? No problem, Revival time! Don\u2019t need Revival ever again because you said so? Okay adios, now it\u2019s gone. Forever. Because of reasons.\\n\\n\r\nAs for pacing, it spans the entire spectrum: fast, slow, just right \u2013 it\u2019s all there. Sometimes the show pulls it off just dandy. The first episode, for example, was crazy fast, but it still eked out the main gist of what was going on: Satoru\u2019s weird mysterious power, the main characters, and so on. On the other hand, the last three episodes were fast too, but they were all crammed in a way that resulted in unsubstantial character development (e.g. Hiromi and Aya) even though it was clear from the first episode that the two of them played a significant role in the entire plot. Furthermore, all of this cramming eventually leads to important parts in the manga being left out \u2013 so, manga readers, beware!\\n\\n\r\nNow onto the characters. Sure, Satoru is collected and analytical, but his personality is incredibly dry. A lot of the other characters did not stand out that much either, minus maybe the smart, attentive Kenya. But what I found most remarkable about the characters was that some of them shared deep, meaningful relationships. For example: Satoru and his mom, Sachiko. A true motherly figure, Sachiko not only takes care of Satoru but also his friends. She knows how he thinks and operates on a day-to-day basis. She knows when not to pry into her son\u2019s life, and she respects him for who he is as a person. All of this is reflected in the short yet interesting dialogues between her and Satoru.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, some other relationships end up not being as strong as Satoru\u2019s and Sachiko\u2019s. Satoru and Kayo is one example of this. The middle 6 or 7 episodes were intentionally slowed down in terms of pacing so that the two of them could build their relationship from out of thin air to something deep. And for the most part, the show accomplishes this well. But in the last three episodes of the show, the show takes a complete U-turn, tossing out their entire relationship out the window. Now before you accuse me for being super butthurt or laughing at me because their \u201cship\u201d sank, let me be clear: I would have no problem with this if this were executed well, but let\u2019s break down what happens. To start off, Satoru\u2019s been there for Kayo from the very beginning, so it really does not make sense how she would turn her back on him after Satoru reawakens. Sure, maybe the other-guy-in-the-picture had gotten to know Kayo when Satoru wasn\u2019t physically around, but there was nothing in the anime that suggested such a thing. Just a minute of explanation and leaving things at the status quo wouldn\u2019t be an issue. Satoru and Airi is another example, since the anime leaves out a huge chunk of their relationship in its adaptation.\\n\\n\r\nMoving away from the characters and now onto the sound and the art. The artwork is animated by A-1 Pictures. They\u2019ve also animated Shigatsu, AnoHana, SAO, and the whole spiel so it is done well. Sound is also great. The music was timed well to create an ominous mood when it was needed. Voice acting was decent too, although none of it was that exceptional.\\n\\n\r\nIn the grand scheme of things, ERASED is a watchable show and I wouldn\u2019t mind recommending this to others. Emotional appeal isn\u2019t inherently bad. Think about Clannad After Story, Little Busters! Refrain, and others \u2013 they all had their charm, and ERASED is just another show that falls into that category. However, basing an entire plot primarily on emotional appeal \u2013 that\u2019s when things start to fall apart and become incomprehensible and illogical. That\u2019s why ERASED isn\u2019t a masterpiece \u2013 but it\u2019s not downright horrible either. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: C+\\n\\n\r\nAuthor's Disclaimer: Please remember, this is my own personal opinion. I critique anime primarily on how the story is executed and how well-rounded the characters are. This review is not meant to target any other review but was intended to provide a more holistic analysis.\\n\\n\r\nIt should also be noted that this is a full-fledged review of the entire season.\\n",

            "content": "Ambition is the elixir of creation. It is that which gives spirit to its container, and those rare gems that rise above their standardized, rehashed counterparts are almost always backed by the unadulterated ambition of their creator(s). And ambition rests on the shoulders of ideas. The notion of ideas and ambition being interlocked is an unspoken truth - a virtuous tenet of great works. However, there is something more; something that too often gets overlooked, and when untended, sets both ambition and the idea that bore it on route for inevitable disaster. That \u2018something\u2019 is focus. An idea \u2013 no matter how great or innovativeit is \u2013 even if backed by a cosmic-scaled ambition will remain infantile if it has no tangible focus to drive it. The focus conundrum is one that plagues creators alike no matter how big their starry ideas are or juiced up their spirit is, the end-result will remain a disappointment and one that\u2019s far greater than those that are destined for mediocrity or lower from the get-go. \\n\\n\r\nThis focus- malady was essentially what broke one of the most promised shows of the 2015 winter season. Boku dake ga Inai Machi or Erased, even with its high points and a decent number of redeeming factors could not be fully salvaged as a whole, for its ambitions were high and ideas notable, but it lacked a solid backbone to support it - leaving it to bear its half-hearted promises openly for all.\\n\\n\r\nAdapted from the manga by Sanbe Kei, Erased revolves around a 29-year old Satoru Fujinuma \u2013 an unsuccessful mangaka \u2013 who has a supernatural ability that allows him to revert time to prevent ill-fated disasters. The plot of Erased however is triggered by the murder of someone close to Satoru for which he becomes the suspect for. In order to resolve this mystery, his \u201cability\u201d sends him back to when he was a grade-school student where he discovers that the murders of his present could be connected to crimes that occurred in his past, specifically the abduction and murder of his classmate Hinazuki Kayo. This revelation sets off the causal pendulum of Erased. \\n\\n\r\nOne thing that should be immediately obvious is that the premise isn\u2019t groundbreaking. The reason why this is important is because it seems like many \u201ccriticisms\u201d floating around are obsessed with the notion of ridiculing this show but couldn\u2019t find a reason beyond \u201cwow this is really unoriginal\u201d. Unoriginality has become one of the most use-when-convenient forms of criticism that it becomes almost a detractor for anyone using it as such, since it signifies nothing. There is no working definition of originality anymore and the free-for-all, nebulous meaning which people assign nowadays bears absolutely no value to the reader nor does it add any particular insight. Saying something is unoriginal is not a stand-alone in-of-it-self argument, just like arguing something is good because it is/was well-executed. Just because \u201ctime-travel\u201d has been employed by numerous works in the past does not mean every work to adopt it in the present of future will or should be instantly written off because of complaints of imitation. What matters is how the individual work molds its premise, constructs it within the bounds of its narrative, and resolves them. It\u2019s the technicalities, the nuances, the hows and whys, the internal mechanics that fuel the progression that will validate the premise, not sketchy, ambiguous buzz terminology. \\n\\n\r\nIn the case of Erased, its premise is nothing glamorous, but the way the plot points were built: through visual direction, atmospheric intensity, and having a tight grasp on consequential progression made it worth investing in \u2013 at least initially. This was crucial to the essence of the series considering that its foundational appeal was that of a psychological thriller/mystery. Regardless of the tonal transformation and genre shifts that occur later where the series opts to rely more on drama tactics, incorporating slice of life elements, and some traces of romance, its base appeal came from the mystery and the psychological turmoil it exposed of its characters and their circumstances. The mystery element was always supposed to be at the forefront and there was nothing subtle about that. For the first three episodes, Erased keeps a strong-hold on its world \u2013 revealing necessary information and characters, whispering secrets to the audiences, invoking an uncomfortable environment, and keeping the momentum high with each episode\u2019s conclusion. Not only did it manage to stimulate audience imagination but it continuously teased one\u2019s curiosity (even if the mystery itself wasn\u2019t that complicated or hard to figure out). That in itself is rather commendable since it implies that in such a short time/frame the work was able to create an atmosphere that transcended its intended appeal. This is probably the core reason why the show was able beguile its viewer so imminently and intensely.  \\n\\n\r\nYet, the atmospheric grandness that tempted the curiosity of its viewers wasn\u2019t enough. It did well enough to create that illusion and avoid giving \u201cgood\u201d answers for a while, but eventually the mask it adorned started to crack, and the hollowness of what was inside began to permeate the stage.  At some crossroad, the once-focused direction of the series morphed into a jarring vision-less drama. The fundamental problem with Erased wasn\u2019t bad characters or thematic inconsistency but something far more basic than that. It lacked focus, completely. What began as a finely focused show morphed into a hodge-podge of splattered ideas that went everywhere except where they needed to. Inconsistencies began to appear, plot devices began to appear, character absurdity began to appear, and things that didn\u2019t matter began to matter, because that\u2019s the result of a complete loss of focus. This amplified almost every flaw of the show, which might have not been a flaw prior, but with the sudden loss of vision, they became a very tangible reality.\\n\\n\r\nThis lack of focus led to the ultimate downfall of the series. Due to the show not knowing what it was doing, the audience didn\u2019t know how to digest what\u2019s being presented and this led to many misguided problems. For example, being unfocused caused many of the character problems that appeared, especially regarding the nature of Satoru\u2019s relationship with Kayo. Another flaw that surfaced was the pacing. The constant regurgitation of emphasizing about how much Satoru cares (by resetting over and over) turned a potential point of good character exploration into a feels-y gimmick. This fared to be quite devastating, since the show had very little time to spend on other characters, motivations, and the resolution which ultimately made some of those aspects feel incomplete and lackluster. Even some of the visual strengths became glaringly flawed. The heavy-handed use of color, shadowing, transitioning that all literally added to the narrative now appeared to be chicanery, because the focus that once drove those things existed no more.\\n\\n\r\nThough it must be noted, Erased has a lot of problems but many of the flaws that have been repeatedly argued are so over-exaggerated and a product of nit-picking that I feel almost compelled to address them, and by extension, offer some defense. For one example, the claim that the series has bad characters because some of them are one-dimensional is absurd. There is something called foil characters, or static characters that exist for the sole purpose to add dimension and value to primary characters (and their overall development). This is specifically in regards to Kayo\u2019s mother and other characters that had very specific functions. A work having a cast involving some static characters does not equate to bad characters altogether. Though, this does not negate the actual instances of weak character exploration and contrivances in the show which was definitely a problem, but that alone does not stand as a valid critique of overall bad characterization.  \\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, the claim that Erased was thematically impotent because it didn\u2019t do anything grand with its depiction of \u201cchild abuse\u201d is really just baffling. Why should it? The show paraded as many different things, but one thing it never claimed was the title of some deep and meaningful commentary nor was child abuse a theme of the show, rather it was more a catalyst. It\u2019s completely acceptable for a work to create a backstory of a character in any way it desires as long as it adds to the narrative, and the abuse was crucial to the first timeline. It wasn\u2019t added to make some grand sentiment about the subject itself. It actually made way for character exploration and interaction, and some of the themes of hope, change, camaraderie that the show tries to instill. Of course, whether those themes were meaningful in the larger context of things is questionable.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, the  flak it received for the supernatural aspect is also bizarre. The ability that Satoru had was something that had to be assumed on the part of the viewer and the world of Erased. Of course it can be argued that it\u2019s a convenient plot device, but it seems to be a pointless endeavor. To illustrate, when watching horror films, does the need to question the existence of ghosts or demons ever deter from the film\u2019s actual value? It is an assumed trait of the plot, the world, and the premise of the work and there is nothing inherently wrong with adopting a supernatural plot point, given that the world supports it. In Satoru\u2019s case, it was briefly explained within the context of the story\u2019s ambition. It isn\u2019t utilized from a sci-fi perspective where there needs to pages of subtext and exposition explaining why and how the mechanics of this ability work for the story to have meaning or merit. The problem arises when the ability or element is used as a cop-out or for petty outs over proper conclusions, but that lies on the plot holes caused by the ability, not the ability itself or the lack of explanation surrounding it. In scope of that, there could have been more substance behind it, which might have helped the show\u2019s fundamental problem of focus, but it isn\u2019t a point that drives this show into the gutter that many have placed it in solely due to this ability existing without a manual explaining it. \\n\\n\r\nRegardless of its post-hubris problems and its anticlimactic descent, there were some components of Erased that remained impeccable and worth experiencing. The visual and sound aspects of the show were really a treat. For the most part, they created the exact kind of feeling necessary for impact. The mood that Erased was able to consistently supply and maintain was nothing short of a feat. It kept its melancholic roots steadily into the ground and its eerie nature steadily at the forefront, even if some of it was in vain; it was still emotive and compelling. \\n\\n\r\n It was absolutely successful in its ability to deliver what all good thrillers should: tension. I cannot stress how amazingly this series constructed build-ups and as consequence, a chilling tension that seeped through the screen.This was perfectly captured throughout the show. And even though the mystery itself seemed pretty simplistic, the tension and atmosphere created by the series never allowed the viewer to turn back. It stuck to basic ingredients and partly delivered on that with great fervor. Additionally, even if the overarching focus was lost, some of the moments in the show were extremely well-done and dramatized in a way that were quite evocative. These interactions helped weave the thematic fabric of the show while also refining the characters in the process, in a fairly meaningful way. This was pure magic created by how well the atmosphere was able to drive the dynamics of the series from its plot choices to its character imperatives.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Erased was a solidly entertaining show that had a good deal to offer, and I enjoyed the ride - as haphazard and bumpy it was. Though I still can't help feel - even with its redeeming points -the biting disappointment that continues to linger through over lost potential and misdirection. Even with its spirited ambition, and interesting ideas, the lack of focus kept it from becoming a work of stature, and left it ingrained as nothing more than bittersweet memory that unfortunately cannot be reverted.\\n",

            "content": "It was a cold, uncompromising winter in the early weeks of 2016 but thankfully a new anime had heralded its arrival with a promise warm the world\u2019s hearts. People braved the blizzard of mediocrity to find that one show that could rise to the top and be the ray of sunshine they craved. Boku dake ga Inai Machi (Or known by its English title \u2018Erased\u2019) waved its hand high and proud, promising a touching tale of one man\u2019s journey to fix both the past and the present. The show did indeed have a certain glow about it that appealed to me but it\u2019s sad tosay that it died out into a whimper by the time the curtains had closed.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s unsurprising to see the initial widespread interest Erased generated because it had a list of ingredients that when put together could create something special. Time travel? Murder? Mystery? I strapped myself in for what I expected to be a tense experience that would leave me searching for answers. But as anyone would know, you could have a list of the finest ingredients available and in the hands of an incompetent chef it would turn into a disaster. Erased delivers what is an underwhelming execution to a setting that promised more. I was left bitterly disappointed by the show\u2019s conveniences placed into the script and its underwhelming reveals. Despite some memorable scenes, Erased has left little impact on me.\\n\\n\r\nWe follow Satoru Fujinuma (Voiced by anime debutants Shinnosuke Mitsushima and Tao Tsuchiya), a 29-year-old manga artist with an ability to go back in time several minutes before some form of tragedy strikes. His ability, which he titles \u2018revival\u2019, gives him a chance to change events to prevent any disaster from happening. When one of the most horrifying incidents imaginable befalls him, his ability kicks in. This time however it\u2019s not just minutes but years that Satoru gets sent back. Working with his old school classmates he tries his best to catch a criminal and change the future \u2013 or the present he just arrived from depending how you look at it. Realising the significance of the time period he\u2019s found himself in, Satoru starts to dig around for the solution to not just change one but several lives for the better.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening episode of Erased was one that left me asking questions \u2013 but in a good way. It had easily done enough to get me make me care about what the end result could be. It screamed one thing above all: Potential. There was one big problem that began to develop however and that was the anime betrayed my expectations that it had helped me to establish early on in the piece. Following its presentation of suspects and the crimes in 1988 that took place I was led to believe that we would be dealing with a mystery. Everything in the first couple of episodes pointed the show towards going in that direction, from being shown the wrongfully accused to Satoru playing the detective with his childhood friends. As the episodes progressed, however, I came to realise that there was no chance the show would be taking that route. The perpetrator becomes bleeding obvious far too early on, so all that was left was to see Satoru\u2019s progress in getting closer to them. I couldn\u2019t help but feel that the writers of Erased were treating me, the viewer, like an idiot. Any \u2018clues\u2019 they start to throw your way are as subtle as taking a tyre iron to the head. This strange misdirection Erased put me through took me some time to assess and get over.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I was left with when the show reached its final few episodes was some strange mess caught halfway between a mystery and a thriller, just floundering about and being below average at both genres. For a while there was enough in both respects to keep Erased entertaining. It seemed the less I knew about the overall picture that the more the show had me by the hook. But as it peels away the layers of the story guarding the identity of the culprit it tore away my emotional investment. There aren\u2019t enough interwoven clues in the story to be deemed a rewarding mystery yet there is nowhere near enough tension to labelled a competent thriller. Is there at least some interesting character dynamics to cling on to? Not really. Because the characters at the centre of the conflict aren\u2019t compelling \u2013 particularly the culprit \u2013 I didn\u2019t find myself on the edge of my seat when I was clearly being prompted to. Erased is, essentially, a show with no identity.\\n\\n\r\nErased ultimately abandons its \u2018mystery\u2019 and spends far too long building up the relationship between Satoru and classmate Kayo Hinazuki in its place. In a rough defence of this, Kayo\u2019s story at least does enough to keep the show watchable. Watching her outlook on the world shift thanks to the events of the show is somewhat satisfying. Aoi Yuuki (Madoka Kaname of Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica) is a good choice as Kayo\u2019s voice actress, carrying across a certain bitterness and melancholy to the role of the downtrodden class member. Her arc at least did enough to get me invested in her character but the cast as a whole just didn\u2019t reel me in. Kayo\u2019s angle could only carry the overall story for so long, and it\u2019s clear to see the pacing then kicks up into overdrive to compensate for the lost time. As much as I didn\u2019t mind her screen time, Erased spends too much time making us care for Kayo when Satoru could have used a similar amount of attention. The character interactions suffer because Satoru\u2019s at the centre of most of them. A negative mention must also go towards Kayo\u2019s mother who was a laughably over-malicious character written that way just to stir the pot, looking at baiting an emotional response from the viewer with her abusive antics. The reasons for her behaviour are never explored and thus cheapens the attempt at generating empathy for Kayo.\\n\\n\r\nThe writing behind Satoru\u2019s character is bizarre. For a 29-year-old he seems to lose a ton of emotional maturity upon being sent back to his 10-year-old body. On top of that, for someone attempting to play the detective, logic seems devoid from Satoru. He makes some unbelievable decisions throughout the course of the show that might have been excusable for a 10 or 11-year-old to make but not someone with two decades more life experience. It\u2019s almost like the writers forgot to separate his mind from body when writing the scenes set in 1988. There actually isn\u2019t much that\u2019s memorable about Satoru\u2019s character as a whole, whether it be his older or younger self. He\u2019s a standard, cold main character that does nothing to leave an impression. We\u2019re supposed to be following his story but it feels like we\u2019re riding along the coattails of others.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s disappointing to see that the show\u2019s writing doesn\u2019t match up to its presentation. There\u2019s a few good visuals utilised to help set the tone. There are some scenes that can even be called drop-dead gorgeous. It\u2019s ultimately a wasted effort because a good script and interesting characters aren\u2019t there to make use of it. The motivations of the perpetrator are glossed over to the point where I even questioned why on earth I even bothered to use my brain to try and search for the answer myself. The reasoning was so unsatisfying it actually made me angry, considering it was what set the entire series into action. I\u2019m not a manga reader of the series but, from what I have discerned, the writers left a massive chunk of information out of this area. The best villains in fiction are flawed for reasons we can understand, when we are given reasons for their actions that we can dwell upon. If you come into Erased expecting something of that sort, then prepare to be left sorely disappointed. \\n\\n\r\nAfter a first episode that got me hooked Erased began to stall, then ultimately collapse under the weight of all that it was trying to take on in the space of 12 episodes. No amount of decent visuals from A-1 Pictures could fix their clunky handling of the story, mostly forgettable cast and simply shambolic writing choices. Conveniences that lay around every corner go a long way to distracting me from any tension director Tomohiko Itou (Sword Art Online, Gin no Saji) was attempting to layer into the story. There always feels like a way out no matter how cornered or dangerous a situation seems to be. Satoru\u2019s revival ability isn\u2019t explored or explained in great detail, making itself useful at the most convenient of times. Many parts of the story feel irrelevant considering the conclusion the show arrives at. Erased seems like an appropriate title for a show that won't be hanging around in my memory for long.\\n",

            "content": "Spoilers ahead!\r\nOverall: 4/10\r\nERASED is the single most overrated anime I have ever come across. The fact that this is a 9.08/10 on MAL at the time of writing is unbelievable. Please completely disregard the reviewing credibility of those proclaiming this anime as a masterpiece and a 10/10 because it most definitely not.  \r\nStory: 3/10\r\nThis is the worst part about the show. The story was an absolute trainwreck that fails to be intriguing or interesting at any point. The mystery element of the show is absolutely dreadful as it was clear who was the killer from the start. This meant the suspense of the storywas completely meaningless due to the fact that Yashiro was the only person that the show indicated the killer to be. It was the most obvious reveal for a poor excuse for a villain I have EVER seen. The last few episodes were also very anti climatic and rushed, with a last episode being the worst example of these problems. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10\\n\r\nNow, the characters of ERASED aren't all that bad; but they're nothing special, either. I thought Satoru, Hinazuki and Satoru's mum were all decent characters, but I don't feel the same about any of the others. All of Satoru's friends were relatively uninteresting with no defining qualities and they remained quite one-dimensional throughout the story, blindly following Satoru in his quest to save children from loneliness with no real motives of their own. \\n\r\nFollowing this, Hinzauki's mother was the poorest character of them all, with her abuse of her daughter being justified through \"oh she was a victim too\". She also shows no motives for her abuse of Hinazuki but simply beats her as a plot device. \\n\r\nYashiro is a close second to the worst character of the anime. The show spouted some mumbo jumbo shit expecting the viewers to buy the poor justification it gives to Yashiro's killing.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nI liked the OP and ED of the series and this was probably the aspect of the show I liked the most. The OP was riddled with imagery and meaningful aspects. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\r\nThe art of the show was pretty average to be honest. I liked the style and some scenes had excellent use of colour but there were a few CGI shots that I felt to be out of place that detached me from the experience. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10\\n\r\nI looked forward to every episode of the show during the first 3 episodes but after that I started to easily notice the problems that the anime had and the lack of suspense in this \"mystery\" anime.",

That actually seemed a bit weird, why is that even there?\\n\\n\r\n-Characters\\n\r\nFinally something I even have a few positive things to say about.\\n\r\nSatoru's mom is made to be a very compassionate person, maybe even overly so, but i can't complain because there's a real lack of decent parents in anime.\\n\r\nMost of the characters don't have that much personality behind them, but at least they're not cardboard cut outs.\\n\r\nSatoru himself is a very cynical MC, those have been very popular lately, he develops pretty much like you would expect.\\n\r\nSo at least halfway decent main cast, but as I said before Some characters are just obviously evil and have no redeeming qualities.\\n\r\nThe killer is also a completely uninteresting character.\\n\r\nSatoru's friends at least got a personality quirk or two.\\n\r\nAnd the pizza girl whoever she was felt like a pretty pointless character.\\n\\n\r\n-Summary\\n\r\nThe best thing I could compare this anime to is Mirai nikki, That one is also completely filled with plot holes and has a cool premise that doesn't really work out.\\n\r\nIt's not a good watch if you want a mystery, it's not good as a thriller and it only kinda works as a drama.\\n\r\nAt the very least it's presented nicely so it's easy to consume.\\n\r\nUnless you absolutely need to watch a Time travel Drama and can't just watch Steins;Gate again there's nothing here for you.\\n\r\nIt's not like this is the worst thing ever but it was still a big waste of potential.\\n\r\nPS. can we all just collectively agree to never hype shit up again?",

            "content": "Overview:\r\nI'm late to this party, but I'm kind of glad I took my time to review this series. This anime got absurdly overrated and overhyped back when it came out for reasons I never understood. It's been 3 long years since then...and this is still one of the most overrated anime on MAL. The series has little moments where it has potential. It's not THAT bad on a technical level. I gave it a VERY generous 5 because I really don't believe in rating bombing. Otherwise, I would create 10 clone accounts and keep giving it a 1. I just sit back and laugh thatthis garbage is sitting at an 8.5+ rating 3 years later. Even the most \"filthy casual\" anime can laugh at Erased. This is a series that doesn't deserve to shine Gundam Wing's shoes or stand in the presence of Inuyasha. Elfen Lied wipes its ass with Erased. Then again, I can't spend this entire review talking about its MAL rating, so let's get on with it!\\n\\n\r\nPlot and characters:\\n\\n\r\nThe main character is a 29 year old manga artist named Satoru Fujinuma. He has a mysterious super power called \"The Revival\" that allows him to travel back in time a few minutes and alter history. He uses this a few minutes into the first episode to prevent a fatal traffic accident. Throughout the series, Satoru's powers never seem to follow any consistent rules. We don't understand how he gained The Revival. We don't understand the mechanism by which it works. We don't know shit about The Revival...other than IT GOES HARD (HARD) ALL DAY ALL NIGHT! (cough) I deeply apologize for that joke. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, Satoru's mother suddenly figures out who the real killer was that murdered several of Satoru's classmates back in elementary school. For some reason, the real killer instantly realizes that she figured it out and kills Mrs. Fujinuma. Satoru walks in to see that his mother has been stabbed to death and then the police instantly burst in and think he did it for some reason. Fortunately, The Revival triggers and Satoru is sent back in time 18 years. Now Satoru must find out who the killer is and prevent the murders from taking place. The next few episodes are actually pretty decent. Satoru helps a childhood friend who is dealing with domestic abuse and the anime tackles this topic with surprising grace. The good times don't last though, because this is only 12 episodes and we find out very quickly who the killer is. Hint, it's the guy that looks blatantly evil. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSatoru is able to prevent several murders and here is where the series really goes downhill. The killer gains this absolute obsession with Satoru and the thrill of having a rival. The anime tries REALLY hard to force this Batman/Joker dynamic, but it doesn't have enough time to feel remotely natural. The killer figures out the Satoru is the one thrwarting his plans and leaves Satoru locked in a car that he drives into the middle of a lake. We flash forward 18 years and Satoshi wakes out of a coma. How the hell was he rescued from the bottom of the lake? The anime never tells us. Fuck you! That's how! It is revealed that the killer has been anxiously waiting this entire time for Satoru to wake up and hasn't killed anyone in that whole time because it would be no fun without his rival to try and stop him. Satoru completes him and life is meaningless without his rivalry with Satoru. Are you fucking kidding me?! Satoru stopped a couple murders and temporarily set back his child killing scheme for a few months. This dynamic worked in The Killing Joke, because Batman and Joker had 50 fucking years of history together! Satoru nabs the bad guy in an incredibly contrived set up and everything ends happily. Well...besides Satoru spending his entire young adult life in a coma in this timeline. The End.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound:\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation by A-1 Pictures was fine here. A lot of people love to shit on A-1 because they made SAO, but it really wasn't that bad. Oh and BTW, Erased happens to share a director with SAO. Just an interesting bit of trivia. The soundtrack was handled by the talented Yuki Kajiura, who has done far better work on series like Baccano. However, I have no complaints about the music. It's fine.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nErased is a very condensed manga adaptation that had about 12 unforgivable flaws for every one thing it did right. Most of us have series that we love despite being heavily flawed. Hellsing Ultimate, Parasyte, and Fate/Zero are all series I love despite them having laughably stupid plots. I love Berserk 97 despite the fact it's barely animated. I love this one anime that had budget problems so severe that it ended with a 2 episode philosophy powerpoint. My frustration with Erased is not just that it had a few flaws, it's that watching Erased is an infurating experience. You board the plane and it has technical issues and sits on the runway for 2 hours. Then it finally gets into the air and you're sitting there like \" Ok, this is fine\". Then one of the engines explode and the plane nosedives right into the New York City dump. That's essentially what it's like to watch Erased. This is one case where you REALLY can't trust the MAL rating. I'd highly recommend skipping this one.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Losing a beloved person would certainly leave any person stricken with grief and confusion: self-condemnation and thoughts of preventing such death are things that would cross anyones mind. Luckily in the case Boku Dake Inai Machi, or Erased in its english title, the protagonist Satoru Fujinuma finds himself able to travel back in time to prevent such tragedy from happening; furthermore, he is set back at the time where a fellow classmate died. This is not everything: the mystery surrounding the death of the girl also seems to be tied to that of his very own family. Erased is a psychological mystery anime that portrayshuman drama, yet sadly was very disappointing, being the characters and numerous plot holes the main culprits. However, it must be mentioned that it has a great direction in animation and a good buildup in the first few episodes, which arguably was enthralling, pulling viewers into the show.\\n\\n\r\n~Story~\\n\\n\r\nThe main problem in Erased lies in the little problems that become apparent as the show progresses: these ultimately are magnified by many others, which will be depicted. The concept of preventing occurrences through time travelling has been explored in numerous other works, yet a problem with the anime is the fact that these are completely random, allowing the author to make any necessary changes in direction when necessary. This is not bad on its own, yet instead of using it as means to develop the characters in the story, it utilizes it purely to change the direction in the narrative, which was not done in a subtle manner. Regardless of said issue, it managed to create some tension in the story as viewers never really could correctly anticipate the course of the narrative.\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned earlier, the protagonist is able to travel back in time to his 11-year-old self to prevent a certain death from happening, in a time in which one of his classmates died. However, it becomes soon apparent that the protagonist does not explore said option at all, and instead of going to the root of the problem, investigating the possible murder, he decides to protect Hinazuki, his classmate. Another complication is also associated with the mystery surrounding the murderer: it is very clear who it is, which is not a great issue on its own, but the anime does not offer any alternative that may leave viewers in doubt. In essence, this anime fails at being a good \"mystery\". The anime also presents human drama, yet was rather poorly portrayed because of the characters actions and all the events tied to those. These were often of very simple nature, such as parents beating their own child, deaths or betrayal just to name some. The main problem with these are that they're cheap, without ever sufficiently expanding on it in a satisfying manner. It must be said that it uses this to its advantage to create tension, but it is just that,  tension and shock factor without any strong meaning behind it. In addition, the anime sets up a lot of things, time-travelling, possible consequences of his own actions, yet just never explores them in-depth.\\n\\n\r\nThe problems are further magnified by the pacing of the work, which is rather lackluster as well. The introductionary episodes are satisfying, yet as the show progresses, it quickly becomes apparent that important segments that contribute to the overall plot are either too rushed or information is omitted, whereas the more \"mundane\" moments are too much focused upon. In fact, the majority of the show is centered around Hinazuki and her problems - but to this later. This actually brings into play the positive aspect of the anime, the interludes between the different occurrences, which are generally well executed portraying insight into the characters and their emotional state: however, this doesn't affect the important points of the story. There are just so many improbable events in the story that it just looses any credibility it has, going from nonsensical behaviour of the characters, or just the sheer amount of centering on the violence exerted by a second party - victimizing for the sake of it is not good writing.\\n\\n\r\n~Characters~\\n\\n\r\nThe major issue that brought the whole series down were its cast of characters: they didn't act according to their age, their motives/goals were either very lackluster or were just a mess, and ultimately the abrupt changes in behaviour to accommodate the direction in story. There is the 29-year-old Satoru, a typical otaku protagonist being mostly indifferent to society, and has the power to prevent deaths by sneakpeaking into the future. The main problem with this character is his incomprehensible and irrational behaviour he displays throughout the series, such as fleeing from a crime scene he didn't commit or even attempt on murder. In addition, his main goal of seeking the killer just shifts from finding the murderer to protecting his classmate - which in turn brings up the pedophilic tendencies the protagonist displays towards the minor. The anime develops a light romance, which includes Satoru constantly thinking of either being together with said person, or even imagining things when in the bathroom. This came out of nowhere, and just felt very off-putting for obvious reasons. Character development is present, yet is lackluster and limited by the actions of the character himself; rather than resolving the issues on his own, it gets resolved by a second party, which is understandable due to his physical appearance, yet could have been expanded on.\\n\\n\r\nThen there is Hinazuki, a victim of child abuse, which throughout almost the whole series is treated as a mere plot device, rather than human being - it could be compared to seeing a soulless robot. Luckily enough, she gets fleshed out in which through subtle scenes her human side is displayed. Which is a nice change to the constant unnecessary abuse scenes. Other character of interest is the super intelligent psychoanalyst Kenya, who possesses an intellect far superior to that of Satoru despite being only 11 years old. He aids the main character in many instances, yet his motives behind why he supports the protagonist are rather lacking as well, as he apparently was smart enough to solve various issues. Finally, the last character of interest is the murderer: although he is portrayed to be a mastermind behind the scenes, avoiding detection over the span of several decades, he makes tremendous mistakes when the main character is concerned. He ultimately degrades to a simple one-dimensional villain with no convincing motive at all: furthermore, this also raises the question why said person took so many poor decisions and why he just didn't switch his killing target(s) when things became too heated and unfavourable.\\n\\n\r\nThe various interactions between the cast are handled poorly in most cases, be it the one dimensional evil parent or perverted manager, or the supporting cast whose poor choices leads viewers questioning their mental age; or just the fact that most act as passive observers.  Because of the stale personalities of the cast and their changes in behaviour, the interactions between them feel unnatural: however, this mainly affects the main plot points. For the slice of life moments, these were often well handled by the studio - those were often the most enjoyable parts of the anime, which is a huge disappointment, as it is not the main purpose of the show.\\n\\n\r\n~Animation and sound~\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that can be given credit to the studio is its direction and use of animation: this was well done, displaying the various themes the anime had to offer such as loneliness, isolation, happiness, you name it. Through the art it is able to portray the different emotional states as well as physical conditions of the characters; despite executing this well, it is rendered useless when the narrative constantly shows constant abuse, making these little detail utterly pointless, which is a waste of resources. An example would be the focussing upon the bruises of Hinazuki. As for the art style itself, I personally didn't like it and found it off in some situations, be it in the character design or the different facial expressions. The anime also tried to mitigate the problem regarding the mystery behind the killer by applying red eyes to suspects, yet this is a cheap alternative to creating tension, and when everyone is can have those eyes, it loses its purpose.\\n\\n\r\nConcerning the soundtrack of Erased, it often uses the different compositions to its advantage to correctly portray the various atmospheres of the show, intertwining with the dialogue: piano, violins, xylophones, gloomy tones, you name it. There is fact a huge preference to classical instruments, which was a good choice. The opening and endings were equally well crafted, presenting the themes the anime had to offer with some pop tunes to it. As for the voice actors, these generally performed their tasks well, complying with the different personalities of the cast. This wasn't entirely the case with the protagonists, where no significant difference could be appreciated from his various emotional states.\\n\\n\r\n~Enjoyment~\\n\\n\r\nErased had some potential, yet failed in executing the basic elements of the show, which was due to the little issues that ultimately snowballed into bigger ones - which is a shame, as its direction and usage of animation was befitting and well executed.  I quite honestly did not enjoy the series at all, despite being intrigued by the first batch of episodes: the characters, lack of expansion upon key elements as the villain or time travelling gimmick are just a few of the many issues that made it a bad anime. It fails in providing a good mystery with cheap cliffhangers and shock factor to accomplish tension. It praises itself on being a human drama, but it equally lacks in said theme. Now I will admit I never have been a fan of drama, which made it more difficult to enjoy that genre. I personally do not recommend this anime, unless you aren't bothered by the above mentioned problems - which in turn, can make for an intriguing ride. Boku Dake Inai Machi is ultimately a show that feeds itself on cheap emotions and thrills.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading.\\n",

With it's sky rocketing popularity and rank on myanimelist in such a small amount of time, Erased has successfully caught the attention of the crowd and everyone has probably watched it or thought of watching it soon. Here on myanimelist, most of the reviewers are filled with negativity and are over-exaggerating the negative points of this anime. It is not that bad as most of the reviews are indicating here. So here I'm writing a honestand positive review of Erased.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\r\nErased narrates the story of Satoru Fujinuma, who is a 29 years old and works as a pizza delivery boy. He posses a strange ability called 'Revival'. This ability, 'Revival' sends him 2 to 5 minutes back in time, without his consent, whenever something dangerous happens around him. He usually tries to figure out what is wrong in his surroundings and tries to prevent that dangerous thing from happening. When he was wrongfully accused of murdering his mom, in the first episode itself, he is sent 18 years back in time when he was 11 years old in 6th grade where he tries to solve one mystery of serial abduction and murder going around the school to prevent his mother's murder in the future as they seemed related.\\n\r\nI feel that the initial story (from first to fourth episode) is the reason why Erased became so popular and highly rated! It's thrilling! The suspense will really eat you and will left you wanting for more. You will probably want to binge-watch the show or jump onto reading the manga to know more.\\n\r\nBut after the first half of the show, I feel that the story starts moving in a wrong direction and it sort of becomes less thrilling. The studio was clearly rushing a bit to complete the anime in 12 episodes only.\\n\r\nThere are many things which are left unexplained. For example, Satoru's ability of 'Revival'. So yeah that's the reason why I have rated the 'Story' section 8 instead of 10.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nErased clearly flaunts it's art in many ways. The backgrounds and scenes, like the Christmas Tree scene which was made using the stars in the sky, successfully delivers warm and entertaining moments. The way 'Revival' is portrayed by showing a blue butterfly across the screen and the way history or the future is compared with the timeline using movie reels makes Erased more interesting to watch. The suspenseful atmosphere which Erased is able to create, and the facial expressions which arouses suspicions on various characters are perfectly executed which supports it's mystery genre incredibly well.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nBeing a fan of Asian Kung-Fu Generation, I loved the opening of Erased, \"Re:Re:\" right off the bat. The ED \"Sore wa Chiisana Hikari no Youna\" by Sayuri is a beautiful song indeed. The OSTs are carefully played at crucial moments and is able to set the suspenseful mood very nicely.\\n\r\nComing to the voice actors, they have done an incredible acting. The way Satoru uses his adult voice to show his real mature self is interesting.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nThere are some characters whom I really liked. And there are a few for whom I don't give a damn.\\n\r\nSatoru Fujinuma, as an adult, is a very boring character. But he has a really good side which forces him to save people whenever 'Revival' is triggered, and sometimes he even hurts himself in that process. On the other hand, Satoru, as a kid, seems more interesting. His boring side is removed and he's got determination, sense of humor and a really cool and gutsy side which makes him a likable character.\\n\r\nKayo Hinazuki, the girl whom Satoru is determined to save from being the victim on the serial murders, gets a good amount of screen time and development. The circumstances which she is going through like being abused by her mother or bullied by her classmates makes us sympathize her.\\n\r\nSachiko Fujinuma, Satoru's mother, is another great character. She has been portrayed as a very honest, caring and courageous mother with high willpower. She cooperates with her son in saving Hinazuki from her mother's abuse and nursed his son for 4 hours daily for 15 years which emphasizes mother's love.\\n\r\nApart from these three characters, Airi Katagiri (a coworker of Satoru in a pizza shop), Kobayashi Kenya (smartest childhood friend of Satoru) etc are a few people who get a little amount of screen time but are still likable.\\n\r\nOn the other hand, I never became much attached to Nakanishi Aya or Sugita Hiromi (other two victims of the serial murders) and most of the other side characters.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nThe idea of putting a supernatural ability like time travel is not a new one. I have seen Steins;Gate, Puella Magi Madoka Magica, Higurashi: When They Cry, Charlotte etc in which the character goes back in time to save his friend again and again. Erased, is actually different than all these titles above. It has a dominant mystery genre which is centered around realistic and old school mystery of serial abduction and murdering which makes it enjoyable. If you are into mystery and detective shows then this anime is pretty much recommended.\\n\r\nIn the initial episodes, the pacing was excellent. The show does an excellent job in creating suspense and leaves us wanting to know more. But in the second half, it starts to feel a little rush, but still it is able to maintain the the quality of it's genre.\\n\r\nErased maintains a good sense of humor which makes it fun to watch. For example, Satoru, in his young form, often speaks something out loud while thinking it which puts him into embarrassing or awkward situations.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nWhile Erased is a very enjoyable anime, it still is far from perfect. There are many things left untold, for example, the origin behind Satoru's ability 'Revival'. And it makes even lesser sense in the whole Erased world that Satoru is the only one having this ability. Infact this ability is the only thing which makes this anime a part of Supernatural genre.\\n\r\nMany realistic and thought provoking philosophical themes are offered by this anime. For example, mother's love for her child, child's love for his mother, frustrated parent's abuse on their child, loneliness in youth age, bullies in school, human's tendency to run away from problems, human's tendency to help other's in need, parent's situation whey their child is in a permanent bed rest for years, and I can go on and on.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTl;dr:\\n\\n\r\n+Very interesting and engaging premise\\n\r\n+Great art and animation style which is suitable for a mystery anime\\n\r\n+Main characters are realistic and interesting\\n\r\n+Great OSTs, OP and ED, excellent voice acting\\n\r\n+Lots of philosophical themes\\n\\n\r\n-Story becomes a little monotonous in the second half\\n\r\n-It starts to feel a little rushed, especially in the last quarter\\n\r\n-Many characters got a very little screentime and character development\\n\r\n-Many things, including the ability 'Revival', are left unexplained\\n\r\n-Sometimes it becomes predictable\\n\\n\\n\r\nErased is an anime, which you must watch this year. Though only one season has ended, I can guarantee that Erased is going to be one of the best, if not the best, anime of 2016. So if you haven't watched it already, then go for it!",

            "content": "~ updated 03/24 ~\r\nEnglish is not my first language so I'm doing my best writing this review, sorry!\r\nSpoilers of the first episodes ahead!\r\n\u2727 Introduction/the story:\r\nSomeone travels through time to save a person he/she cares for. I've already seen this. Madoka Magica, Steins;Gate, Higurashi. No creativity in that aspect, and in the case of Erased it's even worse because the time travel has no explanation at all. This is not a deconstruction and does not present something we have not seen before. This would not matter if the premise was well executed, but this isn't the case either, let me explain why.\r\n\u2727 The characters:\r\nThe MC isa cold, edgy guy that is good on the inside, I'm not saying this is a bad thing, but it makes him cliche and boring. He is also terribly written, acting like the story needs him to act, he goes through traumatic situations as he goes to work every day. This would be excused if this was a fighting shonen, but we are talking about a seinen with mystery and drama. The main character even acts irrationally running out of his house when a neighbour saw him near the body of his mom and thought it was him who killed her, which is quite impossible too, why would he worry about being accused of homicide if there are some little things called inspection of the crime scene and evidence?, of course the MC has no absolutely no reason to kill his own mother, which poses the question: is the police brainless in this world or something?\\n\\n\r\nIn spite of having a 29 year old mind, he still acts like a child most of the time. The excuse given to the viewers is that he wants others to like him (which is kinda contradictory too, because on the first episode he's cold with everyone), for example, instead of asking for all the help he can when he travels to the past, he thinks he can do everything on his own, which is childish and illogical. Nevermind that he is only a bit surprised when he travels 18 years on the past, when he should be extremely confused and overwhelmed by the situation.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters act like soulless robots too, especially the ones that talk to the MC about the murder of his mother like they were talking about the weather, they are also forgettable because most of them act like passive observers.\\n\\n\r\nThe actual kids doesn't talk or act like kids in this show, which takes away all the credibility. For example, there's even a little boy who suspects that the MC is up to something, and when he decides to talk with him, it's like he just read the MC's mind. We are talking about a 10 year old kid, not about a private detective.\\n\\n\r\n\u2727 Satoru's power:\\n\r\nIt's supposed that he \"applies\" his time travel powers to save his mom, but instead of focusing on that, he tries to save a girl he barely knew. Why would he care about her instead of worry more about his mom and his friend? I know the disappearance of the girl and the murder of his mom are kinda related, but there is not a direct factor between the two events, I mean, yes, he can save his classmate, but the kidnapper could abduct any kid they wanted and the events would end up being the same or simmilar.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, if the MC's mind applies the time travel like in the first episode, why didn't this happen when he saw her full of bruises? the time travel has no rules or explanation so the writers can make up anything that is convenient for the plot. You can see the inconstancy of his power only on the first episode.\\n\\n\r\n\u2727 The script:\\n\r\nThis anime also presents some themes through the dialogue, such as depression, or even existentialism, but never explores them properly, it feels like they were put there just to turn the dialogue into something \"out of the ordinary\"\\n\\n\r\nThe show also presents pretentiousness by showing how a girl is hit by her mom, which is not even necessary and it's shock factor, only there for people who get emotionally manipulated easily.\\n\\n\r\nAnd no, the abuse is not there to delve into the psyche of the girl, it's just there to victimize her. These themes need to be explored with more delicacy and should not be thrown in your face like this. If you remove those scenes, the story would remain the same, just implying it with the bruises would have been enough, but no, you need to feel bad for a character about which you know literally nothing more than that she is a cute, but abused child. We can only conclude that this series also fails miserably on the psychological aspect.\\n\\n\r\nErased also fails as a mystery series, because the murderer ends up being really obvious and they don't give us the opportunity of using our minds or feeling excited about the mystery itself because the way that is developed is very hard-set and they never give it too much importance.\\n\\n\r\nThe drama on this anime is also forced and ridiculous sometimes, to the point that they want to convince us that a reason for a divorce could be something as improbable as an accusation of stealing a chocolate bar. And the viewers are supposed to take that seriously and feel bad for the characters. This was also an external excuse for the MC to have an ally.\\n\\n\r\n\u2727 The villains:\\n\r\nAnother aspect in which Erased fails with its writing, are clearly the villains, we have two villains, Kayo's mom and the murderer who killed Satoru's mother and the kids.\\n\\n\r\nFirst, we're going to talk about Kayo's mom:\\n\r\nAt first, the show never gives any reasons for the abuse and Kayo's mom even looks happy while beating her own child. You may say that these things happens in the real world all the time, but that doesn't make them realistic or relatable, because not only was the girl murdered by a psychopath, but she was also abused by her mom with no motives at all.\\n\r\nThere's always a motive behind such acts in real life. For instance, does her mom have a mental illness? in other words, on why her mom hits her and not only on the act of abuse.\\n\r\nThen, when it's already late for delving into real problems or motivations, the show explains in literally two minutes the \"reason\" of her being a abuser, this is presented very superficially and in a way that her, Kayo's mom, ends up being victimized too.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the main villain:\\n\r\nI'm not going to say who they are, but their \"reasons\" for killing little children are also very bad excused through a very morbid metaphor. We never get to know him enough to know his true motives.\\n\\n\r\nPeople who are bad just because, are a big problem.\\n\\n\r\n\u2727 Production values:\\n\r\nThis anime has a very good animation with delicate shadows and a soft color palette that mix perfectly with the bittersweet feeling that the story wants to transmit. It's also very interesting how they put 2 voices on the MC to differentiate between his old mind and his young body.\\n\r\nThe music is on point with the feeling of the characters and it mimetizes perfectly with the way that the characters interact.\\n\\n\r\nThe cinematic effect that shows the memories of the MC is very nice and interesting, but they could have taken more advantage of it. It doesn't fit the story altogether.\\n\\n\r\n\u2727 Conclusion:\\n\r\nThis anime is bad, it has poor theme exploration, it's full of conveniences, plot holes, fails on its psychological aspect and creating a good mystery, the tension and the drama are meaningless and the only good aspects are the production values.",

            "content": "It's becoming more apparent to me by each passing season that if an anime gets any sort of recognition like this, it's bound to divide the community into 2 groups. The majority goes on to ride the hype train and hype the series in question up to the high heavens, while the other hops onto the hate train and then the shit-fest begins. I usually see myself not siding with any of these but frankly, the latter seems more reasonable to me than it ever was. I'll try to offer an unbiased opinion on this even though seeing its rating is kinda baffling. So let'sget into it, the most hyped up anime of the season and quite possibly the most overrated anime of the year (I'm asking to get shot, aren't I?) - Boku dake ga Inai Machi, otherwise known simply as Erased. This review won't spoil anything beyond the first episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe story centers around a 29 year old emo Pizza Hut employee who is trying to become a mangaka. On the other hand, he also has a reset power, \"Revival\", that occurs a few minutes before an accident, lending him the ability to stop said accident before it ever takes place. So yeah, he's basically a Final Destination lead. One day, while stopping an accident from happening he gets injured and in that time his mother moves in to live with him. The next day in Satoru's absence, his mother is stabbed in the back and killed in his apartment by some random guy with a fedora. Do you see the problem here? I said the next day which is quite literally the next day. We don't even get a full episode to get to know or sympathize with this character. Instead we just know her for half of the first episode until she is brutally murdered. Oh no, it's almost like Attack on Titan. Who didn't cry at the first episode of Attack on Titan?!\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, we don't know the man who did it nor do we know his intentions. When Satoru arrives to the crime scene, someone conveniently finds him next to his mother's corpse with blood on his hands. Everything is going downhill for Satoru as the police arrives when he is suddenly, out of nowhere sent 18 years into the past to the year 1988, which at the time he was merely a 10 year old elementary school student. It definitely isn't too far of a stretch to say this is a lame plot device at this point, especially now that he has no control over it. Also, I'd like to mention how further down the line Satoru says that it will be his last Revival. So how does this thing work? Plot convenience, duh.\\n\\n\r\nPrior to this it is also shown that a few kids from Satoru's school were murdered at that time period, namely our loli heroine, Kayo Hinazuki. Hinazuki was a troubled and lonely girl who never got along with anyone and was often abused by her mother. Satoru decides that as well as preventing his mother's death, he will also save Hinazuki before her birthday which is on the 2nd of March. Considering it's already mid February he doesn't have much time. The accused murderer of these kids was 23 year old Jun Shiratori or known to the children simply as Yuuki  due to his courageous nature. He was a person who would always approach the lone students around his house, which already raises a giant red flag. However, Satoru always remembered Yuuki to be a kindhearted and happy guy who would never commit a crime.  \\n\\n\r\nSo obviously the show's primary element is mystery, which I have mixed feelings about. If the mystery is done well it can really lead to a great series, but that usually isn't very easy to pull off and more often that not it just falls flat. The worst mistake a mystery series can make in my eyes is when it raises so many questions but in the end fails to answer them, or maybe just leave it off at a cliffhanger like Rokka no Yuusha. Erased done well in that aspect, seeing as it didn't raise that many questions to begin with. See, what I think is the main problem in Erased's mystery department is the amount of suspects it brings up, or lack thereof. 4 episodes in I was pretty confident in my guess on who the killer was as it was so easy to trace back once you actually think about it. I would of been surprised if my guess was wrong to be totally honest, and that's not because I'm some sort of super-genius.\\n\\n\r\nI seem to have a very obvious bias when it comes to works done by A-1 Pictures. I thought the art style resembled their previous works too strongly and therefore it derived from the series for me as it didn't strike me as dark enough in tone, especially for the kind of series Erased is. So, much like the opening and ending, the art and animation slowly grew on me the further it went on. It's very soothing and visually appealing. Combined with a decent musical direction and atmosphere it even felt cinematic at times.\\n\\n\r\nI wasn't a very big fan of the opening at first to be honest but it gradually grew on me and is easily the best opening of the season and even one of my all-time favorites. That also applies to the ending, it's neat too. As for the OST, I'm indifferent about it. There wasn't anything that struck me as good or above average, it all just felt like regular background music to me but it does it's role, for what it's worth. The voice acting is rather impressive as everyone had a great performance. Seeing as both of Satoru's seiyuu never done any previous work, regarding anime at least impressed me quite a bit. I especially like the guy that does the adult version, his voice is very soothing. Aoi Yuuki was also really good at portraying Hinazuki's character but that is to be expected.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Erased are for the most part incredibly lackluster - from the protagonist to the supporting cast. Because most of the series takes place in the past, a lot of the characters are just 10 year olds, which leads me to my next point - Most of these kids don't even act their age! At parts they act like full-grown adults which really derives from the show, why even bother making them kids in the first place? Looking at you, Kenya, Hinazuki.\\n\\n\r\nSatoru, while being more interesting than your harem protagonist doesn't have that much going for him, which is fine to a point because the characters aren't really where the series shines but his character could have definitely been more solid or maybe had a stronger personality. He doesn't seem like he particularly enjoys the time resets, but he still decides to help out. What a nice guy! The series has a much heavier focus on the past than the present, so for the most part we just get kid Satoru. Well, he's just a normal 30 year old man who's trying to save his 10 year old girlfriend from her seemingly inevitable demise. Sounds about right.\\n\\n\r\nHinazuki is a very reserved and closed off girl but she opens up more and more as the series progresses. She gets abused by her parents for some unknown reason aka SHOCK FACTORRRRR. She suffers from the same problem as Satoru, as she doesn't have a personality that defines her either. Instead (for the most part) we are simply supposed to feel sorry for her and like her because of the predicament she's in. She is pretty cute though - good character.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast is also very lacking, filled with 1-dimensional characters. The reasoning of a lot of characters can be pretty unreasonable and even ludicrous at times - people getting divorced because of a chocolate bar, etc. Then you have characters like Hinazuki's mother who, every time she is on screen tends to turn this show into a misery porn galore. \\n\\n\r\nKenya is another instance of wasted potential. They done as much as they could to make us understand that he is incredibly intelligent and by the end of it all, he barely does anything and his character is awfully utilized. I feel the same way about the killer as I've heard his reasoning is a lot clearer and better explained in the manga. It's not that surprising though as they did try to bash 8 volumes into a 12 episode series. All in all, the characters aren't done very well.\\n\\n\r\nI can sit here all I want and point out the flaws of the show, but truth be told, I had quite a lot of fun with it! I think this is mostly due to how the pacing was handled as it is very fast for pretty much the entirety of the series, yet tends to not feel rushed for the majority of the first half. Only at about the halfway point does the pacing start to affect my outlook on it and turns for the worst. Despite this, I was still entertained for most of the show. The two major downfalls here are the tremendous amount of plot conveniences all throughout the story and the (in my opinion) poorly done mystery.\\n\\n\r\nErased is mediocre in every sense of the word. Despite that, I'd still argue that it's one of the better titles of the season. Does it deserve the hype, praise and to be ranked higher than LotGH? NO. The characters are awfully lackluster + the story is not that great as it has to rely on an iffy plot device and a ton of plot conveniences throughout. I wanted to say that it has more good than bad but A-1 stayed true to their nature and managed to ruin a promising show for me, once again.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I don't think Erased is neither as good as some praise it to be nor as bad as others make it out to be, it's simply average. It's like a rollercoaster and the further you go down, the messier it becomes. However, if you're not a critical watcher and just want to have some fun, Erased is definitely your go-to this season. Sorry in advance if this review gives you suicidal tendencies for not giving it a perfect score.",

            "content": "[Warning: this review will contain vague spoilers]\r\nI was originally not planning in writing anything in regards to this anime in specific, as I thought I had nothing interesting to say about the title. However, after reading the analysis by Zephsilver, I managed to put together some thoughts in regards to Boku Dake ga Inai Machi (or Erased, if you are not fond of tongue-twisters) that I\u2019d like to offer in addition to the debate. I also would like to say: Zeph, I appreciate and respect your text, since it had a rational depiction of your perspective that I could reasonably grasp, but I\u2019d like topolitely disagree.\\n\\n\r\nBefore getting into the review, though, I want to give some context: before the beginning of the winter season I had read the synopsis of Erased and added to my Plan to Watch list, as it seemed mildly interesting. Later, after watching the first two episodes, I was hooked by the premise and highly invested in what could be the outcome of the story. Only then that I got to know about the hype surrounding the series and from that point I witnessed the internet go insane over its score.\\n\\n\r\nStory and Characters\\n\\n\r\nMy reviewing method for this one will be somewhat different from the norm. By the time I\u2019m writing this, the series itself is still surrounded by controversy with two sides with very questionable motivations either raising it as the best thing since Page 3 or clamming it\u2019s an overrated abomination pandering to masses who want to think of themselves as smart (doesn\u2019t that apply to 99% of humanity?). Here, besides commenting of the story and characters within the work, I\u2019ll also discus some of the arguments brought up against Erased and offer my perspective if they are correct in any form or if they hold any water. The first thing I think it\u2019s important to understand is that Erased is, at its core, a very simple story. Besides the time-traveling plot, it has a very streamlined narrative and it is focused almost exclusively on the actions of the main character, in accordance to the fact that he is the \u201cstrange element\u201d in the child timeline (suddenly feels like I\u2019m talking about Zelda!). What it avoids in complexity, it opts to use in character interaction, developing the drama and the motivations that move the story forward. Before I get to the meat of the argument, though, let\u2019s talk about some of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nFujinuma Satoru is the main protagonist. \u201cGifted\u201d with the ability he calls Revival, he can go back a few minutes in time, whenever something bad is about to happen. Detached and constantly feeling unfulfilled, he holds a strong regret due to events of his childhood, when two of his classmates were murdered and one of his friends was incriminated. These feelings lead him to distance himself from his past, but he is forced by a Revival to go back to the days of his childhood in order to prevent those crimes.\\n\\n\r\nHinazuki Kayo is the girl who Satoru wants to prevent from becoming the first victim. Frequently abused by her mother, she avoids interacting with her classmates and is usually seen alone. She initially tries to keep a distance from Satoru, not understanding his motives for trying to get close to her, but his friendly demeanor ends up softening her emotional barriers.\\n\\n\r\nYashiro Gaku is Satoru\u2019s teacher and one of the main agents in the narrative, as he seems interested in solving Kayo\u2019s family situation. Satoru later comments on how Yashiro was an influence to him due to a speech he gave at school, before the story had began, and a specific moment in which Yashiro looked like what Satoru expected his deceased father to be.\\n\\n\r\nShiratori Jun, mostly known as Courage, is an adult who was friends with Satoru in his childhood. Socially awkward and with a heavy stutter, he feels more comfortable interacting with children, which leads him to be framed for the child-murders Satoru tries to prevent. Besides feeding the motivations of the protagonist, the story also uses him to briefly comment in how his inability to be socially active and preferring the company of children led society to misjudge his intentions, especially when Satoru faces a similar situation in the future.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the thriller aspect of the anime is in the center of the driving forces of the narrative, the bulk of the emotional investment Erased strives to build is on the bonding between Satoru and the people he is trying to save, and his motivations within the story. Great focus is given to his interactions with his friends, who with the exception of Ken\u2019ya, who seems unusually mature for someone of his age, are all very believable child characters. By that I don\u2019t mean being as obnoxious as an inch-deep testicle wound, by the way, these kids are actually designed to be likeable. This aspect of the story is built upon until the conclusion, where they play a part in finally getting the killer arrested. Having all of this in mind, let\u2019s tackle some of the complaints about the series.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cThe time travel element is underdeveloped\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThe time travel element is kept simple. Firstly, Satoru\u2019s ability to go back in time is nothing more than a plot device to put him on the track of the murders and since it seems to be simply a supernatural element instead of the usual sci-fi occurring, keeping it simply is a better idea. The story in Erased isn't about time travel, it just features such element as the one necessary for kicking the narrative into motion. Stories that are centered around time travel usually stumble and fall when they decide to flesh out this element without paying proper attention to consistency, which leads to gross plot-holes. Maintaining this element simple and undetailed allows Erased to avoid major inconsistences and focus on the main drive of the story. Also, I know some people were upset by the second instance where Satoru goes back to his child-self as it seemed he had gained control over his ability. To that, I hope you can forgive me stepping out of my polite demeanor for a while to say: For fuck\u2019s sake, that only happened ONCE and it doesn\u2019t even look like he had much control over it! Being it a supernatural ability, and one that seems to have a mind of its own, nonetheless, the event itself isn't so out of place as one might think.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cThe identity of the killer is obvious and the reveal is underwhelming\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThis complaint is one that fans and detractors of the series seem to agree, although in different levels of importance. I mean, the opening itself tells you who it is. The point of contention here is not whether or not the average viewer can easily guess the killer\u2019s identity, but the purpose that such attribute plays in the story. To some, working under the mindset that Erased\u2019s genre is Mystery; such flaw would represent a sign of incompetent use of red-herrings, as well as inability from the writer to effectively create other suspects. In other words, hack writing. Fans of the series, however, work under the mindset that Erased is, in reality, a Thriller. Such idea is supported by an interview with the director of the anime, where he states:\\n\\n\r\n-\t\u201cI see this story as a suspense thriller, or well, a human drama in the guise of a suspense thriller\u201d\\n\\n\r\nBy that definition, the tension within the story would come not from the mystery over the killer\u2019s identity, which is constantly flashed throughout the story, but from the knowledge the audience has in opposition to the cast, since knowing who is the killer would raise tension whenever he and the main characters were close, and that emotion would then culminate when the villain finally reveals itself for the protagonist. Some of his attitudes could be very ambiguous, like the ones at episode 09, but they ultimately filled the role of driving him closer to Satoru, which would then lead to their connection in the years to come, finally bringing his downfall, as Satoru himself had become the killer\u2019s weakness.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cErased becomes an unfocused mess in the latter half\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThis is the one argument to which my response is a categorical NO. Before I get into a fair explanation in relation to that statement, though, let give a better example of how to define lack of focus. For that, I\u2019ll actually give the other face and throw under the bus an anime that just so happens to be one of my favorites, Ergo Proxy, because self-awareness is important. The first 8 episodes of the anime are some of the most tightly written episodes in anime, with barely any line of dialogue wasted and plenty of subtle details in character reactions. Right before the first half, though, the main characters go into a journey looking for the truth behind the main mystery of the series, and from that point on Ergo Proxy adopts a highly experimental structure, focusing plenty of episodes in isolated conflicts tied only to the theme it wanted to address in that specific episode (I apologize for the repetition). Very little of those episodes has connection to the main goal, and when the characters reach their destination it turns out to be a dead end, forcing them to return in order to find the truth. For all of that, it\u2019s not unreasonable to say that Ergo Proxy specifically lacks focus on its narrative. From the point Kayo leaves the center of the plot, Satoru\u2019s objectives change, from saving the girl to protecting the other victims and uncovering the identity of the assassin. As a result, the series follows along with such change and turns its eyes to him, in the same fashion as does the danger of attracting the attention of the villain, just like we would see later on, when Satoru\u2019s actions lead him to be the new target. In that sense, the anime simply shifts its focus, it didn\u2019t lose it and that was the natural root to take. That also leads us to another topic;\\n\\n\r\n\u201cErased lost its charm once Kayo left the picture\u201d\\n\\n\r\nI always found questionable the idea of attributing the entire appeal of a story in a side-character, but that aside, let\u2019s understand this argument: The idea here is that, since the anime spent so much time revolving around Satoru\u2019s efforts to save Kayo, much of the audience\u2019s investment was crafted around the girl, as she would be the one the viewer would immediately want to see shielded from harm. The series does many efforts to frame her in sympathetic light and give her endearing qualities, so when she is moved away from the plot many felt it had wasted their investment. This is a comprehensible thought, indeed, but I believe it ignores another important aspect of fiction: by maintaining focus on a character that has already fulfilled its narrative purpose, the work runs the risk of saturating such character, diminishing the values that made them endearing in the first place and ultimately compromising the story to make room for them. Moving Kayo away from the narrative not only makes sense from a logical point of view, as it completely places her away from the killer, but also preserves her from becoming a hindrance to the story and leaves her character with the emotional baggage that comes at play during the last episodes. There is a merit in avoiding wish-fulfillment if it prevents characters from becoming a problem to the flow of the narrative.\\n\\n\\n\r\n\"The ending is rushed and the villain's motivations are poorly explained\"\\n\\n\r\nThis criticism specifically I can understand on the basis of how the anime progresses in his final episodes, but I\u2019d like to explain the reason for my disagreement by discussing one of the references made by the villain, the spider thread tale. This element is first brought up at the beginning of episode 11, when the antagonist comments that after a specific event during his childhood, he begins to see spider threads hanging above the heads of his victims, in reference to a tale about a criminal who gets the chance to escape from hell using the thread sent by Shakyamuni Bhudda, but is condemned once again when the thread breaks, in punishment for his selfishness. In this tale, the thread was the last source of salvation given by a superior being to a soul in despair, so seeing it above the heads of those he wanted to kill can be interpreted as the antagonist\u2019s desire to be someone above his victims, to be an \u201centity\u201d with the power to condemn or give salvation. When he is finally defeated by Satoru, he sees a spider thread above his own head be torn apart. This is the point when he realizes that he was powerless and susceptible to being manipulated and judged just like his victims, he realizes he\u2019s not an entity in control. By the same line of thought, he takes an interest in Satoru, after the kid survives his first attempt to kill him, because Satoru was the one able to escape his judgment.\\n\\n\r\nPresentation\\n\\n\r\nI believe many of you heard Erased\u2019s visuals being called \u201ccinematic\u201d and that is actually a statement that holds water, as the anime utilizes some techniques of traditional cinema in much more noticeable fashion, a result of the experience the director had working with other professionals like Hosoda Mamoru or Araki Tetsuro, this last one an expert on making anime with mainstream appeal. Now, another term I believe can be applied to the show\u2019s presentation, in general, is minimalistic. The characters are frequently framed in wide shots within the scenery, with the fixed camera giving full comprehension of the environment while the figures are kept small and with minimal action. The purpose of this directing style is to avoid the viewer getting lost in the imagery and lead them to focus only on the details that are relevant to the narrative. In the other hand, it also serves to emphasize emotional moments and heighten the impact of scenes that display a little bit more of flare, giving them a whimsical feel.\\n\\n\r\nA minimalistic presentation, when executed effectively, can suscinctly drive home the emotional core of the scene, and i'd say that Erased uses that method with excelence. This trait also manifests in the characterization, as the shots stealthily introduce certain details and character motivations, like the hero\u2019s Mask in Satoru\u2019s bedroom, to show a figure that inspired him as a kid, or in the manner in which the killer is framed, from the point he\u2019s fully introduced to the brief interactions that hint to his identity, like when the camera is focused upwards, mirroring Satoru\u2019s perspective. These choices of framing serve to cut on the necessity of exposition, reducing the dialogue only to what is essential. This can also be noticed on the sound work: important scenes, like the moment Satoru makes the first impactful contact with Hinazuki, frequently opt for not having soundtrack, driving even more attention to the dialogue and giving full responsibility to the viewer to infer on what is going on between the characters. For an anime that has been accused of being heavy-handed, I\u2019d say this directorial decision is pretty respectful towards the audience.\\n\\n\r\nThe points that feature soundtrack, though, don\u2019t tend to be impressive. Most of the noticeable tracks play their purpose, but are fairly generic, serving only to highlight the specific mood the scene wants to convey. Exceptions would be, of course, the highly catch opening, the fitting and mellow ending, and tracks such as \u201cOnly I am missing\u201d, \u201cI have to save her\u201d, which is brief but very effective at crafting tension despite the upbeat vibe, \u201cReasoning\u201d and \u201cShe was there, alone\u201d. Hum, I\u2019m noticing a pattern here! When it comes to the acting, it\u2019s very consistent with character portrayal and overall quite solid, but one aspect that might raise disagreements, more than usual at least, is Satoru\u2019s voice actor. Despite a solid performance, even taking into consideration it\u2019s his first anime role, Shinnosuke Mitsushima is one of those actors who has a voice that is too singular, which can drive attention away from the acting itself.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Ramblings\\n\\n\r\nI think now we can address some of the external questions related to Erased.\\n\\n\r\nIs Erased the best thing since dark beer? No, I can myself point out more than a handful of titles that are better, without taking away from the anime itself. Was it overhyped? Sure! I mean, it\u2019s hard to refute that an anime getting into MAL\u2019s top 10 before it is even finished is quite a ludicrous event. Is the negativity warranted? My stance, at least, is \u201cnot really\u201d. I believe it\u2019s fair to ask how much of the negativity towards the series is a direct result of its hype, as some people might think it pressures them into a position. I\u2019ve seen even better shows get attacked with far less meaningful arguments, as a result of public opinion being highly favorable towards them, so the attitude itself doesn\u2019t surprise me. The most interesting question, though, seems to be: how did Erased of all anime become so hyped? Think about the most notorious titles of recent years that can be considered overhyped: Attack on Titan was a shounen with focus in drama and a high body count, with an overall gritty setting and story; Kill la Kill was a self-aware ride of nonsensical action with very little restraint; One Punch Man was a parody of superhero tropes centered around fast-paced action and comedy. To think that a slow-paced thriller like Erased, with such an emphasis in children interacting and very little action, would become the hit of the season is a very surprising event. \\n\\n\r\nI must admit that I somewhat enjoyed the polemic surrounding the anime, not so much for how it affected the show itself in the public eye, but because it rings specially close to one of my personal beliefs: fixation on scores is bullshit! People going crazy over one title\u2019s score seemed ludicrous and drove the discussion away from the important elements by turning it into an exercise in group-think. Now you had to rate the show a certain way so that your opinion could be taken seriously by certain sections of the anime community. Now, however, the fires of the flame wars are on the rout to be tamed, so I thought it would be a good idea to offer my perspective on the anime, hoping that it can invoke some respect around.\\n\\n\r\nSince this is the section of the review I leave (specially) dedicated to self-indulgence, I\u2019d like to talk about specific details about Erased that I really like: I like Satoru\u2019s interactions with his mom as a child, showcasing that he still cared for her, even with the distance between them in his adult self; I like his interactions with his friends, both as a child and as an adult, when we can see the contrast their relationship takes; I like the lack of control Satoru has when talking as a child, showing the disconnect between his body and his mind; I like the meaning the title takes at the end of the series; I like the whimsical moments between Satoru and Hinazuki, which really drove home the meaning of his actions even at short term; I like the childishly awesome lines Satoru\u2019s friends said; I like when he reads the text he had written as  child, about his favorite hero; I like it, simple as that. \\n\\n\r\nWith this review I don\u2019t aim to change people\u2019s opinions or scores about Erased (although if it leads more people to give the show a try it would be really cool!), I hope simply to showcase how this opinion in specific can be valid, because as minimalistic of a story as it was, it did something for me, and for that I appreciate it.",

            "content": "With any established community there are traditions that take fruition from within it. And when it comes to the anime community that tradition can be seen with the ritualistic assignment of labels that is accompanied with every new seasonal lineup. Each season's catalog is cherry-picked through by the ascending masses to be filed away in neat little categories that're decided by whatever the common consensus is at that time. And it's thanks to this unspoken system that we get our \"anime of the season,\" \"hidden gems\" and \"BURN WITH FIRE\" shows that, for the most part, seems to be what the general audience agree upon.But among these rank-and-filed titles, we always have at least one show that splits the community into opposing camps; with one side exalting it as the next best thing since sliced bread and the other side wanting its head on a stick. These contentious titles ignite the embers of flame wars across several forums and opens the floodgates for keyboard warriors to caps lock the hell out of each other. These are often the most \"hyped\" show for that given season and tend to remain that way long after its airtime. Ladies and gentlemen, Boku dake ga Inai Machi (or Erased) is without question that title for Winter 2016. \\n\\n\r\nIf I was to give a very brief overview of Erased it would be this: engaging 1st half, deplorable 2nd half. \\n\\n\r\nErased is the type of show that will get under many peoples' skins. There are titles, that upon a 1st glance, you could easily deduce that it will be no better than B-grade schlock, and then there's shows that genuinely get your interest. For most, Erased will be the latter. With a somewhat firm grasp on cinematography, color placement and all around competency in crafting a grounded setting, Erased upon initial viewing, appeared to be one of the most promising prospects from Winter 2016. It exuded this feeling of self-control over its actions that became quite easy to buy into. A reassuring appearance that it will be a smooth ride from start to finish. The reason these kind of titles are more bothersome as opposed to the shows that are instantly identified as bottom-rung, is that with lesser tier titles, there's no expectations set for it. When I view an \"Akame Ga Kill\" or \"Asterisk War\" level show, quality is the last thing that comes to mind. I know as a viewer that what I'm getting ready to watch will, at its very best, be easily digestible excerpts of things I've seen done far better. On the other hand, shows that allure me into anticipating something far more substantial carries with it a higher sense of investment. So when these titles fall under their own weight, it packs a bigger punch. As a viewer, there's nothing more disheartening to witness than untapped potential being flushed down the toilet. And like its namesake, Erased \"erased\" any chances of being herald as anything more than a novelty act. \\n\\n\r\nInstead of reciting the synopsis I'll go right into addressing where Erased showed commendable effort and how it eventually unraveled into a hokey hogwash. \\n\\n\r\nTime-travel as a plot device in any story can be a fickle thing to work with, the slightest overuse or tampering of it to alleviate inevitable conclusions can quickly result in audience backlash with the collective chant of \"bullshit!\" being ushered out in response. The best use of time-travel is really not using time-travel at all but there's a reason why it's still a compelling tool for writers to dabble with. It can open up scenarios and prospects that previously were made unavailable in the conventions of regular stories. So the reasonable solution for those instances is finding restraint in when and how time-travel is used in the confines of the narrative being presented. This was an area that Erased seemed to have covered relativity well. The main character can jump back in time a few minutes before something tragic happened, as stated by the synopsis. What made this use of time-travel welcoming was that despite this ability, he himself has no true control over these time jump occurrences; the option to jump at will is out of his hands. With this stipulation set in place, Erased found a reasonable limitation to work with. It eliminated the misuse of time-travel by the protagonist to retcon any events whenever the writer sees fit. But as you may have surmised by my statements regarding this show's 2nd half, this established restraint doesn't remain constant, and that spells the first major misstep of the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe second major catalyst that crippled Erased was its genre itself. Marketed as a mystery anime, Erased spent a great deal of time foraging through its settings and characters living in it. This is what indirectly set up the first half to seem so promising. There were layers of detail being caked onto the \"mystery\" story, which helps to better define it to the audience. Erased felt like a place not too far out of reach from our own world, thanks in no small part to the extra time dedicated to making the experience as cinematic as possible. With widescreen angles (Letterboxing) implemented in certain crucial moments, to off-kilter camera angles that helped express messages without the need for expository dialogue, everything the show was doing up to a certain point showed a level of quality not often seen in the anime industry. It was able to build suspense using music cues and proper lighting, giving life to its mystery through comprehensible visual motifs and proper use of color placement. The show expressed capabilities far more common in the world of cinema than what anime usually dabbles with. It's for reasons like these that many flocked to it, labeling it as one of the best without so much as to second guess their stance. And ultimately it's this that also fended off proper judgment for the far inferior 2nd half. The frenzy was too high for rationality to kick in. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the quality of the show's visual and audible presentation remained relatively consistent, the same could not be said about the writing. When I mentioned the show's genre being a detriment, this is where that becomes apparent. With the primary genre being \"mystery,\" one would think a great deal of time would be dedicated to making that aspect as foolproof as possible, but what we got was nothing short of underwhelming. To those unfamiliar with the purpose of a 'red herring' in a story, it's something or someone that's manifested and exists for the purpose of misleading the viewer from the truth. It's like the slight of hand trick practiced by a magician, while the real action is happening out of sight. A red herring isn't supposed to be your answer but rather a falsehood that takes on the shape of an answer. In a mystery story, red herrings are those clues that lead to a dead end, or the suspects surrounding the true culprit that detracts the viewer from the correct answer. At no time is a red herring suppose to be a final conclusion. Even when there is an attempt to subvert this fact, all that does is make what appears to be the \"truth\" to be nothing more than another red herring in disguise. So when Erased effectively missed this fundamental fact, it is nothing short of baffling. \\n\r\nIn what was an attempt to curve the obvious fake out into the actual truth, Erased single-handily shot itself in the foot. These are the actions of a satire that pokes fun of the genre, not a show that is a part of it, which made the mystery of Erased to be an unintentional joke to those keen to this fact and an underwhelming reveal to those still infatuated with the show up to that point. No one walks out a winner, both cynics and fans alike lose in this situation. Had Erased place in some kind of deviation from the elephant in the room this wouldn't be a problem but poor planning sadly killed those chances. This anime was one script revision away from being passable. \\n\\n\r\nEven if one was to view the show as a thriller (a very common excuse used by detractors that stand against the title's criticisms), it still doesn't hold much merit. A thriller, like its namesake would imply, is a genre that's supposed to \"thrill\" the audience with an exciting, often intense plot, where the tension feels ever-present and a sense of urgency is placed on the viewer for the character's well-being. It's wound up dread followed by cathartic release. A very textbook component that's the backbone of any successful thriller. That being said, it's hard to be \"thrilled\" when the narrative makes irrational decisions that quickly breaks immersion, or deflate any tension that was built up with an anticlimactic conclusion. You're supposed to be in a state of nervous anticipation as to the outcome of a storyline, not scratching your head questioning the leaps in logic of said outcome. If a convenient ticket out of every impending danger is offered to the characters, then how could their predicament be anything short of a temporary bump in the road? Without a proper end result to any build-up, the show is essentially leaving you mentally flaccid. When a show continuously makes decisions that negate risk or impending danger, then it ceases to lack consequence in the eyes of the viewer. A thriller with no substantial consequence is like a mystery with no red herrings; and wouldn't you know it, Erased ended up being insufficient in both aspects.\\n\\n\r\nThis half-baked writing also seeped its way into the visual presentation, as the show's ineptitude in handling its symbolism and motifs became quickly apparent. What is important to note is the proper usage of these elements in a story and not the actual meaning of said elements. In any form of grounded storytelling, symbolism and motifs are suppose to be implemented with finesse. They're placed there to add subtext to what is being presented at face value. They're things that don't necessarily need to be identified to properly understand what you're watching, but upon analytical inspection, adds a new layer of meaning to what is presented on screen or implied in the narrative. To put it in layman's terms, they're like brownie points for those that dig deeper into the subject matter they're presented with. That being said, when these literary devices are spoon fed to the audience, it defeats the purpose of their usage. At that point, it's no longer a praiseworthy effort, but something that's equally detestable with the likes of lazily implemented expository dialogue. It's the difference between letting the visuals and action speak for themselves, oppose to beating the audience over the head with the obvious answer (Yes MothersBasement, red = danger.. In other news, cows go moo). Something being symbolic doesn't inherently make it good, an aspect that Erased failed to comprehend. \\n\\n\r\nAnd like a snowball effect, all these shortcomings kept on culminating into something far too glaring to be rectified. This brings us to the conclusion of the plot in the show's 1st half, which saw our protagonist Satoru muster everything in his power to protect Kayo. All of the show's efforts were slowly crafted around this plot. It was a gradual buildup to Kayo's revelation in the story. This brought with it the show's best efforts. Viewers were swayed into investing in this conflict, which became more gripping by each new episode. \"Will Satoru finally save her?\" \"Would his efforts be in vain?\"; these and many more questions were raised along with the stakes as things drew closer to its final destination. And after all the layers of suspense, all that attachment, all that investing... the conclusion quickly deflated in value by a poorly-realized, rushed solution that saw a character be re-written and patronized, while simultaneously removing one of the central focuses from the story entirely. So when one of the biggest investments for many viewers were removed from the equation, all these aforementioned issues that were initially dismissed, no longer had anything to hide behind. The shit was out in the open, it was just a matter of stepping back to finally realize it.\\n\\n\r\nIf I had to say what the biggest issue with Erased was it would be that all of the great aspects of it, all of the promises it made, and all of the standards that it set, was quickly counteracted by the occurrence of everything in the 2nd half. While the same issues were also there in the 1st act, it was never made apparent when the show pulled focus away from it. For every high point that Erased offered, an equally appalling low point balanced it out. It was a duality that kept it from being any better than where it ultimately ended up in the end.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nFor the first 6 episodes or so Erased was quite the enjoyable experience. I was invested in the conflict, I wanted to see the protagonist succeed, as well as uncover the mystery surrounding the killer. The show had my interest. But just as quickly as it drew me in, it lost me with the same speed. The 2nd half of Erased is nothing short of painfully mediocre to intellectually insulting. It was disappointing to see what it could have been, and how it turned out instead.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nErased could have been great, what it did well it did exceedingly well, the potential was there in ample proportions. But almost like a countermeasure, when it faltered it didn't just trip a little before catching itself, no, when it fumbled, it pretty much fell down a flight of stairs, breaking every bone on its way down. So do I recommend Erased even with acknowledgment of this? Yes, I do. Despite what trouble it had, later on, the 1st half was enjoyable enough to still warrant giving it a try.

The characters aren't too overwhelming or annoying and the pacing is nice. The story line is great also. \r\nSome elements of the story may seem predictable at times but that's only if you really pay attention to the details. The ending was memorable and left you feeling complete which truly made this anime stand out from many others.\r\nOverall, I recommend this anime if you haven't already seen it but I'm sure you have since it's beeneverywhere for the past 3 months. One of the best anime of the winter season",

            "content": "Ever felt like you made a big mistake in life and wanted to fix it? Or perhaps you just want things to go in the right direction if given another chance? Most people will never get that sort of opportunity. But for a guy named Satoru Fujinuma, that\u2019s another story. His ability, Revival is pretty much a gift that allows him to travel back in time with his memories. So in essence, the guy can basically fix mistakes in his life with a second opportunity. Actually, I should probably rephrase that. What he has isn\u2019t just a gift but also a responsibility. The ability totime travel is an extraordinary power but it also comes with a lot of responsibility because in this story, Satoru has an encounter with a very experienced killer that puts him, his friends, and family at risk.\\n\\n\r\nBased on the manga, Boku dake Ini Machi (also known as Erased) is a psychological thriller. Adapted by A-1 Pictures, the series chronicles Satoru\u2019s life and his responsibilities to avert certain events. From the first episode, we see that he is a rather cynical man who seems indifferent about every day events except when there\u2019s some sort of oddity or strange event happening. As one of these events, Satoru encounters a bizarre instance when an unknown man emerges from his neighborhood. This apparently has connections with a series of murders in his community that also includes the death of a family member. I guess it\u2019s easy to tell what comes next as Satoru uses his Revival ability to avert such a tragedy. The problem? The unknown man/killer is very experienced so it takes much more than just time travel to prevent such a tragedy.\\n\\n\r\nNow I have to admit, this series has quite an intriguing premise. The idea of being able to witness events again and being able to fix them sets up a lot of plot planning for Satoru. The first few episodes establishes this as we see how events are constructed based on memories and narratives. What\u2019s interesting to see is how Satoru sees his own past. It\u2019s noticeable because of how the past relationship he shares with his mother is a bit different from the one we see in the future. In essence, Satoru begins to realize how happy he was and attempts to forge a stronger relationship with his mother. This is sharp contrast to Kayo Hinazuki, a lonely girl in the past timeline. Kayo\u2019s mother is the antithesis of a good parent. She is manipulative, abusive, foul mouthed, and treats her daughter like her property. Furthermore, her role in the story seems to be influence Kayo\u2019s personality as she becomes like a hollow shell. Of course, that does change once Satoru appears in her life. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the stronger dynamics of the series is the relationship and chemistry between certain characters. Besides Satoru and his mother, Satoru and Kayo easily has the most prominent relationship. From strangers to allies to friends, the two builds trust and a tight connection. At first, it\u2019s not easy because of how other students in the class also ostracizes Kayo. However, Satoru is able to break down her barrier of solitude. This is achieved by standing up to her bullies, treating her with kindness, and even confronting Kayo\u2019s mother as a way to show her wrongful deeds. In essence, this naturally allows Kayo to open up more and show her own cheerful side. At times, it\u2019s easy to see that Kayo\u2019s personality seems to be a bit of a reflection of Satoru in the future timeline. This also brings out Satoru\u2019s character as he realizes his own weakness at times as he feels powerless to stop certain events from time to time. \\n\\n\r\nAnother one of Satoru\u2019s important relationships is the one he shares with his friends, most importantly Kenya. Despite being a supporting character, he helps Satoru and is able to deduce certain abnormalities with his cunning mind. His strong sense of justice also inspires Satoru to stop crimes from happening especially to find the crafty killer in both the past and present. Despite this, I do think some relationships suffers. Satoru and Airi\u2019s relationship in the show is less noticeable and seems to be only based on trust. While it share similarity with Satoru/Kayo, it doesn\u2019t have the amount of emotional appeal. Even during one scenario where Airi\u2019s life is in danger, it feels like the show doesn\u2019t really appeal more than just the typical \u201cSatoru jumps in to save the day\u201d. Similarly, Satoru\u2019s relationship with his teacher is also based on trust as he seems to be one of the few adults that he can rely on. In essence, trust is a controversial part of the series as well because in the end, events that happens in the story isn\u2019t always what they seem.\\n\\n\r\nBy the time you\u2019ve watched 1/3 of the show, it\u2019s easy to tell that the series is very story centric. Every episode builds on more and more with the construction of events, the descriptive narratives from Satoru\u2019s point of view, and how important events influence one another. Satoru\u2019s revival ability creates opportunities, not just for himself but others too. Unfortunately, the killer is also a very crafty individual so they often plan ahead to strategically carry out their goals. This leads to Satoru\u2019s trouble with the law as he finds himself powerless at times. This is one of the weaknesses of the series. Satoru\u2019s motivation is to save certain people but he is sometimes unable to save himself. The weakness here is that we may feel that Satoru relies too much on himself rather than others, at least for a good portion of the story. Remember, Satoru only has the pieces of the past that he sees clearly but not always the solutions. Speaking of story, the show is also a bit predictable. Despite being labeled as a thrilling mystery, it\u2019s not difficult to predict who the killer is. On the other hand, there\u2019s also the idea about the motives. It will get the viewers to ask why certain people acts according to their actions. This includes Kayo\u2019s parents, friends, and obviously the killer himself. Also on a technical note, the series is only adapted into a 1-cour so expect a compressed adaptation. There are certain events that is omitted from the manga to speed up the pace while trying to keep the story as credible as possible. \\n\\n\r\nOn the visual front, the series has some pretty good quality. There\u2019s a lot of foreshadowing so the show is able to carefully piece together with clever camera angles, in particular with the moving framework. Even the show itself presents itself like a movie cinema, which is a reason why I\u2019d recommend watching the show on a big screen. In addition, character designs are very stellar to create the thrilling mood. The atmospheric feel of the show is delivered by the character expressions to show their personalities from the compassionate mother Sachiko, stoic Kayo, or the casual friend Airi. The killer is the also most noticeable in the show with his red eyes to reflect his dark twisted desires. Another character that stand out part is Sachiko with her signature lips, a distinctive way to show her as a prominent adult in the series.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack is another strong dynamic of the series. Yuki Kaijura helms the series composition and is fairly well known for her ability to create a thrilling atmosphere. This is accomplished by the fine details of eerie music especially during suspenseful scenes. Furthermore, there\u2019s the OP and ED theme songs with not just foreshadowing but also elements of mystery. Another noticeable part about the show is the character voices. Now obviously, there\u2019s a sharp contrast in voice tone between Satoru\u2019s present and future self because of the age gap. However, the praise should go to Shinnosuke Mitsushima, a newcomer with his ability to portray Satoru. \\n\\n\r\nBoku dake ga Inai Machi is far from a masterpiece. The story is predictable and despite a good amount of characterization, certain characters can be easily forgettable. Furthermore, time travel isn\u2019t a new concept as series such as Steins;Gate, The Girl Who Leapt Through Time, and even Zetusen no Tempest has dived into such themes. However, it\u2019s still a thrilling series mostly with how it keeps the audience at their seat. We want to see Satoru succeed and each episode builds more and more on that. The relationship dynamics remains one of the most prominent concepts of the series and it easily brings the story to life. From the past to the present, it shows how characters progress with fine details through storytelling. And speaking of fine details, the production team really did put a good amount of effort in the visual quality and soundtrack. As for a show like this, it\u2019s about embracing the story and see what it has to offer. If you\u2019re a fan of that, then there\u2019s a lot to look into to.",

I've never written a review before, but now I do, because this anime really earned it.\r\nEverything about this anime has a unique atmosphere which you can feel from the first episode.\r\nStory:\r\nSome people like to compare this anime to Stein's Gate because it involves some time travelling. Other people wondered about the mystery and crime genre and compared it to Death Note. This anime is neither of them. It doesn't revolve around time travelling as the main idea or the plot of the story. Also, it doesn't involve that much darkness andcrime twist as Death Note.\\n\r\nIt is about loneliness and friendship, courage and hesitation, evil and good, family and abuse; It is about a lot.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art in the anime is much better than the manga.

            "content": "\"Everything will eventually rot away. As long as the factor of time continues being the apex predator of the universe, the inevitable decay of all pain and memory is unstoppable.\" - Overpriced Mac computer\r\nIn the beginning of 2016 an anime with an absurd rating  popped out of nowhere on Mal's top list.That anime was ofcoarse Boku dake ga Inai Machi.Being the tea-drinking gentleman that i am,i've disregarded it as the Oscars did with Edward Norton,but lately i've mustered some fate in humanity and decided to give the short 12 episode mystery a chance.\r\nThe story centers arounda 29 year old pizzaman (sadly that is not Kenji the Enji) trying to become mangaka,while also having convenient time traveling powers given to him by the Magical Space Jesus,that only work when they are needed for the plot.\\n\r\nOne day,while driving his fancy pizzamobile,he sees a speeding vehicle going towards a little kid and much like a certain protagonist from Yu Yu Hakusho he decides to be the hero.While managing to save the kid he also ends up being in a hospital.After being released his mom decides to live with him and on the next day in his absence  she gets stabbed to death by a shady looking character wearing fedora.When he returns and finds her body some woman conveniently sees him and calls police.The police  then assumes him as the prime suspect,but instead of clearing his name,he runs away from them,using his inexplicable time traveling powers given to him by the Magical Space Jesus to go back in time,precisely 18 years ago and find and prevent the killer from killing his mother.But to do so by his logic he must become someone else,he must become something else.That something is his 11 year old self,By doing that he assumes that if he prevents the kidnapping of a classmate of his - Kayo,he will exculpate his friend who was originally framed for the kidnapping and sentenced to death,leaving the real perpetrator free to kill his mom in the future.So he decides to get friendly with her until the day of her kidnapping,giving a weird uncomfortable pedo vibe.\\n\r\nBut the thing is,it really didn't matter which kid would the killed choose to as his victim.Making the entire effort pointless if the wasn't convenient for the plot the killer to be someone that Satoru knows from 18 years ago.\\n\r\nAnother thing thing i want to mention is that the emotional scenes in this particular \"gem\" are probably the worse i've seen in just about anything.I've laughed in every single supposed sad scene there was.\\n\\n\r\nCharacterization is probably the biggest flaw in Boku dake ga Inai Machi. The characters are irritating, flat, inconsistent, contrived, and they alone destroy any possibility of this being even a decent anime..\\n\r\nEvery single one of them is a bland plot device which acts anyway the plot wants them to act and without a doubt will be forgotten in the next 2 months or so.You really can't tell which one is worse or best since they all suck.\\n\r\nBut ofcoarse then most noticable one is the one with the most screen time.That ofcoarse is Satoru.He makes really illogical actions in just about every episode.\\n\r\nThe other main character for the majority of the series is Kayo.For the sake of shock factor,she is abused by her one dimentional evil mother, a fact which all the adults around her are aware of,but are unable to do anything about. Child Protective services had attempted to deal with the situation but were unable to gain any concrete proof or even set up a meeting.\\n\r\nDue to this abuse, she's a social outcast at school, preferring to distance herself from other people, hoping that if she wears the mask of apathy long enough, it will become real. After school, she spends her time mostly alone at a local park until 6 P.M., to avoid going home and facing her mother.\\n\r\nThe killer is an absolute copy of Mark Jefferson,except that his plans make no sense at all and unlike the charismatic Life is Strange villain,he is very predictable and his motivations are non-existent.\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters's personalities can be deducted from their character designs alone.It was like they weren't real life people, with their own mindsets and ideas.\\n\r\nAlthough the ending wasn't bad,although extremely cheese and predictable,because of the poor character development it didn't manage to become paramount.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation as avarage as it gets for this damn age !Nothing more to be said.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was as bland as the characters which in this case is a good thing.\\n\r\nThe ost was pretty meh.It didn't make my ears bleed nor did it impress me,so it's between avarage and fine.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough having avarage Sound and avarage animation,this anime had MAJOR phasing problem,rushing until the very end,failing to emotionally connect the viewer to the characters and some''genius'' mind though using monologues to the point of beating a dead horse.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nBoku dake ga Inai Machi is one of the dumbest show to ever take itself seriously. It is essentially a hackneyed amalgamation of cliches and overused plot devices that clumsily attempts to disguise itself as something greater.\\n\r\nWatch Boku dake ga Inai Machi if you have a weird Deus ex Machina fetish, but otherwise stay away. It does nothing new and it does nothing well. It doesn\u2019t even fail in an interesting or original way, destroying any chance for campy \"so-bad-it's-good\" appeal. As a result, I can't think of a single positive thing to say about it, and I have no choice but to give it a 2. \\n\\n\r\nMoral of this is.....\\n\r\nIt's time to stop!It's time to stop!Ok?No more!Where are your parents!?Who are your parents ?I'm gonna call Child Protective services!It's time to stop !\\n\\n\r\nFor some actually good anime that revolves around Time travel i point you not towards Steins;Gate,because chances are that you've already watched it,but towards Noein.Not one of my personal favourites tho,but it did everything that Boku dake ga Inai Machi failed to do with flying colours.Even Crispin Freeman is in it.Who doesn't like Crispin Freeman ?Nobody!",

            "content": "Erased follows Satoru, a jaded pizza boy and struggling manga artist who plays vigilante after connecting a string of murders that took place during his childhood. Like all pizza boys, Satoru is burdened with the ability to time travel, an ability which automatically activates whenever someone in his immediate vicinity is nearing fatal danger, allowing him to save lives.\r\nIt's established within the first episode that this is an ability that lets him travel 1-5 minutes into the past to prevent something bad from happening, yet, when he comes home to find that his mother has been murdered and the unknown assailant has set him upby calling the police and promptly leaving the crime scene, this ability triggers Satoru to travel back into the body of his 8 year old self for reasons the show never explains.\\n\r\nOf course, this show's advocates would probably argue that in this particular incident his life was in danger so the rule established in the first place doesn't necessarily apply to the situation- but then, a few episodes later, Satoru, now using the opportunity he's been bestowed with to prevent tragedies which he had previously been unable to, namely the murder of a little girl called Hinazuki Kayo, sees what he believes to be another her blooded clothes tied up into a bag after her disappearance, and then proceeds to run away yelling at the top of his lungs, travelling back to present day where he is being tailed by the police despite being in no immediate danger. \\n\r\nA few more episodes in, Satoru then time travels back to being a child again while he's being arrested for the murder he was framed for, because he tried really hard I guess.\\n\r\nBy refusing to establish boundaries for this ability, the writer allows himself  to cop out of any situation and in the process removes all the tension the show would otherwise have had, a painfully clear way of forcing plot progression when the writer shoots himself in the foot.\\n\\n\r\nDespite this, the show garnered quick attention as flavour of the month for the spring 2016 season, and was praised by many for its cliffhangers, the same things that are rendered completely inconsequential due to what is arguably the show's central element of the \"revival\". This isn't just removing the stakes, it's completely fucking obliterating them; if you look through the episodes that have cliffhangers, it's not long before a pattern emerges either.\\n\r\nIn episode 1, Satoru is framed for the murder of his mother and met by the police before experiencing what we can assume is his first revival of more than 5 minutes.\\n\r\nEpisode 4 has kid-satoru walk into class to find that Hinazuki has gone missing.\\n\r\nEpisode 5 has one of Satoru's coworkers trap herself, after opening a door to a room that is clearly on fire because plot, and faint.\\n\r\nBy the end of episode 6, Satoru is back in present day and gets arrested for the suspected murder of his mother.\\n\r\nAnd in episode 7, the show teases that the murderer is about to find Hinazuki again.\\n\r\nAfter the murderer is revealed in episode 10, Satoru is left drowning in ice cold water (oh shit dude how's he going to get his way out of this one)\\n\\n\r\nAll of these \"cliffhangers\" are solved with he flick of a switch once the protagonist time travels, and have no long term consequences whatsoever.\\n\r\nIn most Mystery/Thriller shows, or just any show that is trying to create dramatic tension in general, you'd expect the creators to have a certain amount of tricks up their sleeve to play around with as the show progresses, usually through withholding or teasing certain pieces of information and then revealing them later down the line. Erased doesn't just do this poorly, it barely has the initial tools to do this to begin with, which is why it has to rely on cheap cliffhangers that, beyond their immediate shock factor mean n-o-t-h-i-n-g with the presence of the revival.\\n\\n\r\nEven ignoring the writing crime that is the \"revival\", the mystery itself has little to offer at least as far as guesswork is concerned, it's frustratingly obvious that the killer is the teacher- when I first saw the teacher tap Satoru on the back and the camera panned up to his towering body as he glared at Satoru with a smirk on his face and red-tinted eyes it was such an unsubtle way of implying he was the bad guy that I thought that he HAD to be a red herring, but nope, he's the baddy. It's not like the show makes any effort to conceal the fact he's the killer either, with him being one of only two adult male characters that get any significant screen time in the revival episodes, the other of which has long blonde hair and looks nothing like the killer in the short glimpse we get of him in the first episode.\\n\r\nSome people would argue that it's about the \"why\" and not the \"who\", and that this may have even been the show's intention, but then I'd have to ask, why can't it be both?\\n\r\nI'm not suggesting that the show needed a ridiculous number of red herrings, that too would get obnoxious after a while, but I don't think it's wrong to expect at least ONE scene, one line of dialogue, one piece of information, one character to throw us off the tracks of the killer.\\n\r\nEven the creator himself when interviewed said he sees the show as \"a human drama disguised as a suspense thriller\", suggesting he did in fact intend for it to be obvious that the killer was the teacher.\\n\r\nBut then again, this is the same director that said his two favourite things about the show are its \"suspense\" and \"scenes that make you think Kayo is cute\", so I take that statement with a pinch of salt.\\n\r\nIt's not like the killer's motivation is particularly interesting either, the show briefly touches on his childhood and some story about him killing hamsters, but little else is done to help with the pay off for our all important \"why\". \\n\\n\r\nIf the intention was to make the killer's identity obvious, then why did they give him such a flat backstory and barely explore his character? I get that it's supposed to be ironic that Satoru was next to the killer all along- but dramatic irony can't carry the show on its own whether you consider it to be a mystery or not, the teacher doesn't get nearly enough focus, his motivation was clich\u00e9 and his method of killing victims was boring, his character was inconsistent, meandering between intelligent and idiotic, and some still claim that \"this was the point\".\\n\\n\r\nHaving returned to his childhood for the second time in the show, Satoru now approaches the situation from a different angle and begins to take more of an active role in protecting Hinazuki and discovering the identity of the killer, successfully saving her by ensuring she in the custody of her Grandma after exposing her parents as abusive, because apparently that would stop the killer from targeting her, even though, if anything, having an elderly woman as her only direct form of protection would make it easier for the killer to target her. It's clearly implied ol' teach is seemingly indiscriminate with the kids he kills, his only criteria being that they have a spider thread on their head, which we can assume is a delusion, a twisted way of rationalising his actions, so why wouldn't the teacher continue to pursue Kayo? He's her teacher for fuck's sake he's like the one person outside of the  people who relocated her that would still have access to her information.\\n\\n\r\nWhich brings me to the next glaring issue, how are any of Satoru's actions helping with the situation at hand? Sure he's ensuring the three victims the killer originally targeted are safe leading up to the date they originally died, but that isn't going to stop teach from going after them at a later date, or even other children, in fact, the show doesn't try to hide this, there's even a few short scenes where we see him trying to target another girl outside of the three Satoru knows died in his timeline.\\n\r\nIf that wasn't ridiculous enough, after a few shenanigans with some of the non-Kayo children that Satoru tries to save, the teacher catches on to Satoru and straight-up drowns him by strapping him into a car with a seatbelt (genius) and rolling the car into a freezing lake with a basketball after convincing him to get into his car to find a girl that was missing when in actuality she wasn't.\\n\r\nThis far into the show, the natural assumption would be that Satoru would  time travel back into the future, but I guess even the writer was tired of the plot device, because with no explanation whatsoever, Satoru goes into a coma and wakes up fifteen years later. (so pretty much a revival but with the added drama of amnesia) \\n\r\nBut what about the car? Satoru was drowning in freezing water, who saved him? The teacher was the only one there, did he save him? If so why? If not who did? And how did they get to Satoru in time to save him while still providing enough time for the killer to escape? A character claims in the final episode that there was \"no evidence\", why was there no evidence? We're told by the teacher that he has multiple cars- but they all look the same, does no one in the show pick up on that after Satoru goes into the coma? What about eyewitnesses, did no one see them leave in the car together? Something tells me the show doesn't know the answer to any of these questions.\\n\\n\r\nWith such a ridiculously vague way of concluding the \"revival\" scenes, I'm gonna spitball and say that the writer realised that, should he have Satoru escape with a \"revival\", Satoru wouldn't have protected any of the children in the first place, and the story would be back to square one- so the chances are he realised there were only two ways to avoid this dead end; either have Satoru somehow escape the killer and live out the rest of those 15 years to get the show back into present day, or get there nice and quick by shoving him in a coma, and the latter is infinitely easier to \"pull off\" and has infinitely more \"thrilling moments\" to be pulled out of its ass, so naturally that was the choice.\\n\r\nIt's one thing to assume that the killer wouldn't target other children during the revival scenes, but now we're supposed to believe that 15 years have passed and he hasn't been busted for the attempted murder of Satoru? I guess the show also wants you to deny the idea that the teacher would have killed anyone else during this long stretch of time, although it does make sure to throw in the implication that he's grooming a little girl leukemia patient.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, with Satoru having regained his memories, the final confrontation begins and teach takes a wheelchair-bound Satoru up to the roof of the hospital they are in.\\n\r\nTeach is shown to have every intention to kill Satoru, even going as far as to send a fake suicide message to Satoru's mother; but then Satoru catches him off guard by wheeling himself to the edge of the roof, threatening to kill himself, prompting the teacher to confront the possibility that he'd never wanted to live without Satoru in the first place.\\n\r\nI guess the idea was that he'd started fixating on Satoru somewhere down the line and decided he couldn't live without him. That's not really a problem in itself, I can dig a good crazy character, a quality love/hate relationship between an antagonist and the protagonist, but every scene up until this point had pointed towards the idea that this man was every bit as calculating as he was cold, this slowly deteriorates towards the end when he starts reciting his \"evil plans\" to Satoru on their way to the lake, but It's the nail in the coffin to have this guy who seemed to have his hand in all the pies go on to fuck up so badly. Not to mention it's barely tangible with his character.\\n\\n\r\nTo add insult to injury, the entirety of this shoddily realised premise is the result of the pure coincidence that Satoru's mother happened to notice the murderer in the act of abducting a little girl, not the protagonist, not intentionally, but the unintentional observation of a side character that dies in the SAME EPISODE (although admittedly she gets a little more screen time after this due to the time travel).\\n\\n\r\nSurely it would have been far more solid of a concept to have the protagonist actively search for the killer (considering he begins to research into the matter after remembering the incident in his childhood anyway), and then have HIM discover the murderer abducting a child, have the murderer notice HIM observing his actions, and then have the murderer go to his house to kill him, only to find the mother there alone instead because Satoru was still at the pizza store and kill her instead. Not only would this solve the issue of the show's reliance on coincidence, but it would also have meant that when the MC found his mother dead on the floor and got caught by the police, his revival to his childhood could have instead focused on the fact that he knew the identity of the killer, but is near helpless to deal with them due to the limitations of being in a child's body and the fact that if he attempts to directly confront the killer, he would risk exposing himself, putting his and his mother's life in danger, and wasting the one chance he has to rekindle his relationship with his her.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10\\n\r\nBeyond his ability, Satoru isn't ground-breakingly interesting, but is at least to a certain extent a bit of a break from light novel guy #1000. The predominate focus of his character is his social anxiety and inability to express himself, and the idea of a make-or-break chance to re-evaluate his life, start fresh and show appreciation for those around him ties directly into these character traits- in fact, the idea of having his adult self engage with the environment he used to live in and people he used to know (ignoring the inevitable time travel issues) is actually rather clever- allowing the show to reveal characteristics of the adult Satoru (most notably through monologues) as he explores the environment along with the viewer, and then simultaneously communicating the characteristics of Satoru as a child through the way in which other characters respond to Satoru's mannerisms now that he's back in his younger body- which Satoru then picks up on and attempts to suppress, making for a dynamic that not only creates the perfect platform for non-intrusive world building and exposition as Satoru rediscovers details he would have either missed or forgotten from when he was a child, but (for lack of a better way of putting it) allows this sort of ricoshet between Satoru and other characters as we get a better look into both what he was like then and what he is like now, and how those changes in his personality effect his decisions.\\n\r\nUnfortunately, despite this interesting narrative tool, the show barely makes use of it- in fact, Satoru spends the majority of his time with characters he wasn't even acquainted with in his childhood, which seems pretty counter intuitive given the premise.\\n\\n\r\nHinazuki  lacks the standard of characterisation I'd hope to see in a female lead, but then again, she's only a kid; so there's a limit to how well explored she can be. Fortunately, the small amount of characterisation we do get for her is fairly solid with this in mind, she is introverted and self-contained as a result of her neglectful upbringing.\\n\\n\r\nThe relationship between Kayo and Satoru is confusing. At times, the show seems to want to develop her as a romantic interest in various scenes where they touch hands, go visit places and go on little dates together, but when the show addresses the fact that Satoru is actually a grown man who's demonstrating sexual and romantic interest in a child, it's simply used for comedic effect, despite having the potential to be one of the most interesting aspects of the show.\\n\\n\r\n(to the people who deny him being a paedophile, I'd encourage them to think about how, in one particular scene, he sat outside a bathroom staring at the door, listening to an 11 year old girl have a bath with his mother, gulping and blushing before shaking his head, turning away and reminding himself to \"get a grip\", totally not paedophilic.)\\n\\n\\n\r\nBut anyway, I digress- the concept of having a paedophile who isn't actually driven by their urges seems to be explored with Yuki, the teenager who is framed for the murder of the children, and is established as a paedophile. The show makes a point of making us aware of this, and yet also makes it clear that he's not a bad person, and the majority of his screen time actually portrays him as a fairly kind and compassionate person who is misunderstood by the public, and it's a shame he didn't get more screen time, because he's easily one of the better characters in the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe teacher is the character which struck me as having the most potential.\\n\r\nWhile some aspects of his character fall short, I was a big fan of the idea that he genuinely cared for Satoru, their relationship being akin to that of father and son, admittedly in a rather malformed way \"daddy and boo\", maybe.\\n\r\nOn paper it sounds a bit absurd, and while I'll admit that the way the show goes about explaining his actions isn't the best (I even said earlier that it wasn't tangible with his character), the idea itself was interesting enough to overshadow the fact that it may have not been communicated in the best way.\\n\r\nThe main reason why I feel like this idea actually works rather well is that the show, at no point, tries to ignore the fact that the teacher is screwed up, but rather explores the idea that he is simultaneously a kind person (in public) and detestable person (in private).\\n\r\nI think people naturally assume that because a character's a serial killer the way they act in public is a facade, but I feel like it's slightly more complicated than that.\\n\r\nThere's frequently stories of people who live perfectly normal, healthy lives; but unbeknownst to their family and friends, have urges to kill, urges they may even act upon at some point, so while it's admittedly contradictory, I feel like his character was written to genuinely enjoy teaching a class; if that wasn't the case, for what reason would the show even bother to address the fact that he was about to kill Satoru while he was in his coma, but decided NOT to, other than to suggest he is struggling with the side of him that wants to live a normal life and the side that wants to kill.\\n\r\nPart of me would even be inclined to say it justifies him not killing any other children in those 15 years, perhaps he IS the one who rescued Satoru from drowning, despite being the very person that drove him into the water (although the manga debunks this idea, I feel like I've started writing fanfiction here), it's far fetched, but fascinating nonetheless.\\n\r\nI won't deny that I'm completely contradicting myself here, it wasn't until I started writing the review that I started to think about the dynamic, so my thoughts on whether or not the teacher is a well written character are a bit jumbled, but honest to how I see the character nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nPizza girl who I can't remember the name of (not to be confused with pizza sauce imouto from Charlotte) comes across as a rather bland and uninspired character, and really only serves as a way of anchoring Satoru to the present day when he returns because plot.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps one of the more obvious reasons why this show got so popular in such a short space of time is just how confidently it goes about presenting itself, at no point does the show stop to question its mistakes and this is deeply rooted within the directory choices and art design, that it to say that, this show has been designed to heavily rely on its visuals to carry what is in actual fact a fairly poorly constructed narrative. From the letterboxing used in the revival scenes to imitate the rectangular format used in widescreen filming, to the visual symbolism and shot composition that, in complete contrast to what I've seen from the manga are at times fresh and completely upgrade scenes that would otherwise have little to no draw, complimenting the intended dramatic tension the anime strives for- this show clearly wants to catch the eye of the viewer with a bold and self-assured cinematic atmosphere characteristic of live-action, high budget movies.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs too, have been given a much needed upgrade, and at least from the few panels I've seen from the manga have a lot more personality to them, especially when considering this was produced by A-1 pictures, who in recent years have become notorious for having a lack of diversity with their character designs.\\n\\n\r\nIt's definitely a step in the right direction for A-1, but for every shot that spices up a scene, another comes along and provides equal mediocrity, and I can't shake the feeling that it would almost be better for the show to demonstrate none of this at all rather than occasionally show a spark of forethought.\\n\\n\r\nIgnoring that jarring sound effect that blasts your ears every time Satoru activates his \"revival\" or a fucking butterfly flies across the screen, the sound direction is sharp and consistent- the opening is orgasmic, it's been too long since we've had an Asian Kung-Fu Generation song in an anime, and similarly, the ending song is of high quality- being one of only the two songs performed by \"Sayuri\" for an anime (the first being for Ranpo Kitan).\\n\\n\r\nThe OST, by Yuki Kajiura, pulls from the same bag as her usual catalogue of stuff- serviceable to decent.\\n\r\nThe voice acting is fairly standard, with the exception of Kayo Hinazuki, voiced by Yuuki Aoi- who did a stellar job with the role of a kuudere, and Shinnosuke Mitsushima with his first role ever in an anime as Satoru, who's voice acting was so natural that at times it almost felt out of place next to the some of the more average performances, which felt pretty rigid when held up against his.\\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't call Erased terrible, in fact, I can completely understand why it garnered the attention it did. It's thrilling, ambitious and easy to get invested in for some- with a cinematic presentation that turns a passable concept into something that, for better or for worse, stands out from the crowd, but beneath all of these elements is a show that fails at the fundamentals, which crumbles from the ground up and tries to hide these issues by ignoring them completely, and no amount of visual polish can change that.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+Some great voice acting\\n\r\n+Cinematic visuals/directing\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Never make the butler the killer (or in this case the teacher)\\n\r\n-Time travel power that serves as a cheap plot device\\n\r\n-Seriously how the fuck does this power work\\n\r\n-Doesn't always fully take advantage on some of its more interesting ideas\\n\r\n-Ignores the killer's indiscriminate nature for the sake of wrapping things up in a neat little bow\\n\r\n-Poorly handles the theme of abuse, no commentary whatsoever\\n\r\n-Pizza girl's dad had his life fucked up because he stole a chocolate bar, pretty ironic given the ridiculous shit the killer gets away with.\\n\r\n-Ends with implying Satoru's manga is inspired by the events of the show, the editor remarking that it's going to be a huge success.\\n\r\nSomething about that seems a little too self indulgent/vain.\\n\r\n-The tsundere loli didn't get enough screen time.",

            "content": "**SPOILER FREE REVIEW**\r\nErased is a grippingly cinematic, but ultimately childish and half-baked attempt at an anime mystery drama that makes a mockery out of the serious themes it chooses to incorporate. However, that didn\u2019t seem to stop it from taking the anime world by storm and soaring into the top FIVE on the all time MAL rankings while it was still airing. Yikes. This show is clumsy, saturated in over-convenience, and excruciatingly awkward at times, but it\u2019s obvious that something about Erased really resonated with a lot of people. Let\u2019s find exactly what makes this show popular and, more importantly, where it all went wrong.\r\nSynopsis:Satoru Fujinuma, our protagonist, is a detached 29 year old Manga artist who possesses a special ability that he refers to as \u201cRevival\u201d, which causes him to be sent back in time several minutes before tragic accidents that occur in his general vicinity, whether he wants to or not. He will continue to be sent back in time until he stops the event in question from occurring. One day, tragedy strikes, but this time, Satoru is sent 18 whole years in the past. Soon, he realizes that the event he has to prevent is the abduction and killing of one of his classmates, the solitary and mysterious Kayo Hinazuki, which took place when he was a child. \\n\\n\r\nIf you couldn\u2019t tell right of the bat after reading the synopsis, Erased was playing with fire from the very beginning. The use of time resets as a plot device carries great power in the context of a story, and with great power comes great responsibility. The problem with time resets is that if you don\u2019t establish strict and appropriate rules and restrictions from the very beginning, it becomes nothing more than a transparently lazy deus ex machina whose properties bend and shape to the convenience of the plot. Nothing breaks immersion like some mystical superpower with no established boundaries that seamlessly drifts in and out of the plot for no discernible reason, only reappearing to solve otherwise unsolvable problems. This is a problem that Erased has, and it\u2019s one of the main things that make the story so impossible to take seriously. Satoru\u2019s \u201cRevival\u201d ability has absolutely no rules. It shows up for no logical reason, doesn\u2019t show up in situations where it did before, contradicts the very short and insufficient explanation we were given of it, and the story can\u2019t seem to decide if he has the ability to consciously trigger it or if he does not. It\u2019s madness. Utter chaos. The foundation of this anime\u2019s premise was so badly botched that it causes the world of Erased to come off as one that doesn\u2019t have any rules, and that is far and away its biggest failure as a mystery drama. I don\u2019t mean to suggest that Revival is the only aspect of this show that is overly convenient and lazy though; the anime is riddled with poor planning and lack of explanation. For example, people show up for no reason and out of nowhere at the best/worst possible moment on a consistent basis, like this is some sort of battle shounen. Erased\u2019s writing is a disaster, plain and simple.\\n\\n\r\nI could talk for a long time about the technical problems of Erased\u2019s storyline, but it commits a sin that is perhaps even more egregious: The bastardization of a mature theme. Namely, child abuse. If you are going to incorporate such a serious and heart-wrenching topic into your story, fine; just make sure that you treat it with the respect that it deserves. Unfortunately, Erased utterly fails to do that. Instead, it merely shoehorns it in as a cheap, lowest-common-denominator way of tugging at our heartstrings. Erased chooses to make us feel bad for its characters not by fleshing them out with personality, but by having them be graphically beaten on camera for reasons that are completely unnecessary to the plot. This edgy, shock-factor bullshit is what cemented my dislike of this show. This is the kind of thing that doesn\u2019t just impede my enjoyment of the anime, but makes me genuinely angry that the writers thought they could manipulate the emotions of the viewers so underhandedly. It\u2019s completely shameless, and they should be embarrassed.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s one more aspect of this show\u2019s plot that I can\u2019t resist mentioning... *Sigh\u2026  Hear me out on this one. Maybe this is just me, but the entire premise of this show is fucking CREEPY. Seriously. There are some shockingly blatant pedophilic undertones in Erased. There are multiple instances where the protagonist, WHO IS 29 YEARS OLD, gets obviously aroused by the thought of a relationship (or more\u2026) with Hinazuki, who is a child. If you think I\u2019m joking, there is scene in the latter half of the show where Hinazuki is taking a bath and Satoru overhears her from the other room. He then gets a flustered/uncomfortable, flushed look on his face and thinks to himself, and I quote, \u201cGet a hold of yourself. You\u2019re 29.\u201d WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT SHIT MAN???  That\u2019s not a one-time thing either! That is a reoccurring gag throughout the show! Who the HELL thought that would be a good idea?! Is this some sort of underground fetish show or something? Was it made for people who fantasize about fucking children while they are also in the body of a child? Nobody is ever going to convince me that Satoru\u2019s reoccurring and vague attraction to Hinazuki is not disturbing as hell. It makes my skin crawl, and more importantly, it makes the show even more impossible to take seriously. This is incorporating humor into your show GONE WRONG.\\n\\n\r\nAs bad as Erased\u2019s plot is, even shows with bad plots can often be redeemed if they have a strong cast of characters. Well, Erased doesn\u2019t have that. Not even close, in fact. Our protagonist, Satoru, is your standard white-knight archetype. If you don\u2019t know what that is, it\u2019s when a character is defined entirely by his desire to be morally righteous and help others. There is literally no other defining trait to this character whatsoever! The first episode makes it seem like they would make him deadpan or detached or, hell, SOMETHING in order to differentiate him, but no. Any individuality Satoru may have possessed in the first episode completely evaporates and is nowhere to be found from episode 2 and onwards. He\u2019s just a walking, talking robot who spurns the plot forward with his soulless, mechanically predictable actions. At no point, except maybe in the first episode, did I care about this character, and that is a certain way for a show to fail.\\n\\n\r\nNow let\u2019s talk about Satoru\u2019s love interest (Yes, I\u2019m calling her that. This show knows what it did), Kayo Hinazuki. Kayo is a character that is able to single-handedly exemplify so much of what is wrong with this show, in the sense that she is not a real character at all; she is a plot device, just like the rest of the cast. Her sole purpose is to be used as a literal whipping post just so that justice-kun can swoop in to be her knight in shining armor and pretend he doesn\u2019t want to get into those prepubescent pants. She is nothing more than an object the show utilizes to manipulate the emotions of the viewers; an artificially created victim who exists only to suffer some one-dimensional, interchangeable hardship rather than an actual character with a personality and interesting outlooks, dreams, or crises.  Erased is lazy, deceiving character writing at its finest.\\n\\n\r\nSo at this point, if you haven\u2019t watched Erased, you may be wondering that if everything I wrote in the above paragraphs is true, what is the appeal of this show? The answer, quite simply, is that the cinematography is very well executed and the directing is very engaging. The environments are always crisp and detailed, plus the shot composition is absolutely spot-on in most instances. There are notable exceptions, but I won\u2019t get into that. As for the directing, Erased presents information to the viewer in a very streamlined, matter of fact manner. Scenes intended to be connected are always spelled out to the viewer through the use of flashbacks, and lots of creative transition sequences are used with narrative accompaniment between scenes. I prefer when shows leave it up to the viewer to deduce certain things rather than being spoon-fed, but for what they were going for, they did a good job. Erased looks good, is animated dramatically, and is easy to digest. Those are the factors that lead to its massive popularity, and frankly, those are the only aspects of the show that can\u2019t be harshly criticized justifiably. \\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, Erased is just another overhyped anime written for edgy teens that uses cheap, manipulative tactics to emotionally affect the audience, fooling them into thinking it\u2019s a well-written show when it obviously isn\u2019t. It\u2019s immature, terribly inconsistent, the characters are soulless plot devices, and its laughable use of the ultimate anime clich\u00e9 \u201ctime resets\u201d is just the icing on the cake. Erased is a bad show with good animation, and sometimes, that\u2019s all a show needs to get popular.",

            "content": "Hype can be a fickle thing when it comes to seasonal anime. At first it allows fans to get excited and anxious for the next episode, but majority of the time it ends up with many feeling somewhat disappointed with what they had been watching. This can be attributed to the fact that only one episode is released per week, and this week-long wait between episodes is a breeding ground for die-hard fans to praise a show as one of the best anime after only having seen a couple episodes. You only have to see the \u2018Top Anime List\u2019 on MAL to see that wheneveryou\u2019re reading this, there\u2019s probably at least one show currently airing that snuck its way onto the list, only to slowly drop off once hype dies down and reality sets in. At one point I was a victim of this mentality, but now after experiencing disappointment as a result, I see hyping up a show like this as asinine, often leading to impairments in judgement. Erased, a Winter 2016 anime produced by A1 Pictures is one of the best examples of this: before the halfway point of its runtime, Erased had managed to capture the #4 spot on MAL\u2019s Top Anime List, a feat I have never seen any other weekly seasonal anime do. And as I am writing this it isn\u2019t even in the Top 50 anymore, with many of its top reviews being negative; truly a fall from grace. So, looking back at show over a year since it ended, here are my thoughts on Erased:\\n\\n\r\n*EDIT: SPOILERS ABOUND, BEWARE IF YOU LIVE UNDER A ROCK AND SOMEHOW HAVE NOT WATCHED THE SHOW YET*\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Erased follows Satoru Fujinuma, a struggling manga artist in his twenties living a rather dour life, having to work a pizza delivery day job to make ends meet. However, Satoru has a supernatural ability called \u2018Revival\u2019 that causes him to travel back through his own time, usually only by a couple minutes, allowing him to stop any accidents or disasters nearby. The catch is that Satoru\u2019s time-travel ability works out of his control, being the setup for the premise of Erased. By the end of the first episode Satoru finds his mother murdered at his house, and is quickly framed as the prime suspect. This chain of events causes Revival to activate, sending Satoru 18 years into the past and back to his 10-year-old child self. Seeing this as a sign, Satoru uses this opportunity to prevent the abduction and murder of three young students at the hands of a serial killer, starting with the first victim, Kayo Hinazuki. The premise alone is nothing special and somewhat contrived from the start, but the way it is presented through great visual direction along with setting up an important mystery element in the murderer/serial killer leaves viewers eager to see how things will unfold.\\n\\n\r\nEpisodes 2-4 are what I consider to be the highlight of the entire show. It\u2019s in these episodes where we see Satoru attempt to save Kayo\u2019s fate through befriending her when no one else would. Kayo is cold towards everyone due to domestic abuse from her mother and her overall troubled life at home, so it\u2019s no surprise that she does not care about Satoru\u2019s attempts at friendship initially, but Satoru remains committed and continues to pursue her. The process takes some time but she slowly opens up to Satoru and sees him more like a real friend as time goes on. The 4th episode also leaves us with a cliff-hanger regarding Kayo\u2019s safety; was Satoru successful in stopping Kayo\u2019s fate? Or was all his effort still not enough to change the past? The character interactions, atmosphere and overall direction all worked well here, drawing more viewers into the world, the relationship between the two leads and Satoru\u2019s goal. The supporting characters also get some shine on screen, with Satoru\u2019s mother Sachiko and his teacher Gaku slowly getting more involved in the main plotline, as well as his friend Kenya who seemed to know more about the story than what a boy his age should have. Characters still need more development, questions still need answering and they could use some more exploration overall but from the great setup so far, it\u2019s not surprising that fans were excited for the series and what would happen next. Sadly, this was the highlight of the show, meaning what would happen next would be when the series starts to fall.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s revealed in episode 5 that Kayo did in fact go missing, and Satoru having failed to change the past is brought back to his own time, still under suspicion of Sachiko\u2019s murder and goes into hiding. He encounters Aira, his co-worker who believes him to be innocent and allows him to stay at her place. Aira was on screen with Satoru before the time-skip, even admiring him after seeing him save a child from being hit by a truck, but it\u2019s here where her overall character is explored and, unfortunately, there\u2019s not much to go into. Airi and Satoru have a conversation about how she can trust him and she reveals how her parents divorced over the theft of a chocolate bar, this being one of the dumber explanations in the show overall. Regardless, from using that awful example she states how she has conflicting thoughts when it comes to believing in people and their motives. This could have been an interesting concept if explored into, but that never happens, and that seems to be a common nuance I have with the show overall. It has these interesting concepts and elements that could have the series more interesting and deep, but they all end up being undeveloped, underwhelming and a waste of potential.\\n\\n\r\nThe writing only gets worse from here. Satoru activates Revival through sheer willpower and reverts back to his child form soon after he is found and arrested by police, and with this second chance he intends to do everything he can to stop Kayo from being kidnapped. His actions go so far as to \u2018abduct\u2019 her himself and attempting to murder her mother. Both of these actions are pretty ridiculous, especially when you consider that it\u2019s a 29 year old man that\u2019s doing this, not a child. Eventually he returns her to her mother, who reacts violently towards Satoru and Sachiko, going so far as to try and kill Sachiko with a shovel. Now it is obvious that Kayo\u2019s mother is a loon that needs more than just counselling, but I find it annoying how she was previously shown to have gone through all the trouble of making sure her abuse wasn\u2019t noticeable, given that she was shown to have almost struck her daughter while in the company of other people. Through poor writing as the plot progressed, she proved to only be a one-dimensional villain; a mere caricature that ultimately holds no merits. Unfortunately, she\u2019s not the only one who turns out like this.\\n\\n\r\nIt is at this point where I see the story start to turn into shambles. Because of her mother\u2019s actions, Kayo moves away to live with her grandmother and away from Satoru, and with that subplot finished, Satoru begins on working to save the lives of the other two abductees. So far the show was loved by many at this point because of the progression of Satoru and Kayo\u2019s relationship and their individual development; Kayo learning to open up to others and Satoru never giving up on others. It was a cute friendship with hints of romance that swooned the anime community with its cute charm and visual guise. So when one half had left the show, it made many viewers feel like their investment had been somewhat wasted, myself included. However, there are more problems that stem from this change of focus, mainly in regards to the characters. The other two victims are Hiromi Sugita, one of his classmates, and Aya Nakanishi, a student from a neighbouring school and viewers learn next to nothing about either character. While Kayo was never the pinnacle of character development by any means, she mattered so much more to the overarching plot than Hiromi and Aya. It is so obvious that they are nothing more than replaceable characters to make Satoru look more heroic and likeable. Other supporting characters are also left lacklustre, with much of their rationale turning out to be, ironically, irrational. Kenya, one of Satoru\u2019s classmates, is perhaps the biggest example of this, seeming to be a character that was far more intelligent than he initially led on. But he just ended up getting shafted by poor writing, like most of the other characters in the show. The best character by far is Sachiko, and the reason why is because all of her actions are completely logical as well as the fact that beyond episode 1, she is never really explored, thus never even having the chance to get screwed up unlike everyone else. \\n\\n\r\nBut there is one character that stands out from the rest by just how awful he was utilized, and that is the real culprit; the man that abducted Kayo 18 years ago, and in present-time killed Sachiko. That man was revealed to be none other than Gaku Yashiro, Satoru\u2019s homeroom teacher. This revelation is made in episode 10 to Satoru minutes before his apparent death by being trapped in a frozen lake. This moment had any sense of shock or suspense completely absent because no one who watched this show was even surprised! The killer\u2019s identity is so obvious that it destroys any element of mystery \u2013 which it was initially marketed as \u2013 and does not help the show in any possible way. It only takes a couple episodes to figure out who the killer is with the blatant foreshadowing, and even if by some chance you don\u2019t realise it then, it\u2019s simple process of elimination. Just ask yourself \u201cWhich characters look like the killer?\u201d and there\u2019s probably only one person that comes up.  Another issue I have with the character is how he is presented as a mastermind for half the show, seemingly omnipresent and always throwing the blame to someone else. But towards the end, he turns into this incompetent idiot so drastically that it\u2019s laughable. Gaku being caught as the killer is also incredibly stupid to the point where you legitimately cannot take the series seriously anymore. It\u2019s as if his entire development jumped off a building ala Satoru in the last episode. Terrible\\n\\n\r\nMatter of fact, the entire ending is terrible and leaves a sour taste in the mouths of even the most die-hard fans. From the lead up with Satoru being in a coma for 15 years, to the final moment where Satoru and Airi meet again, it is all so contrived and full of plot holes that makes me wonder just what the original writer was thinking. Satoru becoming a successful manga artist afterwards because he \u2018found himself\u2019? I call bullshit! It left so many questions unanswered and decided to go for a \u201chappy ending\u201d than anything realistic, sacrificing what was left of any good writing and revealing its true colours as a show that at its core, was just emotionally manipulative. Its comparable to a slap in the face to those who wanted to know more about the world and the people in it, but perhaps the biggest problem I had most of all was how it completely ditched the concept of Revival.\\n\\n\r\nThe very first thing that intrigued me about this show was the Revival ability. While I did care about other features of the show later on, I was always thinking about the concept of it and how it could be explained. Time travel is in no way a new concept when it comes to anime, and the notion for it in this case seemed to just be a simple plot device to move the narrative along, but with time, effort and proper focus, could have developed into something more substantial. But as the show went on, the potential for this slowly dwindled down to false hope. At first, Revival only activates when an accident happens nearby, but on the fourth reset he was able to trigger it by yelling \u201cGo Back!\u201d with no accidents nearby him (of course, this had to happen the minute after the police had found him). And then they have the audacity to say Revival no longer activates once the real culprit is caught. What was even the point? The time resets were only used when it was convenient with all kinds of ways to trigger them, losing any sense of consistency by the end. \\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the visuals, Erased is consistently good with some breakout scenes here and there. The animation was done by A1 Pictures, a studio well known for their shows having a similar art style and while I can see many similarities to shows like Sword Art Online and GATE, Erased\u2019s style feels more refined and unique. This is probably due to how the show tries to go for a more cinematic look; the animation techniques used really helped to intensify the plot and overall atmosphere. It has the kind of visual look similar to that of Mamoru Hosoda films, a kind of spectacle uncommon among the medium. The way Erased was also able to present character emotions, specifically Satoru\u2019s internal conflict is certainly commendable; the kind of detail that is rarely seen in anime. However I do think the overall animation is somewhat overrated when it comes to symbolism. Both their handling and utilization of \u2018red is dead\u2019 and spider threads are rather poor, adding nothing to the actual narrative. When these literary devices are dumbed down so much, it should not be praised. Spoon feeding symbolism to viewers like they are all children is just lazy.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully, Erased does manage to excel when it comes to its music. The soundtrack was composed by Yuki Kajiura, known for her great work on the music from Sword Art Online and Fate/Zero, but here her work feels somewhat unimpressive. Many of the tracks complement the variety of scenes they are in, but overall are fairly typical and generic, with one OST in particularly \u2013 Only I Am Missing \u2013 sounding more like a classic Ghibli track than otherwise. The OP and ED however, were definite standouts, with Re:Re being an upbeat catchy opening that was never skipped and the ending fitting the mellow undertones quite well. Both were well crafted and made the experience more enjoyable. The English dub overall was well done, with extra compliments for having Satoru sound the least anime-like of all the characters; a rare yet wise decision from the director. Not only was this choice helpful in making the story feel more special, but also helped make Satoru a more likeable and relatable protagonist. The sound effects were the most admirable part of the entire show, as throughout all 12 episodes it has some of the most technically proficient use of basic sound that A1 Pictures has ever produced: from the footsteps in the snow to the whistling wind. These little things made the most impact in my opinion as it further immersed myself into the story and overall experience.\\n\\n\r\nAnd thus, these are my thoughts on Erased. It set the standard quite high in the beginning, but this turned out to do more harm than good in the long run. I would still recommend the show as it is an enjoyable watch and tells a heart-warming tale of a man trying to save those he lost in the past. But that in no way correlates to a good show. For every aspect about how visually stunning the show is, lies a handful of issues and problems in the writing. And when it slowly exposed these flaws it was as if the show was a snowball rolling down a hill, gradually picking up more plot holes and contrivances overall. But when it hits the ground, it breaks apart under its own weight, leaving hunks of snow in its place. Children still play with what is left, until it slowly vanishes and disappears from the ground. They\u2019re all sad the snow has left but only for a short time, as they all see right on the horizon another snowball starting to make its way down the hill. And just in time for the next season too.\\n",

            "content": "Boku dake ga Inai Machi (ERASED) is an anime that capitalizes on emotional appeal. It incorporates plot devices that primarily targets the audience\u2019s pathos and on a surface level achieves this very effectively. Unfortunately, these same plot devices are only contrived for the sole purpose of making the audience have the so-called \u201cfeels.\u201d From a more logical perspective, they do not make any sense, and because of this, we are left with an inconsistent plotline that is riddled with flaws.\r\n(Side note: minor spoilers from this point on.)\r\nAs one example, consider how Kayo was abused by her mother. Although I am sure the author meant toincorporate some level of realism into his writing, Kayo\u2019s abuse was ultimately used as a way to draw the audience on an emotional basis. Since society frowns down upon all forms of child abuse, most people would accept it at face value and never question it. But let\u2019s be honest for a second: none of it was explained. Why was the abuse occurring? Were there any specific triggers? Why didn\u2019t anyone notice this if this has been happening for years? And so on.\\n\\n\r\nPlus, was it really necessary to use child abuse like this? There are so many other ways that you could have elicited just as powerful of an emotional response and NOT use something controversial. Being heartbroken, amending broken friendships, taking a stand with your friends, etc. (all of which could have been implemented in the context of this show, by the way) could have just as easily done the trick.\\n\\n\r\nNow aside from the emotional appeal, the rest of the plot doesn\u2019t make any sense either. For something that is so fundamental to the plot, there is no explanation as to how Satoru gained the Revival ability other than the fact that he somehow magically has it. In a world that is governed by the natural laws of this universe, the Revival ability hardly seems remotely realistic and, as a result, it seems to serve no real purpose other than to force the plot along. On top of all of that, the Satoru\u2019s Revival ability seemingly has no rules to it other than Satoru\u2019s free will. Need to use it because you really don\u2019t want to go to jail? No problem, Revival time! Don\u2019t need Revival ever again because you said so? Okay adios, now it\u2019s gone. Forever. Because of reasons.\\n\\n\r\nAs for pacing, it spans the entire spectrum: fast, slow, just right \u2013 it\u2019s all there. Sometimes the show pulls it off just dandy. The first episode, for example, was crazy fast, but it still eked out the main gist of what was going on: Satoru\u2019s weird mysterious power, the main characters, and so on. On the other hand, the last three episodes were fast too, but they were all crammed in a way that resulted in unsubstantial character development (e.g. Hiromi and Aya) even though it was clear from the first episode that the two of them played a significant role in the entire plot. Furthermore, all of this cramming eventually leads to important parts in the manga being left out \u2013 so, manga readers, beware!\\n\\n\r\nNow onto the characters. Sure, Satoru is collected and analytical, but his personality is incredibly dry. A lot of the other characters did not stand out that much either, minus maybe the smart, attentive Kenya. But what I found most remarkable about the characters was that some of them shared deep, meaningful relationships. For example: Satoru and his mom, Sachiko. A true motherly figure, Sachiko not only takes care of Satoru but also his friends. She knows how he thinks and operates on a day-to-day basis. She knows when not to pry into her son\u2019s life, and she respects him for who he is as a person. All of this is reflected in the short yet interesting dialogues between her and Satoru.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, some other relationships end up not being as strong as Satoru\u2019s and Sachiko\u2019s. Satoru and Kayo is one example of this. The middle 6 or 7 episodes were intentionally slowed down in terms of pacing so that the two of them could build their relationship from out of thin air to something deep. And for the most part, the show accomplishes this well. But in the last three episodes of the show, the show takes a complete U-turn, tossing out their entire relationship out the window. Now before you accuse me for being super butthurt or laughing at me because their \u201cship\u201d sank, let me be clear: I would have no problem with this if this were executed well, but let\u2019s break down what happens. To start off, Satoru\u2019s been there for Kayo from the very beginning, so it really does not make sense how she would turn her back on him after Satoru reawakens. Sure, maybe the other-guy-in-the-picture had gotten to know Kayo when Satoru wasn\u2019t physically around, but there was nothing in the anime that suggested such a thing. Just a minute of explanation and leaving things at the status quo wouldn\u2019t be an issue. Satoru and Airi is another example, since the anime leaves out a huge chunk of their relationship in its adaptation.\\n\\n\r\nMoving away from the characters and now onto the sound and the art. The artwork is animated by A-1 Pictures. They\u2019ve also animated Shigatsu, AnoHana, SAO, and the whole spiel so it is done well. Sound is also great. The music was timed well to create an ominous mood when it was needed. Voice acting was decent too, although none of it was that exceptional.\\n\\n\r\nIn the grand scheme of things, ERASED is a watchable show and I wouldn\u2019t mind recommending this to others. Emotional appeal isn\u2019t inherently bad. Think about Clannad After Story, Little Busters! Refrain, and others \u2013 they all had their charm, and ERASED is just another show that falls into that category. However, basing an entire plot primarily on emotional appeal \u2013 that\u2019s when things start to fall apart and become incomprehensible and illogical. That\u2019s why ERASED isn\u2019t a masterpiece \u2013 but it\u2019s not downright horrible either. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: C+\\n\\n\r\nAuthor's Disclaimer: Please remember, this is my own personal opinion. I critique anime primarily on how the story is executed and how well-rounded the characters are. This review is not meant to target any other review but was intended to provide a more holistic analysis.\\n\\n\r\nIt should also be noted that this is a full-fledged review of the entire season.\\n",

            "content": "Ambition is the elixir of creation. It is that which gives spirit to its container, and those rare gems that rise above their standardized, rehashed counterparts are almost always backed by the unadulterated ambition of their creator(s). And ambition rests on the shoulders of ideas. The notion of ideas and ambition being interlocked is an unspoken truth - a virtuous tenet of great works. However, there is something more; something that too often gets overlooked, and when untended, sets both ambition and the idea that bore it on route for inevitable disaster. That \u2018something\u2019 is focus. An idea \u2013 no matter how great or innovativeit is \u2013 even if backed by a cosmic-scaled ambition will remain infantile if it has no tangible focus to drive it. The focus conundrum is one that plagues creators alike no matter how big their starry ideas are or juiced up their spirit is, the end-result will remain a disappointment and one that\u2019s far greater than those that are destined for mediocrity or lower from the get-go. \\n\\n\r\nThis focus- malady was essentially what broke one of the most promised shows of the 2015 winter season. Boku dake ga Inai Machi or Erased, even with its high points and a decent number of redeeming factors could not be fully salvaged as a whole, for its ambitions were high and ideas notable, but it lacked a solid backbone to support it - leaving it to bear its half-hearted promises openly for all.\\n\\n\r\nAdapted from the manga by Sanbe Kei, Erased revolves around a 29-year old Satoru Fujinuma \u2013 an unsuccessful mangaka \u2013 who has a supernatural ability that allows him to revert time to prevent ill-fated disasters. The plot of Erased however is triggered by the murder of someone close to Satoru for which he becomes the suspect for. In order to resolve this mystery, his \u201cability\u201d sends him back to when he was a grade-school student where he discovers that the murders of his present could be connected to crimes that occurred in his past, specifically the abduction and murder of his classmate Hinazuki Kayo. This revelation sets off the causal pendulum of Erased. \\n\\n\r\nOne thing that should be immediately obvious is that the premise isn\u2019t groundbreaking. The reason why this is important is because it seems like many \u201ccriticisms\u201d floating around are obsessed with the notion of ridiculing this show but couldn\u2019t find a reason beyond \u201cwow this is really unoriginal\u201d. Unoriginality has become one of the most use-when-convenient forms of criticism that it becomes almost a detractor for anyone using it as such, since it signifies nothing. There is no working definition of originality anymore and the free-for-all, nebulous meaning which people assign nowadays bears absolutely no value to the reader nor does it add any particular insight. Saying something is unoriginal is not a stand-alone in-of-it-self argument, just like arguing something is good because it is/was well-executed. Just because \u201ctime-travel\u201d has been employed by numerous works in the past does not mean every work to adopt it in the present of future will or should be instantly written off because of complaints of imitation. What matters is how the individual work molds its premise, constructs it within the bounds of its narrative, and resolves them. It\u2019s the technicalities, the nuances, the hows and whys, the internal mechanics that fuel the progression that will validate the premise, not sketchy, ambiguous buzz terminology. \\n\\n\r\nIn the case of Erased, its premise is nothing glamorous, but the way the plot points were built: through visual direction, atmospheric intensity, and having a tight grasp on consequential progression made it worth investing in \u2013 at least initially. This was crucial to the essence of the series considering that its foundational appeal was that of a psychological thriller/mystery. Regardless of the tonal transformation and genre shifts that occur later where the series opts to rely more on drama tactics, incorporating slice of life elements, and some traces of romance, its base appeal came from the mystery and the psychological turmoil it exposed of its characters and their circumstances. The mystery element was always supposed to be at the forefront and there was nothing subtle about that. For the first three episodes, Erased keeps a strong-hold on its world \u2013 revealing necessary information and characters, whispering secrets to the audiences, invoking an uncomfortable environment, and keeping the momentum high with each episode\u2019s conclusion. Not only did it manage to stimulate audience imagination but it continuously teased one\u2019s curiosity (even if the mystery itself wasn\u2019t that complicated or hard to figure out). That in itself is rather commendable since it implies that in such a short time/frame the work was able to create an atmosphere that transcended its intended appeal. This is probably the core reason why the show was able beguile its viewer so imminently and intensely.  \\n\\n\r\nYet, the atmospheric grandness that tempted the curiosity of its viewers wasn\u2019t enough. It did well enough to create that illusion and avoid giving \u201cgood\u201d answers for a while, but eventually the mask it adorned started to crack, and the hollowness of what was inside began to permeate the stage.  At some crossroad, the once-focused direction of the series morphed into a jarring vision-less drama. The fundamental problem with Erased wasn\u2019t bad characters or thematic inconsistency but something far more basic than that. It lacked focus, completely. What began as a finely focused show morphed into a hodge-podge of splattered ideas that went everywhere except where they needed to. Inconsistencies began to appear, plot devices began to appear, character absurdity began to appear, and things that didn\u2019t matter began to matter, because that\u2019s the result of a complete loss of focus. This amplified almost every flaw of the show, which might have not been a flaw prior, but with the sudden loss of vision, they became a very tangible reality.\\n\\n\r\nThis lack of focus led to the ultimate downfall of the series. Due to the show not knowing what it was doing, the audience didn\u2019t know how to digest what\u2019s being presented and this led to many misguided problems. For example, being unfocused caused many of the character problems that appeared, especially regarding the nature of Satoru\u2019s relationship with Kayo. Another flaw that surfaced was the pacing. The constant regurgitation of emphasizing about how much Satoru cares (by resetting over and over) turned a potential point of good character exploration into a feels-y gimmick. This fared to be quite devastating, since the show had very little time to spend on other characters, motivations, and the resolution which ultimately made some of those aspects feel incomplete and lackluster. Even some of the visual strengths became glaringly flawed. The heavy-handed use of color, shadowing, transitioning that all literally added to the narrative now appeared to be chicanery, because the focus that once drove those things existed no more.\\n\\n\r\nThough it must be noted, Erased has a lot of problems but many of the flaws that have been repeatedly argued are so over-exaggerated and a product of nit-picking that I feel almost compelled to address them, and by extension, offer some defense. For one example, the claim that the series has bad characters because some of them are one-dimensional is absurd. There is something called foil characters, or static characters that exist for the sole purpose to add dimension and value to primary characters (and their overall development). This is specifically in regards to Kayo\u2019s mother and other characters that had very specific functions. A work having a cast involving some static characters does not equate to bad characters altogether. Though, this does not negate the actual instances of weak character exploration and contrivances in the show which was definitely a problem, but that alone does not stand as a valid critique of overall bad characterization.  \\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, the claim that Erased was thematically impotent because it didn\u2019t do anything grand with its depiction of \u201cchild abuse\u201d is really just baffling. Why should it? The show paraded as many different things, but one thing it never claimed was the title of some deep and meaningful commentary nor was child abuse a theme of the show, rather it was more a catalyst. It\u2019s completely acceptable for a work to create a backstory of a character in any way it desires as long as it adds to the narrative, and the abuse was crucial to the first timeline. It wasn\u2019t added to make some grand sentiment about the subject itself. It actually made way for character exploration and interaction, and some of the themes of hope, change, camaraderie that the show tries to instill. Of course, whether those themes were meaningful in the larger context of things is questionable.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, the  flak it received for the supernatural aspect is also bizarre. The ability that Satoru had was something that had to be assumed on the part of the viewer and the world of Erased. Of course it can be argued that it\u2019s a convenient plot device, but it seems to be a pointless endeavor. To illustrate, when watching horror films, does the need to question the existence of ghosts or demons ever deter from the film\u2019s actual value? It is an assumed trait of the plot, the world, and the premise of the work and there is nothing inherently wrong with adopting a supernatural plot point, given that the world supports it. In Satoru\u2019s case, it was briefly explained within the context of the story\u2019s ambition. It isn\u2019t utilized from a sci-fi perspective where there needs to pages of subtext and exposition explaining why and how the mechanics of this ability work for the story to have meaning or merit. The problem arises when the ability or element is used as a cop-out or for petty outs over proper conclusions, but that lies on the plot holes caused by the ability, not the ability itself or the lack of explanation surrounding it. In scope of that, there could have been more substance behind it, which might have helped the show\u2019s fundamental problem of focus, but it isn\u2019t a point that drives this show into the gutter that many have placed it in solely due to this ability existing without a manual explaining it. \\n\\n\r\nRegardless of its post-hubris problems and its anticlimactic descent, there were some components of Erased that remained impeccable and worth experiencing. The visual and sound aspects of the show were really a treat. For the most part, they created the exact kind of feeling necessary for impact. The mood that Erased was able to consistently supply and maintain was nothing short of a feat. It kept its melancholic roots steadily into the ground and its eerie nature steadily at the forefront, even if some of it was in vain; it was still emotive and compelling. \\n\\n\r\n It was absolutely successful in its ability to deliver what all good thrillers should: tension. I cannot stress how amazingly this series constructed build-ups and as consequence, a chilling tension that seeped through the screen.This was perfectly captured throughout the show. And even though the mystery itself seemed pretty simplistic, the tension and atmosphere created by the series never allowed the viewer to turn back. It stuck to basic ingredients and partly delivered on that with great fervor. Additionally, even if the overarching focus was lost, some of the moments in the show were extremely well-done and dramatized in a way that were quite evocative. These interactions helped weave the thematic fabric of the show while also refining the characters in the process, in a fairly meaningful way. This was pure magic created by how well the atmosphere was able to drive the dynamics of the series from its plot choices to its character imperatives.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Erased was a solidly entertaining show that had a good deal to offer, and I enjoyed the ride - as haphazard and bumpy it was. Though I still can't help feel - even with its redeeming points -the biting disappointment that continues to linger through over lost potential and misdirection. Even with its spirited ambition, and interesting ideas, the lack of focus kept it from becoming a work of stature, and left it ingrained as nothing more than bittersweet memory that unfortunately cannot be reverted.\\n",

            "content": "It was a cold, uncompromising winter in the early weeks of 2016 but thankfully a new anime had heralded its arrival with a promise warm the world\u2019s hearts. People braved the blizzard of mediocrity to find that one show that could rise to the top and be the ray of sunshine they craved. Boku dake ga Inai Machi (Or known by its English title \u2018Erased\u2019) waved its hand high and proud, promising a touching tale of one man\u2019s journey to fix both the past and the present. The show did indeed have a certain glow about it that appealed to me but it\u2019s sad tosay that it died out into a whimper by the time the curtains had closed.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s unsurprising to see the initial widespread interest Erased generated because it had a list of ingredients that when put together could create something special. Time travel? Murder? Mystery? I strapped myself in for what I expected to be a tense experience that would leave me searching for answers. But as anyone would know, you could have a list of the finest ingredients available and in the hands of an incompetent chef it would turn into a disaster. Erased delivers what is an underwhelming execution to a setting that promised more. I was left bitterly disappointed by the show\u2019s conveniences placed into the script and its underwhelming reveals. Despite some memorable scenes, Erased has left little impact on me.\\n\\n\r\nWe follow Satoru Fujinuma (Voiced by anime debutants Shinnosuke Mitsushima and Tao Tsuchiya), a 29-year-old manga artist with an ability to go back in time several minutes before some form of tragedy strikes. His ability, which he titles \u2018revival\u2019, gives him a chance to change events to prevent any disaster from happening. When one of the most horrifying incidents imaginable befalls him, his ability kicks in. This time however it\u2019s not just minutes but years that Satoru gets sent back. Working with his old school classmates he tries his best to catch a criminal and change the future \u2013 or the present he just arrived from depending how you look at it. Realising the significance of the time period he\u2019s found himself in, Satoru starts to dig around for the solution to not just change one but several lives for the better.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening episode of Erased was one that left me asking questions \u2013 but in a good way. It had easily done enough to get me make me care about what the end result could be. It screamed one thing above all: Potential. There was one big problem that began to develop however and that was the anime betrayed my expectations that it had helped me to establish early on in the piece. Following its presentation of suspects and the crimes in 1988 that took place I was led to believe that we would be dealing with a mystery. Everything in the first couple of episodes pointed the show towards going in that direction, from being shown the wrongfully accused to Satoru playing the detective with his childhood friends. As the episodes progressed, however, I came to realise that there was no chance the show would be taking that route. The perpetrator becomes bleeding obvious far too early on, so all that was left was to see Satoru\u2019s progress in getting closer to them. I couldn\u2019t help but feel that the writers of Erased were treating me, the viewer, like an idiot. Any \u2018clues\u2019 they start to throw your way are as subtle as taking a tyre iron to the head. This strange misdirection Erased put me through took me some time to assess and get over.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I was left with when the show reached its final few episodes was some strange mess caught halfway between a mystery and a thriller, just floundering about and being below average at both genres. For a while there was enough in both respects to keep Erased entertaining. It seemed the less I knew about the overall picture that the more the show had me by the hook. But as it peels away the layers of the story guarding the identity of the culprit it tore away my emotional investment. There aren\u2019t enough interwoven clues in the story to be deemed a rewarding mystery yet there is nowhere near enough tension to labelled a competent thriller. Is there at least some interesting character dynamics to cling on to? Not really. Because the characters at the centre of the conflict aren\u2019t compelling \u2013 particularly the culprit \u2013 I didn\u2019t find myself on the edge of my seat when I was clearly being prompted to. Erased is, essentially, a show with no identity.\\n\\n\r\nErased ultimately abandons its \u2018mystery\u2019 and spends far too long building up the relationship between Satoru and classmate Kayo Hinazuki in its place. In a rough defence of this, Kayo\u2019s story at least does enough to keep the show watchable. Watching her outlook on the world shift thanks to the events of the show is somewhat satisfying. Aoi Yuuki (Madoka Kaname of Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica) is a good choice as Kayo\u2019s voice actress, carrying across a certain bitterness and melancholy to the role of the downtrodden class member. Her arc at least did enough to get me invested in her character but the cast as a whole just didn\u2019t reel me in. Kayo\u2019s angle could only carry the overall story for so long, and it\u2019s clear to see the pacing then kicks up into overdrive to compensate for the lost time. As much as I didn\u2019t mind her screen time, Erased spends too much time making us care for Kayo when Satoru could have used a similar amount of attention. The character interactions suffer because Satoru\u2019s at the centre of most of them. A negative mention must also go towards Kayo\u2019s mother who was a laughably over-malicious character written that way just to stir the pot, looking at baiting an emotional response from the viewer with her abusive antics. The reasons for her behaviour are never explored and thus cheapens the attempt at generating empathy for Kayo.\\n\\n\r\nThe writing behind Satoru\u2019s character is bizarre. For a 29-year-old he seems to lose a ton of emotional maturity upon being sent back to his 10-year-old body. On top of that, for someone attempting to play the detective, logic seems devoid from Satoru. He makes some unbelievable decisions throughout the course of the show that might have been excusable for a 10 or 11-year-old to make but not someone with two decades more life experience. It\u2019s almost like the writers forgot to separate his mind from body when writing the scenes set in 1988. There actually isn\u2019t much that\u2019s memorable about Satoru\u2019s character as a whole, whether it be his older or younger self. He\u2019s a standard, cold main character that does nothing to leave an impression. We\u2019re supposed to be following his story but it feels like we\u2019re riding along the coattails of others.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s disappointing to see that the show\u2019s writing doesn\u2019t match up to its presentation. There\u2019s a few good visuals utilised to help set the tone. There are some scenes that can even be called drop-dead gorgeous. It\u2019s ultimately a wasted effort because a good script and interesting characters aren\u2019t there to make use of it. The motivations of the perpetrator are glossed over to the point where I even questioned why on earth I even bothered to use my brain to try and search for the answer myself. The reasoning was so unsatisfying it actually made me angry, considering it was what set the entire series into action. I\u2019m not a manga reader of the series but, from what I have discerned, the writers left a massive chunk of information out of this area. The best villains in fiction are flawed for reasons we can understand, when we are given reasons for their actions that we can dwell upon. If you come into Erased expecting something of that sort, then prepare to be left sorely disappointed. \\n\\n\r\nAfter a first episode that got me hooked Erased began to stall, then ultimately collapse under the weight of all that it was trying to take on in the space of 12 episodes. No amount of decent visuals from A-1 Pictures could fix their clunky handling of the story, mostly forgettable cast and simply shambolic writing choices. Conveniences that lay around every corner go a long way to distracting me from any tension director Tomohiko Itou (Sword Art Online, Gin no Saji) was attempting to layer into the story. There always feels like a way out no matter how cornered or dangerous a situation seems to be. Satoru\u2019s revival ability isn\u2019t explored or explained in great detail, making itself useful at the most convenient of times. Many parts of the story feel irrelevant considering the conclusion the show arrives at. Erased seems like an appropriate title for a show that won't be hanging around in my memory for long.\\n",

            "content": "Spoilers ahead!\r\nOverall: 4/10\r\nERASED is the single most overrated anime I have ever come across. The fact that this is a 9.08/10 on MAL at the time of writing is unbelievable. Please completely disregard the reviewing credibility of those proclaiming this anime as a masterpiece and a 10/10 because it most definitely not.  \r\nStory: 3/10\r\nThis is the worst part about the show. The story was an absolute trainwreck that fails to be intriguing or interesting at any point. The mystery element of the show is absolutely dreadful as it was clear who was the killer from the start. This meant the suspense of the storywas completely meaningless due to the fact that Yashiro was the only person that the show indicated the killer to be. It was the most obvious reveal for a poor excuse for a villain I have EVER seen. The last few episodes were also very anti climatic and rushed, with a last episode being the worst example of these problems. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10\\n\r\nNow, the characters of ERASED aren't all that bad; but they're nothing special, either. I thought Satoru, Hinazuki and Satoru's mum were all decent characters, but I don't feel the same about any of the others. All of Satoru's friends were relatively uninteresting with no defining qualities and they remained quite one-dimensional throughout the story, blindly following Satoru in his quest to save children from loneliness with no real motives of their own. \\n\r\nFollowing this, Hinzauki's mother was the poorest character of them all, with her abuse of her daughter being justified through \"oh she was a victim too\". She also shows no motives for her abuse of Hinazuki but simply beats her as a plot device. \\n\r\nYashiro is a close second to the worst character of the anime. The show spouted some mumbo jumbo shit expecting the viewers to buy the poor justification it gives to Yashiro's killing.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nI liked the OP and ED of the series and this was probably the aspect of the show I liked the most. The OP was riddled with imagery and meaningful aspects. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\r\nThe art of the show was pretty average to be honest. I liked the style and some scenes had excellent use of colour but there were a few CGI shots that I felt to be out of place that detached me from the experience. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10\\n\r\nI looked forward to every episode of the show during the first 3 episodes but after that I started to easily notice the problems that the anime had and the lack of suspense in this \"mystery\" anime.",

That actually seemed a bit weird, why is that even there?\\n\\n\r\n-Characters\\n\r\nFinally something I even have a few positive things to say about.\\n\r\nSatoru's mom is made to be a very compassionate person, maybe even overly so, but i can't complain because there's a real lack of decent parents in anime.\\n\r\nMost of the characters don't have that much personality behind them, but at least they're not cardboard cut outs.\\n\r\nSatoru himself is a very cynical MC, those have been very popular lately, he develops pretty much like you would expect.\\n\r\nSo at least halfway decent main cast, but as I said before Some characters are just obviously evil and have no redeeming qualities.\\n\r\nThe killer is also a completely uninteresting character.\\n\r\nSatoru's friends at least got a personality quirk or two.\\n\r\nAnd the pizza girl whoever she was felt like a pretty pointless character.\\n\\n\r\n-Summary\\n\r\nThe best thing I could compare this anime to is Mirai nikki, That one is also completely filled with plot holes and has a cool premise that doesn't really work out.\\n\r\nIt's not a good watch if you want a mystery, it's not good as a thriller and it only kinda works as a drama.\\n\r\nAt the very least it's presented nicely so it's easy to consume.\\n\r\nUnless you absolutely need to watch a Time travel Drama and can't just watch Steins;Gate again there's nothing here for you.\\n\r\nIt's not like this is the worst thing ever but it was still a big waste of potential.\\n\r\nPS. can we all just collectively agree to never hype shit up again?",

            "content": "Overview:\r\nI'm late to this party, but I'm kind of glad I took my time to review this series. This anime got absurdly overrated and overhyped back when it came out for reasons I never understood. It's been 3 long years since then...and this is still one of the most overrated anime on MAL. The series has little moments where it has potential. It's not THAT bad on a technical level. I gave it a VERY generous 5 because I really don't believe in rating bombing. Otherwise, I would create 10 clone accounts and keep giving it a 1. I just sit back and laugh thatthis garbage is sitting at an 8.5+ rating 3 years later. Even the most \"filthy casual\" anime can laugh at Erased. This is a series that doesn't deserve to shine Gundam Wing's shoes or stand in the presence of Inuyasha. Elfen Lied wipes its ass with Erased. Then again, I can't spend this entire review talking about its MAL rating, so let's get on with it!\\n\\n\r\nPlot and characters:\\n\\n\r\nThe main character is a 29 year old manga artist named Satoru Fujinuma. He has a mysterious super power called \"The Revival\" that allows him to travel back in time a few minutes and alter history. He uses this a few minutes into the first episode to prevent a fatal traffic accident. Throughout the series, Satoru's powers never seem to follow any consistent rules. We don't understand how he gained The Revival. We don't understand the mechanism by which it works. We don't know shit about The Revival...other than IT GOES HARD (HARD) ALL DAY ALL NIGHT! (cough) I deeply apologize for that joke. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, Satoru's mother suddenly figures out who the real killer was that murdered several of Satoru's classmates back in elementary school. For some reason, the real killer instantly realizes that she figured it out and kills Mrs. Fujinuma. Satoru walks in to see that his mother has been stabbed to death and then the police instantly burst in and think he did it for some reason. Fortunately, The Revival triggers and Satoru is sent back in time 18 years. Now Satoru must find out who the killer is and prevent the murders from taking place. The next few episodes are actually pretty decent. Satoru helps a childhood friend who is dealing with domestic abuse and the anime tackles this topic with surprising grace. The good times don't last though, because this is only 12 episodes and we find out very quickly who the killer is. Hint, it's the guy that looks blatantly evil. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSatoru is able to prevent several murders and here is where the series really goes downhill. The killer gains this absolute obsession with Satoru and the thrill of having a rival. The anime tries REALLY hard to force this Batman/Joker dynamic, but it doesn't have enough time to feel remotely natural. The killer figures out the Satoru is the one thrwarting his plans and leaves Satoru locked in a car that he drives into the middle of a lake. We flash forward 18 years and Satoshi wakes out of a coma. How the hell was he rescued from the bottom of the lake? The anime never tells us. Fuck you! That's how! It is revealed that the killer has been anxiously waiting this entire time for Satoru to wake up and hasn't killed anyone in that whole time because it would be no fun without his rival to try and stop him. Satoru completes him and life is meaningless without his rivalry with Satoru. Are you fucking kidding me?! Satoru stopped a couple murders and temporarily set back his child killing scheme for a few months. This dynamic worked in The Killing Joke, because Batman and Joker had 50 fucking years of history together! Satoru nabs the bad guy in an incredibly contrived set up and everything ends happily. Well...besides Satoru spending his entire young adult life in a coma in this timeline. The End.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound:\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation by A-1 Pictures was fine here. A lot of people love to shit on A-1 because they made SAO, but it really wasn't that bad. Oh and BTW, Erased happens to share a director with SAO. Just an interesting bit of trivia. The soundtrack was handled by the talented Yuki Kajiura, who has done far better work on series like Baccano. However, I have no complaints about the music. It's fine.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nErased is a very condensed manga adaptation that had about 12 unforgivable flaws for every one thing it did right. Most of us have series that we love despite being heavily flawed. Hellsing Ultimate, Parasyte, and Fate/Zero are all series I love despite them having laughably stupid plots. I love Berserk 97 despite the fact it's barely animated. I love this one anime that had budget problems so severe that it ended with a 2 episode philosophy powerpoint. My frustration with Erased is not just that it had a few flaws, it's that watching Erased is an infurating experience. You board the plane and it has technical issues and sits on the runway for 2 hours. Then it finally gets into the air and you're sitting there like \" Ok, this is fine\". Then one of the engines explode and the plane nosedives right into the New York City dump. That's essentially what it's like to watch Erased. This is one case where you REALLY can't trust the MAL rating. I'd highly recommend skipping this one.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Boku dake ga Inai Machi, also known as Erased, is a show that exploded in popularity at the start of 2016. When a show with this much popularity arrive on the scene, you can bet on the vast continuum of viewers out there. Some would hate the show with a passion, some would love the show with equal passion, and a lot of viewers in between. I am someone who, based on the score I\u2019ve given, would be seen in the group of fans that loved it. Indeed, I have. Here are my thoughts of Erased, and it\u2019s going to be a long one, folks.\r\nTostart with, I am a fan of time-travelling stories. And because I am well acquainted with time-travelling, I know the common pitfalls and problems people have with a show such as Erased. Yes, the mechanic of time-travelling is very flawed. Neither was the mechanic of time-travelling even explained in detail. I believe that\u2019s the point. The goal of this anime isn\u2019t about creating some kind of reasonable realistic time-travelling show. If you watch this show hoping that they will explain why our protagonist is giving the power to do so, you will be disappointed. Perhaps its original source material will eventually progress to that point, but it didn\u2019t seem to be the core theme of the show.\\n\\n\r\nErased, to me, is a show about the hypothetical question of, \u201cwhat would you do differently in your life if you had the choice?\u201d Like the person who asks this question, the show is not interested in answering a completely different question of \u201chow do you even make that possible?\u201d The person mostly wants to know about your values, beliefs, past experiences, and where you would want to change if you had the choice. Erased, then, is focused on our main protagonist, Satoru Fujinuma, and how Satoru goes about answering this question. In this aspect, Erased is similar to the movie \u201cIt\u2019s a Wonderful Life\u201d. The supernatural element of both fictions is there to emphasize the growth of characters and provide a means for these characters to look at themselves in a different light. Similarly, a recent movie \u201cAbout Time\u201d showed a very similar impression to Erased\u2019s time-travelling mechanic. It was never explained in detail but used more as a plot device to highlight character development. A certain level of suspension of disbelief is needed when it comes to these shows. If you are going in this show with the wrong expectations such as comparing Erased to say, Steins;Gate, you will be very disappointed. \\n\\n\r\nAt the same time, Erased also isn\u2019t entirely focused on the murder mystery. Much of the backdrop is indeed based on Satoru investigating and attempting to prevent a string of murders from ever happening, but it isn\u2019t the main element that will stick with you after the series end. At its core, Erased is a character drama that let us see the mind of Satoru and the progress he makes, the hardships he endures, and how he develops from a rather indifferent and uncaring character at the beginning to an endearing character at the end. \\n\\n\r\nAt the beginning, we see a brief interaction with his mother Sachiko and see Satoru mildly annoyed that she is going to stay with him for a few days. We don\u2019t really know what their relationship is like, but it seems there is distance between them. Toward the end, we have no question about what that relationship really is. We see Sachiko unconditionally care for Satoru and how much he means to her. We have no doubt that Satoru means the world for her, and how much she means to him. Compared to the beginning of the show, we know that Satoru\u2019s views on family had changed. We also see Satoru opening up to other children and people, becoming more honest, learning and understanding about himself; to finally see him grow into a more complete and caring character. Near the end, we see a photo of Satoru with his friends, which set up a very neat comparison to his life in the beginning of the show.\\n\\n\r\nAlong the way, several themes related to the concept of family were explored. Satoru is raised in a single-mother home with a loving mom who\u2019s a bit too good at knowing what he is thinking. Kayo Hinazuki, the main victim that Satoru felt obligated to save, is a girl who\u2019s been consistently abused by her mother, also living in a single-mother home. The show examines what we typically take for granted in a family and shows a clear contrast between a loving parent and a despicable one. One of the most emotional scenes in the show was Kayo seeing a delicious breakfast meal made for her in Satoru\u2019s home when quick flashbacks showed how poorly her mom treated her in the past. Parental abuse isn\u2019t entirely a new concept in anime, but Erased explores it well on how characters would interact with each other and the small subtleties such as seeing a good meal for the first time.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps more importantly, Erased understands that issues do not occur in a vacuum. Kayo\u2019s mother, despite being obviously one of the clear \u201cvillains\u201d in this show, is shown to have been abused before and is clearly under some kind of substance abuse. As an empathetic viewer, I can see that even though she mistreated her daughter over and over again, I can\u2019t really blame her entirely. Bad things happen to people, and it tends to spread quite easily. Of course, she was definitely in the wrong, but just a little of empathy goes out to her as well.\\n\\n\r\nWith that said, it becomes a bit puzzling that the same consideration was not made of the main antagonist. Several people have critiqued Erased\u2019s pacing, specifically the latter third of the show. Little backstory was provided about the villain. Here, we see a similar problem akin to the time-travelling problems I discussed earlier. Erased treats the villain mostly as a plot device and a premise of the show rather than highlight any meaningful character development in said person. Much of the development is focused on Satoru, Sachiko, and Kayo, with some minor focus on Kenya and Airi. This problem, to me, appears to be a logistics issue outside the merit of the show itself. It seems 12-13 episode series had become all too common so our perception that the show felt rushed in the latter halves should at least be somewhat accurate. With a 12-13 episode limit, it would be hard to actually shed light on many character motivations, which definitely leaves some room for criticism and improvement.\\n\\n\r\nOther criticisms are also quite valid. One common issue aside from time-travelling is a time skip that happens later on in the show. This is especially problematic because Erased seem to have forgotten that this event ever happened and fails to shed any light on what actually happened. Even for me, as someone who acknowledges that time-travelling is merely used as a plot device with its fair share of plot holes, this appeared to simply be a plot hole with no excuses attached. \\n\\n\r\nAnother issue was how obvious who the real antagonist was. The show doesn\u2019t really show enough possibilities to leave us guessing. As a crime show, Erased lacks quite a bit in the area. We\u2019re pretty sure who the antagonist is, even though the show tries to create doubt in its viewers. At some points, I truly wished the antagonist wasn\u2019t this person, but with such a limited cast, it felt like the show had no other choice but this person to be the villain. And when this person is poorly introduced in their motives and background, it really would dampen your opinions on the show especially if you went in expecting an excellent crime drama. That said, Erased do excel in creating suspense in certain parts of the show. An obvious example is having the antagonist enter the same place that Kayo was currently placed. Again, this really isn\u2019t a novel idea, but I haven\u2019t felt real suspense in anime for quite a bit so it\u2019s refreshing to have moments like these where you are at the edge of your seat on what will happen next.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, I want to bring another concern that I noted when watching this show. When it comes to characters, one particular character acts way, way wiser than what an elementary school child should be. This character\u2019s role seemed like yet another plot device, or an exposition device. If a scenario got too awkward, this character would come in. If there is a burning question that the audience had in mind, this character would ask or answer. While it\u2019s fine to have that element in the show, it asks a bit too much out of its viewers to suspend disbelief. We know why this character is here, but this character did not really fit how children are supposed to act and behave. That said, it\u2019s not like really smart and wise children don\u2019t exist... but this character appeared just a biiiit too mature for its viewers to suspend disbelief.\\n\\n\r\nYou might have realized I have not talked about the show\u2019s animation, art or music. There isn\u2019t much to be said in these departments. It\u2019s all around quality material. A-1 is known to create decent artwork and animation, and the music can be spot on in its tender moments and suspenseful moments. The food looks delicious, the lighting is spot on, characters that only have like one dialogue looks unique enough, and there\u2019s enough settings to please the eye.\\n\\n\r\nIn summary, I\u2019ll say Erased excelled in creating a character drama where you can become wholly emotionally invested into its characters. I have cried on at least 3 occasions, probably because the topic of family is such a sensitive issue for me. Many viewers will be disappointed with Erased, either because time-travelling is poorly explained, the main antagonist being a bit too obvious, or that the latter parts of the series felt rushed. These are all legitimately valid criticisms and I appreciate the fanbase for dissecting this series. However, I believe the core theme of Erased is based on the complexity of family dynamics and character interactions of those involved. It highlights how bad parental abuse can be, and highlights just how difficult it is to actually try and stop what has been happening. It also highlights common themes we\u2019ve loved about in anime: friendship, trust, and moral dilemmas on what we believe as right or wrong. In these aspects, Erased had well-crafted characters in Satoru, Sachiko, Kayo, and even some of its side characters.\\n\\n\r\nAs you can probably tell from the score and this long review, I enjoyed Erased immensely. I have described some of its flaws, but as we all probably heard this quote before: \u201cLove isn't about finding a perfect person; it's seeing an imperfect person perfectly.\u201d As I reiterate and this applies to all works of fiction: If you watch something with the wrong expectations, you will surely be disappointed. Despite Erased\u2019s immense popularity, it definitely isn\u2019t a show for everyone. It demands its viewers to suspend quite a bit of disbelief, which is perhaps asking a bit too much.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, if you are open-minded and understood the main themes that Erased tried to get across, then hopefully you would or had enjoyed the series as much as I had.",

            "content": "The Bystander Effect, when an individual fails to react appropriately to an emergency situation because of the presence of other people. This is the overlooked basis of Erased, which points out that Satoru's own apathy toward the people around him when he was a child as being the cause to his situation in the present. The \"present\" being one in which someone close to him has been brutally murdered, and he is now considered the likely suspect by authorities.\r\nThis apathy is not something exclusive to Satoru, it is a common in most people. Even when we see something that we consider alarming, we often overlookit in hopes that someone else will do something about it first. We don't want to break social norms or risk consequences of going out of our way. So while Satoru is our protagonist, it isn't about his negligence specifically but about how in classroom full of people, when the signs were all there that someone needed help, no one outstretched their hand.\\n\\n\r\nErased is not alone about Satoru and his group of friends learning that their actions, no matter how small, have far reaching consequences that can be positive ones. It is also about child abuse and how the system is setup in such a way that children often can't get the help that they need even when authorities are alerted. This series isn't content to be entertainment; it's a social commentary on how small acts of kindness and inclusion can save lives.\\n\\n\r\nMost people reviewing and watching seem to misconstrue this for a whodunnit suspense series, but this isn't Scooby Doo. Erased is not asking you to search for the culprit, which is why the \"big reveal\" left many dissatisfied. It puts the victims in the spotlight where the media has taught us to ignore their stories. We learn about Kayo, we watch her bond with Satoru and we come to care about her. For us and for Satoru, it is no longer about saving the present where he is 29 years old; it is about saving the past where a person in front of him that he has come to care about is in very real danger of being a victim. The reveal is meant to have impact because of what it does to Satoru, not because it's supposed to be a shock to the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Erased is not one that is particularly new and inventive with its mechanics, we have seen time travel in many series before that have scored high ratings. Its creativity lies in its presentation of the material. The series presents itself as a gripping mystery, building suspense and momentum every episode. We begin with a murder in the first episode that reels in the viewer. From there, the pacing in each episode is such that the tension just continues to build and we end almost every one with a cliffhanger that keeps the viewer wanting to watch more.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the emphasis is not intended to be on the revelation of the Big Bad, Erased does do quite a clever job of misleading the viewer into thinking so and becoming invested. This deception has to be intentional, because were it not, then Erased would be one of the worst murder mysteries in the history of anime. Given how well it portrays child abuse and stresses the message of believing in and supporting other people, it seems difficult to think the author simply got lazy with the mystery of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, the explanations provided for the villain's motive feel insubstantial as a viewer. This could be intentional on part of the anime creators because, ultimately, truly evil people do not have \"motives.\" Their minds work on a different level than most peoples and their actions tend to be incomprehensible to us. That said, they still have their own rationale that they are working with and while we may not understand it, it is something we can analyze. In the manga this was detailed better than the anime, and its absence is felt even if one could argue that there wasn't enough time to add it in.\\n\\n\r\nErased has a symbolic opening and ending, although the depth of meaning of both of these songs may be lost on an English-only speaking audience. I would recommend looking up translations of these lyrics because it may give you a better appreciation for how well they set the tone of the series. The opening especially encompasses Satoru's conflicting emotions, particularly his guilt and frustration at not realizing what he had around him until it was already gone.\\n\\n\r\nThe series has appropriate music to the set the tone for each scene. It knows when to cut the music because sometimes silence can carry enough impact on its own. That said, on the whole, the soundtrack isn't particularly memorable outside of its opening and closing.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice cast features primarily experienced seiyuu that support two new rookies, both of whom voice Satoru. Mitsushima Shinnosuke voices an older Satoru while Tsuchiya Tao voices his younger self. The two of them do an amazing job for being put in such a demanding role. While there are moments where their lack of experience shows, it rarely detracts from the emotion and depth of the character they portray.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation for Erased is superb, because the director purposefully tailored the characters to look much softer in comparison to their manga counterparts. The lines are not as sharp, because he wanted to give a more inviting atmosphere to the viewer especially seeing the children on screen. This was the perfect choice because it really immerses the viewer in the world and invites a positive, naive perception that falls in line with how the children see the world. The added effect of the video reel borders in the flashback give an added distinct feel to how Satoru views the world, specifically in regards to his \"revivals.\" All throughout the anime there are small details like these that go unnoticed by the viewer because they are added in so seamlessly.\\n\\n\r\nFor all the praise I have delivered to multiple facets on the series, my enjoyment if probably less than I would rate any other category. It isn't to say that I didn't love the series on the whole because I did. However, like everyone else, although I could appreciate the reason why the focus was not on the unveiling of the antagonist, the series setup my expectations for it. I went in and was reeled in again and again every week, waiting for the inevitable twist that I trusted the show to deliver. It was predictable and fell short, and whether that was purposeful or not, I walk away feeling a little betrayed by the expectations the show setup for me.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, I still really appreciate the depth that Erased brought with its plot and with its characters. It masqueraded as one thing only to surprise us and be something entirely different. At the end, the message was something that was so obvious that most of us probably missed it. At any point in our lives we may see someone in need of help, and without thinking we may dismiss the option to give that person a hand on the basis that surely someone else will help them. The problem with that thinking is that other people will fall into the same line of thinking. Then who will help those in need? So ultimately, it's about paying more attention to small interactions that could change another person's life. Erased reminds us that both small and large acts of kindness can be the difference in saving someone's life.",

            "content": "Man, the amount of negativity the director is getting is insane...You guys do realize that the director is the reason why ERASED got an anime adaptation right? That's usually the producer's (Aniplex and Kadokawa) job, not the director. He basically convinced Aniplex and Kadokawa to produce an anime adaptation but they only gave him and A-1 Pictures 12 episodes. I honestly believe the hate towards him is unjustified and it's obvious he tried his best to fit everything in 12 episodes. He probably wanted this series to be 2 cour because no one is dumb enough to adapt a manga with 44 chapters in 12episodes. Anyways, I'll explain somewhere below why I gave this show with a score of 9. \\n\\n\r\n(There will be SPOILERS in my review) \\n\\n\r\n[Story]: (8/10)\\n\r\n29 years old struggling manga author Satoru Fujinuma has a special ability. He can prevent someone's death or catastrophe by being sent back in time before the incident occurs. One day, he was framed and his ability sent him back in time to when he was a grade schooler a month before his fellow classmate Kayo Hinazuki went missing. Satoru now embarks on a new quest to save Sayo and solve the mystery behind her disappearance. \\n\\n\r\nWhen I first heard about this series back in January, I didn't really care about this series that much. I mean, Mystery/Thriller and A-1 Pictures does not go well together. When I finally decided to go and watch the first episode, I was intrigued but it wasn't until the 2nd episode where the show pulled me in like I was stuck on a fish bait. Amazing premise, elementary school setting but has a mature theme, great character interactions and of course, that phenomenal \"Park scene\". The Park Scene where Satoru confronted Kayo is the main reason why I fell in love with the show. Basically, it showed Satoru and Kayo's bond building and growing perfectly accompanied with one of the best cinematography in the anime industry that I have ever seen and clever use of imagery which made the scene more impactful. I was surprised considering the fact that this series was being directed by Itou Tomohiko, who is by the way, the same director as Sword Art Online. Going back to the first episode, they did a great job getting right to the action. They didn't take a very long time explaining who the main protagonist is, how his ability works, and etc. while at the same time keeping a steady pace.    \\n\\n\r\nI'm a big fan of time travel like \"S;G\" and also a big fan of mysteries like \"Hyouka\" and ERASED has both elements. I'm very strict when it comes to time travelling and since I'm very strict, I would have docked a shit ton of points from ERASED because they never explained where he got his ability from and how the world is being affected with the use of his ability. Hell, they never even explained why he and only he has the ability and not someone else. \"I would\" if this was a sci-fi show except it's not. The whole point of this show is the murder mystery and not the time travel itself. Besides, KEY's anime does the exact same thing. Remember Little Busters: Refrain and Clannad: After Story? Characters can somehow time travel back in time to fix whatever they need to fix and we (and also I) don't have a problem with that. Since I'm not a hypocrite, I also don't have a problem with ERASED not explaining how the MC got the ability. I only have one problem with ERASED's time travel though and it's the scene where he was able to use his ability when he wasn't even able to do so. Didn't the first episode say that his ability is activated when someone is about to die? Then how the hell was he able to use his ability at the time he got arrested? Seems to me that his ability was activated for the sake of plot. \\n\\n\r\nThough, for the most part, the time travel aspect of the show is used fairly well and I don't think it failed on that aspect. Now to talk about the mystery and how well did the staff handle the mystery. Answer? Decent but not great..They dropped way too many hints in this show which is a big no-no in a mystery show. Like who is this show targeted for? Dumb ass little kids? They dropped a hint in Ep. 3, they dropped another one in Ep, 5, and another one in Ep. 6 and another one in the future episodes. Hell, the killer was spoiled in the OP. Honestly, they could have taken out like 75% of the hints. I mean, the teacher became so suspicious to me because of the cliffhanger in Ep. 6. To make things short, the reveal was quite predictable and they probably could have done a better job hiding and not revealing too much hints. The show did try to steer the viewer's eyes away from the teacher at times. Like how there were times where I thought Kenya would be the killer or maybe Jun. \\n\\n\r\nEven though the reveal was quite predictable, I was still heavily engaged because watching Saturo figuring out who the killer is and doing everything he can to save Hinazuki was entertaining and it never got boring...at all! Every time a new episode comes out every week, I would ready my pop and chips and lock my room with my lights turned off. I have only done that 5 times in my life which proves how much I enjoyed ERASED. I would always be on the edge of my seat and once the episode ends, I would curse the show for its effective use of cliffhanger. Based on what I\u2019ve just said, that should tell you that the show did an outstanding job on the \u201cThriller\u201d element which should also explain why there are so many hints in the show which made the killer somewhat predictable. Do you really think A-1 Pictures is that bad at hiding the killer? In an interview with Crunchyroll, the director did intend ERASED to be a \u201cThriller\u201d show rather than a mystery. Now you know why I rated this show with a score of 9?  \\n\\n\r\nAnother reason why I love this show is the emotional and dramatic elements in this show. A-1 Pictures is the master of melodramatic animes and I'm not really a big fan of melodramatic scenes. Thank God, that wasn't the case here. ERASED has a right amount of drama, whether that's Kayo crying when she ate breakfast with Satoru and his mother or Airi explaining why she's helping Satoru out. The emotional scenes worked because the characters have been given enough development to make me care for them. I was so invested in Kayo that when she cried during that breakfast scene, I knew how she felt and I knew why she was crying. I gotta admit, I also cried a little and there were legit tears in my eyes. Moving on, I now want to talk about the pacing and the ending. \\n\\n\r\nIf you have watched an A-1 Pictures before and I'm sure you have at least watched one, you know that A-1 Pictures does not have a good track record with their pacing. Their show either ends up as a messy rushed adaptation or a painful boring slow ass adaptation. So does ERASED fall in the former or the latter? I'd say it's in the middle. A-1 Pictures adapted a manga that has 44 chapters and they tried to do so in 12 episodes. The first half of the show had a perfect pacing. It didn't go too slow nor did it go too fast. However, in the second half of the show, the pacing started to sped up which wasn't a surprise. Here's what I found surprising though, the final episode's pacing wasn't too rushed. I mean, it was still somewhat rushed but not as rushed as Charlotte, which had a messy and very rushed ending. Even though ERASED's ending was somewhat rushed, it was still a satisfying ending for me. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[ERASED's effective use of its title]\\n\r\n\"Boke dake ga Inai Machi\" or in English \"The Town Where Only I Am Missing\" is a very smart and genius title and very impactful once you know what it means. Just like \"Your Lie in April\", the ending pretty much explain what the title means. Like seriously, I thought the title referred referred to Kayo disappearing but I was so wrong. \"The Town where only I am missing\" is about Satoru sacrificing himself for 15 years to bring his friends happiness. He gave them peace and happiness but he wasn't there because he was in a coma. He was \"missing\" in a \"town\"that he lived in. Boke dake ga Inai Machi wasn't Kayo's story. It was her essay that was shown in Ep. 2 called \"Watashi Dake ga Inai Machi\". We all know the story. She wanted to go to a faraway island so she doesn't get hurt anymore. If you look at the story from another standpoint, she's no longer being abused by her mother and has gained her freedom because she's dead. She's no longer part of the town. I've already said it and I wanted to say it again, both the title of the show and the essay are genius. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]: (9/10)\\n\r\nEach season, A-1 Pictures produces a lot of shows per season so their animation quality is either decent or great. For this show, it falls on the latter. The thing is, they couldn't keep the animation quality consistent. Especially the character designs. In the first half, they looked great but in the second half, I kind of noticed a decrease in quality. The decrease is not that big though so don't think that the animation will suddenly turn into Shinsekai yori. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Sound]: (10/10)\\n\r\nSerious question..Does ERASED have the same composer as SAO? If you listen to the background theme used in emotional scenes, it sounds exactly the same as the one used in SAO II Mother's Rosario's emotional scenes and I'm sure I'm not going crazy because there were at least 2 other people who said the exact same thing. Either way, I really don't care if the theme is recycled because it's a great theme to begin with. Now the OP and ED theme song(s). \\n\\n\r\nThe OP theme song is Re: Re: by Asian Kung Fu Generation and the ED theme song is #2: \"Sore wa Chiisana Hikari no Youna\" by Sayuri. This should explain why I gave the \"Sound\" section a perfect score of 10. It's a rarity in anime these days to both have a perfect OP and ED theme song but ERASED managed to do just that. The OP theme song is great and syncs perfectly with the OP Animation and honestly, I love the ED theme song because of Sayuri and the fact that it gives me chills every time I listen to it. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Characters]: (9/10)\\n\r\nI have stated this in a forum post before..The characters are the second reason why I really REALLY enjoyed ERASED. The character's maturity and their unique, likable and believable personalities are the reasons why I enjoyed ERASED. So what makes these characters great? Let's find out..\\n\\n\r\nFirst, we have Saturo Fujinuma, a depressed 29 year old manga author who regrets the actions that he did in the past. In the original timeline, He regrets not doing anything to save a lonely classmate who always hanged around the park. He could have done something but he didn't. Deep down inside though, he cares about her and now that he's ability sent him back to when he was an elementary schooler, he can now prove that he cares by saving a certain classmate. When Satoru was sent back as a kid, I thought he was going to be an immature and annoying little shit but he retained his adult personality. I love his character because the fact that he's doing everything in his power to save Kayo and his mother shows how much of a compassionate and caring character he is.  \\n\\n\r\nNext up is Kayo Hinazuki, a character that made ERASED a very strong show in the first and early second half. You know, instead of making every kid character in the anime a loli just to satisfy the pedophiles, Oh, I mean a \"lolicon\" because there's a clear \"difference\" between the two, why not make a kid character that you can have legit emotions to and not those creepy \"pedophilia\" emotions. The horrible shit that she went through, the way she's trying to cope with her current situation and her personality because of what she went through makes her a much more believable character. Ever since that Powerful \"Park Scene\" in Episode 2, a range of emotions that I got from her is surreal. I felt pity for her, I felt sympathetic for her, I felt as though I want to protect her from a certain person who beats the crap out of her and she even made me cry. It's pretty sad that the chances of me seeing a well-written character who manages to steal tears inside my eye and a dark and well-written backstory is very low.  \\n\\n\r\nThen there's Sachiko Fujinuma, a mother of Satoru. Sachiko is easily a mother of the year for me. I have been saying that for like 3 months right now and I still stand by my statement, despite her big lips which would made A-1 Pictures a bunch of racist chinks if she were black. Anyways.... The way she takes care of Satoru, the way she shows how much love she has for Satoru and how much support that she gives to his own son is really intriguing. She reminds me of my own mother which is one of the reasons why I love her. \\n\\n\r\nSince I won't be talking about every characters in the series, I'll skip right to  one of my favourite characters in the series Airi Katagiri. She's a teenager but that's not the reason why I like her character. It's the fact that she's a mature teenager is the reason why I like her character. Wow..an anime with a mature teenager?! The chances of me seeing a mature teenager like Airi is the same as me getting struck by lighting twice in a same spot. She has a likable personality and she's not an annoying teen character unlike most anime teenagers today who are all a bunch of violent tsunderes or some snotty rich kid who likes to show off. Airi helping Satoru out and believing in him may seem random at first but it's backed up by her backstory which might seem like a ridiculous backstory to some but not to me. You know, if I get the chance to interview the director of this show, this is the first thing I'll ask him..\"Do you hate Airi that much?\". Like this the only problem I have with Airi's character. She just didn't get enough screen time. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, whoever supports the Satoru x Airi ship are a bunch of sick f*cks. Though, I don't blame them because of what Kayo did. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]: (9/10)\\n\r\nWatching ERASED for 3 months while it was airing was a very fun ride. Everytime I get home from work in Tuesdays, I would always load up the FUNimation or Crunchyroll website and just sit, relax, and watch ERASED for 24 mins. That has been part of my routine for the past 3 months and I'm bummed out that I won't ever get to do that again anytime soon\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[VERDICT]\\n\r\nERASED may not be a masterpiece due to some flaws that cannot be simply ignored but it is one of the best anime shows I have seen. ERASED has a mature theme, the way A-1 Pictures handled the emotional scenes is simply perfect and is probably the strongest element that ERASED has, believable characters with great personalities, no fanservice and of course, the \"Thriller\" aspect of the show was really well done. Now that the show has finished airing, I won't be able to do something like locking myself in the room and watching an exciting Seasonal Anime until the Summer of 2016 because next season is full of uninteresting shounen animes.\\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL]: (8.9/10)\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+Great Story\\n\r\n+The \"Thriller\" element of the show was very well-done plus effective use of cliffhangers\\n\r\n+Powerful \"Park Scene (Ep. 2)\" with outstanding cinematography\\n\r\n+Great Animation\\n\r\n+Outstanding Soundtrack\\n\r\n+Outstanding OP and ED theme song(s)\\n\r\n+Perfect pacing in the first half of the show\\n\r\n+ERASED's number 1 strength is its emotional scenes\\n\r\n+Mature and Believable Characters\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Mystery aspect of the show was not the greatest\\n\r\n-Pacing issues in the 2nd half\\n\r\n-Slightly Rushed Ending\\n\r\n-Airi did not get enough screen time",

LA has liked time travelin media for quite a while and this won't be an exception coupled with a rather compelling mystery and LA's paranoia on this anime going through the roof which is something this anime does right.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters by all means have lots of development especially from our main protagonist Satoru but as well as most of the other cast members and they are mostly all important, LA says this as LA looked at the characters as this, they can easily be allies or traitorous people towards Satoru thus making the paranoia LA have gotten effective enough to drive the mystery. In any case, LA rather thought most of the cast were fleshed out from both trying to help Satoru and the undefined amount of paranoia towards them making them memorable.\\n\\n\r\nThere are ''some'' flaws within this anime however one which will be the typical time travel paradoxes here and there and some pacing issues does occur and the lead up to the ending makes it rather predictable. On speaking of which the ending did satisfy LA due to resolving the story going full circle and although it isn't as climactic as the reveal of the killer, the ending did not disappoint LA.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation by A-1 Pictures have a rather high quality throughout which is baffling from the previous ''The Asterisk War'', BUUT for Boku dake ga Inai Machi, LA won't complain A-1 Pictures, you did quite excellent in terms of animation.\\n\\n\r\nBoku dake ga Inai Machi is a compelling mystery, with solid characters and plot developments and sure it has it's flaws but so does MOST media, but considering this is LA's review, what did LA really think about this anime?, it was great and it's mystery was one of it's best parts of it as LA was both paranoid and wanted to find out the mystery, coupled with some great character development and an interesting premise.",

            "content": "WARNING! Somewhat biased!\r\nTHIS REVIEW IS KINDA SPOILER FREE!\r\nNever have I seen a show that while airing, the show still rises to become one of the top shows not only of its season, but of all time. Actually scratch that, because that's exactly what ERASED tried to do.\r\nWhat would you do if you could travel back to the past to stop a life changing event from happening? Sound familiar?\r\nSatoru is a normal man. He's a manga artist and a pizza boy, at age 29, living out his seemingly normal life. However, his life is anything but normal, due to an ability he has, which he dubsas \"Revival.\" With this ability, he travels to the past, usually about a minute or so into the past. This ability usually triggers right when something bad is about to happen, and it gives him time to fix it before it happens. However, after suffering from a traumatic event in the present, an extremely powerful Revival is triggered which sends him back to when he was an elementary school student. There, he believes that his Revival was triggered to stop an important event in his life from happening: the kidnapping of his classmate, Kayo.\\n\\n\r\nWhile this is the overall premise for the beginning of this show, ERASED took it in a way that leaves you wanting more. The connection that Satoru still has towards his present self made him a very intriguing character. His devotion to purposefully changing the future may not be a unique aspect to time travel anime, but I would be a liar if I didn't say I was fucking HYPED!\\n\\n\r\nWith what I believe to be one of the best first episodes in anime, ERASED immediately got me interested. And it only got better. The first episode set up the story so well that I find myself trying to imagine what the rest of the story would be like. The atmosphere was compelling, the sound track was addicting, and it promised awesomeness beyond imagination! Of course, we all watched it, and we all know what actually happened. Here's what I think of Cuckerino: the Animation!\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n- Potential beyond bounds.\\n\r\n- Main character's motivations, while not original, were still executed well.\\n\r\n- OST is beautiful and also sets up moods really nicely, and the OP is catchy and nostalgic.\\n\r\n- Brought you very deep into the main character's head, something I'm a fan of.\\n\r\n- Awesome art that fits the mood well. The characters aren't prettied up, which makes the whole series that much more realistic. \\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- After a powerful beginning, the story starts to fall off like a Shaco during late game.\\n\r\n- What the fuck is this pacing.\\n\r\n- Why is this story so predictable?\\n\r\n- Why are so many themes just forgotten about?\\n\r\n- Why are some characters so poorly written?\\n\r\n- Why was this rated so high again?\\n\r\n- Yeah...\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3\\n\r\nStarting with a very interesting premise, the story builds up from the first episode expertly well. The story is well written with fairly good pacing. It doesn't rush (at least not too much) and each episode always ends in a way that really keeps you waiting for the next episode. There are so many dark themes, from murder, child abuse, and kidnapping, to taking responsibility and appreciating the things you have, and at the time, it was executed in ways much better than other edgelord shows did.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, all this promise of a great mystery and thematically heavy show quickly gets flushed away. There is no particular backstory or reason behind some of the themes, which makes them feel out of place. The mystery itself, while compelling at first, quickly just becomes a backdrop to what seems to be a character drama/romance between a 29 year old dude and a 10 year old girl. Not that it's bad, there were some scenes that were so well executed, I couldn't even be mad. But when they try to resurface the mystery again, it's just so obvious and poorly executed that it ends up being anticlimactic, something thrillers should never be.\\n\\n\r\nAnd we all know the memes about the ending. Absolutely disgusting.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nOne thing that makes this show incredible to watch is its atmosphere. The art really synergizes with the mood of the anime and enforces the thriller and dramatic aspects of it tremendously. It's really got that suspenseful feel, and it supports the story incredibly well. The animation is also well executed, and the show is able to use different animation techniques to intensify the atmosphere. The characters aren't prettied up at all, which also contributes to the bleak nature of this show. This show definitely delivers as a visual spectacle.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nSimilar to the art, the sound of this show creates such an amazing atmosphere. The OP is incredibly catchy, and the ED is beautiful as well! However, the OST truly shines as it sets up the mood incredibly well at the thrilling and dramatic parts. The voice actors for both versions of Satoru fit their characters nicely, and the idea of having kid Satoru still use his adult voice for interior thoughts to show he still had his more mature mindset was a really cool idea. Again, this show is also an audio spectacle.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4\\n\r\nFor a show with art and atmosphere dedicated to realistic suspense, the characters couldn't be the furthest from realistic. The interactions between all of them were pretty refreshing, and each character had their own separate characteristics, yet they were all so idealized smartasses that it hindered the suspense of the show. Making them stand out from other side characters from other shows as being way too smart or mature for their age may make them memorable, but it makes them bad as well. Some characters were so one dimensional, they make One Direction go in two directions. Some characters, like Kayo, who was supposed to be the center plot point of the show, gets treated as just that: a plot device. And when she no longer becomes part of the plot, the entire plot just falls apart even more. The villain of this show, holy shit, absolutely atrociously written and ruined the whole mystery of the show. The fact that the slice of life moments are easily the best parts for the characters is saying something, for it was only during these moments that they felt like real people, and this is a mystery thriller we are talking about.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nDespite my criticisms, I had a blast watching this show. Whether it was because I was genuinely engrossed at the beginning, or having fun making fun of the show by the end, it was still enjoyable and I do recommend it to some degree.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5\\n\r\nWatch it for the experience and so that you can talk about it, but don't watch it for any sort of well thought out mystery plot.\\n",

            "content": "This anime is just perfect. I really feel sad about the many negative reviews that    this anime receives because of the fact that the main character doesn't use his power often. It's true that he uses it 2 or 3 times along the story, however these people who wrote that reviews don't realize that he always use his power in the crucial moments, such as he gets arrested. It's true that it is a great power, but it's also true that that power is not necessary to abuse of it so that become the anime more enjoyable, its already entertaining :p. Itseems like the creators decided to focus more on the past instead the present to change the future. I think that focus was really necessary because in Satoru's present there was an awkward situation with the issues of the persecution, the unknown causes of the deaths of the girls, etc. All of this gets arranged with the acts that were carried out by Satoru in the past, without using his power. Despite the issue of the power, let's talk about the cast of this anime. Overall it seems to me improvable. There are situations where the personalities os some characters may become a little strange, for example the attitude of Kenya on the early days when Satoru reaches the past. Another thing that I loved on this anime was the way in which the creators managed to transmit the feelings of the character to the viewers. At least on my case I felt every tense situation that Satoru lived along the story. From the beginning to the end.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 8\\n\\n\r\nAs I said the cast of this anime could be inprovable, anyway the character development is very good as the story progresses. The fact of the time travel that happen to Satoru, let us know more about him and the others characters. We discover his fears, his likes, etc. All the characters that are presented both in the past and in the future are very good, above all, the murderer and the mother of Satoru.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 10\\n\\n\r\nThe story begins very strong, however there's a decrease since the seventh episode. That decrease is fixed as Satoru started to arrange the problems of the present, such as the case of Kayo. Besides it has much merit the fact of developing a good story between two times without breaking the plot or the story.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I really recommend this anime to all of those who love the seinen animes, the animes that have nice stories and animes that trasmit feelings.\\n\\n\r\nThank you very much for reading my review and I hope that it could assist you ;)",

            "content": "When it involves new anime, hype usually starts with something small, the cause either due to a title being created by a prominent mangaka, being produced by the studio Madhouse, or being something that very, very subtly thinks outside the box. Then, the hype surrounding this new title becomes so ridiculously out-of-proportions that there\u2019s little chance of the series fulfilling these expectations. With that said, I will introduce the 12-episode mystery known as Erased, whose birth, rise, apex, and decline in MyAnimeList.net\u2019s (MAL) Top Anime rankings epitomize the hype machine as a whole. When Erased was first released, it surpassed Cowboy Bebop, Mushishi, Death Note,Gurren Lagann, the 2011 remake of Hunter X Hunter, Monster, and even Legend of the Galactic Heroes, all considered timeless, transcendent works of the medium. Erased settled into the top 10 for a while before soaring into the top 5 and, during this voyage into the upper echelon of the Anime Hall-of-Fame, I bought a nonrefundable ticket for the ride. As someone who adamantly sticks to the older, more renowned series, I was immediately suspicious of the widespread idolation of Erased but my insatiable urge to witness what the hype was about pushed me to watch this series. Whether its ranking on MAL and my decision was ultimately justified remains to be seen.\\n\\n\r\n\tErased revolves around a time-traveling mangaka named Satoru Fujinuma venturing into the past, reverting into a child in the process a la Dragon Ball GT, to confront his mother\u2019s killer. As the drama unfolds, the series showcases a truly masterful, variety-filled soundtrack. When the focus is on R&R, soft, barely audible guitar melodies ease into the atmosphere. When the pulse-pounding suspense is at its climax, tragic violin pieces are flawlessly alternated with sweeping, powerful piano tracks. Every once in a while, Erased experiments with different combinations of music, at one point having tech house and an opera string quartet perform the Fusion Dance.\\n\\n\r\n\tThough I am helplessly enamored of the show\u2019s music, I am even more in love with the cinematic style involved in the animation of Erased. When Satoru discusses or thinks about his time-traveling powers, a film reel effect occurs with the film reel frames symbolizing Satoru watching his life so far like a movie. In episode 1, the smoke released form the cigarette of Satoru\u2019s mother guides the transition from one scene to the next. In episode 3, Satoru visits the bedroom of Yuuki, a friend from long ago, and there\u2019s a beautiful back-and-forth shift between past and present. In episode 5, there\u2019s a cutaway to a painting of The Last Supper as Satoru eats his dinner to foreshadow what will occur next. The cinematic style in Erased climaxes at the end of episode 6, where Satoru is in the rain, about to be hauled off to jail, and he spots his mother\u2019s killer. It is at that moment where everything suddenly stops (even the raindrops are frozen!) and turns black-and-white, the color erased (pun unintended) from the scene except for the killer\u2019s dark red pupils. Let\u2019s just say that what occurs in episode 6 doesn\u2019t happen too often with anime titles.\\n\\n\r\n\tAs someone with a theme song fetish, I have always believed that an anime\u2019s opening, which is often a viewer\u2019s first glance at a title, can make or break the series. That said, the theme song for Erased isn\u2019t particularly terrible but it\u2019s not memorable in any way (It will never be compared to \u201cMystical Adventure\u201d, \u201cTank!\u201d, \u201cCruel Angel\u2019s Thesis\u201d or any of the other classic theme songs). The theme song for Erased is all about Satoru: him in a theater, him on the playground, him playing Rock Paper Scissors with his friends, him screaming outside in the snow, him running away from his mother\u2019s killer (You get the point). The question: who is Satoru? He doesn\u2019t have any unique physical features, personality quirks, or any special gifts besides the whole time-travel thingy. Satoru has a purpose that drives the series forward, to protect the ones he loves and even those he doesn\u2019t know too well, but it\u2019s hardly a unique purpose. In other words, Satoru is (shocker!) yet another one of those self-insert protagonists that I despise with a passion. Unfortunately, most of the supporting cast don\u2019t fare much better when it involves depth and uniqueness. Hinazuki is the main female character of erased, one of those quiet loner types that never get a chance to really develop, a damsel-in-distress relying a little too much on Satoru to rescue her, and a child that acts nothing like a child (More on this later). Airi is one of Satoru\u2019s co-workers with what\u2019s easily the dumbest backstory ever (#candybarsarecursed). Kenya is a quiet, abnormally intelligent scholar of a child seeking to protect others just like Satoru (Kenya is, unfortunately, not black). The only person in Erased that actually acts like a real person is Mr. Yashiro, my favorite character. At first, Satoru\u2019s teacher appears as relatable as possible whose gentle, relaxed personality resembles that of a midmorning autumn breeze. However, the depths of Mr. Yashiro\u2019s soul reveal a mortal man marked by obsession, rejection, and an obvious yet intriguing plot twist. If only the rest of the cast of Erased were as complex as Mr. Yashiro\u2026\\n\\n\r\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t dig deeper, the readers won\u2019t be able to see you in the work,\u201d \u2013 Satoru\u2019s editor (Episode 1)\\n\\n\r\n\tAbove all else, this is the underlying cause of every issue in Erased. When I look at Erased, I discover an ambitious young writer filled with larger-than-life ideas for his work but doesn\u2019t know how to fully express them or inject his personality into his writing. This problem is apparent in Erased having some serious pacing issues and in the show not knowing what it wants to be (Erased is generally labeled a mystery but there are also sci-fi elements, an insane amount of time spent on the school grounds, and it mostly feels like a simple slice-of-life than a gripping suspense-thriller. Honestly, Erased would\u2019ve been better had it stayed loyal to the mystery aspect). Spawning from the show\u2019s lack of structure are, of course, the plot holes issue, like not explaining the effects of Satoru\u2019s time-traveling or how he acquires this ability in the first place. It is obvious a little before the 15-year time skip but, afterwards, the animation style that I obsess over is decimated almost entirely, the once-overpowering OST lacks its flair for the dramatic, the plot isn\u2019t as intense, and overall Erased just isn\u2019t the absurdly addictive thriller that it used to be. The last (and probably most crucial) thing I don\u2019t like about the author of Erased is how he characterizes children in his story; it\u2019s like he was never truly a child himself. Me, I can easily recall and cherish my childhood. Being a young boy was building the biggest castle in the sandbox. Being a young boy was making fun of other boys who wanted or had relationships with a girl (Back then, we thought they were infested with \u201ccooties\u201d). Being a young boy was riding your bicycle down the street by yourself to the grocery store so that you could feel like \u201ca real man\u201d. Being a young boy was doing what you previously thought was scary or impossible or reckless. Being a young boy was fighting boredom by using your imagination to invent new methods of entertaining yourself. Being a young boy was about pulling pranks, getting into fights, and having fun.\\n\\n\r\nNo young boy or girl talks about an Edgar Allen Poe book that doesn\u2019t exist. \\n\r\nNo young boy or girl jokes about having a friend kill someone. \\n\r\nNo young boy or girl willingly locks someone or allow themselves to be locked in a bus alone for days on end, no matter the circumstance. \\n\\n\r\n\tWhen I finished Erased, there wasn\u2019t that empty feeling you get when you complete a memorable series, that feeling of \u201cNOW what will I do to spend my time?\u201d When I finished Erased, I immediately thought, \u201cShould I write a review for this? Maybe I could use my time for something more productive and worthwhile.\u201d That\u2019s not what I thought when the life-changing experience known as Gurren Lagann came to a close (you know, a CLASSIC title). I was staring at my computer screen with my mouth agape and my eyes watering for what felt like forever (Somehow, I did not cry). As for Erased, I watched it, loved it, stopped loving it, tolerated it, and then it ended. As fast as an eye-roll, Erased has faded from MAL\u2019s Top 10 and from my anime-watching life. In conclusion, this series wasn\u2019t particularly terrible or great. In fact, it was so unmemorable that it will be eventually erased (pun intended) from my memory until its name pops up again one day and I\u2019ll vaguely think, \u201cOh yeah, think I checked that out a while back.\u201d\\n",

            "content": "Boku dake ga Inai Machi (also known as Erased) is a show with all sorts of drama: murdering people for no real reason, generic child abuse by evil parents, and divorce over the alleged theft of a chocolate bar. Sounds engaging, doesn't it?\r\nBut it also has a comedic side, such as romcom blushing, by a guy in his twenties at a ten-year-old no less. And the running gag of \"I said that out loud!\" in every other episode. There is also debate on the merits of secret bases and their inherent manliness.\r\nAnd let's not forget about the murder mystery. There's a killer out there andthe narrative treats his identity as a big mystery, so the show proceeds to... do pretty much nothing with the idea. There is approximately one plausible candidate and narrative causality firmly points to him. The only tension is trying to figure out if he's a red herring because it's way too obvious already.\\n\\n\\n\r\n\"But this show isn't about the killer's identity, it's about other things.\"\\n\\n\r\nThen why does the show make such a big deal out of the killer's identity? Nobody sensible would blame Death Note for revealing the culprit early on because it's very openly a part of the premise, but here it's treated as a legit mystery. And when the time comes to learn the name, it is painted as the Big Reveal.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it's not like the protagonist Satoru is really trying. He does very little to actually identify the culprit, instead spending his time in various elementary school romcom antics in the hopes that this will foil the killer's plans.\\n\\n\r\nYou see, Satoru also happens to be a time traveler with prior knowledge of the victims. How does he make use of this? By trying to continuously protect any and all potential victims. He throws history wildly off its course, making it impossible for him to predict anything. Common sense would suggest letting history unfold and hanging around nearby with binoculars or something. But nope, can't have that.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo if not the killer's identity, what is this show about, then?\\n\\n\r\nMaybe the culprit's motive? Well, don't get too hyped. His motive barely counts as one. He doesn't have any real reason and is basically doing it for the laughs.\\n\\n\r\nNo, I'm pretty sure this show is about elementary school romcom. As stale as it is, the show gets even worse near the end when the romance aspect is put on the sidelines. Because after that there's just nothing left. Other than debating about secret bases, of course. \\n\\n\r\n...You know, this guy is really in his twenties, but after going back in time he acts like a kid anyway. And no, it isn't a cunning facade, he just is that way. One of his classmates comes across as smarter than he does! It doesn't help that most of his classmates are bland and boring to the point I don't really care if they get murdered or not. In a similar burst of creativity, Satoru himself is a generic good guy defined by his desire to help others and has no other personality traits worth mentioning. Aside from liking a ten-year-old girl, of course.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, the plot is a trainwreck both in logic and pacing. The protagonist's time travel powers operate when it's most convenient for the plot as a source of even more cheap drama. The last few episodes are so rushed that they crush whatever little characterization there was, romance included.\\n\\n\\n\r\n\"But the feels!\"\\n\\n\r\nMeh. How am I supposed to find the abuse victim interesting when she is bland, emotionless and barely gets a decent line in the entire thing? Just like the abuser, for that matter. It comes across as a cheap grab for audience sympathy. At least give us some inner thoughts, analysis or commentary, something to think about. The abuse victim in particular desperately needs more lines and especially better lines. Now she's just standing there. The way it's now, it can't set itself apart from the countless other examples of child abuse in fiction. After a while you just grow jaded about these things and can't get \"the feels\" anymore. At least I can't.\\n\\n\r\nAnd don't get me started on the chocolate bar. Nobody would get fired from their job and end up in a divorce because of the alleged theft of one measly chocolate bar. Why would he even need to steal the damn bar? Did they think this guy is a kleptomaniac or something?\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe show also gives protips on how to conduct police investigations or run from the police for that matter:\\n\r\nFind a body? Run from the cops; that will prove you're innocent.\\n\r\nObvious police trap? Walk right in.\\n\\n\r\nThe police arrested a guy with pretty flimsy circumstantial evidence and some leaps of logic. They somehow know the time the victim disappeared more accurately than evidence and testimony suggest. And boots are apparently the new fingerprints.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, get this: if an alleged pedophile kills some girls and one boy, clearly the only logical explanation is that he mistook the boy's gender and thus can't be anyone who knew him well.\\n\\n\r\n...Wait, what?",

Got strong element of feels, a great change of personality, wanting to protect someone, this anime is a great embodiment for slice of life. The feeling of being lonely depicted in this anime feels really familiar to real life. The horror and mystery, either waiting or preventing something bad or good to happen, this anime deliver both of them perfectly. Throughout the show, never once feels lacking.\r\nThe cons.\r\nThe ending might be just right for most viewer, but for me, one piece is still a mystery that the ending justfeels not much of an enclosure, could've used 2 or 3 cuts more to perfect it. The director might just left it as it is, either for a second season, if that's happening, then it would be a really far-stretched story that it's better not being produced at all. Or they just think it's the complete and perfect enclosure, or just follow the original story from novel/manga/game, etc...\\n\\n\r\nConclusion.\\n\r\nThis is a great, if not perfect Slice of Life anime. Definitely A Must Watch.",

            "content": "Few times have I seen an anime so incredibly hyped only to find that it falls into cardiac arrest as the series progresses.  Oh wait, I've seen that plenty of times (Sword Art Online I'm looking at you).  The latest case of this dreadful curse is that of Erased, the winter 2016 series that caught the eye or ear of just about every anime in the otaku universe.  Is Erased overhyped? Yes.  Is Erased bad?  Well, that's all dependent on the individual.  It took an incredibly interesting concept and started off with a bang.  The reception it hasreceived was initially praise-worthy but has diminished to critical reviews and demeaning memes about squandered potential.  I can say that although I am not a fan of the way the plot was handled, I'm not going to change my reviewing standards and give it a 3/10 because that's the thing people are doing.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I say Erased started off strong, I truly mean it.  That first episode is so jam-packed with action that I actually rewatched it several times.  I'll be the first to admit I fell victim to the inadvertent \"bait and switch\" Erased had to offer.  This series introduces a character Satoru Fujinuma who can encounter \"revival\", another word for time travel.  It only occurs randomly, and sets him back several minutes in order to seemingly correct what's out of place.  No one else knows about Satoru's strange ability because he's kind of an unaccomplished loner.  Time travel is always a hairy plot device because since it's not necessarily fact, it's open-endedness births harsh critics who think they know how it's supposed to work.  When I see time travel in shows like this and Steins;Gate I just press the \"I Believe\" button and go with it, as should you.  I did enjoy the nod the writers made to the \"butterfly effect\" phenomena by including the graceful image of a butterfly prior to Satoru entering revival.  As previously mentioned, the first episode is pure gold when it comes to the writing.  I was completely gripped as we watched the underachieving Satoru be thrown into a whirlwind of precarious events which ended in his own mother being killed.  It is at this moment that Satoru's revival takes him all the way back to when he was a ten year old boy.  Only in this case, he's a 29 year old stuck in a ten year old's body.  It is at this point where Satoru begins a roller coaster ride where he tries to protect his mother, his friends and even himself as he's pitted against time travel and the looming threat of the anonymous killer.  Erased had the groundwork to be a fantastic series.  Notice the key word in there, \"had\".\\n\\n\r\nI felt that one of the biggest issues for me in Erased was the pacing.  As many have already pointed out and I will reiterate, the first 5 or so episodes were great.  I though this anime had the possibility of becoming one of my favorites.  There was intricate and delicate care given to the handling of suspense, and many hints to who the killer may be, almost popping up as red herrings.  However, to fully give the background to the characters, I feel this anime should have been expanded to 26 episodes.  Once the killer's identity is uncovered, the pacing is destroyed.  It's almost as though the writers forgot how many episodes they were writing.  The only real backstory you get for the killer is a 2 minute prologue to the second to last episode.  Not to mention the lack of exploration into Kenya's character.  I mean, what kind of ten year old is that smart?  He acted more intelligently than our main protagonist, who was 19 years older than him.  I really wanted Kenya to have more to do with the killer or plot.  \\n\\n\r\nThe second issue I have with Erased is the unrealistic behavior of Satoru when inside his younger self's body.  His actions touch on pedophilia and you don't often hear him inner-monologuing reminding us that he's still 29.  I mean, I'm 27 and some of the decisions he pursued made absolutely zero sense.  The biggest example of this I can think of is when he's laying next to Kayo with his mother in between them and mutters yes when she asks her son if she's in the middle of something.  That's kind of sick, don't you think?  The writers attempted to shroud this by occasionally having him blurt out random things he was thinking.  That has nothing to do with how old he is, but who knows?\\n\\n\r\nWARNING! SPOILERS AHEAD!\\n\\n\r\nThe ending also kind of rubbed me the wrong way.  From what I understand of the manga, seeing Airi is the one thing that makes Satoru's memories come back after he was in a 15 year coma.  In the anime, the tapping of the killers fingers on his wheelchair are what bring them back.  Now although I've never dealt with amnesia firsthand, how the hell do you get every memory back from your previous self in 10 seconds?  That seems so implausible to me.  Not only that, but the killer is set off so easily by Satoru that he almost gets talked into committing double suicide.  At least that type of ending would've been unprecedented.  I knew Airi's presence would've been inserted somewhere in the final episode, as if to say \"yeah I know you wanted to see her more in this show so here's a cocktease of what could have been\".  The ending just felt too rushed and vanilla for me.  Not to mention that Kayo reappears with a kid of her own... with none other than another friend Satoru protected, who everyone else probably thought was a girl.  I've already seen plenty of memes with something to extent of \"when your girl doesn't wait 15 years for you but your pedophile teacher does\".  Now that's some good humor.  \\n\\n\r\nThe character development was low in Erased, partially because of it only being 12 episodes.  I feel so many anime are plagued by this unfortunate drawback and few get it right (Ping Pong, Anohana to name a few).  Satoru was intelligent at times, but at others a dunce.  I just feel that a real 29 year old would've acted differently uncertain situations.  Airi should've been explored more! She ended up being such an important part of the manga, but almost completely neglected in the latter half of the anime.  Same goes for Kenya, this kid must already be a member of MENSA.  Might I add that Sachiko, Satoru's mom is the greatest anime milf of all time?  That bathtub scene though...  The lack of depth and relatability in the killer has already been touched upon, but I can't stress it enough.  He was just another vanilla villain (say that 5 times fast).\\n\\n\r\nThe OP was pretty decent.  It was a nice change of pace from the jpop I'm used to seeing in newer shows.  I also liked how they changed it up to exclude Satoru near the end of the series.  I absolutely loved the ED.  Something about it nailed the aura that the beginning of the show had, with the snowy setting and dark presence.  The rest of the OST was well placed, and the sound effects were some of the best I've heard recently.  On the same token, the art was damn good.  \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, am I happy to see it in the top 20 on MALs top anime list? No, not one bit.  Am I surprised that people also give it 1 or 2 out of 10?  Nope, once the popular opinion of a show declines, everyone becomes a critic.  However, this is why we all have our own lists and ratings.  I am not surprised that it was highly acclaimed based on its first few episodes (another reason why MAL shouldn't allow ratings until the conclusion of a series' current season).  I actually enjoyed the series for what it was, an intense thriller.  Nothing too intellectual can be pondered from its writing, and it was a good time passer.  However, it would've been nice to see more characters explored, and certain elements of the plot handled differently.  It just kind of fell flat for me once the over obvious identity of the killer was revealed.  Anyways, thanks for reading the review and I hope you check out my future works!",

            "content": "ERASED is a suspense/thriller wrapped in a character drama with elements of mystery sprinkled throughout.  That's a mouthful!  But it is this level of complexity that I believe elevates ERASED above a lot of other anime, and Tomohiko Itou really did a marvellous job directing this show into a wonderful adaptation.  Allow me to elaborate.\r\nToo often of late in anime, studios are falling back onto fan-service pandering, questionably aged lolis, and read-the-manga endings to try and push more sales.  Rarely exists a show of a single cour that delivers one complete, self-contained story with an extremely satisfactory ending and with nocheap fan-service to boot!  ERASED delivers just that.  Reading the manga is an option for a bit of a different telling of the story, but isn't mandatory.  These reasons alone are enough to put ERASED above many, many other shows of late, but I'd like to delve through each rating category to see what I think it is that makes the show so compelling!\\n\\n\r\nStory (10/10) - Right out of the gate, the story to ERASED is a fantastic one.  It is a mature, grounded story about a man unhappy with his own life and wanting to resolve past regrets that plague him even to this day.  Fortunately fate grants him that chance via the ability to travel back through time to his older self and relive pieces of his life in an attempt to change the future!  And this is how we begin our story: with our protagonist Satoru having just suffered a terrible loss and immediately sent back to when he was 11 years old, to a time when several girls at his school went missing.  He believes it is his job to save them to right past wrongs and hopefully change his terrible future!  Unfortunately his task is muddled as he doesn't know who the primary culprit is, so he instead races against the clock to try to save the children from their grim fate.  To make matters worse, the main female lead Kayo, one of the targets of this child murderer, is severely abused by her parents making protecting her a rather difficult task.  It is a very human story in the middle of this suspense thriller, and it does a fantastic job connecting you to the characters and pulling at your heart strings.  It makes you care when they are in danger, and really ratchets up the tension in ominous moments.  You get to follow Satoru on this harrowing journey, praying every step of the way that he makes it through.  It builds up to a couple huge and very heartfelt climaxes at the end of the show, and then an extremely satisfying finale that ties up all the loose ends.  It really is a great story that pulls you in, leaving you stressed one moment and ecstatic the next!\\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10) - The art in this show is quite good.  It isn't the best ever, but it is consistently high quality.  I never noticed any severe drops in quality, and there was never a point where anything was unclear to the viewer.  The character designs are quite interesting and a bit different than what I'm used to seeing, especially with some adults like Satoru's mother, Sachiko.  They do a marvellous job of making the children adorable.  The art is also cleverly used to convey a lot of symbolism throughout the show, and you really have to pay attention to notice all the clever details packed into the art/animation!  Colours and contrast are used to the fullest to deliver a subtle messages to the viewer and influence their emotions as necessary.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10) - The sound in this show is also very well done.  There isn't a lot of complexity to it, but the OP/ED are both highly enjoyable to listen to, and the insert tracks throughout the show cue up perfectly at the exact moments required to really punch up the tension of a scene, or melt your heart with joy.  The VA work wasn't the best I've ever heard, but it was quite good.  I also appreciate the newcomer Shinnosuke Mitsushima voicing Satoru in an attempt to make him different and stand out from the rest of the show.  The director was clearly trying to stuff in as much symbolism as he could in ever facet of the show.  Kayo's VA and Sachiko's were both excellent and I enjoyed them every time they were on the screen.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (10/10) - The characters of this show are absolutely fantastic.  The only real negative I can apply to this category is that the villain of the show is a little bit underdeveloped, but the direction they went with said villain is acceptable in my eyes as he is logically motivated and fleshed out enough to make the story interesting.  He doesn't need a deep backstory, as this isn't about the villain, this is a story about the protagonists and their plight.  The rest of the main cast were absolutely fantastic though.  Satoru was convincing as a super-hero wannabe, Kayo was beautifully developed and her unfortunate abuse really hit home for me, and Sachiko has got to win some awards for best mom in anime.  There's also the great supporting cast of all of Satoru's friends that help him along the way that get adequate screen time and do a great job supporting the main cast and letting them grow, while still managing to grow a little bit themselves!  I could connect and relate to a lot of the characters in this, with their thoughts often mirroring my own as I watched, and I absolutely adored Kayo and Airi every time they were on the screen.  One of the easiest 10/10s I could give, the characters were by far the highlight of this show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10) - This show was absolutely one of my favourite things to watch of the 2016 Winter season, and probably one of the most enjoyable shows I've seen to date.  The human element resonated deeply with me, the suspense had me on the edge of my seat, even when I could have sworn I just KNEW the answer, and the ending was tied up absolutely perfectly for my liking.  I got to see people grow, I got to see tragedy, I got to see victory, I got to see a mature story told without pandering fluff.  I adored every second of this show, even in spite some of the minor flaws with it, and I would gladly rewatch this again in the future, preferably with a dub so I can try and catch all the subtle details I missed on the first pass!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nBy now I think you realize I loved ERASED.  It really is a fantastic show.  I think everyone owes it to themselves to watch ERASED at least once, or to at least give it a try before writing it off at face-value.  You may be surprised at how such a simple story can be so engaging.  Like Shirobako, it will be a staple recommendation for me to others.  The characters are just great, and the ending let me walk away with a smile on my face, regardless of the outcomes of all the characters and what was lost, because what was gained was so much more.  Rarely do I get to enjoy such a complete and satisfying experience from an anime, let alone one I think good enough to show to even non-anime fans, but ERASED is definitely one of them.  Props to A-1 for delivering such a fantastic experience, I value every second of it!",

            "content": "A manga artist with a special ability\r\nto go back in time when a death occurs\r\nbecame the victim of a kidnapper's hostility\r\nneeded to make their deaths deferred\r\nSave his mother, and his friends\r\ntravel back to 1988\r\nsolve the mystery; make the amends\r\nhe alone will decide their fate.\r\n\u201cPretending to smile, pretending to worry... I don't think that's a bad thing\u201d - Kayo Hinazuki (ERASED, 2011)\r\nAt last, behold the anime that has climbed its way to the top of the rankings of MyAnimeList within the first few episodes; it comes as surprise to many veterans of anime whom have long searched for a series worthy of becoming the successor toSteins; Gate\u2019s legacy. Boku dake ga Inai Machi, also known as \u201cERASED,\u201d tells the tale of a dark yet heartwarming story that is sure to keep you awake cuddling underneath your blankets.\\n\\n\r\nStory (10/10): ERASED is set near the present in which our main character, 29 year old Satoru Fujinuma possesses a supernatural ability forces him to go back into time, triggering whenever something bad happens. The fact that he is a struggling manga author is hardly relevant to the story at hand but may be explained in detail later. Satoru is involved in an incident which forces him to go back into time, all the way to 1988, where he must solve a murder mystery in order to change the future. He must uncover the details of the murder of a girl in grade school.\\n\\n\r\nThat girl\u2019s name was Kayo Hinazuki.\\n\\n\r\nERASED is noticeably different from Steins; Gate, in the aspect that the former is part of the science fiction genre, while the latter is supernatural. The plot of ERASED is superbly written, and the pacing is perfect, each episode packed full of action and each ending leaving you craving for the next episode. In fact, it\u2019s formatted so perfectly that I almost couldn\u2019t resist reading the manga just to solve the mystery for myself. This anime is shown from Satoru\u2019s point of view, and the balance of active dialogue along with narrative is a perfect mix as well, keeping viewers interested yet not in the dark about our main character\u2019s thought processes. \\n\\n\r\nIn a similar sense Steins; Gate, both plots begin in the same way with a death, which creates a sense of urgency and dread for the viewers. This really allows the people watching this anime to connect with the characters on a much deeper scale. ERASED also deals with other darker issues, including child abuse. This anime is one of the few out there making social commentary on issues most wouldn\u2019t even consider thinking about; it has really enlightened me and made me think more about issues brought up. It is worth mentioning that Satoru's \"Revival\" ability isn't quite explained fully and does tend to gravitate towards being used as a plot device, but this could be overlooked. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter (9/10): In terms of character design, the characters all look very original. The art style and coloring fit the anime\u2019s darker mood as well, and the characters are not so \u201cmoe\u201d that it takes away from the realism aspect. Each character also has many different outfits, as expected from A-1 Pictures. As the setting is a school setting (for the most part), most of the time they are wearing student uniforms, which is expected. The background scenes are very well drawn and animated, as well as the character animation. \\n\\n\r\nMusic (8/10):The soundtrack for the anime is amazing as well. The great variety of BGM empowers each scene, whether it's a sad or a catastrophic scene. Each of the tracks appeals to any number of human emotions and adds to the atmosphere of the story and scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening sequence consists of young Satoru and his friends doing random things at his school. Almost everything is animated and isn\u2019t taken from any scenes from any actual episodes, so A-1 Pictures definitely put in the effort weren\u2019t lazy. Same with the ending. The opening \u201cRe:Re:\u201d by ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION is decent but not something insanely good like \u201cMy Dearest\u201d from Guilty Crown. The ending, \u201cSore wa Chiisana Hikari no Youna,\u201d by Sayuri fits the theme of the anime better and also sounds decent.\\n\\n\r\nVoice Actors (9/10):What really impressed me the most was the voice actors. ERASED features a cast of well-known and experienced actors in the industry as well as two new voice actors making their debut: Mitsushima Shinnosuke and Tsuchiya Tao really impressed me even though it was their first time voice acting for an anime. On the other hand, Taichi You and Takayama Minami, who both possess massive talent and experience were able to bring to life their characters and really make this anime a pleasure to watch and listen to.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter Development (8/10): At the beginning of the anime, even though Satoru has the \"mind of an adult\" and the body of a child, he still thinks he can solve everything himself, which is very childish thinking. However, progressively he learns to trust his friends and work together to find success. Hinazuki also opens up to Satoru more and more as the story progresses. Other than those two characters, there isn't much development for the other characters yet. Will be updated at end.\\n\\n\r\nERASED brings to life a dark and mysterious thriller that will definitely keep you on your toes. It\u2019s execution of the plot is superb and art, animation, characters and music makes it definitely worth watching. Definitely, in my opinion, the best anime of the Winter 2016 season and could even be a top contender for best anime of the 2016 year.",

            "content": "Why I believe so many people were disappointed by Boku Dake ga Inai Machi/ERASED, and why I liked it: Review\r\nWarning: Spoilers ahead\r\nWhen Bokumachi started off, it was quickly hailed as one of the most promising animes of the season. It bravely covered topics like child abuse, kidnapping and time travel; it had a mature and non-generic lead character and seemed to generally target an older audience. Besides, who doesn\u2019t love a good mystery?\r\nI admit that I was a little hesitant about the first episodes. While I admired the show for challenging topics like child abuse and not being afraid to portray a darker take onwhat was, aside from the time traveling, meant to be a pretty realistic story, I did not particularly like its symbolism. Symbolism gets its strength from being subtle, from being discovered rather than being seen. The viewer is meant to be left wondering about the metaphors, interpreting them in his/her/their own way. But Erased was just too obvious with its symbolism, most of the time. We get it, a blue butterfly is meant to hint at the butterfly effect, which is in turn meant to hint at time traveling (seriously how many times have I seen this before?). We get that Hinazuki is abused. We get that she has bruises, you don\u2019t need a black and white scene for me to notice how awful they are. We know Hinazuki\u2019s mom is capable of doing horrible things. We know the teacher is suspicious without his face being covered in shadow. Often, I felt like the series was just throwing everything into my face, assuming I was too slow to notice otherwise. \\n\\n\r\nIt disappointed me a little, because at other times, I thought the series did symbolism magnificently. Like the fact that Satoru\u2019s voice actor was someone with next to no experience (and sounded like it), while the rest of the cast had pretty experienced voice actors. It felt like a little nod at the show\u2019s title - The Town Where Only I am Missing. Or the red eyes, which were not only noticeable among the antagonists, but also among protagonists, like Satoru and Kenya. Why were Kenya\u2019s eyes red when he was talking to the teacher? We don\u2019t know for sure, and that\u2019s what symbolism is all about: creating your own hypotheses.\\n\\n\r\nStill, I really enjoyed watching this show. I think a lot of people were left disappointed because they had expectations that the show never intended to meet. It took me a couple of episodes to realize this. When I started watching, I was really excited about figuring out who the culprit was. I love a good whodunit, and I already had a list of suspects from the first episode on. However, it quickly became clear to me that this show did not want to be a whodunit. I began to wonder why the series wasn\u2019t making the teacher less suspicious. In a kidnapping/child murder mystery, the teacher is often the culprit. There is no way the creators weren\u2019t aware of that. That\u2019s when I realized the show was not trying to hide the fact that the teacher was suspicious. Quite the opposite: they wanted us to find out who the culprit was, as soon as possible. His eyes would be red, his face would be hidden in shadows, he would look at the kids in a certain way, and the person who killed Satoru\u2019s mom did not fit any other profile than the teacher\u2019s. Because what the show was truly about, was not finding out who was the culprit. \\n\\n\r\nI may be wrong, but I believe this series, through all of its chaotic plots twists, from time traveling to child abuse to homicide to police investigations, was trying to give us an underlying message. Throughout all of the episodes, you have to keep the title in mind. I\u2019ll repeat it for you: \u201cThe Town Where Only I am missing.\u201d Satoru never really fit in, no matter which time arc he traveled to. In his own time, Satoru had been a failed manga artist, trying to make some extra cash by delivering pizza. He had next to no friends or interests, or memories he cherished. When he traveled back in time, he obviously did not fit in, with his 29 year mind in a 10 year old\u2019s body. His friends, especially the clever ones like Kenya, were quick to catch up on this. Satoru himself noticed too that he was out of place, like when he experienced feelings of caring for Hinazuki (in a purely friendly way, I believe) which just didn\u2019t seem right for a 29 year old man to have. Back in his own time arc, he was suspected of being a criminal. In this arc too, people didn\u2019t really know him for who he really was. Where could he fit in? Which arc would make him the happiest? It was clear that Satoru had to create a town in which he would belong. And the only way to do that, was to bond with others. \\n\r\nIf I were to summarize the series\u2019 message, it would be something like \u201cA hero is not just one person; it\u2019s multiple people working together.\u201d Because what would Satoru have been able to do without his mom\u2019s bold intuition? Or without Kenya\u2019s cleverness? Or Hiro\u2019s ability to notice people who didn\u2019t fit in? \\n\r\nThat brings me to another subject I loved about this show. The show made a point about how \u201cthe weak\u201d ones are the most likely targets of people with bad intentions. But weak does not always mean weak in a stereotypical way. Weak here meant: those who are alone, those who don\u2019t have anyone else standing up for them, those who cannot talk to anyone else, those who come home to an empty house. The way Satoru and his friends defeated the teacher, was not through any sly method. It was through the best way a 10 year old kid could do things: by befriending whoever was alone. I really, sincerely loved that message. \\n\\n\r\nI\u2019d like to end this with a last point that I loved about this show. When I said that Satoru did not fit in in any time arc, I wasn\u2019t exactly right. If you\u2019ve watched the show, you may have noticed that there is one thread that is represented in every time arc: Satoru\u2019s mom. She is, in my opinion, the single most important character in the series. When Satoru would come across as \u201c a different person\u201d to his friends or to Hinazuki, when he would even lose touch with his own identity - being a 29 year old in a 10 year old body- his mom would remind him that he was still her son. No matter which time arc he was in, his mom would always accept him for who he was. She knew him through and through. He was his mom\u2019s son, no matter where he went, and that helped to keep his sense of identity. This was beautifully exemplified when, when Satoru truly went missing from his town - by being in a coma for years-  his mom kept taking care of him, as if he wasn\u2019t missing, but had been there all the time. \\n\r\n(Yeah I have a lot of feelings about Satoru\u2019s mom.) \\n\\n\r\nSo, in hindsight, I thought this was a really heart-warming anime that I enjoyed watching. A little pretentious by the end, not always as deep as it wanted to be (like Airi\u2019s disappointing lack of character depth) and maybe with a few plot holes and unanswered questions (I still wonder why Hiro was targeted since he was a boy\u2026 was he just an alibi for the teacher?).\\n\r\nBut I will forgive those things, because it did have some unique, beautiful moments. I would still recommend it to others. \\n\r\nThere is, however, not a doubt in my mind that the manga is better. I think I will read it. \\n",

            "content": "Time travel isn't anything new to anime. We've seen it done again, and again, and again. Sure, some stories really throw a curveball into a mind-blowing plot, while others bite the dust of overused concepts. Every single episode of Erased is a cliff hanger. You want to know what's going to happen next every single time. It isn't your typical \"better go back in time and save some friends\" story. It really has it's own personal twist on it. The characters are easy to fall for, the main characters especially over the lesser important ones. While there's little relationship between Satoru and the 2 differentgirls that the viewers would like to ship them with, the story is really heartwarming and mature. There are many different layers to it. When you think you've figured out what will happen next, you're thrown in a completely different direction. The art for the most part is really enjoyable, and the sound is clear. This is a fantastic anime that I'd recommend to anyone looking for a new favorite. I don't see why the reviews are so mixed between low and high, but this definitely gets a 10 on my list. The few nitty gritty details don't knock it down to a 9.",

            "content": "EraseD SUCKS!!!!!!!!11!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!111!111111!!1!1/10 thanks for reading my re:review\r\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \r\nare they gone yet\u2026?\r\nThe Town Where Only I Am Missing (the name that actually has context) is actually a great anime in several places, so much that it partially makes up for the places where it isn\u2019t great. Partially. Its biggest strengths lie in its \u201cshow, not tell\u201d approach and emotional storytelling, but things start to go south when the story has completed its main arc and needs to shift gears. The first eight episodes would be a solid 8-9/10 with the last four being about a 5-6/10. Ultimately, it doesn\u2019t handle its supernatural and(arguably) mystery elements very well, so if those are what drew you here, you\u2019re gonna have a bad time.\\n\\n\r\nThe star of the show is Fujinuma Satoru, an incredibly deadbeat 29-year-old pizza driver with no friends and only one hobby that he sucks at, so he\u2019s good as far as being a character for the audience to project themselves to goes. He has a supernatural ability called \u2018butterfly;effect\u2019, officially named \u201cRevival\u201d, where time jumps back a few moments and only he remembers, and this apparently happens whenever something bad happens and it\u2019s somehow his job to save it, \u2018cuz why not. But when the only person close to him is murdered and he\u2019s framed as the suspect, he has a massive Revival that sets his life eighteen years back, just before the start of a kidnapping series that an old friend was wrongly convicted for.\\n\\n\r\nAnd thus, the emotional rollercoaster begins. But, you know how rollercoasters work, right? They usually start off slow so they can build up enough height for the drops to actually work. Erased starts off pretty slow, and I\u2019ll admit that it took me a couple episodes to be interested beyond the level of \u201cWhat\u2019s gonna happen from here?\u201d But episode three was incredible for its intense drama and tear-jerking finale. I mean, I may be a misanthropic basement-dweller with no ambitions whatsoever, but for fuck\u2019s sake, I still have feelings, you know? Erased, with its big emotional moments, wipes away all that hate for some time and makes me not want the 10-year-olds to get brutally sawed in half by a rake. Except that one girl from the lunch money incident. Yo, fuck that kid. No pedo.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, where was I? Oh yeah, the good writing.\\n\\n\r\nErased has a great way of showing us what we need to know, instead of just telling us. Instead of saying \u201cKayo is abused, feel bad!\u201d we see it, but without getting gratuitous about it. Instead of hearing \u201cThis is making a big difference on Kayo\u2019s life!\u201d we see her responses and recognize the changes ourselves. Little things like these are what I appreciate, but it doesn\u2019t feel too subtle and doesn\u2019t require you to think hard about what\u2019s going on. We see everything we need to know at just the right amount. ...Except for the things that aren\u2019t shown at all, but we\u2019ll get into that. \\n\\n\r\nSo, what else did I like? Well, Satoru and Kayo, the two main characters, have great chemistry together that starts off a little awkward, \u2018cuz Kayo\u2019s like some socially inept punching bag and Satoru is a 29-year-old stuck inside a 10-year-old\u2019s body. No pedo. But as Satoru makes it his life\u2019s goal to protect Kayo (because Pokemon didn\u2019t exist in 1988, what a harsh world), he grows attached to her and Kayo opens up to him and to those around her. It\u2019s taken a little further because 29-year-old Satoru surprises himself as he occasionally says things in the moment, perhaps being more like his 10-year-old self instead.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the story is pretty good, but it falls apart after about eight episodes. The arc comes to a close, but there\u2019s still a lot of ground to cover, and it\u2019s clear that it needed to hurry in order to squeeze everything in the 12-episode limitation. What made this anime so good from the beginning were its incredible character moments, but daddy\u2019s love is gone after the main arc is completed, as it\u2019s clear that not much effort was put into the characters and plot that came afterwards. We get the new kid and a small plot to save them and not a single fuck was given that day. Anyone wanna go play Dragon Quest?\\n\\n\r\nDuring these last episodes, the killer is finally revealed. Except it\u2019s like the most obvious reveal ever. Like, if you didn\u2019t figure it out at least an episode before then\u2026 you\u2026 might be\u2026 re\u2026\u2026spected as a normal human being who simply processes things differently than me. The thing is, this was kinda labeled as a mystery series, but there wasn\u2019t really any mystery. It\u2019s disappointing because there\u2019s another character that actually seemed sketchy to me. In the short time we see him, I thought that, just maybe, it wasn\u2019t gonna be what ended up being the totally obvious. Unfortunately, they chose not to go down that avenue, and so we only get one legitimate suspect. You can\u2019t play Clue with one character. However, all that being the case, I did actually enjoy the eventual reveal. I thought that, even if the show didn\u2019t really try to hide it, they made this big bang pretty interesting.\\n\\n\r\nWhile this certain villain is an interesting one, their motives were just\u2026 confusing. Something about a short story and seeing themself and their actions as the character to this story, something like that\u2026 Well, I did understand the concept, anyway, but like, WHY? Why are this person\u2019s actions being driven by some made-up tale for children? It\u2019s incredibly vague. I couldn\u2019t connect with it.\\n\\n\r\nSomething also happens along with the villain\u2019s reveal. It\u2019s a spoiler so I won\u2019t say what it is, but there\u2019s no explanation of how it was resolved at all. It happens, and we\u2019re just forced to accept the result even though there\u2019s nothing in between to make sense of it. You\u2019ll know it when you get to it.\\n\\n\r\nThe last thing that bothered me was Revival, Satoru\u2019s time-travelling ability. It is NEVER explained how this works. Whenever I say these sorts of things, people say \u201coh fenne-kun~, yer so cynical, it\u2019s like, totally beyond our knowledge, y\u2019know??? it\u2019s like God, it can\u2019t be explained main, just accept it!!\u201d Yeah, but here\u2019s the thing. God is still defined to some extent and affects many people. You can\u2019t just allow a supernatural phenomenon to affect one single person and expect everyone to go with it. That\u2019s bullshit. Revival affects Satoru only (idc if this will later be given to someone else through the upcoming spin-off or whatever, what matters are these twelve episodes that are supposed to tell a complete story) and goes away when the story is over. The entire plot literally depends on Revival, because without Revival then Satoru wouldn\u2019t go back to 1988, he\u2019d still be a boring pizza guy who makes shit manga, and we wouldn\u2019t have the story itself. It\u2019s too important to shrug off.\\n\\n\r\nNow, Revival doesn\u2019t exactly have to be explained. I CAN interpret it as something that transcends our world and our knowledge of it. But, if anything, the villain should\u2019ve had the same ability. SOMEONE should\u2019ve had the same ability. This should not have been excluded to Satoru only, it is way too convenient. I like to compare and contrast Revival with The Force from Star Wars. It\u2019s not explained (phantom menace literally does not exist), but it\u2019s there, and many people (or\u2026 things) have it. It\u2019s incredibly surreal and mysterious, but it\u2019s central to the series\u2019 lore. Something like that would\u2019ve been a good inspiration for Erased.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character is a bit of a controversial one. Satoru is, again, a 29-year-old now who spends most of the show trapped inside a 10-year-old\u2019s body. No pedo. And so, his personalities conflict with one another and get confusing. The moments when his 29-year-old mind will ask himself questions are the best, but they\u2019re too infrequent. It\u2019s good that he has a little self-awareness, it\u2019s just that he doesn\u2019t have enough self-awareness. It\u2019s like his first day on the job as a color commentator for a sport he knows nothing about. But, looking back, his dual personalities were the only interesting thing about him. Look at either of them individually and see that there\u2019s not much to look at in the first place. But\u2026 is that so wrong? Really? I won\u2019t defend him as an interesting character, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s totally fair to judge a deadbeat 29-year-old loser for being a 29-year-old loser, or for thinking an ordinary 10-year-old kid is an ordinary 10-year-old kid.\\n\\n\r\nKayo, on the other hand, has a much more defined personality due to her bitchy mother being a bitch to her. She\u2019s closed off and even cold to others, but she opens and warms up to not only Satoru, but anyone else around her as she finally learns how to live. You see a really positive and satisfying change to her. No pedo. Beyond development, the character herself is interesting anyway, since she\u2019s much more thoughtful and will sometimes say some interesting things, like her characteristic \u201cAre you stupid?\u201d. \\n\\n\r\nThere are two supporting characters all fulfill their roles greatly. Kenya is one of Satoru\u2019s classmates. He\u2019s mature and intelligent for his age and is not only helpful to Satoru, but can detect that something is wrong. Not what is wrong, just that something is, and it\u2019s probably beyond him. He knows his place. Good kid. No pedo. Sachiko, Satoru\u2019s mom, not only has some hot MILF lips, but is well-written in just a couple simple ways. She gets killed, right? But instead of hyping her up to be truly deserving of a coffee mug that says \u201cWORLD\u2019S BEST MOM\u201d, she\u2019s killed instantly without us getting to know her, but they later build her character up to be very likable so that we hope Satoru succeeds in reversing the future killings. Also, she\u2019s just a good motherly character, which is important in the context of Erased, where one of the biggest plot threads involves Kayo getting abused by her mother. She\u2019s basically the foil to this antagonist. Or\u2026 it\u2019s the other way around\u2026 i failed ap english okay\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s also Airi, a supporting character in the present time\u2026 While she had some real p-u-n-c-h at times, I thought she was a little too convenient? Like, she only showed up when the story absolutely needed someone to help Satoru out. Maybe that\u2019s just me, but I didn\u2019t really care for her. She at least had her reasons, though. Don\u2019t steal chocolate bars, kids.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some other characters, of course, namely Satoru\u2019s other friends, but they\u2019re not needed so their lack of depth is okay. They\u2019re just along for the ride.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP of Erased is actually really, really good. I didn\u2019t care for it much at first, but it grew on me quickly, and I think I\u2019ll be getting into the band Asian Kung-Fu Generation soon. The song has a very moderate-paced alternative rock sound characterized by some highs and lows after the first verse. The lack of any electronic or string accompaniment makes it feel more natural, and in a way, more human. It\u2019s pretty fitting to the theme of the anime, and the animation supporting it is nothing short of acceptable. The ED holds its own as well with its gentle, but heartfelt feel that later ascends into a powerful, grand song about\u2026 whatever. I don\u2019t actually know what it\u2019s about. Whoops. Anyway, while I was never crazy for this theme, the full version played over the last episode was absolutely stunning. Shut up, kid, lemme play my air guitar.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the soundtrack ranges from decent to good; it\u2019s evidently an emotional one and sets the tone very well, but it has a tendency to reuse certain pieces a little too often. The voice acting is nothing special, but it gets the job done; many characters sound casual, as they should. Satoru himself has an incredibly deadbeat voice, and sometimes I think it\u2019s a little TOO monotonous; I get that he\u2019s a boring dude, but for fuck\u2019s sake, man, lighten up a little. You\u2019re a kid again. Everyone else is okay.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, Erased is a bit of an oddity for its wide, theatrical aspect ratio during its time in the 80\u2019s. For modern scenes, you\u2019re getting a typical ratio. This was a good move and somehow added to the drama of the past. It also contains some pretty good camera shots and not-so-subtle symbolism which aren\u2019t groundbreaking by any means, but are also welcome additions. The art itself is pleasant with some good, but also casual environments complemented by some good lighting and some passable character designs that probably won\u2019t stand out on their own through time, but this isn\u2019t supposed to be some wild, crazy fantasy. One common complaint is that A-1 Pictures makes extremely similar-looking characters in most of their anime, but Erased is an exception to this. Congrats, you guys. You actually did something right for about two seconds, and then Grimgar happened. But that\u2019s for another review...\\n\\n\r\nAll this said, I enjoyed Erased for the most part. I don\u2019t want the final four episodes to completely muddy the excitement of the first eight. (That includes the chocolate bar incident. Yes, I am okay with that story. It seems perfectly plausible to me.) I even felt\u2026 a little content with the overall ending. It wasn\u2019t horrible, even if the events leading up to it were rushed. But the ending was at least mostly satisfying. No pedo.\\n\\n\r\nErased is simply a good show with some really noticeable bruises. Just like Kayo. \\n\\n\r\nStory - 6/10\\n\r\nArt - 9/10\\n\r\nSound - 7/10\\n\r\nCharacters - 7/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7/10\\n\r\nFeels - Needsmorekayo/10\\n\r\nOverall - 7/10\\n\r\nFavorite character - Kayo\\n\r\nFavorite episode - 8\\n\r\nRecommendation level - Medium",

            "content": "ERASED is the most tragic kind of failure to witness. To put it simply, it is an anime full of ideas that it doesn\u2019t know how to use. Forging an engaging premise with many mysteries that are yet to unfold, the ideas it had initially presented are suddenly shoved under the rug, only to be pulled back out when convenient, as if they were nothing more than a mere afterthought. And so without the support it needs, the story loses its way and tumbles down into an abyss of mediocrity. There is nothing more saddening to me than the failure of something that could havebeen excellent if handled some other way.\\n\\n\r\nFor a show that comes off as a mystery anime, not much mystery is to be found here. After such a meticulous build up to what would be an exciting murder mystery thriller full of mind games and plot twists, ERASED doesn\u2019t make good use of this. The show suddenly shifts its main focus from the murder mystery tale onto how Satoru will get Kayo rescued, and stays that way throughout the majority of the show, leaving all other aspects of the plot underdeveloped and unexplored. With the amount of mysteries from the beginning, little to no progress is made from there. Satoru rarely considers coming closer to the mystery or making any kind of plan, for he is unable to get Kayo off of his mind. He doesn\u2019t come in contact with any of the suspected individuals nor does he suspect anything along the way. In the end, Satoru confronts the killer through nothing but convenience, making the payoff measly at best. I never felt involved in the mystery up to this point and I was given little to think about. To make matters worse, the identity of the killer is so thinly veiled it\u2019s downright insulting. If you think you\u2019ve guessed the identity of the killer by the third episode, trust me, you guessed correctly. And the show continues to make it more and more obvious to the point where you might as well ditch the mystery entirely. This kind of thing would have worked if the show was intending to mislead the viewer through this method, but assuming this was the case would be giving the writer and the director too much credit.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now on to the time traveling aspect. Time travel has always been a risky choice when it come to writing stories, due to how difficult it can be to handle. But nonetheless, the \u201cRevival\u201d power beheld by Satoru is an interesting story element that makes way for possibilities. Sadly, this power turns out to be little more than a convenient way of getting Satoru in and out of certain situations, and is neither experimented with nor fleshed out beyond that. In writing, any consequences spawned from the use of time travel is the least of the show\u2019s concern when ERASED doesn\u2019t even bother to take any kind of risk with it. On top of this, the rules on how it operates are unclear, and it only seems to activate whenever convenient for the plot. At first it activates when a tragedy occurs, but then it activates based on Satoru\u2019s emotions. Not only does this create more holes than a colander, it eliminates any kind of tension taking place in the story, which is the biggest kick in the nuts for a thriller. Without the necessary knowledge for any possible outcome, I\u2019m unable to feel any kind of investment. The Revival power is yet another aspect with could have delivered if only the story knew what the hell it was doing.\\n\\n\r\nThere are plenty more elements of the story that the show refuses to take advantage of. Jun Shiratori is a close friend of Satoru\u2019s who was falsely suspected prior to the main plot, and yet we don\u2019t ever hear of him again. We are given info on Satoru\u2019s career as a mangaka, and yet it contributes absolutely nothing to the plot. The core plot of ERASED feels so disconnected from the initial premise, that it might as well be only written as a simple story of a child\u2019s mission to rescue his abused classmate. Satoru doesn\u2019t act like a 29-year-old as he should, the Revival power has little involvement in this plot, there is nothing thought provoking about the mystery, and numerous other elements stick out like a sore thumb.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot with Kayo Hinazuki wouldn\u2019t be as much of an issue if it held some merit to warrant being the main focus. But this sadly isn\u2019t the case. Kayo is not a bad character, but she isn\u2019t a very interesting one either. She is little more than an ordinary child who suffers from abuse, and is yet to be murdered. Her development is scarce throughout the story. For these reasons, this particular plot would be better off being little more than a few episodes long, which would also clear some room for the mystery and the Revival power to be tampered with. In addition, her parental abuse gets an unnecessary amount of focus, in spite of how insubstantial it really is. Kayo has no psychological struggle we can relate to other than simply needing friends. ERASED fails to realize that the negative effects of parental abuse extend far beyond being lonesome. When a subject such as child abuse gets as much focus as it gets here, I expect it to be fleshed a whole lot more than a mere concept of emotional appeal.\\n\\n\r\nTo make matters worse, Satoru is incompetent as hell when it comes to protecting someone, let alone solving mysteries. He never plans things out, and instead dives headfirst into any situation in front of him, never thinking about anything that might go wrong. Why not take a picture of the evidence of Kayo\u2019s abuse when you see it? Why not put a lock the RV you're keeping her in? Why does he try to perform a sneak attack on Kayo\u2019s mother instead of...I dunno...spying on her? Disregarding how bland of a character Satoru is, it\u2019s difficult for me to root for him when he doesn\u2019t even have the thought process of a human being.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning that ERASED tries its darndest to have empathy given to any character, whether they be an ally, or a villain. Even the most heinous acts, whether they be child abuse or a murdering spree, is given a motive to show that these characters were actually good people who just did some bad things. But little insight is given to their psychology or their character, and so I remain disconnected, and unable to believe these backstories contribute to any theme or story element other than superficial empathy from the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nERASED does have strengths. As little meaning as the interactions between Satoru and Kayo hold, they are certainly entertaining to watch. With Satoru being timid and Kayo being composed and dominant, the moments between these characters are most certainly the strongest aspect of ERASED. It gives some life to the story and as such is the main selling point of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of characters in ERASED ranges from being a mixed bag to forgettable overall. Satoru\u2019s introverted nature serves little to the story and his personality isn\u2019t fleshed out beyond a simple good-moraled hero. And yet again, it\u2019s a damn shame his career as a mangaka turned out pointless. Kayo is little more than a plot device whose arc is unworthy of having so much time spent on. The cheerful personality of Anri perhaps serves as a light in Satoru\u2019s dark night sky, so to speak. Too bad that her involvement in the plot or effect on Satoru\u2019s character is minimal. Satoru\u2019s mother is the bomb. She is easily likeable due to having a sense of ration along with her being sincere and practical, as well as being an awesome mother. She is a good character, even if she doesn\u2019t really develop. Every other character is either defined by only their struggles, or is just a blank slate. While some are entertaining on a surface level, pretty much all of them are as bland as a rice cracker in terms of character dimensions. Drama is forged through victimizing rather than actual relatable, human struggles.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the visual aspect, it\u2019s rather hit-or-miss. Not necessarily in terms of how it looks, but by how it conveys things. It\u2019s generally a good-looking show overall. The backgrounds are rather lovely and the animation is fluid enough. The character designs, although generic, are very appealing and are well-fit for the characters\u2019 personalities. The directing, however, is handled like a child. Suspenseful and emotional moments are so ham-fisted and over-the-top it\u2019s almost laughable. When I have pretty much gotten the point of what a scene is trying to convey, the directing then takes extra steps to make full certainty that I understand, which only serves to hurt more than help. An example is how inhumanly spastic Kayo\u2019s abusive mother behaves. As far as I\u2019m concerned this isn\u2019t how abusive parents really act. The directing also overuses stylization with its use of color and obvious symbolism, which is often borderline immersion-breaking. Any character with a feeling of malicious intent will be given red eyes, because apparently the viewers are too incompetent to get the point otherwise. On the other hand, the 1988 sequences are given a nice atmosphere to them, making it easy to feel involved in each scene. So while the director seems to be headed in the right direction, he has not proven to be skillful enough based on what we find here.\\n\\n\r\nERASED is not a bad show. It has its moments, and some deal of entertainment can be found. But the end result of what it was initially hyped up to be is nothing short of a disappointment. With no idea of what it wants to be, clumping numerous underdeveloped plot elements together, along with irrational behavior of the characters, and what we\u2019re left with is a Frankenstein\u2019s monster of a storyline. It is easy to say that the premise of ERASED had overpowered the writing, and would have turned out better if it had been handled by a different author entirely.",

            "content": "I get it, hater guys, you pass your time on TV Tropes, then you come here and recognize tropes at us. But come on, poking fun at a work while being totally unfunny? Criticizing the writing and pace of the story when you're unable to keep me interested in your review for more than 30 seconds? Lame. But this enables me to be sassy, and I'm grateful for that.\r\nAs usual, I'll admit being the exact inverse of an expert in any of the fields touched by this, or any other, anime. I like most anime because I don't know where they fail miserably. So Igive Erased his thumb up with no hesitation and no shame.\\n\r\nErased was on my watching list since forever. It was there because somebody recommended it. It's been there forever because hey what am I doing revealing my secret life to strangers on MAL? Stop it, me.\\n\\n\r\nSatoru is a manga artist. He has an editor, so he must not be the failure a few guys here try to depict. I guess \"mangaka\" is a step down from \"MAL reviewer\" in some people's mind.\\n\r\nHe's got SERIOUS d\u00e9j\u00e0-vu syndrome, and memories he doesn't want to revisit. Until he's forced not only to revisit, but to relive his youth in order to save the world, or at least a small part of it. Which makes him save himself, in a way. Don't we all dream of going back and do that one thing, say that one word which would have changed our life? Unless you have no back to go to, obviously: if you're, say, 18, THIS is the moment to say that word, to do that thing. Mark my words: no matter how fully you live your life, you'll have A LOT to regret when you're 50.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway. Of course that extra action carries an heavy weight, and opens a completely new can of worms, and not everything goes like it should, and there will be other extra actions to do. Hilarity, but mostly angst and distress, ensue. This series has funny moments, heartwarming moments, wtf moments, and a couple moments where you can see the pixels. There, I said it.\\n\r\nBut seriously, one thing: I don't know how smart are kids nowadays, but I don't remember 10 years old children being that mature, and adults being that supportive of kids. It's something that I see often in anime: high schoolers completely ignored by the grown-ups, or small children treated with respect and given responsibilities. Must be one of those \"tropes\" everybody talks about. \\n\r\nOh, and the author seems to actually write the story as he sees fit instead of relying on the wisdom of internet experts. This makes for a great story, as opposed to a boring documentary.\\n\r\nYes, as with every fantasy story out there, Erased asks for the so-called \"suspension of disbelief\". If you are unable to suspend your disbelief for 23 minutes, you shouldn't watch TV, not even the news.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Story: is it unoriginal? I don't know, it never occurred to me to have to time travel to save people. I wish (it would make me Okarin, which isn't a bad thing, mind you). Great story. 9/10\\n\r\n\u2022 Art: the lips. Adult women have funny lips, then they go back to regular lips in the old age. Uhm. The art is good bordering on very good, but I guess no anime nowadays has actual bad art or animation. I'm looking at you, Virtual-san. 7/10\\n\r\n\u2022 Sound. Did I say I'm no expert at anything? Well, I'm a little picky when it comes to sound. Here I was probably distracted by the (unoriginal) story or by the (terrible) art, because I didn't notice any bad audio. It's easy to go overboard in a mystery setup, with lots of tah-dahs and ka-zams and ooooohms. I'm not displeased, so it's an 8/10\\n\r\n\u2022 Characters: very, very relatable people in here. I am the mother, but I am the manager too, and Airi, and Kenya (what?) and obviously Satoru. I am NOT Kayo's mother and most of all I am NOT the murderer. Murdering people should be done with a grain of salt. Great characters. 9/10\\n\r\n\u2022 Enjoyment: one day I actually couldn't wait to come back home and see the next episode, so I watched it on the computer in my office while pretending to get stuff done. It's that good. 9/10\\n\r\n\u2022 Overall, an 8/10, but it could well be a 9. Let's settle on 8.5, see how normal I am?\\n\\n\r\nBut I shipped Satoru and Kayo, and they sunk my ship. Aw, come on.\\n\r\nHey, welcome back, Airi. Shouldn't you be, like, 15 now? Never mind suspended, my disbelief is currently dead.",

            "content": "Alright, well this is gonna have a lot to cover since I feel this anime, Boku dake ga Inai Machi, did SOOO MUCH right and left me feeling like it could never be duplicated or repeated by any other creator. Lets start with the first episode that was released thirteen weeks ago; It was just... just.... GAHHHHHHHHHH! There was so much to say! It starts the story with the MC, Satoru Fujinuma, living a deadbeat life, no friends, no success, trying to become a manga artist and working at a pizza shop to cover his living expenses. Except he has a power. As the name,Revival, says, he\u2019s able to go back to a time where some awful predicament is going to happen and make changes to fix it. I know right? Pretty hard to get the feels with. Suddenly, after some pretty unbelievable turn of events that make you rip your hair out, Satoru suddenly finds himself in 1988! Back in his 11 year old body to change his past! AND THAT WAS JUST EPISODE 1!\\n\\n\r\nSo I'm gonna hit the sounds first because I think it was a VERY heavy influence on the outcome of this anime. Both the intro and outro were awesome, but sadly I skipped them for the amazing anime. The bgm was perfect, you never knew it was there because it fit so well, never overtaking the animation, with its surroundings and made you feel that things were going to happen without realizing that you knew things were going to happen because you were still so focused on the anime! The voice actors are my favorite. I wracked my brain around EVERY time I heard the MC's voice because I could NOT for the life of me figure out who the actor was. Well turns out that this is the voice actor's first role and he slayed it like a monster. I can't wait to hear him play more characters. The voices used for the other characters I think were very well done as well, as every voice resonated with the character's personality and there was no contradiction between them.\\n\\n\r\nGetting back into my normal pace, let\u2019s hit the story second. Unique, engulfing, and heart-tearing are the first three words that I feel for this anime. I don't think I've ever watched an anime or read a manga where the story forces the MC to live his present life and his past life back and forth the way this anime did. The need... no, the DESIRE to want this character to succeed is ridiculous! Just outright, you feel that everything this character does is just beyond human and that he has to have a good ending! It just pulls when it wants to pull and there is no way for you to feel anything but what the anime wants you to feel. And the cliff hangers! They were too good! Unbelievably good!\\n\\n\r\nNow hitting the art, I think it was nothing really impressive. In fact certain character's faces made me cringe and wish I could ask for them to be remade, but it\u2019s okay because I really liked the way the art looked for the actually important characters, likes the kids the story focused on. I did really enjoy the use of the 3D panning during key situations of the anime. All in all though, I don't really think the animation had much to cover, as it really didn't stand out as anything amazing.\\n\\n\r\nNormally an anime without any character development would've upset me and cause me to give it a bad review right there, but Boku dake ga Inai Machi did very well giving ONLY the three most important characters' backgrounds, but even then, we really know almost nothing about any of the characters. Its an insignificant detail but I feel like they could've made this anime a little longer, maybe a 13 episode, just to but in a little more detail for certain characters instead of just making them extremely important but not letting us know why they cared about the MC so much. Clearly the Mother's reasoning was obvious but the really questions is why Kenya went as far as he did to make sure the MC had his justice. There just did not seem to be any reason other than making it convenient to the anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I thoroughly thought this anime was extremely well made and had a lot doing it justice. My feeling for the MC during the whole anime just never quit wanting to make sure he hit that goal of finding the killer and the reason that these outrageous events were unfolding. This anime will become a favorite of mine for sure; it just had so many key aspects that I always look for in anime. Just so much of it clearly stood out above the rest, and no matter how heavy or soft the cliff hanger was, you always felt a desire for more, it was just THERE. Like an undying thirst of a zombie, you just wanted it without a reason to feel so invigorated! I rated this anime a 10/10 because, while I had some issues with the art and characters, I feel it was just too greatly executed to not get a 10. I hope everyone can enjoy this anime and this new voice actor!!\\n",

            "content": "A Modern Masterpiece, Despite What the Mob Says\r\nI recently watched this series without much background outside the synopsis and MAL score. And when I finished, I felt I had watched something truly special. Unbeknownst to me, it seems the anime community had turned on the show. It left me scratching my head. What was I missing? \r\nAt one point, Erased was in the top 5 on MAL, and now a giant portion of the community legitimately disdains it, to the point where 3 of the 4 top reviews are 5 or below. Was the ending that poor? This caused me to really reflect on whatI had watched, and yet I still couldn't see merit to the backlash. Was the ending a little rushed? Sure. That's the case for most 1 cour shows. Are people just angry that a certain ship did not sail? Seems petty to me, but ok. \\n\\n\r\nThis seems to be a case \"group think\" or \"mob mentality\". At some point, someone decided the ending was so bad it ruined the show, and everyone just sort of jumped on this bandwagon. Well, I'm going to tell you why you should jump off.\\n\\n\r\nI'm someone with a pretty short attention span. Oftentimes, I find myself browsing my phone while watching anime or anything else. So it speaks volumes that I literally could not take my eyes off Erased. It is one of the few shows to hook me from the start, and never let go. The characters, the story, the plot twists, the cliff-hangers. It was all consistently compelling. I don't want to spoil the story, and you can read the synopsis, so I'll move onto the characters.\\n\\n\r\nWith the main character Satoru, you had the under-achieving, and frankly, unremarkable, 29 year old pizza delivery man, whom was given the \"gift\" of revival. This power to go back in time and help those that need help. What strikes me about Satoru was not his life-saving tendencies, but how the course of the story affected him and eventually ignited change within him. In a way, revival gave new life to a person who at best lived a \"stale\" life. It some of the best character development from a 12 episode anime I've seen.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the other characters go, I have to give a shout out to Satoru's mom, Sachiko, who has to be in the running for anime mom of the decade. She manages to be both caring and honest with Satoru, without being at all overbearing. She carries the immense responsibility of being a single mother with utmost grace and humility. And plus she is just such a cool lady, I feel like she steals most scenes she appears in. Sachiko is my favorite character in this show.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then there is Kayo, the classmate whom Satoru realizes doesn't only need saving from her eventual murderer. Now, a lot has been said abut Kayo and her relationship with Satoru, particularly pertaining to the last couple episodes. I'm not going to spoil anything, but I will say I enjoyed watching their relationship develop, and she quickly became a character whom you really wished happiness for. Amongst the horrors of her life, there was some legitimately heart-warming moment sprinkled in. I feel she added a great deal to the show in terms of pure human moments. \\n\\n\r\nSo the story and characters were great. What about the rest? The art was above average, but nothing spectacular. It didn't really have a unique style like Shaft or Kyoto, but A-1 certainly didn't drop the ball by any means. The voice acting was superb. Even the children were masterfully done, which is not always the case. And the OP is incredible, both visually and music-wise. As far as my enjoyment, I think it goes without saying I thoroughly enjoyed this series. I was not bored by a single episode.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it is truly one of the best anime I have seen to date. There is a fair bit of hyperbole surrounding the ending and its subsequent backlash, but I urge you to go in with an open mind and decide for yourself. You're in for a treat.",

            "content": "Erased is overrated.\r\n\u201cDid I just say that out loud?\u201d\r\nAs with every season, there must be some anime that spikes in popularity, polarizing the audience between those who tout it as the greatest anime ever made, and those who decry it as nothing but a cheap, poorly written knockoff of another, more popular anime. Are there truth and merits to both sides- the fans and the haters? As with anything and in every season- there sure are. So, let\u2019s examine Boku Dake ga Inai Machi and see exactly what it does and doesn\u2019t do. This review is written with the assumption that the reader is atleast aware of the premise of the show. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArtwork and Animation: 6\\n\\n\r\nAnother of the myriad A1 Pictures anime that come out every season, Boku Dake ga lacks the luster of titles like Sword Art or Blue Exorcist, and is certainly one of the least flashy anime I\u2019ve seen recently (the near complete lack of action and generally subdued nature of the show is about 99% of this) . The design of the characters is standard fare for A1, with the black mop-haired protagonist and a set of about six stock characters they swap features out on for everyone else. It\u2019s not bad looking by any means, but neither is it anything spectacular. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound and Voice Acting: 7\\n\\n\r\nWell, I\u2019m sure AKFG (Asian Kung Fu Generation, for the uninitiated) has a ton of new bandwagon fans now, from the use of their 12 year old song \u201cRe:Re:\u201d as the opening theme. I can\u2019t be too indignant, though- as \u201cSol-Fa\u201d is a fantastic album that I\u2019ve owned for years. \\n\r\nLike the section before, there\u2019s nothing particularly outstanding about the performances, but it\u2019s nice to hear some different voices- including Shinnosuke Mitsushima in his first role as the protagonist Satoru. Aoi Yuuki (Madoka, eponymous), moe voice extraordinaire also gives a solid outing as the deadpan Kayo.  Longtime industry veteran Minami Takayama (Conan, Detective Conan series) provides an anchor in the role of Satoru\u2019s mother, Sachiko. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters and Story: 7\\n\\n\r\nWe\u2019re introduced to Satoru Fujinuma- a 29 year old wannabe manga artist who schlubs it as a pizza delivery boy by day. Wholly disinterested and so-above-that, Satoru is a bit frustrated. His mom drops in on him unexpectedly like he\u2019s still in high school, and as Mick Jagger once said: \u201c(he) can\u2019t get no sa-tis-fac-tion\u201d. However, the break in this monotony for him is that he\u2019s discovered that he has a special ability- he feels that something is off, and then is transported back in time a few minutes, giving him the time to figure out what\u2019s about to happen and either prevent or divert the accident or calamity. This phenomenon he dubs \u201crevival\u201d occurs with fair prevalence- and it\u2019s mentioned that he\u2019s been the unsung preventer of an untold number of accidents. Material frustrations aside: one thing bothers Satoru above all others- a deep regret for the murders of three children, back in 1988; two of which were his classmates, and one of his best friends. \\n\r\nIt doesn\u2019t take long for the comparisons to Steins Gate to start being made- but where the strengths of this story lie are outside of the ever-illogical concept of time travelling. It may be a presumptive on my part, but I think we should all understand two terms before progressing further into any analysis of this show: \u201csuspension of disbelief\u201d and \u201cinternal logic/consistency\u201d. The suspension of disbelief is the concept that a person knows what\u2019s happening on screen cannot possibly be real, and yet must temporarily accept it as being reality in order to be entertained. Note: there will be no claims of \u201cunrealism\u201d in this review, except where it\u2019s unrealistic that a 29 year old Japanese man in 2006 would not understand how seatbelts work. \\n\r\nThe second term is one that I think more people don\u2019t really consider when watching anime. I use the show \u201cDeath Note\u201d as an example here. The object, the Death Note, has very clearly defined, set rules governing its use. These rules are not subverted or thrown away later in the show when it becomes inconvenient for the character. This is called maintaining internal consistency or logic. If it\u2019s established that a superhero can fly, then the logic of a show dictates that a character flying should not be impossible. This might seem like a real \u201cduh\u201d moment, but keep these in mind. \\n\\n\r\nErased does a very good job maintaining its logic and consistency, especially for a time travel show \u2013 this is important later. Yes, we all know that time travel can open up an enormous package of swiss cheese as far as the plot is concerned, but this is kept to an absolute minimum and not ran wild with as in some other shows. As with Steins Gate, the focal point of the show is that a character goes back in time to fix a problem- which then begets more issues. One small tweak in the past can change a cluster of things in the present- with no guarantee that Satoru can return to that past moment and fix anything. \\n\r\nAfter Satoru\u2019s mother, Sachiko, witnesses what she believes to be a kidnapping, she is attacked and murdered in Satoru\u2019s home, with him being framed for the murder. He experiences a \u201crevival\u201d moment, and is transported into the past of the Showa era 63 (named for the emperor of the time), or 1988; a time when Satoru was in the 5th grade. The same year that his classmates were murdered. Having gone back in time with his knowledge and memories of being a 29 year old man in 2006, he realizes that the reason he went back must be that there is a link between his mother\u2019s murder and the murder of the children, those 18 years long past. \\n\r\nWhen Satoru is sent back, he knows the clock is ticking, and that he has to first prevent the kidnapping and murder of one Kayo Hinazuki- a rather stoic and antisocial girl. Given that he\u2019s operating with the memories of his elder self, but in his child body- Satoru is (un)naturally a bit more keen and dissimilar from his peers; a trait which he also shared with his younger self. Many of his classmates think that he\u2019s strange, and that he somehow puts on the face of someone else because he\u2019s unable to empathize. This oddness is compounded by the fact that he now has to pretend to be a child a third of his current age, with much inferior reading comprehension, speaking ability, critical thinking, problem solving, and other mental faculties that develop as one ages. We have to imagine that this takes a toll on the character, keeping up this front of being a child again, and that perhaps because Satoru was among his friends and having to expend so much energy to play at being a kid (I've thought about this before, and it would be hard to be a child again with my current knowledge and memories) that maybe he regresses somewhat- losing sight of his goals and making more decisions and observations as a child would, and less like his adult self. They reinforce this idea in episode 11 with memories being merged, (I think this was signified by having the kid version of him speak when he was waking up and trying to remember, rather than the 29 year old narrator version). \\n\r\nHowever much good the story does though, it takes a backseat to how hard the ending falls apart. While Erased does use the famous amnesia trope (found in nearly every anime it seems) well, it sets up a really uninspired and trite ending. Some may contend that the ending was heartwarming, but it all boils down to the typical \u201cfriendship can overcome any adversity\u201d and a villain with Machiavellian intent getting caught with their pants down because the show had to end. There was no reason for the villain to return to see Satoru in the future, but it happened anyway- and the ending\u2019s writing reflected the poor choices of the villain at a rate of 1:1. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is quite easy to watch, and has a very nice flow to it. That\u2019s not to say that it\u2019s the best paced anime- as the ending two episodes move at a markedly faster clip than the rather methodical way in which the rest of the show was laid out- but it flows well. Erased watches a lot like a movie, which is even symbolized within the show itself. The episodes segue into each other very well- generally picking up within moments of the previous one, sometimes at the exact same point the previous left off- with only minimal to nonextant backtracking. It also makes use of good cinematographical elements, and is (shot) drawn much like a live action movie would be. That is, there aren\u2019t many, if any, impossible or \u201canime\u201d angles. It\u2019s set up to be as though the audience is right along with Satoru and the others, watching as the events happen to him. The narration is also a well done facet- not intrusive, but gives needed exposition when appropriate- in the form of Satoru reminding himself of what it is he\u2019s seeing in his mind\u2019s eye. The only things I really disliked about the show were the forced-feeling emotional moments (child abuse for the sake of it? douchebag parents just cause?), and the abandonment of a character and practically the entire plot when the character\u2019s issue was resolved. The show changed gears, moved a lot quicker, and was overall worse for it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\\n\r\nHow does this reviewer find the defendant? Well, it may be guilty of a few anime crimes, but it\u2019s certainly very watchable. Is it deserving of being in the top 5 best anime of all time? Certainly debatable, but solidly within the realm of \u201cno.\u201d This anime transcends nothing but its own logic, and as a friend of mine once said: \u201call it takes is a modicum of emotional involvement to get everyone to believe it\u2019s a masterpiece.\u201d Erased isn\u2019t as emotionally manipulative as say, anything that Key has made, but there are moments where they definitely serve some melodrama up on a plate. There are many better anime than Boku Dake ga Inai Machi, and there are many worse. At the end of the day- it\u2019s a pretty average show- probably to be \u201cErased\u201d from the annals of top lists by next season. \\n",

            "content": "Boku dake ga inai machi, also referred to as \"Erased\" or \"The Pinnacle of the Winter 2016 Season\" was quite a short ride. Certainly, it was fun and enjoyable. The show was decent, but 12 episodes are just not enough to really explain everything and this is why I experienced this show as a bit superficial and bland.\r\n~Story~ 6/10\r\nThe main concept of the series wasn't exceptionally original, a lot of other shows (e.g. Steins;Gate, Charlotte) are based on the same idea: time travelling. However, Erased (I'll just use the English name because it's shorter) used this idea in a surprisingly refreshing way. The plot seemscomplicated at first, but once you get used to the setting it is quite easy to adapt to it. Our main character is Satoru Fujinuma, a 29 year old with a very strange ability. This ability enables him to travel back in time whenever a tragedy is about to strike a person around him. One day, (warning: minor spoiler) his mother gets killed by an unknown person. Satoru is wrongly accused and this time he gets sent back in time 18 years, which means he is 11 years old in parts of the story. He realizes that the murder of his mother may be connected to the abduction and killing of one of his former classmates, Kayo Hinazuki. I personally think that Erased used the concept of time travelling in a unique way, and the first couple of episodes were really enjoyable. However, the second half of the series were a let down. It already became clear to me who the murderer was around episode 6, I won't say who it is in this review, but what I will say, is that I found the climax to be unsurprising and predictable. I didn't like the epilogue either, it left way too many things open, especially the motive of the murderer. They completely ignored that and that's part of what disappointed me about the ending. The setting in this show was good, but in my opinion, the execution of it wasn't a very big success. It was rushed waaaay too much.\\n\r\n[CONCLUSION]\\n\r\nThe story was really promising, but ended up disappointing me. The end was too open in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\n~Art~ 9/10\\n\r\nI don't have a lot to say about the art in this series. It was beautiful and unique. It was quite obvious that this show was animated by A-1 Pictures, it definitely resembled some of their previous works. The only negative thing I have to say about it, is that it didn't feel dark enough at some times. However, the animation of the show really grows on you and you can't really state that the animation was bad, on the contrary, it was very professional. It's just that it might have been a bit too bright at times.\\n\r\n[CONCLUSION]\\n\r\nThe art in this show is amazing, however it wasn't dark enough at times.\\n\\n\r\n~Sound~ 8/10\\n\r\nI adore the opening of this show. ASIAN KUNG-FU is a great band and I was happy to hear one of my favorite songs by them as the opening theme of this. The ending of the show was great too, it really grew on me. There wasn't anything special about the OST's, but they were decent. \\n\r\nThe voice acting was impressive too, the voices really matched the characters.\\n\r\n[CONCLUSION]\\n\r\nThe opening, ending and voice acting were great. The OST's were mediocre, but they did the job.\\n\\n\r\n~Characters~ 5/10\\n\r\nThis is, in my opinion, the weakest point of this anime. Because the characters were a bit bland in my opinion. The only person we really got to know was Satoru, because the story was told from his perspective. As for the rest of the characters, I didn't think they were very intriguing. Most 11 year olds acted like adults, and that's what felt really unrealistic to me. I mean, it made sense for Satoru, since he is actually 30 years old. \\n\r\nBut Hinazuki for example, she was almost as mature as me... and she's an 11 year old. Also, she wasn't interesting. We were basically just supposed to feel sorry for her. Another example of this is Kenya, who was even more mature than Hinazuki and Satoru combined. Also, he didn't even do anything in the entire anime. The directors made him incredibly smart, but it didn't really make any difference. What's the point in creating a super intelligent character when you're not even going to use him? Kenya is the definition of wasted potential.\\n\r\nI couldn't really take this show serious because of this.\\n\r\nAnother flaw considering the characters, was the murderer who (again: I won't say who it is here) apparently didn't have a motive whatsoever. It didn't make sense, and I'd hoped for an awesome backstory explaining why he committed the crimes, but there wasn't anything meaningful considering that.\\n\r\n[CONCLUSION]\\n\r\nThe characters in this show were quite generic and disappointing to say at least. The only person we really got to know, was Satoru.\\n\\n\r\n~Enjoyment~\\n\r\nI might have pointed out some major in this series here. These flaws didn't stop me from enjoying this show. Every episode was different and I have to say, when this was still airing, I would immediately watch the new episode after it aired. Even though the ending and the characters were disappointing, this show was still unique and fun to watch in my point of view.\\n\r\n[CONCLUSION]\\n\r\nThere are major flaws in this series, but the show never stopped bringing the fun. It was a decent watch, and since it's only 12 episodes long, everyone should just give it a chance.\\n\\n\r\nYes, this show is far from perfect, but it's not as bad as some people claim it is. I'd recommend this show to anyone who wants to have a good time watching a short but fun show with a fantasy setting. But don't make the same mistake that most viewers made when this show was still airing: don't expect too much of it, because you will be disappointed in the end. Peace.",

            "content": "STORY: 9/10\r\nCHARACTER: 8/10\r\nART: 9/10\r\nSOUND: 9/10\r\nENJOYMENT: 10/10\r\nOVERALL: 9/10\r\n\u2018Erased\u2019 happened to be one of the most awaited anime in recent memory and rightfully so for it bewitches the audience with its 1st episode, sucking you in for a rollercoaster ride of enthralling emotions! It takes a while to realize how strongly invested you are with the story, for the set-up is excitedly engaging, leaving you happy and confused at the same time. Even though the anime presents itself as a Mystery genre with a gripping murder plot that\u2019s supported by Supernatural theme with a Time Travel twist added to it! I beg to differ for I see\u2018Erased\u2019 as a Psychological Thriller with Mystery elements sprinkled within a Time Travel story! This explains why the story never focuses on leaving clues for the audience to predict the killer, leaving little to no impression on its Mystery aspects and rather engrossing us with an intense and suspenseful plot. The MC, Satoru, happens to have the power of Time travel but they occur randomly as he has no control over it. Since these flashes only occur when something bad is about to happen, it\u2019s his job to find out where a potential disaster is incoming so that he can revert it from ever happening! Through a series of events something very bad happens to him which activates his powers to go back in time. Unfortunately, he isn\u2019t sent back a few minutes or an hour or a day or a week, in fact he gets sent back 18 years in the past indicating this is where the problem all began! This is a dark show about a serial killer who kidnaps young girls but its rounded up with a sense of hope in the form of a young boy who can stop this. Plus, they manage to keep a light tone as well by adding in a coming of age story which it technically is as Satoru now happens to be an adult inside a child\u2019s body! And this is where the anime varies itself by introducing a unique plot of an investigation that\u2019s conducted by a child with the brain of an adult thus presenting us to a whole new level of drama! This anime earned my respect because it could handle its dark themes without every making it creepy while also smoothly upheld its sense of humour which is impressive. So, I wasn\u2019t bothered when Satoru bonded with the young girl or the alarming subplot of abuse because they were prudently addressed with respect for both the audience and the characters. The one problem of the show came with the identity of the killer which was easily decipherable due to the few number of suspects to begin with, but this didn\u2019t bother me much unlike others for I was repetitively captivated by the mature characters and its comprehensive storytelling!\\n\r\nEarly on Satoru realizes that his case relates to a string of kidnappings which took place 18 years ago, and it started with one of his classmates, a young girl named Hinazuki who was murdered when he was just a kid! So now he must befriend this secretive girl who chooses a private and unsociable lifestyle unlike her classmates while also exerting his cover by attending his classes and friends. And going on this journey, where he strives to attach himself and connect with the reclusive Hinazuki just so that he can give her a future was tremendously moving! Satoru\u2019s undying determination and kindness really helps define him as the story makes a hero out of him despite his generic look while Hinazuki only comes off as emotionless and reserved at first, you later discover the depth of isolation within her. They perfectly seized a certain allure to her, making her come off sympathetic, as if she\u2019s just waiting for someone to save her from this bleakness, someone she can confess to, someone she can befriend. The mystery elements are introduced in the shape of Satoru trying to piece everything together. I would have started with his mom but surprisingly he didn\u2019t question her. Shame because I liked her, I found her funny and caring at the same time. As for his friends, they didn\u2019t get a lot of screen time, but it was enough for my taste.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation has a simplistic yet proficient dash to it which perfectly fitted with the anime\u2019s tone by clouding us in an orphic and creepy vibe! Some parts like the snow scenes were wonderfully realized, often times tricking you into believing you are watching a high budget Anime Movie! In addition, the OST is a standout which knocks you off your shoes with an amazing OP that\u2019s hard to skip at the start of each episode! The show makes a point of stressing on their soundtrack, especially during those dark transitions which totally grounds the plot and setting to a graver authenticity. The voice acting was nicely done with the MC being the standout. \\n\\n\r\nTime travel stories aren\u2019t easy to predict, the same can be said about a good Mystery as well and since Mystery isn\u2019t the main aim for \u2018Erased\u2019, it\u2019s kinda predictable so you may solve the case quickly but it\u2019s the journey that counts! Plus, even the MC doesn\u2019t crack the actual mystery! He just saves the next victim by changing the timeline which might seem disheartening for Mystery fanatics, but you can rejoice with the knowledge that anything can happen since the chronology has been altered! Despite the show\u2019s effort to surprise you, the twists can be seen a mile away due to the small number of options presented to us! If you have seen or read enough mysteries, then you can sense the formulas being used. But if you aren\u2019t familiar with the genre, then the reveals are honestly startling! I for one found the unveiling of the murderer very intense and scary just because the predictably of it was peculiarly refreshing! And even if the Mystery falls flat, the suspense is delivered excellently by always imposing this sense looming danger which is why this show draws audience. My reply to the show\u2019s weak mystery is this: I feel like the point of the show was to see how different Satoru\u2019s life has become, it\u2019s like he got a Second chance with life! He was a loner before, a hero but a loner. This time around he has friends who actually care about him, he saved lives of so many children back then. That\u2019s why the meeting in the hospital between Satoru and Hinazuki is so emotional! A few blatant mistakes could have been easily corrected to make the show even better like more screen time for the other characters or the Time travel origin is never given nor explained why only the MC has this power. I also wish we had multiple culprits because that would have made the mystery element interesting and the final reveal that much shocking! The right kind of ending to any visual form of entertainment is paramount which is why the finale divides the fans, it\u2019s often the third act which either makes or breaks a show. The ending here was bittersweet, and it stretched the show\u2019s realism to a fiction regardless of the amazing work done earlier to ground the story as much as possible! Some didn\u2019t agree with the direction some characters ended up, but I found it to be completely satisfying and logical, so I wasn\u2019t bothered by it. Nevertheless, I strongly recommend this show as it grips you in suspense early on and never lets you go and the story and characters were well realized with care. So, this Gem of an anime shouldn\u2019t be left on your \u2018Watch List\u2019, instead you should watch it immediately! \\n\\n\r\n(!!ENDING SPOILERS!!)\\n\\n\r\nThe reason given by the villain wasn\u2019t well thought of, but I bought it because it was acceptable enough to believe this psychopath\u2019s obsession with Satoru. After all he did predict his moves so wanting to keep him alive is rational enough! The whole Coma angle hurts the entire momentum of the show because we skip 15 years ahead! They could have dedicated 1 episode to show us in a \u2018Fast Forward\u2019 fashion what happened in that period. Now regarding the Romance part, I get when fans were upset with how MC\u2019s ended up, but I had no problem with it because it made sense! First of all, this wasn\u2019t a Romance which is why the show focuses on Satoru\u2019s determination to save everyone! For fans to ask of Hinazuki to simply wait for Satoru to wake up is very unfair! I also wanted to ship them together but logic triumphs reason! Even the doctors didn\u2019t know when Satoru was going to wake up, so I was happy Hinazuki had moved on, but she never forgot who saved her, who brought her out of the shell, so I was happy the way things ended.",

            "content": "Let's face it, some of us don't want to see our love ones died right?\r\nBut this anime shows that there is hope. BokuMachi, or ERASED, is an anime based all about Child Abductions, Child Assault, Crime-thriller drama that is really dramatic to watch. To put it simply, this whole anime is more like, what if Detective Conan and steins;gate has a baby with some cute love story from KyoAni?\r\nBokuMachi's 12 episodic storyline is pretty dynamic with some backtracking the events of that scene or that episode. It turns out that Satoru has a power known as a \"revival\", or what it should been called as\"the butterfly effect\". In this kind of power, Satoru can go back in time whenever there's something bad will happened in that scene or setting. This power that Satoru possess is the main attraction of the whole anime in order to help and prevent the things that must needed to prevent before it's too late. If Satoru failed to changed the course within that timeline, he will set back to the present. And even though this is not particularly a Superhero anime, this anime is just focuses more on crime-thrilling, drama and love story.\\n\\n\r\nAlso the whole story can be watched by children as it focuses more on about child abduction, that way the children can prevent talking someone they didn't know in real life by showing what are the negative effects of it. (This is just only optional. But recommendable)\\n\\n\r\nThe story has so many twists and turns a we watch further on this anime. And how it will affect Satoru and the whole storyline whenever he triggers the butterfly effect. Which is very remarkable and understandable.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the Character Development of this story, like I said earlier, this is no Superhero anime like Naruto or Dragon Ball or Fairy Tail, due to the fact that only Satoru has only that kind of power but it can only being triggered if he felt something bad will happened. Also, as for the other characters, let's just say that I remembered the gangs of Detective Conan. What I meant by that, for those who didn't watch DC, the gangs is all about the young kids who help Conan to solve the case. This is the same way to apply the characters of Satoru's younger friends, to help those children that are in danger of getting abducted by a criminal.\\n\\n\r\nThe parents on the other hand, are played their important roles as well. But there are two kinds of parents, there's the caring parent and the abusive parent. That way, they will show us how the flow will go if these two met and how the caring parent is going to save the abused child and how the abusive parent will change and develop as we continue to know what will happened.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this anime are really great. And I really like how the flow of the story thanks to it's character development.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the art, I'd say it's pretty damn great though. But I hate when they spoil the Opening at the near ending of it when Satoru being chased by the bullet and there's a fragment of broken glass revealing who is the killer that made him go back in time.\\n\\n\r\nAnd speaking of OP, for the sound, the opening was came from my favorite Jap-rock band, Asian Kung-fu Generation. This band really brings happiness to me whenever I listened to their songs, especially their song from Naruto, \"Haruka Kanata\" and from Full Metal Alchemist's \"Rewrite\". But as for their song, \"Re: Re:\", I'd say it kinda out of place when they use it as the ending for the 1st episode. I mean, it really doesn't fit as the ending of the Ep. 1 is not very good then it turns out that the ending song is fun with a catchy rock guitar solo. But it changed on the Episode 2 when Re: Re: became an OP for the anime, and it's kinda cool though and I smiled. But it kinda lost there because it's all about crime solving, killings and child abductions. But still, it's good that AKFG made another song for the anime.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the ED, Sayuri - Sore wa Shiisana Hikari no Youna, I'd say this song is really fitted for this anime well. It brings the sad melodic message about a hero who tries not giving up to save that person.\\n\\n\r\nBoth has meaning of the OP and ED, it's all about time really is important. Time is the major role of the story here. And if Satoru didn't change the history in a good way, he will face the present in an unpleasant way.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the BGM of each episode, that really performs well to blend each storyline. However, there are only one comedy scene with one comedy BGM, so that's about it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I like it, and this anime can be watched by kids with some guide to parents or older to make explain about it. This anime has a lot of moral lessons here, and the story is pretty easy to understand. It has some \"awwww... :3\" moments to \"WTF?!\" moments that you'll surely get you at the edge of your seats. Also the climax on this anime is pretty damn great, but sometimes predictable, and the melodrama of this anime is filled with emotions with love.\\n\\n\r\nThe feels are real, ladies and gents, and this anime has a potential to be the best anime of this year, or maybe best drama of this year.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I recommend you to watch this anime, but don't forget to bring tissues...",

            "content": "NOTE: TL;DR for a quick summary at bottom | I keep my reviews SHORT\r\nI give Boku dake ga Inai Machi a 9/10 \r\n(May contain minor spoilers) Wow, Just wow. Erased took winter by storm. It showed to viewers that it can be one of the greatest anime ever made. It gives us a sense of mystery as well as a sense of love towards others such as our friends. It gives us hope of what may come in the future and ways to prevent it. Erased is an outstanding anime that I have seen. I especially love how this anime has portrayed the whole memorysubject in a movie metaphor. You can tell we are going through time by looking at the memories just by the OP.\\n\\n\r\nErased teaches us many form of things. From caring about the less fortunate, and to caring for your friends. Friends are what are made from childhood, so its only important to cherish them forever. TRUST is a big issue that has played in this anime. The anime has taught us that with trust, you can defeat a single battle with ease, even when it almost looks like the bad guy is about to win.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThe story follows Satoru, a aspiring mana artist who is once had this ability to \"reel\" back in time. Once, a close relative of Satorus' is murdered by an unknown killer. This unknown killer is the same killer who killed 3 children, back in 1988, 18 years in the past. Satoru is sent back in time (Very similar to Stiens;Gate concept of time travel), and is where he has 18 years ago with everyone alive. Satoru now must live a life of finding out who this killer is. What is his motive? Why did he kill those children?\\n\\n\r\nSatoru believes is he saves Kayo, he will change the future but it isn't just that simple. The process of trail and error is what keeps him going, having hope in what he is doing and becoming the hero that he has set out to become. We live the life of Satoru as a child as he finds to uncover the killer.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is really ORIGINAL and unique. Not many anime's do originally stories such as Erased has shown us. I really liked the concept of time travel to find the killer back in time rather than the present. The only thing that I find really annoying is the fact that the killer is too predictable later on in the middle half of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art is mind-blowing. The art really represents the atmosphere of whats going on and which timeline Satoru is in. The anime used clear, vibrant colours to show the anime is an amazing way like no one has ever seen before. Everything from the scenery to the character design was very well presented. This is an prime example of how a mystery anime should look.\\n\\n\r\nI especially like how the darkness and colours represented the mood. I noticed that it didn't snow when Satoru was in a coma but soon after it started snowing when he was able to be himself again.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe sound is a very well produced masterpiece in my opinion. I really liked how the OP was shown. It was metaphorically shown to show Satoru and his life throughout the cinema reel. I liked the OST that were presented in the background.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound just made the anime feel a lot more immersive and made the viewer feel a lot more engaged with the anime. Therefore the viewer will emotionally be attached to the anime that they just have witnessed right before there very own eyes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe characters played a big part in the anime. Apart from Satoru viewpoint, a lot of the characters played a big part in the mystery of the story. Popular characters such as Satoru and Kayo were immediately loved by people simply because of their unique personalities. Each character had their own personality, for example Kenya was the thinker, he would always think about whats going on and what doesn't seem ordinary.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally I loved the characters, I really liked how they all played a part in Satoru's investigation to saving the children and to uncover the killer.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nPersonally, I really enjoyed this anime. Each episode had me wanting more and sometimes it did end will really big cliff hangers which made me die. I had to wait a week just to watch the next episode which just comes to show how brilliant this anime was. I really liked how everything was portrayed. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, in my opinion, I didn't like the fact that the killer was too easy to predict which made me hate the story a little bit because I wanted to be someone who no one would ever suspect.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nOverall this anime is a brilliant show. It makes the viewer denote everything that the producers have encoded in the show. It makes them wonder who is the killer and what are his motives. I like how everything was shown, slowly at a time. Sometimes I did feel like the anime was rushed (especially near the end), but it didn't take my mind of the story. It was the ending that I deserved. My only remark on this anime is the killer was to predictable.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 8\\n\r\nArt - 10\\n\r\nSound - 9\\n\r\nCharacter - 9\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9\\n\r\nOverall - 9\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR - Watch this anime if you're in the mood for some mystery and want to uncover it bit by bit!",

            "content": "I just set up a MyAnimeList account specifically so I could review this amazing show.\r\nThe negative reviews kept me from watching this for over a year, but I decided to give it a shot last night and immediately regretted listening to the haters for so long!\r\nThough the art, music, and voice acting are all fantastic, the areas of this anime that shine the brightest are plot and character. The story is superbly well-told. And though there are a few side characters who are a bit too static, most of the characters have heartwarming depth and complexity that makes the story compelling. I laughed with them,cried with them, and railed at the author when something traumatic happened to them. And this author is completely unafraid to put the beautiful characters in this show through the wringer. That in itself makes this show unforgettable. But it's the shifting thread of hope that wends throughout the show that makes it impossible to stop watching.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character is relatable, flawed but compassionate, heroic in the most human way possible, and I was totally captivated by him throughout (as an adult and as a child/adult). The girl he wishes to save is so real and her soul is so tough-yet-fragile, my heart literally wrenched at the thought of harm coming to this precious child. And then we have the MC's mom--the single best anime mother in all time forever, trust me, I'm calling it right now. \\n\\n\r\nIf you're interested in an emotional roller coaster with depth, darkness and light, mystery, tragedy, hope, and a healthy dose of adorable awkwardness, this show is for you. Definitely put aside 4 hours to watch this straight through; once that first episode ends, you won't be able to pause for a second!",

            "content": "Hey, everybody TheCodeTrigger here and welcome to my next anime review.\r\nFor this one, we are taking a look at the Winter 16 anime Erased.\r\nNow unlike any other show that was airing in winter 16 hype was high for this one. Does its deserve the hype it gets?  Let\u2019s find out.\r\nErased was directed by Itou, Tomohiko and it consists of 12 episodes airing from Jan 8, 2016, to Mar 25, 2016.\r\nStory.\r\nThe story starts off with Satoru Fujinuma who has the ability to go back in time to prevent disasters from occurring and we are basically thrown in 18 years in the Satoru past of wherehe soon realizes that that murder is connected to the abduction and killing of one of his classmates named Kayo Hinazuki. Now this is now Satoru chance of making things right so that Kayo won't be murdered and as well as not being framed for the death of his mother in the future.\\n\r\n Now I have to admit. The first four episodes are fantastic and easily Anime of the Season material with great writing and story direction. \\n\r\nHowever as the story progresses the story starts to feel kinda rushed.\\n\r\nWe get more boring characters, the story itself slowly breaks due to bad writing that actually hurts the show for me.\\n\r\nAlso, the way they handle the killer was just terrible and rushed as hell.\\n\r\nAlso, keep in mind that this is a mystery series but through the whole fucking anime there is barely any mystery elements at all. We don't get any clues or hints about the killer because this anime lacks any mystery whatsoever.\\n\r\nThis makes your themes and genre feel pretentious.  \\n\r\nAt the end of the each episode, it ends with a cliff-hanger which is nice but over time unlike Death Note or Code Geass the cliffhangers of Erased are forced and they don't add attention value whatsoever.\\n\r\nOne thing that I want to point out is where the anime goes anime original in the certain part of the story meaning that certain scenes in Erased that meant to be explained are not explained at all in the anime.\\n\r\nOverall the story starts off promising but becomes lacklustre after episode 5 where it just becomes a mess. Not in a train-wreck level of messy but messy in its own right.\\n\r\n5/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\r\nThe characters in Erased like with the story starts off promising however like the story the character just become a mess or\\n\\n\r\nSatoru is one hell of the wasted potential characters because he is just bland to be honest.\\n\r\nOne thing that I was really disappointed is that where he didn't change as a character from episode 1 to the end.\\n\\n\r\nHinazuki is the only character from Erased that I actually enjoyed because she kind girl that gets abuse by her parents because for some unknown reason aka (Shock Factor) but at the same time she suffers like Satoru as she doesn't have a personality that defines her either (for the most part)\\n\r\nIn the end, Hinazuki just became one of those charterers that we feel sorry because you know Shock Factor.\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters are just dull and uninteresting to be honest because I really wanted to like these characters but I just couldn't. \\n\r\nOverall this character cast was a let-down for me.\\n\r\n4/10\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation.\\n\r\nErased was done by A1 Pictures the same studio that gave us Shigatsu, Kuroshitsuji , Sword Art Online and Shin Sekai Yori.\\n\\n\r\nThe art which I hate to admit is pretty good using a well soft colour pallet that mix perfect in the environment that the anime is trying to set.\\n\r\nThe character des the animation is nice with smooth movements with the characters and the environments. \\n\r\nI really liked the cinematic effect that shows the MC memories because it\u2019s looks nice and smooth but I wished they more advantage on that because it would have made a story better instead in my opinion.\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nSound. \\n\r\nThe OST itself is alright but compare to other anime from A1 Pictures like Shigatsu, Kuroshitsuji and Shin Sekai Yori it's not as memorable tbh.\\n\r\nAt this time of the review, the OST hasn't been released yet so I won't be mentioning any track on this.\\n\r\nThe OP theme itself is catchy and a good listen but for an anime that it based on time travel, it didn't work out for me.\\n\r\nThe ending theme is okay it's nothing to write home about really.\\n\r\nAt the time of this review, there is no English Dub announced. If it gets an English Dub in the future am just gonna write it off as an SAO type of dub,\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment.\\n\r\nI personally enjoyed Erased what is worth but at the same time, they could have done much better in the story and characters department after episode 4 because there so potential for Satoru character but in the end he's Satoru arguably ruined my enjoyment for the series.\\n\r\nAlso, I wished that Erased was 24 episodes because I would have enjoyed the series more and actually adapt the last two episodes instead of presenting us with anime original content.  \\n\r\nI personally enjoyed the opening because it was nice and catchy.\\n\r\nI just love the cinematography in this anime it\u2019s just looks nice and presentable of the world that Satoru was living in the past. \\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts.\\n\r\nErased had a good concept.\\n\r\nIt had an amazing first four episodes with good writing amazing visuals and a solid story.\\n\r\nHowever after episode four the show just become a mess with the remaining episodes being lackluster two of them being anime original mind you, poor writing come into play in certain scenes and the ending itself was just terrible in my opinion.\\n\r\nThe art is good but I wasn't a fan of the lips but I like the cinematic effect of the show.\\n\r\nThe OST was okay but nothing memorable but the OP was great and the sub is good on its own.\\n\r\nIt's sad to see that Erased is now just an above average anime because it has some things that I loved but the some of the cons in this show are just downright bad.\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re looking for time-travel done right watch Steins Gate because it\u2019s does the time travel concept probably and the characters feel more alive and they are memorable. \\n\r\nBTW Okabe is GOAT ^_^\\n\\n\r\nI give Erased a 6/10.\\n\\n\r\nAnime recommendations.\\n\r\nSteins Gate\\n\r\nShinsekai Yori \\n\r\nToki Wo Kakeru Shoujo\\n\r\nNHK ni Youkoso!\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, this has been TheCodeTrigger and I will see you guys next time.",

I want to tell you that this is one of the greatest shows of all time without writing a synopsis. It's not shounen. So it avoids over dramatic voice acting or slap stick sappy comedy. It's a serious dark show but the best of all, it doesn't go overboard with the darkness. The nature of the story itself is dark, and the show doesn't try and unnecessarily add extra dark elements. \r\nFor a short series, it does an amazing job in character development without having to focus too muchon every character. You get a very clear idea of what each character represents. There aren't any unnecessary plot twists so you'll never get the feeling that the author ran out of ideas. \\n\\n\r\nI'm extremely bummed I have nothing to look forward to on Thursdays anymore.

            "content": "Boku Dake ga Inai Machi ran from 2012 to 2016 in its manga form from author Sanbe Kei. At the beginning of 2016, it also got an anime adaptation from A-i pictures. Which concluded in March. This is the same studio that gave us Kuroshitsuji, Anohana, Valkyria Chronicles, Uchuu Kyoudai, Sword Art Online & OreImo. For me, their track record has been extremely mixed. With some of those anime being strong, some being more middling and some, SAO & OreImo, being foetid piles of excrement. So, let's look at Boku Dake ga Inai Machi and see how it compares to the studio's other works.\r\nStory:\r\nSatoru isa failed manga artist making ends meet by delivering pizzas. He also has a strange power, revival. When something is about to go wrong around him, he finds himself a couple minutes back in time so that he can search for signs of what's about to go wrong and intervene. During one such incident, he saves a young child from an out of control truck and gets in an accident in the process. His mother shows up to his flat to help him recuperate. While they're out shopping, he experiences a revival and asks her if she notices anything amiss. She spots someone about to abduct a child. He notices and scarpers. She snaps a picture of his car and is reminded of an incident from when Satoru was a child. She mentions a belief that the case is still unsolved in spite of a man being in prison for it. Later on, Satoru returns home to find her murdered and he's the primary suspect. In grief and panic, his mind reaches 141.6 km per hour and he experiences the biggest revival of his life, with his mind sent all the way back eighteen years to just before the serial abduction case. In order to change the future, the now eleven year old Satoru has to find the truth behind the incident and prevent it from happening.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the premise is very compelling, there are some pretty significant flaws with the execution. The most substantial being that the mystery element is too obvious. While there aren't many clues to go on, there also aren't any suspects that fit those clues and are also major enough characters to be viable except one bloke. So, you can pretty readily figure out that it's either going to be that guy or the Baron showing up out of nowhere. The series could have really benefited from having more major adult characters who could have potentially been the culprit. There's also a bit of a problem with Satoru gaining knowledge out of nowhere. For example, there's a part where Satoru is looking over the files on the abduction case from when he was a child and he somehow knows instinctively that the killer murdered one child in particular to throw suspicion off of himself. What, did he peek at the script? But that actually brings me to another story aspect that bothers me. The police investigation of this case was downright inept. From two young girls being murdered, they came to the conclusion that their culprit was definitively targeting girls and only girls. Seriously? I'm pretty sure that a sample size of two victims is not enough to make definite claims about someone's modus operandi. I'm sure they'd look for commonalities, but I'm also pretty sure the response to a boy joining the victims wouldn't be \u201cour perpetrator must have thought that he was a girl.\u201d At that point, it's just as likely that the culprit is just going after children and doesn't care about their sex.\\n\\n\r\nOn some more positive notes, the premise is highly compelling. And, while the mystery falls woefully short, the thriller element is very strong with a lot of strong tension. The series also does a really good job of tackling some difficult and serious issues like child abuse. The ending is really good. The series also does have a very strong atmosphere with a lot of really good scenes playing off of it. The anime is also pretty well-paced especially given how much longer the manga version is.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nBoku dake ga inai machi is one of those works where the shortcomings of the plot are somewhat offset by the strength of the characters. It has a really strong cast. Sachiko is, quite possibly the best anime mother I've ever seen and her strength as a character really helps add to that tension since part of what Satoru is trying to do is save her. His young friends are also pretty complex characters who still manage to feel like children. Some people may take issue with Satoru's character and how his young self, in spite of having his adult mind, still acts largely like a child. However, there are two possible explanations for it that would make complete sense. The first is that he has the adult's memories and knowledge but he's sharing his mind with his childhood self. One of his friends even suggests that, at times, he seems like someone else which would support that idea. The second possibility is that he has his adult mind but he still has an underdeveloped child's brain so that he can't fully utilise it. Which would make sense based on actual brain development. It could also be a combination of the two, I suppose. The point is, I'm not going to complain about the story not explicitly stating it when there are ready explanations that make perfect sense.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork and animation in this are well done. There are a lot of nice details and it does do a really superb job of helping build and maintain that atmosphere. The film reel image for Satoru's time travel is an effective one. About the only thing I would say in criticism of it is that the character designs are pretty standard. They look fine but they also look like the characters you'd see in a lot of other works. Exempting only the pronounced lips on certain characters.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThis series does have a strong cast. For me, the performances that stood out were Mistushima Shinnosuke & Tsuchiya Tao (as older and younger Satoru), Yuuki Aoi as Hinazuki and Takayama Minami as Sachiko. There really weren't any weak performances, but those four were the best. The music, on the other hand... it's all right. Kajiura Yuki has certainly done a lot better but there's nothing really wrong with it.\\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nThis series really doesn't have any. It doesn't do much in terms of romance, really.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nBoku Dake ga Inai Machi is a good series. The weakest aspect is the narrative itself which, though flawed, is still decent. Aside from that, the characters are great. The artwork is good. The acting is great and the music is decent enough. If the premise seems interesting to you, even knowing that the mystery is weak, try it. If the mystery being weak is going to ruin it for you or the premise doesn't seem interesting, give it a pass. For me, it's a solid 7/10. Next week I'll be looking at another request with Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu. We'll see how that goes.",

Conversations sometimes too good sometimes really bad. Overall you'll feel like there's 2 authors one is amazing and one is a beginner.\r\n- Art 8/10. you'll end up rewatching few scenes many times before continuing the episode.\r\n- Sound 8/10. If the openingand the ending involved here then my rating is 9.5/10.\\n\\n\r\n- character 8/10. 12 episodes each is a 22 minutes never enough to judge a character, but anyway they have different characters and you'll like them.\\n\\n\r\n- Enjoyment 10/10. cry, smile, sad, happy, and exciting. you're going to feel all of those and more\\n\\n\r\n- Overall 9/10.

I think that should be fairly obvious so I'm not gonna focus on the good parts too much but the first 4 or 5 episodes were amazing. They were so emotional. Truly indescribable. 11/10 if you will. It kinda went downhill afterwards for me though not all that much but still.\r\nWhat I found kind of disappointing was that the culprit was hinted at a lot even early on and so I basically knew half way in who it was and no there was no plot twist whatsoever. By episode 10 youofficially know who the culprit is and then, well I can't really tell you because that'd be a spoiler but what happens afterwards is not a bad ending considering where they anime went with the last few episodes. As far as plot holes go, I haven't really noticed any except that the culprits motives (if you can even call them that) felt a bit far-fetched but I can deal with that sort of thing. The production itself however is pretty flawless (animation, characters etc.) I'm especially happy about the way the story is told and certain scenes are depicted.\\n\r\nSo, is this really the best anime of the season? Yeah, absolutely. You're surely gonna enjoy it if you haven't watched it yet.",

            "content": "Okay, so it\u2019s about time since I gave Boku dake ga Inai Machi (Erased), a review, I just needed a breather to take in the amount of feels I received from the last episode. \r\nI remember the hype waiting for this anime to be released, I can tell you now, it was worth the wait. For the longest time I had been searching for an anime THIS damn good. Just how good is it? Well let me explain.\r\nFrom the third episode in I was so hooked I jumped on board the manga like there was no tomorrow and smashed that out within the day. ILOVED IT, and without comparing it to the manga itself, I can firmly say that this anime went above and beyond my expectations.  \\n\\n\r\nStory: 8 \\n\r\nIt was refreshing to see a new mystery anime come out this year, and I can say that I thoroughly enjoyed it. It seemed to tick all the right boxes (mostly) and really had me on the edge of my seat every episode. To put it simply, a 29 year old man named Satoru has the ability to go back in time \u2013 revival \u2013 to fix up the past whenever bad things arise. Now this seems like the main plot, but woven within this is so much more. This anime tackles issues that are very relevant today and it succeeds. Without spoiling anything, I will say there is more than just murder and time travelling madness.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I am a little bit picky about is the time travelling itself, and yes there are plot holes if you think too far ahead. Like, how did Satoru grow up after he left his 10 year old self, who is he then? And couldn\u2019t he just keep going back in time to always win? I guess with time travelling animes, what can you do, right? \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing to point out is probably the anti-climactic ending. It was VERY different from the manga, and so it left me to believe that there will not be another season. I know that this anime is considered a \u2018mystery\u2019, but really? I think the baddie was a bit obvious, and when you find out who it is, trust me, you\u2019ll be sorely disappointed. But you know what? It still has that thrill to it.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nSTUNNING. I love this style and I wish that more anime\u2019s looked like this. The characters looked unique and the use of colours for symbolism is amazing. Especially the colour red. The art style itself was beautiful, and honestly I liked it better than the manga although they are quite similar. But seriously, the use of the block colouring and the character designs were done so well and used appropriately. Not to mention those flashbacks used as a film reel, and that tree in the snow, pretty damn smart. A ++ in this department.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nLoved it. Catchy OP, and really made me feel nostalgic and old for some reason, which I think was the point. The intense scenes were intense and the sad scenes were sad. It always fit the mood perfectly, and never was it used inappropriately. The ED not to mention was also very smooth. Love the soundtrack for Erased.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nIs it weird to ship a 29 year old with a 10 year old girl? In any other situation, hell yeah it would be, but though it seems really weird, in the case of Erased, this works perfectly. Don't believe me?\\n\r\nJust watch it and you\u2019ll understand.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I love about all these characters is the fact that they are all somewhat realistic. This entire anime just seemed so real. \\n\r\nSatoru was a great mc, I loved his complex mind and caring heart. He was flawed, not perfect, and this is what I loved (which is probably why he continuously goes back in time). How the anime managed to make a 29 year old an adorable 10 year old boy is beyond me. \\n\\n\r\nNow I know we\u2019ve all seen and been accustomed to that one quiet, emotionless, Kuudere, girl who seems rather typical, but for Hinazuki, YOU WILL UNDERSTAND PERFECTLY. Her quiet, shut off personality goes through character development that will make you cry. No joke. I love the relationship built upon the characters, it was taken at a perfect pace, and just made perfect sense. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the other characters, you\u2019ll love them too. The mum character who usually is useless, is not, and that annoying teen girl who is happy for no reason is not. Even though that one character Kenya is somewhat unbelievable (because let\u2019s be honest, no 10 old is that smart unless you were truly 29), you\u2019ll love him anyway. The baddie on the other hand was pretty much just a bad-guy. I mean, sure he had a reason, but I feel like in the manga it was explained so much better.\\n\\n\r\nSo, were the characters typical? No.\\n\r\nWere they extremely unique and original? As good as it can get.\\n\r\nI always find it hard to give 10 stars in this department, but I sure will give Erased a 9. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nThe anime was actually better than the manga, or at least I enjoyed it better. The visuals were stunning and the story, sound and characters worked in harmony. As much as I would love there to be a second season, I don\u2019t really see how they could do it. After all, murder mysteries can only last for so long, and with the element of the supernatural, I don\u2019t think it can really stretch that far without it becoming repetitive or just making no sense at all. So if you are wondering why Erased has gained so much popularity, go watch it. Don\u2019t listen to those people who call you mainstream, just watch this anime and receive the tears that Hinazuki did as she cried over bacon and eggs.\\n",

            "content": "5th top anime? Its either over hyped or the anime has some weird characteristic that most anime hasn't done before which blew away the audience. That was my thought before I started this anime and the anime was slightly guilty of both.\r\nAfter having some time to process I got to say that this anime really sticks with you. I constantly kept thinking about it. I was listening to the OP song and found a burning sensation to cry. \r\nRight off the bat I loved this anime. Its one of those bookmarked anime, that you tell your friends about to keep the fire that it startedalive. You don't want to forget it. I would do anything to experience watching it for the first time again.\\n\\n\r\nThe story was amazing. I definitely saw numerous types of similar aspects of plot lines in other media. But the execution and pace was the flag that made it one of the greats. Straight away I thought they could have made this into a movie and that thought enhances with noticing the high level of production that went into this anime. And am so glad they didn't even in 1 cour I don't think they put in as much as they should have. That being said the ending did have some pacing Issues but the the rest. Holy damn the rest.\\n\\n\r\nThis first 6-8 Eps of this was pure grace. I went into this anime knowing nothing and whoa was I blown away. Following the main character I was so invested into the story such as rooting for an underdog in a big fight. Yes he was special and know things that others don't but that didn't mean he didn't have disadvantages. What it comes down to is a kid trying to save his friend, whatever the cost.\\n\\n\r\nI forgot to mention that as much as this anime gives you the feels it is pretty damn funny especially given his situation. The MC has a tendency to blurt out what he is thinking (Hopefully not a spoiler) and producing some funny moments. \\n\\n\r\nIn summary this is an amazing anime which you should check out which is very pleasing to the eyes but if you want 100% pure awesome story as I've heard that the manga is the way to go. Which I'll also probably check out in the next few years, when this anime isn't so fresh in my mind.\\n\\n\r\nE.N. I wrote another review before following the guidelines of story, art, sound etc but that just seemed to robotic and hopefully I conveyed a perception of the anime in this review even more so.\\n",

            "content": "What would you change if you could revisit the past? Would you change your actions, your relationships; or would you perhaps do everything in your power to help someone else?\r\nOriginally, I wrote my review for Boku dake ga Inai Machi under the pretense that I had thoroughly enjoyed the anime; however, because of this I felt I may have been too biased and tended to ignore or avert my focus from the aspects of the anime which were poorly executed. After reading through various other reviews for Erased I've determined that I should rewrite my review with two main purposes: the first being to focuson the good and the bad with hopefully little bias, and the second being to actually motivate people to watch the show. At the moment the reviews for Erased seem very negative which would turn away many potential viewers - I feel this doesn't do the series justice seeing that many viewers (as one can tell from the overall rating of the series) did genuinely enjoy the show.\\n\\n\r\nIn an attempt to write a holistic review I'll focus on 5 key elements: Story, Art, Sound, Character, and Enjoyment. To begin I'll focus on the Story. \\n\\n\r\nThe Story of Boku dake ga Inai Machi, or Erased, was not \"bad.\" By no means was it perfectly executed but I felt it expressed what it wanted to express very well. To start this section I want to make note that this anime WAS NOT MEANT TO BE A MYSTERY ANIME. There are so many viewers who were disappointed by the mystery aspect of the show unaware that the mystery was not the show's purpose. It was stated in an interview with the director that Erased was meant to act as a suspense thriller under the guise of a human drama. The mystery element of the show was simply there to offer support to the suspense; rather than to be it's own focal point. If you go into Erased looking for a fantastic mystery anime then you will be disappointed, as you should be, seeing that the show was never meant to be that.\\n\\n\r\nWith that said, I felt the story was very well executed with the purpose of being a suspense thriller. Each episode was left off in such a sense that the viewer had the giddy tension of \"I must see what happens next!\" which does well to support that the story, at least in the manner of suspense, was well executed. The human drama portion of the show did not do as well as the suspense portion in terms of execution; I felt the child abuse, child neglect, kidnapping, and relationships in the show were done well but not as well as one would expect from a human drama focused show. The show did express well some elements of human drama; such as the idea that child abuse is heavily ignored even when witnessed by adults. Nothing was done about the abuse Hinazuki was subject to up until Satoru took a stand; which seeing as Satoru was a child during the time in which he took that stand does make a substantial statement about child abuse and the help provided for such a situation in reality. One element, though, which I felt was strangely executed in the human drama aspect of the show was Hinazuki's reactions to the abuse. She almost seemed indifferent about what was happening to her; which was a bit odd. Perhaps it was meant to express that she had become emotionally inept but without such an explanation it just seems strange to the viewer. \\n\\n\r\nNext you have the means by which each characters ended up the way they did, in terms of emotion and behavior. This topic was lightly reviewed throughout the series but I felt could have been done much better. In a human drama the way each person is acting is important, and therefore, the means by which they ended up acting this way is equally important.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, after reviewing the connotative elements of the story, we come to the plot itself. The plot was a tad ambiguous. There were a few parts of the show which felt \"unnecessary,\" or at the very least placed strangely in the order of events. Personally, though, I felt each scene whether it bore any relevance to the inherent story or not was enjoyable in its own right. Erased is more like watching a series of events which are unique in their own sense, rather than following one chronological story. The underlying chronological story is there to build upon and produce an end result, but each scene itself does not necessarily lend itself to that chronological plot. Some people may dislike this plot style, some people may love it; it's strongly a matter of preference.\\n\\n\r\nI will now move my attention to the art and sound. I, personally, felt the art and sound in this series were both done quite well. Now, that's not to say there weren't any frames that felt awkward; it was evidently noticeable that in a couple of the show's scenes things were drawn very strangely or poorly. However, for the majority of the series there was evident time and precision put into the art which really brought out beauty in the series. The sound was well executed and I felt it fit well to a suspense thriller series. I'm not particularly a sound-focused mind so I'm afraid I can't go too into detail regarding the sound production throughout the anime; though, there was never a moment where I felt the sound work was done poorly or was out of place. Some sounds seemed a bit loud, but that's about as far as I could go with genuine complaints. All in all the sound and art production for Erased was well done and fit the series itself very nicely. \\n\\n\r\nNext we move to the characters; the characters in Erased are a very important aspect, seeing as the show was primarily meant to act as a human drama. Personally, I quite liked the main character, Satoru, because for the majority of the series we got to see him act out the life of a child with the mind of a 29-year-old. I've seen many reviews note negatively that when Satoru would get flustered talking to the girls he was trying to save doing so would express a tone of \"pedophilia.\" I highly disagree with this logic as to me it seems the creator was trying to represent what happens when a 29-year old mind is stricken with the emotions of a young body. Not to mention it was interesting to see him attempt to continually keep up an act, masquerading around as a young boy when in reality he knows much more than those around him do. \\n\\n\r\nFollowing Satoru we have Kenya, who I feel could have been built upon better. Kenya was a very intelligent friend of Satoru's, yet didn't seem to impact the story too heavily. Aside from believing in Satoru and accompanying him, he didn't seem to impact the story much; though I don't feel his character was wasted because having a friend who understands and supports the lead is important in-of-itself. \\n\\n\r\nFollowing we have Hinazuki, who I felt was a well-conveyed character. I personally liked the way Hinazuki was scripted, but felt her reactions to her own situation weren't quite \"normal.\" Her reactions didn't much fit what was happening around her, but again I've referenced this earlier and gave my supposed reason for it. Aside from the strange reactions to her current predicament I did enjoy the innocence of a young child vibe that Hinazuki presented, along with her genuine reactions to finally receiving some compassion from others. These two aspects blend together to make Hinazuki a well-fitted character for her role.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, we come to Airi; a coworker of Satoru who believes in him throughout the story more than the others. I feel the purpose of Airi's character was to add some romance to the human drama in construction, however aside from that she didn't play much of a role. Now personally, I love to see romance subtly thrown into a series because I feel it adds to it, but people will have differing opinions. This comes back to my statement earlier that Erased is more like a sequence of events that roughly correlate to the main plot but don't follow it dominantly.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters in the series were well constructed, though played only subtle roles in the series as a whole; up till the end at least, which I don't plan to spoil. \\n\\n\r\nAs the last statement, I will review my enjoyment of the series. I highly enjoyed watching Erased. I'm going to be honest when I say that although I can see the negative elements of the show people are upset about I wholeheartedly do not feel that took away from it being a great show. It kept me engaged and built suspense, just as it was supposed to do; sure the mystery was easy to solve and only took me a few episodes at most but that was the point! I feel, just as I'm sure a majority of others do (based on the show's rating), that good and bad entwined Erased was a good series. Of course, this is entirely my opinion; just as this whole review has been (notice I've used 'personally' multiple times), and opinions are subject to differences. (of course it should be noted that even though this review was based on my opinion I did stick to my goal of alleviating as much bias as I could) - Some may love the show, some may hate it, but I definitely don't think it's an anime that should be passed up by any means.\\n\\n\r\nIn Summary, Erased was a good overall show with both it's positive and negative elements. It wasn't executed perfectly and many aspects of the work could use improvement, but it's by no means a 'bad' anime. It breaks all the clich\u00e9s we've seen far too much of and finally gives us some interesting material. I would recommend Erased to any fan of anime, clear and simple.",

            "content": "Boku dake ga Inai machi, or \u2018Erased\u2019 in its English title, is the anime adaption of Kei Sanbe\u2019s supernatural/thriller/mystery manga which had dominated the charts throughout its run in the summer season of 2016. At its peak Erased managed to reach as high as the 4th overall placement by score on MAL, while currently sitting just within the \u2018Top 50\u2019 range.\r\nThe 29 year old protagonist, Satoru Fujinuma, is a failing manga artist currently employed as a pizza delivery guy. Satoru is an unassuming person seemingly without any exceptional qualities, hence his current state of employment. His character design is pretty boring; the standard scragglybrown hair, slender physique, etc. this design choice does emphasize how \u2018normal\u2019 his life is at a glance, but this image is quickly and intentionally flipped on its head. During a scene of Satoru out on a delivery he witnesses a traffic accident, the frame distorts and a jarring sound blares. When Satoru returns to his senses, he realizes that he has been pulled back a few minutes into the past, where he has time to intervene preventing the accident from happening, Furthurmore, this is a common occurrence for Satoru.\\n\\n\r\nThis ability initially has some intrigue to it, as a viewer I really enjoy when time control is well executed in anime. The implications of cause and effect are vast enough that the idea can be explored in an innumerable amount of ways, and this style of vaguely introducing the ability provided them with infinite freedom to flesh out its mechanics; What conditions must be met to trigger a loop?, What\u2019s the extent and frequency to which Satoru can control it?, How did he come to possess this ability in the first place?, Are there consequences to using it? There were a limitless amount of ways they could have spun the idea, but they did literally nothing with it. It\u2019s mind blowing how so much potential was cast aside here. The only time Satoru ever mentions this incredible ability of his, he always says something to the effect of \u201cit\u2019s something that happens sometimes before a disaster\u201d. The ability is turned into a plot device; an unexplained contrivance which completely negates any tension the narrative attempts to establish. Anytime that Satoru messes up anything remotely important, he is returned to a convenient point without any consequences; Erased ends it\u2019s episodes on cliffhangers in an attempt to force tension, but it\u2019s always followed by an anti climactic payoff in the form of either a time reset, or a character appearing out of nowhere to help him out because plot convenience. The reasoning behind Satoru\u2019s desire to intervene in the these future situations during the early episodes is never explained or justified either, they leave it to the viewer to assume he is \u2018just a good person\u2019, which isn\u2019t preferable to providing us with set characterization. This way of writing let\u2019s Satoru act whatever way works best for the narrative, because the audience can just \u2018assume\u2019 things about how he thinks.\\n\\n\r\nBack to the narrative\u2019s lead up; after discovering that his mother has been murdered, Satoru becomes implicated as a primary suspect in the investigation, because he ran away from the scene. There is no motive, and no evidence, the decision to run away from the police was a stupid one that only served to strengthen the case against him when he was only implicated because of a misunderstanding to begin with. This is understandable considering his state of mind at the time, but even after he calms down his thought process remains unchanged. The dramatic crux of the introductory arc involves Satoru being sent back in time to 1988 when he was eleven years old. Events lead Satoru to the realization that the murderer of his mother might be the same criminal who murdered a young girl when he was in elementary school, killed the same year Satoru is currently reliving. By preventing the death of the child he can indirectly save his mother. This establishes Satoru\u2019s motivations, and leads us into an interesting setting. The only thing I have to question here is why Satoru is so certain that this will work, he doesn\u2019t question that this is the singular deciding factor of future events, even though there are a lot of things he can do over the next 20 years that would protect his mother.\\n\\n\r\nThe unique perspective of an adult living in a child\u2019s body is actually pretty well utilized. The biggest problem being the awkward hints of a possible romantic route for the relationship between Hinazuki and Satoru thrown in despite the obvious age difference, there wouldn\u2019t be a way to write this without it being absurdly creepy, so it\u2019s played off as comedic, and scraped pretty quickly. In his adult life Satoru was almost constantly alone, the only relationships in his life are with his mother, and a coworker who had taken a friendly interest in him. Whenever Satoru provides exposition as to what his life was like as a child, he always mentions that he had plenty of \u2018friends\u2019 but never formed a meaningful connection with anyone, something he came to regret as he grew up. This set a foundation of development for Satoru, he has an opportunity to improve himself layered below his primary motivation of saving his mother.\\n\\n\r\nKayo Hinazuki is the single exceptional character aside from Satoru, her character arc spans through the majority of the series early episodes considering she is the child Satoru is sent back in time to protect. Satoru has vague memories of Hinazuki from before her murder, but remarks that she was always quiet and doesn\u2019t know much about her. While attending school, now an observant adult, he notices a bruise on Hinazuki and quickly pieces together her situation at home. His suspicions of child abuse are later reinforced by the contents of an essay written by Hinazuki found later in the episode. She\u2019s presented to have an apathetic front covering her emotional nature, and she cuts herself off socially because she is afraid of getting hurt. Satoru and Hinazuki share some great dialog between them, and the contrast in their home lives create a really interesting character dynamic that leads into the biggest emotional outpouring in the series; Hinazuki\u2019s realization of what a family is supposed to be like, and her experiencing it for the first time in her life. Satoru act\u2019s under the impression that if he pushes Hinazuki\u2019s life in a direction of stability in enough ways, while watching over her as much as he can as a child, he can make her a difficult target for abduction, and eventually end the abuse she receives from her parents.\\n\\n\r\nOutside of Satoru and Hinazuki, everyone else in this series is made of cardboard. The other children are especially poorly written, their characterization over the course of the series doesn\u2019t even extend as far as being set within an archetype for some of them. They are vehicles in Satoru\u2019s development and nothing else, except for a child named Kenya, whose characterization actually makes him worse. His whole character can be described as \u2018the smart one who wants to be a detective\u2019, convenient for a mystery anime. Kenya\u2019s only relevance is to provide insightful exposition in uncovering the murderer\u2019s identity. What makes his character \u2018worse\u2019 doesn\u2019t lie in how minimalist his characterization was, but in that they made this 11 year old child smarter than every adult, including Satoru, in the entire series. Every character in Erased seems to act only on what Satoru tell\u2019s them to do, they don\u2019t even ask for specific details as to why a lot of the time. There is a point where the children help Satoru to practically kidnap Hinazuki for a three day span, they don\u2019t know that she is being targeted by a future serial killer, he tells them nothing about the situation, but they don\u2019t even bother to ask for a reason.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, Erased completely fails in the handling of its mystery element. The mystery genre is inherently difficult to write within. The author must attempt to introduce important information in a way that feels natural, while stringing these pieces together in a way that is difficult for the readers to follow, but at the same time, isn\u2019t esoteric to the point where the conclusion feels like an ass-pull. In Erased these clues fall into Satoru\u2019s lap without any deductive work on his part, everything Satoru learns about the killer is provided by info dumping through poorly contrived \u2018chance\u2019 encounters. I mentioned that the show has frequently used the \u2018red eyes\u2019 motif to establish dangerous elements, and to that effect it can also act as a \u2018red herring\u2019 to throw the audience off, but this is made transparent immediately when used for a character that was obviously just introduced for that purpose, or a character whose place in the narrative probably won\u2019t lead to him to be recurring again. I\u2019m trying to avoid spoiling key plot elements, but throughout the entire series there is only one reasonably suspicious and recurring character, and they couldn\u2019t have made it more obvious if they tried. This character is given a variety of creepy character traits that could hardly be called subtle, and he is literally framed in the shadows through many scenes; his reveal as the killer isn\u2019t even through deduction of the protagonist, or a mistake on his part, he outright displays himself to Satoru, and proceeds to soliloquy his intentions aloud like you would see from a cartoon villain. This character is as bland as an antagonist can get. His motivations are nonexistent; the vague reasoning they provide for him targeting Hinazuki essentially chalks everything up to insanity because the author couldn\u2019t think of anything meaningful to give his character. Throughout the final episodes his actions completely contradict his spoken intentions, and just make no sense considering his current position; passing up opportunities under justifications that go against everything he said previously, and this happens multiple times.\\n\\n\r\nErased tries to present a lot of creative ideas that sound interesting when put together, but there are a lot of times that it fails to bridge these ideas together in a coherent way, it often struggles with basic execution, and almost never expands on anything past the initial premise. Two characters are fleshed out and developed by the end, but most are just blank slates or act with flimsy justifications. Hinazuki aside, the characters don\u2019t really make a lasting impression. The time reset is never explained, and it triggers under so many different situations that any reasonable first conjectures were ruled out by the end, It acts whenever it needs to push the narrative forward without cleaver writing. With its unreasonable resolution and laughable antagonist, it utterly fails as a mystery series. I can\u2019t see myself recommending Erased for anything other than some brilliantly directed scenes throughout the show. Despite getting a fair amount of enjoyment from the series, notably in the early episodes, I don\u2019t feel like the end product is anything above average.",

            "content": "As an older, more critical than most, seen it all a million times before anime viewer I simply don't get wowed very often. In an ocean of anime designed for an audience I'm not part of it's only once in a great while, perhaps once a year or less, that an anime truly blows me away. With Erased, I got to experience that rare pleasure.\r\nArt-\r\nErased is gorgeous. I shelled out the money for the official Aniplex blu-ray, and if you know how Aniplex works you know that's not cheap, and this show was worth every penny. The animation was crisp, fluid, sharp and highly detailed.The colors were vibrant. The design choices hit all the right notes and there is a true feeling of artistically masterful beauty resonating from all corners of this show. Subtle touches, such as the main character's memories being displayed as a film strip, or the mysterious blue butterfly that accompanies the main character's special ability, revival, were small but beautiful details that created a sum bigger than its parts.\\n\\n\r\nI also give huge props to the main character being different from the generic teenage, awkward, kind and harmless new kid in town that we've seen a million times before in countless other anime. Instead our protagonist is older- a 29 year old man- and he acts like a realistic, mature adult and that's super refreshing. He doesn't remind me of any other male lead I've seen, which is not usually the case.\\n\\n\r\nSound-\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is from the goddess herself, Yuki Kajiura, who is simply one of the absolute best in the business. I have never heard a soundtrack from this woman that I haven't found to be a slam dunk 9.5 or 10 out of 10 and this is no exception. It's just beautiful. A couple of my favorite tracks from this show that I added to my playlist after the fact are Only I Am Missing and Sore wa Chiisana Hikari no Youna. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting, likewise, is excellent. In the dub main character Satoru gets a rock solid performance from both Ben Diskin, playing the adult Satoru, and Michelle Ruff playing Satoru as a child. Stephanie Sheh, Cherami Leigh and David Collins as Kayo, Airi and Yashiro respectively also deliver top notch performances, which is quite necessary as their characters all play important roles in the story. A story driven show like this one lives and dies by its writing and the performance of its voice cast and these guys deliver the goods.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter/Story-\\n\\n\r\nErased tells a complete story and takes the viewer on a journey and it is a fantastic experience. Minus one nitpick with the murder mystery that it's very difficult to talk about without inadvertent spoilers, the writing is fantastic and they approached things the right way and clearly put a lot of thought into a number of their choices. Characters are largely presented in a believable way, the pacing of the show is excellent, though one could argue the first half outclasses the second and it's a genuine emotional roller coaster that it's hard not to get invested in and care about. You'll absolutely be cheering for Satoru and Kayo and feeling the need to watch the next episode immediately and see what happens. The first half of this show was among the best six episodes of anime I've ever seen and had me 100% invested, interested and on the edge of my seat. \\n\\n\r\nAs I already spoke about I loved how the main character wasn't the disgustingly overused shy and awkward teenage boy in a school setting who meets a girl and something develops, but it wasn't just him. Kayo is not your run of the mill anime female counterpart, Satoru's mother is not your cookie cutter anime mom, the killer in this anime isn't a cartoonishly evil goober who dresses in all black and has horns and is blatantly evil from a mile away and Airi... I really couldn't name another relatively minor, secondary character I've liked more or been more affected by off the top of my head. Her role, compared to some of the other characters, is fairly minor but she adds something absolutely beautiful and emotionally compelling to the story and the show would have been markedly worse without her.\\n\\n\r\nThe first half of the show is a clear as day 10/10 and the second half is probably a 9/10. The ending was really enjoyable for me. It's difficult to talk about without spoilers, but I'm not a fan of the criminally overused cop out endings where the good guys 100% win and the bad guys 100% lose and everything works out exactly perfectly for the good guys and everyone is happy. There is simply no emotional depth to that. To really hit me in the feels there has to be consequences to the actions taken over the course of the story and indeed Erased meets that criteria.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack and voice acting were fantastic, the story was a true thriller with emotional depth and more than one moment really hit me in the feels. There are a couple small things one could nitpick but there really isn't much beyond that to criticize about Erased. I really, really enjoyed my viewing experience and was left in awe and wanting to tip my cap to multiple members of the staff when the credits rolled.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-\\n\\n\r\nFor me, Erased is a work of art and a masterpiece and one of the all time greats of the medium. So much love and care went into this show, all the small things were done right and I was genuinely emotionally touched. I couldn't recommend this one strongly enough. If you're even remotely a fan of thriller/mystery anime you're doing yourself a great disservice by not giving Erased a watch.\\n\\n\r\n+True thriller- a delight to watch\\n\r\n+Emotionally affecting\\n\r\n+Top notch soundtrack and rock solid voice acting\\n\r\n+Great pacing\\n\r\n+Great writing\\n\r\n+Gorgeous animation\\n\\n\r\n-Second half slightly less thrilling than the first\\n\r\n-Something about the killer. Won't spoil. You'll get it when you watch.\\n\\n\r\nOBJECTIVE RATING- 9.5\\n\r\nPERSONAL ENJOYMENT RATING- 10",

            "content": "Boku dake ga Inai Machi (which I will be referring to by its English title of \"Erased\" for the rest of this review) is an anime that dangles the lives of innocent children in front of its audience to evoke a reaction. It draws the viewer in with its interesting premise, attractive visuals and admittedly very good opening, but upon further inspection and analysis, it begins to unravel at the seams. Nevertheless, Erased managed to garner a very large fan base, and, as popular shows so often do, a significantly large hate following. I will attempt to be as objective as possible for the sakeof producing a better review, but to clarify, if you enjoyed Erased, that's perfectly fine. Anyone is free to like whatever they want, but what should not be ignored for the sake of personal enjoyment is the actual quality of the material being discussed. And when it comes to Erased's quality, unfortunately, it is severely lacking. As a warning, this review contains some spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nSatoru Fujinuma is a bitter, 29 year old manga artist whose career never took off. As a result, he spends his monotonous life as a pizza delivery man. However, what Satoru does possess is the incredible power of \"Revival\", allowing him to travel, according to him, from one to five minutes into his own past in order to prevent an accident from happening. Things quickly take a turn for the worse when Satoru's mother uncovers the truth on a series of murders that took place during his childhood, resulting in the killer from that time murdering her, only for Satoru to walk in on his mother's corpse and be framed for her murder. As expected, his time-travel powers activate, but, for seemingly unexplainable reasons, transport Satoru back to his childhood in 1988. He concludes that the way to prevent his mother's death must be somewhere in this time period, and quickly learns that it may be tied to Kayo Hinazuki, one of his old classmates who previously fell victim to the killer. In order to change the future, Satoru must now find a way to foil his mother's murderer by protecting Kayo, and eventually bringing the unknown perpetrator to justice.\\n\\n\r\nErased's premise was a large factor in influencing its rise to popularity, and while it does work, it is still laden with inconsistencies and lapses in logic. Satoru is seemingly convicted on the spot for the death of his mother, on what evidence? His neighbour saw him, in a quite obviously distressed state, mind you, lying in his hallway with blood on his hand, and as a result he goes on the run from the police. I can forgive Satoru for running away in the first place to an extent - he's just seen his mother's body, anyone would be horrified, and I cannot imagine that he would be thinking completely rationally at this point, otherwise he would most likely turn himself in and prove, through the sheer lack of evidence against him, that he had no part in the crime. He could even still travel back in time, the murder still took place, and that was what triggered the revival. What doesn't quite add up (another warning for you, real spoilers begin here) is that he continues to avoid the police after returning to 2006 at a later point in the story. For what reason? He's had more than enough time to recover from this incident, and, observing his behaviour in the past, he had recovered, and remarkably quickly. The revival power in itself is rife with flaws that I will discuss later, but while Erased's premise might have been intriguing and somewhat creative, but it seems like little thought went into it, and, perhaps most disappointingly, any potential it may have had was squandered by the rest of the show.\\n\\n\r\nI'd like you to place yourself in Satoru's shoes. You have just witnessed the death of your only parent and been made out as the killer by a ghost of your past. Now your time-travelling ability has sent you back into the body of a child, something you previously never thought possible, and now have the monumental task of protecting multiple children, some of which you had absolutely no relation with, from the very same psychopath that slaughtered your mother, all with the constraints of a child's body, 1988's lesser technology, and a very strict time limit. This pressure would, by any means, absolutely ruin a person mentally, warranting a number of Shinji Ikari-level monologues, and undoubtedly result in some heavy psychological damage. But not to Satoru. No, the worst he suffers from is a couple of freaked-out expressions and the occasional perfectly calm crying fit. He immediately adjusts to being a child again, playing the part of an eleven year old boy with such accuracy that not even the far more intelligent adults around him notice a change. I can buy the 10 year old kids not noticing anything, save for one, who I can only assume was either an elementary school valedictorian or another time traveller locked in the body of a kid. Satoru is so quick to accept every bad thing that happens to him that any chance of him being an interesting protagonist that you root for throughout Erased's twelve episode runtime is completely lost, and he comes off as something of a Gary Stu, lacking any real flaws. Even failure to complete his mission doesn't stop our Satoru, as he can just jump straight back into the past and try again. Supposedly his power activates as a result of deaths happening around him, so please explain to me why he can't just activate this at will? Why doesn't he just run under a bus or something? There's nothing to say that doing so won't take him back to the starting point in 1988, because we have no idea why Satoru's in 1988 to begin with. Actually, forget what I said about him being completely flawless. There's one flaw Satoru does have, and it's a glaring one, which I unfortunately don't think was deliberate, not that it'd be any better in my book if it was. Kayo and Airi, Satoru's coworker, repeatedly ask him the same question: \"Are you stupid?\" To which I frequently found myself responding \"Actually, yes he is.\" Satoru is an idiot. How he concluded that merely saving Kayo would be enough to prevent his mother's death in the future is beyond me, yet he completely devotes himself to it, even developing something of a romance with Kayo. Let me remind you that Satoru is not a child, but a 29 year old man, whereas Kayo is 10. The show seems to poke fun of this, with Satoru telling himself to get a grip, and that he can't think about these things, a problem he solves by continuing to think about these things. If Erased is trying to be funny, it fails because, shockingly, repeating the same unfunny joke again and again doesn't make it funnier, and if it's actually trying to develop a serious romance between these two characters, it's genuinely quite disgusting. It's a real shame too, because I was honestly thinking of congratulating Erased on making their relationship somewhat believable. It's built up pretty well, and some of their interactions might have been kind of charming, if I could only take my mind away from the fact that they're taking place between a 29 year old loser and a 10 year old abuse victim, which wasn't helped by the show constantly reminding me of it.\\n\\n\r\nThe most emotional part of Erased, and the part that its viewers fell in love with, was the Kayo arc, which takes up the majority of the show. Some suggested that once this arc ended, the show took a turn for the worse. It did, but in all honesty, even the first arc was nothing to write home about. Disregarding the potential immorality of Satoru and Kayo's relationship, the entire arc's emotional weight comes from, as previously mentioned, how sorry you can feel for an abused kid. Now, child abuse is horrible and shouldn't ever happen, obviously, but this is emotional manipulation at its most blatant. Of course I feel sorry for Kayo. Regardless of her actual character, which seems to be nothing more than a generic deadpan loli, she's going through real issues that traumatise people. However, when you realise that Erased is manipulating your feelings in such an obvious way and look past that aspect, it all begins to fall flat. When it can't affect you by throwing abused children at you and expecting you to cry, you're left to focus on the bland, uninteresting characters and the weak plot. The \"twist\" that happens about halfway through this arc is so obvious going in that any emotion it might have brought out of me was completely lost. Seriously, think about what Satoru was trying to do here, and tell me that it makes any sense that it'd work. Really shocking turn of events, guys. After this arc ends, everything becomes even more dull. It's not even trying to make you upset anymore, it just feels like it played its trump card way to soon and now has to tie up all the loose ends, complete with the uncovering of the true villain that I can't believe anyone didn't see coming. I won't reveal who it is, but let's just say that I'd hardly count it as a spoiler anyway, because of how obvious Erased makes it. It's done so that anyone who payed attention in earlier episodes can say \"Ha, I told you so!\" and think that they're really smart for figuring out the oh-so-puzzling mystery, which I just can't stand. If you have a tolerance for this kind of thing, more power to you, but it really rubbed me the wrong way.\\n\\n\r\nWhat interested me about Erased before I watched it was the talk about its excellent direction. Unfortunately, upon sitting down and watching it, I was let down yet again. Erased's direction isn't \"good\", it's just \"different\". What I mean is that, while it definitely stands out among its seasonal brethren, what people are hailing as intelligent directing really doesn't add anything, and comes off as an attempt to look different for the sake of looking different. I'll admit, there were some shots that I really liked. Satoru's first entrance into his classroom really made him out to be an outcast, divided from everyone else, despite the show not really doing anything with this theme other than implying that Satoru fakes his feelings towards others or something, before dropping it altogether. There were memorable shots, that much is certain, but being memorable isn't necessarily the same as being good. Some of the angles and transitions are very cool, yes, but there's looking cool and then there's substance, and Erased seems to favour the former. One feature of the directing that I found completely obnoxious was the fact that it felt the need to make some things completely obvious. Yes, I am aware that this character is suspicious, that much is observable through their mannerisms and speech. You do not need to give them bright red eyes and hide their face in the shadows in order to prove to me that this character is suspicious. Giving a short mention to the animation, it's not bad. Better than that. For as same-y that some A1 Pictures shows can look, Erased's character designs are different enough to make them all stand out, the uses of colour for the most part are very nice, and, most importantly to me, I noticed some definite fluidity in the animation that I feel many shows lack. It's not breaking new grounds or anything, but it's a standard that I'd really like more anime to aim for.\\n\\n\r\nLet's talk about that time travel power. Time travel is always dangerous ground to cover in any form of fiction, because of how hard it is to get right. I almost feel like congratulating Erased for taking this expectation and, stunningly, still managing to be a complete letdown. The origin of this power is never explained. Ever. Why can Satoru travel through time? How did he obtain this power, how long has he had it, how does he understand its limitations enough in order to tell us the rules in episode 1, but still become baffled when he is transported so far into the past? Furthermore, why does it send him to 1988? Why not just before his mother's murder? When he rescued the child from the truck earlier, it didn't send him years into the past to help with the truck driver's heart condition, so why? Never explained. Not a single line. This is important stuff - you can't just give this power no explained limitations when it's the main character's signature ability that moves the plot forward, and has the potential to remove all consequences from any action. The whole revival power is so poorly done that I could spend hours talking about it, but this review is long enough as is.\\n\\n\r\nErased wasn't devoid of quality. The visuals can be appealing sometimes, and if the horrifying implications of Kayo and Satoru's relationship were completely unintentional, then I can compliment it on building a relationship fairly well. Despite this, I can't ignore the countless flaws with it. Erased really isn't that different from your archetypal generic anime series, it just presents itself in such a way that it's harder to notice. But I noticed, and I hope that if you didn't, this review might help you figure it out too.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion:\\n\r\n+Visuals were unique and memorable, and occasionally intelligent.\\n\r\n+A believable character relationship, albeit squandered by gross implications.\\n\r\n- Pretty much everything else honestly, I'm not writing all this out again.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading, and please, form your own opinions on this show. If they differ from mine, cool. Enjoy Erased. It sure won't stop me from picking it apart, just like I won't stop you from having fun.",

            "content": "The Winter season of 2016 is nearing its end and one of the first series to come to a close is the widely popular ERASED, a series that literally everyone and their mother watched and it is thanks to this popularity that, as of now, it sits at the top of MAL's Top Anime list with a whopping 9.08! So is this show as great as people say it is? Well let's find out!\r\nERASED owes its popularity to a number of reasons. Reason one, it's a time travel story. It is an undeniable fact that the science fiction concept of time travel has been popularsince its conception in Mark Twain's 1889 satire, \"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court\". Since then, the idea has boomed in almost every form of media, to almost any kind of story, thus earning it immense popularity that exists even today. Meaning, anything that is time travel related is sure to be eaten and gobbled up by audiences like a birthday cake. Anime hasn't escaped this either. Throughout the years we were given films and series like Steins;Gate, The Girl who Leapt Through Time and so on and these titles gain massive popularity mostly because of their premise and what they delivered. In short, everyone loves time travel. \\n\r\nReason two, ERASED is a romantic mystery. And everyone loves those too. Satoru is an ideal character. Despite being a failure in life without many friends, he was a determined person who and this appealed to us. He chose to save his mother and a girl he barely knew to change the dark future and stop a mysterious killer. He expressed feats of bravery and spirit we could only ever hope to have through quick wit and action by attempts at foiling the killers plot. The story itself showcased the trials and tribulations of Satoru as he fought and fought against the dark force that he knows he must overpower to protect his friends and family while trying to save himself from being caught by the killer himself in the process. Does it make you feel excited? Of course it does. We're all suckers for this kind of thing.\\n\r\nAnd finally, reason three, and the most powerful aspect of this series, the audiovisual direction and presentation. I can talk all day about how fantastic ERASED is at its presentation. Through clever use of score, animation and cinematography, A-1 Pictures was able to create a truly compelling visual experience. You can tell, almost immediately, that there was heart put into the creation of ERASED. Captivating atmosphere, perfect pitches on ambience and tone, amazing timing of the score and use of the characters facial expressions. The voice acting was also superb and the two voice actors who were casted for Satoru did a great job conveying a single personality through two voices; an incredible feat in and of itself! Accompany that with a great OP song by Asian Kung Fu Generation and the mesmerizing ED ballad by Sayuri, it's no wonder the audiences are eating this thing up!\\n\\n\r\nNow we put these three together and what do we have? ERASED, a time travel romantic mystery with great direction and main character! A series that deserves its lasting popularity!\\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\nAlright, now that all of that's out of the way, let's talk about why ERASED is garbage.\\n\\n\r\nLike I discussed earlier, ERASED is a time travel story and it is true that people love these timeless tales of time. However, I never said ERASED was a good time travel story, much less timeless. Ugh. ERASED? Timeless? Boy, that'll be the day. Alright, let's get this rant underway. \\n\r\nNow, time travel stories all have their own sort of deal on how the actual time-traveling worked in their world, whether it be through a Delorean, an alien stopwatch, a cellphone powered microwave, literal \"leaping\" through time or waving your hand at nothing. In ERASED, we have this thing where the main character experiences backtracks every time something bad is going to happen to him or when he is in deep shit. The series calls it Revival but isn't there a more suitable name for it? Something like, I don't know, it's on the tip of my tongue-- DEUS EX MACHINA?? Now, hear me out, there's nothing wrong with this kind of time travel. We've seen it before in other stories, all working in different kinds of ways but if you're going to do this, at least EXPLAIN what you're doing. Because in all 12 episodes of ERASED, Revival has been nothing but a one-way ticket out of deep shit for the main character every time it's convenient for him. That's not to say that time travel powers that come out of the blue are bad. Let's take a similar method of time travel from the video game, Life is Strange. In the game, the main character can travel back in time anytime she wants with only the wave of a hand, however, there were always consequences, each of which the main character discovered through using her abilities. From what we got from the series, Revival is a flawless, unpredictable and cheap system made for getting shit done at pitch perfection and literally NOTHING ELSE. There's no sort of challenge for the main character thanks to this and any kind of explanation with regards to time travel or anything else about Revival is swept under the rug. And pretty much the closest thing we have to details about Revival is all intuition. Literally just guessing how it works happens to work in Satoru's favor. For a series that brags as a time travel story, its actual time travel is pretty shit.\\n\\n\r\nEarlier, I discussed that ERASED was a romantic mystery. Yeah, a garbage romantic mystery. But let's split the two for a while and begin with the romantic. Like I said, Satoru was an ideal character. Aside from having the qualities of a romantic hero, he had flaws, interesting dialogue and an intriguing personality. But there was a reason Satoru was the only character I mentioned in my words of praise and I will start off the reason why with my biggest problem and disappointment with the series and that is Hinazuki Kayo. While she was introduced as this lonesome girl with a mysterious personality, the series decided to crush the potential of her character into dust and turn her into a plot device to encourage Satoru to keep acting. What gets on my nerves is this is the 2ND TIME A-1 Pictures has done something like this, only much much worse that other time. And what a shame, really, for someone with that much potential and intrigue to be remolded into some mediocre character constantly victimized to appeal to the viewer's emotions. Their relationship felt genuine enough to be friendship but constantly distracted itself with its entire 'knight in shining armor' act. Gotta protect that smile. The rest of the characters, including Satoru's classmates, Yuuki-san and literally everyone else save for Satoru's mother, Yashiro and possibly Kenya, are all flat, underdeveloped and were literally made for the background or to get Satoru to act or into some monologuing (Yes, I threw Airi into the list too. Fuck me, right?). To address the three I counted out, Satoru's mother expressed a kind of loving connection to his son and in a way that expressed her own feelings and how much she cared for him. Yashiro, the teacher, has a special relationship with Satoru, in which he is a figure he looks up to like a father and something else which I will not mention. And Kenya, who expressed sympathy towards Satoru's goals by his own beliefs but you can say the same for a few other characters in the series. The overall storytelling was mediocre with rushed pacing and half-assed subplots which were just all over the place. It's almost as though the writers had no idea how to tell their story. Sure, they had it. But it felt like they had no idea which direction they wanted to take. For example, Kayo's mother. Her conflict came out of nowhere and was resolved in a flash after seven or so episodes of hating her. That's a pretty dumb move if I've ever seen one. And that's just only one of them. Overall, just messy messy storytelling.\\n\\n\r\nNow let's talk about the mystery and holy shit, does it suck.\\n\r\nLook, ERASED. If you're going to be a mystery, at least try to BE one. In your grand set up, you had it all, really. Mysterious kidnappings, a hidden culprit and a character determined to get to the bottom of this. But you were missing one little, teeny-tiny thing. It's called BEING A FUCKING MYSTERY. Satoru spent nearly all season connecting with Kayo and getting her as far away from the murderer as possible through the knowledge he gained. The show's first mistake, there was almost NO detective work done. What does 'detective work' mean? It means looking for clues, it means guessing, it means interpreting information and most importantly, it means HAVING SUSPECTS. Every clue and piece of information literally leads to only ONE GUY in the entire series and everyone and their mother knew immediately who the dickbag was. Where the fuck is the challenge there? Some of us even knew too early on who the culprit was! Hell, Satoru was even literally handed to him a list of suspects WITH THE CULPRIT'S NAME ON IT and what does he do!? He ignores it! Oh great! Just great! First we have no other character who could possibly fill the culprit's shoes and then you choose to IGNORE A LIST OF SUSPECTS. Well done, ERASED! Well fucking done! There's also the common excuse that Kayo's relationship was more important than the mystery as a whole but there are so many works that can handle both aspects and make them go hand-in-hand creating a truly genuine romantic mystery. Need an example? \"And Then There Were None\" by Agatha Christie. It's, like, 5 bucks on Amazon.\\n\r\nAs mentioned earlier, I have zero qualms with the art and animation as they were superb in creating the definitive atmosphere of ERASED. However, the series makes an attempt at being a metaphorical work and ultimately fails; that is, the obvious explicitness of the symbolism, conveying of themes, messages and whatnot. And these make for some pretty lame use of imagery and exposition that barely work to make its point (e.g. blue butterfly, the Last Supper shot, Airi's chocolate story, Yuuki-san's plane) or if it was trying to convey some inner meaning from them other than what the audience can see from a mile away (Spider threads). What weirded me out the most, though, was how the director kept making contradictions to the narrative. Putting tension where it doesn't belong and making the audience imply something that is completely false. To cite an example, Satoru conversing with Yuuki-san. When Satoru mentioned Kayo, suddenly, the scene became tense, Yuuki was in distress and from his body started shaking, as though he were trying to hide something. What the fuck even, ERASED. Here you are, trying to lead the viewer on when you explicitly said at the very FIRST episode that Yuuki-san was innocent, 100%. Why are you making an effort to make it look like he was the culprit!? WHY!?\\n\\n\r\nAs for the conclusion, it was as bad as one could imagine from a mystery without a mystery; a mess of conveniences brought about by, yours truly, \"Unexplained Revival\"-san and his colleagues, \"plot convenience\"-chan and \"hand touch triggers memories\"-sama along with special guest \"retarded killer motivation\"-kun.\\n\\n\r\nSo to sum it all up, while the appeal is evident and there is a very good reason for the series' popularity, as a narrative, it was underwhelming tale that was hidden under the guise of great audiovisual directing and animating; a strictly (and disappointingly) deplorable work that relied too heavily on a good story they had no idea how to tell. \\n\\n\r\n4/10",

            "content": "**SPOILER REVIEW** \r\nErased, the anime people pronounced as \u201cunique\u201d and \u201cwell written\u201d, with a \u201cgood premise.\u201d Now that I have finally watched Erased, do I consider it be overrated? Yes, yes and yes. Do I consider it to be one of the worst anime ever? Not really. I mean overall there were parts of it that I really liked, and parts of it that were extremely difficult to take seriously. If I were to outline this anime, it would be something like this: fascinating start, poor second half. Upon my initial impression, Erased appeared to be the anime of the season. It was easy tosee how this anime came up with a high rating out of nowhere on Mal's list when it wasn\u2019t finished since every episode ended with a cliffhanger.\\n\\n\r\nTime travel as a contrived/groundless plot device is hard to work with. You have to suspend your disbelief for these kinds of things. Although they never explained how his powers work, I welcomed this ability with open arms since there was a practical limitation Satoru had to work with. However, by the 2nd half of this anime, this established limitation doesn\u2019t remain consistent. The time travel power served as a cheap plot device coming up only when convenient. It shows up for no reason, doesn\u2019t show up in circumstances in which it did before, and it contradicts the restricted (but insufficiently explained) limitation. I mean seriously, how the hell does this power work. The glaring problem with time travel is that if there aren\u2019t any established rules or limitations, it transforms it into some sort of deus ex machina power that comes up only when the writer sees fit. It also fails as a mystery drama, seeing how the power is never clarified and you could probably deduce who the killer is, which in turn leads to an underwhelming reveal. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters \\n\\n\r\nThe characters were the prime issue that brought this series down for me. Satoru isn\u2019t anything groundbreaking, but I still thought his character was okay. He\u2019s the character that is defined completely by his morally virtuous attitude. There is a recurring gag that suggests some pedophilic implications, which left me creeped out at some points. Kayo could\u2019ve been a great character had they done more to show her psyche. She\u2019s constantly abused throughout this anime and instead of going into the psyche of Kayo, the abuse is just there to victimize her through cheap shock factor. In fact, the abuse scenes were so useless, they could\u2019ve been removed and it wouldn\u2019t have impacted the story at all. They could\u2019ve just shown bruises implying she was getting beaten. The main problem with her character is that she isn\u2019t a \u201creal\u201d character. She comes off more as a plot device that exists to suffer and deceive the audience that she\u2019s anything but a contrived created victim. Kayo has no psychological problems other than simply needing friends. \\n\\n\r\nThis brings up the shameless problem of how Erased handled a serious topic, child abuse. Erased loves victimizing galore. Kayo\u2019s mother is an absurdly over-malevolent character. Whenever she\u2019s on screen, you can expect her to laugh menacingly while beating her child. Saying this happens in real life does not make it any less forced. Instead of reinforcing Kayo\u2019s character, the writers aimed to make their audience feel bad for the character by showing her being violently beaten. In the end, the reasons for her abusing her child are never explained, making her bland and one-dimensional. In addition to these beating scenes, let\u2019s have Kayo be bullied at school as well. No reason to assume more victimizing won\u2019t trigger an emotional response from the viewer. \\n\\n\r\nThe killer comes in second as one of the worst characters in this anime. He started spouting off some bullshit nonsense as a poor explanation to why he kills little kids. I mean, the whole buildup and point of the mystery was why he did what he did. Instead of giving a coherent reason to why he wanted to abduct and kill children, all I got from it was that he see's a string above their heads and he killed hamsters as a kid. They tried to give empathy to the killer and kayo\u2019s mother, but only a small insight is given to their psychology of their character. Ultimately the problem with the cast was how some characters didn't act according to their age, and the motives of the villain/mother were dull or were just a big mess. It's also worth mentioning that Jun Shiratori is never heard of again. (Satoru's friend who was falsely convicted) \\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation / Sound\\n\\n\r\nNow onto the sound and the art: it was animated by A-1 Pictures. For the most part, it is done well. The show's visual and sound stayed somewhat consistent. Scenes exhibited a variety of themes, ranging from loneliness, seclusiveness, happiness, and friendship. The sound generated a nice unpropitious mood at the right times and the voice acting was adequate too. Its eerie music was exceptional, specifically during the suspenseful scenes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 6/10\\n\\n\r\nFor the first half of Erased, I was quite invested in the conflict. I wanted to see Satoru achieve his goal and the mystery behind the killer. I really enjoyed the relationship between Satoru and Kayo. The episodes that followed, however, were excruciatingly hard to watch. The quality of the visuals and soundtrack was fairly consistent, but everything else left much more to be desired. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 5/10\\n\\n\r\nErased had the potential of being a great show, but just as it grabbed my attention, it lost me halfway. The characters are dreary and the story isn't great, as it had to rely on the time travel plot device. I recommend Erased even with all the flaws. In the end, I don't think Erased is as good as some revere it to be, but I also don't think it is as bad as other people say. Please note that a 5/10 in my scale doesn\u2019t mean that it is bad, but merely I think it is average.\\n",

After watching each episode I had to stop and pace around about what would happen next, thinking about who the killer was or how the authors were going to close the series up. Although I think it became pretty obvious after a while who the killer was, I didn't even care because I wanted so much to see how the story was going to pan out. The strengths of this anime here are definitely the writing andpacing, which are excellent. Each episode leaves the viewer in suspense and feel more and more worried about the fates of the characters. This was one of those few anime in which I thought an unhappy ending was a real possibility and ended up really rooting for the protagonist's cause. The animation and voice acting are simple and familiar. There are no crazy scenes or super unique art styles, but this simplicity makes the viewer focus on the story and characters instead. I recommend this series to everyone and anyone, it is concise, complex, and totally gripping.",

For example the prominent use of red to show violence or hidden intentions was necessary at some points to contrast with the white winter scenery but most of the time it felt out of place and over saturated. As a result thetone felt inconsistent.\\n\\n\r\nThe time travel aspect was the worst part of all, it was used as a escape plan by the protagonist each time there was trouble and was immediately ignored in the ending. They  completely forgot about the capabilities of this ability towards the end of the series.\\n\\n\r\nA mystery needs to be abstract but plausible in order to be interesting.\\n\r\nThis failed by all counts.\\n\r\nSkip this unless motivated otherwise.\\n",

            "content": "Note: This is more of a \"Thoughts on\" than a review. \r\nIf you haven't heard of Boku Dake ga Inai Machi (Erased) by now, then I'm assuming that you either started anime yesterday or you don't visit biased websites that add shows onto their top 10 with only four episodes, because Erased is one of the most popular shows to come out in the past 2 years. Almost as popular as Fall 2015's One Punch Man. So with everyone praising Erased and holding it up as a flawless masterpiece, I decided to give my two cents on it.\r\nErased isn't really a bad show, but Igotta say, that it's pretty dumb. Keep in mind that I'm one that really enjoyed this show, but that doesn't mean that there aren't obvious flaws to this show. Some that I'd probably have to point out by spoiling a few things here and there, so consider this your spoiler warning.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is simple, we're presented to our 29-year-old main character named Satoru, who is a manga artist with a special ability to go back in time 1-5 minutes earlier to stop something bad from happening. How this ability works or how he got it is not told to the audience, and while you can try and defend it by saying that it would be too convoluted and stupid to explain time travel, I believe the show should set up its own rules and at least show us how he got this ability. Is he the only one with this ability? How does he even get this power? If he has a kid, will the kid have Satoru's power? Is he living in Charlotte's universe? \\n\\n\r\nWhere Erased shines is on how it's presented. It's not a bland show with uninspired shots and nothing else to grasp except for exposition; there's a lot happening on screen, and they remain to keep it that way throughout the whole show. Its direction started off pretty great at first, with a very standout atmosphere, but unfortunately, the show ends up tripping a few times with its direction and pacing. As much as I love how the first 4 episodes were done, episode 5 & 6 dropped the ball and made the show look a lot more dumb. I stopped taking this too seriously once they made up a backstory for a character getting divorced for stealing a candy bar.\\n\\n\r\nErased fails thanks to the time travel. It's not explained and it's just plot convenience. It kind of feels like the restart button every time you fail at a mission on a video game, and don't tell me that's how it works, because if so, then the ending would make no sense. His power disappeared or stopped working at the end of the show, so if that were the case, we're saying that he lived happily ever after for the rest of his life without any problems whatsoever. \\n\\n\r\nAnyways, we're told that Satoru doesn't know how to control his ability, it just goes off whenever it's convenient, but there's a scene where he's about to get arrested and he starts begging to go back in time, and for no reason, the ability listens to him and goes back in time, but then he says that this is his last revival (which is what he calls his ability). \\n\\n\r\nWhat the fuck does that mean? What do you mean he can't go back in time if he fucks up this time? How does he know this? A little bit of consistency would've been appreciated, Erased. Oh wait, he's the main character, so he obviously knows everything and we're supposed to accept it and give it a 10 without thinking about it.\\n\r\n\"No, don't think about it. It's time travel and it's too hard to understand, just accept it.\" \\n\\n\r\n The mystery in the show isn't a mystery. The killer is the most obvious killer in every mystery that I have ever watched in my life, but here's the interesting thing. I was told that this show wasn't trying to be a mystery, but more of a mystery for Satoru, and we see it unfold, as we see Satoru dealing with this problem. No matter which direction you go, it's retarded either way. I know that the whole point is that Satoru doesn't want to realize that it's the teacher, but keep in mind that Satoru is from 2006 in the 80's right now. He shouldn't be mentally retarded. If you see an adult with candy, you're most likely going to think that the guy is a child molester. It's excused that the killer would use such a clich\u00e9 tactic to get children, because this is the 80's, but it's not excused for Satoru to be retarded unless you point it out, unless you want to keep it vague like his ability (pfft). \\n\\n\r\nAlso, can anyone explain why every kid acted like they were 30, even though they were 10? Not only are they 10-year-olds, but they're also in the 80's, yet some of these kids are smarter than Satoru, who is a 29-year-old from 2006. Yes, it started off well at first with having some of the kids being fun and dumb, talking about video games and all, but that's long gone after episode 3. After that, every character is suddenly smarter than Satoru, despite being in a kid in the 80's.\\n\\n\r\nThe visual storytelling, filmmaking and editing are all quite great when compared to regular anime, but not when compared to actual artsy films, including some anime ones like Satoshi Kon's work. It shows that there was effort put into it and that it's not bland, but it's unfortunately not subtle enough to get the pass. Sure, if you're a fan of these things (like me), you'll definitely enjoy seeing it here, because it's pretty rare to see it in anime, but it's too obvious at times. There are scenes which are very clever and well crafted, one of which is from the second episode in the park scene, which if you want to look into more, I recommend you watch this great video on it by MothersBasement on Youtube, but other than that, it's mostly spelled out for you, making it feel less special as it goes on. Even the way they show us the killer is not subtle whatsoever. \\n\\n\r\nSo if you didn't know, the manga for Erased covers a lot more stuff, and thanks to this show's length, it had to cover a lot in only 12 episodes, but the ending didn't feel as rushed as I anticipated it to be, mostly because it was anime original, which is usually a bad thing, but it was surprisingly well done in this case. Of course it would've been better if it took its time with more episodes to flesh everything out, and not just cram in a lot of things in general. Still, props for not fucking up as an anime original ending.\\n\\n\r\nSo after the very obvious reveal that the teacher was the child pedo molester (may have a lot in common with Satoru), he explains his plan to Satoru like a clich\u00e9 villain, yay. Then when Satoru can't slip out of a fucking seatbelt, despite being able to escape easily, he drowns or something and wakes up 15 years later (what a fucking coincidence), and noticed that the killer was waiting for him all of these years, but unfortunately Hinazuki didn't (insert sad track). But Satoru regains his memory and stops the horny killer from... Whatever he was gonna do now, but oh no, as we all thought it was gonna end normally, Satoru finds Airi (another goddamn coincidence). He always believed. The end.\\n\\n\r\nDespite my problems with Erased, it's nowhere near a bad show; there are a lot of things that made Erased stand out, and I found myself interested in what was happening for the most part. It also looks and sounds great, plus the opening is one of the best I've seen in a while. Even though they didn't really answer everything and left a few things hanging, I enjoyed myself. Hope this show gets ERASED from existence.",

            "content": "Alright, here's my attempt at an honest objective review on one of the most hyped anime of Winter 2016, Boku Dake....ugh, I'm just going to call it Erased. Hopefully A1 Pictures will start using shorter names for their future animes. \r\nThe review will contain barely any spoiler and yes I have sat through all 12 episodes of this anime! \r\nStory: 6/10\r\nNot going to write you a synopsis because you can read the synopsis when you arrive on this page. So here's my take on it. The premise of the story starts out great. The whole idea of time travelling is used as a plot deviceand isn't explained in great detail like in Steins Gate. The director sort of purposely reveals the antagonist in the early episodes just so the show becomes more of cat and mouse game similar to Death Note. The show adapts the manga really well from episodes 1-9. Then it drops the ball and realizes they only have 3 episodes to wrap up the series. So they rush the last 3 and completely fails to include a coherent backstory to explain why this antagonist is going around murdering Lolly's. Seriously, I had to read chapter 32 of the manga just to understand the whole spiderweb analogy. The ending episode actually wrapped the series up better than the manga. Still, I feel like they wasted like 5-10 mins of unnecessary footage. I guess watching the last 3 really irked me, because I hate seeing a good potential being thrown in the trash or burned to ashes because studio gets lazy and can't time manage properly.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThe animators, editors, and all the the people involved that all worked on this anime really delivered on this anime. The animation is crisp, nicely drawn with beautiful backdrops. So beautiful you want to make them your wallpapers for a few days till you find a new anime to cheat on and use that as your backdrop. So, yes I liked the art. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThree words: Yuki F***** Kajiura! She composed the soundtrack for this anime. Take some time and just listen to it. It will help you quench that burning anger you have inside for seeing such a perfect anime with potential go to waste. The opening song is sung beautifully. It's catchy, upbeat, and shower song material. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\r\nThe characters are somewhat flushed out. The main protagonists intentions/actions are so binary and predictable. Likewise, the antagonist is so underdeveloped and lacks a good backstory. It really needs an OVA for it. I really like how the director was able to bring out the innocence and ingenuity of the kid characters. The kid characters had more character development than all the adult characters combined.  Also there is this one character who's gender is switched halfway through the anime. I suppose that's a new way to mindfuck with people or maybe the person drawing it realized they have been drawing this character in the wrong gender decided to change it to better suit the plot. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nI liked watching this anime. I still feel fans shouldn't overhype a series and rate it so high only to lose faith and rate it so poorly. I realized how it dropped the ball however this show can be enjoyed by both manga readers and anime watchers. I still feel the people who read the manga will enjoy it more than pure anime watcher since they realize the intention of the antagonists love for Lolly Hunting. Moreover, the music score and the art will help them suffer less. Since their eyes will appreciate new wallpapers they can use and their ears will bask in the glorious music of Yuki Kajiura. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nIt's good, what more do you want? I'm not going to go out of my way to rewatch it again or really recommend it to my friends to give it a watch. Well I might. I like seeing my friends cringe and suffer from time to time. I mean atleast they can enjoy the music right. \\n\\n\r\nHopefully, you enjoyed/cried reading my review. Feel free to discuss your opinions with me, I don't bite...unless you are into it...no, then I still won't bite.",

It drama for the most part in this show is mallow drama and shock factor involving a little girl being abused my her mother Because reasons.\\n\\n\r\nyet people will tell me that this is realistic and not forced in any way.\\n\r\nAlso quick question how many of you guys reading this review right now just level with me here how meany people do you know that are abusing there kids right now?\\n\r\nLike they could have done more with it instead of using it for shock factor and cheap emotional  manipulation.\\n\\n\r\nOk another problem I had with the mystery.\\n\r\nBecause as a mystery show this so this is so god dam convent when it needed to be.\\n\r\nLike for example the killer info dumped about that he was the killer and why he did it.\\n\r\nOh if you want to know why he did it I will tell you it was because why the hell not. \\n\r\nI mean one day you when your an adult you get little bored and then this idea comes to you a geat way to pass the time by killing kids you know this happens all the dam time you see it in the news so often. \\n\\n\r\nAlso there also some romance in this show.\\n\r\nThat is pretty much the text book example of paedophilia \\n\r\nWith the main protagonist being sexually attracted to a ten year old girl.\\n\r\nAnd Just because he in a ten year old body doesn't excuse it.\\n\\n\r\nOn paper it's fine just sadly it put pretty colors and presentation over actual substance and depth \\n\\n\r\nCharacters,3/10\\n\\n\r\nThe main character is as bland as toast and also comes of as a complete loser that learns nothing.\\n\r\nBecause i would actually expect a character who is an adult to have some sort of personality.\\n\\n\r\nThe side characters are one very one note. \\n\\n\r\nLike even the kid characters don't even act the like kids like when could kids psycho analysis on an adult who lives in the Internet age. I know the some children can be very smart and can pick up thing most people will miss but I don't believe that those characters are those type of children.\\n\\n\r\nAlso the Main bad guy was very disappointing as well I mean all that build up for that.\\n\r\nAnd also the main character didn't even figure out who it was Because the killer just info dumped what he was doing and his evil plans   to the main character.\\n\r\nWho at the time didn't come to the proper conclusion to  who the killer was like he was close but he still had other factors to think about before he reached the actual conclusion.\\n\r\nIt like that thing in movies where the bad guys like info dump there plan to the good guys and then the good guys stop there plan.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt,7/10\\n\\n\r\nVery well done animtion.\\n\r\nIt also fits the tone of the show with this Kind of dim color scheme and also the fact it also winter In The anime with makes it quite.\\n\r\nThe background animation is fine as well it goes very well with the whole it's winter.\\n\\n\r\nThe character  designs I quite like them.\\n\r\nBecause the kids look like real kids.\\n\\n\r\nSound, 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe opening is quite nice to listen to.\\n\r\nBut it didn't really catch my interest but I still think that quite a few people could get some enjoyment out of it.\\n\r\nThe ost is ok there are few parts that don't really fit with the whole tone of the show.\\n\r\nThe ost was done by yuki kajiura who has done the ost for sword art online and fate zero.\\n\r\nSub voice acting as ok-ish \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, 5/10\\n\\n\r\nSo the only thing I like about this show as the idea and the ost.\\n\r\nother than that I thought that this show is over hyped and i also think it doesn't deserve to be on the top ten anime list on m.a.l or any site for the matter.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, 4/10\\n\\n\r\nSo if you want to see a good example of over hype and how it can destroy a show as a whole then this will be a good show for you to watch.\\n\r\nIt also a good example of what not to do when your writing the story.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like mysteries or want to check out mystery shows.\\n\r\nthen maybe esraed would be good one timer experience,\\n\r\nBut other  than that I couldn't really recommend it.\\n",

            "content": "MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD!!! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!\r\nAh, Erased. That one anime that shot up into the top 10 out of nowhere, being rated above 9. That one anime that was so gripping, so engaging that I was absolutely sure it was a masterpiece. Everything that I saw was just \"Oh oh oh oh.... Hah... hah...\". \r\nAnd.... it's also happened to be THAT ONE anime that sucked me into a void named Catastrophe that was filled with a substance called Epic Failure.\r\nThat describes exactly how I felt after I reached the conclusion of the anime. Which is a real disappointment, as Erased had so much potentialto excel considering what was shown in episode 1. I was hyped for every episode of the first half because of how well executed it was, despite a VERY glaring plot hole/convenience on episode 1 (I think) which no one seems to notice... The anticipation I had was quite high. Sadly, the latter half never lived up to the same expectations. I was shocked that it was plagued by plot conveniences, questionable actions and horrible pacing issues. Everything that the first half prepared for was immediately brought down with this...... atrocity... Everything went wrong from episode 6-7 onwards all the way to the end.\\n\\n\r\nGiven what I've said just now, and considering the acclamation from other people, one would wonder if I'm just insane. Which, in truth, I probably am. However, there is too much biased praise going on around this and not enough actual criticism against, and I feel that some of these points need to be mentioned. Without further ado, let's get into it.\\n\\n\r\nMAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD!!! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nART - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSOUND - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nUndoubtedly, these 2 are the show's strongest point. The art is just below the level of Shinkai's recent work, Your Name. There is a huge amount of effort that went into the artwork, and it shows. The level of detail that can be seen  (vivid use of colours, refined animation etc..) is exquisite. There's this particular scene where the 2 protagonists stood underneath a tree under the aurora (?) lights, which I love. That scene is absolutely breathtaking. They have also dipped into darker colours for darker moods, which adds to that atmosphere. My only complaint would be the lack of shading on some of the characters (light source) in broad daylight which gives them a 'flat' look no matter where they looked. Overall, this is a minor complaint. The artwork is well done for the most part, and remains consistently so through the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe sounds is another strong suite, which plays a major contribution to the atmosphere without the series. They've made good use of it. The opening song is alright, though not memorable for me since it's not up to my tastes.\\n\\n\r\nPLOT - 6/30\\n\\n\r\n(Part one)\\n\\n\r\n\"Just get this anime Erased from your memory as fast as they Erased their rules\"\\n\\n\r\nThat quote pretty much sums up the main problem with the plot. Unfortunately, this show were riddled with small problems that were accumulated into something too big to be fixed in the latter half. Let me explain.\\n\\n\r\nWe get introduced to the main protagonist Satoru, a 29 year-old mangaka who, for some unknown reason, gains the ability to *gasp* travel back in time... Where have I seen this failure before...?\\n\\n\r\nDon't get me wrong here. Everyone loves time travelling, as do I, and as such, would be heavily invested in anime that contains such power. It does allow for many interesting situations and solutions to arise due to the 'butterfly effect' - chasing the past will always change the future somehow. A simplified example would be something along the lines of this - go back in time to prevent event A from happening using method B. Doesn't work, go back, use method C and so on. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, it is ridiculously prone to be used purely as a plot convenience, often going back in time to prevent the protagonist's death at a convenient time. This problem is exacerbated if it can not be 'controlled' and only done 'randomly'. This event is called a 'bullshit moment', as much as Fairy Tail's writing of preventing deaths. To prevent this, they often restrict the usage/activation of time travelling to specific scenarios. The more restrictions there are and the more detailed they are, the more specific the scenario is and as a result, the higher the chances of avoiding the 'bullshit moment'//lesser the chances of a random throwback occurring.\\n\\n\r\nStein's Gate, a well known anime for its use of time travelling, uses a perfect set of restrictions for said power/phenomenon:\\n\\n\r\n1. Requires the devices to actually even start going back in time (D-Mail and the Phone Microwave as well as that memory transportation device. Sorry about my poor memory)\\n\\n\r\n2. Requires an attendant who can operate the said devices (Makise Kurisu and Hasida Itaru)\\n\\n\r\n3. Requires a specific time/co-ordinate to be set (Memory machine)\\n\\n\r\nThose restrictions immediately eliminate any form of abuse by plebeians. The power is restricted solely towards the said devices - that power is not found innately in people, like Subaru from Re:Zero. Those devices are also tangible as a result of being something physical, not innate. It is entirely under control of the attendants, who also needed to specify the time. That's a PRETTY specific scenario that perfectly eliminates the bullshit moments.\\n\\n\r\nIn Erased, the following restrictions are:\\n\\n\r\n1. Satoru can only be sent back in time JUST BEFORE SOMETHING OCCURS\\n\\n\r\n2. Satoru may only be sent back 1 to 5 minutes in time just before the incident to prevent it\\n\\n\r\n3. Satoru may not have control over this ability\\n\\n\r\nSo, those restrictions mean that the scenarios required for activation are less specific than that of Stein's Gate, thus it can be activated more frequently. However, this is still a good limitation. It still prevents any form of**voluntary** abuse. It requires him being close to someone who is either about to or have other bad things happen to that person, and he can't get back too far - just far enough to prevent the death of said person. However, the 3rd restriction is a double edged sword, and can be treated as a mere plot device if forgotten, or used incorrectly. Such as having your family about to die then going back in time.\\n\\n\r\nWith all that in mind, you would expect that those restrictions would be carried consistently through the show, right? Right?\\n\\n\r\nNo. Just... no... There were 2 instances where the restrictions were completely flushed down the toilet after being dissolved in acid. And unfortunately, those 2 instances had major repercussions in the direction of the anime, which created the monstrosity in the latter half, all thanks to that 3rd restriction of having no control.\\n\\n\r\nThe first instance occurred AS EARLY AS EPISODE 1, when he was took a trip back in time to when he was a kid, 14 years of age. That's a whopping difference of 15 YEARS. That's more than 1000000 times the restricted amount suggests - 7.884 * 10^6 to be exact. The mother's death also occurred PAST the point of 'before something happens'. Coincidence? I think not. That time travel aspect was used merely as a plot device.\\n\\n\r\nThe second instance occurred later during the series, when shouting 'GO BACK\" or something apparently allows him to to travel BACK in time AGAIN for the same amount of years -_-\\n\\n\r\nBULLSHIT MOMENTS RIGHT THERE GUYS :3\\n\\n\r\nHopefully that explains the quote above. They forgot their own rules that they set out that quickly on episode 1.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, enough about the time travelling aspect gone wrong, let's move into the actual story line. Hopefully it won't be as b----- No. It's still a trainwreck. As I mentioned above, because of the time travel aspect going wrong, the rest of the story line suffered. I'll continue more as the problem seems to be on the characterisation, which I should cover before continuing.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERISATION - 7/30\\n\\n\r\nI find that their characterisation is quite weak, and contributed to the downfall of the plot. Considering the setting and the plot, you would expect the characters to be realistic, more human-like, similar to Ghost in the Shell - Stand Alone Complex. Unfortunately, this is FAR, far from reality. There are a multitude of problems here, from the lackluster motives of the antagonist to the lackluster development of the characters to the actions of said characters that don't match up according to their age. Those 3 are what I find to be the main forces that made the plot pendulum swing in the wrong direction.\\n\\n\r\nFirst, let's get started on our little gang, which consists of:\\n\\n\r\n- Satoru\\n\\n\r\n- Hinazuki Kayo\\n\\n\r\n- Ken'ya\\n\\n\r\n- A trap\\n\\n\r\n- 2 useless boys\\n\\n\r\nWe have Satoru, the main protagonist, that embodies that 'Hero of Justice' ideology, or whatever it is. He wants to save everyone just for the sake of saving everyone. There's no reason/rationale behind it. He just wanted to be the hero ever since he was young . Basically, he's the Emiya Shirou of Erased. No feelings, no chance of development, nothing. Just a blank slate that adjusts to the direction of the narrative as necessary. This is horrifically evident when he tries to get himself further involved by protecting another female.... For, again, no reason whatsoever. No motive.\\n\\n\r\nHinazuki is a victim of child abuse, who later grows up and lives a happy life by marrying to the trap. In the meantime, during the elementary fiasco, she slowly opens up to the gang, becoming much more social. Though her development was uninteresting, it's STILL developement. Her personality changes from being closed, glum and asocial to a more cheerful, thankful and social person. Perhaps the only one that did receive development...\\n\\n\r\nKen'ya is the smart dude in the gang, having an IQ of 140+ at such a young age. He wants to become an accomplice for Satoru's 'Hero of Justice' just because. Again, there's not much reason, other than that he is Satoru's friend and that he sensed that he's stressed out. There's no proper motive. I was hoping that he would receive some development, but just like Satoru, and the rest of the characters, he's a blank slate.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have the villain with the most lackluster characterisation in the entire series. Seriously, all I remember from the anime was that he sees people as hamsters with strings attached to them, calling them 'Spice' while facing abuse from his brother in the past. What kind of villain is that? It screams that he just kills people for the sake of killing people for that spicy life... \\n\\n\r\nI mean, when Satoru was in a coma, he even stopped killing.... what? Out of nowhere, he decided to not kill other people because it's not fun anymore? Nice plot device right here...\\n\\n\r\nThe trap and the 2 friends are just there... I have no memories of them.\\n\\n\r\nWhew, with that done, let's get back to the plot.\\n\\n\r\nPLOT - (PART 2)\\n\\n\r\nSo, we've established that the time travel aspect was a mess. Now, let's look at the actual plot. I'm not going to spew much of the synopsis, because it's been said in the other reviews. What I WILL say is that it's riddled with... plot conveniences... Here is a summary of some plots at work from memory:\\n\\n\r\n1. If he were to go back in time to his younger self, after his mum dies, logic follows through that Satoru would investigate the murderer. So, what on earth was he thnking of when he decided that it's better to befriend a lonely girl? Did he really want her ass that badly?\\n\\n\r\n2. Why did he run away from the crime scene? He was innocent. The only proof against him are circumstantial evidence - ONE witness saw blood on his hands... Fibre analysis and fingerprint analysis would indicate that he was not the one who held the knife. He also had a STRONG alibi against it as at least 3 people saw him leaving his night shift, the time when his mum got murdered. So..... him running away just increases suspicion...\\n\\n\r\n3. He somehow remembered that the teacher was the killer from fingers tapping... Not like other people pretty much do the same thing... It makes no sense. I'm sure amnesia doesn't work like that. It's not significant enough to actually remember it... The manga at least made some sense when they used Airi, if that's her name, to help trigger his memory, because she was significant enough.\\n\\n\r\n4. Not sure why the killer didn't change targets right on the get-go if things were starting to get out of hand...\\n\\n\r\n5. Not sure why after saving Hinazuki, he continued to involve himself further into saving everyone.... Emiya Shirou at its finest...\\n\\n\r\n6. How on earth does he get this power? Was he gifted the power of time by Chronos? If there is one?\\n\\n\r\nAbove all, especially during the latter half, the episodes felt rushed. It went through event after event after event too quickly that it doesn't feel like any time is dedicated towards development of the characters... At all... It also tried to go straight to the point but in doing so, they skipped some events which I felt could have bridged the flow of the plot. Right now, it's too staggered and too fast.\\n\\n\r\nThe conclusion leaves much to be desired. Power of friendship.\\n\\n\r\nEDIT: I just realised I did not explain point 1 as originally planned. Which is odd, since I thought I did...\\n\\n\r\nAs I said, for the plot's sake, Saturo chose to save Hinazuki at 'all costs', or 'within his power' from death as he KNOWS that she will die. If this was a separate plot that works side by side with the main 'catch the murderor', it would have been fine. This isn't the case. In fact, the latter plot felt like an afterthought. The major plot at work is saving Hinazuki from death where the cause if it is unknown at the time of the proclamation. And unfortunately, this had the effect of:\\n\\n\r\n- Warping the narrative so much through plot holes, plot conveniences and horribly weak characterisation that Hinazuki's death was somehow related to the murderer.\\n\\n\r\n- Twisting the decision making of the main protaognist, Satoru, to the point that he prioritises saving Hinazuki over catching the murderer of his mother. \\n\\n\r\nThe entire show was crafted around this plot. Expect to see illogical choices made everywhere...\\n\\n\r\nFINAL THOUGHTS - 7/20\\n\\n\r\n- Enjoyed the first half, but died off during the second half\\n\\n\r\n- Absolutely failed as a mystery anime. It's quite obvious considering the evidence who the killer is. The lack of a 'red herring' emphasised on this. There's no 'dummy' target that they use to trick us. It's obvious.\\n\\n\r\n- Absolutely failed as a thriller. \\n\\n\r\nTOTAL SCORE - 37/100 37% = 4/10 on MAL",

            "content": "Review in english and portuguese/resenha em ingl\u00eas e portugu\u00eas:\r\nEnglish version (contains spoilers):\r\nThe protagonist (Satoru) is a traumatized and failed adult, (many can identify and become attached to him) who can not lead the life ahead by being hostage of a tragedy of his childhood, but he has a great power without explanation and logic that allows him to \"go back to the past\" and set things, in the beginning, Satoru's power worked only in a short space time, but this power allowed him to return to his childhood and try to avoid that tragedy. Sounds good, right? Wrong!\r\nSuch a tragedy was the murder of aschoolmate (Kayo) of Satoru, the \"culprit\" was an acquaintance of the protagonist, he believed that he was innocent (he was) and lived imprisoned to that, until one day, the mother Satoru was killed by the real culprit, the anime reveals characteristics of the killer and were the same characteristics the teacher that the protagonist had in childhood, the anime began to spoil at this point, it was always obvious who was to blame, the direction left everything explicit , there were no other concrete suspects and they still try to \"cheat\" us by showing him as the \"good guy\", the show becomes bizarre, even more so by leaving him \"obscure\" through the direction, when he revealed himself as the villain, becomes more bizarre, he was totally unilateral. He looks like the villains of Akame ga kill, that is, generic, stereotyped, a very bad guy, resembling villains from the 80s. The eyes turn red when someone is going to do some \"badness.\"\\n\\n\r\nThe anime had a slow pace in the beginning, but it was cool to see the interaction of the characters, but for a short time, the way the murder was avoided, showed that it did not need that amount of time used until half, then accelerated the final stretch , finally, after the protagonist managed to \"save\" the girl, he ended up in a coma, due to the stupid script exit in which the Professor literally throws the car in the river, to make matters worse, the Professor had to reveal himself as the evil killer, because the protagonist wasted time \"playing\" with the girl, instead of focusing entirely on finding out who the killer was.\\n\\n\r\nSomething else, children do not act like children, an example, the blondie (Kenya) is the smartest of the whole anime, but his reasoning sounds more like a convenience to the plot than a natural feature of the character, \\n\r\nsomething that undermined the show even more. Kayo's mother, she was too cruel, on a stupid level and the show try to justify this with the abuses she suffered from her husband, a clear flaw in the attempt to create something realistic. The Kayo also had a cold and mature behavior, but applied in an exaggerated way, totally out of a child's behavior, a serious anime need not want to turn children into \"adults\", Madoka Magica is a good example of this, the magical girls behave in a manner consistent with their ages, even the most mature of them had their maturity justified in a manner acceptable to that context.\\n\\n\r\nBack in adult life, Satoru was finally able to start a new life, but the teacher returns and together they play a final \"parodying Parasyte\", but in a much worse way, it became funny the way they tried to impress us with something who tried to be \"smart\", but that ended up being a great nonsense, to fall on top of that \"mattress\" was the pitiful. Finally, the anime ends up with an immature message: \"Live with traumas of the past, go back in time and arrange things to move on\", episode 11 of Fate / Zero refutes this idea, the form that Saber was humiliated by wanting to change the past refutes the central idea of \u200b\u200bErased, we have to accept that we can not change the past, we need to face the present and overcome our traumas in the present, we can cry, we can mourn, but we must accept that the past can not be changed. Erased was an anime that took itself too seriously and ended with a super cowardly message, totally escaped from a realistic message, so utopian, it has become idiotic and unfounded.\\n\\n\r\nErased tries to get you only on the emotional side, we have to completely turn off the brain to like it, I could even do it if it were a nonsense anime, like Excel Saga or Kakegurui, but Erased does not fit this pattern, so I can not ignore it certain idiocy. The best thing about Erased is the animation, (the soundtrack is good too) but they force the bar in the direction, as in the red eyes, the camera angles in the Professor and the shadows in him. Satoru's power was not explained, I want to reinforce it, he just had it, he does not follow any logic, the power ends up working in different ways in the series and we do not know why, it was not necessary to explain the origin, but at least follow some logic. The power of Satoru acts in different ways as the script needs to move forward.\\n\\n\r\nIt would be more interesting if Satoru failed to save Kayo, return to the present and solve things the right way, Erased turned out to be an anime with a cowardly ending, as well as having delivered its main points from the beginning.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nVers\u00e3o em portugu\u00eas (Cont\u00e9m spoilers):\\n\\n\r\nO protagonista (Satoru) \u00e9 um adulto traumatizado e fracassado, (muitos podem se identificar e se afei\u00e7oar a ele) que n\u00e3o consegue levar a vida em frente por ser ref\u00e9m de uma trag\u00e9dia de sua inf\u00e2ncia, mas ele tem um grande poder sem explica\u00e7\u00e3o e l\u00f3gica alguma, que o permite \"voltar ao passado\" e arrumar as coisas, a princ\u00edpio, era em um curto espa\u00e7o de tempo, mas esse poder permitiu a ele voltar para a sua inf\u00e2ncia e tentar evitar aquela trag\u00e9dia. Parece bom, n\u00e9? Errado! \\n\\n\r\nTal trag\u00e9dia foi o assassinato de uma colega de escola (Kayo) do Satoru, o tal \"culpado\" era um conhecido do protagonista, ele acreditava que ele era inocente (era mesmo) e vivia aprisionado a isso, at\u00e9 que certo dia, a m\u00e3e do Satoru foi morta pelo verdadeiro culpado, o anime revela caracter\u00edsticas do assassino e as caracter\u00edsticas batem com o professor que o protagonista tinha na inf\u00e2ncia, o anime come\u00e7ou a se estragar nesse ponto, sempre foi \u00f3bvio quem era o culpado, a dire\u00e7\u00e3o deixou tudo expl\u00edcito, n\u00e3o haviam outros suspeitos concretos e ainda tentam nos \"enganar\"  mostrando-o como o \"bonzinho\", chega a ser bizarro, ainda mais por deixarem ele \"obscuro\" atrav\u00e9s da dire\u00e7\u00e3o, quando ele revelou-se como o vil\u00e3o, ficou ainda mais bizarro, ele era totalmente unilateral. Ele se parece com os vil\u00f5es de Akame ga kill, ou seja, gen\u00e9rico, estereotipado e cartoonesco, um cara muito mau, parecido com vil\u00f5es dos anos 80. Os olhos ficam vermelhos quando algu\u00e9m vai fazer alguma \"malvadeza\". \\n\\n\r\nO anime tinha um ritmo lento no come\u00e7o, mas era legal ver a intera\u00e7\u00e3o dos personagens, s\u00f3 que por pouco tempo, a forma como o assassinato foi evitado, mostrou que n\u00e3o precisava daquela quantia de tempo usada at\u00e9 a metade, depois aceleraram a reta final, por fim, depois de o protagonista conseguir \"salvar\" a garota, ele acabou ficando em coma, por conta da sa\u00edda de roteiro idiota em que o Professor literalmente joga o carro no rio, para piorar, o Professor teve que revelar-se como o assassino maldoso, pois o protagonista perdeu tempo \"brincando\" com a garota, ao inv\u00e9s de focar-se totalmente em descobrir quem era o assassino. \\n\\n\r\nOutra coisa, as crian\u00e7as n\u00e3o agem como crian\u00e7as, um exemplo, o loirinho (Kenya) \u00e9 o mais inteligente do anime todo, mas o racioc\u00ednio dele soa mais como uma conveni\u00eancia para o andamento da trama do que uma caracter\u00edstica natural do personagem, outra coisa que prejudicou o anime, foi a m\u00e3e da Kayo, ela era cruel demais, a um n\u00edvel escrachado e tentam justificar isso com os abusos que ela sofria de seu c\u00f4njuge, uma clara falha na tentativa de criar algo realista. A Kayo tamb\u00e9m tinha um comportamento frio e maduro, mas aplicados de uma forma exagerada, totalmente fora do comportamento de uma crian\u00e7a, um anime s\u00e9rio n\u00e3o precisa querer transformar as crian\u00e7as em \"adultos\", Madoka Magica \u00e9 um bom exemplo disso, as garotas m\u00e1gicas se comportam de forma condizente com suas idades, at\u00e9 mesmo a mais madura delas teve a sua maturidade justificada de uma forma aceit\u00e1vel \u00e0quele contexto. \\n\\n\r\nDe volta a vida adulta, Satoru p\u00f4de finalmente recome\u00e7ar sua vida, mas o Professor volta e juntos eles protagonizam um final \"parodiando o de Parasyte\", s\u00f3 que de uma maneira bem pior, chegou a ser engra\u00e7ada a forma que tentaram nos impressionar com algo que tentou ser \"inteligente\", mas que acabou sendo uma grande bobagem, cair em cima daquele \"colch\u00e3o\" foi o lament\u00e1vel. Por fim, o anime acaba passando uma mensagem imatura: \"viva com traumas do passado, volte no tempo e arrume as coisas para seguir em frente\", o epis\u00f3dio 11 de Fate/Zero refuta essa ideia, a forma que a Saber foi humilhada por querer mudar o passado refuta a ideia central de Erased, temos que aceitar que n\u00e3o podemos mudar o passado, precisamos encarar o presente e superar nossos traumas no presente, podemos chorar, nos lamentar, mas devemos aceitar que o passado n\u00e3o pode ser mudado. Erased foi um anime que levou-se a s\u00e9rio demais e terminou com uma mensagem super covarde, fugiu totalmente de uma mensagem realista, de t\u00e3o ut\u00f3pico, tornou-se idiota e infundado. \\n\\n\r\nErased tenta pegar-te apenas pelo lado emocional, temos que desligar totalmente o c\u00e9rebro para gostar, eu at\u00e9 poderia fazer isso se fosse um anime escrachado, como Excel Saga ou Kakegurui, mas Erased n\u00e3o se encaixa nesse padr\u00e3o, por isso n\u00e3o tenho como ignorar certas idiotices. A melhor coisa de Erased \u00e9 a anima\u00e7\u00e3o, (a trilha sonora tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 boa) mas for\u00e7am a barra na dire\u00e7\u00e3o, como nos olhos vermelhos, os \u00e2ngulos de c\u00e2mera no Professor e as sombras no mesmo. O poder do Satoru n\u00e3o foi explicado, quero refor\u00e7ar isso, ele apenas o tinha, n\u00e3o segue l\u00f3gica alguma, o poder acaba funcionando de maneiras diferentes na s\u00e9rie e a gente n\u00e3o sabe o porqu\u00ea, n\u00e3o era necess\u00e1rio explicar a origem, mas ao menos devia seguir alguma l\u00f3gica. O poder de Satoru atua de diferentes formas conforme o roteiro precisa avan\u00e7ar. Seria mais interessante se o Satoru falhasse em salvar a Kayo, voltasse ao presente e resolvesse as coisas da maneira correta, Erased se mostrou um anim\u00ea com um final covarde, al\u00e9m de ter entregado seus pontos principais desde o come\u00e7o.",

            "content": "I've been thinking really hard about this one. I am aware of the fact that this series has met some heavy backlash at the hands of a lot of audiences and, as always, others of the \"Elitist\" type. \r\nMy opinion: Boku dake ga Inai Machi (ERASED) is one of the best Anime ever made. At first I thought myself stupid for buying all 11 episodes for the \"low\" price of $275 courtesy of Rightstuf. While that declaration may still hold quite a bit of water, I do not. regret it for a second. The story of Erased is just that, a story (a great oneat that). I opens, establishes characters, follows a plot and ends in another place. A structure that, while not the most original, still works. A classic is a classic for a reason and if it ain't broke, don't fix it. We follow a 29 year-old manga artist as his mind is sent back into his ten year-old body in order to not only solve but prevent a string of murders surrounding his age group. I won't talk too much about the plot but I will say I can't remember a moment in the series when I wasn't Invested. Erased Builds the story and interactions around the characters forming a world so beautiful I couldn't help but love. \\n\r\nNow to address the elephant in the room, the ending is perfect. I even like it more than the manga ending. Again, no spoilers but damn. Erased is one of my favourite shoes ever. It may not be something for you, but it was for me.",

            "content": "\"The Town Where Only I am Missing\" (loosely turned into \"Erased\" in the English version), has many amazing aspects, yet with it's rushed pace and incredible amount of unexplained occurrences, it is one that has me feeling a confused love for this show. If it was trying to make me go read the manga to get the full and possibly better version of this story, then it certainly succeeded as that's what I'm going to be doing soon.\r\nDespite being an excellent series (in my opinion), it is a rather predictable one; I won't try to hide that. From just my first time watching the openingsequence of the show, I had already taken a guess at who the murderer would be, and though I sometimes doubted that guess during the series, I ended up being exactly right.\\n\\n\r\nErased is a mystery series chronicling the desperate attempts of the 29 year old failing manga artist named Satoru to try to prevent his entire world from falling apart. Satoru has a power called \"Revival.\" It is a power that he cannot control, and is honestly less of a power and more like a deja-vu feeling. He gets this feeling whenever something bad is going to happen around him, and after he gets this feeling, he tries to desperately find out what is going to go wrong and try to solve the incident.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, when Satoru's world falls apart right before his very eyes (well technically he got there like 5 minutes afterwards), his Revival power takes on a new form allowing him to travel through time to his childhood when the series of events that led to the tragedy that is facing his adult self all began. Here's the first issue with the series: Revival. Actually this is probably the biggest issue with the series. Revival is a strange thing in this series as it is shown twice in the first episode before Satoru travels back in time as a deja-vu-like sensation. Then it allows him to travel through time occasionally during the rest of the series, but it never occurs again in the simple deja-vu way ever again after the first episode. And it's never said why at all.\\n\\n\r\nAs for other plot problems, they mainly come from a lack of explanation, specifically in the second half of the show where A LOT of things are apparently cut out in order to make this series into a 12 episode show instead of 20-some episode show.\\n\\n\r\nI've been dissing this series a lot so far, but I rated it a 8/10 (and I don't give that rating to all that many series), so why the rating? Aside from those issues, I thought the rest of the story was actually brilliant. Each episode ties nicely into the next, keeping you invested. I watched the whole series in two days (one day after the seventh episode was aired, and then again after the series was finished). This is not the kind of series you can just watch whenever. It drags you in and makes you crave more. It's a mystery that, despite being pretty sure who the villain was from early on, I still was enthralled by.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I don't think any characters in this series (well maybe Satoru's mom) are stand-out, amazing characters on their own, what makes the characters in Erased so memorable and fun to watch are their interactions with other characters. Satoru's relationships grow in incredible ways. With his adult brain inside the body of a middle schooler, he is capable of interacting with others around him much differently than he could the first time. However, what I liked about this aspect is that the series still doesn't make him seem like he knows everything. In fact, he learns a lot even about his friends, his mom, and other people he thought he knew well before. This allows him to grow through constant trials that test his willpower and his wits. I only wish there was more time for the characters to have grown. The character however that got shirked the most by the short series was actually not Satoru or Kayo (the primary person Satoru is trying to save in the past), but actually the antagonist. \\n\\n\r\n[Well some characters just got dropped out of the show along the way so there were actually quite a few characters who needed more time, but they aren't quite as important anyway].\\n\\n\r\nThis is one of the parts that had me the most conflicted about the series (second after the Revival confusion). The antagonist in this series is most certainly an amazing antagonist, but he gets the short end of the stick with this series that didn't do him quite enough justice. From the very first episode, he gives off an incredibly menacing and mysterious demeanor and you just want to know more about him. He may be fairly obvious, but that doesn't make it any less spectacular when the big reveal finally comes towards the end. But that's just it... it comes towards the end; then the villain is given time to develop a little, but there is so much else happening while the series is trying to wrap up that it just feels so rushed and you just want to learn more about him. That is, it's rushed up until the final scene. The final scene is brilliantly executed and I could not have thought of a more fitting way to end the series. So at least that was done right in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nOne other thing I want to mention relating to the characters is the handling of child abuse in this series. It was used a little too much to create drama in this series, and as someone dating a girl who has been abused and hearing her reactions to this show's portrayal as well as my own opinions on the topic, I can say it definitely has a bit of an \"anime-like\" approach to the subject that isn't really a good portrayal of how it is in real life, but it certainly isn't the worst case. It is handled much better than in some shows where it is extremely over-exaggerated for the sole purpose of making us sympathize with a character, though in some ways it is just kind of a plot point to move the story. So it wasn't handled too poorly or too well. Like most aspects of this show, it really just needed more time to be explored.\\n\\n\r\nWhat really sold the series for me and was my favorite aspect of Erased by far was it's atmosphere. The mix of amazing animation and a beautiful soundtrack with OP and ED songs that fit the series perfectly just completely immersed me in this beautiful, yet simplistic world. It just takes place in a small town and another town in Satoru's present day, yet it creates such a beautiful atmosphere that you forget these places are literally no different than any other town you'd see in anime or honestly even just in the real world. The use of repeated scenery shots of many different places (such as seeing the front of the school, the park, outside Kayo's house) left you feeling like you lived there and knew the town just like the characters did. It has this wonderful mysterious feeling to it all that helps tie together the beautiful atmosphere and the mysterious tone of the show and uses it for excellent world building.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the crap out of Erased. That's basically what I feel now that I've just finished it about an hour ago. Yes it has problems with certain aspects like its rushed pace, lack of explanations, and some character issues mainly in the way that things were cut too short for some characters to get enough development.\\n\\n\r\nBut what Erased really excels at is its wondrous and mysterious atmosphere created through the excellent soundtrack and the beautiful animation that really entices you to want to watch more, and it's character interactions. Satoru is not a bad main character, but it certainly does help that all the other characters have such great interactions with him. I especially loved his connection with the antagonist, but his relationships with Kayo, Kenya, and his mother are also excellently executed and the changes they go through are what really drives the series and makes it fun to watch.",

Then we'll just sit  back and watch the money pile up at our virtuous feet. After this, we'll add in a bunch of diverging plot threads that lead to nowhere, replace logic with coincidences, insert unnecessary characters so they can do unnecessary things + include a mystery that even OJ Simpson could solve.\\n\r\n>woah...r u a genius?\\n\\n\r\n~short summary of Erased from Jan 8th to March 25th.\\n\\n\r\n(A)STORY\\n\\n\r\n(1)Time Travel\\n\\n\r\nTime Travel wasn't always such a frightening theme to approach. Back in 1895, the world was introduced to a story that would focus on both events in the past + the future, with H.G. Wells' Time Machine. Time Travel, at it's core, is essentially centered around 'changing history',  and how it will alter the future when everything is said and done.\\n\r\nThe world of anime was introduced to/made aware of Time Travel through popular titles such as The Girl Who Leapt Through Time, Steins;Gate, The Melancholy Of Haruhi Suzumiya, Madoka Magica + Future Diary..bleh.\\n\r\nOne would assume, if not careful, that the theme of Time Travel would always appear as creative, exciting, endearing + mysterious.\\n\r\nNowadays, if one doesn't make something that is a unique, original, different, fresh, innovative snowflake it is forever lost in the depths of space along with Emilio Estevez + Brendan Fraser.  \\n\r\nLike them or not, most of the above anime titles managed to do something, that while not as unique as Mad Eye Moody's..uh..I mean!...Forest Whitaker's hereditary condition known as Ptosis, that had never been done before in anime. However, there is one anime...one product...one myth...one bad ass...one proxy...one entity...that has become so controversial throughout the anime community, it is as if Jesus Christ himself came down from heaven and spoke only these words....\"Praise be to Allah\".\\n\r\nThe extraterrestrial being that I speak of is, of course, Boku dake ga Inai Machi, otherwise known as Erased.  How does this benevolent god hold up in terms of Time Travel in anime, you ask? Well.........\\n\\n\r\nA mundane story, with a  severe lack of direction + memorability would be about as good as it gets. When I said that it was essential for an anime to utilize Time Travel in a fresh + unique way, I really meant it.  Here, despite how difficult it is, in this day + age, to add anything new to Time Travel, there is not even an ATTEMPT made to make it seem less generic + dull.  The anime just settles for \"go back in time to save someone\". You would assume that DESPITE no visible effort or care given to Time Travel at all, that they would at least EXPLAIN how it works? No. You f*ckin' wouldn't. And whoop de f*ckin doo, there is NONE. Episode after episode, I would wait patiently for an explanation. At this point I would have accepted a LOST explanation, but no. They treat this like its the bubonic plague or something, but honestly all I'm asking for is a bit of depth + a sign that you actually CARE about what you're writing + not exploiting Time Travel as a mere plot device. In conclusion, in terms of how Erased handles + treats Time Travel in it's story.....VERY POOR\\n\\n\\n\r\n(2)Mystery\\n\\n\r\nNow, don't worry, I know that this story has two sides to it. One being the Time Travel + the other being the Mystery side of it. While the Time Travel can seen as the backbone of Erased, the part that supports + keeps the story from falling apart, the Mystery can be seen as the real meat of the story, basically the sh*t that most people actually care about. \\n\r\nLuckily, with the Mystery genre, it doesn't matter how you write it, why you're writing it, what you do with it or where you take the story. Mystery is unique, in way that it doesn't matter how badly the story ends up, all that matters is WHO DID IT. Despite how repetitive it gets, people are almost always trying to figure out who the 'killer' is. Why? The average viewer just sits + watches without any input or connection to the program they're watching. When given the chance to feel like they're actively taking part in the show, the average viewer will jump at the chance to become apart of the show itself. To this day, the Mystery genre remains one of the best ways to get your audience emotionally invested in your story. ALL THAT MATTERS is that the 'killer' at the end is both uncalled for + rewarding to the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nWith that being said, let's put on our deerstalkers + try to figure out who the killer is. Remember what I said, choosing who you're killer is CRITICAL, it can both MAKE + DESTROY the series.\\n\\n\r\nAppearance of the Suspect\\n\r\n(1) male adult\\n\r\n(2) light skin\\n\r\n(3) black hair\\n\\n\r\nOkay..Let's see here, hmmm...a male adult? Not many of those around in the anime...I can think of one though...hahahah...imagine if it was him....wait...hold on did you say black hair? hmmmm....not many of those around in the anime...I can think of one though....hahaha....imagine if it was him...this anime is full of racist b*stards, so there is no such thing as black..God could you imagine if it was him? I mean...hahaha...ummm...wait...that makes sense...they...they wouldn't....\\n\r\n~Your reaction when you identified the killer as fast as you identified Hitler\\n\\n\r\n*It's important to note that I am in no way trying to spoil this anime, this is LITERALLY the basic physical description we were provided from the first episode*\\n\\n\r\nAlas, while the end reveal is typically the most crucial part of any Mystery, we must not forget to include the build-up, how it handles it's pacing, etc. \\n\r\nWhile the beginning of this show isn't astounding by any means, it is reasonably well paced + directed with a clear objective in mind. Prevent the death of a former school mate, Kayo, in order to figure out who murdered the MC's mother. Basically, the MC's mother was stabbed by the 'killer' + she had already guessed it was him because....well...you see...and MC ran away from the police even though he had a great relationship with his mother because...well...you see... and the MC was sent back just like a month or two to figure out who the killer was...or maybe it was a bit longer...just like 18 YEARS or something...Wait couldn't MC just go back like a week or maybe a month to solve the mys-STOP ASKING LOGICAL QUESTIONS + LOOK OVER THERE, KAYO IS SMILING!...Do you remember when I brought up the fact that the Time Travel is like just plain f*cked? Well...let's just say it has it's repercussions, along with a confusing sense of direction + overall sense of purpose.\\n\r\nBecause of this, while we should be trying to enjoy this anime for what it is, we are constantly questioning things like logic + reason. If I could describe it, as wittily as I can, it's like having a Q&A with Donald Trump and expecting answers other than,\"Make america great again, I'm ahead in the polls, I have four f*ckin' billion dollars\", or in this case,\" This will never be Erased from my memory, Best anime of 2016 because..reasons, Satoru x Kayo\". \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, while I do believe that there was a general idea + focus for the story during the beginning, the story that branches from episode 1 all the way up to episode 12 is full of so much inconsistency that it barely manages to avoid ending up as an incoherent mess. Even AFTER the show's immensely underwhelming + predictable reveal towards the end, I still planned on going easy on Erased + awarding it with with an AVERAGE story rating. BUT...that is until i witnessed the show's final 2 episodes...which are so sloppily + carelessly written that they might as well be detached from the rest of the series.  I, almost reluctantly, award this show's use of Mystery with an overall score of...VERY POOR.\\n\\n\r\n(B)CHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\n(1)Main Cast\\n\\n\r\nOur two protagonists of the story are Satoru, a man-child who has difficulty expressing his emotions, and Kayo, a  \u0336m\u0336a\u0336n\u0336 child who has difficulty expressing  \u0336h\u0336i\u0336s\u0336   her emotions. Now, I'm NOT saying that this is a BAD thing, or that it necessarily drops their rating in a drastic way, I simply feel that when two main characters are put together with too similar personalities, feelings such as intrigue or interest aren't as present as they should be. While it is easily noticeable that Satoru's cold + distant personality is well overused, I can't really critique this for being just straight up bad, but it certainly doesn't make him stand out as different or interesting. Unfortunately, Satoru also appears to still act like a child, despite being twenty nine years old. I'm NOT talking about when he hangs around with his friends or talks to his mother.\\n\r\nI'm talking about the various decisions he makes over the course of this twelve episode series, like trusting pretty much EVERY character in the show + deciding to solve the mystery all by himself. You'd think that a twenty nine year old would take things a little more seriously, considering the fact that he's trying to save his own mother. He DOES actually develop at least a little bit in the show, and therefore I can't consider him a truly awful character + tend to view him as more of an AVERAGE character. Kayo, on the other hand, is a POORLY WRITTEN female protagonist + can be summed up in just five simple steps...\\n\\n\r\n(1)Gets abused by her mother\\n\r\n(2)Doesn't like smiling\\n\r\n(3)Gets abused by her mother\\n\r\n(4)Likes mittens\\n\r\n(5)Enjoys the word \"baka\"\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, despite Kayo being an overall poor female protagonist, I feel that Satoru's character was, while deeply flawed, decent enough to uphold both himself and Kayo + is therefore, an AVERAGE rating for the main cast.\\n\\n\r\n(2)Supporting Cast\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting characters in this show are SH*T. There's no sugar coating it, no hiding it with an invisible cloak, no disguising it in a wardrobe and there's no blaming it on ISIS. When my own sh*t sees this sh*t, it sh*ts out sh*t faster than Mexicans sh*t out aborted children.\\n\\n\r\n(1)Kenya~The super-intelligent-thoughtful-calm-composed-super detective who is a child...wait..there's something missing here...\\n\\n\r\n(2)Airi~The side hoe who Satoru can end up with if things don't work work out with bae....she's like...a really nice person...\\n\\n\r\n(3)Sachiko~Every orphan's wet dream...\\n\\n\r\n(4)Akemi~The multi-dimensional side villain who abuses Kayo because she was abused by her own mother...\\n\\n\r\n(5)Akemi's Mom~The infinitely-dimensional extra side villain who orchestrated 9/11, Michael Jackson's death + abusing her own daughter..which lead to her daughter abusing her daughter..which created the circle of life itself...\\n\\n\r\n(6)Yashiro~The teacher who is always nice to his students and likes to eat sweets...an inspiration to us all really...\\n\\n\r\n(7)Kazu~Who?\\n\\n\r\n(8)Hiromi~The one guy I actually respect in this show...he saw his opportunity + he snatched it...true friend right here, you guys.\\n\\n\r\nNow, it may look like I'm 'intentionally making fun' of the supporting characters in the show, but I'm simply showcasing how vague + poorly realized these characters are, with little to no effort taken when writing them. I thought about actually TRYING my best to make them seem as appealing as possible, but I realized that these characters are so one dimensional + poorly written that they really don't deserve it. In conclusion, the supporting characters in Erased are...AWFUL.\\n\\n\r\n(3)Voice Acting\\n\\n\r\nOne of the biggest surprises in the show is how great the overall VA's are in the show. While I may have various issues with the characters themselves, I don't think I can deny how well portrayed most of the characters was. Particularly, from Shinnosuke Mitsushima + Tao Tsuchiya, the two VA's of Satoru. ESPECIALLY when we realize that this is there first VA performance in anime. One of the few things I found to be unique in this show, was how Satoru was given two separate VA's depending on whether he is a child or a man. It was a nice touch by the writers + it makes Satoru, if only slightly, a more interesting MC. Other performances by more well known VA's Aoi Yuuki + Minami Takayama were reasonably well done, I do wish they were given more chances to showcase their talent, instead of just repeating \"baka\" over and over again. Other than that, Aoi Yuuki nailed the personality of a kuudere + Minami Takayama nailed the role of a single parent raising her son in the best way that she can. In conclusion, the VA's in Erased was surprisingly......VERY GOOD.\\n\\n\r\n(C)ANIMATION & SOUND\\n\\n\r\n(1)Animation\\n\\n\r\nAnother, unsurprising this time, aspect of the show that is enjoyable is the show's animation. For the MOST PART, it is a clean cut, well directed, visually appealing use of art in an anime. It uses a color palette when Satoru is in the past, which really helps provide the overall feel to the anime: a dark mystery with shades of light seeping through the cracks. The film stripe used when Satoru is thinking something out is, while a minor detail, shows that the anime does care about it's presentation + overall appeal to the viewer. That being said, I don't feel that the 'cinematography' is anything special to be honest with you. It's MORE functional than groundbreaking, pretty than beautiful + normal than interesting. In conclusion, despite the animation not being particularly astounding, it is clear to see that what is present here is........GOOD.\\n\\n\r\n(2)Sound\\n\\n\r\nFinally, we have the soundtrack. First off, we welcome the triumphant return to Asian Kung Fu Generation, who deliver a stellar performance in the OP. The ending song is also well done, and deserves an honorable mention. Although...unfortunately..the same cannot be said for the OST by Yuki Kajiura. Like the anime itself, while the OST is not particularly bad, it doesn't add much to the anime, if any at all. Although, Kajiura is a great composer overall, the OST produced here is...well..more on the repetitive + dull side than anything. In conclusion, the two stellar OP's + ED's are unfortunately wasted on an OST that is rather......AVERAGE.\\n\\n\r\n(D)FINAL VERDICT\\n\\n\r\n\"This anime will NEVER be Erased from my memory\"\\n\\n\r\nI would say I'd only have to drink 1 mixing of Jose Cuervo + Milk along with just 1 episode of Boku no Pico, for this anime to be completely, and utterly ERASED from my memory...\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, is Erased a terrible anime? No. Compared to the amount of filth being produced in anime, Erased looks like a polished saint. Is Erased overrated? Obviously. The ammount of plot holes, cheap cliffhangers, weak cast of characters and it's unsatisfying conclusion speak for itself. Would I recommend Erased to someone? Yes + No. It's not the GREATEST anime ever produced, it's not even in the top 100 anime produced, but it's not the WORST anime ever produced, it's no were near the top 100 worst anime ever produced. It has a STRONG BEGINNING but it eventually loses it's steam.....Don't expect a masterpiece or something very good, expect something that is just plain old....AVERAGE.\\n\\n\r\nSUPERHERO RANK: The Blob from X-Men, incredibly awesome when he started out....but ended up as one of the SLOWEST,  MOST ANTI-CLIMATIC + BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENTS in the superhero world.....\\n\\n\r\n*Feel free to give me some good ol' feedback, whether you want to worship the ground I stepped upon or..just like..castrate me or something...I really don't mind*\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "This anime really hit me hard. The emotional burden that slowly weighed down on the protagonist as he tried his best to support a friend is very similar to my own. There\u2019s this kid who went to the same school as I did in the 7th grade. He was really quiet and always alone so everyone just wrote him off as a weirdo that wouldn\u2019t fight back. He was bullied constantly. It was like a sport to the kids in my class. Let\u2019s see who can get him to react first! I personally never partook in the teasing but I felt terrible for not doingor saying anything when I found out about his abusive family. Both of his parents were drug-addicted and often not aware that their son even went to school in the morning. Sometimes he showed up with bandages or black eyes and when the gym teacher asked what happened he would just say that he fell on his bike. We knew he was too poor to own a bike. Eventually the teaching staff cracked down hard on the bullies and threatened detention for anyone who openly teased the kid. That didn\u2019t stop them. In fact, it only made it more fun. Let\u2019s see who can pull off the craziest stunt without getting caught by the teacher! It was hell for the kid. One day as I was leaving the school hall, I saw him hunched over on the steps playing on a tablet. Apparently in the recent gift exchange, one of the teachers had bought him an iPad. I looked over his shoulder as I passed and noticed he was playing Clash of Clans. At the time I had an account that was Town Hall level 11, which meant I was pretty good. I knew I could help him out if I invited him to my high-level clan. I memorized his username, sent him a request that night, and saved some troops for when he would join. I planned to greet him anonymously in chat and donate some level 10 minions for his base defense, but he never accepted my invitation. I found out in the morning that the kid and his parents mysteriously left the town for good. There was a solemn silence at school that day, as if all of my classmates understood how wrong they were to treat him that badly. I couldn\u2019t believe that he was gone and still regret to this day that I didn\u2019t do anything more to help. My sole consolation is that, just a few hours before the clan invitation expired, the kid joined me and I got to finally donate my troops. It was the most bittersweet feeling I have ever felt. I eventually had to kick him out because he was too low level and couldn\u2019t afford to buy gems to upgrade his stuff faster, but whatever. I did my part.\\n\\n\r\nI rate this anime 6/10 because I don\u2019t want people to think I\u2019m a pedophile for liking a show about little kid romance.",

            "content": "BokuMachi is the story of Satoru Fujimura, a grown man in the body of a young boy, his past self, fighting to crack a gruesome series of abduction-murder cases and save the lives of innocent people across two separate time zones, all while evading law enforcement and the actual serial killer. It is a short, action-packed, heart-wrenching story about hope and faith, love and regret, sorrow and joy, but most of all, it is a story of believing and trusting in yourself and in your closest of friends no matter where you are and what time you are in. BokuMachi is certainly one of veryfew 12-episode animes that are able to pull off such a complex and deep plot and so well executed within such a short span of time, and is definitely an anime that nobody should miss.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cOn that island, I think about the town I left behind.

The anime first introduces us to a mediocre main lead, Satoru, who has a useful, yet slightly spooky, ability which he calls \u201cRevive\u201d, the ability to go back in time to prevent a tragedy from happening. For most of his life, Satoru has only ever had the chance to go back 5 to 10 minutes at a time, but when his mother, on the verge of solving an 18-year-old unclosed abduction-murder case, is killed by an unknown assailant, Satoru is sent back 18 years in time to solve the mystery connecting the two crimes. The story jumps straight into the heart of the drama and excitement, and is mercilessly gripping from the get-go, setting a perfect stage for one really good ride, and I\u2019m glad to say it delivered. (+1 for excitement) \\n\\n\r\nOnce Satoru makes the big jump back in time, the story switches gear to the year 1988 as we begin to \u201crecollect\u201d pieces of information about the case and the characters surrounding the case through Satoru\u2019s 10-year-old eyes but his 29-year-old perspective and memory. It kicks off with the first major arc, the Kayo arc set in 1988, which has a brief respite midway with the Airi arc set in 2006, until it resumes and concludes at episode 9. Afterward, the final arc of revealing the true identity of the killer begins. For the rest of the plot section, I will continue to refer to the main antagonist of the anime as \u201cthe killer\u201d to prevent spoilers on his identity. If you really do not want to be spoiled however, please skip over the characters section entirely.\\n\\n\r\nThe entire story is beautifully written and well-connected from beginning to the end. We see parallels all over the place across the time zones and the anime even spends time reminding us of these just in case we miss them. When I was approaching the end of the anime, I was honestly worried about how it would tie up all of the loose ends and resolve the entire mystery. There were just so many parts of contention that the dots seemed impossible to connect together, and in my mind, I didn\u2019t know what to expect. But the anime completely blew my mind with the killer\u2019s reveal at the end, and I have to say that I definitely could not predict who it was. I had no idea. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime managed to drop a couple of red herrings in the form of mysterious unnamed characters and the entire plotline of the killer having to have been someone with access to information on the pizza shifts, and I was completely fooled and baffled. What I do know now however, is that once he was revealed, I began to see that basically everything I had anticipated might pose as a problem finally fell into place. The killer\u2019s motives were well-resolved and I rediscovered many subtle hints along the way that pointed to the culprit. I really enjoyed this plot twist, so I\u2019m not going to say much else but except this - look forward to it! (+1 for plot twist)\\n\\n\r\nThe final resolution of the anime was also absolutely on point. Even after Satoru had gone through so much, he realizes that after changing the past, then technically the killer hasn\u2019t committed any crimes since he was stopped. He also concludes correctly that if the killer hasn\u2019t killed him all 15 years while he was in a coma, then the killer meant to keep him alive and would never kill him. Satoru and his friends\u2019 final outsmarting of the killer, exposing him and making him commit an attempted murder was the final blow to the killer, finishing him off for good and tying up the final loose end.\\n\\n\r\nThe irony is that for all the talk of hamsters and spiders, where the killer thought he was in control, it was actually the killer who was being controlled by that one surviving hamster, Satoru, and it was the killer himself whose life was hanging by that thin spider thread, since he had nobody to catch him if that thread should break. (+1 for fitting, coherent resolution)\\n\\n\r\nThe main reason why I thought the plot was very rich and complex was because of the amount of thought they put into the thematic development, which I really appreciated throughout the anime. I list the key themes of the anime below, with their associated symbolisms in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nRegret and Revival\\n\r\nSachiko keeps reminding Satoru that \u201cThinking it\u2019s your fault after the fact is just pointless,\u201d which hints that regret is useless the past can be rewritten. Satoru is then given not just one but two chances to fix his own fate after regretting the decisions he once made. I love the fact that Satoru names his secret power \u201cRevival\u201d, because it totally ties in with the idea that he is essentially reliving his life each time he goes back in time, and it also fits perfectly into the narrative where he eventually \u201crevives\u201d from his comatose state 15 years later. While none of us is going back in time in reality, the anime really hits home the point that making amends for our mistakes is far more essential than simply regretting them, because it is only then we can learn and change for the better. (+1)\\n\\n\r\nIntertwined Fate\\n\r\nSatoru sharing the same birthday as Kayo is not merely just a coincidence but is part of the theme that their fates are inseparably intertwined, since Kayo\u2019s death also means Satoru\u2019s \u201cdeath\u201d (or arrest) and as we learn from the end of the anime, Kayo\u2019s survival means Satoru\u2019s survival. Kayo also persistently hints to Satoru throughout the anime that \u201cthey are both fakes and liars,\u201d suggesting that the two have a lot more in common than at first glance. In fact, both are kids raised by single parents, even though both their parents differ greatly from each other. The anime once again reminds us that we live in a connected world where the good things we do for others can bring the entire community joy, while the good things we choose not to do, we may regret for the rest of our lives. (+1)\\n\\n\r\nHope and Time\\n\r\nIn every classroom scene, the back of the classroom features 18 columns of 2 rows of the word \u201cHope\u201d. Not only does this represent the 18 years that Satoru hopes that he can change, but the 2 rows also signifies the two simultaneous lives that Satoru is trying to fix, his life as a third grader and also his life as a 29-year-old. In reality, both of these lives are interconnected and are really the same life, as is shown throughout the anime by how changing his actions in his past affect his future. Even though Satoru doesn\u2019t know how it will change, he hopes that his courage will change it for the better. (+1)\\n\\n\r\nParallel Relationship\\n\r\nThe relationship between Satoru and Kayo parallels that between Satoru and Airi in many interesting ways. Just as Satoru defended Kayo back as a third-grader saying that there was no way Kayo would steal the lunch money, Airi also told Satoru that there was no way Satoru would kill his own mother, and both scenes add to the overall theme of trust. Also, both Kayo and Airi tell Satoru the same line, \u201cAre you stupid?\u201d at various points in time in the anime, which is a nod to Satoru\u2019s nonsense at times. Also, the snow-filled playground was the place that Satoru and Kayo first meet, just as how Satoru and Airi \u201cfirst\u201d meet under the snow-covered bridge in the new timeline shown in the epilogue. In addition, both Kayo and Airi have had their parents go through a heart-breaking divorce, which makes finding love all the more meaningful - because it is a rekindling of what was lost, a filling of something missing in one\u2019s soul. (+1)\\n\\n\r\nWinter and Snow\\n\r\nIn both cases, Satoru-Kayo / Satoru-Airi first meet in a place filled with snow (\u201cyuki\u201d) which is a wordplay on the word courage (\u201cyuuki\u201d), which is consistently brought up throughout the anime starting from when Satoru first introduces his weird but good older friend Jun Shiratori. Just as how a guy needs a ton of courage to ask a girl out, so here heavy snow plays an important role in signifying the beginning of both relationships. Most of the anime was played out in the winter, of course, because Satoru needed some immense courage to change not merely his own fate, but the fates of those around him. (+1)\\n\\n\r\nThe Town Without Me \\n\r\nThe title off the anime not only applies to Kayo, who wishes that she could escape the town because she was abused and all alone, but it also has a deeper meaning when applied to Satoru and Yashiro. When Satoru is in his coma for the 15 year period, the rest of his friends are literally living in a town without him, with all of them carrying on their own lives and leaving him behind, but always appreciating what Satoru has done for them. Also, towards the end of the anime, Yashiro finally realizes that Satoru was right about the fact that Satoru was Yashiro\u2019s only reason to live, another way of saying that Yashiro cannot live in the Town without Satoru. (+1)\\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, I want to point out that in episode 4, since the time is set in the year 1988, which is a leap year, there is a day in class before the day the abduction happens on March 1, where the class blackboard clearly writes February 29. Well done! (+1 for details)\\n\\n\r\nI absolutely loved the plot of this anime, and I thought it was stellar compared to many of the mediocre 12-episode animes I have watched. Having said that though, I have found a total of 3 plot holes in the story, 1 of which is major, however. Feel free to skip to the next section if you don\u2019t fancy nitpicking.\\n\\n\r\nIn episode 6, Airi\u2019s relatives seem awfully too much at peace with the fact that their house has just been the target of arson and they don\u2019t seem to fully realize that they are in a very frustrated situation where they have just lost all of their belongings in the house and they have to find alternative accommodation while police investigations continue. Even if they have property insurance, it is still shocking to have your own house burned to the ground and it is still a pain to have to deal with the insurance agencies and police regarding claims.\\n\\n\r\nIn episode 8, the killer enters the bus where Kayo is hiding in and kicks the wall of the bus, probably in frustration that his plan couldn\u2019t get carried out. But if this is a regular haunt for him, then shouldn\u2019t he have easily smelt the cup ramen that was cooked in the bus and notice that something was certainly amiss? In any case, it\u2019s hard to mimic the smell of a storehouse and I don\u2019t think that third graders would have the expertise to masks smells either.\\n\\n\r\nIn episode 10, after the killer\u2019s shocking reveal, there\u2019s also the side reveal that the seatbelt was actually rigged so that Satoru would get stuck inside, with no means of escape. Unfortunately, the idea that a seatbelt would be sufficient restraint to hold back an 11-year-old is utterly ridiculous. Please, give me a break, for a kid that small in size, it\u2019s beyond easy to get out of that seatbelt if he really tries to. Not a very a good plan, and nice try, anime, but I\u2019m not convinced at all.\\n\\n\r\nStill, the plot for this anime is great, and probably the strongest aspect of this anime. It is worth watching the anime simply for the story alone, if nothing else. But let me get to all the other great stuff about this anime in the next sections below.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 2/3 - The animation was generally very good, and I especially liked the effect where we see Satoru\u2019s Revival power coming into play. There are times when it was jumpy though.\\n\r\nAesthetics: 2/3 - I wasn\u2019t a big fan of the art, even though it was decent. There was a no effort to make Satoru\u2019s mother look like she aged over 18 years.\\n\r\nOP Sequence: 1/2 - The OP Sequence could have had some improvement, especially for the empty scenes that really made it dull at times\\n\r\nED Sequence: 1/2 -The ED sequence was a little better in the art department, but was a little too abstract for me and I couldn\u2019t figure out how many parts tied in with the anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nOP Theme: 1/2 - OP theme was okay, I didn\u2019t really like it.\\n\r\nED Theme: 0/2 - ED theme was kind of a mess.\\n\r\nBackground Music: 4/4 - The background music here was really good and fitting! I always felt like my own mood instantly changes with the music all the time.\\n\\n\r\nNo bonus points because there are no additional themes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nSatoru Fujinuma\\n\r\nSatoru, the single son of a single mother, is the very standard protagonist whose primary goal is to become a \u201cHero of Justice\u201d, something your typical shounen lead would do. He\u2019s your classic upright, righteous, brave and well-meaning main male lead who essentially leads the entire cast through the plot, most of it thanks to his memories of the future. He is also courageous and daring enough to do things like instigate a police investigation in the Shiratori household, abduct Kayo from her own mother and even go face-to-face with the killer in the final climax without even batting an eyelid (+1 for development). He also has his soft side when it comes to the girls around him, and is always constantly being embarrassed and saying to himself \u201cGet a grip, you\u2019re 29 years old!\u201d whenever he does something that comes across as slightly romantic with Kayo (+1 for interactions). Throughout the anime he moves from simply trying to save his mother, to genuinely trying to save Kayo, to saving others, and finally to taking down the killer once and for good. Unfortunately, he does not have any defining or memorable characteristic and is a rather unoriginal overused character archetype.\\n\\n\r\nKayo Hinazuki\\n\r\nKayo, the daughter caught up in the aftermath of a messy divorce which consists of regular physical abuse, starts off very cold and distant towards everybody because of her lack of faith in the human condition. As a victim of household abuse, she regularly hides her bruises every Monday when she comes to school and is an instant social outcast. However, once she warms up to Satoru and friends, she is really cute whenever she interacts with them, especially when they go out on dates, which are essentially ways that Satoru keeps her from harm. Kayo goes from being cowardly and trapped by her plight to opening up to the gang and even daring to go against her own mother (+1 for character growth), and much of it was thanks to Satoru being very patient with her and gaining her trust throughout the anime. We also later learn the reasons behind her mother\u2019s frustration when her grandmother shows up to take care of her (+1 for backstory).\\n\\n\r\nAiri Katagiri\\n\r\nAiri, a colleague of Satoru who works with him at a pizza place in 2006, is more than a decade younger than Satoru, but Sachiko hints at the possibility of a budding relationship between the two of the anyway. Satoru finds her a little annoying at first but when Airi saves Satoru from being captured by the police, Satoru begins to open up his feelings toward her and they gradually begin to warm up to each other. Airi can be said to be Satoru\u2019s main love interest, and the best part of her is that she dared to give her own boss a hard punch in the face as a means of standing up for Satoru (+1 for bravery). She is fiercely loyal and just as brave as Satoru in her own right.\\n\\n\r\nSachiko Fujinuma\\n\r\nMy favourite character in the anime, Sachiko, Satoru\u2019s mother, has some really insane intuition, which Satoru calls \u201cYokai\u201d throughout the anime. She always predicts what Satoru is about to do before he does it and she always supports him in everything that he does. Better yet, Sachiko, as a news reporter, cracked the case that Satoru has been trying to solve for the entire anime, back in episode 1, which is testament to her wits. She is also known not to bat an eyelid even when getting sliced across the forehead with a garden shovel and having it bleed onto her nose. Need I mention that Sachiko was also the one who tirelessly cared for Satoru for an entire 15 years while he was in a vegetative state? That\u2019s what love and dedication is all about, man (+1 for lovable)! It would have been good however, if we were given some hint as to what happened that made her become a single mother, as it would have added a lot to her development as a character.\\n\\n\r\nKobayashi Kenya\\n\r\nKenya, Satoru\u2019s closest friend from back in third grade, is probably way too smart for his age but he consistently proves his worth throughout the anime, making him a god-sent aide whom Satoru can work with and fully place his trust in. Kenya is instrumental in helping Satoru protect the killer\u2019s targets, namely Kayo, Hiromi and Aya, especially when Satoru was not around. Kenya\u2019s disposition is generally calm and he maintains this quiet but discerning aura in his conversations with Satoru. Although Kenya doesn\u2019t understand what Satoru does most of the time, he chooses to believe in him and this unwavering loyalty is highly commendable. However, it is a pity that we don\u2019t know much of Kenya\u2019s backstory here.\\n\\n\r\nYashiro Gaku\\n\r\nYashiro, Satoru\u2019s homeroom teacher back in third grade, actually helps Satoru a lot during his initial investigations. Yashiro is initially painted as a very kind, generous and friendly teacher who never turns away kids who need his help. He even fetches Satoru and his mother home when he sees them grocery shopping at some point. Yashiro\u2019s involvement with Kayo\u2019s case also made him the least suspicious character in the anime, since he was genuinely concerned for Kayo\u2019s well-being and helped her get protection from her abusive mother (+1 for multi-facted nature). As we learn later in the anime, once he is revealed to be the killer, we get a clearer picture of his psychopathic motives and how he planned to frame people and cover his own actions up. His backstory of being unlucky with love sheds some light on his emotional instability and propensity to psychopathic behaviour, while his unusually large stash of candies suggests that he uses them to lure unsuspecting kids. We also know that first, he targets only girls, meaning that he was probably a pedophile (not unlikely for an elementary school teacher) who raped young girls and then killed and disposed of their bodies. We also know however, that he was smart enough to target Hiromi, who looks like a girl, so that he would not get implicated in the affair (+1 for convincing motives). It was also very clear that once Satoru exposed him, he felt completely undermined and became obsessed with Satoru instead of carrying on his pedophilic crimes.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the supporting cast were also very interesting. Hiromi, the guy who looks like a girl, is like the second cutest character in the anime, second only to Kayo. The rest of the gang, Kayu, Osamu, Aya did not make too much of an impact on the anime. Perhaps the only character that I thought could have gotten a bigger role in the anime was Sawada because he is Shinako\u2019s colleague in news reporting and would also have investigative skills and interest in the entire case.\\n\\n\r\nAs a whole though, I thought the characters were generally very typical of an anime and none of them really stood out from the others, so no bonus points there.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nRomance\\n\r\nOne of my favourite scenes is when Satoru and Kayo experience having red foxes in the snowy hills run around them and Kayo says, \u201cI wonder if they\u2019re a couple.\u201d To which Satoru replies, \u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d And then they are both taken aback and realize how embarrassing the whole situation is. The follow-up Christmas tree scene was also very beautiful and it looked like the anime really turned up the artistic prowess of that scene in particular. (+1 romance)\\n\\n\r\nDrama\\n\r\nOne of the most beautiful scenes in the anime occurs when Kayo looks at the breakfast that Sachiko prepares for her in the morning, she not only bursts into tears but brings the rest of us viewers with her. Nothing breaks the heart more than seeing a little girl, once abused and broken, finally cry out of pure joy. Of course, there were other very dramatic parts in the anime like the killer\u2019s reveal and every single time we see shots of Kayo getting abused. Those scenes make me shudder every single time. (+2 emotion)\\n\\n\r\nComedy\\n\r\nMost of the comic relief comes from Satoru\u2019s conversations with himself or his mother, and they are really quite handy sometimes. I recall the particularly funny scene where Satoru and Kayo are sleeping the same room with Sachiko in the middle, and then Sachiko asks, \u201cAm I in the way?\u201d To which Satoru replies, \u201cYeah,\u201d and gets knocked on the head for it. While the comedy isn\u2019t much, the anime does deliver enough in brilliant fashion. (+1 for comedy)\\n\\n\r\nMystery\\n\r\nI really love how the anime managed to keep up the suspense throughout the entire anime, and I was particularly pleased about how I was always engaged by the little snippets they included at the end of every episode that introduced something new and left viewers dying to find out exactly what happens next. Really well done here! (+1 for suspense)\\n\\n\r\nPacing: 3/3\\n\r\nI absolutely loved the pacing for this anime and I felt that it was neither too fast nor too slow. The suspense was certainly not overboard but just enough to keep to excitement up, while the anime dedicated a good amount of time to developing the plot and the backstories of many characters so that it also didn\u2019t feel like the story was progressing too fast. I have to admit that I watched this entire anime in one sitting just because it was so good and I was hooked.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime gets a bonus point for not having any filler episodes. (+1)\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAltogether, I absolutely enjoyed this anime to the core! To me, it really seems like a very condensed version of Steins;Gate, only with a much simpler plot line and clearer progression through the unravelling of the mysteries surrounding it. With a solid plot line, a cast of interesting characters and some excellent themes coming out of the anime, I would recommend this anime to almost anybody.\\n\\n\r\nFeel free to PM me or leave a profile comment to tell me why you agree/disagree with what I\u2019ve written here, and as always, thank you for your patience in reading!",

I laughed. I cried. I was amazed. The only thing that sorta bugged me was the art. Huge lipson the ladies? Didn't feel it at first but I warmed up to it.

            "content": "It's really sad that a lot of people say that this anime is \"not that good\" because the author is not doing what a mystery anime needs to be good. So, I'll try to clarify some things with what I understand in this anime, hoping that it'll change the mind of some people.\r\nDon't read the part about the story until you haven't seen completely the anime!\r\nStory:\r\nFirst of all, we might wonder about the meaning of the word \"mystery\". We are talking about mystery in an anime when there is something that is not clear or kept secret or remains unexplained during a part of astory. It's not the same that a detective story! If it was the case, then the investigation would be the principal plot and for those who think that this anime is this kind of story, I have just one question: ARE YOU SERIOUS ?! The author told us almost in the beginning of the story who is guilty. Watch again the last seconds of the third episode if you don't believe me. Then, if it was a detective story, it would be not interesting if it's to discover what we already know.\\n\\n\r\nSo, the plot of this anime is ABSOLUTELY NOT the investigation and it doesn't pretend to be one of this kind. But there is truly mystery and the author is managing this very well. Even if we know the identity of the murderer, we are not absolutely sure of it, there is a doubt as it's not said clearly if it's him or not until the main character, Fujinuma Satoru, realises it himself. In addition to that, there are some scenes where the alleged offender is doing what should be not in his interest and that accentuate this feeling. Also, we often cannot predict how the events are going to happen, even if we can guess what will happen. So, we imagine many scenarios for the following events at the end of an episode and that's the sign of a good script for such story. But this is just a part of this story. This anime is also a lesson.\\n\\n\r\nThe author is showing us exactly how most of children and adults react in the case where there is a beaten and isolated child: they do nothing. Like the others, during his first childhood, Satoru didn't react. But he grew up and he knew what he should have done before. At this moment, he became a good model for those who're watching. It reminds that we have to be vigilant for such things and that we must take this seriously, to children as to adults. Maybe it seems obvious reading these lines, but it's often forgotten in everyday life, as well as the fact we have to be wary of the persons around us, even if we have the feeling to know them. \\n\\n\r\nBut more generally, it reminds that we should act so to not have any regrets, to not become as Satoru before his first travel to his childhood. After all, we live just once normally, it's better to regret to have done something than to regret the opposite in most of the cases. And don't be mistaken between parents who are well-wishing with those who are not like that. If you have the chance to have good parents, don't fight with them for anything, it would be a waste.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, I think that it's a good story, whatever the age of the viewers. It's not a complicated one but it permits to keep us in suspense throughout the episodes.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound:\\n\r\nFor the animation, the studio has done a good work. The drawings are good, as the shooting with plans that I love very much. They know how to show a stressful moment and a magnificent one too. And I thank Yuki Kajiura, among others, for her excellent job with the soundtrack, as usual, which accompanying very well the important moments.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe main character Fujinuma Satoru is supposed to be a young man like another, with no special abilities (except that he can make time travels) and for that, he matches the role while being quite appealing. Besides him, I really like Hinazuki Kayo with her personality, even if I think that it doesn't match really well with a child. But, personally, I think that my favourite character is the teacher Yashiro Gaku (I usually love mad characters). The others have their specific aspects too and are appreciable.\\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\nI think that if one day I have a child, I'll absolutely show him this anime. Nothing is perfect but I think this anime is close enough to it to be a masterpiece.",

            "content": "\u201dI\u2019m sure that what\u2019s in front of you is all still in progress. The conclusion is still up ahead and nobody knows what it is yet.\u201d\r\n - Katagiri Airi\r\n\u201cBoku dake ga Inai Machi\u201d or \u201cErased\u201d is another addition to the growing number of time-travel anime. This anime caused a huge uproar to MAL users when it started, it only took the first episode to drop it at rank 25 at the all-time anime rankings and it continued climbing the ladder every week. Its popularity is not limited on MAL; it is also famous on various anime sites. I\u2019ve read an article in goboiano.com with acaption stating that the first episode of \u201cErased\u201d is what every anime should strive for, and I truly agree in that. Episode 1 is like the prelude to climax already, it feels like you\u2019ve already watch half of an anime series. With all that said, \u201cErased\u201d is not just about its pilot episode, the whole story itself is magnificent! Now let\u2019s get things started.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 9/10\\n\r\nPart of being human is having regrets. And through having regrets, you\u2019ll wound up thinking wishful things like \u201cif I had done this\u201d \u201dif I had done that.\u201d Still, we cannot turn back the time. Life is not as considerate as a digital game; it has no save points and your only choice is to move forward. However, \u201cFujinuma Satoru\u201d is different. He got an out of this world ability that most humans would want to have; he can undo his previous actions for a better outcome. He sometimes goes back between one to five minutes in time whenever something bad is about to happen. In that short amount of time, he searches for something that is amiss to prevent the worst-case scenario. As grand and heroic as it sounds but this entire feat is not through his will, it just happens automatically and he sometimes gets the receiving end of the incident he prevented. He named this phenomenon as \u201cRevival.\u201d Now let\u2019s go for the plot. \u201cFujinuma Satoru\u201d is a 29 years old striving manga author and he\u2019s been living his life in peace when a life-changing event happened; his mother got murdered and he is the prime suspect. Amidst the confusion, his \u201cRevival\u201d triggered. Then, he finds himself more than five minutes back in time, he returned to 18 years from his past. It is the time where he has to face his greatest regret, the time before the disappearance of his fifth grade classmate; \u201cHinazuki Kayo.\u201d Now back in his 11 years old body, \u201cSatoru\u201d deduced that preventing \u201cKayo\u2019s\u201d demise might be the key in changing the future. Thus begins the tale of a prince\u2019s struggle in saving his princess, the great story of resisting fate.\\n\\n\r\nART: 7/10\\n\r\nThe character design and facial expressions are ok. The background is well-done if you take a better look at it, one example of it is \u201dSatoru\u2019s\u201d footprint on the snow at the beginning of episode 10.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 6/10\\n\r\nThe background music is good and appropriate for the scenes. The ending song is ok. What has to notice is the opening song, it is freaking awesome! The song\u2019s title is \u201cRe:Re:\u201d and it is sang by \u201cAsian Kung-Fu Generation.\u201d It\u2019s a pretty lame band name and it is my first time hearing about them but damn! That song is just too great that it even gave me an earworm.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 8/10\\n\r\nThe characters were great. Truth be told, there were a lot of fans who got disappointed in \u201cErased\u2019s\u201d character developments. Just like what I have mentioned above, it started at rank 25 and continued rising till rank 5. But, when episode 11 got out, I saw its rank went down for the first time. Right now it\u2019s on rank 10. Well, as for me, the character developments were fine. It\u2019s appropriate and realistic for how the plot proceeded.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 10/10\\n\r\nI got my Steins;Gate syndrome back! My feeling in watching \u201cErased\u201d is similar to how I felt when I first encountered \u201cSteins;Gate.\u201d These two anime were awesome and they both tackles time travelling. In addition, both don\u2019t show any preview for the next episode that it got me feeling like \u201cWhat the f**k!\u201d \u201cAre you f**king serious!\u201d every time an episode ends and I feel like wanting more. Well, you won\u2019t feel this way now that it\u2019s done, you can watch it non-stop. What is adding more to the excitement in \u201cErased\u201d is the thrill in figuring out who the culprit is; this serves as the main engine for boosting the enjoyment in watching it.\\n\\n\r\nMy overall score for \u201cErased\u201d is 9. One last push and I might have given it a perfect score, too bad that push never came. Still, I can\u2019t deny that it truly is a masterpiece and it surely did leave a mark in the history of anime. I bet the talks about \u201cErased\u201d won\u2019t die anytime soon and its legacy will continue to amaze people. If you haven\u2019t seen it yet then you better start now to understand the difference between great and crap animes. Well, that wraps it! See you on my other reviews!\\n",

The story was awesome as well, and did kind of bring back memories of Steins;Gate, with the time travelling aspect. Going back in time to prevent your loved ones and friends from dying in the present? i think that was well done. Really recommend it this anime if you enjoyed Steins;Gate or if you need a good mystery/thriller anime to fill up your time! I really thought the art style was very similar to everyother anime, but still the way the characters were designed and animated made them feel more human and easier to understand. The music was also very well implemented. Overall, this anime really was fun to take my mind off of things, and captured my attention.",

            "content": "Personally, this anime has stricken me so much that it has landed in my Top 10 animes. It was definitely my favourite anime from 2015 due to its unique story line and charcters.\r\nART: In my opinion the art in this anime was quite simple yet pretty in its own way. The anime is set mainly in the winter time. I rated it a 9/10, however this may vary from everyones preferences.\r\nSOUND: The opening is amazing, i even downloaded it on my phone (/^\u25bd^)/ The ost is quite nice and fits the anime, as well as the insert songs which fit the chosen scenes. 9/10\r\nCHARACTERS: Ifound the major characters appealing and well developed, but I was a little disappointed with the lack of development on the other characters such as the Sensei and Satoru's mother, although this mainly is because the anime was a little short on time and didnt get to develop these charcters that well. I hoped for more information on their pasts~ However there is more information in the actual manga. Rated 9/10\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: Even though the art, sound and characters got a 9/10 from me, I rate the entire anime a 10/10 because I enjoyed the anime so much. Something that I found enjoyable was figuring out who the murder might be early in the anime and then finding out why. I also enjoyed reading a little bit into \"The Spiders Thread\" which is mentioned in the anime. Paying attention to small things like how the opening changes by the end of the anime and trying to find metaphors and deeper meanings in the anime was very satisfying (\u0e51\u02c3\u0335\u1d17\u02c2\u0335)\u0648\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime is one of my favourites and I really recommend you checking it out because it is definitely not a waste of your precious weeaboo time \u2727\u0669(\u2022\u0301\u2304\u2022\u0301\u0e51) If you enjoy mystery and solving puzzles, you have no legal excuse for not checking this out, I promise you, you will get hooked up on it on the very first episode! <3\\n\\n",

            "content": "Wow. Where am I supposed to begin with such an anime? \r\nI guess I should start with the characters. \r\nUsually in most animes I have seen I love almost every character but there are a few in the bunch that annoy me a little bit. In this anime, I disliked NO ONE. The characters in this anime were so well detailed and thought out. You really form a connection with every single character in the show because you see their dedication to Satoru and how far lengths they will go to help him out. \r\nThe story:\r\nThe story was unbelievably capturing. Very few anime have Iactually waited for the timer to tick lower and lower for the new episode to come out. I was planning my Thursday mornings around me having the best \"Boku dake ga Inai Machi\" experience possible. The story captures you so well, it really keeps you on your toes throughout the entire experience. I got so attached to it, I found myself rooting for Satoru a bunch hoping he would finally succeed in his cause. To my surprise, all of the different time cuts were done absolutely perfectly. I was a bit nervous after episode 1 when the first time shift was introduced, but they did it better than I could have ever imagined.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall:\\n\r\nThis anime overall for me was a total 10/10. I thought everything was done so well and I was connected with the story from basically the beginning! Anyone who loves a good mystery or even just a heartwarming anime should definitely watch this anime! This anime makes you feel happy, sad, and even scared or confused sometimes! In the end, this anime is definitely a must watch, some people might not want to watch it because of the hype, but I do believe it is 100% worth it!\\n\\n\r\nAlso sorry for my grammar, I now it isn't perfect! And sorry if this was a bad review, it is my first! Also, I tried to keep it short and sweet so some things are left out.",

It's been so long since I watched through a show, immediately slammed my hands onto the keyboard to get to MAL and give an anime a 10. Through all the midst of anime I rated 6's and 5's, this is so refreshing.\r\nI adored this show. If this show were a banana split, I would eat it up until the very last bit, slam my hands on the countertopand demand at least a dozen more.\\n\\n\r\nYeah yeah, I'm ready for the \"but Gingy, this show is so overrated and predictable!\" Come at me. Because no matter how much you think this show is getting too much hype, I'm not budging. I loved this show. I loved every moment where I chewed on my fingernails or felt my heart sink for Kayo.  \\n\\n\r\nOne of the show's biggest strengths is how smart it is. Satoru is a SMART character that's also HUMAN. In anime, it's hard to find characters that aren't stereotypes. Sometimes I'm a sucker for the same old same old, but the content I enjoy most contains the characters that I can either relate to or truly respect. Satoru isn't a Gary Stu, but he's also not a dumbbell. The way he thinks ahead and strategizes is incredible to me, and thus I give him a clink of the glass for being such an awesome character.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is fluid and top notch (the Christmas tree scene? OMG). The story might have a few predictable bumps for those who are veterans in the mystery/suspense genre, but I think the clever writing makes up for them.\\n\\n\r\nI massively enjoyed this anime, and I'm so glad I gave it a watch. I'm currently going through that phase where I question if I am getting too old for anime. In 2011, I watched \"Puella Magi Madoka Magica\" for the first time and it changed my life, and pretty much since then, it has been so hard to find an anime to make me feel the way watching \"Madoka\" did. The closest was when I watched \"Revolutionary Girl Utena\" for the first time a few months back, but I think \"Erased\" came closest. It has a few hiccups, but I can easily excuse them because, for the first time in a long time, it made me happy to be watching anime.\\n\\n",

Or he never had Revival during those 15 years in the original timeline?\\n\\n\r\nAnd what the heck is Revival and the thread thing? Why only they have them and does anyone else possess that ability?\\n\\n\r\nWell at least he seems satisfied, but I wish those things were addressed.\\n\\n\r\nAnd my best sentence in this anime was\\n\r\nYashiro I know your future.\\n",

            "content": "Imagine being sent back to the body of your past self. It sounds insane, and horrifying. To be honest, I am a bit mixed on time travel stories. They tend to leave a few obvious plot holes and headaches to pain us with, and even if you're really careful, you're not likely to truly get everything to make perfect sense. Something will go awry. ESPECIALLY when it sets itself up as both a mystery AND a time travel story like this show, ERASED, or in Japan, Boku dake ga Inai Machi, tried... even though it turns out not to be a mystery. On the flipside, time travel stories tend to be really nerve-racking and creative, so if the characters, story, and feel are good enough, most of you aren't likely to care. See \"The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya\". So, this show, when it first came out, was the shit! I'm talking top 30 on MAL right out the bat! In fact, I believe it peaked around #4. Nowadays, while it sits much lower, though still in the top 100, many popular reviewers trash this show, claiming that it was either a complete disappointment in the long run, or never very good to begin with, and I'm here to tell you why it was never as good as you may have once thought, and not as bad as you might think now.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nOne of the major problems of the series is that it tries to set itself up like a mystery when A. it dosen't really follow up on that much, mainly focusing on time travel and relationships, and B. for a mystery, there really wasn't enough feasible suspects, and the true culprit, doesn't carry a very strong motivation for committing the crime of murder in the present day, one such murder that affected main lead Satoru enough to inadvertently jump 18 YEARS into the past. Sure, a majorly dramatic story about child abuse is presented, but the payoff to both that and the \"mystery\" set up at the beginning, felt underwhelming to say the least. The time travel aspect isn't really fleshed out or explained properly, as it's apparently supposed to be this involuntary and symbolic thing, yet if it's so involuntary, why did Satoru have to manually activate it via screaming towards the heavens? What is up with that stupid, stupid time skip? What is with the whole symbolic anecdote about the spider web from heaven? Find out SOME of these questions and more, in the original manga. Then again, that`s the price you pay for settling for a 12 episode slot when what you're adapting requires at least one and a half times that amount, if shows like Blazblue Alter Memory were any indication. Even then, I'm sure some of the show`s faults hamper the manga as well. Even then, the stories, up until the big payoffs, were so engaging and at points, thrilling, obvious and shoved down our throats symbolism aside, that I'm willing to over look some of that, but only to an extent. Also, no matter how you slice it, the ending is no where NEAR the show's caliber, and that fact was rather frustrating at points. I'm talking train wreck levels of just WTF went wrong here.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nFrom what I've gathered, the anime also cut out some of the character development so characters like Airi and Kenya suffer a bit, but overall, both of them are still enjoyable characters along with everyone else, especially Satoru and his gorgeous mom, with only two exceptions, one being so unimportant he may as well have not appeared in the show, and the other being such an unlikable bitch to her own daughter, that you`d expect the justest of deserts for her, yet in a hackneyed attempt to make her, a sadistic and shallow person, likable, that she comes off as a craptacular character. DAMN that was a long sentence! Longest sentence of my life. Yeah, also, Kayo, is sorta interesting, despite coming across as a total ass at the beginning, much like Mumei from Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress. There's one scene that makes Satoru, a jaded 29 year old failed manga writer with a now dead mother that started this whole time travel thing in the first place, rather dubious. He, after discovering that Kayo's mom beats her on a regular basis, convinces his mom, and his friends to allow him to hide her somewhere safe, knowing the danger of both her mom, and a kidnapper that happened around this time. He convinces his friends that this was all just role play, and given that, it is more than a little dubious to change how they live their lives so abruptly, for an extended period of time, even if his awesomesauce momma knows the true purpose behind it all, and how admirable it is, despite the implications. I will not mention anything about the kidnapper/murderer, for it would be spoiling things, so, I'll just keep it at: he starts off as a really good person, and to see him turn into this underdeveloped and poorly written psycho with poorly explained motivations, is a bit disheartening. Also, yes, it is odd seeing tweens (11 year olds to be specific) tackle such serious topics so seriously, even though Satoru managed to get them to believe this was role play, all except for Kenya who knows what`s up. Maybe if these guys were around the age of 15, it would be more understandable in a lot of ways. Well, it was nice seeing them all get happy endings at the end of the show, even if the ending two episodes rival Death Note's finale in terms of disappointing endings.\\n\\n\r\nART: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nDespite how terrible A1 Pictures' working conditions are, hell that could be said for most production studios except Ufotable and KyoAni, one can generally expect good looking animation from them, if the likes of Fairy Tail and SAO have taught you anything. This show, is no exception. Some of the environmental effects look great, and overall, the show looks great. As for the directing, it is superb. Coming from a guy who isn`t likely to talk about directing, since I hardly know jack about the whole deal, that says something. I might not have known just how good it was, if not for Mother's Basement, a YouTube channel you should definitely watch. There are many cool bits like Satoru getting pushed to do something only to land at the beginning of the next shot, that really impress me, just like in Kabaneri of the Iron Fortess. It's the little things that count. Also, while I'll touch on the opening song a bit later, the directing is rather impressive there, always having more than enough stuff moving to not only keep your eyes plastered to the screen, but new tricks and sights to see if you merely slightly adjust where you look. Also, the vibrant shading colors for the ending were a treat as well.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack done by Yuki Kajiura is still a pretty decent soundtrack that covers a few different tones, even if I personally much prefer her work on Fate/Zero. There`s not a whole lot to say about the OST. I don't really remember anything of it, but I remember that regardless, the music was pretty good, again, much like Kabaneri. ALSO like Kabaneri, both the OP and ED were fantastic. The OP was the best thing to ever come out of the band Asian Kung-Fu Generation, as the song was very interesting and catchy, which perfectly blended with the beautifully directed visuals. The ending, managed to do one better,with a greatly emotional piece that really captures beauty, sadness, and scale. It was pretty great.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nCool characters, interesting setup, and great directing aside, I definitely got pissed at points. The ending of episode 10, and beginning of episode 11, made my gorge rise so high, it would take a while for that gorge to rise so high in the way a crappy ass plot or plot twist does it, only to be quickly refilled by the craptacular, Blazblue Alter Memory. Also, episode 9 left such bitterness within me as well for how badly it screwed up what was supposed to be the most satisfying moment of the whole show. The ending left such a bitter taste in my mouth, that seeing what satisfyingly amazing futures these guys all have wasn't enough to rectify it. However, a lot of the earlier episodes were still interesting and made me feel like this for the most part would be worth it, and even with the rage inducing moments of the last 4 episodes, I'd still say to some extent, the good outweighed the bad.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 6/10       RAW SCORE: 64/100\\n\\n\r\nAs you can no doubt tell, this show is no masterpiece. It already has a few problems in he first 3/4 before diving off a cliff in the end, even despite the great directing, the fact that ot is true widescreen instead of the usual ratio, and the fact that the OP, ED, and visuals are amazing, this was at least an ambitious attempt. Even though it somewhat failed as a time travel story, absolutely failed as a mystery (even though t wasn't entirely trying to be one), and STILL somewhat failed as both a story and an adaptation (from what I've heard), I'd say this is still an interesting series to watch, and honestly, no wonder this is one of the most popular shows in recent memory, and no wonder it's rather polarizing for a show with such a high score. Well, with all that said, I bid you adieu.",

            "content": "Story -7-\r\nSatoru has always had the ability to go back in time, but only as far as 5 minutes, and he uses this power of his in order to change some type of outcome. He doesn\u2019t know why he\u2019s been given this ability, but he more often or not gets himself involved in these possibilities of changing the outcome, even while scolding himself for doing so. However, after he is framed for murder, the stress causes his ability, revival, to activate, teleporting him back in time to when he was a child. Now he must figure out what he must do to change the pastso that the outcome is different when he becomes an adult once more.\\n\r\nOverall, the plot is simple to follow. However, it is very interesting, as there are many twists and turns that you\u2019re not exactly expecting. The one down side is that I was personally able to figure who the \u2018villain\u2019 was rather easily, so the \u2018surprise\u2019 wasn\u2019t so surprising. This does deal with somewhat pressing topics, such as child abuse and the responsibility people have for their actions. This makes the anime feel a bit more for adults in that sense, but it still is a wonderful watch.\\n\\n\r\nArt -8-\\n\r\nThe art style in Boku dake ga Inai Machi seemed to fall into the more \u2018modern\u2019 type of style, meaning that the characters looked a bit more realistic, but not to the point of classical anime style. I particularly liked how Satoru\u2019s mother\u2019s lips were drawn, because they were fatter and more pronounced as an older woman\u2019s should be, making them different from other styles of thin mouths that other, younger, characters had. \\n\r\nAs this anime does deal with time travel, there was some aging needing to be done to the characters. I was very impressed with how well they aged the characters. They didn\u2019t just copy the face and draw around it, but kept parts that wouldn\u2019t change as they got older and aged everything else, making it look more natural than other attempts I have seen before.\\n\\n\r\nSound -7-\\n\r\nThe voice acting was pretty average throughout. There were no real points that I felt like the voice actors were straining or trying particularly hard. It was important that the younger and older voice actors for Satoru sounded like a younger and older version of the same character, rather than two different characters completely, and thankfully they were able to succeed in this. The background music was average, as there was no real soundtrack that stood out. They were able to keep the mood in mind while playing these background tracks, so there was nothing truly notable.\\n\r\nThe reason the sound gets a bit higher is because the opening song was absolutely amazing. It really did capture the vibe of the whole anime, and was always a good way to start off the episodes. The opening theme of the anime is very important because it has to condense the view of the world and the feeling of the anime in the course of about a minute. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter -8-\\n\r\nSatoru, as a main character, was actually one of the more tolerable main characters in an anime as of late. He was shown to be first very apathetic to the whole world, and as the series goes on, he grows emotionally, having him learn how to connect with people and what it means to really care for different people. His development as a person was interesting to watch and really did hold meaning to it. His friends were all important, though there were a few static characters, such as one of his friends who was just there, and never really did much within the anime.\\n\r\nThe one downside to the characters was the villain of the series. While they did a good job in describing their character, they left out the background, which was included in the manga. This being left out actually made the character\u2019s motives a lot cloudier and honestly not that believable. In the end, the villain became more of a joke by the end of the series, even though they had done horrible things throughout the entire plot.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment -9-\\n\r\nThis series was something that either you loved or you hated. The subject matter was very sensitive and the way it dealt with child abuse was very blunt. Not to mention that most of the time when sexual assault is being talked about, one would expect it to be adults speaking about it. Instead, the series has children talk about these issues, which can make it very uncomfortable for some people.\\n\r\nHowever, when looking past these sensitive topics and uncomfortable plot points, it was very enjoyable. The story was well thought out and it was never truly clear where it was going to end up. The main issue it had however was that the ending episode was rather rushed and not that well thought out. It would have been far better if they had been able to work longer to make the villain less of a joke and make the ending a bit more thought out.\\n\\n\r\nOverall -7.8-\\n\r\nComing in at a close 7.8, this series was definitely something that deserves a lot of the praise that it was getting when it was the \u2018thing\u2019. From enjoyable art styles, to above average character development, it had every right to be considered so well done. The art style stayed particularly close to how the manga was drawn, which is always a good thing, as it was able to attract those who read the manga and kept a connection to its source material. The way Satoru slowly grew and was able to find out what was really holding him back in life made the anime connect to those who are also struggling to come to terms with what they did in the past.\\n\r\nThis being said, the ending of the anime and how much it differs from the manga was not a good choice. I understand that animes have deadlines that they have to reach and often they have to change certain parts of the manga to compensate for the time crunch. However, the way that they changed the ending actually worked against them, as it wasn\u2019t really clear why certain things were being done and what connection Satoru had to all of it. This was one of the few downfalls this anime had and that majorly effected how the anime was received. Overall, Boku dake ga Inai Machi was able to transition from manga to anime rather well, if not for a few bumps along the way.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I think this anime was amazing. I absolutely loved it. The opening song was actually was drew me to the series and I defintely dont regret watching it.\r\nI wouldnt know how to rate the art. I wasn't a fan of the character design, but the backgrounds and minor details were done excellently in my opinion. I wasn't a fan either of the adult voice actor for Satoru. If I had to rate my enjoyment of the series, I would give it a full 10/10, but if I were to rate it on a more objective level, I think the series fails in several areas.\r\n[SPOILERS FROMHERE]\\n\\n\r\nFrom a logical stand point, several areas of the series didn't make much sense. The biggest being the scene where Yashiro locks Satoru inside the car. Satoru tries to yank the seatbelt free, but that just seemed illogical to me. It obviously wasnt coming out. Satoru had leaned forward earlier in the scene to open the glove compartment, proving the seatbelt wasnt locked and could be loosened, so why not loosen the seatbelt and slip out over or under it?\\n\\n\r\nThe other big one that seems the most controversial is the entire time travel concept. Some think it was poorly developed, some say its not important as its just a plot device. Im of the opinion its poorly developed. When does he develop the ability (He clearly didn't have it as a child)? Why did Revival send him back 18 years in the past? Its convenient for the plot, but I believe Satoru states that the purpose of it was sort of to prevent an incident from occuring. 18 years isn't necessary for that. Why not a few minutes or like normal or maybe a few hours so the main character can get home before the killer does. Going back 18 years does get to the root of the original problem, but then what about the first incident that occurs? Why not send Satoru back a few hours so he can stop the man before he gets in the truck or before he gets a heart attack? Why would he suddenly lose the ability (or does he given the butterfly at the end)? It also seems to just be a bit convenient that Satoru was able to will himself back in time when he's getting arrested as opposed to how he was forced prior. The anime fails to address these issues in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nIf you dont think too hard about all this though, the anime is quite good",

I actually enjoyed this anime because it gave me a Steins;Gate feel as I really enjoyed that anime. I would recommend this anime if you really enjoy mystery and psychological anime, be my guest and try this anime out. Although I didn't fully enjoythe anime due to my experience of having interests in other anime, the story was actually extremely unique to the point where you want more. In this anime, I find it unique where the opening would match the time period in where Boku Dake ga Inai Machi takes as the opening theme was made in 2004. Overall, although there might be some parts of the story that people might not like, I would recommend this anime to new anime watchers who want to get a sense of the combination of psychological and mystery genre.",

            "content": "This is my first review, so feel free to give me constructive criticism.\r\nOh Erased. I remember when the first episode came out and the entire anime community was hyping it up as one of if not the best anime they've ever seen. Now, I'm just going to say right now. This is something you should never do. There are many shows with very captivating first episodes that quickly go downhill as weeks go by and Erased is unfortunately one of those shows. The story is about a 29 year old manga artist and pizza delivery man, Satoru Fujinuma. Satoru has a mysterious power dubbed \"revival\"which can send him back a few seconds to prevent deaths or serious injuries. One night, when Satoru comes home from work, he finds his mother lying dead on the floor, with the killer just leaving the scene, tipping his hat to Satoru. Satoru gets the bright idea to run up the the body and get blood on his hands, causing his neighbor to blame him for the murder and call the police on him. When Satoru tries to go back in time to prevent this death, he goes all the way back to 1988 when he was in grade school. It was around this time that that same killer was killings little girls from his class, and Satoru, now knowing this, decides to solve the mystery of who this killer is, and stop him in his tracks. Sounds good right? Well, the story did have A LOT of potential but unfortunately, it fails to live up to any of it. The show is classified as a mystery, and it's clear that Satoru's main goal is to find out who the killer was. The problem with this is that the show made it way too obvious who the killer was. I was able to pin point it by episode 3. In fact, if you pause at the right time in the opening, it literally shows you the killer's face. This ruins the entire point of the show. A mystery show is supposed to make you think and theory craft as to who the killer is and why he would be committing these horrible crimes. To do this, the show must present at least 3 plausible suspects for who the killer could be and focus on each of them equally, giving the viewer time to get to know them, and use their brains to deduce who the killer is. Erased unfortunately gave us one plausible option and wasn't very subtle with it either. I won't spoil who the killer is, but if you decide to watch the show, I won't be surprised if you figure it out by episode 2 or 3. Another thing wrong with Erased is its characters. Very few are fleshed out. Satoru, Kayo (one of the victims of the killer) Satoru's mother, and arguably Kenya (Satoru's best friend) are the only characters to be fleshed out at all in the story, when there are plenty more characters that seem like their just there to be there and add little to nothing to the story. The biggest example of this is Airi, Satoru's co worker. We did get some neat interactions between the two and I'm the manga, her character was fleshed out and likeable, but here, she's just a forgettable one dimensional girl who appears for like, 3 episodes if that. We get a brief explanation of the killer's motives but in the manga, we get treated to his entire backstory and learn more about his motives and why he mainly targets little girls. Although I will give credit where it is due. The art and animation are very good, and the music (especially that opening) is top notch. Other than that, I see nothing but wasted potential here, and as a manga reader I can definitely say that the manga is better. It fleshes out more of the characters, it makes the killer less obvious and adds a whole new arc to make up for the anti climactic ending. In the end, Erased gets a 5/10. The ideas were there, but little was done with them.",

            "content": "[Warning: This review contains spoilers, read at your own risk.]\r\nWinter 2016: the season when I finally lost what little respect I had for the MAL ranking system.\r\nI first read the Boku Dake ga Inai Machi manga a few weeks before the season started, and although I thought it was pretty stupid, I would have been content to let it lie in the realm of mediocrity.  However, then the season started, and pretty much everyone on MAL started praising it like it was the Second Coming of Evangelion/FMA:B/Steins;Gate...\r\nSuffice to say it's a sad statement about the anime industry and fanbase as a whole when amediocre work can gain this much acclaim just because it doesn't pander.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY- 4/10\\n\\n\r\nI'll admit, BokuMachi might have hooked me early on.  The premise of an apathetic adult having to go back in time to set right the wrongs of the past, is not the most original out there, but the added twist of him being put into a nine-year-old body and having to stop a serial killer was a little unexpected, and the story type can be done well.  However, in most cases it's not.  In most cases the main character ends up easily solving the issues of everyone and riding off into the sunset, and this is most cases.  If you've only watched episode one and thought \"hey, this seems pretty good!\", don't get your hopes up.  It just spirals down from there.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem with this is, that just like every other part of the story, it's a good idea bungled horribly.\\n\\n\r\nTo fully be invested in a race against time such as BokuMachi, there needs to be some kind of narrative stakes.  You, the viewer, need to get the sense the main character can, and is likely to, fail.  There needs to be suspense.  With this show there is none of that.  The protagonist's power to turn back time is basically a \"get out of jail free\" card.  Basically stated, there is nothing suggested to make me believe Satoru can't keep save-scumming, going into the past again and again until he finally succeeds, meaning he can do loads of stupid things and still get redo after redo after redo.\\n\\n\r\nSo how does the show make up for it?  Feels.  Lots and lots of feels.  Because as any fan of Key Visual Arts can tell you, the way to cover up writing problems is to toss wave after wave of cheap pathos at the reader/viewer until they're too overwhelmed by tears to think about the plot.  Because if they did, they would understand the fact that the story is actually pretty retarded.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of the story deals with child abuse.  Now, this is a touchy enough issue as it is, but you would expect a portrayal that addresses the subject with at least some narrative subtlety and makes an effort to show what effect it has on the psyches of the victim, the abuser, and everyone around them.  What we get, instead, is drawn-out, almost-cartoonish scenes of an caricature of an evil parent beating her child because evil.  Kayo never changes a single bit due to it, because we have no idea what she was like beforehand.  We never get to see how being abused affected her in the long run.  As a result, it comes off looking like it's solely for shock value, and using it as a plot device for easy sympathy almost seems insulting to real people who have actually gone through that.  Not helping is how one-dimensionally it portrays the subject; no sane person wakes up and thinks \"oh, it would be fun if I kicked the shit out of my kids today!\"  \\n\\n\r\nI hate trigger warnings.  I really do.  But if someone were to get triggered over this, I would completely understand it.  Portraying such a horrible subject like BokuMachi does really isn't okay.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and why does the protagonist resolve to protect this girl from her abuse?  Not because he is forced to do so in order to save his mother's life (which is actually something that is going on in the story), but because he wants to befriend everyone and be a seigi no mikata.  Yes, it's the power of friendship, which has no business showing up in a seinen manga-adapted series this dark but is inexplicably being played 100% straight.  After Kayo's story gets resolved, this element climbs to an absolute max, where Satoru, in complete seriousness and in an extremely rushed and shallow plotline, attempts to befriend all of the murder victims to stop them from being killed...because a little kid is definitely gonna be able to protect another little kid from a serial killer who targets little kids.\\n\\n\r\nI was also really uncomfortable with Satoru and Kayo's relationship.  As in, what was the point of all the hand-holding, calling their outings \"dates\", and everybody, including Satoru's mother, being okay with it or outright encouraging them?  They are eleven years old, people.  I don't know about you, but my hypothetical child is not going out with anyone until they hit puberty at the very least.  So I don't see any reason why only having their interactions be friendship would take anything away from the story itself (admittedly, there isn't much to take away in the first place).  Not to mention, the fact that the protag is an adult in a little kid's body, but actually gets turned on by Kayo at one point, is all sorts of disgusting.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then there's the ending.  The tiki umbrella in this mai tai glass of failure, so to say.  The killer turns out to be...the only adult male who interacts with the children on a regular basis, and who was most viewers' prime suspect.  As if that wasn't enough, suddenly the writers realize that they were going way too slow to adapt the ending of the manga properly and start throwing twist after twist at the viewer like it's a game of Touhou or something, letting plot holes abound.  Satoru somehow gets put in a coma...despite being drowned in a car going into a frozen lake.  Where is the explanation?  Nowhere.  Then in one of the most bafflingly stupid decisions by a bad guy I've seen in a long time, the villain decides to go to Satoru and tell him everything despite the fact that he has no good reason to do so.  Surprise, surprise, Satoru regains the memories he lost in the attempted murder because the bad guy was basically incriminating himself!  And then we find out the bad guy did this because...he had a crush on Satoru or something.  Yes.  That's the reason.\\n\\n\r\nOne last thing.  Whichever executive at Aniplex of America who thought the English title was a good idea should be taken out back and put out of his misery.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS- 3/10\\n\\n\r\nWell, what more can I say?  Satoru, our MC, starts off as an apathetic jerk, someone who doesn't want to get involved in others' business.  I'll admit, I'm biased toward those types of characters, probably because I am one myself.  But the main reason I like those sorts of characters is the opportunity they have for development.  How do they interact with their setting?  In a lot of cases, their journey into the ideal hero is one of the most rewarding things that can happen in any sort of fiction.\\n\\n\r\nSatoru goes back in time as an apathetic jerk, fails once, then goes back in time again as Shirou fucking Emiya.  That is not logical development.\\n\\n\r\nThere's no explanation apart from a flaming cliche given to why he would suddenly want to save everyone, befriend everyone, be a hero, etc.  Remember that little part about his mother dying unless he changes the future?  Remember that reasonable motivation?  Yeah, neither does the author.\\n\\n\r\nIt seems like almost at times the story forgets that he's not an actual eleven-year-old, but an adult in a child's body.  His morality seems to be replaced with the simplistic, black-and-white judgement of a minor, which as we see in the prologue, he is obviously not.  Think about it.  What twenty-nine-year-old, in all seriousness, utters \"I want to be a superhero?\"  Still thinking?  Satoru Fujinuma, that's who.  The story completely drops the ball with every single bit of his character development and growth.\\n\\n\r\nThen we move to Kayo, the murder target and so-called deuteragonist.  She's emotionally cold and distant from other people.  Why?  Because her mother beats her and it makes her wary of others.  She likes going outside, like to the museum or the children's center and stuff like that.  Why?  Her mother doesn't let her go outside.  She wants a pair of mittens for her birthday.  Why?  Because her mother never let her have any.\\n\\n\r\nEVERYTHING ABOUT HER RELATES BACK TO HER BEING ABUSED.\\n\\n\r\nA main character is supposed to have depth.  She doesn't.  Get rid of the abusive parent and she pretty much ceases to exist.  Kayo is almost not so much of a character in her own right as a narrative device; a MacGuffin the main character has to obtain.  Replace her with an artifact from an RPG, and there would be about the same difference, minus the beatings of course.\\n\\n\r\nThe less said about Airi Katagiri, the better.  Seriously, she is irrelevant.  Remove her entirely from the story and almost nothing, if anything at all, would change.  It's even more absurd that MAL lists her as a main character despite the fact that she doesn't appear in more than half of the episodes at all.\\n\\n\r\nThen there is the little issue about Kayo's mother.  Apparently at the final confrontation the MC has with her, she gets a tragic backstory pulled out of her ass and it's implied you're at least supposed to feel at least a tiny bit of pity for her.  Sympathy, my fully extended, shaved, unaroused left testicle.  If you portray a character as a monster for ~8 eps, why do you think people will suddenly turn around and start feeling sorry?\\n\\n\r\nI have to say, I don't hate all the characters.  I actually found Satoru's mother rather realistic and likable, and someone who actually has the experience to back her views up.  Then there is Kenya (yeah, I actually remembered his name), who I liked the best out of all the irrelevant little school buddies for being the only one of them who actually thought about the plans and how to address them in a logical manner.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, two interesting side characters cannot make up for the two MCs' characterization flopping harder than the result of Neymar making consensual love to a ten-pound bass.\\n\\n\r\nART- 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI'll have to admit, the production values are very, very good for this show.  Say what you want about A-1 Pictures (I know I say a lot), but one thing you cannot fault them on is budget.  They know what they want to make, and they always have the money to do so.\\n\\n\r\nThe direction is quite serviceable, and although it's okay most of the time a few of the cuts and camera angles were absolutely Hollywood-cinematic gorgeous.  I was apprehensive about Tomohiko Ito being the director at first, but I've put those doubts to rest.  It's by far his best work to date, and he's really demonstrated he can move beyond being known as \"the guy responsible for Sword Art Online\" (to be fair, most of the problems with that weren't his fault) and into being a relatively well-regarded director.  It's a shame the talent he displayed had to be wasted on such a pile of mediocrity.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the art style is a bit odd in terms of A-1 standard character design, it's far better than the triangular faces and awkward shading that plagued the manga, and the muted color palette really fits the feel of the show.  I noticed no obvious glaring animation errors, either, which is always a good sign.  I don't like to be too harsh on art in general, but there was nothing much for me to criticize.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND- 6/10\\n\\n\r\nNothing to complain about with most of the seiyuu performances, although I have a bit of an issue with the MC's adult seiyuu, Shinnosuke Mitsushima, being very wooden and robotic compared to the others.  However, this is his first role in anime; he was a live-action actor until now, so I'm willing to overlook it.  The rest of the cast, including such names as Minami Takayama (Detective Conan, Envy) and Chinatsu Akasaki (Akira Aoi) is perfectly serviceable.  However, who really stands out is Aoi Yuuki (Madoka Kaname, Komachi Hikigaya) as Kayo.  The emotionless type is not a role she's had a lot of experience with in the past, being confined mostly to energetic lolis, but she plays it to perfection.  I also have to give props to the girls playing the little kids for not getting on my nerves, which is a rarity in those kinds of cases.\\n\\n\r\nWould you believe that's Yuki Kajiura composing the music?  I really couldn't, because apart from one or two tracks, there's nothing I could identify as being distinctly hers; most are generic.  Suspense really isn't the genre for a composer known for \"epic\" soundtracks.  This definitely isn't Kajiura at her best, and at this rate I really wonder how long it's gonna be before she just stops composing at all.  Her best years are pretty clearly behind her.\\n\\n\r\nSo, that marks the end of this review, and the first one I've done in a while.  If you were interested, thanks for reading, and see you around!\\n\r\n-Kaoru",

I can't recommend this anime enough. I advise you to watch it. Really, do yourself a favor by watching it!\r\nThis anime reached the 5th spot of top animes in myanimelist while it was still airing, beating even the likes of HxH.

            "content": "Erased: a great anime to watch, but even with it's rushed ending, it still is one of the best anime's of the year so far. Spoiler-free don't worry. I watches this the time it started to the time it ended, but I guess I'm late. \r\nStory: so a late-20's aged dude who is a struggling manga writer has this strange specialty of his that makes him go back in time (temporarily) to the event he chooses to. After his mom comes over to see him, he comes home one night...... and that should be it for now. The story is very good and has twistsand turns, great or just completely expected. The ending is the downfall of this show, which gave me the impression that with this tweaked better and a better pace to finish, than this would really be a 10. \\n\\n\r\nArt: some scenes show how great the art is in this show, but has to adapt to the overall setting of the town (that you will see later in the show). The art seems bland, but sort of gives the overall tone in specific scenes, which is fine with me. \\n\\n\r\nSound: the voice acting was pretty good for the most part, but the opening and ending song that goes on throughout the series was VERY addictive. The opening was made by the Asian Kung-Fu Genaration  (a very good band), and the ending is called Sore wa Chiisana Hikari no Youna. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: awesome characters. They, well most of them, give off some type of happiness and friendship that will give off one of the main themes the show is trying to convey to the audience. Some characters really go through changes as the series goes on, and creates shock, happiness, relief, and maybe some tears if you are easily moved by shows. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: I enjoyed this A LOT. HOWEVER, the ending rushed WAY too fast, but the ending wasn't enough for me to throw my computer like everyone else. Just keep an open mind like any show you watch and I will be sure you will be fascinated. 9/10",

            "content": "Amazing story, with a poor ending.\r\nWeeks ago I was talking to my friends amazing things about BDGIM, now sadly, I must change, slightly, my opinion about It.\r\nThe story, even though It doesn't offer us a lot of explanations, I think that this complaint about the time travel, is just plain unnecessary and childish. It does is a solid, agressive, and straightforward story, that sadly ends up with a very lazy, kind-of hurried ending, which wasn't as astonishing as the previous ten episodes (I am considering the ending as the two last episodes of the series). Considering these points, and the loss of quality in thedevelopment in the last two chapters, from giving It a ten on a previous review, I must change my opinion to an eight for the story.\\n\\n\r\nSome people disliked the art, but in my very own personal opinion, the art is very catchy, and does express the personality of the characters pretty well. I like It and It really ends up creating a true emotional tie with the characters. Sometimes the quality reduced, specially in the series ending, style is not very appealing for adult characters I must admit, but for the children, It was more than correct. Nine.\\n\\n\r\nI loved the songs in these anime, I really did, specially the ending. When we talk abou sound effects, It is just average. Opening and ending were amazing, Asian Kung Fu Generation, really gave a nice touch in Re:, which melts amazingly with the stories' mood, but what really keeps up the misterious mood was the ending; dark, melancholic and very emotionally intense. Eight.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are amazing, specially the villains (Yashiro and Akemi), they really make us feel an authtentic no-sense evilness, which is the worst kind of evilness you can found in real life, that sick madness for mistreating and killing people, in some times, just for pleasure. MCs are good, but lacked in some way of a more realistic behaivour (Satoru) after some events, Hinazuki was nice, but also, lacking of some necessary emotional response in some situations. SCs like Kenya were quite intriguing, but not fully developed, and also with an unrealistic behaivour towards what Satoru told him, which, even considering his age, sounded just very stupid. Nine, yes, even with the issues mentioned, the characters are pretty nice, I mean, these things are commonly found in bigger manners in much better reviewed animes, and no one is complaining about that.\\n\\n\r\nTotally enjoyable, intense, and that keeps you at the edge of the coach, well, at least the first ten chapters did. Is that kind of series which express the quality in front of the spectator, but also not denoting even a bit of mercy for what the spectator felts. Amazing, I will watch again sometime in the future if I have a chance. Ten.\\n\\n\r\nTen delightfully made episode, I was really amazed, until the tenth chapter, after that, the quality dropped, not dramatically as some people said, but yes, It does, and does the manga if you belive It was better, well, It wasn't, is as annoying as the anime's. A very tasteless ending which wasn't that bad, but compared to what the series offered from the beginning, then, yes, It's bad. The eding was hurried, out of tone, mood, and poorly managed. A lot of characters wasn't even developed a bit (Kenya, Hiromi), and some other weren't even mentioned again (Jun). It is a Slice-of-life feeling ending, for a psychological-thriller series, just, unbearable. The time travel issue wasn't necessary to be explained, It isn't that kind of series, get over It (A lot of animes doesn't explain anything of how things work, and I don't see a quarter of million people complaining about It).\\n\\n\r\nBoku Dake ga Inai Machi, damn, yes, I will still recommend It, It is that good, maybe the best of the season, but with a very forgettable ending, really, at the point that made a 10/10 series in a 8.8/10 series. If you haven't finished watching It, well, I will recommed you to watch until the tenth chapter, give It a break, and then watch the last two chapters as an alternative ending, I think, It is the best thing you could do with series. It does deserve a remake with a new ending, even if It's not the manga's.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Veredict: 9/10 (Because I can't put a 8.8/10 in MAL lol).",

Sadly this is only affects 1/3 of episodes the rest of the anime feels really rushed and theinterest fades away.\\n\\n\r\n***************ART*********************\\n\\n\r\nWell if you dont like the story of this anime and the genres of this anime. The art will amaze you, everythings made great but the most interesting part in this production is how every detail mattered from a simple background to a tiny snowflake this type of art shows the power of cinematography and increases feel of the story it makes you more drawn to it.\\n\\n\\n\r\n**************Sound********************\\n\\n\r\nSound used very well here, again it's used more of cinematography feeling, When characters thinks or tries to express there feelings music is often played witch again good for cinematography but bland for characters.\\n\r\n*personally i watched Russian dub version, cant say nothing about Eng dub.*\\n\\n\\n\r\n*************Enjoyment*****************\\n\\n\r\nI really envy you if you skipped this anime and waited this long for a full release. If you gonna watch now you gonna have a better time than me, mostly cause you will see everything in one sitting, basically how i did was wait for 1 month and watch 4 episodes once, and repeat same stuff, but in the end i got mixed results. So 1/4 of anime you will definetelly love 2/4 - the thrill will fade away but will keep you on you're toes and the 3/4 - will dissapear because how FAST everything goes. Personally i think this anime deserves 20 episodes rather than 12. But none the less i've spent good time watching this series, i hope there will more like these animes.",

When I said human, I really mean it like a HUMAN. Like us. Normal. Something that portray us and not too fictional. \r\nAnd Boku Dake Ga Inai Machi has just made it. With so much suspends included, I could not even stop watching and I got very irritated when I was not able to continue. I am a sucker for this kind of story.\r\nStarting with the main character, Satoru. \r\nFor me, Satoru is a realman. He may not be your typical hero, but he is just how he is. I am totally satisfied with him. Satoru gives a real feeling of a guy/man. You are going to feel like, he is a common man which you may find around you. However, what makes the story interesting is; that very common person who gets something extraordinary. \\n\\n\r\nI really love some lines from Satoru. He said that, in order for everyone to be happy, he would need to sacrifice for them and not seeing them enjoying their merry moments. \\n\\n\r\nOther characters which I found superb are;\\n\r\nThe mother, the friends, the victims, and others. Well, it's better not to mention who are they. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this story might be said by some people to be overrated. But hey!\\n\r\nIs there any more realistic anime like this? Maybe there is.

            "content": "Looking at the current generation in the anime production, there are many shows that could exhibit a trend that relates especially to those that observe them closely. Unfortunately, the recent ongoing are presenting decent story plot and in other aspect of the anime. However, in almost every seasons, there are always a few shows that have potential to prove the community a masterpiece is about to come to life. (But whether they could do it is another story).\r\nAnd here we have, Boku dake ga Inai Machi.\r\nSet in the year 2006, Satoru Fujinuma, a 29 years old manga artist, has a special ability known as \"Revival\",in which he would travel back in time several seconds, to grant him an opportunity to help on a crisis event which is usually life-threatening issue. On a fateful day, Sachiko (Satoru's mother) visited him for certain reasons. As the episode continues, she managed to deduce a man who was responsible for the incident that happened 18 years ago. This, in return, caused the said man to come to silence her which costed her her life. As things turned unfavorable, with his \"revival\", satoru was taken back to the year 1988, when he was still an 11 years old elementary school student.\\n\\n\r\nAnd this isn't the beginning yet.\\n\\n\r\nBoku dake ga Inai Machi, as many has also refer it commonly as 'Erased', is a mystery show filled with many interesting details and a smooth flow of mysterious stories. The stories were reveal in Satoru's perspective and each episode is able to catch the viewers' attention, resulting most of them to ask for more. As the refreshing stories were pleasant, both the opening and ending theme songs fit them perfectly. The opening theme song was adequate enough to bring the viewers back into the show. And the ending theme matches the finish scene to end with a strong desire of wanting the next episode.\\n\\n\r\nThere are many positive factors in Boku dake ga Inai Machi but not all anime are perfect. There are always bound to have flaws - which is either minor enough that most would accept and still satisfied with the show or major to the point that the viewers have to point out their frustrations and disappointment.\\n\\n\r\nNow I'll move on to the flaws that concern this anime.\\n\\n\r\nIn Boku dake ga Inai Machi, the issue though is, some may have grasped the truth in the early episodes. As it's critical to hide the truth to the viewers in mystery shows, this could cause serious damage to some of the viewers in the aftermath.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the flaw does not end here. As there are many things that are fresh and interesting, there is roughly an equal amount that were left unexplained. With this, the show become a paradox. This, thus, create a divide between the viewers, in which one who isn't disturbed by it or the other that is unease.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, the flaws in the show does not affect me as much as it may have done to the other viewers. Hence, in my honest opinion, this show could have the potential to become a masterpiece. But the noticeable flaws are are keeping it from achieving the best and a position in one of the top place.\\n\\n\r\nNote:\\n\r\nI'm aware of some bad reviews in this show. As a viewer and reviewer myself, your ultimate decision lies in yourself. And I am completely acceptable when others have different opinions as compared to mine.",

            "content": "I'm not going to try and be a wannabe reviewer who tries to over criticize to get the cynicism out of people, or am I going to fanboy this show until everyone hates it. Instead, I will give my thoughts on the show in a hopefully brief fashion because Myanimelist won't let me sum this show up in about a sentence or two. \r\nIn a nutshell, this show is good, probably better than most shows that have come out in recent years and will definitely get you hyped with each episode. It certainly isn't as bad as the critics on here want you to think,and it isn't as great as the fans make it out to be. \\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nGood. Gets you emotionally charged up and makes you hate/love some characters which is what any good show will do to its viewers. Only problem I had was it didn't focus on some parts I thought would make the experience a whole lot better. Especially later in the show where it just kind of throws stuff at you and you just got to catch all the information in your arms awkwardly because you weren't expecting it so now you gotta figure out what to make of it. And it's kind of predictable to some.\\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\r\nOkay. Not overwhelming. No god-tier animation or entirely memorable art style. But it gets the job done and has some damn good cinematography. They certainly make the best with what they got and I wish a lot of other anime followed in their footsteps on that one. \\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nSets the mood. Apart from that the only thing you're probably gonna take out of the soundtrack is the opening and ending, which I think were pretty dandy. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThis show had some pretty interesting characters, however, it didn't showcase how really interesting they were. Satoru's mom was pretty notable in my book but I don't feel like they focused on her enough, or presented her well. The same could be said for other characters, some not receiving there spotlight and just disappearing in the show. \\n\\n\r\nDespite me saying negative things about it or just saying its average in some areas, that by no means I didn't enjoy this show. I enjoyed the hell out of it. It was the only thing I had to look forward to this boring anime season. And it didn't betray me in that respect. I was anxious to watch each episode because every episode was a rollercoaster of emotions that had me coming back for more...\\n\r\nThat and you don't care about the positives of the show, you only want to read about the negatives. People are pessimistic like that.\\n\\n\r\nScores don't mean much. I can only recommend you give it a shot and see if its in your ballpark. To me its definitely a break from standard Japanese anime and it kind of felt like watching an American mystery show, which is refreshing",

            "content": "First i like to say that i rarely give a short anime a 10 RATING !! very rare. however this anime highly deserves a 10 star rating. \r\nLiterally within the first episode your immediately locked into the anime. It drags you in and makes it very suspenseful for the watcher. Its actually a very simple story line to follow, however what does get complicated is the dates and the time jumps back and forth and Satarou (main character) \"Revival\" scenes. Once you can follow that you can deff get into this anime. \r\nThe art was very refreshing and enjoyable to watch. I really like theart style in this one. Sound was pretty good as well. Voice actor for the main character is actually new and he made a great impression with being his first role. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters are what make this anime unique. I think the character development was amazing and nicely done. Even minor characters had some substance and purpose to the plot line. You really get to see the bond and relationship between Kayo and Satarou get in-depth . And its not rushed either the thing with 12 episode anime's is that everything seems rushed and compacted. Literally you dont feel that at all for this. Each episode had a meaning and purpose behind it and the final episode wrapped up everything. \\n\\n\r\nAll i have to say is if you like suspense, thriller, simple plot line, and some time traveling involved definitely check out this anime. Its short but very enjoyable, every episode i watched i always was on edge and craved more. Its one of those few short animes that have substance to it yet very enjoyable to watch.",

It is more than just psychological and time travelling. \r\nThe author has expressed his introversion in an awesome way! It may not get a big hit with kids. However, any matured mind would appreciate the way the story moves. The ending is a gem! \r\nThis anime topped my anime list especially after the 12th and the last episode. Perfect ending! I'd give an overall 10+/10 for this anime. \r\nArtwork - 9/10 Not so impressed with the artwork than the story itself. However the screenplays are really good. They have giventhe seinen look in the art without making a big fuss of giving bright color tones; not a tarnished artwork either. It was good.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 10+/10 People would think that they have solved the mystery after watching the 10th episode but honestly they wouldn't be 100% sure as the prediction was dissolved with a prank at an earlier episode. The idea of giving enlightenment to the protagonist with unpretentious yet extensive dialogues deserves an applause. The protagonist was neither the harem king nor the boasting one but a person of sophisticated simplicity which is an admirable one. The author emphasized more on giving message rather than giving a thriller feel. People have misunderstood this to a greater level.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10/10 The opening song, its music, visuals and the lyrics are awesome! They have even modified the visuals in the opening of 11th episode so as to perfectly suit the story and the title! I loved the ending song at the last episode. It was soothing and daunting!\\n\\n\r\nI liked the character designs which suited their personality. Totally it was enjoyable! I would like to thank the author for giving us such a good anime.",

Did another binge to finish.\r\nI really really liked this anime up until episode 10. Every episode before 10 was easily a 9.5 or 10/10 and I was eating it all up I loved it, so well written and left you wondering and wanting so much more. Then episode 10 hit, it broke a major rule of time travel. After the 10th episode I was so unhappy about the outcome, Yes this is because the romance lover in me wanted Satoru to bewith the main girl (you'll know who I am talking about when you see past episode 3), I am so so hating the new timeline. \\n\\n\r\n**********This does contain a potential spoiler read at your own risk I am trying very hard not to give anything away so please be warned! I do not want to ruin this for anyone!*********************************\\n\\n\r\nDo not get me wrong this is an amazing anime and it did phenomenal on the story and made it interesting to say the least but, this new timeline was so reminiscent of Rumbling Hearts and I hated how that turned out too. If you have seen that, you most likely can figure out to an extent what is going to happen.\\n\\n\r\nI am really glad I did not watch this as it aired or I would have gone crazy waiting for another episode, this was really a great story and I loved it but the last 2 episodes in my opinion should have been re-written to go back to the not major rule broken timeline. In the end, this anime leaves me wanting way more than it gave me. And honestly, not in the good way, the last 2 episodes just were a giant \"Hey you know those feelings you developed and you totally would ship it? Well nope we are going somewhere else so you end up voting us at a 4/10\" Seriously I really really hope they do a movie of this anime, but stick to the sub plot (that we all freaking want) Storyboard you know da*n well what I am talking about! DO IT FOR US! YOU KNOW WE WANTED IT! \\n\\n\r\nWould I watch this again? Maybe when I forget what it was about and what not, right now? No I need to go and watch something that serves my romance fanboy addiction. \\n\r\nRecommend? Before episode 10 I was all over it! After episode 10 I am very hesitant to do so.\\n",

            "content": "Boku Dake Ga Inai Machi (or Erased, just for the sake of abbreviation) was probably the most interesting anime title that came out during the Winter season of 2016. And it's not too difficult to notice why: an attractive mix of a murder mystery, a dynamic time-travel concept and a gripping thriller would move anyone out of their caves. Curiously, and despite the various shortcomings, this experimental bag of genres works pretty well during the first quarter of the series, leaving a a lot of engagement that is presented in a very organic style. However, after the show reaches its mid-point, all the positive aspectsslowly vanishes as the characters grow quite stale, the pacing of the mystery starts going in circles and a conclusion that leaves a lot to be desired.\\n\\n\r\nErased story goes around the struggles of Satoru, your average part-time worker and mangaka that for a long time has had an occasional ability (which he calls 'Revival') that permits him to go back in time; normally to fix some problem present on his surroundings. Needless to say, this time-travel element can awake a lot of qualms on most viewers that actually know how inconsistent and convoluted a story can turn when said element is misused to the point of breaking the plausibility or even contradicting some logic of the time-related aspect. Fortunately, this never happens...with the time-travel aspect. Meaning, that this part of the show is simply a gimmick employed to add some attractive aesthetic, thing that works well if not over-analyzed. There is a huge amount of convenience that comes from this aspect, though.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot begins when the mother of the main character (Satoru) getting killed by a mysterious serial murderer, and after a lot of silly coincidences Satoru ends up escaping from the police...only to be taken back in time by the 'Revival'. But, instead of the small amount of time which he usually travels, now he moved almost 20 years backwards! Then, at that past timeline, he begins to think that his mother murderer can be related to the death of his old schoolmate Kayo, that curiously happened during the week he has just been send to.\\n\\n\r\nThe most positive aspect of the series during its starting episodes is obviously the achieved atmosphere. When you know the MC has to rescue a girl from an imminent death, you would expect a good amount of tension and character perseverance; two things that the show incorporates splendidly. The constant snowfalls, the silent and potentially dangerous nights, a group of children that act so innocently. All this characteristics, though seemingly details, form a very solid amount of engagement to the series. I couldn't stop watching the first 4 episodes, everything related to the presentation was extremely well-polished. Also, when you truly can't tell who the real murderer is, it all turns very gripping.\\n\\n\r\nStill, problems are present on this part. Depending on how much attention you pay to the show, some flaws can be easily noticeable and thus quite annoying: like the fact that Satoru goes back in time with a body of a child but in reality he still has a mind of a mid-20s year old. To make it worse, this little problem gets a huge amount of emphasis because of the repetitive internal monologues that Satoru tells with his 20-year old mind, that also happens (mostly) during events he's in a serious or heartwarming moment with Kayo, unfortunately breaking the immersion and it even can encourage a very inappropriate romantic tension for some. Whether some other flaws (like the unnecessary victimizing) can be noticeable, it depends on what mindset you're on while watching Erased. But, generally, they're not too damaging\\n\\n\r\nAn despite the various cool aspects of its first episodes, those don't endure too much. After reaching the mid-point, the time-travel aspect comes out again to produce some conveniences that ruin the enjoyable pacing the plot was having at the moment. With that, is added a disappointing amount of predictability to the mystery, just making the culprit more or less obvious before the last episodes. This happens because of a constant repetition of events that goes like a 'I have to save them all!' premise. Instead of going to the point of the matter, the show cares too much about including an incommensurable amount of stupid drama, focusing on showing pity and shame instead of actual character struggle. In other words: it goes in circles with the same basic objective, even after it is fulfilled. To take it all down, the various revelations and even the ending ended up dumb because of these flaws.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes the entire experience even more disappointing are the very superficial attempts to develop some themes that are mainly about the family or the loss. While having a decent mount of drama to keep you in touch with the events, the cruelty of some adults and the reasons behind the killings feel too basic and distant to actually care about them. It basically develops from an intriguing mystery to a revelation with a level of simplicity that speechlessly treats you as a child in kinder garden. For example: It's later revealed that Kayo's mother hits her child because she suffered of the same trauma before, thing that never delves into a deeper perspective or insight.\\n\\n\r\nAnd, also, don't forget about the Drama tag on the genres description...which leads us to the characters section!\\n\\n\r\nSatoru is basically, as I wrote before, an average adult male that after a lot of moving events is forced (or motivated) to save Kayo in order to also save his mom. He's not a particularly relatable character, as his often altruistic nature feels more heroic rather than human. Kayo is a kuudere girl that's often hit by her mother, thus gaining the mentioned personality. She's the only character that gains some development, as she changes her personality to a more optimistic and caring side. Kenya is the typical cool blonde-haired guy that helps the main character to fulfill his goal. And Airi is a secondary love interest of Satoru that has very little screentime to care about. As you see, the cast of characters, though generally bearable, lack of enough depth to fill the gaps made by the tremendous amount of drama that's simply too overblown and excessive.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the production values, they're quite good. A-1 Pictures (Sword Art Online, AnoHana, Shin Sekai Yori) normally possesses good budgets, so the animation and art of Erased were certainly very nice. The color palette was leaning towards the cold, white and bright tones, well-fitting with the snowfalls and most of the characters personalities. The character design, for some reason, can be described as innocent: with different eyes drawings but the same childish and soft face design and shape. It's clearly not the kind of anime that focus on severe moments or big explosions, so the animation is just fluid for what it is. A very well presented show on this aspect.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is not particularly good, though. Most tracks are just repetitions of the ED theme (which is O.K.) in different instruments and pitches. Maybe some piano solos are the only moments Erased uses some variety. The OP theme, on the other hand, is quite likable. It's yet another song with catchy one-line phrases that only change its lyrics accompanied with another catchy main chorus; but it's still nice to hear, specially once the show reaches its worst parts. The seiyuu was solid but nothing too special. Average performance on this aspect.\\n\\n\r\nErased was a show that consumed my patience after it became too dumb for me to give a crap about it. Some interesting themes were going on, like family drama and other stuff, but the approach to it is just plain superficial and forgettable. About its current popularity, it's just a ridiculous fad that will fade away in some months, after another show takes its place (shame on modern viewers, really).\\n\\n\r\nTo sum it up, Erased is, more or less, a mess. Nothing particularly works out because of the basic characters, the mystery that unravels in a very stupid way and the forgettable finale. The interesting themes were taken down by the awful dramatic moments, and the soundtrack feels too recycled apart from particular piano tracks. If you are searching for a truly coherent and enjoyable time-travel anime that has believable drama and an extremely likable cast, stick to Steins;Gate. 'Erased' has just as much forgettable value as its name could allude to you.",

            "content": "It's done, and all I can say is... good. Finally. I originally started watching Erased because I heard good things about it. I wanted to give it a chance, but it ended up disappointing me. However, I also won't say this anime is trash or the worst thing ever. It's pretty bad, but not offensively bad. I don't like being overly cynical, and I wanna give credit where credit is due. So, let me finally go into some detail and explain myself. Vague spoilers be ahead.\r\n - Story [4/10] -\r\nOh, Erased... You had so many good things going for you: Interesting premise, nice animation, gooddirection, etc etc, but ya blew it, didn't ya? I think this is the category where Erased dropped the ball the hardest. It started off strong, though perhaps a bit shaky, but not too long after completely lost itself. The main issue here (which has been noted over and over again) is that Erased sets itself up as a mystery and then utterly fails to live up to it. It also tries to be a thriller, but it half-asses the mystery element so badly that the thriller element suffers heavily as a result.\\n\\n\r\nI think the author wanted to keep everything from Satoru's point of view as the unreliable narrator of the story but also didn't understand how to create a competent mystery with multiple suspects and red herrings. Nope, it's easy as pie to figure out, and it's exactly who you think it is. I had 'em pegged by episode 4. The author tries but doesn't succeed in any capacity. You just can't have your cake and eat it too unless you're legitimately that skilled at writing. \\n\\n\r\nOne other major problem is that the pacing is terrible. From episode 10 onwards, it gets so incredibly rushed. This should really have been a 24 episode show, and it ends without covering a lot of details it brought up earlier. I'm sure there's even more things like plot holes and whatnot, but I don't care enough to figure them out. Anyway, enough of the story, I'm getting annoyed just thinking about it.\\n\\n\r\n- Art [8/10] -\\n\\n\r\nThe art direction is one of two things I'll say is good in /most/ cases. The art style itself is pretty nice, albeit a little too cutesy for this kind of story. The animation is also pretty dang good and consistent overall. If there's one complaint I had to make is that it completely lacks any subtlety. I mean, really? Glowing red eyes to indicate murderous intent? The villain even gets a crazy smile after revealing that he's evil. That would be excusable if this show was a genuinely good mystery, but nope, it just comes off as cheesy and laughable. Subtlety is not always necessary, but for something in the mystery genre, it is crucial. \\n\\n\r\n- Sound [7/10] -\\n\\n\r\nSound is the other thing which I think qualifies as good. By good, I mostly just mean \"competent with no major issues\". The music is fine. Almost all of the seiyuu do well enough for what they were given. Once again, I have one issue, and that is the newbie seiyuu who voices adult Satoru. He's just so monotone and boring all the time. Like yes, I understand he's new, but he really is not showing any potential with such a limited range. Thankfully, much of the time is dedicated to child Satoru, so it's not like it's just adult Satoru all the time.\\n\\n\r\n- Character [5/10] -\\n\\n\r\nThere were two characters I can say I actually liked and got invested it. The first was Sachiko (Satoru's mom). She's the best mom, alright? The other was Kayo, whose arc ends 2/3rds of the way through. That's it. Satoru is boring, Airi gets shafted hard after the first few episodes, and Kenya is not a child, he's an automaton. The teacher, Yashiro... well, he has a nice character design and seiyuu. Uhhh, basically what I'm saying is that I thought he was cute, but that doesn't really make up for a badly written character. (I'll be looking for him on pixiv though)\\n\\n\r\n- Enjoyment [6/10] -\\n\\n\r\nEh, I can't say I hated watching this. In fact, I was really enjoying the beginning, but from the halfway point onwards, things started getting increasingly bad from a writing standpoint. Still, it never got to be, like, unbearable or anything. At least it was short. And yes, I know, I said earlier this show should've been twice as long, but that just means it would fix the pacing and maybe get rated slightly higher. I don't think more time would fix the author's lack of writing skills.\\n\\n\r\n- Overall [4.8/10 (D) rounded up to a 5/10] -\\n\\n\r\nI think I've said all that I wanted to say (at least without giving away more spoilers). I think I'm being fair when I say this show is as average and forgettable as it gets. It's not good. It's not terrible. It just has almost nothing about it that stands out to me. Just go ahead skip on this one, especially if you like mysteries.",

            "content": "I watched this a few weeks ago and didn't have much free time to write a reviews. I decided to write a review about my thoughts about the show since I am thinking what was the spring 2016 anime I don't regret watching the most. Erased is a time travel story like many others where the MC travels back in time to change something. I have been a fan of Steins Gate, All You Need Is Kill, Back To The Future and Doctor Who so a show about time travel is appealing to me. Usually a majority of time travel stories has continuity problems orthe story is to dragged on or messy to keep a viewers attention. Erase takes note of this issue and does not fall into it.   \\n\\n\r\nStory 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Erased focuses on Sotaru our MC who has a time travel ability that lets him go back in time to prevent tragedy's a few minutes before they happen. On one of these occasions he gets sent back years instead of minutes to when he is a kid in order to stop a 15 year old tragedy. I do not want to say what it is for spoiler reasons. It is a bit of a dark story with some dark themes. Apart from that The pacing in the story is perfect and they know where to end unlike many time travel stories seen in modern fiction where the writers do not focus on the delivery of an end.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art in the series is good especially mixed with all the lighting and snow. The character designs are not bland but are colorful and memorable. The antagonist had a interesting character design that made me think trouble was afoot with his appearance in some scenes. \\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThere is some good music in the original soundtrack but its does not leave and big impression on me. The only music that left a impression on me is the opening theme that gives a good vibe of what your going into. The most major sound effects used are snow and cars. The character voices are done well and fit the attitude of the characters. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOur MC his mother and some of his classmates are very intriguing characters that help move the story. The antagonist is interesting but not too interesting when I think about it. Most of the characters in the past timeline sit with me well but the characters in the future did not get as much development as needed to make the viewer think highly of their role in the story.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment  10/10\\n\\n\r\nI consider my enjoyment a ten because I watched the series in a total binge because I desperately wanted to watch the next episode. This usually how I know I'm enjoying the show. Also this show made me feel happy afterwards because did not feel like I wasted my time watching it.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n",

            "content": "Hello guys! This is my review on an anime that have recently finished airing, Boku Dake ga Inai Machi or ERASED.\r\nOkay so ERASED was the most hyped anime among all of the Winter 2016 anime as far as I know and then when it ends, it disappointed so many people out there, some of them even saying that this is just like Sword Art Online (in which I can't deny it fully since both are produced by A-1 pictures.) Okay so I personally think that ERASED isn't that bad. It's just average. So without further ado I'll review this anime.\r\nFirst of all, we have thecharacters called Satoru Fujinuma, in which acts like your typical shounen Seigi no Mikata (Ally of Justice), helping everyone in trouble with his 'revival' power, in which let him to time travel back to the past few minutes. He works as a pizza employee with a teen girl called Katagiri Airi, and also having a mom in which love him so much. To be honest the characters introductions were great, as well as in the end of the episode 1, the murder incident and Satoru's time travelling back to his childhood era makes us glued to what can actually happened next.\\n\\n\r\nSo then Satoru, believing the culprit of her mother's murderer was the same as his friends murderer during his childhood, he decided to protect his childhood friend while also try to findout the culprit while more characters were introduced within the story. Okay so here lies the first problem for me. Actually, by seeing on how the characters act, there's already a pretty big clue on how is this on the 4-5th episode, so basically, the major mystery ends here. The way of that culprit somewhat a bit nervous and contradicting his past words already makes that culprit very suspicious. But still somehow as a 29 years old in mentality, Satoru our protagonist, seems never noticed that.\\n\\n\r\nNext I'll talk about the first murder victim Kayo Hinazuki. Despite the story are based upon Satoru's POV, Kayo is actually the most well written character among all of the character. The way she act, is somewhat feels realistic for me. As a child who's being treated that bad, there's no way that she won't be mentally down and shut herself upon others and also having a bit paranoid. Also, her ending was realistic enough for me. No single problem with Kayo.\\n\\n\r\nSo what's the problem with this show? Why there's so much rants, complaints, etc upon this show? Okay so from now on, I'll tell you about the problem that lies within this show. There might be a little spoilers here but I'll kept it minimum.\\n\\n\r\nThe first problem of this show is that has a bunch of plot device on it. What are them? First, it's the 'revival' ability. Honestly this 'Butterfly Effect' ability sounds pretty unique for a person to have one, but until the end of the show, as probably other reviews told, this abilities was never explained or explored further. On the other hand, although this ability seems to come out randomly when there's a person who gets troubled, it also will loops our protagonist back to his childhood when he got caught by the police. Is this the rules or just a coincidence? We never know. It's never explained further within the stories. The background of other victims of the murder was never explained further too, which is also for me, counts as another 'plot devices'. As for Airi, she had at least some background on why she being nice to Satoru and so on, for people who saying that she's not a well written character, I'd like to say that based on her amount of screentime, she is a pretty well-written character (yep we need more of her screentime tbh.) There's plenty other 'plot devices' within this story (e.g Satoru's childhood friends, etc) but well let's just end this section.\\n\\n\r\nThe next problem of this story lies in the execution on the last 3 episodes. Most people said that the revealing was bad, but I'd like to say that it's not and it's perfectly normal, what isn't normal for me is when another major clue was introduced a.k.a the loli, Satoru still can't recognize the culprit. SO where's the problem within this part? So when this culprit decided to drown Satoru in the car, I found that it's pretty weird if he can't just slip below the seat belt to escape his fate, as his body is tiny enough to do that, not to mention that the car window was open wide.\\n\\n\r\nSatoru as a protagonist is well, pretty unexplored for me as a 'Seigi no Mikata' type of protagonist. And also sometimes although he is a 29 years old in mentality, sometimes he acts in reflex just like a 10 years old. Well of course he must act like one to avoid others suspicion, but sometime I found that his way of act is somehow like not pretending but a real, childish act.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the pacing, well I don't read the manga, but I feel that when Satoru tried to save his other schoolmates, it was clearly rushed. I can't tell on how he survived during the incident I said at the previous paragraph. Well I heard it's explained in the manga though, that's why I said it's rushed. And also as for the ending, some people might disappointed due the difference with the manga, but after I heard about how the manga ends, I found that the anime ending was far more realistic than the manga, considering Satoru's condition during that time. But still, there's some part on the last episodes about Kumi which is a bit miss for me because of the rushed pacing, but well I still can relate on what Satoru's did to her so that's not a very big problem for me. The culprit itself isn't that bad as a villain, he's just average for me, although his reasonings may be not that relatable, but at least he have one not like your 'evil for the sake of being evil' villain.\\n\\n\r\nSo was ERASED that bad? Not really. As an atmospheric anime fan, the scenery from Erased and the artwork was indeed a very well drawn, not to mention that the music which brought us to a mysterious and cool place in a winter during Shouwa era. As for me I liked the ED more than the OP, perhaps because I'm really into that kind of music. Perhaps this show had a big budget revolves around it so that they can make it that great. Also overall, ERASED was a quite enjoyable anime, despite of its major flaws.\\n\\n\r\nFor a story in which the main plot revolves around the time travel I highly recommend Steins;Gate, although I don't really like a hardcore Sci-Fi myself. The exploration of the theme, settings, and characters are somewhat better in that anime.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading my reviews and have a nice day.",

            "content": "[MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD]\r\nIf one were to look up the word \u2018overrated\u2019 in the dictionary I\u2019d really like the name of this show to be mentioned there somewhere. That\u2019s not to say this is a bad show. Overrated does not mean \u2018bad.\u2019 But at the time of this review, it\u2019s the 10th best anime ever made according to the users of MAL. Please. I like this show. I do. It was entertaining each week. But holy fucking shit was it stupid. This is not a proper review. You can read other reviews that give it a 10 or people who give it a 3, there areboth out there. This review is for my own self-satisfaction. Each episode, each week, there\u2019s been something that has driven me insane with frustration \u2013 small things that are just so unnecessarily stupid but the show does it anyway and expects us not to blink. Here is a list of these things. \\n\\n\r\n1)\tFirst of all, his power. How the fuck does this work? Is this seriously just a plot convenience for the writer? I was fine with it at the beginning where he couldn\u2019t control it and the sheer shock of seeing his mom dead put it into overdrive and sent him way further back than he\u2019s ever gone \u2013 I liked that. But then in a later episode he just wills himself back by yelling GO BACK. How can I buy into any tension whatsoever when we have the knowledge that he can just yell really loudly and go back in time whenever he wants? Hinazuki could die all she wants and he could just keep \u2018reviving.\u2019 There\u2019s no rule or consequence or known limit. It\u2019s just a plot device that allows the author to decide what time line we should go to next without having to actually write anything of substance. \\n\\n\r\n2)\tWhy does he run when he discovers his mom\u2019s corpse? No sane person would ever do that. That is literally the most suspicious thing you could do. A normal person would trust that people would not overreact and that the severe lack of evidence would prove him innocent. But no, Satoru bolts out the door like an idiot \u2013 which leads into my next point.\\n\\n\r\n3)\tAt the end of episode 1, the last place we see Satoru in the present time is running away from the police outside his door on the second floor with the police in pursuit. Later, when he returns, he\u2019s on the ground floor around the corner with nobody chasing him. What the hell happened? How did he get down there and why is nobody chasing him? Are the cops from Metal Gear Solid where they just forget he ever existed once they lose sight of him? If his location at that time changed because of something in the past, then the whole murder should have been different, no? So why? Oh right, because if Satoru returned to where he left he would be in front of the police and would get arrested and the story couldn\u2019t continue. Good job Author-san, you did it again.\\n\\n\r\n4)\tWhy did the killer light Airi\u2019s house on fire? There are so many fucking problems with this. First, the actual lighting of her house. He could have done it in 2 ways \u2013 1) light a small fire somewhere in the house and let it spread slowly or 2) fill the house with gasoline or some other kind of combustible substance and have it spread fast. Both have massive problems and unnecessary risk involved. In 1, the killer would have to rely on the idea that Airi is retarded and will never leave her room for any reason once while the small fire spreads. She will have to stay in there and not notice at all that there\u2019s a fire. If she went to the bathroom, or to the kitchen, or did any kind of normal house task she would notice the fire immediately and be perfectly fine. In scenario 2, he would have had to enter her house and made quite a bit of noise preparing the fire. Again, if Airi left her room at any moment for any reason she would see him immediately and killer-sans plan falls the fuck apart. \\n\\n\r\n5)\tAbout the Airi fire again, it seems the killers plan was to frame Satoru by having him text a phone of an arson victim making it look like he did it. Except\u2026 the phone would be completely destroyed in the fire, no? This one I\u2019m not 100% about but it just adds to the overall unreliability of this plan as a whole. \\n\\n\r\n6)\tFIRE ALARMS? DOES AIRI\u2019S HOUSE HAVE NO FIRE ALARMS? The only explanation for this is that the killer went with scenario 2, as listed in point 4, and entered her house to start the fire while removing the fire alarms at the same time. \\n\\n\r\n7)\tContinuing with the Airi fire, she opens the fucking door. Okay, I won\u2019t fault her for this. Reason being, nobody would expect a fucking backdraft outside their own bedroom door. Why, you ask? I did some backdraft research. Backdrafts occur in compartment spaces where there is no ventilation or air flow causing a severe lack of oxygen in the room. The room will then be searching for oxygen from any source; sucking it in (this is the main way to notice a backdraft, if you see smoke being sucked it at any point like under a door or through a window crack don\u2019t go near it, which is something that was absent from the show by the way). When oxygen is re-introduced quickly (such as when a door is opened) it will ignite and, simply put, result in an explosion. There are so many god damn issues with this being used in the show. First of all, these occur in compartmentalized areas where oxygen will be in short supply, such as a bedroom, NOT a hallway. From my understanding, for a backdraft to occur in the way it did in the show the rest of her house would had to have been on fire long enough to burn all of the oxygen in the entire house and it would also have to be completely sealed everywhere for no oxygen to come in. The unlikelihood of this is staggering. I can\u2019t even imagine how long the fire would have had to be going for this to occur, but it should be way longer than it takes for somebody to notice that their house is on fire. Backdrafts occur in buildings that are fucking infernos. Second, backdrafts literally kill firemen \u2013 you know, the guys that are fully geared for a fire. What happened to Airi, who was wearing a delightfully seductive casual outfit? Bitch got knocked out and charred a little (no permanent burns of course, because then people wouldn\u2019t like her anymore). The backdraft that occurred in the show seemed to consist of smoke only which doesn\u2019t seem quite possible to me and even if it were, the temperatures should be scalding enough to do some serious damage to Airi. But nah, the invincible waifu genki\u2019d her way through it once again. \\n\\n\r\n8)\tHoly shit why did Satoru meet with Airi? Was it not obvious to everybody watching that she was being watched/followed? Satoru can make some pretty intelligent deductions but in situations like this he is so retarded. But, of course, if he didn\u2019t meet with her (you know, like a somewhat competent person) then he wouldn\u2019t have the opportunity to get caught and yell himself back in time. Author-san, at it again.\\n\\n\r\n9)\tWhy the fuck is the blonde kid so smart? Being a genius or precocious is one thing, but no child has ever acted like him in the history of the world. He acts more like a 29 year old than the actual 29 year old. I knew this kid was bullshit the moment he took Satoru aside and asked him \u2018who are you\u2019? First of all, no fucking kid notices changes in any other kid. That\u2019s the one thing that is unanimously true among all children is that they\u2019ve not yet developed the ability to think that deeply about other people. But after less than a week, only a few hours a day, this kid notices enough of a change in Satoru that he asks him such an abstract question. And it\u2019s not even like Satoru is obvious about it. For some reason, Satoru\u2019s speech pattern adapted to that of a child almost immediately (something I\u2019ll touch on next). If he were talking like an actual 29 year old maybe I would give the blonde kid some credit for noticing, but literally the only difference that he could see was that he started caring about Hinazuki a little bit. Totally unbelievable. \\n\\n\r\n10)\tThis question doesn\u2019t even really need answering as the answer is obvious but, why is Satoru such a god damn pedophile? Why does he get all blushy, blushy with a legit 10 year old? Would any real person react like this? I\u2019ve rationalized it, for my own self sanity, that the reason he behaves this way and the reason his speech pattern changed perfectly is because, while his mind and memories are that of an adult, his body is still that of a child and therefore still feels what a child would feel. Sure, I\u2019m fine with this. What I\u2019m not fine with is the show not even touching on this slightly and forcing me to justify why his desire to hold hands and play doctor with this actual child isn\u2019t a pedophilic thought. Seriously, in one of the later episodes he\u2019s watching the door between him and a bathing loli and is blushing. What thoughts are you having Satoru?! And then later on the scene where he\u2019s sleeping with her and his mom and she says \u2018am I in the way?\u2019 to which he immediately responds \u2018yes\u2019 without thinking as if his primal urges to ravish this loli are about to burst. As funny as that scene was, what the fuck Satoru? Why can\u2019t the show at least casually mention him wondering why he wants to fuck a 10 year old and not leave it to the viewer to figure out why? Oh wait, Japan. Being an adult man that is attracted to young girls is a normal thing over there. \\n\\n\r\n11)\tA chocolate bar? A fucking chocolate bar? Why? Why the fuck is it a chocolate bar? This is a perfect example of this show being unnecessarily retarded in small aspects. How could a marriage fall apart because of something like this? Sure, one could say their marriage was at a breaking point and this pushed them over the edge. But what about his job? As far as I remember, he got suspended for 3 months for being accused of stealing a CHOCOLATE BAR. What?! Why?! Why even write this?! The author could have easily written something more believable and gotten the same result. Holy shit, how does this not fucking drive people crazy? \\n\\n\\n\r\n12)\tIn episode 9, when Hinazuki mom comes at Satoru mom with a shovel, the bitch doesn\u2019t fucking move. She doesn\u2019t even blink when the shovel is swinging at her head. If the two CHILDREN didn\u2019t react EXACTLY as they did her fucking head would have been caved in. Did she know? Did she know the two actual children would act just in time to save her? She made absolutely no effort to move. I get not wanting to look scared or not backing down but bitch you almost died. Again, a small thing that is absolutely retarded but we\u2019re not supposed to blink and just take it at face value. This god damn show.\\n\\n\r\n13)\tI don\u2019t understand how Yuuki was convicted. Okay, as far as I remember the incident went down like this according to police. Hinazuki\u2019s mom beat the shit out of her, put her in the shed for a few hours with the intention of taking her back in before she freezes to death, surprise, surprise Yuuki shows up and takes her out of the shed, brings her somewhere, sprays shit on her to speed up freezing, and puts her back in the shed before dawn. The mother, noticing this around 12:30, called around asking about her. The police report specifically mentions that her disappearance was between 10 and 11pm that night. How the hell do they know that? If the mother didn\u2019t even notice at 12:30, what evidence supports her disappearance during that time? Going forward with the report, there is an insane amount of detail here. How is any of this provable? The only evidence they have is the footprints in the snow and the autopsy. I don\u2019t think the autopsy results would provide such accurate numbers (time of death is one thing they can prove but the gap of time between supposed disappearance and discovery of body is at least 8 hours which is way too much time to determine anything in specific details; there\u2019s simply too many variables) and how are footprints enough to convict somebody? Does Yuuki have the only pair of boots in the entire town? After having read something about the police in Japan having a 99% conviction rate, I\u2019ll leave this weird and unbelievable police report, with more holes than a fucking honey comb, to the idea that the police in that time care more about convicting SOMEBODY than they do about actually solving the case. \\n\\n\r\n14)\tThis is less of an issue in itself but more of something that implies that other issues really shouldn\u2019t exist. This killer is smart. Unbelievably smart. The reason Hiromi dies is so insane that I feel like many people didn\u2019t think it through fully. Let me explain. Hiromi was murdered because he looks like a girl. Up to this point, I assume the killer has killed only lolis. The police know this, and the killer knows the police know this. So to throw them off his trail, he killed Hiromi, a male. Simple, right? Fuck no. The reason this worked is because the police reasoned that the reason he killed Hiromi, a target outside his pattern, is because the killer thought he was a girl. So logically, the killer should not be a person that knows Hiromi; a complete stranger. If he did know Hiromi, then he would know he\u2019s actually a boy, not a girl. So using this logic, they omitted all people who knew Hiromi from the suspect list in order to narrow it down. This is a really smart deduction but the crazy thing is that the killer would have had to predict ALL of this for his plan to work the way it did. That\u2019s INSANE. In other words, this killer is an actual genius and should never make any retarded mistakes ever. Haha. \\n\\n\r\n15)\tI just want to mention how cheap a character Hinazuki is. We\u2019re just supposed to automatically feel bad for her because she gets beaten by a laughably evil mother. This is the laziest possible way to draw sympathy for a character. At least if a reason was given it would be a bit better instead of the mother just being a senseless force of nature. \\n\\n\r\n16)\tWhy, God why, leave Hinazuki alone in a fucking bus? In what world is this the safest method? And shouldn\u2019t she freeze to death out there? What\u2019s the difference between a shed and an empty bus in terms of insulation? I just don\u2019t fucking get Satoru\u2019s logic. This show quickly became \u2018Satoru fuck up of the week.\u2019 I get hiding her somewhere the killer can\u2019t find her until the day of her death passes, but hiding her in public like that is straight up retarded. She\u2019s probably in more danger there than she is in her house where she gets regularly beaten.\\n\\n\r\n17)\tWhy isn\u2019t Satoru telling his mom about revival? It honestly seems like a relatively easy thing to prove if you remember any events from that time. On top of that, it is repeated throughout the show how intelligent and sharp the mother is \u2013 I find it hard to believe that she would shrug it off immediately. And if blonde kid can notice a change in Satoru, sure as hell his own mother (who, again, is supposedly a sharp as a knife) will notice too. Oh but wait, if he told his mother about it then every problem in the show would probably be solved. Sorry Author-san, I forgot how you write. \\n\\n\r\n18)\tSo many times I\u2019ve read about this show being heralded as a cinematic masterpiece; how the \u201ccinematography\u201d is incredible. Fucking please. Apparently all you need to do to be a cinematic masterpiece is use low color tones and wide screen. \\n\\n\r\n19) Teacher's the killer huh. Incredible. During that scene in the car where all his candy fell out of the dashboard I thought to myself 'no writer with any self-decency could possibly make him the killer after this scene, this has to be a fake.' Holy shit was I wrong. There were really only two ways this could have gone down 1) the teacher is the killer or 2) some random character gets introduced later as the killer, both if which are fucking awful. Author-kun dug himself in a hole day 1. I actually think, bare with me here, that the reveal was supposed to be a twist - but since it was so stupidly obvious (Satoru even says this in episode 10) it makes everything up to this point feel kind of pointless. If it wasn't supposed to be a twist then why hide it for so long? The only reason this is so awful is because the story has had such a strong focus on the 'whodunit' where it fails spectacularly. What kind of mystery presents a single suspect? The show should have never tried to be a mystery and instead focused on being a thriller. \\n\\n\r\n20) I was going to keep updating this as airing. After watching the finale, there were so many points coming up that I just fucking stopped caring. I'm tired of thinking about this shit. 19 points is good enough.\\n",

This might be one of the most overhyped anime after SAO. \r\nMinor spoilers ahead.\r\nArt is good i guess. It's not outstanding or absolutely disgusting. It's just what most anime looks like. And i didn't pay much attention to the music, but it was pretty enjoyable.\r\nI actually enjoyed the first 4-5 episodes. I thought it was gonna be something new and good. It was nice, but i was severely disappointed in the end. Main driving thing that is his powersare barely explained and barely touched. No one knows how does it work or how did he gain it. It's just there as a convenient plot device. The main antagonist is completely revealed at the start and they spend the rest of entire show trying to convince you that he's not the villain. Only to end in a rushed ending that leaves many things half assed.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are barely introduced, it focuses on 2 characters so much that it's not even funny, sure we get a glimpse of other characters backgrounds here and there but it doesn't clear up anything. And they just leave one of those 2 characters they were focusing on after episode 8 or so only to show up at the end with someone else's kid. (it's like 5cm per second all over again)\\n\\n\r\nOverall i give 4/10 for Boku Cucke. I would've given it 7 or 8 if it was not for the ending.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "\"Insert random quote here.\" - Character #01\r\nThat's how you begin a review, right? I've never been much of a reviewer, in fact you could say that this is my first review. I don't even know how to write a review. So why am I reviewing this show? I mean, there is obviously going to be an abundance of reviews, so this will most likely get lost among all the simple, spur of the moment 10/10 or 1/10 reviews that lack any real form or structure.\r\nSimply put; something resonated with me, something so profound and deep, that it shook the very fibers of my being, andso I had to share my thoughts on this so called 'masterpiece'. \\n\\n\r\nWait... did I just say masterpiece? More like disasterpiece.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe premise of Boku dake ga Inai Machi (ERASED) is simple. A struggling 29 year old mangaka (or manga artist for those not fluent in the Japanese language) has the special (and unexplained) power to turn back time (also known as 'Revival'), the catch is that this power only activates when tragedy strikes, and only takes him back a few minutes before the tragic event happens. However, tragedy strikes closer to home for our protagonist, and he finds himself whisked off on a magical journey, 18 years into the past. Our hero, now in the body of his child self, finds himself caught up in a series of child-murders, including one classmate, that somehow links the tragedy that transpired in the future (or present day or whatever (time travel is confusing)), and will try to save these victims in order to change his future (or his present time?).\\n\\n\r\n(This show has been compared to Steins;Gate more than once, but those comparisons are unjustified. ERASED may have its time travel elements, but so do other shows. If you're going into this show expecting Steins;Gate 2.0, stop now, as you will surely be disappointed)\\n\\n\r\nOn the surface, ERASED sounds good. In fact you could say it sounds pretty damn great; like some intense, mystery psycho-thriller, and the first few episodes prove to be great, but that's about as far as it gets. The reason being: plot holes. In the center of ERASED, we have our protagonist's Revival ability, an unexplained phenomenon, which sadly remains unexplained through out the series. Now I don't have a problem with this, as I prefer no explanation over one that would make absolutely no sense, but in ERASED's case, the way it uses Revival feels so cheap, that it removes any sense of urgency a mystery-thriller like this needs. Simply put, Revival appears to have no rules, and this here is the first and possibly biggest flaw this show has. My biggest gripe are the conveniences that come with this power, one point being that our protagonist is being chased, but before we know it, Revival kicks in. However, once he returns to the future (present), he's suddenly removed from the chase scene and has somehow evaded the pursuer(s). This is just one of many plot holes/conveniences this show has, but the point of this review isn't to showcase every flaw, but rather give you the opinion of some random guy on the Internet.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're hoping for a good mystery, like a lot of people were before entering this show, you're not going to find it. In fact as a mystery, ERASED lacks something very important: mystery. In fact the biggest mystery is making us wonder how this show managed to make it into the top 10, let alone top 5. At most times the show falls under two categories: too predictable; or too random. It seems like the show actually tries to cover up who the killer is, but before you know it, you've already guessed. This isn't necessarily a bad thing depending on how the show proceeded, as some viewers were saying that the show isn't about the 'who?', but the 'why?'. Why is the killer killing? After looking at this show from that angle, I was hoping for something more exciting, but what we basically get is that the killer kills 'cause he can, or in other words, he's evil 'cause he's evil and that's just who he is.\\n\\n\r\nThe whole idea of the protagonist reliving his childhood, but still maintaining his adult memories feels refreshing, and the way they handle it, for the most part, is done well. There have been some mixed opinions though, especially where romance is involved. Our protagonist is 29, but he's in the body of a 10-year-old, so is it wrong for him to be (what we can assume) interested in 10-year-old girls? I suppose that's something for the viewer to decide on their own. Speaking of romance, it's kept to a minimum, and no actual romance exists outside of a simple crush, so you don't have to worry about this show turning into some romantic comedy involving a 29-year-old man trapped in the body of 10 year old, attempting to get freaky with 10-year-old girls.\\n\\n\r\nAt its core ERASED is suspenseful and does indeed have its moments of greatness, albeit few, which really fill you with some hope that this show actually knows what it's doing. The cliffhangers start of good and have you anticipating what's going to come next, but they 're used so often and each one feels more over-the-top than the last, that they start to feel cheap. There are a couple of emotional moments, too, which actually feel quite natural and are probably the best moments in the entire show. One strong point this show suffers from, which could be linked to plot holes and conveniences, is logic. A lot of stuff just doesn't make sense, and this show does nothing to explain it. Some people like to argue that it's not important how certain things work/happen as they're not the 'focus' of the show, but it doesn't matter if they're the focus or not. Whether they're a main point of the story or not is irrelevant, they're still a part of the story and should be treated as such. I will refrain from discussing it further, as it will be hard to avoid entering the realm of spoilers if I proceed.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the story (though a good idea) ends up feeling somewhat lacklustre with its delivery due to bad direction and writing, some characters get too much, unneeded, focus, while others get little-to-no development and cheap backstories which don't add much to the story, but rather make you wonder why they felt the need to explain certain details. The show really starts to feel rushed later on, and eventually near the end, starts to feel like an inconsistent mess.\\n\\n\r\nERASED has a small, and somewhat varying cast of characters, but they get so little development over the course of the 12 episodes, that half could be either be combined or be replaced with some kind of inner monologue, and the show would still feel the same. \\n\\n\r\nWe have Satoru, our protagonist; a detached 29-year-old who lacks any of kind of personality outside of wanting to be a 'hero'.\\n\r\nHis development is minimum, and feels unnatural in that he acts according to the story; making unreasonable and sometimes illogical decisions, acting like a 10 year old more than the other actual 10 year old characters, and thinking that he can do everything by himself regardless of his limitations as a 10 year old.\\n\\n\r\nWe have Kayo, the main heroine of the story and victim #01; an abused child, with no friends, and fellow classmate of our protagonist.\\n\r\nShe is probably the most developed character in the show, starting off as a quiet and somewhat depressing child, who slowly starts to open up and learns what it means to have friends. At first her character feels like nothing but a shell used for forced sympathy, but as the story progresses, she becomes the center of what is one of the only good, and possibly best moments, in which we see some actual development happen in this show.\\n\\n\r\nI could talk about other characters, but most are either forgettable, or don't add enough to the story to earn a mention.\\n\\n\r\nERASED's art is pretty standard, but done very well. It's not the best art out there, but it's also not the worst, and I feel it compliments the story well. There are parts where the art looks exceptional, and there are parts where it looks pretty basic. The scenery looks consistent throughout, and is rather nice a lot of the time. The atmosphere gives of a dark and mysterious feel at times, which is good for what is supposed to be a mystery. The character designs are rather simple, but they work to their advantage.\\n\\n\r\nThere isn't really anything to complain about, there may be parts where it doesn't look as good as others, but nothing so bad, it distracts you from the anime itself.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is possibly ERASED's strongest point. It's eerie, it's dark, it's mysterious and it takes a minimal approach with its OST, where having less is sometimes better. It's a great compliment to the anime; it adds to the overall atmosphere of each scene, and doesn't stand out where it doesn't need to. The voice acting is also good as far as I can tell. The voices suit the characters well, you can feel the emotions whether they're joy, pain, or anger, it's just a shame that the characters themselves really lack any personality. I rarely listen to OPs or EDs as I find they don't add anything to the show, so I can't comment on their quality.\\n\\n\r\nWhat starts off as a gripping and thrilling experience, soon turns to headache after headache; with a lack of explanations; lack of development; plot holes; too many conveniences; and a somewhat rushed plot. In the end, it became another forgettable experience. Whether you should watch it or not, is up to you.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want some cheap thrills, and don't like to think too much, then this show may be for you. It's not a terrible show, it definitely has its moments, but overall, it's nothing that special either. If you're hoping to find a successor to Steins;Gate, just watch Steins;Gate again.",

            "content": "Erased: A Review\r\n(This is my first review, so cut me a bit of slack. Positive criticism is both welcomed and encouraged).\r\nHaving finished watching Erased, my initial emotion was one of confusion. Having left the series alone for a few days to form concrete opinions about the show, this feeling of confusion did not go away, but served as the fundamentals of a couple of issues which I will explore in more detail later on.\r\nAs for the show itself, it starts with an interesting enough premise. The main character Satoru Fujinuma is a twenty-something year old man who works as a courier for a pizza shopin between being a manga artist; hoping to one day make it as a popular manga artist. Or at least I think he does; when he isn\u2019t being hopelessly apathetic about pretty much everything. What makes Erased stand out is Satoru\u2019s power, which he dubs \u2018Revival\u2019. Basically, he can go back in time by a few minutes in order to stop a tragic event from happening. So, all is well, until he becomes the suspect for his mother\u2019s murder and is then promptly thrown 18 years into the past.\\n\\n\r\nIt turns out that the individual who murdered his mother is the same person who 18 years ago was guilty of the abductions of several young girls. In a \u2018surprising\u2019 twist, it turns out the wrong person was arrested. Shock! Horror! Anyway, it turns out that Satoru was in the same class as one of the abducted, and thus the plot begins as the adult Satoru, trapped in his younger self\u2019s body, attempts to save his classmate Kayo Hinazuki.\\n\\n\r\nThe main bulk of the anime follows Satoru\u2019s attempts to save Kayo; which is fine. If Satoru knows about the crime, preventing is certainly one way to go about. As such, a large part of the show details Satoru\u2019s relationship with Kayo as he attempts to befriend her and help her. Which is fine, until they chuck in the fact that Kayo is being abused; which is the first issue I had with the show. There was no rhyme or reason for this particular plot line. In fact, it felt like a convenient plot point so that Satoru\u2019s reasons for saving her didn\u2019t seem completely contrived to the other characters; which had the unfortunate effect of making his reasoning seemed contrived to the viewer. Even when the reason behind the abuse is revealed, it sounded forced. Rather like the motive was tacked on to give it more legitimacy.\\n\\n\r\nSo what about Satoru and Kayo as both characters and the dynamic of their relationship? Honestly, neither character stood out for me. Satoru is far too apathetic (which is another way of saying he\u2019s a bit dull) and Kayo doesn\u2019t sound like a ten year old. Some of her soundbites sound just too mature to be coming from the mouth of a little girl. Not to mention in a show where little girls are being abducted, the fact that the main character is still an adult did create a jarring sensation for me, especially in scenes where he is lusting after her. Thrown into this is another character, Kenya, who is far too smart for his age. It seemed very obvious at times that these young children were being written by adults. It probably explains the fascination with Satoru\u2019s character. After all, who doesn\u2019t wish that they could relive they childhood while having that wisdom of an adult mind? Except, Satoru doesn\u2019t always act intelligently or wisely, and this is apparent in the latter half of the series, and already occurs within the first couple of episodes when he runs away from the crime he didn\u2019t commit, thus making himself the prime suspect. There\u2019s also a co-worker who helps him, yet he doesn\u2019t entertain the idea that the police are following her without her knowledge in order to get to him, and guess what. Yeah, he gets caught. Bloody idiot. \\n\\n\r\nBefore I discuss my biggest problem with the show, let me get this out of the way. I did not hate or dislike this series. I enjoyed the first half of the show. While Satoru and Kayo are individually not great characters, their relationship and interactions are entertaining enough, even if the paedophilic dynamic between the two does exist. There were also quite a few heart-warming scenes, including one at the end of episode 8 which tugs at the heartstrings. \\n\\n\r\nThe interactions between the two lead characters is helped both by a soundtrack which isn\u2019t memorable by itself, but compliments both the scene it\u2019s being used in and the colour and tone that is being relayed to the viewer, from the darker tones of the outside world to the warm colours of the inside of Satoru\u2019s house (for example) thus juxtaposing the inclusivity of the home with the loneliness of the outside world. There is also the contrast with the colours between Satoru\u2019s house and Kayo\u2019s house; the latter almost always seen through a darker palette of colour. The insinuation is clear. A lot of the show takes place during the winter, which also helps to create that juxtaposition between the warm atmosphere of the home and the cold atmosphere outside. All this works well.\\n\\n\r\nMy biggest problem with the show is with both its pacing at the plot. My feeling of confusion comes from these problems. You see, I was under the impression that the show was a mystery thriller, yet it spent the first several episodes developing this relationship between Kayo and Satoru, which is fine, but is neither thrilling nor mysterious. Not once does Satoru even use his knowledge of the future to second-guess the murderer\u2019s motives, instead believing that by saving Kayo, the murderer won\u2019t kill her and his mother won\u2019t be killed in his future. This is where Satoru\u2019s lack of intelligence comes to the fray. He doesn\u2019t even entertain the notion that the murderer may go elsewhere to kill. However, Satoru is unperturbed by this notion, and instead goes onto save the other girls near to him who also fall victim to this murderer. At this point, one has to question Satoru\u2019s motives. It doesn\u2019t seem like he\u2019s particularly bothered about finding his mother\u2019s killer. This transformation is bizarre as Satoru begins to resemble a white knight of justice. \\n\\n\r\nNot only that, but Satoru\u2019s intentions and motives don\u2019t make sense. He wishes to save his mother. It also transpires that Satoru feels guilt for not saving Kayo the first time round, despite not knowing who she was and having only seen her in a park the night she disappeared. How does one feel guilt over a person\u2019s disappearance when they did not even know said individual? Satoru\u2019s initial motives and his actions once he goes back in time don\u2019t tally up, creating a character that is difficult to understand because he himself makes little sense.\\n\\n\r\nSo, having spent the first eight or nine episodes contriving to save the three people close to him, guess what happens next. Considering that this is a 12 episode series, you can imagine. They rush the ending. The writers spent so much time building up the relationship between Satoru and Kayo, as well as the other characters, that in the end they run out of time. The supposed mystery that was at the heart of this series (who is the serial abductor and murderer?) is tacked on in the end in the most convenient of ways. The murderer tells the main character. The murderer is thrown into the plot in order to answer the question of who was behind the abductions. Not thrown in in the sense that the murderer is someone out of the blue, but that they are the most obvious candidate. The show tries to make them seem mysterious by showing the eyes under the hat in order make them more menacing. All this does though, is show just make the murderer's identity that much more obvious. Not to mention that the murderer\u2019s motives are odd, their actions even odder (apparently, having their main targets protected is sufficient reason for them not to carry out anymore abductions in the town) and the reveal just plain anti-climactic. A mystery/thriller lives and dies by its villains. A good villain can elevate a show, while a bad one tends more often than not to drag it down into the gutter. This villain isn\u2019t bad, just nonsensical. Not to mention the final showdown with the murderer is both horribly clich\u00e9d and yet more nonsensical as Satoru attempts to understand the murderer.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the time-travel, the principle plot point which allows the plot to happen and such has an importance within the narrative, isn\u2019t fully explained. There are a few questions to ask about, chief among which is how he travels back 18 years when on every other occasion, it only reset time by a few minutes. Honestly, I don\u2019t mind it. I\u2019d rather the writers not explain it then attempt to give it a reason, and then thoroughly screw up that reason. Plus the time travel doesn\u2019t have a massive impact on the story, other than as a tool by which to start turning the wheels of the story. Even if there is a level of Deus Ex Machina halfway through the series to keep the plot going.\\n\\n\r\nErased was an odd anime to review. If only because what the producers marketed the show to be (a mystery/thriller with elements of time travel) and my experience of the show did not tally with each other. The mystery/ thriller element, the fact that the main driving engine of the show was Satoru stopping his mother being murdered by preventing the death of his classmate in the past and also trying to find the murderer doesn\u2019t manifest itself. One of the most important elements of the show, the murderer, turns out to not even matter, which is a damning indictment of the failing of the mystery elements of the show, and contributed this odd feeling that I had. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I enjoyed the first half of the show. It was entertaining fare. It\u2019s just that as a mystery/thriller anime, it didn\u2019t work. Yet, because it was straitjacketed by its own genre, the finale left me wholly unsatisfied, and a show with an interesting premise which started well enough quickly devolve into an unadulterated mess later on.\\n",

            "content": "Boku dake ga Inai Machi - the hit of 2016, the most popular anime of the winter season. At the time of writing this review it's 39th on the top anime list and 69th on the popularity one. It has been praised to the heavens by many, but also called overrated by some. So how good is it actually? The answer is: a mix of both.\r\nYou might dislike the show if:\r\n- you are a mystery anime veteran, or an anime veteran as a whole.\r\n- you care more about the destination than the journey itself.\r\n- you have to have a rational explanation for absolutely anything.\r\nYou mightlike the show if:\\n\r\n- you are new to the mystery genre.\\n\r\n- you like well made drama or a thriller.\\n\r\n- you're looking for an anime that looks and sounds great.\\n\r\n- you want to watch a show in one sitting.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nBoku dake Inai Machi starts great, and the first half of the show is really enjoyable. There is a big problem though. It's a mystery anime, but the huge reveal is predictable. However, if you don't look at it as such, and instead consider it a thriller, with only a slight taste of a mystery and a bit of drama, it becomes better. That's how I reccomend you go into it. Because if someone would go into it expecting their mind to be blown away, they would be disappointed. If this is your very first experience with anything mystery-like though, forget everything. You might just find it difficult to figure out the truth.\\n\r\nThe drama parts of this show (especially Kayo's story), the main characters struggles and the killer's motives and actions are actually quite interesting. The problem is that some of those things are not expanded enough. The show's length doesn't allow it. Not only does the main character's power never get explained, or even adressed for more  than 20 minutes total, but the ending seems very rushed and forced down the viewers throat. In the end the story felt a bit disappointing, but was good enough to keep me going.\\n\\n\r\nArt, Animation and Sound: 10\\n\r\nNow this is where the show shines the brightest. This anime looks and sounds fantastic. The animation is fluid and a decent amount of scenes can be stuck in your mind for a while, because of the brilliant coordination of all elements. If you want any proof i recommend a video called \"What's in a Scene? - ERASED's Genius Park Scene (from Ep. 2)\" on Youtube (spoilers for the first and a bit of the second episode. Duh).  It showcases everything much better than I can. I'll just say that I was blown away by the amount of symbolism this anime passes onto the viewer through the colours, music and other subtle things. Truly amazing work. I also want to mention the opening and the ending. Both of them really fit the series, and are just a pleasure to listen and look at.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7\\n\r\nI know this show was not supposed to be extremely focused on characters  but this is really unacceptable. Not only is there not many characters to  serve as suspects, but they are not developed enough . Even the main character is underdeveloped. And it hurts because the cast at the first glance looked very good. There are exceptions to this however: Sachiko, the main character's mom, and the savior of the series: Kayo Hinazuki. Not only is her arc very emotional and intriguing, but her character is very well written and as you slowly uncover more about her you just can't help but to enjoy every scene she appears in. As i mentioned the murderer is also quite interesting, but his motives are ultimately not talked about as much as they should be. What i do have to praise this anime for however, is how it presents children and their problems. Their reactions feel genuine, and not a single character felt annoying, which I'm sure was hard to pull off.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nEven with all the bad things, I really enjoyed it. It had a captivating story, even if it got a bit worse towards the end, a fantastic character in Kayo, and some beautiful scenes along the way. The characters even if underdeveloped at least didn't ruin the show, which could happen considering they were children. Maybe I enjoyed it a bit more than I should, because i remembered my own elementary school experiences. I also really, and i mean REALLY enjoyed Kayo's character.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nDoes it deserve the amount of praise it gets? Not really, it's good but not that good. Does it deserve the hate it's getting? Hell no! I've seen 5's and even 3's for this show. It had a lot going for it and you can't just give this low of a score not acknowledging what it has to offer. It's also a great introduction to mystery anime for the new viewers. However i do have to agree that it doesn't deserve a spot this high on the top anime list. It should definetely be lower. I personally enjoyed it enought to give it an 8, although it could easily had been a 7. Anything above that is seriously a stretch. \\n\\n\r\nIf after watching this show you have a burning desire for more mystery anime i recommend Death Note of course, as it's probably the best one, Hyouka, which is  a bit more lighthearted and Death Parade, which is a bit more psychological.",

            "content": "English:\r\nI decided to do a little analysis about Boku Dake Ga Inai Machi / Erased, since it is a work considered good by a good part of the people who see animes, but it is a work that lacks quality, so I would like to explain the reasons for being a work bad.\r\nI will talk about the following aspects of the work: Script, characters and other technical aspects (like direction and animation), focusing mainly on the first two aspects.\r\nScreenplay: One of the greatest weaknesses of the work, the script of the work is full of clear conveniences, I will mention some here: Soon in the1st episode Satoru comes back from work and enters one of the rooms, sees his mother dead, goes to her and turns to her, ends up getting her hand dirty with blood, scaring herself and going backwards, thus leaving the room, and conveniently, the moment he leaves the room, a neighbor of his appears in the door (The door was closed, the neighbor basically opened the door. door and almost entered without even knocking on the door or calling before), she sees him with blood on his hands and starts to scream, even if it could be something that was not blood or he could have hurt himself, after that appears the police using the teleport, I consider this an idiotic convenience, since there were several ways to circumvent this convenience. In episode 5, when Satoru runs away from his manager's house and ends up jumping a wall and falling in the middle of the road, a friend of his appears from the middle of nowhere, who ends up helping him to flee. In episode 7 they basically decide to leave Kayo in a safe place, conveniently this place was the base of the killer, in that same episode Satoru was going to try to take Hinazuki's mother out of a ladder, magically a friend of his appears behind him without making any noise and prevents it from doing so [5], to avoid major problems. Now I am going to speak very quickly about the time travel, the work itself does not take advantage of the trip in time, there is no explanation for it to occur only with the protagonist or any explanation of why it occurs in only a few specific cases. The mystery is extremely badly made and simple, having the very direction making it easy to find out who was to blame. Another problem of the work is the bad distribution of the episodes, it focuses on practically 7 episodes to save Hinazuki, while there are only two more episodes to save the 2 others (random mine without any development and the boy that looked like a guria), besides that the end was rush.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Another weakness of the play, several characters in the play are completely one-dimensional and useless, we have a 29-year-old protagonist in a child's body, but his maturity is so great that sometimes he needs other children to prevent him from do shit. These children are also another problem in the play, all children are over ripe for age, as I said before, some being as mature as the protagonist. Some characters have a bit of charisma, but this is restricted to almost only the protagonist and Kayo, the rest being various disposable characters and poorly used. The work features characters who are initially shown as secondary, but further on in the work they gain a sudden prominence, as Airi, who passes it from \"Mina that worked with the protagonist\" to \"Mina that helped the protagonist\" and then to \" Possible romantic couple of the protagonist \".\\n\\n\r\nDirection: The direction of the work is extreme zada, putting for example stupid things, like putting red eyes in personages considered bad (Or that will do something evil), the work also ends up leaving something very clear, for example, to use a position of the camera that always goes to show the \"villain\" from the bottom up, or he get faces that make it very clear that he is the villain.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: There is not much to talk about here, the work does not require fluent animation or the like, I do not remember any deformation in the character design, so the work does not present major problems here.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, I do not have much more to talk about (I do not have much time to do the analysis), so my little analysis is ready, from her I conclude that Boku Dake Ga Inai Machi is a work often overrated and that it lacks quality.\\n\\n\r\nPortugu\u00eas:\\n\\n\r\nAnalise Erased/Boku Dake Ga Inai Machi\\n\\n\r\nDecidi fazer uma pequena analise sobre Boku Dake Ga Inai Machi/Erased, j\u00e1 que \u00e9 uma obra considera boa por uma boa parte do publico otaku brasileiro (E de v\u00e1rios outros lugares do mundo), por\u00e9m \u00e9 uma obra que carece de qualidade, ent\u00e3o gostaria de explicar os motivos para ser uma obra ruim.\\n\\n\r\nVou falar sobre os seguintes aspectos da obra:Roteiro, personagens e outros aspectos t\u00e9cnicos (Como dire\u00e7\u00e3o e anima\u00e7\u00e3o), focando principalmente nos dois primeiros aspectos. \\n\\n\r\nRoteiro: Um dos maiores pontos fracos da obra, o roteiro da obra \u00e9 lotado de conveni\u00eancias claras, vou citar algumas aqui: Logo no 1\u00b0 epis\u00f3dio Satoru volta do trabalho e entra em um dos c\u00f4modos, v\u00ea a m\u00e3e dele morta, vai at\u00e9 ela e a vira, acaba sujando a m\u00e3o de sangue, se assustando e indo para tr\u00e1s, saindo assim do comodo, e convenientemente no momento em que ele sai do comodo aparece uma vizinha dele na porta (A porta estava fechada, a vizinha basicamente abriu a porta e quase entrou sem nem sequer bater na porta ou chamar antes), ela v\u00ea ele com sangue nas m\u00e3os e come\u00e7a a gritar , mesmo que pudesse ser algo que n\u00e3o fosse sangue ou ele pudesse ter se machucado, ap\u00f3s isso aparece a policia utilizando o teletransporte, considero essa uma conveni\u00eancia idiota, j\u00e1 que haviam varias formas de contornar essa conveni\u00eancia. Agora vou falar outras que me lembro do resto da s\u00e9rie: No epis\u00f3dio 5, quando o Satoru foge da casa do gerente dele e acaba pulando um muro e caindo no meio da estrada, aparece do meio do nada uma amiga dele, que acaba ajudando ele a fugir. No epis\u00f3dio 7 eles basicamente decidem deixar a Kayo em um lugar seguro, convenientemente esse lugar era a base do assassino, nesse mesmo epis\u00f3dio o Satoru ia tentar derrubar a m\u00e3e da Hinazuki de uma escada, magicamente um amigo dele aparece atr\u00e1s dele sem fazer qualquer barulho e o impede disso [5], para evitar problemas maiores. Agora vou falar bem rapidamente sobre a viagem no tempo, a obra em si n\u00e3o aproveita nem um pouco a viagem no tempo, n\u00e3o h\u00e1 qualquer explica\u00e7\u00e3o para que ela ocorra apenas com o protagonista ou qualquer explica\u00e7\u00e3o de porque ela ocorre em apenas alguns casos espec\u00edficos. O mist\u00e9rio \u00e9 extremamente mal feito e simples, tendo a pr\u00f3pria dire\u00e7\u00e3o facilitando a descobrir que era o culpado. Outro problema da obra \u00e9 a mal distribui\u00e7\u00e3o dos epis\u00f3dios, ele foca praticamente 7 epis\u00f3dios para salvar a Hinazuki, enquanto restam apenas mais 2 epis\u00f3dios para salvar os 2 outros (Mina aleat\u00f3ria sem qualquer desenvolvimento e o moleque que parecia uma guria), al\u00e9m de que o final ficou rushado.\\n\\n\r\nPersonagens: Um outro ponto fraco da obra, diversos personagens da obra s\u00e3o completamente unidimensionais e in\u00fateis, temos um protagonista de 29 anos em um corpo de uma crian\u00e7a, por\u00e9m a maturidade dele \u00e9 tanta que as vezes ele precisa de outras crian\u00e7as para impedirem ele de fazer merda. Essas crian\u00e7as tamb\u00e9m s\u00e3o outro problema na obra, todas crian\u00e7as s\u00e3o maduras de mais para a idade, como eu disse antes, algumas sendo t\u00e3o maduras quanto o protagonista. Alguns personagens possuem um pouco de carisma, mas isso est\u00e1 restrito a quase que apenas o protagonista e a Kayo, sendo o resto v\u00e1rios personagens descart\u00e1veis e mal aproveitados. A obra apresenta personagens que inicialmente s\u00e3o mostrados como secund\u00e1rios, por\u00e9m mais al\u00e9m na obra acabam ganhando um destaque s\u00fabito, como a Airi, que a passa de \"Mina que trabalhava com o protagonista\" para \"Mina que ajudou o protagonista\" e depois para \"Poss\u00edvel par rom\u00e2ntico do protagonista\".\\n\\n\r\nDire\u00e7\u00e3o: A dire\u00e7\u00e3o da obra \u00e9 extremante zoada, botando por exemplo coisas idiotas, como botando olhos vermelhos em personagens considerados maus (Ou que v\u00e3o fazer algo maldoso), a obra tamb\u00e9m acaba deixando umas coisas bem claras, por exemplo, usar uma posi\u00e7\u00e3o da c\u00e2mera em que sempre ira mostra o \"vil\u00e3o\" de baixo para cima, ou ele ficar com caras que deixam muito claro que ele \u00e9 o vil\u00e3o. \\n\\n\r\nAnima\u00e7\u00e3o: N\u00e3o h\u00e1 muito o que falar aqui, a obra n\u00e3o necessita de uma anima\u00e7\u00e3o com fluidez ou coisas do tipo, eu n\u00e3o me lembro de nenhuma deforma\u00e7\u00e3o no character design, ent\u00e3o a obra n\u00e3o apresenta grandes problemas aqui.\\n\\n\r\nOk, n\u00e3o tenho mais muita coisa pra falar (Tamb\u00e9m n\u00e3o estou com tanto tempo para fazer a analise), ent\u00e3o a minha pequena analise est\u00e1 pronta, a partir dela concluo que Boku Dake Ga Inai Machi (Ou Erased) \u00e9 uma obra muitas vezes superestimada e que carece de qualidade.

            "content": "TL;DR at the bottom\r\nBoku dake ga Inai Machi is a pretty outstanding anime in terms of the originality of the plot and the progression of the story. It's not a lazy anime, so nor should its viewers be. This series progresses in a very realistic and measured manner. despite some minor flaws, all in all, it boasts a maturity and clarity that few animes in recent seasons have been able to deliver. \r\nStory: 10/10 (for what it is) \r\nErased is not a series that unfolds on a cosmic level, the reach of the protagonists powers is small and thus imbues a sense of reality andcare that many animes don't nowadays. I'll make this short; if you're almost exclusively a fan of cheap panty shots, sloppily pieced together plots, and campy harems, you probably will not like this, most likely due to a lack of understanding. If you're not a fan of sentimentality, you probably will like it for its art and clarity, but probably won't be giving this a 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nThis story isn't clever beyond belief, but it's intricate and well-paced. The MC has an ability to time travel, but solely altruistically, he cannot change his life, but rather his abilities allow him the privilege (or burden) to save the lives of others, or to stop evil befalling onto innocent people. He uses this power to go back in time to stop an event that defined his childhood, and the childhoods of his classmates at the time. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is sweet, simple and well executed. It's not saccharine in its development, but I must say, though it may not be exactly what the viewer wanted or expected, the ending is satisfying. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10 \\n\r\nThe art style is simple, elegant and DETAILED! even in scenes when there is only dialogue, there is a continuous movement! The background scenes have life in them. they aren't just lazy 2D placeholders, the design elements in this series are almost flawless, watching anything after this will open your eyes to the countless corners that are cut to pump out a lot of the banal animes you see now. Erased is a benchmark for high production value. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\r\nThe characters are fleshed out and believable, our MC goes through considerable change during the series, and by episode 12 his outlook on life has taken a total 180 (in the most positive sense) \\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: if you want something that is captivating in every sense, watch this anime! It's fun, sweet, tear wrenching and clever in a way that doesn't ask much of the viewer, all it begs of you is that you sit back and watch the story unfold. This is a definite 10/10 that'll leave you searching for something to fill the hole it'll leave once it's done.",

            "content": "I went into ERASED with the suspicion that it became popular despite mearly appearing to be good without actually presenting any interesting or challenging plot threads or ideas. I was not disappointed. I watched this show because I was bored. I was in the mood for something that could hold my attention for a few hours without making think too hard. This was perfect for the dreary mood I was in. It did manage to hold my interest long enough for me to watch all 12 episodes. It wasn't until the next day when I started thinking about the show that I realized it wasreally stupid. I mean, the premise is interesting, the art looks good, and the direction is solid(sometimes), but there are several plot holes, lots of dumb garbage, and several baffling decisions made in this show.\\n\\n\r\nGARBAGE #1: The kids rarely talk or behave like kids, and when they DO talk like real kids, it's really off-putting, because it becomes more obvious that they don't really talk like kids.\\n\\n\r\nGARBAGE #2: They show the killer's body, frame, and part of his FACE, in EPISODE ONE. It's treated like it's supposed to be a mystery to the viewer who the killer is, but there's only one character with that frame and body type in the show who isn't already in jail, and when he appears in episode two, he enters the shot from the shadows. This isn't \"epic foreshadowing\". This is pandering.\\n\\n\r\nGARBAGE #3: A character by the name Kayo (the girl in the poster) is the victim of her mother's abuse. Child abuse is not only misrepresented in this show, but it also is NOT one of the shows main themes, even though the show dedicates a lot of time to it. There's an ugly, red filter onscreen every time the mother shows up, and every evil character has red eyes during intense scenes. Duh, they're bad. We get it. Also, Kayo doesn't have a very satisfying conclusion to her arc. Her evil underdeveloped mother gets a longer, undeserved, more detailed conclusion. \\n\\n\r\nGARBAGE #4: The main character has time travel powers. Why? I don't know. How do they work? I don't know. Can he control it? Yes, and no. Also, there's a little blue butterfly that appears occasionally. GET IT?? CAUSE BUTTERFLY EFFECT??? OH MY GOD THE WRITERS PLAYED \"LIFE IS STRANGE\", DIDN'T THEY? That game was ok I guess but not really.\\n\\n\r\nGARBAGE #5: The teacher says he knows for a fact that Kayo's mom is beating her, but he could never prove it because \"her mother is really good at hiding the marks\". WHAT. The main character figured it out because he saw a clearly exposed bruise on her leg! And the main character's weirdly mature friend figured it out the same way! DUUUUUMB\\n\\n\r\nGARBAGE #6: WARNING: SPOILERS FOR A GARBAGE SHOW: The main character nearly drowns in episode 10 and ends up in a coma. The reason? The killer tricked him into wearing a trick seatbelt that won't unbuckle. The killer drives the car into a lake and jumps out, leaving what's-his-nuts to die. He could easily loosen the strap and slide out underneath it, considering he was in his small kid body at the time, but nope. I guess the writers don't know how seatbelts work. Oh, and they don't show how he got out. Ugh.\\n\\n\r\nGARBAGE #7: During the final showdown between a wheelchair-ridden time travel boy and his psychotic but handsome ex-teacher, (SPOILE--DUH IT WAS THE TEACHER) they have a weird discussion about symbolic threads of a spider's web that are only brought up in this episode, time travel boy pretends to kill himself, teacher laughs, and this is supposed to be a satisfying conclusion, even though the entire episode feels very seperate from the rest of the show. But that's not the dumbest part...ok, listen to this. These two are on the ROOF of a HOSPITAL. Ok? There is a FENCE around the ROOF of this HOSPITAL. Still with me? Ok, good. There is a GATE in this FENCE around the ROOF of a HOSPITAL. This actual GATE goes nowhere, and is just wide enough for a wheelchair to fit through. The MAIN CHARACTER IS IN A WHEELCHAIR. The only reason this suicide gate is there is because the writer needed it to be there so that his idea for an \"epic conclusion\" could happen. The ENTIRE basis of this climax HINGES on something that makes ZERO SENSE. \\n\\n\r\nThe only reason I'm giving this a 3 instead of a 1 or a 2 is because I gave Asterisk War a 1, and I gave Sword Art Online a 2. I want it to be clear that ERASED is bad, but not quite as bad as those other abominations. If I knew before hand that all three of these shows were made by the same studio, I would have avoided ERASED like the plague. It doesn't deserve to be popular, and I just wanted to vent this because venting is fun. Now, I'm off to go tear Asterisk War a new one. Goodnight.",

The advertisement was stunning and I knew I had to check this series out. I was instantly star-struck, and watched every episode, waiting for the next one to come out. I even went as far as to rewatch episodes over and over. The story was captivating, each episode brought new clues towards a mystery, and new emotions. Along with that, the characters were developed brilliantly. It's one of my all-time favorite series. All the sound work wasincredible as well. The opening song, catchy, and the voice acting immaculate. \\n\\n\r\n         It's hard for me to pick out any negatives for this series, so I'll just say that everyone has their own taste and I'm sure you'll find a few things you didn't enjoy! \\n\\n\r\n         Overall, I loved this series. I find myself wondering how many lives I could impact if I had an opportunity like Satoru. It's a must watch for anyone who likes mystery/thriller style anime. The story will pull you in, and really make you think about life, and how blessed you may be. \\n\\n\r\nI dashing 10/10 ---- \\n\\n",

            "content": "I think it's safe to say at this point that the hype train for this show is dead. I still see it in numerous favorite sections, but I can't find any more Kayo themed profiles or people screaming on the forums that it was AOTY. What surprises me, though, is how Boku Dake ga Inai Machi was able to hold it's place in the rankings. This has plenty of negative feedback as well as plenty positive, but to me, I didn't really see it as a topic for discussion in the first place. It was an average anime that just happened to be produced welland for this reason gained explosive popularity.\\n\\n\r\nFor me, the first problem with Boku Dake ga Inai Machi, as many others have already stated, is that it's listed under the mystery genre, when it's quite honestly obvious who the killer is right from the start if you payed enough attention. It's made even more evident when there really isn't any other suspects for who the killer could be. However, I don't believe that to have been the main focal point of the story from the start. What really was meant to captivate the viewer was the exhilarating twists and turns of the plot, and anticipating what could happen next. Even this ended up being more of a weakness than a strength though. Not because these routes were uninteresting, but because they weren't explored enough. Despite them being entertaining nevertheless, I believe it set the bar too high, and during the episodes I felt myself dissatisfied, possibly even BORED, until the cliffhanger kicked in, and that ending song... OH MAN DAT ENDING SONG. Without getting too off topic, the story is weak in most aspects though not quite pathetic, and it definitely emitted some strongly positive vibes in those first couple episodes.Those same positive vibes, however, are what made it's fall in the second half even harder.\\n\\n\r\nA-1 pictures are one of the more well known anime studios, because of the massive amount of shows they put out, and because of how most of them are terrible. One of the few things that aren't ranted on about usually is their animation style. Sword Art Online would be a great example of what their animation can do when the directors and staff for the episode are just right. Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso may or may not have the most beautiful art style out of any anime ever. Even anime from the same season (Hai to Gensou no Grimgar) was gifted with a beautiful landscape and character design. Boku Dake ga Inai Machi... wasn't as lucky. What I find strange is the craze over 'OMG GUYSH CAN YOU BELIVE THE SCREEN NARROWS WEHN SATORU IS KID NO WAYAY'. Uh, that really doesn't change anything besides making it easier to animate... the character design, also, is a major turn off. It may have improved from the original manga, at least, but it's still nowhere near impressive. Maybe there really is some deeper meaning to the animation, or maybe it is legitimately above average, and effort was put into it. But, I didn't see it with the first glance, and there really isn't any point if you can't.\\n\\n\r\nI would consider myself a Yuki Kajiura fanboy. I'd go as far as to watch an anime I wasn't even relatively interested in just to hear her composing skills at work. However, even I have to admit that she isn't perfect. For the last couple years I feel her talent had been on decline because of how similar everything sounds. No matter how much you like a song, you WILL get tired of it eventually. So, even though I love her work more than my own life... I can't usually give it more than a 9/10. Keyword in that sentence being USUALLY. For every SAO and Fate/Zero there will always be a Madoka and a Boku Dake ga Inai Machi. Wow, that feels weirder than I thought putting Boku Dake in that sentence. But it is true. Boku Dake ga Inai Machi is her best work in a long time, with the chiming sounds and soft melodies giving Boku Dake ga Inai Machi the boost it needed to make it a mystery story. However, what shone even brighter than the soundtrack were the opening and ending themes. The opening theme is a phenomenal buildup to the show with it's odd sound effects and unique voice acting. The ending, almost as to 1-up it, does the same thing but twice as well, becoming one of my all time favorite ending themes. The voice acting is great as expected from renowned seiyuu. On the topic of seiyuu, Satoru's seiyuu is an interesting case. He was hired specifically for his inexperience and yet sounds totally experienced. I'm neutral as to whether this is a good or bad thing.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Satoru: what is UP with him anyway? What was the point of making him how he is? He's like a failed attempt to be both relatable and cool. I can't really pinpoint anything interesting about him whatsoever, design, personality-wise or through any of his actions and interactions. Hinazuki is just a kuudere that gets the development a kuudere normally does. Nothing really specially, but at least she's not a harem character. There is one thing that sets her apart though: that gorgeous red coat. The contrast of it on the snow she's repeatedly portrayed on is eye candy, bringing out the best visuals the show has to offer. None of the side characters really stand out, but there are a couple notable ones like One Punch Girl (Manager deserved it) and Super Mom. The rest are just there to advance the plot, my favorites being Generic Abusive Mom and Headphones kid, that do almost literally nothing but people like them anyway. \\n\\n\r\nBoku Dake ga Inai Machi gave signs of being a terrible anime straight from the start, but it also let out extremely positive vibes. It's a great showcase of how anime can take different paths and end up being terrible or fantastic. I don't think Boku dake ga Inai Machi is as bad as I put it out to be, and a portion of the flaws mentioned are hard to pick out unless you pay serious attention. It's a mediocre show but an enjoyable one nevertheless.",

On top of that the series put up a really good murder mystery setting (even if one knows the true culprit from episode 1-2 if you can put together a little logic thinking) but anyways the characters sure don't because they don't see whatthe viewer sees and most of them are 8 years old. \\n\r\nWithout spoiling too much I have to say that the conclusion of who the kidnapper was was executed really well but what happened after the reveal, well lets say I hope for future shows to have:\\n\\n\r\nA) more guts to take a more serious turn of events and don't force a happy ending down my throat\\n\\n\r\nor B) Don't make an abrupt cut at the end like \"and then it was fine, lol\"\\n\\n\r\nIf you ignore the ending the show was great, with it it was still quite good",

            "content": "Have you ever wanted to change something in your life?  Has there ever been a time where you thought that it would've been better to 'redo' that part of your life just to see if it could come out better?  For many, such a regret comes along in their life to the extent that just thinking about it brings regret.  But if you were to have that chance, would you do it?  Boku Dake, Erased, one of if not THE most hyped anime of the Winter 2015 season, and a show that is honestly...not what I was expecting in terms ofquality.\\n\\n\r\nStory: Satoru is a 29 year old man who man who aspires to be a mangaka.  Being forced to work at a dead end pizza delivery boy as a means to survive in the world, his life is filled with the act of fixing mistakes.  With a past involving the regret of saying a girl named Kayo in his elementary/primary school days where she was murdered, causing him to become rather lame in motivation in life and more or less limbers on with what goes on, pushing away what little connections to people and life that he has left.  With his ability of 'Revival', he has the ability to go back in time a certain duration of time (usually around 2-3 minutes), and fix whatever goes wrong in his immediate area to prevent something terrible from happening.  It is on one faithful night with the murder of his mother that he finds himself back in time to his 6th grade self, back to the faithful period of time that his classmate was brutally murdered.  \\n\\n\r\nAs a mystery anime with an overarching story, Boku Dake heavily implants itself into the murder mystery and 'find the killer' plot that it very clearly puts itself in.  The main plot of the story is for Satoru to save Kayo from the threat of being murdered seeing as how he has come from the future and knows when she gets murdered.  The atmosphere of this show is very cinematic in its presentation and has this dull yet calm feeling to it that really evokes a feeling of involvement, as every episode is done in a way that makes you want to continue watching forward, and because it sucks you into it, the show leaves you always wanting more.  \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that this show does well on is its quality of character development.  Because the series focuses so heavily on Satoru and his crusade to rescue Kayo from sure death, we get a lot of time devoted to the change of his character from this rather unassuming and mopey character to one that really grows to be this warm and inviting person.  The growth is obvious, but gradual over the course of the show.  (It's actually really hard to write this to try and avoid spoilers, since mystery shows, specifically ones with one, overarching plot can have one detail said and the whole plot goes down the hole.)\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, Boku Dake isn't without its flaws.  When put on its own pedestal, this adaptation does a relatively good job at portraying the story and fitting the majority of the plot within the one cour timespace.  However, when comparing it to the manga, things get a little iffy.  While done as well as it could've been, the anime suffers from some minor plot holes here and there that are just a result of production not being able to fit everything in, through no fault of A-1.  (They tried and did really well.)  It's just that in terms of detail, the story is a lot more barebones and less detail than it could've been, since a lot of meatier or minute details to finalize certain points just weren't there.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall, while the transition from manga to anime made A-1 strain out a lot of details, both important and unimportant from the series overall, this adaptation, when taken standalone, does a very nice job with the Boku Dake story and does so by giving us the murder mystery and the wonderfully adorable character development that plagues this show like a disease.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Well crafted story\\n\r\n+  Great character development\\n\r\n-   Production caused a lot of story elements/details to be essentially absent  (Mostly due to time constraints)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Ah, yes, the characters.  The characters are another reason why this show is so highly regarded.  The show really focuses on the characters just as much if not a bit more than the actual story, and as such, are made in such a way that you can't help but not like.  \\n\\n\r\nOf course, first, we have our main protagonist, Satoru.  Starting off the series as a low confidence or energy being with a knack for being able to fix problems in the immediate area, Satoru is a relatable and very human character.  He's not made to be some time traveling wizard with a magic tool or anything of that sort, but as someone who has lived with regret in his life, as he has kept the thought of him having the chance to save Kayo from doom in the back of his mind for 15 years.  With each passing episode, Satoru metamorphosis into a character that really stands out from the show, becoming much more pleasant as a person and overall having development that looks and feels genuine.  You want him to succeed, you want him to have a good life, and you want him to stop the senseless murder and whatnot.  And that, is good development.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then we have Kayo, the other character who gets the brunt of the focus in this show.  As the primary 'damsel in distress', Kayo is a very similar character to Satoru in the regard that she also has this cynical or depressed view on life that really gets opened up as time goes on.  Due to the circumstances in her life, Kayo gradually changes after meeting and spending time with our main protagonist in his attempt to save her from her near death.  Many of the moments that we get with Kayo are genuinely sweet and actually make you care about her, which is wonderful because very little anime these days actually make their audience invest so much time into the characters that they present.  \\n\\n\r\nIt's sad that I have to basically shove everyone else into one paragraph, but it would take far too long to explain in detail just how well crafted and memorable each of these characters are.  You have Satoru's mom who is quite honestly anime mom of the year, Satoru's friends, who all get their own time in the spotlight, and Airi, a highschooler who...probably had a lot more impact to the series in the manga than the anime ever made her out to be.  Point is, most if not all of these characters evoke some sort of feeling from the audience, whether it'd be pity, joy, or distress, they are all much better than most underdeveloped pieces of shit you see today.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Very well-made cast\\n\r\n+ Great, gradual character development\\n\r\n+ Memorable side characters\\n\r\n-  Some side characters didn't have as much impact than they probably should've.  \\n\\n\r\nArt:  The art for the series is quite honestly...not as stellar as some of A-1's previous works.  (They made SAO, Shinsekai Yori, and Shigatsu.  Do you not see how pretty that shit is.)  While the color scheme for the series is very fitting as it has this drab color scheme that give it this lonely atmosphere, the actual artstyle for the characters and the settings are more or less on par with general animation today.  There's nothing particularly stellar about the visuals themselves.\\n\\n\r\nBut one special note that has to be made is the opening sequence.  The animation that goes along with the OP is one of the more meticulous and well crafted opening sequences that I've seen in recent years.  The animation that goes on in there is similar when compared to the show's standard animation, but what happen in the OP changes depending on where you are in the story.  Elements change over the course of the OP and it's a meticulous detail that quite honestly, is an effort that I really liked and commend.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  The opening visuals\\n\r\n+/-  Ok visuals (They're not stellar animation-wise)\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: The OP for Boku Dake is Re:Re: by Asian Kung-fu Generation, a rock song that surprisingly fits for the show.  It's a bit more upbeat than I would've liked for a show about murdering 6th graders, but it's a memorable piece of music that is honestly, quite addicting to listen to.  \\n\\n\r\nThe ED on the other hand is a somber yet hopeful piece that plays off of the overall theme of the show, which, while good, isn't a piece that I particularly find memorable.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Good tracks\\n\r\n-   ED isn't particularly memorable or as addicting as the OP.  \\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment:  Whenever a show becomes hyped to the extent that everyone who follows what airs in the next season builds it up saying it's going to be good, I always get a bit apprehensive, as the idea of what is 'good' varies from person to person, and many hyped shows in the past have been rather lackluster for me in the past.  Boku Dake however was an exceptionally rare occasion where I not only thought that the show deserved at least the majority of the hype that came behind it, but that it also was rather well written (in context to being an adaptation), and that I actually enjoyed myself when watching it.\\n\\n\r\nDid I like this anime?\\n\\n\r\nSurprisingly, yes.  I really enjoyed this show.  Maybe it was because Kayo had so many adorable moments that you just wanted to hug her, or the fact that the show kept roping me in week after week to the point that episodes felt like they lasted only but a minute, but I really didn't think that this show was going to turn out as well as I thought or the fact that I would even be remotely praising it.  Well done, A-1.\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this anime?\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I felt Airi was severly underused.  She's a coworker of Satoru's that really never got much attention in the series at all.  She had a few choice moments and seemed to really be important to Satoru's life, but we just never got to see much of her, and that REALLY bugged me.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this anime?\\n\\n\r\nIf you've read the manga, I personally don't think you should watch this anime.  Mostly due to the fact that A-1 had to take some liberties to craft a half-decent adaptation of the Boku Dake manga due to the fact that some events and/or details are missing or out of place.  However, if you haven't read the manga, and want a good mystery show, this is definitely a good one to start with.  As a standalone adaptation, Boku Dake excels at being a well made adaptation that can tell the story that it was meant to be told in its entirety without the viewer needing to read the original source material beforehand.  This is a somewhat rare occurrence these days, and I'm glad time was spent on really trying to make this as good as an adaptation as it could be.",

However, each to their own.\r\nBoku dake ga Inai Machi, also known as Erased, was a perfect blend of everything I seek in an anime. It scored perfectly on animation, music, character development and plot. I won\u2019t dwell too much on the plot since it might lead to a spoiler but the story was unique and well-constructed. The transition of the anime was well-paced, not too slow or too fast and I think it\u2019s because the team made a great decision to keepit short to 12 episodes only. I\u2019m sure it would have been a drag if it was stretched to 20+ episodes so kudos to whoever decided on that.\\n\r\nThe key to the anime\u2019s success was because of the emotional attachment to the characters. Every character (good or bad) were unique and diverse in their own way. They felt real and I wanted to do everything to protect them (not the bad guy though). In addition, they also raised awareness about issues like domestic violence at home, single moms raising kids and even bullying at school. \\n\r\nThe anime was greatly hyped out about and I was wary to watch it because I was afraid I\u2019ll be disappointed but I was not let down even for a minute. It started and ended perfectly.",

            "content": "Choosing between a 9 and a 10 for this anime is one of the hardest reviewing decisions I've had to make recently.\r\nMuch as I wanted to give it a 10 overall, 10 signifies masterpiece, perfection -- and while this anime was close (very, very close), a few blunders near the end (specifically the last two episodes) kept it from that pedestal.\r\nThe greatest triumph of this anime is in its directing, scene building, and editing.  Seriously, the bulk majority of this show is like getting a masterclass lesson of direction.  There are scenes in this show I could dissect a hundred different ways.The cinematography is just astounding.\\n\\n\r\nIt's clear that the source material manga for this anime is not very fantastic.  But what the writers/director have done with that material is a miracle.  They took a 5 or 6 out of 10 manga and turned it into what is surely one of the best anime I have ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nThe first couple episodes, specifically 2-4, are certainly 10/10.  Those episodes are the peak of the show, and we never get anything later in the show quite as nice as Satoru's gradual befriending of Kayo.\\n\\n\r\nThe weak moments are always surprising, because you would expect that whoever had the vision to craft episodes 2-4 would know how corny it is to have Kayo's grandma appear and fall on her knees crying to ask for her daughter's forgiveness.  Bleh.\\n\\n\r\nI'm rambling a bit, there's no real structure to this.  I will say about the \"mystery\" aspect... that there isn't much mystery.  This show is never really framed as a whodunnit, despite the police lineups in the OP.  There are no red herrings, no tricks of the plot.  What you see is what you get with this one.  I think I prefer it that way, too.  It gives the show more time to spend enjoying the relationships it so arduously built up in those brilliant first four episodes.\\n\\n\r\nBoku Dake is an anime I am sure to revisit many times in the future whenever I want to be reminded that some anime CAN achieve good character building, some anime CAN have visionary direction, some anime CAN tell an enthralling story without resorting to tropes older than I am.\\n\\n\r\nIf not for those last few episodes, we'd be looking at a masterpiece.  What we got instead was something very close.  I think in the beginning and middle, the directory had the freedom to make what he wanted to make, but near the end he was constrained to the limits of the manga he was working with.  It's sad but I'm okay with it, because in all honesty, this manga got an anime adaptation far better than what it deserved.",

            "content": "This show can certainly not be called a masterpiece by everyone who watches it. Like anything, it has it's flaws and it's shortcomings. However, I genuinely think that the things it does well massively outshines everything that is does badly. Boku Dake ga Inai Machi, or the english title Erased (Translated literally to A Town Where Only I Am Missing/A Town Without Me) is a show that handles the supernatural/thriller aspect very well, by telling a story of a man named Satoru with a strange ability to go back in time right before tragedy strikes in his vicinity, effectively allowing him to prevent the accidentbefore it happens. Through this talent, he stops numerous accidents and saves many lives. One fateful day, tragedy strikes close to home, and Satoru is mysteriously sent back 18 years into the past to when he was eleven years old, discovering that the murders of his classmates by a loose killer have not yet taken place. Intent on stopping the deaths of his classmates, the first being the lonely Kayo Hinazuki, Satoru sets out to save his classmates while at the same time apprehending the unknown killer.\\n\\n\r\n(10/10) Right off the bat, the plot from just the synopsis will catch pretty much anybody's attention if they have interest in the supernatural/thriller genres. While the supernatural aspect is only really important at certain points in the story, it doesn't take away from the experience in any way. From the very first episode, any watcher will be gripped by the story's atmosphere, it's rapidly moving plot, and it's mysterious approach to a genre that is not always executed well. It handles serious and psychological tones very well and injects a shocking amount of realism into a seemingly supernatural scenario, which can be appreciated by fans of almost any genre. Each episode ends of a cliffhanger, which will likely make you want to watch the entire series in one go if you had any interest. The story, in my opinion, keeps a set of well done story arcs contained nicely inside the twelve episode limit and ends with an impeccably satisfying conclusion, and doesn't once falter with it's tones and genres. The pacing is excellent and there is never a sense of confusion or a feeling that some events were too rushed throughout.\\n\\n\r\n(9/10) The art is very good. The character design and style is done in a unique but very visually appealing way that is certain to not deter anyone from watching. The backgrounds are done well and manages to keep a very isolated and lonely atmosphere, which I found very effective. The animation is also excellent and there aren't any notable instances where it was plainly bad or awkward. The only reason I wouldn't give the art a 10 is because it could be considered bland and doesn't have any real outstanding value.\\n\\n\r\n(10/10) The sound in this anime is excellent. The music choices and overall sound design was just spot on, I found myself constantly being entranced by the amazing soundtrack and great sound effects when it came to the supernatural aspects of the show and even the cinematic expositional portions that tie together certain events.\\n\\n\r\n(8/10) I feel that the only real place the show is lacking is with it's characters. I just felt that there wasn't any really interesting personalities that stood out, or were unique from the general medium of archetypes. As the show leans heavily on the story portion, the characters themselves are good and they certainly won't make you stop watching. In fact, there aren't any overly annoying or unrealistic characters per-se. They were still largely well developed and good enough to earn an 8 from me.\\n\r\n- The protagonist, Satoru, starts off as a broody, solemn and relatively depressed 29 year old man who works as a manga artist. Thanks to numerous publishing denials, he finds himself relying on working at a pizza place to make a stable income. Once the plot kicks in and Satoru is suddenly reliving his life as an eleven year old, he becomes intent on saving his three classmates that are set to be murdered by a loose killer in the future. There are a few problems regarding Satoru's personality, the largest being that although a clear sense of maturity is established in his eleven year old state, Satoru still acts largely childish and thinks that he is the only one who can stop the murders from taking place. His inner personality, one that wasn't fully portrayed in his 29 year old self, appears to be completely based around acting as an agent of justice, an aspect which is continually developed as the show progresses. By the time the story arc had ended, there was almost no trace of Satoru's former self that could be found. Although I don't find this to be a particularly unrealistic character progression, I found it rather annoying and archetypal as it essentially was carbon cut from other \"heroes of justice\" portrayed in anime. Overall, I liked Satoru's character but there are evident flaws that needed to be addressed.\\n\r\n- Kayo Hinazuki is the first victim of the murderer, thus the first person which Satoru needed to save. Kayo herself is a \"loner\" type character, one that purposely distances herself from making relationships with others due to some kind of personal reason. This archetype is commonly used in the medium, and thus didn't help towards making her a likable character at first glance. However, as Satoru builds his relationship with the mysterious girl, she starts to open up and become a lot more likable. Satoru discovers that she was being beaten by her abusive mother, and that she was simply acting apathetic in hopes on one day becoming so. Her character arc is very good and is commonly considered the high point of the show by it's viewers. \\n\r\n- Kenya Kobayashi is Satoru's classmate, and can easily be considered a genius by both adult standards and his friends. He is a reoccurring character that contributes largely to Satoru's motivations and eventually the outcome of the story. While Kenya himself doesn't have many particularly interesting personality quirks, he tends to be far smarter than it's realistically possible for a ten year old to be which is sometimes jarring and just outright annoying. He regularly advances the plot and generally is a large help to Satoru as he embarks on his quest.  \\n\r\n- Airi is Satoru's co-worker at the pizza place he works at. While she isn't a particularly important character in the show as it largely takes place in the past, she brings important character development to Satoru and is generally a likable, confident, and independent high school girl.\\n\r\n- Sachiko is Satoru's mom, who is an important character throughout the series. She constantly proves to be a brilliant mother that genuinely cares for her son, and knows him so well she can easily predict what he's thinking and what he's planning in any given situation. She's a very good and well developed character that is a crucial element in the story. \\n\\n\r\n(10/10) The conclusion and my overall enjoyment of this show are good enough for it to earn a 10. It has a captivating, thrilling storyline that describes a very realistic struggle despite an unrealistic prerequisite. It is certain to keep anybody entertained for the amount of time it takes to watch it, warranting my recommendation to definitely check it out. The conclusion manages to wrap up almost all unresolved plotlines, while leaving few plotholes and unanswered questions. It is very well established that the story is complete, leaving zero room for a continuation. While again, it may not be 100% perfect, it is definitely good enough to be placed on anybody's watchlist, whether they're a fan of the genre or not.",

            "content": "Boku dake ga Inai Machi or more popularly known as ERASED is one of the best anime to come out of the 2016 roster. And it's probably the only one that I invested my weeks to. \r\nStory (9): I was actually scared to watch this show because the present situation of the character Satoru Fujinuma is something I kind of attach myself to. He's become detached to the world so forth and so forth. But then I watched it and I feel like I can't have ignored this anime at all. I'll probably won't be the same person. The tension is built up well. Situationsare intense whilst also providing a bit of comfort here and there. What's great about the story of ERASED is that you want to know more as it progresses. After every episode, you wish to know more and more.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9): A-1 Pictures has done it again. One thing I love about A-1 is that they take the concept of the mangaka's art and further it, making it appealing. The colors, textures of each backdrop are beautiful to look at and it thoroughly feels like your in Japan. Animation-wise, there's not much action but the movements are fluid and easy and if there's a need to rush certain scenes, it's done with precision while maintaining the dignity of the art.\\n\\n\r\nSound (10): Building tension for such a suspensful anime can be quite the challenge and adding some background music or sounds amps up the scene, making it somehow haunting or in such cases, carefree. But I have to give credit for the amazing OP and ED of this show. Re:Re has actually been out since 2006 and it's such a fit to use it because the time of this anime is not necessarily set in 2016 but more in the early or late 2000s so it seemed appropriate. The ending is both adorable and sad which adds to the feel of the characters. The voice actors are amazing! I have to commend Mitsushima-san. He's not a seiyuu, and I guess that adds to the humanity of his character. Tsuchiya-san as the young Satoru, knowing that she isn't a seiyuu brought a simplicity to her performance and made everything seemed more understandable and reachable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (9): There are many characters in this show but you have to take into consideration that there are only a few people involved at the whole thing in all honesty. I was so scared watching as bits and pieces started to fall into place and you somehow wish that it weren't true. Satoru is a flawed character trying to fix everything with his power. It also comes with a price yet he didn't give up and that's why I loved him. I felt like some of the characters that we came to love suddenly vanished and didn't become part of the story. I feel like the ending was rushed for any of the characters to be appreciated when they came back. That's just me though.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9): It's not necessarily a show that will give you HAHA's because it's not that. It's a psychologically scarring show about how life can definitely be filled with twists and turns and we're lucky enough if we get the chance to do something about it. I enjoyed this anime very much and wished it was a few episodes longer.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9): Boku dake ga Inai Machi or ERASED is a show you have to see if you like thrilling anime. I suggest you don't read the manga or research it to get warped into the series.",

            "content": "Originality is a term which is tossed around in the anime and film industry, often to write off a show before scratching the surface of its plot or components, but is originality really what we think it is? A recycled or clich\u00e9 basis for a story does not on its own make something unoriginal. Originality can be found in the events and story which stem from this \u201cplot device\u201d; in the characters and their design; and in the execution and artistic expression of a show. Boku dake ga Inai Machi (\u201cErased\u201d being its anglicised title) is a time-travel anime which is by no means thefirst of its kind, yet it seeps uniqueness and originality through the way it is presented and through the way it uses its common premise.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe main character, Satoru Fujinuma, has the ability to go back in time to prevent disasters from occurring. This is quite circumstantial, as the anime never touches upon his ability to time travel, however this allows us to focus more on the plot which it opens up. There is no need to complain about \u201cplot convenience\u201d here \u2013 all stories need a basis on which to be written. \\n\r\nWe are thrown straight into the plot when, as an adult, our main character is framed for the murder of his own mother, and is then sent all the way back to his childhood where he seeks to save his quiet and deeply afflicted classmate Kayo Hinazuki from her death, believing that the actions of an unknown serial killer were linked with the death of his mother. The result at first was a mysterious and intriguing detective-like plot as the main character pieces together the puzzle linking these cases, which certainly had me hooked. However, it eventually turned into the story of a self-proclaimed \u201chero\u201d trying to save the lives of future murder victims. The mystery was eventually solved by mere circumstance, preventing the 10/10 ending which I was anticipating one-third through the season.\\n\r\nIn a series of just 12-episode, it is essential that each episode count, and only a couple of times have I felt dissatisfied after 23 minutes of Erased. What this show does well is focusing on the plot and making sure that each instalment is eventful and drives the plot forward, rather than bringing it to a temporary halt. As a result, the final product hardly feels underdeveloped, and did well exhibit the ever-too-common symptoms of short series.\\n\r\nFinally, this anime does not fall into that pile of refuse that the industry seasonally excretes, where a decent concept is belittled by copious amounts of cookie-cutter characters and ecchi fan service. For the most part, Erased stays to the point, and it definitely does descend into this cheap realm of entertainment. I promise that from OP to ED you won't have a second of your time wasted through these means.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation for this show were spot-on: everything appears detailed and easy on the eye, while having just enough harshness and a distinct cold hue to fit in with and enhance the mysterious and almost sinister tone of the story. The character design is original enough and doesn't feature random moe, twintails and oppai for the sake of moe, twintails and oppai. Erased does not give off the \"another generic anime\" feeling, but instead something you can genuinely admire for not being the same old shit.\\n\r\nI was also particularly impressed by the (virtual) camerawork in this anime. The panning shots and the general positioning and movement of the perspective felt very professional, fluid and movie-like. This kind of cinematography can generate a feeling of grandeur in an otherwise ordinary scene. I would certainly like to see more of this in anime in the future. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is subtle and by no means overdone - what you get is pleasing to the ear and complements the scene well where music is used. I think that a strong OST is, though often overlooked, extremely important as a soundtrack can make or break a scene. As usual, Yuki Kajiura conveyed the correct emotions in each of the tracks she composed for the scenes in Erased, and each one was beautiful on its own.\\n\r\nAs for the OP, it is an addictive song with some nice guitar playing in the background. No ear-rupturing loli voices or screaming death metal bands here: instead an intrinsically catchy song which I haven't skipped once. It wouldn\u2019t quite make my all-time favourites list, but it\u2019s the time of song which you would keep coming back to hear. The ED is actually OK, but drives me crazy due to some head-splitting frequencies. I am quite unsure why the ED was the main soundtrack advertised in the previews for this anime. To each his own.\\n\r\nOverall, the soundtrack is perfect in its own right: Kajiura pulls off yet another oeuvre d\u2019art, but not as outstanding as some of her other works. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nA lot of attention was clearly put into the characters of Boku dake ga Inai Machi with each one seeming genuinely human and well-developed, even if they are only supporting. For example, Satoru's friend, Kenya, is presented as \"the intelligent one\" but has a deep and evident personality beyond that which makes him, and a multitude of other characters, feel... real.\\n\r\nMy main qualm with the characters in Erased, is that a lot of them play an insignificant role. Many of these characters were, as mentioned, very well designed, but some of them tended to disappear from the story. I would have liked to see Kenya play a more significant role, as well as Satoru\u2019s mother, as these were two characters who had the intellect to make an impact on the events in the story.\\n\r\nI find the 2 main characters, Satoru and Kayo, particularly intriguing. Satoru Fujinuma is a man in his late 20's before being sent back to his childhood, where he retains his serious and mature mind-set. Apart from demonstrating an admirable sense of sheer determination, the way he questions and comments on everything with intense scrutiny and critical thinking makes his running internal monologue fascinating to listen to... he is already one of my favourite male leads.\\n\r\nKayo Hinazuki is, in the main arc of the story, a young and troubled girl, who is considered the quiet one of the class. However, her personality opens up slightly for Satoru as she develops into a much warmer, more charming character. Scenes with her can come across as both depressing and heart-warming.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nErased never fails to be interesting and gripping, and I have enjoyed every second of it. The undeterred focus on the story with tiny snippets of non-intrusive comedy make for an engaging and entertaining experience, without the frustration of time-wasting filler or fan service scenes, which would have really damaged such a short series with that had little time to waste. The brilliant art and cinematography make for a pleasing visual experience, the likes of which I\u2019m eager to see more of in upcoming anime.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\\n\r\nIs this worth watching? That\u2019s hardly the main question here - if you want to witness something genuinely unique, well thought-out, well executed, and credible at the very least, of course you should. Is this a masterpiece? Perhaps not. The use of chance and circumstance as a plot device towards the end of the story were disappointing and prevented this show from achieving perfection, though it had the potential to early on. What does set Boku dake ga Inai Machi apart from the plethora of alternative anime available is that it is straight to the point and makes full use of the 12 episode time frame which it had, and what makes it stand out is its effort \u2013 particularly in the visual department \u2013 and its originality. \\n\\n\r\n~Appilesh~ \\n",

            "content": "Boku dake ga Inai Machi [Erased] Is properly one of the best anime's i seen in. it knows how to tell a story and gets the the point. it doesn't have that typical anime cliches you would usually see.\r\nStory 11/10. If i could give it a much higher score i could. the Story is something that you can like really follow. it gets right the point of the main plot. it knows how the tell it the right way. ending each episode with a cliffhanger making you want to come back to see the next episode. Using Cause and Effect alot in each Episode. plusjust when everything seems to be going good something whines up blocking the main protagonists way from what he was doing.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10. (i will have art and setting in the same spot) the art of the story is really relaxing. from the winter setting of the 1988 scenes to the summer of 2006. using time accurate vehicles and Buildings. no like cell phones in the 1988 scene cause their really wasn't any cellphones even flip phones back then. and using flip phones for the 2006 scenes. cause like flip phones was the thing back then. it really gives you that it could happen feeling.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10. the sound is really good. at some parts you can notice some off. like ambiance noises of some locations. but you would really have to pay Attention to really pin point it. but overall the sounds and voices are really spot on. the voice actors fit there Characters really well. Plus the OP and ED fit really well with the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10. The Character Development is like really good. you can get what everyone feeling at that point and time and specially the main protagonist you can really make out his feelings and how he reactions at certain points of time.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10. If feels like an movie that you cant get up and leave to use the restroom cause you don't want to miss something important even if you can pause the episode. you will be locked onto this anime. its just the enjoyable. and i cant wait to see how it ends. the re-watch valve for this anime is really high.\\n\\n\r\nso my Overall rating is pretty obvious 10/10. the anime knows how to capture the views eyes, tell a super story. this is a good mix for an anime. i would like to see more anime like this. and i hope you all enjoy is as well.",

            "content": "Boku Dake ga Inai machi - The Town where only I am missing. It's an interesting title, and it's also the title of a sad little essay written by an abused young girl within the show, about how her town would be without her alone - and how she doesn't mind that at all.\r\nReading that, you might be wondering what exactly the show is about. Isn't this supposed to be a show wherein the protagonist jumps back in time in order to find a murderer and stop him? Well, it is, but what makes the show so special is that it chooses to focus muchon it's time on human drama rather than the murder mystery. Instead of having the focus be on finding out who the murderer is, the protagonist uses his knowledge from the future in order to help the victims - removing their 'alone time' so that the murderer would not have a chance to act. It's an interesting choice, and one that ultimately benefits the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe path the show takes allows it to have a very strong first half - probably one of the most emotionally powerful and great experiences that I have experienced in the medium. It's easily the high of the show, following the protagonist as he works to befriend and bring joy into the life of a girl who faces painful physical abuse at home to the extent that she wishes that she herself could simply disappear. This portion is aided by very strong visuals and direction, as well as the contrast between the short and painful scenes of home abuse compared to the moments and glimmers of hope and joy that the protagonist brings into her life. It's an arc that is both uplifting and painful at the same time - and something that could have perhaps worked even better without the mystery backdrop that the rest of the show focuses on.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the rest of the show simply isn't as strong as that first half. As a human drama, the show is brilliant. As a thriller, it works okay, having many strong scenes with plenty of tension, plenty of little directional quirks combined with a conflict that the audience is easily invested in, making the show highly entertaining at most points, though the direction does go a little overboard into silly territory at points.  As a mystery, however, it pales in comparison. Due to the setup of the show, the focus eventually has to shift towards answering the big question - who did it? Unfortunately, the show never really takes the time to set up potential suspects - it does take the time to throw a little suspicion here and there at times, but the 'answer' is really obvious as time goes by since there is only one plausible suspect. It simply doesn't function all that well as a murder mystery, making the later half of the show seem that much weaker as a result.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough it might seem from what I have written that the show has two distinct halves, it must still be noted that the show does a fairly good job of maintaining its core thematic threads throughout the show, most notably though the growth of our protagonist - showcasing the themes of the importance of hope and believing in other people, as well as that of having the courage to take that first step to get to know others on a more personal level. It does portray it's message well, managing to wrap up the show quite well thematically.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, is the show worth watching? Definitely. Although some might find the end result a disappointing one due to the initial hype that the first few episodes brought, it is still a very strong show that simply peaked really early on. Despite that, the rest of the show is still fairly good if unremarkable, and the high points of the show were easily some of the strongest and most powerful episodes in the medium. It's still a great show overall, and one that I would easily recommend any day.",

            "content": "DaikiClub Bro Time-Saver Review:\r\nBLUF: Erased (yes I use slave names) was the best anime of the season. I heavily recommend it if you like mysteries. 9/10\r\nStory- Ok the story suffers the same fate as Death Note. All the hype and lead up is great but the ending is trash. The first 9 episodes are perfect from a story board point of view, there are multiple plot twists that I didn't see coming. They also handled time travel pretty well which is hard to do (i.e Future Diary). The ending was just so stupid. They Scooby Doo you and there's other bullshit you'll just have tosee yourself. It still gets a 9 because the majority was so good.\\n\\n\r\nArt- I liked it. It's A-1 so they weren't going to fuck up this part  (like they do everything else usually). It's clean and pretty and I enjoyed looking at it. 8\\n\\n\r\nSound- The vocals were really good and fit the characters well. I don't speak Japanese so I'm not too hip to that type of critique. But the opening and closing were good and so was the score. No complaints, I liked hearing it. 7\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- Umm this one is interesting. I really liked Satoru as a character and he developed a lot for a 12 episode anime. I also liked how the characters all had some sort of defining factor that was key to the story without you knowing it. They handled character development well because it was REALISTIC. A lot of anime have weird character arcs that make no sense, I think Erased did it well. 8\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- I said it like 6 times, I liked it man. I would recommend it to anybody, even people who don't watch anime. It was fuckin' great and easily the best of the season. The mystery was entertaining and the character development had real sustenance. The art and sound was solid too. It's 12 episodes just watch it! 10\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR Watch it and enjoy. Don't nitpick, just have fun watching a good anime. \\n",

            "content": "Boku Dake ga Inai Machi makes us question our standards of the shows we watch. Is it enough for a show to make you enjoy watching it, or does the conclusion have to feel satisfying in order for it to become a good show? I find myself in the primary camp, as throughout the show, I can honestly say that it was very enjoyable, even though several plot points made me raise my eyebrow.\r\nThe main character here is Satoru, a guy who is able to travel back in time but cannot control how. This premise gives the storyteller a lot of freedom in controlling howthe story goes, and he uses it pretty well, starting with several setbacks to develop the main character and slowly building resolve until he overcomes his obstacles.\\n\\n\r\nDon't expect too much action, a huge chunk of the story plays more like a slice of life instead of a thriller. The show devotes a lot of time to the interactions of the main character; Satoru starts off as someone pretty awkward, but grows as a result of interacting with different people. This approach however results in several characters ending up pretty shortchanged by the conclusion of the series with their motivations not clearly defined, which can end up making several plot twists unsatisfying.\\n\\n\r\nParts of the story play off as one written by an amateur who knows how to connect plot points but not always successful in his experiments with the plot outline. The main villain felt mostly like an excuse to get the main character to interact with others, and there were several moments in the show that came off as very goofy. Making characters cartoony can work as a means of making a show easier to understand, but Boku Dake ga Inai Machi uses it often which takes you out of the moment frequently.\\n\\n\r\nDespite saying all that, I have to say that this series did make me relate to the characters a lot more than most existing anime. Even when the events were pretty cliche, you felt something for the people while they were on screen. When they interacted, it felt real, and with a lot of really nice people in the cast the show was always a joy to watch. Isn't that all that matters?",

            "content": "Erased is one of the best shows that I've watched in years. It masterfully balances dark, unsettling themes with those of the beauty of friendship and the redemptive properties of love and boldly and unapologetically presents some of the harsh realities of life whilst still managing to be introspective and thoughtful. This is by no means an easy feat and is a testament to the incredible talent of the show's staff. If that wasn't enough to convince you to watch Erased, keep reading. I hope to present you with many more compelling reasons.\r\nStory\r\nI recently watched Orange, another show that featured its characters using time-travel toright the wrongs of the past, so I didn't expect to find Erased as gripping as I did. However, the stakes were even higher than those in Orange, with multiple characters facing the prospect of destroyed reputations, imprisonment, and even horrible deaths. Also similar to Orange was Erased's decision to focus, not on the exact science behind time-travel, but on exploring its somewhat heavy themes, e.g., the devastating effect that abject loneliness and abuse can have on a child. Such themes did make the show difficult to watch at points, but they were, nevertheless, handled expertly. Erased didn't shy away from or censor said abuse, but tackled it head-on, whilst still managing to be introspective and thoughtful. The show often prompted viewers to consider if one should resign oneself to one's circumstances or fight tooth and nail to save oneself \u2013 even if that could have untold effects on other people. It was refreshing to see such topics broached. Whilst we all need distractions from the harsh realities of life (and anime can often provide that) some things just shouldn't be ignored. By ignoring such realities we can allow abuse to occur or to continue uninterrupted. Erased also had many twists and turns, enough to keep me on the edge of my seat until its extremely satisfying conclusion, a conclusion that reminded viewers of the beauty of friendship and of the redemptive properties of love, all without being cringey and nauseating.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nErased had many likeable characters. What endeared them to me was their courage in the face of such horrible situations and their willingness to trust in the ones they loved, no matter how circumstances made them appear. Such purity of character was refreshing to see. Also impressive was the amount of character development Satoru underwent in just 12 episodes. He went from being a dispassionate loner to an extremely brave, spirited young man willing to trust his life to or risk it for his family and friends. And yet this development didn't feel forced or rushed, but natural and gradual. My only criticism would be that a couple of the children (not including Satoru) behaved unrealistically adult for children and that the killer's motives weren't incredibly clear, however, these in no way detracted from my immense enjoyment of the show.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nBoth the background art and the character designs of Erased were wonderful to behold. This may seem relatively unimportant, but I liked that the characters had prominent mouths and noses. This is a design choice that you don't see in many shows these days, but it gave the show a distinctive look that I really appreciated.\\n\\n\r\nMusic\\n\r\nI loved both the opening and ending tracks. I'm a big fan of Asian Kung-Fu Generation (who performed the opening track) and the ending track was dramatic and powerful. The background music was also enjoyable, perfectly adding to a scene's tension or drama when necessary.\\n\\n\r\nOverall enjoyment\\n\r\nNothing could possibly add to my enjoyment of Erased. Its story was gripping and conjured a range of responses from the viewer. At times I was elated and moved, whereas at other times I was shocked and tense. You couldn't help but root for many of its characters, given their pure hearts and sincere love for each other. Its music and art were also flawless. Like an especially delicious dessert, I just found myself wanting more and more and regretted finally having to finish it. This is quite possibly one of the best new shows I've watched in years, earning one of my rare 10/10s on MAL. I would strongly urge you to watch Erased.",

            "content": "It doesn't take much for an anime to be great. Great dubs, beautiful animation, addicting soundtracks, creative premises... all of those are just icing on the cake. All of which ERASED has in spades, mind you. So what's the point of this review other than the glaring 5 I've given this show? It's that there are shows that are bad, and then there are shows that are disappointments.\r\nAh ERASED. 2016's answer to the mystery thriller genre or another one of A-1 Pictures' additions to the trash heap? Find out as I try to resist the urge to say how much it betrays the high expectationsit sets from the get-go.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY - 3\\n\\n\r\nERASED is either the story of:\\n\\n\r\na. Time travel and its consequences on the psyche.\\n\r\nb. A kid detective's attempts to foil a local serial killer.\\n\r\nc. A boy's re-coming-of-age when he is given the chance to redo his childhood.\\n\r\nd. All and none of the above.\\n\\n\r\n'A' would've worked if it weren't for zero attention given to the mechanics of our fortunate protagonist's power. Does it need some sort of gadget? No. Does he need to recite an incantation, bite his finger, or even pray? Maybe. Or does it work only when the author wants it to? Bingo. The logic works for the first few do-overs because it usually activates when something bad's about to happen. But after the massive time leap, that's when rules get broken to preserve the mystery and suspense. And as for his psyche, well, he certainly doesn't give up easily, recovers fairly quickly, and is pretty hell-bent on saving lives since his power gave him a hero complex.\\n\\n\r\nThough 'A' might have only been an excuse to introduce 'B' and 'C' since those were the bulk of the story, the results were not worth the buildup. Not only is our protagonist up against the most predictable of antagonists, he also wins by an ass-pull just because fate favors him more, as the story so literally puts it.\\n\\n\r\n'C' would've been the show's saving grace. We're given a protagonist who's an aspiring manga artist, social recluse, and closet hero; good ingredients for a self-made late-bloomer. In giving him the uncanny scenario of redoing his childhood to clear his name, save lives and possibly even vanquish a greater evil, he learns to appreciate his mother's tireless love, a stranger's hidden life, and his friends' warm company. All of that juicy development, wasted. \\n\\n\r\nIn the last quarter, ERASED manages to take back any semblance of morals it tries to impart in the beginning by making him the smug, angsty, plot-armored hero in the most jarring way possible. The not-so-subtle antagonist, seen episodes away from his big reveal, manages to one-up Satoru in his own game and even cripple him out of sheer spite. Despite the best A-game our bad guy played, Satoru still talks him to submission with a speech that could be summed up as \"You can't kill me because you need me.\" ERASED's protagonist outright abuses his hero status and it feels like wish fulfillment more than anything. \\n\\n\r\nWe have our heroes like Shirou from Fate Stay Night. Despite incessantly prattling on about his ideals on saving everyone but himself, he is hardly a role model. A self-destructive martyr who cannot see meaning in his own life is one of the many takes on a hero. And then you have heroes like Satoru, who burst out of an 18-year coma like nothing happened just to brag to the bad guy how pathetic he is because he doesn't have the cool powers, friends, and the balls to even finish his job. The only take of a hero you can get from this is that a hero makes his own story, literally. He is tasked with a power to beat the evil with help from his friends. Nothing, not even the plot can stop him.\\n\\n\r\nBecause of this, the development during the childhood arc becomes nothing but shallow drama for a power of friendship boost come the show's sorry excuse for a climax. Heck, what's the purpose of him being a manga artist other than for wish fulfillment? Him wanting to be the hero he writes about seems the most logical reason for this, hence more fuel for misplaced narcissism instead of actual writing effort.\\n\\n\r\nERASED is stuck on the 'D'. Every scenario is introduced and executed well, no doubt, but is given little to no afterthought. ERASED's story is like a pad of post-it notes, each idea covered up with another, all glued by intrigue. As time goes on and the glue wears off, all you're left with is a colorful mess. What about the cool time travel power? What about the omnipresent evil always one step ahead of him? What about the rest of the cast? It's a sci-fi supernatural mystery thriller drama sure, but why does it need to incorporate so much when it could've easily focused on any one of its subplots and fully fleshed them out? It's like putting your favorite food in a blender thinking the result is going to be better.\\n\\n\r\nART - 9\\n\\n\r\nI won't shy away from the hate, but I GOTTA SAY, it's gorgeous. Consistent high quality art and animation all series round. The introspective movie theatre opening was a real visual treat too. But the real winners here are the character designs, alongside color and shading.\\n\\n\r\nThe designs are delicate and familiar which further enhances how the childhood arc plays out. Elementary school never looked so nostalgic. And for a high-stakes thriller, it's hard to wrap your head around how adorable the children in the cast are. The warm and cozy feel of the character designs beautifully juxtapose the cold and distant color tones they're bathed in, all the more with the bulk of the show taking place in winter. The high clarity of the outlines are given stark attention against faded hues and unsaturated color palettes like they were representing memorable events the characters were not fond of. With this visual discord, the show cleverly creates aural tension without relying on plot or exposition.\\n\\n\r\nThe cinematography is also a marvel. Whether it's the bright and bustling blandness of the city or the dream-like quality of 1988, ERASED's rich setpieces are very clear framing devices: modern day urban Japan representing the reality of Satoru's situation as a job-hopping nobody and his rural neighborhood reflecting the person he wants to be, a more outgoing and dependable friend. The near-perfect marriage of subtle color hints and appealing designs all set on solid, expressive backgrounds show how much ERASED speaks without words.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND - 9\\n\\n\r\nDespite the variable payoff the show ultimately delivers, one can both praise or blame the amount of immersion ERASED set since episode one. Largely benefitting from a spot-on soundtrack permeating tension and unease all throughout, ERASED is an experience. Ambience is given top priority with tracks just meshing with the distinct visuals, making one man's struggle against fate all the more riveting (than how it actually is). \\n\\n\r\nThe opening's catchy yet nostalgic vibe by Indie Rock wonders, Kung Fu Generation, is also a delightful leftfield to the more somber tone of the series. Combined with the literal symbolism of being an audience to your life, it precedes the show's themes of taking action on your life instead of watching it pass you by (despite its failure to communicate this message effectively in the series).\\n\\n\r\nLastly, what can I say about the dub? It made the show tolerable for starters. In fact, it singlehandedly carried the show through for me. When the plot let me down, the dub was there to let me know in the best way possible at least. \\n\\n\r\nBenjamin Diskin as Satoru made him such a relatable character with so much focus on his inner monologues as he solved the mystery back and forth in time. Michelle Ruff as his younger self does a remarkable job as well in keeping consistent with Satoru's character while sounding as natural as a grade schooler. Equal parts snarky, and equal parts serious, his character was as entertaining as the show can get. But what really knocked the show out of the park was his mother, Sachiko. Her voice by Sara Cravens flowed so well from being this detached woman with a tinge of playful immaturity to the most loving and badass mother in any anime I've ever seen. Period. Then there's Stephanie Sheh's Kayo who expresses waves of her character with how wary and distant she speaks. Satoru's friends also fit perfectly, as if they were an actual tight bunch of elementary school friends. While the teacher couldn't have been voiced better by David Collins, giving him a father-like yet an almost, too friendly feel to him, Cherami Leigh as Airi was a wasted opportunity. She nailed her voice as the easy-going girl next door but could've been more integral to the plot, not that it would've made it any less of a disaster.\\n\\n\r\nBoth tender at its warmest and gripping at its core, ERASED boasts a soundscape I dare say it doesn't even deserve. A top-tier soundtrack, chilling atmosphere, earwormy opening, and well-directed English dub could probably be enough to save this show, right? Right?\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS - 4\\n\\n\r\nActually no. Bite me.\\n\\n\r\nEntertaining? Oh yeah. Intriguing? Most definitely. Fleshed-out? As much as mannequins. Everybody is a one-sided plot device carefully set in a stage full of bells and whistles to keep you from noticing.\\n\\n\r\nYeah, we have the chosen one, Satoru, who is nothing more than a self-declared hero with an ego bigger than his denial of being a closet pedophile. Airi, pizza girl and damsel in distress number 1. Sachiko, best mom. Kayo, damsel in distress number 2 who has slowly become less... distressed, as she opens herself up to the warmth of her friends. And Gaku, the teacher who teaches Satoru a very important lesson in not using your power to meddle in other people's hobbies.\\n\\n\r\nIs the protagonist flawed? Do the damsels learn to help themselves out? Can we sympathize with the villain? Questions all answerable by a big fat NO on the surface. But there's a lot more going on with the inner workings of the story that effectively 'disable' our characters' opportunities for growth.\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist is flawed to be honest. He fails every time in trying to correct a wrong he started. Remember, everything that occurs in ERASED is due to the bad guy having the upper hand. The villain already knows what's going on in this game of clairvoyance and time travel, all because naive Satoru feels the need to play the hero every chance he gets. In fact, his own hero complex is his flaw, which catapults the story into taking place. \\n\\n\r\nBut what makes him a weak protagonist in my eyes is how the plot straps training wheels on him the entire show. The time travel gimmick is a handy reset button, and apparently, his persuasion skill is maxed out to game-breaking proportions. Seriously, he did NOT encounter any meaningful conflict in the story. The plot always found a way to script him to salvation. He was just stuck on hero mode until the end with every event slowly filling his ego.\\n\\n\r\nKayo and especially Airi could've been so much more than rescue objectives but because of time travel and a Satoru-centric tale, we get stagnant NPCs who are out of the loop, just waiting for their time of use.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the villain... OH GOD WHY did you have to be the villain? It was bad enough it was so painfully obvious that you were the bad guy and yet the show makes it feel like it pulled the biggest rug under you. We know the antagonist is there to challenge the protagonist's morals and actions with his own questionable methods. But all he really did was provide the mystery, and he wasn't even good at it. While the show made it look like he was proving Satoru's heroics were pointless; that some wannabe just can't bend the rules and change how things are, he was really just trying to get back at some guy screwing with his itinerary, like a griefer spazzing at some hacker barely worth his time. His vengeance against Satoru was hardly relatable with no background on how or why he became who he is. My only sympathies with the baddie is just him fighting an unfair fight, really. Anyone up against plot armor that thick is just asking for it.\\n\\n\r\nBecause of an unreasonable inclusion of wonky time travel mechanics, ERASED's characters become pieces rather than players. And with an aimless plot moving them like an amateur chess player, it becomes poorly planned and needlessly complicated. The characters appear so much more than who they really are. But in the end, it's like opening a bag of chips. All you get is air and a snack to pass the time.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 1\\n\\n\r\nTo those who still feel on-the-fence about this show. Yes, you're not the only one. \\n\\n\r\nNow get off that fence.\\n\\n\r\nIt doesn't take much for an anime to be great. Anyone can bash how the voices sound off, how cryptic the plot is, or how trashy the artstyle is, but no one can deny if a show is making the most out of its content. The most enjoyable shows to date have made it because of one core quality. \\n\\n\r\nThey were unapologetic; genuinely confident in what they wanted to say without making excuses, cutting corners, or pretending to be something they're not. \\n\\n\r\nOf course, you can leave it to subjectivity in determining how honest an anime is to you. But with ERASED, it always holds itself back, donning a mask of a supernatural sci-fi thriller to hype people up with edginess when its real heart lies in being a coming-of-age drama. Its most sincere moments appear in brief character interactions such as Satoru's inner thoughts on his situation, his conversations with his mother, and especially those with his new yet old friends. The humanity which made this show visceral and immersive is diluted in favor of a \"compelling plot\" to solve a \"complex mystery\" against an \"enigmatic enemy.\"\\n\\n\r\nIt's a pretentious show. And you can feel it just from how weak its foundations are; prioritizing shock, intrigue, and urgency before plot, world, and characters. It wants to be like the cool kids but doesn't know how they operate. The age of Steins;Gates, Madoka Magicas, and Fate Zeros are coming to an end because edgy shows today made the darkness meaningless. People suffering in a cruel world are nothing without the fundamentals: proper character buildup and worldbuilding. \\n\\n\r\nIf ERASED didn't deliver so many promises, it wouldn't have let me down this hard. A boring finish is one thing, but an ending that confirms just how shallow, undeveloped, and unlikable its features are nullifies the strongest of openings this show can offer. Except for you, Sachiko, you're still the best part of this show.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL - 5\\n\\n\r\nHere we have a prime example of a show that we can all learn from. ERASED teaches us how to fool an audience; how the combination of fast-paced thrills which appeal to the senses can blind people for only so long. Not only does ERASED do a fantastic job in first impressions and atmosphere, but it can also forcibly turn everything that it's worked so hard for into a sloppy showdown of deus ex machina-powered good vs. your garden variety evil.\\n\\n\r\nI've called this show so many things. So let me describe one more time what this show is to me.\\n\\n\r\nERASED.",

            "content": "This is a short and spoiler free review\r\nThis story is about a guy who has the ability of Revival, where he's able to jump/leap back in time (usually minutes or hours) to prevent something bad from happening. This ability is not in his control and his time leaps can happen anytime and anywhere. However, his world is turned upside down one day, where he's in a race against time to save the lives of the people closest to him.\r\nI went in with high expectations, and the first half did kind of make me happy. But the back and forth that happened in the anime mademe feel as if the writers weren't sure where to focus more (the then or the now), so they included both. \\n\\n\r\nI also found it hard to believe that a bunch of 10 year olds could be THIS smart and THIS independent. My mother would not have allowed me to go out without a guardian at 12 at night even when I was 25, so I was extremely surprised to see how chill one of the mothers was - letting her son hang out with his 10 year old friends at night with NO guardians, and how she wasn't the least bit worried when her son walked out of their house at 2 in the morning. Dude, what the F? It would have all been easier to believe if the children were 16 instead of 10. But, whatever.\\n\\n\r\nI was going to give it a 7, but the ending changed my mind. The villain's reasoning for murdering children was something unique, and I liked it. I also very much liked the ending. Not many endings leave me this satisfied.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, it's definitely worth a watch if you're tired of all the trash that the anime industry has been churning out lately.",

            "content": "WARNING: My review of this anime would not do it justice unless it contained 'spoilers'. The ending was too impactful for me to give it an honest review without talking about the ending, and as such, if you haven't seen the series and want the story to be a surprise, please do not read beyond this point. It's only 12 episodes so don't worry about wasting your time.\r\n'Boku dake ga Inai Machi', known better over here as 'ERASED' is a short, 12 episode series about a man going back in time to save a classmate of his from the past. The series gained a lotof popularity due to its impacting and weightful story. I was late watching this series, however, and despite the recommendations I only finished it today. And, despite how amazing the story and characters were in this anime, if I'm completely honest about my thoughts I have to say that I'm unhappy I ever watched it.\\n\\n\r\nDon't get me wrong: I recommend this series nonetheless. I thought, artistically, it was quite honestly outstanding. However the way the story ended ruined my outlook on the series. Up until the final couple episodes, I was enjoying the series greatly. The bond between Kayo and Satoru was genuinely heartwarming and the pacing let you really understand and relate to the characters. However, in the end, Satoru goes into a coma and comes out 15 years later. Kayo married one of his best friends and had a child with him. And, yet, the story carries on as if nothing happened. My biggest (actually, only) issue with this series is that they create this bond between Kayo and Satoru and then destroy it and pretend it never happened. The final episodes are devoid of the beautifully slow and elegent pacing from the previous episodes. They completely skip over the fact that all of this stuff happened during his coma. It's likely it'll be written of as 'they were children and so they weren't romantic, it's not a big deal that Kayo and Kenya married', but I don't believe this. Throughout Satoru's efforts to save Kayo, they develop a bond. It's clearly evident until the last time we see them together before the coma. And, yet, not even the characters seem to care. Satoru isn't even phased by the fact that she married his friend while he was in a coma. The show quickly wraps up in a half-assed attempt at continuing the pacing that the show had previously. It fails, quite horribly. I feel that, even if this ending was unchanged, splitting the final couple episodes into maybe 4 or even just 3 would've helped the ending a lot. As much as I'm unhappy that they threw away Kayo and Satoru's relationship, my main issue comes from how the pacing of the show was virtually ruined after Satoru comes out of the coma. It's as if they realised they only had a couple episodes left and they needed to cram in a lot for the ending so they just condensed it into a couple episodes and slapped it onto the end. It didn't work for me at all.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I'd recommend ERASED. Up until the final couple episodes, the show is genuinely very heartwarming, interesting and beautiful. I think that, as long as you don't get wrapped up in the relationship between Kayo and Satoru as I did, the ending works fine and, even if it's not everything it could've been, it certainly ended the series fine. So, if you haven't, go and watch ERASED. There's a good deal I didn't spoil that is very amazing to watch.",

A must watch indeed.\r\nMany fans were raged because there were changes from its original manga, but i am completely disagree with them. In my opinion, A-1 pictures and their director did an incredibly good job, given you have to deliver the whole story in just 12 episodes. Despite the changes, the essence of the story itself is unaltered much.  I think to do this anime justice, you'll need to watch it before reading its manga, and that is what I totallyrecommend you to do so.",

            "content": "This may be the first and last time I write a review based almost exclusively on the plot of an anime, but bear with me. This is not an entirely synoptic review, just a collection of my thoughts, praises and criticism (that is, one singular criticism).\r\nI absolutely fell in like with Boku Dake ga Inai Machi right off the bat, as I'm sure most people did (I remember, even if it was for a very short time, there was a little car for ERASED on the 2016 hype train). I watched weekly until the 7th episode, when I realized if I was left with anothercliff hanger I was going to lose my patience and literally jump off the cliff--so I caved and binge read the entire manga over the course of about 24 hours. \\n\r\nTo be entirely honest, I was a little disappointed by the ending of the manga. It felt so incomplete to me, in fact, that after finishing the anime a few months later I can't remember entirely what the original ending even was--only that is was dissatisfying, and in the moment I dismissed the show rather quickly with the expectation that it, too, would end up in disappointment.\\n\\n\r\nI AM REALLY GLAD THAT I DIDN'T PERMANENTLY DROP THIS SHOW. After finally sitting a friend down after a bit  of pleading earlier this year, I re-watched the first 5 episodes and realized that a few things were already altered (for the better) from the manga. Just a few hours ago, I decided I'd finish the series.\\n\\n\r\nMINOR* SPOILERS START HERE. \\n\r\nThe last 2 episodes, specifically, are what make the anime better than the manga. The entire show, we're rooting for Satoru to finally achieve what he desires--and unlike most shounen or even seinen out there, it isn't for some sort of self-improvement in the long run--it's exclusively to help and protect others, not himself. The direction that they take at the end of episode 11 and in episode 12 regarding Yumi emphasizes this point, while adding depth to the ending that was originally lacking. The ending itself is so much more optimistic and satisfying, creating a scenario of absolute success for Satoru without entirely pandering to predictability.\\n\\n\r\nMAJOR* SPOILERS START HERE.\\n\r\nMy favorite part(s) about the ending that differ from the manga is the addition of snow (yuki) and the paper airplane floating in the river (a symbol of courage, yuuki), along with a proper conclusion for each of Satoru's childhood friends, including the formerly suspected killer, Yuuki. This is also important when it comes to Kayo and her baby, since I don't recall it ever being stated in the manga that Kenya and Kayo get married--it leaves the father anonymous, making the audience feel as if it should have been Satoru instead, and that makes the entire coma fate seem worse than it really is designed to be.\\n\\n\r\nThe final cherry on top was the revelation that Satoru will be reunited with Airi, which I was afraid would never happen, given that it wasn't hinted at until the last possible moment. This reinforces the idea of \"hope\" and \"never giving up\" that brought the entire conclusion together.\\n\\n\r\nThe only complaint I have is the lack of Yashiro's character development, as it was explained thoroughly in the manga, allowing for a tiny bit of empathy from the audience instead of painting him entirely as a bad guy (despite the fact that he was a serial murderer).\\n\\n\r\nP.S. I'm sorry if my thoughts sound jumbled. It's nearly midnight, but I absolutely needed to write this review in the heat of the moment (take the bull by the horns) in order to capture all of my emotions regarding the ending of the show. In case I haven't already made it obvious enough,\\n\r\nWATCH. THIS. SHOW.\\n\r\nI highly recommend, it is definitely in my top 5 favorites.",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS HEAVY SPOILERS\r\n\tIf you have been following anime at all in the past year and a half, then chances are you are at least aware at Erased\u2019s existence. One of, if not the biggest anime of the past year, both in terms of popularity and reception, even being just outside in the top 50 highest rated anime of all time on MAL, and waf, for a time, in the top 10 highest rated anime on MAL, even being higher rated than such anime as Perfect Blue, Kill La Kill, and Samurai Champloo, all of which some of the best anime I\u2019ve ever watched.But, as someone with the most pretentious and elitist opinions on the internet, is Erased actually better than some of these incredible anime? Well, let\u2019s find out.\\n\\n\r\n\tErased is an anime about Satoru Fujinuma, a 29 year old manga artist with the special ability of \u201cRevival,\u201d an ability that takes him back in time a few minutes whenever something bad is about to happen nearby. But one day, Satoru walks back home to see his mother dead on the floor of his house, only to get framed as the one to kill her the moment the police arrive. Then the \u201cRevival\u201d ability sends him 18 years back in time to 1988 in order to prevent Kayo Hinazuki from being abducted and murdered as a child, as well as uncover just exactly who it was that killed her. The show very quickly throws in elements of domestic abuse, time travel, changing history, and more into the mix to change things up from your standard murder mystery affair. But, despite having many interesting elements in the show, Erased has many glaring issues that keep it from reaching its full potential.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe first major issue is how underdeveloped many elements of the show are. While Erased has plenty of cool ideas and concept, very few of them feel as if they were used to the best of their ability. For instance, the show has child abuse intertwined with its plot, but doesn\u2019t do much to comment on it or use it in an interesting way that makes it stand out from any other anime or film or TV series that has child abuse in it. It's just sort of\u2026 present in the narrative, floating there like a dead fish in a glass tank, while it is certainly there and is noticeable, it doesn\u2019t do much at all in terms of interesting concepts or ideas. Same with the idea of belief. Not in any god or religion, but the concept of believing in people and their motives. This is very briefly touched on when Airi has a conversation with Satoru under a bridge while dodging the cops, and revisited once more towards the end of the series in a brief flashback. But, other than being mentioned and briefly discussed, and the discussion really is nothing more than Airi stating her conflicting thoughts on believing in certain people and their motives, the show does barely anything to make this potentially philosophical and interesting concept, well, interesting. While I won\u2019t go into depth on any more concepts that aren\u2019t used well for the sake of brevity, it certainly applies to many other concepts and ideas used in the series.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe second major flaw in the series is the hit or miss characters, in terms of both development and in terms of quality. A lot of characters in Erased, despite being featured frequently, are extremely underdeveloped, such as Satoru\u2019s group of friends in the past. All of them beyond Kenya and Hinazuki get practically no development or characterization beyond a few archetypal traits, with some not even being blessed with the virtue of that. Then there are characters like Airi or Hinazuki\u2019s mother that, despite being important to the overall plot, don\u2019t get enough development and screentime to be memorable or interesting. Supposedly Airi gets more focus in the manga, which I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if that was the case considering how long the manga is compared to the short and sweet 12 episodes of the anime, but this isn\u2019t a review of the manga. Heck, Airi is barely even in the anime, she really only has about 4 or 5 short appearances across the entire series. And, before anyone tells me to go read the manga for better development, I will eventually, it's even on my MAL plan to read list, but again, this isn\u2019t a review of the manga. In terms of quality, some characters are likeable and interesting and a lot of others aren\u2019t. For instance, Satoru feels very flat and uninteresting, though slightly less so in his child form, whereas Satoru\u2019s mother is the GREATEST CHARACTER IN EXISTENCE. Seriously, all she does is make the plot less infuriating, make all the characters happier, cooks really well animated food, and generally just is best mom, 10/10, best character. Also, Hinazuki is good as well. But, none of the characters beyond Hinazuki or Sachiko are very likeable, interesting, or memorable. I mean, I guess Gaku is memorable for how bad of a villain he was AYO. But, overall, so many characters in Erased have little value to them, with little that makes any of them stand out as good, or even bad.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe third major flaw of Erased is the entire plot after Satoru saves Hinazuki, as to me, this is where the show ends. To me at least, the main draw to Erased is experiencing the story of Hinazuki and Satoru trying to save her life, which he successfully does 3/4ths of the way through the show. I didn\u2019t care who the murderer was, which it was obviously Gaku from the beginning anyway, I just wanted Hinazuki to be saved in the past, since she was the only character beyond Sachiko that I even barely cared about. After Gaku is revealed as the villain, and Satoru finds out, Gaku attempts to murder Satoru by locking him in the car they were driving, putting it in neutral, and putting the car in the water with Satoru still in it. Satoru inexplicably survives for no reason whatsoever and it cuts to 15 years later in 2003, where Satoru wakes up from his 15 year coma. Ok, first, how did he survive drowning to death locked in a car underwater, second, how did anyone find him in a somewhat remote location, third, why does Gaku have multiple cars to use and remove like throwaway reddit accounts, fourth, how did Satoru not notice it was a different car when he stepped in it, fifth, how did Satoru not notice how suspicious it was for Gaku to buckle his seatbelt, sixth, why did Gaku act so suspicious when Satoru saw his stash of candy in his car when he used it only as a smoking substitute, seventh, what was the point of having Gaku eat candy when it does nothing in terms of the plot, eighth, if they did have Gaku eat candy, why not have him use it as a method of abducting children in the park, at least it\u2019s something, ninth, why was this used as a red hearing as to Gaku being the kid killer, when he was the murderer anyway and AHHHHHHH. Anyway, back in 2003, we play catch up with all of Satoru\u2019s childhood friends, see him go through some basic rehab, then see him talking with Gaku, and once Gaku takes Satoru up to the roof to kill him for no real reason, again Gaku has no motivation in this series other than the blanket term \u201cplans\u201d, and then Satoru gets all of his memories of pre-coma back, I think, the way the scene takes place, it almost looks like he had his memories the whole time and just now revealed it, and right as Gaku is about to kill Satoru, they have some weird and oddly vague conversation about how Gaku needs Satoru to live? I don\u2019t know, it's stupid and it sucks, and then Gaku kills Satoru, but Kenya and the others set up Gaku this whole time to finally capture him, they do so, the end. What a mediocre ending. There is a brief epilogue and then Satoru meets Airi in this new timeline, which is ok I guess. Overall, the ending, and last fourth of the series in general is just really really bad, and not just in comparison with the first 3/4ths of the series. If your experience with the show was at all like mine during the first few episodes, you might as well stop watching after episode 9 or 10.\\n\\n\r\nBut despite those being all the major problems of the series, there are certainly a lot of more minor problems. For instance, a large amount of the symbolism in the show is really obvious and not very subtle, which takes away the entire point of symbolism. Time travel is shown with a loud sound effect and effect on the screen, violence and abuse is shown with the easily sean bruises or the color red, the universal color of blood and violence, and the villain is shown with his face in the shadows and creeping behind the characters. A lot of the child characters act like adults and like the have a great understanding of the world around them. Satoru\u2019s revival ability is extremely poorly explained and doesn\u2019t make much sense whatsoever. There are some smaller plot holes like Satoru purposefully triggering his revival ability or Sachiko\u2019s stab wound changing it\u2019s location when Satoru arrives at his house, or the fact that Satoru is constantly thinking out loud because he\u2019s bad at thinking apparently. Hinazuki\u2019s mother seems a little cartoonish and doesn\u2019t play enough of a role in the story to be much of a hateable villain, and Hinazuki herself feels a little more like an amalgamation of every character trait that makes you want to care about a character rather than a real, believable human being. There are some other minor problems, but those are all the notable ones.\\n\\n\r\n\tBut despite many, many problems, there is a lot of good things in Erased. Those first 9 episodes, minus the first episode, are really strong, and would probably be a solid 7 or 8 out of 10 if it was just that part of the show. The direction is pretty decent, with many scenes that look extremely filmlike and cinematic, in a good way, with plenty of cool shots, something very shocking coming from the director of Sword Art Online. The animation is\u2026 pretty good overall, but it's clear most of the effort in terms of animation went into the scenes in 1988 where Satoru is a child. There are certainly some bits that look worse than others, but it overall looks pretty good. Each episode ends in a cliffhanger that makes it easy to keep watching episode after episode when binge-watching, which is a positive for people who like that, I guess. Again, most of my enjoyment in Erased came from watching the plot of the first 8 or so episodes unfold, rather than from any other side elements to make it more memorable.\\n\\n\r\n\tOverall, I feel like for every element or idea or aspect in which Erased succeeds, there are 2 more elements that are either mediocre or straight up bad that ruin what would otherwise be a decent experience. Some characters are fine, but most are bad. Some plot points are fun, some are stupid and bad, some scenes are well animated, and others aren't. But, most importantly, very very few ideas and concepts feel like they are used to as much potential as they could have. Again, while I thought it was an overall enjoyable series, it has far too many issues in every aspect to be considered good or great. And because of all of this, I give Erased, a 5 out of 10. And thank you, for viewing.",

            "content": "Boku dake ga Inai Machi \r\nBoku dake ga inai Machi is nothing but short of a masterpiece.\r\nIt is to Anime what The Last of Us is to gaming or what Citizen Kane is to movies. It is thoroughly thought provoking, breathtakingly emotional and genuinely invested in telling a compelling story. \r\nStory: 10/10\r\nThe story revolves around the life of Satoru Fujinuuma, a 29 yearold pizza delivery boy that possesses a strange ability that he dubs \"Revival\".\r\nThis ability allows to him to travel 2-5 minutes back in time or rather is forced to go back in time every time something dangerous happens around him. Whenever this happenshe tries his best to avert whatever it is that's about to happen e.g. saving a baby from a truck being \\n\r\nWhen Satoru's mother is killed by a serial killer, he mistakenly ends up being targeted by the police as the perpetrator of the crime forcing him to go on the run. In the process, another episode of 'Revival\" ends up sending him 18 years back in time. He inadvertently ends up in his 11 year old body, back in his 6th grade class. Now sent back in time, Satoru strives to solve the mystery of the person who killed his mother before it's too late. In the first episode Satoru finds out the killer might be linked to several murders in the past that happened around the same time he is sent back to. In a harrowing journey through time, Satoru must now save his fellow classmate Kayo Hinazuki from being murdered, the first of many victims in a trail of dead bodies that eventually leads to his mothers death.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nAs expected from an Anime in 2016, the art is absolutely beautiful and clearly had a lot of effort put in it. \\n\r\nA large part of the series revolves around environments filled with snow and the artists do a wonderful job of animating it. The characters are amazingly well done, with each character design accurately representing their personality. \\n\r\nThe Anime makes clever use of butterflies to depict whenever a \"Revival\" is about to take place, as well as using filmstrips to depict timelines, with the strips changing or getting cut which serves as a well functioning plot device to help transition to different time periods. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nThe opening of Boku dake ga inai Machi has to be one of the best OPs I have ever heard. Performed by Asian Kung-Fu Generation, \"Re:Re:\" is right up there with the likes of Tokyo Ghouls \"Unravel\" and Parasytes \"Let Me Hear\".\\n\r\nThe OP really sets up the emotional tone of the Anime, perfectly harmonizing Satoru's internal struggle with the the several tragedies that happen in his life. \\n\r\nThe OST is vital to the story, contributing heavily to the very well done emotional set pieces. Happiness, sadness, anger, tension and suspense are all perfectly enamored with the music making for a breathtaking experience.\\n\r\nThe VA itself is also nothing short of amazing, giving each character a distinct personality and with conjunction to the the aforementioned character art makes for amazingly believable performances.\\n\r\nTake Satoru for example, his adult self is supposed to be a boring, mature and somewhat laid back guy and the VA does an excellent job on portraying that. Likewise his child self is the exact opposite, full of excitement, childlike and very energetic, and for his VA to portray that without making us forget that this is the same Satoru we know as an adult just really goes to show how much effort the the creators have put into making it.\\n\r\nThe ED performed by Sayuri, \"Sore wa Chiisana Hikari no Youna\" is indeed a beautiful piece of work that really manages to hit the viewer emotionally. The ED is especially exceptionally emotional during the 12th and final episode, playing over a scene of beautifully enacted sequences, bringing the end of the series to a very satisfying conclusion.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nThe Anime spends a lot of time building up the characters, trying hard to make sure we are fully invested in them and care for them and for the most part the anime does a good job in that aspect.\\n\r\nSatoru doesn't really come of as a likable character in the beginning but neither does he come off as unlikable either. To say the least, Satoru just feels like a very boring person, someone you'd most likely not want to hang out with. It's not to say he is completely dull and doesn't meet the requirements of what most of us come to expect from a protagonist, cause he certainly does posses some of those traits such as bravery, which he displays when he risks his life to prevent an accident from occurring which often results in him being hurt himself, thus also displaying courage. \\n\r\nAs a child Satoru is pretty much the epitome of a good protagonist. Brave, courageous, energetic and foremost caring and compassionate, this is displayed when Satoru stands up for Kayo when she is falsely accused of stealing the the class' field trip money.\\n\r\nHis relationship with Kayo is easily the best aspect of the series, which the series does an excellent job on building up towards. \\n\r\nKayo Hinazuki, is definitely the best character for me in the series. Kayo's personality, behavior and those tics she displays such as avoiding her gaze while talking really makes it hard to not like her as a character. However those aren't the things what makes her my favorite character. What does is the very character itself, Kayo is a deeply complicated and complex character for a child and that's what makes her so interesting to watch. Kayo is physically abused at home by her mother, is distant from people and doesn't really have any friends until Satoru comes into the fray. Being alone is something not most of us are comfortable with, let alone the very idea of being separated from the very reality we live in. \\n\r\nSachiko Fujinuma, Satoru's mother, is another great character. She has been portrayed as a very honest, caring and courageous mother with high willpower. She cooperates with his son in saving Hinazuki from her mother's abuse and nursed his son for 4 hours daily for 15 years which emphasizes mother's love.\\n\r\nApart from these three characters, Airi Katagiri (a coworker of Satoru in a pizza shop), Kobayashi Kenya (smartest childhood friend of Satoru) etc are a few people who get a little amount of screen time but are still likable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nThe idea of putting a supernatural ability like time travel is not a new one. I have seen Steins;Gate, Puella Magi Madoka Magica, Higurashi: When They Cry, Charlotte etc in which the character goes back in time to save his friend again and again. Erased, is actually different than all these titles above. It has a dominant mystery genre which is centered around realistic and old school mystery of serial abduction and murdering which makes it enjoyable. If you are into mystery and detective shows then this anime is pretty much recommended.\\n\r\nIn the initial episodes, the pacing was excellent. The show does an excellent job in creating suspense and leaves us wanting to know more. But in the second half, it starts to feel a little rush, but still it is able to maintain the the quality of it's genre.\\n\r\nErased maintains a good sense of humor which makes it fun to watch. For example, Satoru, in his young form, often speaks something out loud while thinking it which puts him into embarrassing or awkward situations.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nWhile Erased is a very enjoyable anime, it still is far from perfect. There are many things left untold, for example, the origin behind Satoru's ability 'Revival'. And it makes even lesser sense in the whole Erased world that Satoru is the only one having this ability. Infact this ability is the only thing which makes this anime a part of Supernatural genre.\\n\r\nMany realistic and thought provoking philosophical themes are offered by this anime. For example, mother's love for his child, child's love for his mother, frustrated parent's abuse on their child, loneliness in youth age, bullies in school, human's tendency to run away from problems, human's tendency to help other's in need, parent's situation whey their child is in a permanent bed rest for years, and I can go on and on. Regardless of the flaws or imperfections, the anime still manages to hit you right at your core and for that very reason it deserves a 10/10 for me. \\n\\n",

Sure, a couple of things could have been done better, and the main twist became pretty easy to decipher midway through, but it doesn't keep this from being one of the top shows from the recent seasons.\r\nThink a faster Steins;Gate.\r\nREVIEW BREAKDOWN:\r\nStory: 9 \r\nThe whole \"time\" paradox thing is definitely not unique, but Erased used it in a very interesting manner. What makes this show really great though is the pacing. It was perfect. A little loopholes here and there, and other scenes begfor a better explanation, but given what they had to work with, it was well done.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nFound the art and character designs charming, for the most part. My only qualm is the lip game going on with some of the characters. Lol.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nSet the mood and fit perfectly, but nothing too mind blowing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nNice cast of characters with a decent amount of character development. You'd hate the people you're supposed to hate and pity those you should. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10 \\n\r\nI couldn't stop watching. Need I say more?\\n\\n\r\nFINAL SCORE: 9\\n\\n",

            "content": "When I first saw a anime preview for winter 2016 I was kinda let down by the anime that started coming out, but one day I was bored and decided to watch the 1 episode of ERASED that came out that day and I was blown away. \r\nStory \r\n      WARNING TRIGGERS!! if you have triggers with depression and child abuse watch with discretion because these themes are very large in this anime. Though I liked how careful and respectful they were they also made sure to show the horror of the themes. The pacing is awesome with scenes staying atthe perfect length and not being dragged out. The only problem was the end. I was okay with the  end and I was very happy but the way they got to the ending felt lazy. \\n\\n\r\nSound and Presentation\\n\r\n      As for art it was different. It had a realistic look to but with also a anime look as well I wasn't the best looking anime out of winter but the animation was fluent and masterful. As for sound the casts voices were perfect and fit the character. The music was perfect fitting in all parts of the show but wasn't overflowing the anime. The music was haunting, beautiful, and magical all at the same time. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\n        The characters were interesting. some wormed the heart, broke the heart, interested me, and out scared the shit of me. Satoru was a interesting lead. In the beginning I thought he would be a usual flat lead, but turned into much more, he became a true and believable lost person that only wanted to save his friends. Kayo is also interesting with her seaming like a emotionless person becomes a broken person that puts up walls to protect herself because of her abuse. all characters are amazing in this show and are layered and interesting characters.\\n\\n\r\nFinal thoughts\\n\r\n        Though it has slight issues it's a dark and inserting time travel story with awesome characters, and good art and sound. I highly recommend this anime.",

            "content": "Holy shit this anime got a surprising amount of hate from as far as I've seen so Ima try to write something in the hopes that you guys will at least TRY OUT this show.\r\nSo, apparently in the anime community, boku dake ga inai machi aka Erased, is one of those animes that has only two sides to it. The \"best show ever side,\" and the \"worst anime ever side.\" Well to put simply, the side that loves it, and the sides that hate it. Very much so like SAO, and so you know before hand in case this review does seem biased, I ampersonally on the side that loved this show. But more so than that (this \"review\" is gonna end up into a rant watch), I feel as though some of the hate for this show is unwarranted.\\n\\n\r\nI saw a person post on here that he didn't like it because it didn't reach the amount of hype that everyone was giving it, but then again in that manner it has nothing to do with the story, but the bar you set for it. This show is by far one of the most unique shows I have seen, true, that statement does sound pretty biased. But look at all the other animes around you,\\n\\n\r\nWith all the \"B-BB-B-B--B-BAKA\" tsunderes out there, with all the screaming spiky haired shounen power up characters, with all the 5 girls wanting one dude's d*ck for no reason, and this is the show that was decided to be hate on cus it was simply over hyped? Admittedly, this show was hyped to shit, some might even say even more so than One Punch Man. But I don't know how anyone could ignore how great this show was, at the very least, compared to the other mundane dull and repetitive shows out there.\\n\\n\r\nLet me talk about this hype issue a little more, I feel as though one reason this show didn't \"meet its hype\" was because of how it was hyped. If you look back, all the shows that have been hyped are shows with a lot of energy, giving you a slight adrenaline rush (can you get an adrenaline rush from watching something? I think you can). Attack on Titan, Kill la Kill, One Punch Man, all of these shows were MEANT to get you pumped up and energized. So when a show like Erased comes out, where it's meant to get you engaged into the story and keep you on the edge of your seat rather than giving you that huge adrenaline rush. I can see how someone can be let down. So first and foremost, watch this show with a calm mind, calm as in don't let the hype get to you. \\n\\n\r\nNow that that's out of the way, lets get to the cons of this show. Admittedly now that that feeling of just watching an amazing anime went away, I can see it pretty clearly now. Ima start with the cons because I'm sure you've heard from plenty of other people on how \"amazing this show is.\" \\n\\n\r\nFirst and foremost, there are some conveniences in this show, and not ones you can easily ignore IF you are bothered by these minute flaws. I only call it minute because it is something most people can ignore. First, the kids in the story, one kid in particular is way too smart. If you have studied or even know a little bit about how a person grows, children are not capable of thinking in a certain way until they get older. For example, if you asked a kid the question \"would it be okay to steal medicine if it is meant to save your mother?\" Most kids would and should probably say something simple. But then you have this kid here, in fifth fucking grade, who's all like (if presented with the same question), \"Well, I don't think it's necessarily wrong to steal as long as it's for the sake of helping someone. Especially for someone as important as your mother, but you will need to take on the repercussions of your actions...\" You see what I mean? Like the fuck is this shit? No kid should be capable of thinking that way. \\n\\n\r\nAnother convenience this show has is how stupid everybody is. This person is framed for killing someone close to them, and the police don't second guess it at all, they just immediately think \"yep, that's definitely gotta be him no matter what!!!\" and tried to arrest him ON THE SPOT. WHAT!? You would think even the average person would be smarter than that. \\n\\n\r\nAnd last but not least, the last convenience I can think of from this show is the killer's motive to the whole dang thing. And actually, it's not that unreasonable. I'm not going to spoil too much, but basically, his reasons are simple, there is no deep complexion to it like obito from naruto or.... i dunno that's all I can think of. He just liked the thrill of killing, and this actually is not an \"inconvenience\" to the story, as there have been plenty of killers who are simply sadistic and psychotic. \\n\\n\r\nOkay, now that all the cons have been mentioned, lets talk about the good parts of this show.\\n\\n\r\nFirst and foremost, holy shit is this show unique. Especially coming from the perspective of someone who had watched all the mundane crap first, this show was a really nice breather. It's also intense right from the start, again, not the type of shounen intense, but the type of intense where the cogs and gears for the story are already revving up and moving full power. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of which, this show keeps you on the edge of your seat for the entire duration, part of the excitement of the show isn't actually solving who the killer is, but Satoru's (the MC's) struggle through all of these events. Like Okaba in steins;gate, the struggle that they had gone through is what made the shows interesting. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending to this story gives you a nice, clean, satisfied feeling too. You feel as though everything is wrapped up nicely, and that everything's all settled.  \\n\\n\r\noh, btw, in case you haven't noticed this \"review\" is very basic. It has no formality or proper structure, I'm just throwing out everything that comes to mind. So with that in mind;\\n\\n\r\nAnother good point of this story is that the story IS NOT, linear. What I mean by this is, there are struggles within the story, and everything doesn't go as planned, which causes conflict and rifts that in turn make the story more interesting and engaging. I remember one episode, my heart was literally beating harder than usual, not necessarily pounding, but just beating in anticipation. Oh, lemme show you, an example of a \"linear\" story would be something like, holy shit I wish I knew of an anime but I can't think of one. So hopefully you know of this one, do any of you happen to know a game called Devil May Cry? Not the original one, but the remade one made by a British studio or something like that. In that game, the story and objective was very linear, \"you need to defeat the demon king, in order to do that you need to do this this and this.\" And then you proceeded to do \"this this and this,\" and defeat the demon king and whoopie you beat the game. See how boring that is? If you look closely, most stories (good stories) are not as linear as that when there is an objective.\\n\\n\r\nStories purposefully have little things in them that causes struggle and conflict. For example, remember in Kill la Kill *stop reading this paragraph if you haven't seen Kill la Kill* how there was a bigger enemy rather than just defeating the student council president or whatever that title that black haired girl had? It's those things that \"don't go according to plan\" that make stories great.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways Erased has that too and it's really nice. It's an engaging show that doesn't waste any of your time, makes a nice concise and wrapped up story from the manga, and is absolutely enjoyable. At least give it a try.\\n\\n\r\nI'm tired as shit and I don't know who the fuck even has the time to read this and I'm probably not even going to revise it later lol bye bye!!",

            "content": "This is my first anime review, so please bear with my poor English. I usually didn't write any anime review, but this anime kinda \"force\" me to write it because it is too over rated. I will state the reasons one by one.\r\nStory-3\r\nBoku dake ga Inai Machi is about ......oh I am lazy to even write the main story, since this is an extremely popular anime in this season, I will skip explaining it. Long story short, this anime doesn't explain anything at all, like: why Satoru has that ability in the first place, Why the f*ck he can go back to past by shouting\"GO BACKKKKK!!!!!!\"\"??. Besides that, even though Satoru is an ADULT, he always acts like a child. When he saw his mother was killed and went to the past, he GOD DAMN put his priority at saving Kayo??! He just saw his beloved mother died in front of his eyes a few seconds ago!? \"Eh, I have go back to my childhood, ok, I will try to save a girl that i have only met a few times instead of saving my mother or at least go to see my mother that just been killed just now.\"\\n\r\nAnd who is the killer? Let me see......his teacher, and......one one else? The only reason I continue to see this anime is because i want to know the identity of the killer, but really? Only one suspect? I pretty much knew his teacher is the killer since episode 3, and there is absolutely no other suspect that can let me think \"who is the killer\".\\n\r\nThe thing that pissed me of the most is Satoru didn't tell anyone about his revival to anyone at all (exclude his teacher). I know this will be difficult to his mother or friends to believe, but Satoru did managed to save Kayo, this can be the best evidence to at least tell his mother or Kenya who are very smart. BUT NO, when he was trying to save Aya and other girl, he just said like detective game, instead of saying he came from the future.\\n\\n\r\nArt-6\\n\r\nThe only thing this anime is good at is art. But there are many scenes that they didn't put the animation colour quite well, like flash back. But the main reason I just put 6 mark is because they put the \"black bar\" to let you know that Satoru has went back to past, I personally think that those are unnecessary.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-2\\n\r\nLike I said in story section, Satoru acts like a child in the \"past\", but the conversation of all the kids are too \"adult\". Like, really, are they even children? Trying to solve crimes, saving people from child abuse. But more importantly, have you guys wondered when Satoru came to the \"past\", why his mother didn't noticed his personality changes? He \"suddenly\" become matured, try to save people, and his mother is like OH.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-5\\n\r\nThis story first few episodes let me wondered who is the killer, but after a few episodes I already knew the killer is that god damn teacher!!! The killer in episode one appearance, that black hair, those eyes, that face, that suit, is not like Jun at all.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-4\\n\r\nThis anime is over rated. I guarantee after final episode, the rating of this anime will dropped because of the weird ending.",

            "content": "ERASED is kind of like a cake that looks delicious on the outside, but when you bite into it its filling is dry and crumbly. It's still tasty enough though, so you finish it happily. \r\nCharacters (4/10) are the biggest issue with the show: The behaviors, personalities, and actions of characters are very far-fetched at times. I really, really hate when child characters aren't characterized as what they are - children. Satoru's childhood friend Kenya is a huge misstep in this show's realism - he behaves as emotionally intelligent as a full-grown adult, and is completely candid in his dialogue - it drew me outof the show at times and made me say, \"Really now? That's a ten year old?\".  Kayo as well is a bit too \"adult\" as well, child abuse aside, although she was a character I felt was likable and worked well enough for the show.  The other kids get plenty of screen-time, and are more realistic, but don't actually do much to advance the story other than simply existing. The villains in the show have completely shoehorned motivations, summarized essentially to - I want to do bad stuff because I am a bad person. That's not a motive you want in a mystery.\\n\\n\r\nArt/music (8.5/10): No complaints here. Great OP. Absolutely fantastic ED. The art feels appropriate for the genre, and the animation never seems jagged or low-budget. \\n\\n\r\nStory (6.5/10): Without trying to spoiler, the story is fairly engaging and manages to evoke sympathy out of the watcher nearly every episode. While the conclusion was very lackluster, and borderline cliche (the final showdown scene), the story will keep most people's attention and satisfy most throughout. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: If you're going to only watch one show from early 2016, it could be ERASED. The reception is overall good for this show for a reason: It's well-paced, it's evoking, and it has great art and music. That being said, it's going to draw you away sometimes with its lazy character writing, and it may not satisfy you completely with its ending. \\n\\n\r\nShould you watch Boku dake ga Inai Machi?: If you like a short mystery, if you like tear-jerkers, if you like time travel type stuff: Yes, go for it. It's a good watch.",

            "content": "Short-Review for those who just want Quick Overview: \r\nStory (8/10): Will hook anyone interested in crime-solving stories within 2 episodes, Very serious and emotional with the overall theme of child abuse but also about self-discovery. Otherwise It has really tremendous (especially visual) Storytelling (one of the reasons why it was so hyped). Don\u00b4t expect MC\u00b4s Time-Travel Power to be explained, it\u00b4s just a MacGuffin. The Ending is maybe not what you expected but again very well executed and will most likely leave you satisfied. \r\nCharacters(8/10): Every Character has a uniqe personality, zero stereotypes and the best Character Depth you could have within 12 episodes, althoughit could have been even better with one or two episodes more - Manga is recommended for this. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation(7/10)/Sound(6/10): Awesome OP/ED, good OST but with a few pieces too little. Nothing groundbreaking in the Animation Department, astonishing use of Colour and Cinematography. \\n\\n\r\nSummary:  As good as Anime gets within a 12 episode Series. If the you are touched by its serious theme, you will love it for the feels and will oversee some weak points through it\u00b4s great visual Storytelling. If you were looking for a murder mystery with a timetravel twist or heard of it as the best anime ever, you\u00b4ll most likely be dissapointed.  \\n\\n\r\nPersonally Opinion:  The Anime I enjoyed the most last Year. I got really emotionally attached to the characters, I cried, I cheered, I shouted - This is why I love Anime.",

            "content": "I find it hard to not talk about spoilers in a review like this, so be warned as there are spoilers ahead.\r\nAfter a year from my previous review for this one I have to admit...it's aged well.\r\nBoku dake ga Inai Machi is an anime about time-travel. Moreover it's an anime about a specific type of time travel known as \"revival.\" For an example, if someone is about to get hit by a car, said person could rewind time and go back to save them before they get hit. It's a basic premise that doesn't get a thorough explanation throughout the show, however I feel likean explanation isn't needed here. \\n\\n\r\nNow after so long I finally understand this anime and why people dislike it, as well as the controversy about the ending. Without spoiling too much, I feel as though the ending worked perfectly. It shows that Satoru had accomplished something that had been plaguing him his whole life. His entire life was always revolving around the murders of his friends and about the mysteries of the killer himself. And at the end it all works out in unison. Satoru becomes a successful manga artist and all of his friends and family members are safe. Sure, Hinazuki gets married to someone else but people miss the entire point of this anime when they bring that argument up. Satoru even said it himself, he just wanted to save Kayo and his friends. He was even willing to see her off. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end I must admit that I'm very impressed with my second viewing of this anime. The first time I was very bitter with the way it ended but I realize that this is because I lacked the understanding of what the entire anime was pointing at all along. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I loved this anime even more now than I ever have. And I highly suggest anyone who has watched this give it another go, it's worth it! And of course the OP was amazing, art and animation was smooth throughout and the enjoyment was great!",

            "content": "Note: I give NO ABSOLUTE SPOILERS. Just a few hints on the road so you can know what to expect;)\r\nSteins;Gate merged with Gillian Flynn's enigmatic grip to mystery, this lovely thrilling anime is definitely a must-go ride to all mystery seekers, detectives and curious time-travellers. \r\nEnjoyment - 10/10\r\nI try hard not to be biased nowadays, but if an anime has really struck me and I couldn't stop thinking about it, it deserves a perfect raw stroke. Amazing. \r\nIt's for everyone. But if you're really the type of a mystery lover and time-travel, this is the best one for you. I finished it in two days,since I was really caught up and the episodes are fewer.\\n\\n\r\nIt has a dramatic touch at the end. It's highly moral and good for everyone's viewing. It's not centralized on a selfish theme, for example how Death Note focuses on 'justice/thriller' and how Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso is on 'high school'. Because ERASED' anime expands. It is rich, because it's psychological and it can be understood by anyone. It is heartwarming. \\n\\n\r\nI'm probably only sounding melodramatic as a girl, but--BOY OR GIRL--watch it. Please. Or your greatest regret is not having to watch this anime, that when translated is: Boku dake ga Inai Machi = 'The Town Where Only I am Missing'\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOne thing you have to know about 'Boku dake ga Inai Machi' is that the first episode is already a hit. It cuts all the unnecessary introduction, like the usual anime entries--where the first AT LEAST 5 episodes feel tedious. In the first episode, Satoru, the main protagonist, is introduced as somewhat an apathetic character with a heavy heart as a manga artist, his publisher encouraging him to further 'dig up' to his heart. But Satoru is afraid to get into his mind, and so it continues...\\n\\n\r\nREVIVAL: an outlandish phenomenon that happens to Satoru. \\n\\n\r\nRevival will rewind 1 - 5 minutes time for Satoru; those precious minutes he must CORRECT SOMETHING or something negative will come out. For example, an old woman is about to die crossing the street--he should do whatever it takes to stop it. \\n\\n\r\nOnce upon a time, Sachiko, his mother came back. This time, Revival took a chunk on Satoru--because his mother was murdered. Yes, I'm talking about a serial killer on the loose. The truth is, he's been up abducting little children but hasn't been caught, because he always has someone to frame for his artwork. The killer is somebody Sachiko knows, but the story hasn't shed a single glitter of whom he may be. So, who is he? \\n\\n\r\nRevival will take Satoru on a deeper edge of his life, because the travel time isn't just in minutes, it's less than twenty years. From 2006 to 1988, Satorou carrying the mind of a 29-year-old will jump back to his ten-year-old body to prevent the past from ever happening. Save his mother, save the three children, and perhaps learn a thing or two that is certainly life-changing. \\n\\n\r\nErased, like Steins;Gate, the main protagonist must do everything in their might to go back to the past, and change the future into something new. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI've nothing to say about the art. I may just say that I'm kind of biased, since I've seen better ones. But it's good. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 7/10 (Composed by Yuki Kajiura)\\n\\n\r\nMusic overall makes an anime--my thoughts as a musician, music lover, otaku, story teller, writer, optimist, human. \\n\\n\r\nBut I may not have remembered an important tune that I eagerly wanted to search on Youtube. Anime Shiki, Shigatsu and Naruto all have their own brands of LSS songs that match with a depressing scene. Luckily there is an OST on Youtube consisting the songs, and there, somehow while playing--memories are back! Oh dear...\\n\\n\r\nBest track recommendations:\\n\r\n- There's something wrong \\n\\n\r\nEnglish subs are good. Nothing bad to say there, AS USUAL.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nBoy, oh boy, you'll love the killer when you find out. I have a say on this, it's from Fox's American Horror Story! :)\\n\\n\r\n\"The Devil is real. And he isn't the one with horns or a tail. He is beautiful, because he used to be God's favorite.\" \\n\\n\r\nSatorou's character is impressive and gawking. It answers to being psychologically dependent, because there's a scene where in the voicing contributes heavily to the role. A simple essay, written by these characters whose inner souls swim within the void, are--I guarantee--worth your time.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are humane. They're very analogous. Sachiko embodies what a mother should be. Kayo's mother shows that child abuse is true events nowadays. Kayo and Aya, are a symbol of people that couldn't showcase themselves or be well with others because of their rather different personalities that alienate them from the rest. Aya's a Shakespeare lover and a pianist, while Kayo is poor, and suffers from abuse in both physical and mental ways. \\n\\n\r\nDid I mention how KENYA resembles a much 'proper' figure of NEAR (Death Note)? They can read through the lines and their hypotheses are ALWAYS right. Spoiler: he's sooo beautiful and handsome in that suit fifteen years later...as a lawyer in the present & the future! \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe title speaks for its story. 'The Town Where Only I am Missing'. Very beautiful, compacted with mysteries, drama, psychological, slice of life. It's highly relatable. \\n\\n\r\nI like how the first episode begins with Satorou as a Mangaka. It's as if the author itself, Kei Sanbe, lets out the audience/readers on the life as a Mangga author: that it's not as easy as it looks, but you'll find your way. \\n\\n\r\nI like how it is revealed that Satorou is inspired by an anime named 'Hero' or was it something like that?? I like how it is attached to the world of mangga--anime, let alone.\\n\\n\r\nI like how the miscenscene has come. Everything--from storyboard to characters, dialogues and endings--feel so realistic and accountable. \\n\\n\r\nThe parts altogether are beautiful. I have nothing else negative to say in the matter. \\n\\n\r\nThe last ep will say something about having friends and until now it hasn't been ERASED!\\n\\n\r\nThis anime will teach you something you'll never forget! Promise;) \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Erased is a spectacular anime but I will say that it is not for everyone. The themes and topics discussed in this anime are special to me because it focuses on kids and the horrible things that happens to those who don't deserve it. \r\nStory: The story revolves around Satoru who possesses the ability of \"Revival\" which allows him to travel back in time to avoid tragedy. One of these times leads him to going back 18 years. He realizes that this is his chance to undo a horrible tragedy that occurred during his childhood, he wants to save a girl from being abducted. Thestory follows his adventure as he tries to fix the past.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: I will come out and say it right now, Satoru is a fantastic character. He doesn't have any real superpowers (lasers, super strength, speed), he's not the guy that has a cult following, and he's not super out there in regards to being loud and obnoxious. He is an extremely down to earth guy who just wants to fix things. The things that happen during the anime led me to believing that he is a true \"hero\". Another stand out is Kayo who is a reserved girl who is the center behind the disaster. Here story is truly spectacular. Satoru's mom also gets a mention for being literally the best mom ever. \\n\\n\r\nAtmosphere: This show does so many things right and hits every feeling spot on. When they want to make you cry, you cry. When they want to reveal something sinister, you feel chills. When the character's come out triumphant, you cheer. Even if you sense what's going on early in the show it is still worth it to stick around to the end because it is so worth it. \\n\\n\r\nProblems: Like I just stated it is possible to figure out what is happening before the end. That's all I'll say.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The show is fantastically directed and every scene has significance. Atmosphere and tone stems from being able to use imagery to emote feelings and the crew that worked on this did a fantastic job. There is a ton of really in-depth story telling done without any words being said and the art is the backbone. Well done.\\n\\n\r\nSound: As with art, music is essential to creating the proper atmosphere for any scene and the music delivered every time. Also, the opening and ending themes to this show are fantastic. The opening especially is sure to be one of your favorites.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: If you are looking for a mystery anime with great characters that ALSO has the ability to play with your emotions then Erased is right for you.",

The dub is also very good, and every voice brings lots of life to the characters.\r\nStory & Writing: 7/10\r\nCharacters: 7/10\r\nAnimation: 4.5/5\r\nSound: 4/5\r\nAvg: 7.5/10\r\nStory - While good, it is a bit disjointed and never really firmly defines or understands its own rules. That said, it still has a good amount of suspense and twists and turns, but the tone changes so often that it's hard to pindown. Unfortunately, it starts very strong and ends strangely. But still good overall.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - What seems initially like the best part, the characters are very likeable, and the mother is an anime MVP. However, other than Kayo, they are pretty one-layered. The show lacks *any* serious conflict with character values or purpose, and the friends seem to go along with everything easily, so it's as if they are there to simply propel the story to ep 12.\\n\\n\r\nI suggest it because it's easy, and the mystery is engaging. But don't go in expecting a masterpiece. Just enjoy the entertainment and the heart at its core.",

            "content": "This will be my first review so forgive me if I completely butcher this.\r\nSTORY:10/10\r\nBoku Dake Ga Inai Machi or in English; Erased, is a very interesting anime. It's like a roller coaster that's themed in a cave. There are twists and turns, and at some point a huge drop. You spend the rest of the time in the cave wondering where the next drop will be, but then the roller coaster leaves the cave and hits the next drop... But you saw it coming since it was no longer hidden by the cave. That's a very complicated metaphor way to put it. A really badone, but I'm sure you get what I mean.\\n\\n\r\nIt has you thinking this, and then it gives you that. Then when you were expecting that, it actually gives you this. One way to wrap up this anime nice and tightly would be to describe it as bittersweet. So many moments that made me feel many different things. This anime truly is a masterpiece. A masterpiece that wasn't such a masterpiece. It's hard to put into words. \\n\\n\r\nI'm gonna call this *SPOILERS* but I'm not so sure. Read at your own risk.\\n\r\nThe whole anime I describe as bittersweet because it takes the route just short of best. You're thinking \"Please let this happen\" and then your left with, \"well I guess that works too.\" This carries on throughout the entire anime.\\n\\n\r\n*spoiler ish end\\n\\n\r\nThe anime was also something different from what I normally see. It makes you sad, happy, angry. It was a really \"feely\" anime I thoroughly enjoyed despite not enjoying anime like that really in the first place. Maybe it's just me. It didn't take the route you think it would on most parts. Even if it would've made the anime better. It took it's own route that might've even made the story not as fulfilling. It had a Steins:Gate feel to it and that's the best I can describe it.\\n\\n\r\nAs for everything else,\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nI really did like the style and art of the anime, but it wasn't anything mind blowing. It fit with the anime and really did match the feeling of it all, but it wasn't necessarily unique. It did have it's moments though. Like lips, or eyes lol.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nNothing too AMAZING about the audio of this anime. There was actually a lack of sound, but I'd say that was perfect for the type of anime it is. Though, there also was a lot of sound. A lot of moments where ambience kicked in and really set the mood. Not to mention the amazing OP. I suggest you watch it. I highly suggest you watch it every single time. Or at least through episodes 9-12. (Adds to the mood)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\r\nThey weren't all that unique, that developed, or the greatest characters I've seen, but they fit into this anime like the last piece in a puzzle. The way the characters played into the anime was amazing. You get to see them in the light of Satoru the MC since we're following him through this experience and with such an incredible mc the side characters rise as well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10 \\n\r\nEnjoyment isn't the best way to put it, but I definitely loved this anime. It was a nice change of pace from the usual anime I watch and the ones being released now. I watched the whole series in a afternoon and it really made me regret putting it off for as long as I did. It's one I'd suggest to anyone.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nIt's not terribly unique or anything, and it doesn't always do what you like, but that doesn't stop it from being remarkable. Looking back at my review it seems really vague so I'll say it now. This anime is definitely worth watching. It's the type of anime that really makes you think. It touches upon a lot of real problems that we overlook daily, and one's we may not even see as a problem. For me especially, it made me question my introverted, solitary ways and values... Anyways, it's a feels road trip I'm really glad I took. Give it a chance if you have the spare time.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnime Score: An afternoon with vanilla ice-cream",

            "content": "Can I ask who made this garbage because honestly this anime is almost as comparable to being as bad as SWORD ART ONLINE, like you seriously must have fucked up which studio mades this?!?!?! (Finds out A-1 pictures made) Oh now it makes senses. \r\nStory: This show has an interesting hook to start with and I have to admit I was interested for about 5 episode but after that I have to say it got horrendously bad after that. The director was relying on the hook so much that he put no thought  into characters or the mystery element. I got so bored after5 episodes that it was like going through a 24 hour video and being forced to watch it and do nothing else, nothing cool or awesome happened since the main character is as smart as the adventure protagonist and not as smart as the protagonist he should be for a mystery genre. I got so annoyed with everything that happened with the story I was considering giving the show a one but I didn't for other reasons. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: I can't say much about the characters because all I know about them is their archetype and a little bit of backstory presented with them. They do some really stupid things but that's all I have to mention about them. Also I can't say I feel anything about the characters since their written horribly. \\n\\n\r\nArt: The graphics are pretty well done and the animation is above average. \\n\\n\r\nSound: The music is awesome and pretty enjoyable to listen to and the director did a great job fitting the soundtrack into scenarios to make the scene more intense. \\n\\n\r\nErased is just an awful mystery serious that has three major things that keep the 12-year olds liking the show, which are  the premises, art and music and that's it. (I apologize just in case you're above 12 and can recognize the flaws with this show.",

            "content": "Contains some spoilers.\r\nOkay so im writing a really short and first review of this anime.\r\nI was very fond of Kayo Hinazuki. She was mysterious and cold. Satoru Fujinuma's random timetravel that he didn't know could take him years back made it possible to save her from  murder. It was really entertaining watching him befriending her and seeing her soft side and take care of her pain. \r\nSatoru didn't have that much of a personality at first, but when he went back in time he gained some acceptable traits. \r\nThen episode 09 came to my birthday party... And he didn't even get an invitation!\r\nSatoru andKayo got somewhere in their realationship where I really thought that they really looked like a promising couple. Instead the stress of her moving away if she was taken away from her mom was not really addressed during the anime. I just felt like Kayo should get away from her mother and live with Satoru. Kayo's mom made up with her mother in a way that I think no one liked. We barely got to see Kayo's mother except for when she beat Kayo. It felt wrong to watch her getting emotionall with her past that we all of the sudden go to see.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the anime which the other victims other than Kayo just felt rushed and not thought through.\\n\r\nThere was no character built up for the other victims. I almost thought that it would be something good when they met Aya. But she just got introduced and shipped with one of Satoru's friends.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending was quite terrible too. The whole thing about rehab and such made sense but not the fact that Satoru even survived drowning and freezing to death.\\n\r\nThe thing that REALLY blew it for me was that Kayo was back and had a baby with the trap Hiromi Sugita. It made no sense for her to fall in love with him.\\n\r\nAt first I got really dissapointed. It feels like the reason of Kayos return was forced. It would've been less screwed if she waited 15 years for him. At least then she had a reason to see him. He also really did save her life, from her mom and from the killer. They were really good together, but that got thrown in the trash.\\n\\n\r\nThe last episodes of Boku dake ga Inai Machi felt like eating dry leftovers from two days ago.\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion, they should've focused on Kayo and Satoru's realationship. I have not read the manga so it might not be right to change it that much, but the manga might've suffered from the same problem.\\n\\n\r\nI don't have the patience to write a full review on this so ill just end with this:\\n\\n\r\nIt's really sad that they had to include Airi like that in the end. I guess it's just fate huh?\\n\r\nIt all went downhill when Kayo's part was over in the anime. They would've been better off making it a romance animeafter episode 08.\\n\\n\r\nThis had some great potential...\\n\\n\r\nOP/ED were great btw.\\n\\n\r\nI am giving this a 6 because of the first eight episodes. I honestly really enjoyed those. So I'd put a 8/10 on the first 8. But then I'd have to give the rest of the series a 3 for that choke of an ending and rushing the last victims stories.",

I will be reviewing all the slice of a life anime's i've seen so far, so don't mind adding me as a friend if you are just like me a big fan of slice of a life anime's and want to discover more> \r\nAllot people probably think. What if i could travel back in time? And change my mistake's. How would my life be then? Well this is actually that in a nutshell where the mc get's the chance to go back in timeand fix thing's in the past. \\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\r\nOhh yeahhh mystery! A classic who is the murder serie. I'm not a big fan of this. But somehow (after a friend forced me to watch) I decided to give it a shot. And man it was an amazing ride. I really loved the serie. It's been really well done. It had some interessting twitst's and unexpected situation's. I give this story a 9. Because it's really interessting. \\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nOke. I gave it a 6. Why? Well. I don't want to sound mean. But there's one thing that destroyed a little bit respect for the serie. i loved the style of how the characters are made. but the lips of the mother just made me laugh so hard that i had a struggle with taking this story serious. (Imagen pokemon being a horror movie) It doesn't fit. And idk. for the rest it was really well done and good detailed. It's just a stupid thing that the lip's destroyed it. \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nOh man. When the intro track came up i never skipped it. I just singed together with it. And the same as the outro. It just sound's good. The ost is also really well done. And really show's that is a mysterious story. Well done Erased! \\n\\n\r\nCharacters. \\n\r\nDespite the mother's lips *laugh's a little bit* The rest were really serious and gave me the feeling that this story isn't made for the younger viewer's. No childish play. And the characters were really adult. Even though some of them were only 8 year's old. I really liked that! \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nThe main driven thing that the story wanted to make you think was ''Who is the killer'' and i've been thinking by all characters could he / she do that ? Yes ? why No ? why ? And that is something they did really well. And i applause because of that. This is not just watching a serie. But also trying to think together with the mc. Take my 9 !! \\n\\n\r\nOverall \\n\r\nIf you like mysterious anime's. Where you find everything out in the end. Then yes. It's something you should watch. It's not childish and gave me a good time watching it. I give this anime a 9. And that's really special Even though i'm mostly positive about anime's :)",

For the first half the premise is just executed perfectly with a beautiful animation and even better plot development, a complete nailbitter suspense. Unfortunatedly the anime can't keep up with the excellence of his first half for the rest of his runtime. The key is the overxtension that sure shows big character and plot flaws as the time goes on, specially painfull to watch on the last third. The loss of pace, made by original but terrible plot turns, results in a weak and disappointing ending compared to the ashtonishing start. In short afailed masterpiece that every anime lover should watch at least for all the promise and power the first couples episodes have, showing that anime can be really something special.\\n\r\nPS: One of the best openings this reviewer has hear on years.",

The characters and some of the moments between them were amazing, and really made this show for me, especially the interactions between Satoru and Kayo.

These aren't necessarily bad qualities, but the show offers little else in the way of enjoyment.\r\nFirst off, the story was predictable. Despite every red herring thrown at me, I knew exactly who the villain was from the moment he first appeared. This is really bad for a show that's trying to present a mystery! Whilethe story does present one twist towards the end, that twist gives away exactly how the protagonist is going to try to defeat the villain in the end. And I was right on that too, though it wasn't hard considering how obvious Erased desperately tries to be. \\n\\n\r\nAnother issue with the show is its lack of consistency with its premise. The ability to return to the past with full memories is shown at first to be involuntary, which was alright at the start because he needs to figure out *why* he's back in the past whether it's two minutes ago or back to his childhood. The involuntary leaps alone were enough to build a great mystery around, but the writer then decides that it should just serve as plot convenience (as later events reveal he can just do whatever, whenever). There's no suspense or tension when the protagonist is pretty much in a zero-risk scenario most of the time.\\n\\n\r\nThe final nail in the coffin is how stupid the protagonist is. He has no redeeming traits, no plausible character arc, no redeeming value. His childhood friends are all absurdly intelligent for their age. The abuse victim doesn't behave like an abuse victim would in real life. A story is good when characters *feel* real, and not a single character in this show - except perhaps for the mother - meets the bar.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want a time travel gimmick with feels, watch Orange. If you want a time travel thriller, watch Steins;Gate. There's nothing worthwhile to look for in Erased.",

Every new episode everyone was like omfg, while I was like do I have a reason to care about these characters, besides wanting Satoru saving his Hinazuki and his badass mom.? It felt like they were trying too hard to make something popular, that was quick to grab an easy big amount of followers. \u2800\r\n\u2800The most obvious clich\u00e9 was animating Hinazuki's mother's eyes red, which is the most universal sign for evil. Later doing it toYashiro, making me question why what's the point in this.  And lines like \"this is my true form.\" Also \"In this the only one who knows the real you is me, so you can't live without me,\" please write better dialogue! I was also expecting the story to somewhat say something meaningful about abuse. But I guess I was asking for too much from this \"mystery\", maybe I'm just reading the wrong stuff. But I would've liked a theme to come out of this.\u2800\u2800\\n\r\n\u2800So the animation was average, and inconsistent sometimes just your regular A-1 style.\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\\n\r\n\u2800So the op & ed were both good probably one of the best of this season. I would never recommend this series it left absolutely no impact. I'm probably just beating this series too much, but I don't agree with it's praise.",

Let them live another day!\r\nERASED is essentially that sentiment in Anime form. \r\nIts an unconventional murder mystery, where our main protagonist is somehow granted the ability to go backin time to stop a series of tragic events from occurring. \\n\\n\r\nBut, its so much more than that. \\n\\n\r\nLove is the ultimate lesson in this Anime. \\n\\n\r\nIts about self-sacrifice: To make something of oneself; To care about someone else more than you've ever cared about yourself, and with no alternate motives. \\n\\n\r\nAnyone writing for Anime can, and should, learn a lot about the way to properly execute a manga to anime adaptation, as it was handled flawlessly. Here, we have a very short series, one that is able to compact YEARS of syndicated manga pages into an overwhelming and powerful short anime. \\n\\n\r\nI'm not sure how anyone could rate this as any less than a masterpiece in the medium of anime. It does what so many other anime have tried to do and fail: Tell a brilliant mystery, keep us in suspense, and all the while stay mature and relevant.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is also a masterclass in classic animation. I rarely uses blatant CGI or enhancements, and instead, relies on a near-Miyazaki level of attention to detail and illustrious illustration. \\n\\n\r\nFrom the character work, to the backgrounds, to the simple details, the animation here is near flawless and should be the standard to which modern day anime epics are executed. \\n\\n\r\nI only wish the anime world had works that even neared the quality and intensity of Erased. We live in a time when Anime is so commercialized, so lowbrow and churned out for profit, that we rarely see productions that feel genuine and truly loved by their creators. \\n\\n\r\nTo witness an anime of this caliber is to truly bask in the glory of the medium.",

(These two series are still very different so don't think this will be similar) However, there is one massive flaw in this series. If there was more explanation for everything the series would have been so much better. Many things were left unexplained that could have made the series a lot more interesting. This was the first time I ever found a show where the live action was betterin fact as everything was explained better in it. (I'm talking about the Netflix one) But let's not get into that because were talking about the anime, not the live action.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the other flaws found in this series is it is way too predictable, especially when it comes near the end. This show 'Erased' is all about the mystery behind who is the killer. When it comes close to the end, their hints are way too obvious and give it away instantly.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike other mystery shows, this one is a lot less suspenseful and tries to give more of a heartwarming experience throughout the show. (this doesn't mean it's never intense) This is done by not only focusing on the mystery of the murderer, but also focusing on him living his childhood once again and hanging out with all his old friends. It also does this through the romance between him and a girl he grew up with. This may sound creepy since he is technically so much older than her but the show did it in a way that made it a lot less creepy.\\n\\n\r\noverall score: 7/10.",

I will go straight to what I personally think and feel about the anime. \r\nMy biggest dissapointment in Erased is it's mystery genre/side. The anime showed us that Satoru's friend was the killer, but was only framed.So Satoru goes on and proves his innocence. But then the anime lost it when it no longer had any leads. Yes, Kayo's mother was abusing her but with the multiple clues that Satoru found, kept assumptions towards her further away and she no longer became a prime suspect. The anime couldn't just introduce us a random character to be the killer (if it did, it would ruin it completely), so this is where the mystery was quickly solved. We knew the killer had to be someone in the past but we were introduced to so little adults and through process of elimination, the killer was obviously Yashiro. It was so obvious that when it was revealed, I was not surprise at all and instead had an expression of -_-. Yashiro was also in every scene where kidnappings would occur, which also led to a car scene where Satoru finds candies in his car....basic kidnapping techniques. Later on Satoru was drowned and placed on a coma by Yashiro. And now we are closing in to the end. The ending was similar to 5 Centimeters per Second's ending as they were both realistic and the main \"ship\" didn't end up together. Kayo and Satoru had a connection but because of Satoru's coma, Kayo had to move and and find someone else, which was although dissapointing (in an enjoyment side), it was realistic because we can't expect her to wait that long. \\n\\n\r\nOverall the anime had amazing animation and story but the mystery and plot holes ruined Erased. The plot holes included the questions: \"How did Satoru gain his powers?\" , \"What was Yashiro's main motive for his killings, was it just pyschological?\". And finally, the reason why Yashiro just didn't kill Satoru while he was in a coma was stupid. Yashiro explained that he couldn't live without Satoru and I facepalmed all throught the anime at this point. It had a great start but halfway through the anime it went down and so much potential felt wasted. That was my review of Erased, thank you for reading. \\n",

Here you go, thank me later. Anyway, you are reading trough reviews  for two reasons only. Either you can't decide if you wanna watch it or wanna look up some opinions after you actually watched it. For the first group ofpeople I can recommend following: Watch it if you haven't consumed enough media so your bullshit resilience is higher or you are under like 16-17 yrs of age with mediocre intellect. In other cases there are plenty of way more worthwhile shows out there. If you are interested in reading my true and only right opinion on the show read the next paragraph. I am going to focus mostly on problems that i have with this show. There is no reason for words of praise for the good things, they should be automatic and considered as standard. \\n\\n\r\nThere are some things that I just have to put out there. Another time travel show with nice concept obliterated by negligence and Japanese Moe comform norms. OMG. Why do we have to be in a school setting, why not take the ideas and project them in some more interesting one? Why the childish characters are always the smart-asses and adults are just dumb background bush. What the fuck is wrong with some lips of female characters? I won't get answers ever i suppose, at least not the satisfactory ones.  The story is executed far from well, we have some nice moments building tension and climax, but very often resulting in expected outcomes. The time travel concept is mystery that is not working logically as well. There is nothing innovative nor interesting on this front. Whole story gave me \"well lets do it like this we have no time nor money to do it properly, even though we had few nice ideas\" feel. The show wants to be seinen and psychological? I don't feel it, not enough. Everyone lives happily after end was a big anticlimax for me. And what was with all of the happy kids running around wanting to be friends? This show wanted to be fucking Lucky Star and Monster hybrid? Certain setting and ideas just can't work together, especially in execution provided by mentioned show. Only mystery for me in this show  is the question how the heck did it become so popular. Secondly, only significant seinen element is the... wait there is none. Well lets move on. You might ask is this even review? I can answer you that if the show could not interest me or provide me with enjoyment am I expected to elaborate on the aspects of the show more even though there is nothing to be said. Sometimes the question is an answer. Art and Sound was OK. Characters... ooh boy, don't even let me start on this shit. Nice parade of \"unique\" characters to sum it up. I must say the show is not that bad it might be considered good thanks to an interesting time travel concept where the times goes back, but the mental state of traveling individual is the only unchanging aspect (adult in a child's body). The relationship of mother and teacher could be elaborated as well as the use of darker tones and mature elements in the murderous mysterious string was sketchy. The first story that has been just some pathetic foreshadowing was totally cut off from main arc not serving any higher purpose. Romance between some girls and main character could be involved. I could go on and on about many things but why? To sum it up this anime has some bright points, but fails in executing them. Doesn't even stick to its planned genre. Consists of many plot holes and conveniences. Golden shit is still a shit even if the production value is good.",

Characters were lovable, and it's funny that the kids (particularly Satoru, Kayo and Kenya) have these dope quotes that even adults don't say in real life (I know, I know, an adult made the manga). It's weird, but it's lovable. The protagonist's voice actors, although first timers in the scene of anime, they are really good when it comes in voicing Satoru.  \\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, the story was predictable. After episode 2, I just waited for the story to reveal who the killer was because I already knew who it was, and I didn't read the manga. It was obvious who it was, every antagonist in the series is this kind of person. There were some episodes that were... not as good as you think it would be, but it bounced back in the next episode. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment? This was one good ride. 2016 started right with this kind of series. OP and ED were really amazing, characters were great, story was predictable yet entertaining and the art style was good for a mystery series. Overall, ERASED is somehow anime of the season, but not mine. It was great, but not good enough. \\n\\n",

            "content": "***100% NON-SPOILER REVIEW***\r\n***100% UNDERSTANDABLE REVIEW***\r\nDamn the amount of hate towards this anime should be \"ERASED\". \r\nNow let me tell you about myself before this review, I am a keen-eyed person who does notice many, many flaws during watching particular anime, not because observing anime is good, but because sometimes you need to know an anime's flaws in order to really find out how much you have enjoyed it. Now, Boku Dake is an anime that has really struck me. Episodes 1 through 12 did have it's ups and downs. I believe an anime like this shouldn't be scored based off it's flaws, but rather bescored based off sheer enjoyment. Because one thing I find in other people is that they will enjoy and anime, and then suddenly rate it 2-3 scores below their enjoyment mark and start to pick out unnecessary flaws in them. Yeah it's true, whatever bothers you in a n anime will truly affect your own satisfaction over the anime but I highly doubt everyone who agrees to these\"4/10\" reviews rated it 4/10 on their anime list. You will find what throughout this review, I do point out things that are worth criticizing comparing to that of things that are supposed to be disregarded in this anime. And that's why this review was written.\\n\\n\r\nStarting off with the basis anime, a time-traveling man by the name of Satoru has the ability of \"revival\" which is far different than any other time-traveling anime we've seen. Now, I understand Revival did not get enough importance in this anime. That is one thing that could have improved in this. With it being 12 episodes, squeezing in an episode of information isn't wise. Revival is an ability Satoru can trigger when something \"harmful\" or something out of the ordinary is going to happen and he goes back in time to fix it. This ability kind of drags this anime along it's rides and events. At first, it didn't really hit anyone's mind that it didn't have any background information because A-1 Pictures definitely did a great job by hitting everyone with a master ending in each episode, and did I forget to mention suspense AKA CLIFFHANGER. I don't know about you guys but Cliffhangers, make me want to love and care about this anime more. Another thing related to this ability is the \"Butterfly Effect\". When Satoru is about to trigger the ability, a magical butterfly appears letting the viewers know, a bad-ass time travel is about to happen. \\n\r\nYes, the information on the time traveling wasn't the greatest and the most realistic, but it's safe to say we got a unique and well animated time travel.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the story about this time traveling anime.\\n\r\nBreaking down into pieces....\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nA truly bumpy ride we have gotten there. But with it finally being over, the story was really great overall.  Satoru is sent back ** years in time in order to save a classmate of his back in elementary school. Intriguing as it is, Boku Dake doesn't fail to justify it's work in how the layout of the story worked out. The first half of the series, (6/12 episodes) was truly a masterpiece. Then we start to get a little slow and somewhat unnecessary episodes that just hints the killer of the classmate. Not to mention, the reveal of the killer is something I really hated... This is what made me rate this anime 9/10. The last three episodes consisted of Character thoughts and less climactic development. In the end, I was satisfied, but I believe the main episodes were the first, and last few episodes which wasn't done correctly. Except for the first episode of course.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nSatoru Fujinima is our main character who really is a lovable characterespecially during his childhood times. His sense of humor is definitely something to keep in mind. With his mind being the place of his child body, there are many key humor content which gave the series an overall heartwarming feel even though is was revolved around murdering and crime casing.\\n\r\nSachiko Fujinima who supposedly won the fan award for \"Best mom 2016\" was justified in this anime. The mother of Satoru, who is a bad-ass mother who no one can really dislike, other than her fat lips.\\n\r\nHinazuki Kayo, the victim of this series who is presented very well. I likied how she was always the quiet girl and they way her case was presented( scars on skin) during school was magnificent. \\n\r\nFriends of Satoru all had a lot of screen-time which was great. \\n\r\nLastly, Yashiro Sensei, the teacher of the anime who is linked to every thing which is happening in this anime. Which I thought was a very bad way of approaching the climax of this story. All in all, he was a great character, who some have been made of as their favorite character of the series, because of his motives, actions and words.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I'm going to go ahead and say the Animation was done perfect, or at least close to perfect. I don't see anyone mentioning anything bad about the animation so I'm going to leave it here as a perfectly animated anime. Though some episodes felt a little different in terms of facial structure, it was done well for most of the part.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The OST, ED and OP were perfect and matched the anime, nothing more to say.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Now, with all of that in mind, that I enjoy this anime? Yes of course I did. Sure there was many things I hated in this anime but they were disregarded by the fact that everything else was well done. The characters, done well. Sound, well. Art, well. Story..Meh, it could've been presented much better. Now look, if every aspect of this anime was rated 10/10 and story 1/10, it would still hold up a rating of 8/10 with all the calculations being done. What does that say? You are criticizing this anime to a way new level. Saying, there was plot holes, cheap cliffhangers etc. All lies. Pure lies being typed onto your keyboards. There can't possibly be a an anime rated 9+ out of 10 on mal and have 4/10 reviews being the \"most helpful\", it doesn't make sense. If everyone agreed to that, then Boku dake would've been in the 1000's in rank. I'm just going to leave this here.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I loved this anime, in one aspect it is 10/10, and in the mind of a constructive criticizer, it would be rated a 9, or at the least 8.5/10. I thank you for taking the time to hear my rants and beliefs but I hope you enjoy this anime as much as I did!\\n",

            "content": "Storming through the ranks and into the top 10 of MAL, Boku Dake ga Inai Machi, or Erased, was a hit declared a 10/10 and determined to by AOTY just three episodes into the year by quite a few people. Erased follows a jaded, cynical manga artist who is working as a pizza deliveryman. Main character Satoru Fujinuma has the ability to travel back in time shortly to prevent the death of those around him. But after the murder of someone he knows he is sent back to his childhood. Now he has the opportunity to prevent the murder of his classmates in a previouslyunsolved murder case.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nErased has a lightning start, slugging the viewer in the face in episode one and leaving them wondering who the killer and what his past actions were. Initial episodes covered Satoru taking measures to protect the first victim from 18 years ago, Kayo. While this happens, information and hints are dropped regarding \"who dun it\" and the viewer is able to make a list of who's the most likely culprit early on. \\n\\n\r\nDissimilar from typical mysteries, Satoru actually makes little attempt to deal with the problem at it's source. Rather than searching the killer or masterminding a way to catch the person in the act, he takes a less proactive role as guardian protector of Kayo. And he tries to do the same for the next victim. This actually turns out to be an issue which he somehow doesn't realize. It puts a rather obvious neon lighted target on his back as the series progresses. Although the show does well to make you care for the outcome of the conflict and whether or not Kayo is saved, the big issue is that there's still a killer running about in town either way. This contributes to making the tension high at first, but it's troubling to see that the main character is not acting on the suspicion that he may be found by the killer. He see's the danger of the situation in a very narrow view. At no point considering this.\\n\\n\r\nWhile protecting Kayo, Satoru also must deal with her abusive parent. For the most part he does little wrong here at least at first. His actions can easily come off as strange to observers. His main friend Kenya notices this and wishes to get in on Satoru's plans to help Kayo. He plays it off as him just trying to help a potential friend. This is just a one event, but when the main character again seeks to help under the guise of making this a project of his to play hero, he further draws suspicion on himself.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nBeing a murder mystery, the story centers around the protagonist and his opponent. Unfortunately everyone else takes a back seat. Kayo is an abused child, who is beaten for a simple circular reason. His friends and mom and aren't too atypical. They're really just motivational helpers for the main character. One chocolaty back story proves to be an egregiously laughable motivation for what may have been a reasonable theme, showing what matters isn't just what you say, but how you say it.\\n\\n\r\nIf you do sacrifice the side characters then the main ones matter even more. Revival actually plays a big role in the characterization of Satoru because it tackles what was, or perhaps should've been, an important theme in the story involving his character. That was that second chances don't come often, so take them. Satoru is a character who's failing as a manga artist and working an entry level job entering his 30s. By all means he is not experiencing success. Revival gives him the second chance he needs, but he ultimately fails. Then he uses Revival again. Then he fails again. There's an inconsistency in theme here. Satoru gets multiple opportunities to finally get it right, ultimately lucking out because, well, he's the main character. It starts to feel reminiscent of a shonen anime where the protagonist wins against all odds because the situation wills it.\\n\\n\r\nAdd to that the hero theme that's built and often referenced in the anime. Satoru really starts to feel like an cartoony hero rather than a tangible human one. This is particularly poor given that the setting is real life, even if time travel is a mechanism used in the story. Satoru is built up as heroic and inspirational, but only slightly comes off as such. \\n\\n\r\nThe killer and his motivations were initially quite interesting. What drives him kill and how does he choose who? This comes down to a strange oversimplification that renders his interesting views just dumb. In fact his explained reasoning lacks consistency with all of his murders. Though it seems to finally explain why he chose his targets, it actually completely fails to do so. Erased isn't poor when it comes to character's but it is disappointingly average.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nErased was a decent show, but it didn't fall flat due to it's concluding episodes. The path was built up long before that. When looking at a broken bridge, the break is only one part to observe. The lack of proper support is just as important and Erased reflects that. Inconsistencies in the Revival concept would only lead downwards for the story, and the lack of depth for characters doesn't assist the story. Erased hurried through its best moments and slipped on its potential.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, the show may be largely remembered for claims of NTR and pedophilia though. \\n",

            "content": "Now with the rapid emergence of Erased being the most popular anime this winter season, there is massive hype and anti-hype surrounding it.  I'm really sad to see many people hate on it.  As someone who was not expecting much in the first episode that Thursday afternoon, I was blown away by the visual effects and the thrills I received from just the first episode.  It was breathtaking and refreshing how so much happened in one episode while not feeling rushed.  Now, here we are 11 episodes after that first take.  How did it end up?\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nThe story itself isgreat.  A manga artist struggling through life has this inexplicable power called Revival where he can go back in time to save others.  This power and a few tragic events trigger the story's unraveling and it gets epic really fast.   What puts Erased's story to a near 9 is its pacing and how compacted yet fleshed out it feels.  The anime manages to put a lot of information and crucial events in a mere 12 episodes.  Contrary to many series, the rushed segments feel less blatant and gross.  However, things like convenient powers and questions never explained become apparent that hurt the story's intriguing plot.  \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nThe art features some of the best directing I've ever seen in anime.  The visual effects are another level of well done style.  Effects like the film reel are used very well and often.  There is also interesting transitions from 2D to 3D landscapes to make some beautiful shots.  Characters look solid as well.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nGreat OP and ED to accompany a godlike soundtrack.  There is this one track that is charged with emotion.  It is so powerful to make bittersweet moments even more tear-jerking.  Simply great music.  \\n\\n\r\nVoice acting is also top notch with some interesting usage in plot.  When the adult Satoru and kid version both talk at the same time, it's honestly pretty mesmerizing.  It has a lasting effect on atmosphere and freezes the anime for just a few seconds.  Very unique I must say.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\r\nCharacters are where there is some room for improvement.  The protagonist, Satoru, is solid, but it is hard to find his definitive personality traits.  His thought process is decent and his actions are reasonable to an extent.  His personality is somewhat relatable as well.  Having a public mask for others is a common trait in our world.  Other than the main, the supporting cast is unexplored but good enough.  His group of friends is similar to Satoru without the inner thoughts of him.  What remains are masks.  We never really get the inner thoughts of them, but their characters eventually become more fleshed out near the end to remedy this.  A strong part about the characters is Kayo, a main female lead for a majority of the show.  Her story is depressing and her growth carries a large part of the show.  There is another female character, Airi, who has so much untapped potential.  She should have had a more important role in the scene.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment is where Erased shines.  Almost every episode has a massive cliffhanger and I've never felt so glued to a show.  Erased is a roller coaster of tearful emotion and unparalleled moments of super hype.  The presentation effects used to heighten the moments allows the show to be even better than it already manages to.  I felt so engrossed in the mystery and trying to figure out who the criminal would be.  In contrast to what others felt about the culprit, the anime played me.  I was somewhat surprised about how he was revealed.  Am I stupid regarding mystery?  Maybe.  However, regardless of how you find the reveal, Erased is a much bigger show than just who did the crime.  The anime's themes of domestic violence, regret, social personalities, etc. are very well done to deepen the experience.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I also enjoyed was the lack of fanservice.  Anime these days can sometimes be plagued with fanservice to ruin its serious mood, but Erased di not have any.  \\n\\n\r\nComedy was done well in my opinion.  I was laughing even between serious moments.  For some reason, this did not feel out of place like it normally would.  \\n\\n\r\nProblems with Erased:\\n\\n\r\nThe main problem is the convenience of the power Revival.  There are some things unexplained that leave plotholes always found in time travel stories.  This then leads to the meh ending.  The ending doesn't end up as bad as some people and it definitely provides a sense of closure.  However, something feels like it's missing still.\\n\\n\r\nThis does not hinder the anime too much and I would still highly recommend this anime to anyone liking time travel, amazing art direction, and sound.  Erased is a thrilling series packed with heartfelt emotion to make any viewer feel intense hype and genuine feels.\\n\\n\r\n9.4./10 it almost feels like a 10 tbh\\n",

            "content": "Let me tell you about A-1 Pictures. It's a studio that was established back in 2005 by Aniplex in order to oversee some of their productions, but eventually grew into its own big thing. And boy did it grow big, because every time I look at an anime chart, there's always three or four shows being made by them each season, and not a single one of them is good. They have some talented animators, but they have a tendency to put all their eggs into one basket whilst churning out a bunch of barely animated garbage in order to cover costs (or because they'reoblivious to the fact that churning out so many shows at once is never a good idea for your schedule). They have some neat concepts, but their desire to cater to the mainstream ends up causing them to spread the execution too thin to the point that their shows succeed at nothing. They're the studio that's most attached to the noitamina timeslot. And they're pretty much the main reason why that slot has lost all dignity.\\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, ever since 2015 became the year of the \"surprise hits\", I've been trying to keep a more open mind regarding studios and people that I've lambasted in the past as long as they're not adapting a light/visual novel. As such, whilst I had my reservations, I was willing to move on from A-1's last disastrous attempt at making a mystery anime for the noitamina slot as well as their entire resume in general given how ERASED looked a lot better in terms of source material, and directors seem to be a lot more motivated when they themselves think the source is good. At least, that's the only reason I can think of why this show looks so much better than either Silver Spoon or Sword Art Online. And it seemed that the rest of the world was just as willing to move on as well, because there is absolutely zero chance of ERASED getting dethroned from its current position as #1 anime of the year for better or worse. It's getting critically acclaimed everywhere in the community, it's one of the highest rated shows on MAL and APR, and most of all it's watchable - which is something I can't say for the majority of A-1's stuff.\\n\\n\r\nBut as is usual for A-1, this show tries too hard to cater to what the mainstream wants to the point that what should have been excellent ends up being \"not bad\" at best and \"downright ludicrous\" at worst. Here's the premise of this series in case you're one of the few anime fans that didn't jump in on this the moment it blew people away: a young man named Satoru with the ability to randomly travel through time and prevent deaths with it at times is suffering from regrets in life due to some people he knew being serial killer victims in elementary school. When his mother ends up getting killed by the same killer and he's framed for it (somehow), his powers end up sending him back in time to when he was still a kid and the victims were still alive. Determined to prevent their deaths and save his mother, Satoru decides to cut the killer off at the source by protecting his first victim, a little girl named Kayo Hinazuki. How does he choose to do this? By being the cutest little defender of justice that girl has ever seen of course.\\n\\n\r\nERASED's combination of time travel, mystery thriller, and school children trying to be adults has the unfortunate problem of being immediately comparable to the hit French video game, Life is Strange, and it doesn't help that it borrows some of Steins;Gate's execution as well even if it doesn't use its time travel premise quite the same way. Whilst the show isn't written by a visual novel author, it might as well have been, because it's pretty much a melodramatic \"save the girl\" story under the pretense of a thriller. You have your male lead who doesn't have much of a personality and does whatever the plot requires him to do. You've got a lot of exposition. You've got multiple girls he needs to save - including one trap - but he only focuses on one at a time. You've got time-travel. You've got multiple set pieces that don't come together very well. Really, the only thing it doesn't have in common with a visual novel adaptation is the fact that it actually has decent pacing for the most part. Kudos to the director since his previous stuff moved slower than a mule carrying Paul Bunyan up a canyon.\\n\\n\r\nWhere it differs from Steins;Gate and more into Life is Strange territory is that the story treats the time travel thing as an unexplained thing the protagonist actually has because it's ultimately nothing more than a convenient plot device to get on with the real story, and it goes even further in that it's never brought up in the narrative at all after the first episode. However, whilst Life is Strange tackled multiple aspects of what it means to be a teenager through Max's dramatics attempts to save her friend Chloe whilst outwitting a serial killer and averting a giant tornado that threatens to wreck her town, ERASED doesn't have much to support its drama other than raw emotion. Although the plot involves Satoru saving the victims of a serial killer because somehow that'll keep his mother alive in his own timeline on paper, in reality, large sections of the series are devoted towards the twenty-something year old stuck in an elementary-school body getting friendly with one of the girls whilst the others are mostly just an afterthought. And to make matters worse, there's nothing much to draw from the relationship between the two besides acknowledging that parental abuse exists and it's hard to gain support to avert it - which wasn't even really an intriguing story when Higurashi did it ten years ago.\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair, I did enjoy the relationship parts quite a bit because they did a decent job of capturing what it means to be young and in love, even if they weren't doing anything all that interesting with it. But mostly, I liked them because they were a hell of a lot better than the actual mystery elements. Now in Life is Strange, the mystery/time travel stuff were kind of meh, especially next to all the teenage social issue stuff. But they were definitely easier to swallow than ERASED's thriller elements, which are so by-the-books and so divorced from the majority of the show that you can see the writer struggling to mesh the two in the background before giving up altogether after Kayo's arc ends.\\n\\n\r\nFor starters, it is incredibly obvious who the killer is by the halfway point - not helped by the fact that the credits show he has the same voice actor as a major established character - and yet the show persists on dragging the reveal out for another few episodes. Secondly, by the time it comes to reveal the dude, there's only one possible suspect it could be and no amount of denial from Satoru's side of things change the fact that the foreshadowing was so obvious the guy might as well have been wearing a T-shirt saying \"I am the murderer\" the entire time. Whilst I was spoiled the identity of the murderer in Life is Strange beforehand, at least the game had the decency to distract us from figuring out his identity with genuine red herrings. And whilst they both turned kind of cartoon-y upon the reveal, ERASED really overdoes the theatrics in regards to him - and that's saying a lot considering the show's overall direction is about as unsubtle as a giant dog playing bagpipes in the middle of an ice-skating competition.\\n\\n\r\nNow both series do have things that happen after the reveal of the murderer, and this is where ERASED really falls apart by comparison. Of course, Life is Strange's ending is controversial in of itself and I stand by that the decision to let Tampa Bay die should have been excluded from the narrative entirely, but you can't deny that both final choices focus on the characterization and how the chase affected Max. ERASED decides to give closure to the characters that Satoru grew up with, which is fine in of itself, but then it tries to give closure to Satoru and that's when you realize that he never had a character arc. He never had any interesting flaws. His time-travel powers are so arbitrary they might as well not exist, despite needing to in order for the plot to work. So even if you ignore how silly the final confrontation is by nature, Satoru just isn't strong enough to support his end of the bargain, nor the epilogue where he makes it big in the manga world. I understand he's supposed to be a guy who inspires others to develop, but when he's left to carry things on his own, he's basically as interesting as Robert Zemeckis' current career.\\n\\n\r\nIf ERASED had ditched all of its mystery thriller aspects and just been a story about a guy trapped in the past falling in love with a girl he knew long ago, only to lose her again and moving on from his life after realizing that changing the past is just not feasible, this show might have been the Shinkai-esque series I'd really support. If it had actually tackled mature topics in a morally ambiguous way through its EMOTIONAL moments and lackluster thriller elements, it might have been the anime equivalent of Life is Strange except more \"visual novel-y\". If its main character wasn't such a reactionary putz who does whatever is most dramatic according to the convenience of the plot, I might have had as much hope for the show's future as everyone else did when that first episode aired. Seriously guys, the premiere was fine, but I don't understand what puts it on the same level as the premieres to either of Shinichiro Watanabe's noitamina anime or Ping Pong or The Tatami Galaxy. Last I remembered, it was mostly prettily-told exposition that set up the concepts and plot, but didn't establish what the actual story would be about, nor did it do a satisfactory job of making the main lead interesting.\\n\\n\r\nSo, final grade?\\n\\n\r\nAverage.",

            "content": "Ah right! Soon as I finished this Boku Dake I knew I had to write a review. \r\nStory: It wasn't the first time I've seen a time travel series or animation. Prior to a time travel series I've already seen The Girl Who Leapt Through Time, but Boku Dake the anime was something new. Satrou is our main character and it just so happens he has a power called \"revival\", and this in turns lets him save lives by going back between 1 and 5 minutes. So the meat of the story comes in when Satoru is confronted with the murder of his mom andthe past of Hinazuki, Kayo- a mysterious girl from his past.\\n\\n\r\nArt: It was done fairly well so to say. The art is in Boku Dake is very refreshing and provides a new structure in usual japanese animation. One particular thing that stood out in Boku Dake is how it uses a specific color to describe the feeling of death. \"Red\" is almost always apparent and appears on all characters suspect of being a fugitive in the murder. The art also brings along a sort of nostalgic art or feel when we see Satoru recollect image of his past like a puzzle. Well done!!\\n\\n\r\nSound: Please listen to the opening... even if you don't like music the director has a way of making it work, as well as background music- to the ed of each episode making dread the sadness of Hinazuki's death. Complements to the music creators and their influence in making Boku Dake even more entrancing. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters for me were unique and presented at a nice pace. I felt Satoru had a nice character development, as he came from a character who didn't thing that being a \"hero\", was possible as long as it was him. The story's quite beautiful and the characters that with it. On another positive note I also really really like Airi's character as she's no so much a character but a real person. Airi may not be a main character but I would love to see an OVA with her as a main character. Yeah I'm bias on that because we have Kayo fans as well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: It'll be on my top favorite animes to watch that's for sure. From the story telling to the music and animation Boku Dake never fails to exceed my expectation. Even if there were times where I wanted not to cringe because of how cheesy a moment feels it's something special with each episode. This anime not only lets you relive your best moments or your I-don't-want-to-remember-moment with Satoru- expect in this case he gets a chance to change. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: Judging by the ending of the anime Winter season, I'll have to find something new to look foward to. I'll only say this and that's get started on this anime RIGHT NOW!!!! Like I'm seriously sad if you won't check it out. Watch for one thing- that is the characters.... if Satoru is a real person I'd give him a hug for his bravery and kindness right now.",

            "content": "I figured for this particular anime, I\u2019d change my usual layout a bit differently.  \r\nAnime comes and go, but every once in a while a particular exciting show comes along with a strong premise and a very promising story. \r\nIn the past these shows can be Future diary and SAO for example. In the case of Boku Dake ga Inai Machi or \u2018Erased\u2019 in its English title it falls more in to the category of what Future diary did. \r\nWe have our main protagonist Satoru Fujinuma who is a 29-year old delivery man. Satoru feels responsible for not being able to prevent the deathsof three classmates and even after 18 years have passed Satoru still feels the after-effects of the events that took place. \\n\\n\r\nI have to say I don\u2019t particularly like Satoru\u2019s character. What Satoru needed to realize was the fact that Satoru didn\u2019t befriend Kayo Hinazuki when they were younger didn\u2019t have any real effect on her death or not. The anime even goes to show that in the first \u2018Revival\u2019 \\n\\n\r\nWhen you\u2019re an 11 year old, there was no real way in being able to stop the murder as I\u2019m sure the killer has the victim in his sights the whole time. Even if they were friends or not, the outcome would be the same and the fact that Satoru went unnecessarily out of his way to stop deaths from happening almost cost him his own life. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I hated the most (and this applies to a lot of situations that happen in real life) is that he ran away from the police after they suspect Satoru of murder. Surely the police would know that Satoru hadn\u2019t killed said person after he just came home from work. Surely Satoru would have alibies and surely the police would actually have found the killer if Satoru hadn\u2019t BLOODY RUN AWAY!!\\n\\n\r\nThe ending for Erased also being similar to Future diary ended in an unsatisfactory way. Satoru changes the timeline and the fact that Satoru completely justifies his actions in changing the past as the correct choice is quite arrogant. Surely if I had the ability to go back in time, I\u2019d be betting on the scores of games or getting the winning lottery tickets, but hey! Why not save a few kids who may or may not end up being future serial killers themselves right? \\n\\n\\n\r\nIt all comes down to the fact that if you go back and kill someone it may not change things for the better and if you save someone things also may not change for the better as a greater evil may take its place.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I\u2019m focusing heavily on the negatives, I still found Erased to be a very good show. I felt that a loss of direction stopped this from being a truly great anime and I feel with this anime it ended up being what Future diary and SAO had become. Characters like Kenya were particularly mature for the most part and does evoke suspicion because of that. While Satoru has the best intentions despite his flaws so I can\u2019t fault him on that. Satoru also did a good job of challenging the killer with his limited knowledge of the past events. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound for the show was great and I particularly enjoyed the opening song and the animation behind it. Character designs were a bit different from what I\u2019m used to seeing, so it was fresh.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall I did enjoy Erased. Despite the lack of direction the anime had I felt that the story and the characters carried the show best throughout the middle. Erased is by no means a bad show, for me it just didn\u2019t fulfil its full potential. \\n\\n\r\nI give Boku Dake ga Inai Machi a 7 out of 10 and a recommendation to watch this series. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading guys. Have a nice day!\\n",

            "content": "First of all I just wan't to say that the only reason I felt the need to write this review was because I witnessed the cancerous users who felt the need to give it ratings such as 1 and 3 and 4 for the most idiotic reasons like \"oh they showed child abuse thats disgusting 0/10\" or \"oh time travel, a bunch of shows have done this give me something different.\" The people writing these reviews clearly have no patience and decide to review something without fully absorbing all it has to offer. People have also complained that the whole time travel thing wasn't explained,but IT ISN'T SUPPOSED TO BE. The actual time travel isn't the plot focus, it's the mystery of the murder and the OC's past. The people writing bad reviews clearly aren't knowledgeable enough to be giving this show so much shit that it doesn't deserve. So I really just wrote this to boost the show's score cause it doesn't deserve the hate that it gets. Below is a copypasta of a review on a blog I did for school.\\n\\n\r\nSo the song used in ERASED is actually six years old, but a studio recording was probably made just for the show. I think that there couldn't have been a better song picked for this show. It really is such a great match for the themes presented. The way Asian Kung-Fu Generation's song are, almost force the listener to reflect on themselves and make a change. In Naruto, the main character tries to go against everyone's judgement on him being a cursed child and tries to become a hero. In ERASED however, the main character is shown as someone struggling with making something out of his life in his late 20's. Now this is an extremely important part of the plot which revolves around him fixing a part of his past which will in turn change him into a better person.\\n\r\nThe main character's occupation is shown as a manga artist who's in need of good inspiration while working part time at a pizza place to cover for his expenses. It's assumed from the beginning that him going back in time and changing this important part of his life will be what he will illustrate in a manga. This is used as a means of breaking the fourth wall and making the story feel incredibly realistic. Aside from the great plot setting, I can't help but admire how great the directing is. It's not something you can easily notice without watching a large number of anime but the directing of this show was seriously superb. It felt like all of the events occurred with great timing, the plot moves a bit slow but the director knew which parts he shouldn't dwell on for too long. The pace is one that only exists in the most critically acclaimed shows which shows that this show really does have great potential. After listening to a podcast of a group of people reviewing the shows of this season, I found that we shared the same insights on ERASED. On a side note, most of the show will occur in the environment of middle school children. I don't know if adults will feel this more than a highschooler would, but I feel extremely nostalgic when being exposed to such an environment. I don't hate it; in fact I think it's a great element to the show and makes it extremely relatable to any viewer.\\n\r\nTo wrap this up I'm going to explain the emotional aspect of this show. I've watched countless shows that have made others cry, and I have never once cried. Although I didn't cry to ERASED, I come very close to breaking into tears every time I hear the opening song. I also nearly cried when a certain character died, and when an emotional event occurred in episode three. I have never come that close to crying for any other show, and I can already tell by now that sometime soon I will cry. As for the ending of the show, I know that there's no way I can help myself from crying. Some people might say, \"Why would I want to watch something that'll make me cry?\" in a defiant tone. What a few people don't understand is that experiencing sadness really lets us think. People these days generally seek pleasure and well, more importantly a good and stable job. Not many people slow down and really reflect on the world and their surroundings in general. For this reason, people really shouldn't stray away from reading or watching depressing things, they help us grow and they're a part of living. Life can't only be filled with happiness because without sadness, we wouldn't know what happiness really is.",

Around a 6 it deserves.\r\n(May Contain Spoilers)\r\nNow The Characters,Satourou Fujinuma who was the main Character in this anime and along with it he had a power called Revival. it would send him back in time when someone was close to dying or was dead.He was a boring character for sure at the start. But when it progresses more into the anime his personality changes. now Satorou's Mother was a great character as well as she mixed in helping Satarou save his friends. All the rest of characters were just standbys didin't get much time on screen. For characters I would rate a 7.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime very much,This Possibly deserves to go into the top 10 of MAL.My Enjoyment rating is a 9.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I Loved this Anime Along with its story, it's art and its Characters were just Amazing Its a really great anime for those who like Dramatic,Mystery and Heart Moving Anime.\\n\r\nThis anime definitely deserves a 10 overall. This is yet one of the best anime of watched yet and I want a second season but that doesen't really seem possible.\\n\r\nThe Intro music is nice as well it goes with what's happening in the intro music.\\n\r\nIf possible I would really love a second season or an anime related to it. \\n\\n\\n",
