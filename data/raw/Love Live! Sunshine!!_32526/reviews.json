            "content": "Love Live Sunshine is the successor to the popular Love Live, which recently ended with a movie. This continuation to the series really got me excited, since love live is one those anime that I don\u2019t get tired or re-watching (I probably re-watch it twice a year or so.) and also at some point I religiously played the mobile game every single day. But still, in the end, little by little I got disappointed of the show throughout the season. Spoilers ahead for those who haven't finish them yet.\r\nThe dialogue of the characters isn\u2019t well thought out. It\u2019s basically them spouting memes non-stop hoping thatsome of them will stick as much as the infamous nico nico nii. Seriously,Hanamaru went from somewhat shy bookworm to just simply saying zura and mirai most of her dialogue. There\u2019s also the part where she\u2019s just stuffing her face with the noppo bread in the background most of the time just to fill the advertisement quota. \\n\\n\r\nThe way they recruit their members feels forced, this got painful for me to watch when Yoshiko joined in specific. The setting is somewhat a rehash to the first LL the way I see it. There\u2019s too many to point out but the point is that they basically just used the same plot points, which seems like lazy writing. The only part where it felt original was the third year drama.\\n\\n\r\nThe most annoying part that really irked me is the constant mention of \u03bc\u2019s. I feel like they mention them too much, mentioning them a few times is okay and all but mentioning them literally all episodes except the last one is a little bit too much.\\n\\n\r\nShould you watch it because you\u2019re a Love Live fan? Sure why not. Overall it\u2019s not that bad of a show, I still enjoyed watching it on time every week, but I felt like they could do better, since the characters and the songs are pretty solid. But I guess to me this feels like more a last minute cashgrab to pander to the hardcore love live fans.\\n",

            "content": "I had very mixed feelings when I heard Love Live would be starting again with a new cast of characters. Muse had finally gotten to the point where each member had earned their place, and while it made sense for their story to end, I always felt a desire for more. I wanted it to be the beginning rather than the ending. \r\nLove Live Sunshine may not have been the beginning I wanted, but it is hardly a weak addition to the series. It does many of the things that made the original series so special, and more than justifies its own existence. I'm gladit exists, and am without any doubt looking forward to seeing more of Aquors.\\n\\n\r\nBut Sunshine isn't without issues. It follows the footprints of the original series a bit too closely-- the flaws and missteps of its first half included and ever more so apparent.\\n\\n\r\nSunshine, like the first season of the original, moves too fast and swims a bit too deep in the drama, rather than giving the audience the main thing they are looking for: reason to like and care for the girls. It sets a nice stage for the inevitable second season, but at the same time, it's hard to not feel a little bit bummed out when Sunshine starts with the same stumbles rather than learning from the original's excellent second season. If it sounds like I am being a harsh critic, you may be right, but part of that is because I have a strong attachment to the original series and want to see its successor reach the same highs. If it can't, wouldn't it be reasonable to lament that there is not just more Muse instead?\\n\\n\r\nSunshine actually does a pretty admirable job with its drama. It never aims to be something more or different from what it truly is, and what is there is handled with meaning and clarity-- even if its themes are something we have heard a hundred times before-- and its bittersweet and well-timed background music consistently amplifies its message. Sunshine's heart is in the right place. The problem is just that there is just too much of this drama, too soon. Assuming there is to be more of Aquors (and I will bet my non-existent heart that there will be), the climax of their story is not now, but then. This isn't the time to bring them on the big stage, but to prepare them for it. They aren't ready, and neither is their audience.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Nico's \"Nico Nico-nii\" catchphrase was silly (and adorable), the original series did not ever attempt to paint that as a genuine part of her character; it was a joke even to herself, and entirely contrary to her personality. Yoshiko, and to a lesser extent, Mari and Hanamaru, are defined to varying extents by these sorts of catchphrases, without the same sort of depth or rationale to it that Nico's character had. Some may find Yoshiko's terminal autism to be amusing (and indeed it can be!), but these sorts of gimmicks do little else but make them feel somewhat artificial, at times even empty. And empty is the last thing a character from Love Live should be.\\n\\n\r\nBut nine main characters is a lot to deal with in only thirteen episodes. The original series had yet to accomplish the same by that point, so, I suppose, it is only fair to expect Sunshine will also start hitting those strides from here on. Most of the girls (particularly Ruby) are cute and interesting enough in their own right, even if they have done little yet to stand out from the more outgoing characters. I'm just worried that Sunshine has turned Yoshiko into such a joke that there may be no way of ever doing anything meaningful with her character. Making a serious character into a joke is an easy thing, but a joke into a real character is a much harder process. \\n\\n\r\nAquor's rival group, Saint Snow, is certainly more interesting than the original's counterpart. Ria and Seira aren't successful because they are 'perfect' idols, but rather because they have their own unique thing going on. There's a neat contrast between the traditional, idol-y nature of Aquors, and Saint Snow's more eclectic Babymetal leanings. Ria and Seira have reason to be hostile-- Aquors is the exact opposite of what they want to be.\\n\\n\r\nIf you were to ask me why I have spent so much time comparing Sunshine to the original series, rather than discussing it solely on its own merits, it is because Sunshine itself does so on a regular basis. It doesn't try or even want to disconnect itself, and instead recognises and pays respect to Muse. The girls of Aquors started their group precisely because they were fans of Muse. It's the appropriate turn to take the franchise; if it attempted to be entirely its own thing, never making a reference to the original, it would feel a bit distasteful, considering just how similar a road the two shows travel. The only troubling part of it all is that it makes you long for Muse all the more. \\n\\n\r\nSunshine continues the tradition of having some of the best music in the entire idol industry. I would argue that songs like \"Todokanai Hoshi datoshitemo\" and \"Kimi no Kokoro wa Kagaiyaiteru kai?\" are better than most of what real idol groups (Momoiro Clover et al.) produce. There may not be any real bangers like Start:Dash or Snow Halation, but I do find Aquors sneaking their way onto my playlist every now and then, too. Ruby's voice also may not be quite as lovely as Nico's or Kotori's, but she's still hella cute regardless.\\n\\n\r\nIf it weren't being compared to its predecessor, Love Live Sunshine would still be one of the best idol anime produced. I have no problem with it, stumbles and tumbles aside, and can see both Love Live fans and newcomers to the franchise having a great time with it. \\n\\n\r\nAquors just have yet to convince me that they are capable of standing on the same stage that Muse once did. I'm open to being convinced otherwise-- heck, I want, and I expect to be convinced otherwise. There are certainly worse ways to start.",

            "content": "Last year, we were told that \u03bc's had come to an end and a PV of the new LL! idol group was shown. Their name is Aqours. They are going to continue on the \u03bc's legacy and (try to) become more successful than \u03bc's. They are namely, Chika, Riko, You, Ruby, Yoshiko (or Yohane whichever preferred), Hanamaru, Dia, Mari and Kanan. I had indifferent opinions about them at first. I didn't delve too deep like how I did during the \u03bc's era to be honest. None of them interested me because the brand new LL!Sunshine!! project was too rushed, where \u03bc's was still around andhad their movie and their Final Live concert upcoming. While the news gave a slap to all the LL! fans, most of us started to worry if Aqours could do better than their predecessors.\\n\\n\r\nNow that it comes to an end with its finale being aired last night. Let's go!\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nNote: In LL!, story, is NEVER ever the selling point. Same goes to LLSS!!.\\n\\n\r\nReusing and referencing the good ol' stuff from \u03bc's isn't a bad thing if the series is executed well. As a fan of the original LL! I sincerely hope that LLSS!! is better, or at least on par, with the original. Surely, the beginning looked promising and didn't disappoint me, and the rest of the series didn't either. A good beginning makes a good ending, eh? Not happening in LLSS!!, unfortunately.\\n\\n\r\nI am here just going to say, the ending... is not meant for everyone. The way the series ended was, not something I will rate 1/10 but still, bad. It could be done better but man, imagine you are sitting on the LLSS!! hype train all along the journey just to reach a cliff and everything goes downhill and bam.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOne thing you can never complain in LL! and LLSS!! is their art. It's really good, and the art improves so much coming to LLSS!!. (tho the CG dance may be pretty annoying from time to time)\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nFor OP, OST and ED, they are really good. VAs did their amazing work too.\\n\\n\r\nMy only concern goes to the inserts. They ARE good, but not impacting enough in their respective episodes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI have a mixed feeling about the characters itself. 3rd years' (Mari, Kanan, Dia) chemistry is great even though I am not a fan of either one of them. 1st years (Ruby, Hanamaru, Yoshiko) did a great job too though I never like Yoshiko (sorry but chuuni isn't to my liking). 2nd years (Chika, You, Riko) tho, they have the same problem as \u03bc's (Kotori, Honoka, Umi) had. There's too much focus for them, and they aren't that great either.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI swear I really enjoy everything up to the 12th episode, but the finale is.... wew. Let's not talk about the weird skit which I think it's actually okay-ish, I am disappointed by the absence of \"Step ZERO to ONE\" after being referenced so much in the anime. The question \"Why do you not perform it and instead using a new song that doesn't give that much impact as a finale?\" will always be in my head from now on.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10 (Revised score: 8/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe series is good, but nowhere better than the original LL! first season imo. \\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: A good start, with a badly executed ending.",

            "content": "Love Live is back with another fresh cast of characters who, let's be real here, are all waifu-worthy judging by their looks alone. I myself was skeptical at first, incredibly worried this may be a case of \"milking the cash cow\". Thankfully, no. Sunshine has even surpassed the first season of the original Love Live in my eyes. Honestly, I'm quite surprised with the outcome.\r\nSunshine starts off with a story that sounds undeniably similar to that of the original. Let me clarify-- it's not an exact story copy. I'd say only the base, its starting point, is the same. We won't, for instance, see ourlovely Nico look-a-like in the same kind of situation as the real Nico. The girls of Aqours each have their own story to tell.\\n\\n\r\nIt certainly is hard to make a good anime with this many main characters in such a short amount of time. Love Live Sunshine is no different. Just like its predecessor, the girls did not receive an enormous amount of development. What do you expect from a show with nine main characters and just thirteen episodes? Things could've been handled differently. Sunshine, unfortunately, repeats the same mistakes. A future second season would set things straight, probably, though. Yes, again, similar to the original. Then, why did I give Sunshine a much higher rating? I'll get to that in a bit.\\n\\n\r\nI don't blame anyone with a huge attachment to Muse to doubt the new series, with the introduction of complete new characters. Aware of that, though, I think they should still give Aqours a chance, a chance to shine. And, it sure did shine. Sunshine's cast is a whole lot more likeable and memorable than its predecessor. I had an easy time liking the characters, and even sympathized with them during emotional scenes-- even if I didn't like them one bit initially. Mari and You, just to note a few examples. The new girls are what made Sunshine so much better for me personally.\\n\\n\r\nTalking a little about my favorites; Chika, pretty much an exact copy of Honoka, the side-ponytail being the only difference. I'm quite fond of her positiveness and leadership ability, and basically being the driving force of the group. Honoka was one of my personal favorites from Muse-- it wouldn't be that strange to have Chika as one of my favorite Aqours girl as well. Hanamaru, or rather Zuramaru as I like to call her, is a fun character, too. Not only is her lack of tech knowledge humorous, her zura's are also very charming. \"It's the future, zura!\" The girls each have their own quirks, some which may be irritating, and some that are genuinely fun. The one character with a disturbing amount of annoyance, though, is Yoshiko. She reminds me of that one Chuunibyou show I didn't like very much. Yoshiko comes over as obnoxious, and feels completely out of place. I'd much rather have a different girl in her stead. Oh well, it can't be helped.\\n\\n\r\nWhat's more disappointing is the fact that a couple did not receive the screen time they deserved. And by that, I'm actually mostly referring to a certain blue haired, ponytailed goddess. She had so little screen time in the first half of the show, I was starting to question whether or not she'll become a member of Aqours later. I guess that beach episode made up for it... uh, just a little bit. Kanan is a fine-looking lady for sure!\\n\\n\r\nWho is the real star of Aqours? The girl - who coincidentally looks a lot like Nico - with the gorgeous red twintails and aqua eyes, of course! Her name is Ruby, the one who invented cuteness and has the voice of an angel. She certainly stands out the most with her design, cute expressions and such. She made her debut in the first episode unlike the Nico. Ruby has already accumulated quite a reputation by just a couple scenes alone-- and now that I think about it, the show needed more of those. The more we got to the end, the less Ruby we got. Though, I was honestly not that upset about it. It indicates how much I actually liked Sunshine, even with the absence of Ruby in the latter episodes. Keep staying unbearably cute, it makes my life so much better. I am keeping this short, since I do not want this to turn into a Ruby love post. (I love her.)\\n\\n\r\nNow, I do have to mention that none of the new characters have been able to completely fill the gap that's been left behind by Nico. Ruby, though, is the cutest in the whole wide world and tries her absolute \"Rubesty\" to make up for it. Her efforts, however, were in vain. I still missed hearing the phrase \"Nico-Nico nii,\" but, oh well, I guess \"Ganbaruby\" is a decent enough replacement. I kind of go a little crazy whenever Ruby says it.\\n\\n\r\nSomething that was quite bothersome was that there was no audition process of sorts going on. Chika was captivated by the beauty of this natural wonder, named Ruby. She got an invitation right on the spot. Apparently, looking gorgeous and cute is all that's needed for one to become a true school idol. Singing and dancing skills are irrelevant. Seriously though, this part has been ignored, yet again.\\n\\n\r\nNotable are the outstanding visuals, a huge improvement over the original. The show is very colorful and the background sceneries are very pretty, especially the seaside ones. And yes, there's still the use of 3DCGI during live performances. However, in Sunshine, it's less distracting, more fluid, and should now be on a tolerable level, which makes it more enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is what you would expect from the Love Live series. The musical performances are outstanding and definitely worthy of praise. The hardships the girls went through, following their dreams-- you can actually feel the emotions they put into their songs. Mirai Ticket, sung in the final episode, is especially a good example. The vocals are great and the voices of all Aqours girls fit well with each other, not to mention the regular voice acting is admirable, too. Have I already mentioned Ruby's angelic voice? Great background music as well.\\n\\n\r\nIf you had any doubts about Sunshine, I can assure you, there is little to worry about. It's certainly an enjoyable show for fans and newcomers alike. Just remember that Ruby is best. I'm very disappointed, though, that the anime did not learn from its past mistakes. Sunshine has the potential of being exceptionally good. And seeing as how popular the Love Live franchise is (especially in Japan!), it will surely get a second season in order to make that happen, and flesh out the characters a bit more. I look forward to the day I see my lovely Ruby animated again.\\n\\n\r\n\"Let's change that zero into a one!\"",

Well, then you've seen Love Live Sunshine too, without even knowing.\r\n- Plot: \r\nThe plot is badly copied from the first Love Live. Sunshine is made basically just to milk the cow and to make fanboys scream of joy cause now they can ship more idols and make more memes about it.\r\nThe story is often slow-paced when nothing is happening and it's light speed fast when it comes to interesting moments. Indeed it's like everything happens behind the scenes while you're not watching and along the anime you're probably gonna ask yourself \"How?\" more often than you wouldexpect. Also, most of the useless and casual stuff that happen is very predictable and clich\u00e9.\\n\r\nIn general it feels like creators had in mind how cool moments should have happened but they didn't know how to arrive to them.\\n\\n\r\n- Characters:\\n\r\nGenerally characters have no defined personality, like if they ran out of stereotypes so they made them as plain and vague as possible just to make everyone happy. Rather than taking the opportunity to do something good, events that should help you knowing the characters a bit deeper happen in dumb funny ways.\\n\\n\r\n- Animation and art:\\n\r\nCharacters pretty much look as if they were from \u03bc's but with different hair and eye colors. The animation is decent even if there's still CGI in some parts of dancing scenes, like in Love Live.\\n\\n\r\n- Sound:\\n\r\nI really like \u03bc'sic and I pretty much like Aqours songs too, it's the only good point of this anime.",

Nothing about Sunshine is better or probably even on par to School Idol Project. Even so, Sunshine did shower the community with glorious memes, and I\u2019m serious, these memes will give you terminal illnesses in all the right ways. While nowhere near as deep as the ones in School Idol Project (who weren\u2019t even that deep to begin with), the characters in Sunshine are super quirky and gimmicky to the point where they were still very amusing. Despite their lack of substantial substance, they are indeed entertaining\u2026 most of the time. Let\u2019s do a comparison.\\n\\n\r\nThe most common comparison I see is Eri X Nozomi and Mari X Dia. Eri-chi was a killjoy, and I didn\u2019t like her at the beginning, yet she also had a very respectable reason behind her cockblocking, and in the end she was ultimately a very positive experience for Muse. The influence of a professional dancer motivated Honoka to get off her ass and take her idol passion much more seriously. Nozomi secretly supported Muse, but didn't do it in a way that undermined Eri's efforts. Unlike Mari. What did Mari do? Mari is definitely more than just a JOKE :3, she\u2019s actually pretty deep. But unlike Nozomi, she was extremely one-sided in supporting Aqours and didn't show shred of subtlety, putting Dia and Kanan into awkward situations. This does make her somewhat of a more realistic character though. Dia played the role of Eri, but unlike Eri, she didn't have that reality jarring impact on Aqours. In fact, the characters in Sunshine that really drilled the seriousness of being an idol was a rival group introduced in the second half of the show! Ain\u2019t that great?\\n\\n\r\nAnother easy comparison is Nico Nico Nii and the Fallen Angel Yohane. Both are kind of like \u201cjoke\u201d characters, except there\u2019s one big difference between the two. Nico is also more than a joke character. She\u2019s super condescending and was also kind of a cockblock like Eri, but she also contributed a lot more to the overall growth of Muse. Much like Eri, Nico cemented the fact that Muse was a serious idol group, and that they were basically aiming to be professionals. What did Yohane do? She showed that Aqours has a high tolerance for retardation. She also\u2026 uh\u2026 has a lot of funny faces? You can easily take a screenshot of her face and turn it into a reactionary meme. While Yohane is pretty likable, she's probably the least well written in terms of development. \\n\\n\r\nThere are also characters that many people say are essentially copied and pasted. The main character of Sunshine, Chika, is literally just Honoka 2.0. Riko is just two School Idol Project characters in one, Maki and Umi. \\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s also You and ZURAMARU, who kind of act like supports for Chika and Ruby respectively. They are also my favorite characters of the series. Despite usually just being there to push their respective girlfriends on and giving them moral support, they actually ended up being much more likable in my eyes. Zuramaru in particular had a very heartwarming scene where she pushed Ruby on to become an idol, for that was what Ruby always wanted. It had a sense of accomplishment, yet also melancholy, for it felt like Zuramaru accomplished the very thing her character was created for in the first place. So what was the need for her? Indeed, the story then turns her into a comedic sidekick type of character, which despite being detrimental in the long run, it ended up being all good cause she\u2019s adorable af. You kept up her relevance throughout the series because Chika was the main character, so of course they would focus on her more. Even so, You was pretty passive in her support of Chika, and instead of pushing her on with ultra positivity like Kotori or being on top of things like Umi, You kinda just follows Chika around. None of the characters really push Chika on. They kinda just sit there and eventually Chika realizes what she should do, and everyone does a totally heterosexual group hug or something. There's Riko, who actually gets supported more than she supports. She goes through a very similar situation to Kotori, as well as Mari. There's Dia, who serves as the first cockblock out of many, who started off as a clean copy of Eri, imouto and all. She then turns into another Umi right after. There\u2019s also Kanan, who at first was an even bigger cockblock than Eri-chi could ever be, only to be revealed as a very good human being who only cared for Mari\u2019s future. She basically pulled a Hachiman/Homura and became a cockblock for the sake of others. SHE\u2019S BATMAN!\\n\\n\r\nSunshine had some moments though. It was pretty funny once in a while, although the humor is super forced at times, and the drama was pretty impactful some of the time, even though it was way too sappy. Losing sucks. The damn music scene is competitive as fuck. I should know, I\u2019m a songwriter after all. It\u2019s also basically two idol stories in one. You nerds can get double the sappiness. The story about the original 3 school idols was honestly better than anything related to Aqours. Also, at like the end of the season, Aqours stopped comparing themselves to Muse. I\u2019m hoping for a Muse comparison free season 2! Or even better, a season 2 with Muse in it! The music is on par to School Idol Project I guess, although I don\u2019t even like idol music. The ED is catchy though. Uh, what else is good? Yohane has nice legs. Um, Ruby dabs at some point. There\u2019s also BABY ZURAMARU!\\n\\n\r\nLong story short, Sunshine is basically season one of School Idol Project cut in half. It isn\u2019t really about Aqours becoming an idol group, it\u2019s about how Chika\u2019s journey in trying to form an idol group changes those around her for good. That\u2019s exactly what School Idol Project was like, Honoka\u2019s dedication pulling the heartstrings of those around her. The thing is, get this, School Idol Project is ALSO about Muse becoming an idol group! It focuses on the development of Muse as much as it does on the development of the characters. Sunshine only focused on the characters and didn\u2019t even do that as well as School Idol Project did. Maybe it\u2019s cause Sunshine needs a goddamn season 2, but simply being comparable to the first season of School Idol Project ain't so good, cause the first season was pretty SHIT.\\n\\n\r\nBut at least we get more memes and shitty character designs!\\n\\n\r\nOh yes, ranking the girls. From best to worst...\\n\\n\r\n(Keep in mind that for the most part, I like all the characters)\\n\\n\r\n Yousoro > Rick > Hannahmahroo > Autism 101 > Honk 2.0 > Kananyounot? > I wanna Dia > Mary > Gangstarooby\\n\\n",

            "content": "It would have been so easy for them to make this anime good. However, Sunshine takes what made the original series so magical and throws it out the window. If you've seen the original Love Live series, you probably shouldn't watch Sunshine. If you haven't... maybe you'll find something enjoyable in it? This review will contain spoilers for the original series, though, as you're supposed to have seen it already.\r\nFirst, I should admit that the animation is amazing. It's definitely a step up from the original series, and you can see proof of that in the very first episode. That doesn't stop it from havingCGI dance sequences, though. The only one that was fully hand-drawn was the performance by the \"rival\" idol group that is only relevant for about one episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is also amazing. As much as I love Muse, Aqours just has better singers. However, some songs do tend to bleed together. Yume de Yozora wo Terashitai sounds very similar to Mijuku DREAMER, for example. However, there is a fatal problem related to the music, which I'll go into in a little bit.\\n\\n\r\nNow that I've talked about the good aspects of this series, it's time to talk about what killed it: the writing. Unlike in the original series, the MC here has no particular reason for becoming a school idol - whereas Honoka wanted to save the school, Chika wanted to be an idol for its own sake (a realization that took Honoka a long time to have). I have no problem with this - though it does make Kimeta yo Hand in Hand (the Susume->Tomorrow of Sunshine) lose a lot of impact.\\n\\n\r\nBut wait! There is a reason! Several episodes in, we learn that - *gasp* - the school is in danger. And this is when the problems with this series start to really show themselves. Simply put, Aqours is a bunch of Muse fangirls. They could hardly go a single episode without making a reference to them, and they were even HAPPY when they heard the bad news about their school - because now they could be more like Muse. This series lives in Muse's shadow and never really steps out of it.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Muse, let's take a moment and remember why we loved that series. The original Love Live anime was a story of nine girls pouring in blood, sweat, and tears to protect the school that their families have been attending for generations. Then they poured in blood, sweat, and tears to be the best idols they could be. Then, once they were standing on top of the world, they poured in blood, sweat, and tears to ensure that school idols would live on forever.\\n\\n\r\nNotice how much I said \"blood, sweat, and tears.\" There were countless scenes of the characters practicing their dancing, worrying about costumes, asking Eli to coach them, and so on. We saw all the effort they put into their activities, which made their successes all the more rewarding. Sunshine has... maybe two practice scenes? There was one in episode eleven, and I think there might have been one or two brief ones earlier. The original series used the practice scenes for character development (and the performances, which I'll get to in a second), while Sunshine does character development in other ways. Which is fine, but we still need to see the girls practice. When their performances happen, they don't feel believable. It doesn't feel like they've earned it.\\n\\n\r\nAND speaking of the performances, let's talk about why the ones in Sunshine were disappointing. In the original series, most of the performances (not quite all, but nearly all) were situated within the context of the anime. It was \"okay, we're going to perform now,\" and then they performed. In season one, the only one that wasn't like this was Susume->Tomorrow. Since context was given for these performances, we knew that they were actually happening. We could focus on the lyrics - which were ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY, as they often served to summarize or even develop the characters' feelings up until that moment. Who can forget the moment when Honoka, Umi, and Kotori performed START:DASH!! in an empty auditorium? Who can forget the moment when Rin led the team in performing Love wing bell? Not only did we see the characters earn their performances (as discussed above), but we also saw how their performances affected them.\\n\\n\r\nIn Sunshine, three of the six insert songs are just kinda... shoved in there. With no context. Even the movie had little segues into Hello, Hoshi wo Kazoete and ?<-HEARTBEAT. But Sunshine just plops the characters into stage outfits and shows them performing in some random place. We have no way of knowing if they're actually happening in-universe. How, then, are we supposed to take them seriously? Why are we supposed to care?\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair, episode eleven of Sunshine is good. We see the girls practice, we see their feelings develop over the course of the episode, and the insert song is rooted in the context of the story. Plus, its lyrics are extremely relevant to the characters' feelings. It felt like classic Love Live. It made me wish we'd been getting that all season.\\n\\n\r\nOh, I haven't even gotten to the writing yet. The writing is... man, I wish I could say it was good. But it wasn't. I talked earlier about the \"save the school\" plot being reused. I can't say I'm entirely opposed to it, but I feel like it would only have worked if they had been up-front about it. Bring it up in episode one. Don't fake us out and make us think you might be doing something different. But anyway! The constant references to Muse get old really quick. They happened so often that I thought they were set-up for a \"we need to step out of their shadow and be our own group\" realization, but that never happened.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then there's the third-year subplot. This permeates the first half of the series, eventually being resolved in episode nine, and the tone is unreal. It feels very gloomy and depressing - very strange for Love Live. The rest of the time, the show's tone is exactly what you'd expect from a Love Live anime, and the juxtaposition is jarring and rough. It feels like the plot to a late-night drama got mixed into the happy, fun idol show. And when this subplot does get resolved, the reasoning behind the offending character's actions is very flimsy, hard to believe, and - frankly - insulting. When it was first revealed, my reaction was, \"They expect me to buy this?\" It left a lot of actions unexplained, it blatantly contradicted plenty of other scenes we'd seen in earlier episodes, and it just reeked of bad writing. And then, in the very next episode, Chika does the exact thing that this subplot condemned - and gets rewarded for it!\\n\\n\r\nOh, and let's not forget the yuribait. It was very heavy. In fact, I'm not sure it can even be called \"bait.\" It was just plain old yuri (that never ended up going anywhere). Don't get me wrong - I love yuri. I own eight NicoMaki doujinshi. But it didn't add anything to Sunshine. The involved characters didn't gain any development, and the yuri never went beyond one line at the end of episode ten. A line that, might I add, would be the precursor to a romantic subplot in just about any other anime. It felt like they were trying to pander to fudanshi in the same way that they were pandering to Muse nostalgia for the rest of the series. I was, again, kind of insulted that they thought we'd buy it if they splashed a little yuri in there somewhere.\\n\\n\r\nThen good things spontaneously start happening for our characters for no reason, as they'd only canonically had two performances so far (one of which was a local event, the other of which was a flop). And half of episode thirteen is dedicated to a recap of the season. No, seriously. And this recap illustrates all the things I've been talking about. They never really earned any of the popularity they got at any point in the series. There never really was a good reason for Yohane to join the group - they even glossed over it in the recap. And there never really was any reason to care about the group's successes and failures.\\n\\n\r\nI really wanted to like this anime. At first, I figured it could never live up to the legacy of the original series, but I decided to give it a fair chance. And I realized that my original misgivings were right on the money. Sunshine was plagued by bad writing, meaningless performances, and nervous desperation as it tried to simultaneously lean on Muse for support and ignore the secrets to Muse's success.\\n\\n\r\nMy final rating for Love Live! School idol project Sunshine!! is a four out of ten.\\n\\n\r\nOh dear lord this review is long. If you've read this far, thanks.",

            "content": "Following up on such a well loved series is no simple task. Whether they're big fans of the original or never liked the series in the first place there's always going to be skeptics who throw around generic phrases like 'milking the cash cow' when an anime studio so much as thinks of continuing a popular series. Sometimes you can win them over, but most of the time they like to stubbornly stick by their viewpoints even it goes against all logical thinking. But regardless of how baffling I find the point of view that these people have, I'm not here to talk about themor the fan reaction to this series. I'm not here to make comparisons to the original series either. I'm here to talk about the series.\\n\\n\r\nLove Live Sunshine is a continuation of the original series which I loved very much. But I think Sunshine has its own set of unique strengths. Some have even argued that these strengths make it a better series than the original. But what I find great about Sunshine is that its good points don't detract from what made the original series great. It's a fantastic series that stands out on its own merits. I feel like slovenly comparing the two in that way doesn't do either series justice. As such, I will refrain from making comparisons to the original unless I feel it's absolutely necessary.\\n\\n\r\nChika Takami is a normal girl wasting away her days going through the motions like any other high school girl. But she's no longer content with living that kind of life.  When she sees \u00b5's on the big screen of the UTX building in Akihabara (Which I've just recently found out is called the 'UDX' building in real life. Pretty cool huh?) something in her mind clicks. She's finally found a way to break the mould and escape her normal everyday life. That's the basic setup at least. Obviously their journey isn't as easy as it initially seems, but what makes Sunshine uniquely interesting is the nature of the potholes on their road to success. Pretty much everyone who heard \u00b5's was on their side. It was just a matter of getting people to hear them out. As is natural for a series of that nature there are complications along the way but they're mostly irrelevant to how the people react to their music. The problems they faced were mostly either internal conflict or getting people to notice them. But when \u00b5's put in their best effort and succeeded nearly every time. Sunshine does deal with those very same themes in its own way, but it also deals with heavily a theme that the original series never really touched upon. Rejection. People who heard what they had to say, considered where they were coming from and just said 'no'.\\n\\n\r\nI'm honestly not sure if a theme like that would be a good fit in the original series. But this is a completely new series and Sunrise have taken this as an opportunity to try something completely new. While the show also deals with many of the same themes as the original, it does so in a very different way. The show initially lures you into believing that the impact \u00b5's has had means their journey is gonna be a walk in the park. Right? Right? Wrong! Not only are they outright rejected on a number of occasions, but they have an even harder time getting people to hear them out. School idols are everywhere in this day and age so standing out from the crowd is a lot more difficult. Even their flashy Babymetal-esque rivals Saint Snow have difficulty getting people on their side. Plus unlike \u00b5's, Aqours don't live in the heart of Tokyo and getting people to notice them out in the middle of nowhere is a very difficult task. \\n\\n\r\nTo put it simply, they're being brought down by circumstances completely out of their control. You can understand their frustration over being in this situation because these are all problems that everyone has to face at some point in their life. These themes aren't some super complex analysis of the human condition, but they're a perfect fit for the type of series that Love Live Sunshine is trying to be. Not only are the themes relatable to a lot of people regardless of cirmustance, but they're executed really well... at least for the most part. If I had to make a criticism (And I kinda do since this a review and not just a discussion of why I love the show) it's that it takes a while to get really stuck into the themes. The show is very deliberately paced and every episode is filled with great moments, but it's not until the final few episodes where the show really flourishes. That's not to say what comes before it is a waste of time. But even though I thoroughly enjoyed the series from start to finish its finest moments are definitely during the latter episodes. That being said this is admittedly a very weak criticism. I found the show as a whole to be fantastic and I can't imagine those last few episodes being anywhere near as impactful had it not been for everything that came before it.\\n\\n\r\nA new series brings with it a new set of characters and I was really impressed with what they brought to the table this time around. They've all got their cute little quirks and catchphrases as expected but there's a little bit more to them once you get past all that. In terms of comedy the 9 girls all have a great dynamic and bounce off of each other really well when the show wants to make the viewer laugh. But they've also got a wide range of emotions as well as a number of flaws. It's nothing ultra complicated but there's enough to them so that they feel more human and believable than what some would argue (Looking at you Yamakan) is necessary in this kind of series. \\n\\n\r\nWhen I read the character descriptions I was particularly worried about Yohane since Chuunibyou's are a very stale trope in anime. But the show does a fantastic job of justifying her reasons for being that way and her love of the occult. Ruby is often shy and scared but when the going gets tough she isn't afraid to get assertive. Hanamaru is kind and pleasant to a fault but she's also a goofball and an antisocial bookworm who has trouble making friends. I could go on to describe what makes each and every character great and how they evolve over the course of the series but I'm rambling enough as it is. Though I think what's most important in creating a strong show is a strong lead character and Chika certainly delivers. Chika always wants to do the best she can by her friends but she isn't without her flaws. As much as she tries she's not always capable of making a difference. But over the course of the series she becomes more understanding of her own limitations and more reliant on the people around her. Not only does this make her a likeable character, but a believable one too. And the same goes for the rest of the cast too.\\n\\n\r\nThough there is an elephant in the room that I think is worth discussing. Kanan. All things considered she did get a good amount of attention in the later episodes and the buildup to that point was handled very well. But when you're watching the show weekly you just can't help but wonder 'Where's Kanan?'. Fortunately, the resolution to the conflict between the third years is probably one of the best moments in the entire show. Conflict between characters can make or break a series depending on how it's handled. In Love Live's Sunshine's case, it brings about some of the show's very best moments. The show's world is definitely an exaggerated version of reality but every problem they face arises naturally. They're problems that one can reasonably expect to occur in their situation and they're always solved in an emotionally satisfying way. Simply put, the characters and their interactions are probably Love Live Sunshine's greatest strength.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in Love Live Sunshine is a definite strong point of the series but I wouldn't call it mind blowing. It's a very good looking show that definitely blows the vast majority of anime out of the water. That being said the production quality isn't on the same level as something like Madoka Magica, Fate/Zero or a KyoAni production. Just like the original series the show mixes 2D and 3D animation for its performance scenes and they're an absolute visual treat with a lot of great effects and some very memorable choreography. I've come to accept that the CG animation is an intentional design choice so I'm not going to criticise the show just because they use that style. However it definitely does look a bit wonky on occasions and even at its best it never looks as good as the 2D animation. But overall, when it comes to the visuals the positive far outweigh the positives.\\n\\n\r\nOf course another important aspect in a show like this is the sound. I mean, it is an idol show right? The voice acting, the songs, the sound design, the background music, all of this is very important. The show isn't flawless in every regard but the way the show uses sound is definitely one of its strengths. The songs themselves are plentiful, diverse and very easy on the ears to say the least. The fast paced energy of the opening theme that gets you hyped for the episode, the infectious bouncy melody of Kimeta yo Hand in Hand, the pounding bass drum and soaring vocals in Mijuku Dreamer. Even if you were to detach the songs from the flashy choreography in the performance scenes there's a lot to talk about. Not every song is as awesome as Mijuku Dreamer, but they're all great for their own reasons and not one of them is a dud.\\n\\n\r\nOn the topic of sound, voice acting! While there are quite a few well known seiyuu playing side characters every single one of the 9 girls is played by a newbie. That being said, they've obviously been trained very well. The girls all sound distinctive and their acting is on point nailing both the light hearted comedy scenes and the more dramatic moments of the series. There are a few missed lip flaps and awkward line reads, but in the grand scheme of things these are relatively minor flaws. The seiyuu performances are a key aspect of any show like this and Love Live Sunshine does not disappoint. Just like its predecessor, Sunshine does indeed have an English dub. While NIS America handled the first series in conjunction with Bang Zoom, Love Live Sunshine is entirely a Funimation effort. Moving from Texas to LA means there's a whole new talent pool to work with and the dub uses this to its advantage with a good mix of newbies and veterans from the area. In an effort to remain consistent with the original series the English dub is directed by Caitlin Glass who played Maki in the original series. However, just like the Japanese version, there are no returning cast members. There's definitely some awkward line reads and questionable translation choices here and there but all things considered it's a very solid dub handled by a team of people who evidently enjoy working on the show. However in this case I have to say my preference is with the original Japanese version.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Love Live Sunshine was an unexpectedly great series that follows up on the original in a very big way. Rather than relying on what made the original series great, Sunshine (And Aqours) establishes itself as something uniquely amazing. I could go on forever talking about everything this show does right yet my issues with the show are relatively minor. It's obligatory that I mention the things that bothered me in a review, but honestly I could spend way longer talking about why I loved the show. It's very rare that a show elicits that kind of positive response out of me so obviously they've done something right. Love Live Sunshine is undeniably something special and I would be very surprised if anything else can take its place as my favourite anime of 2016.",

She realized the wonders of school idols, and decided to do it withher friends. She wanted to have a goal, and she wanted to work hard for it. She wants to shine.\\n\\n\r\nBeing the most anticipated anime for Summer 2016, many are quick to hate on it. You'll often hear claims that it's just a rehash of the first series, that the plot is the same for both. But what makes up a plot, anyways? Is it how things go, the events that happen; or is it the reason, the \"why\", to the things that happen? I'll let you decide for your self.\\n\\n\r\nAs this is the second anime series under the Love Live franchise, you'd expect it to more or less have the same strengths and weaknesses in the overall animation. Like the clean character designs, and the god awful 3DCG when dancing. Surprisingly, though, Sunshine is all strengths. Sunrise (the animators) delivered an overwhelming upgrade to its aesthetics. The art is really detailed and clean. Characters are refined, and the scenery and background are really spectacular. The animation is smooth and fluid, and the 3DCG now fits into the sequencing with better motion and design. Also, the water is really really marvelous. It resembles more the School Idol Movie than it does the original series.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is understandably outstanding. The voice acting fits the characters personalities, and feels natural to listen to. The sound effects are consistent and doesn't overpower the main dialogue, and the ambient sounds pay close attention to detail. There's always the low and soft sound of water moving and waves crashing when they're near a body of water, and there are random seagull squawks every now and then, as expected of a seaside town. It makes you feel like you''re genuinely there. The background music fits with the atmosphere, and carries the many emotions of the show. As for the songs, you can expect it to be great. The opening and ending themes are catchy and tells the story of them as they start out. The songs are good as it is, but gets even better with the emphasis they put on them.\\n\\n\r\nThe concept for the story is pretty straightforward, and that is good for a fun show about girls following their dreams and having fun. This isn't meant to be a deep and complex story. The pacing is perfect. Events happen and change at a decently slow speed, which gives more time for the characters to interact, and for their feelings to show and intentions to take shape. With this, the development of each character is clear. Also, Sunshine goes to great lengths and makes excellent use of its elements in emphasizing their characters struggles and accomplishments, creating these beautiful and touching moments unexpected to the viewer, making it that much more of an enjoyable and memorable show.\\n\\n\r\nI loved the first series, and I went into Sunshine knowing that I would also love it. It could have just been me being biased, or it could have just been them riding the immense wave of popularity left by \u00b5's, so I wondering if they could really do it. But I honestly didn't expect it to be this good. It's been breaking a lot of my expectations, and I have high hopes for this series. I want to see the heights they'll take this golden opportunity to and make a name for themselves. Already, they are shining, but I believe they'll become greater and brighter.",

            "content": "Love Live Sunshine is the second installment of the very popular Love Live franchise. There were people when this anime was announced were unhappy this even existed and couldn't come to grasp that Muse was officially over. The anime has officially wrapped up so the question is, does it live up the expectations set by its predecessor? \r\nMINOR SPOILER WARNING\r\nStory: 8\r\nOne of the bigger complaints when this anime was first announced and what was shown in the first few episodes is the copy/paste of the plot from the original Love Live. Such moments include the student council president forbidding a school idol club, a girlwho's good at the piano but initially refuses to be a part of the idol group, the \"Start Dash\" moment of the first performance, etc. The main ideas of those plot points are in there but are executed differently. For example, Dia's reason for not allowing a school idol club makes sense (although selfish) instead of Eli's reasoning of trying to save the school her way and not something as silly as a school idol club. \\n\r\nIn all honesty, I think the story was one of the better parts as they handled the plot portion better and there didn't feel as if there was forced drama. Now let me explain. In the original Love Live, most of the story was just forming the group, practicing, having some cute moments and preparing for Love Live. Somewhere down the line Sunrise figured they needed to add in a drama part so the last 3-4 episodes involved Kotori's decision on going to Los Angeles for fashion. In Sunshine, the drama involved the past of Kanon, Dia, and Mari and why Kanon/Dia were against school idols which was a sub plot up until episode 9 when the full group is formed. Other characters had their drama moments but this was the \"big\" one of the season which I liked.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I felt that even with the plot points of the original present, the full plot was executed better.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\\n\r\nThe CGI looks lots better here. The 2D art makes the girls look really cute and the CGI makes them look really pretty (the performances are probably one of the high points of this show). The scenery and other characters look really well drawn and a pleasant treat for the eyes. Probably one of the best parts of this show for me.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\\n\r\nNow one of the big things about an anime about music is...having good music. The music here is good but it lacks the \"wow\" factor of the original (granted the original Love Live existed for 3 years prior to the anime so they had a selection of music available) but none of the music in Sunshine compared to listening to Bokura wa Ima no Naka de or No Brand Girls for me. Having said that, Young Dreamer is probably my favorite song from Sunshine. Yume Kataru yori Yume Utaou (the ED sang by various combonations of Aqours) is pretty good too.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe best parts of the Love Live franchise are the music and characters. I feel that, compared to the original, the characters here are worse (I do not like Kanon at all) but they're still enjoyable overall. They kind of fill the cliche's from the original (leader, loyal best friend, girl who thinks she doesn't fit as a school idol, shy girl) but how they act and interact with each other is enjoyable. Just like the original, you will probably find a character you really enjoy and take part in the waifu wars for Sunshine.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8:\\n\\n\r\nThis was the one anime I was looking forward to this season so when the weekend came I was ready to watch Sunshine. I liked the anime and enjoyed watching the ups and downs the characters faced in the show and the adventure they went on to become school idols.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8:\\n\\n\r\nSunshine's story is better executed and the art looks better than the original but the music and characters are less enjoyable than the original. Having said that, the girls of Aqours are a good replacement to Muse and can only expect good things in the future from them. Yosoro!",

            "content": "As a big fan of Love Live I was really expecting Love Live Sunshine this summer.  Most of the Love Live fanbase was trying so much to hate this anime since Aquors was replacing \u00b5's and most of them were trying to hate the new girls.  I always thought Sunshine would make a fresh new start in the series and would make us like the new girls in a different way we loved \u00b5's.  Sadly, Love Live Sunshine didn't live up on my expectations, but still it is a very enjoyable anime.\r\nStory 5/10\r\nEven though I started liking the story, the writing becomesrepetitive.  Most of the ideas were taken out from the first anime: Start:Dash moment, school is closing again, some characters were retired idols.  While I feel like \u00b5's spent too much time practicing and worrying about Love Live, Aquors like to hang out and eat ice cream.  During the final episodes, Chika wants to practice a lot, but still, it seems like the anime focuses more on \"cute girls doing cute things\".\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI'm not disappointed with the character writing, but I don't feel overwhelmed neither.  Most of the characters were already written in Love Live.  Chika is a Honoka clone:   it's the exact same character with no actual reason to become school idol except \"I want to shine\".  We have Ruby, a Hanayo-like character who is cute and loves idols.  Dia is the student council president that doesn't want Chika to become an idol at first, exactly like Eli. Mari is a Nozomi like character who says english stuff combined with japanese, she also rubs everyone's breasts...uhh.  Then we have Riko, who is an Um -like character combined with Maki's abilities, she serves as the protagonist main love interest and best friend (I'm not kidding here).  Kanan is a gloomy character that becomes more like Eli as time passes.  Yoshiko is probably one of my favorite characters, even though her character has been done a lot of times; she delivers fun like Nico in a Chunii way, but Nico is probably funnier, and I don't like Nico a lot.  I feel like Hanamaru and You are the best characters here.  You is a girl with a lot of security but she's kind of jealous, she is always smiling  and cheering people up; she isn't a Kotori, since Kotori is always trying to accept everyone's opinions, even when hers are being rejected.  Hanamaru is a Rin-like character, except she isn't Rin; she always says \"zura\" except of \"nya\", but she has a lot of character development and I can understand her character a lot.    \\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAs always, Love Live delivers colorful art along with beautiful music. The animation is fine, thanks to Sunrise.  All performances look gorgeous and the girls look pretty.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is pretty dramatic and funny, so you will always get a lot of laughs and tears.  There aren't many plot twists, so it loses a lot of Enjoyment, since you know the girls are going to make it eventually.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\\n\r\nWith repetitive characters, mediocre story writing, but beautiful music and sound, Love Live Sunshine!! will be loved by LoveLivers but it lacks the spirit the first anime had.",

            "content": "We all know that Love Live! is an economically successful franchise. I admit, I've also sinked some of my money on Love Live! 'cause I'm a big fan of the franchise. So it's no surprise that this got a spin off. I was really hyped for Sunshine and now that I finished the series, did it live up to my expectations?\r\n(This review will contain SPOILERS)\r\n[Story]\r\nWhen Sunshine got announced, I got really excited because I wanted to see more Love Live!. I was skeptical though because when I saw the 10 minutes character introduction PV for LL Sunshine, not only do some characters of this newgroup look like the original cast from Love Live! (You and Kotori, Mari and Eli, and etc.) but also, some of the characters' personalities are alike. They basically show you the bio of the new characters in the video and that's how I learned about their personalities. \\n\\n\r\nJust like the 1st Season of Love Live!, the story here is relatively simple and fairly similar to the 1st Season of LL. The difference here is Love Live! Sunshine!! takes place about 5 years after  \u00b5's disbanded and now focuses on a new group called \"Aquors\" (pronounced as Aqua) which consists of 9 girls aspiring to become the next famous school idol like  \u00b5's. Just like the previous seasons of Love Live though, I don't really give a shit about the story since the school idols are the main focus of the series and the songs. \\n\\n\r\nThe aspect that I found a bit annoying, but nothing major, in Sunshine is the constant references of \u00b5's and callbacks. Yes, I get it. They won Love Live and they're very famous but I just found it really annoying that the show constantly mentions \u00b5's this and that. For example, the episode that introduced us to Hanamaru. I got really irritated at the end of the episode because of how much they were focusing on Rin's shot. I get it, she's relating herself to Rin but it was too much. Now, there's a reason why I didn't exactly dislike the said aspect that much. \\n\\n\r\nIn the first 7 episodes, Chika was basically following  \u00b5's' footsteps and thinking that if she does exactly what  \u00b5's did, she and her group would become just as popular as  \u00b5's. I'm glad that the 8th episode completely blew my conception of Sunshine being just a \"blatant rip-off of Love Live!\". I really love the 8th episode because it was reality slapping Chika's face. Aquors got 0 points in  the preliminaries and she realizes that ever since  \u00b5's won Love Live, the idol competition has become way more competitive than before and she also realized that simply copying  \u00b5's won't get them to where they want to go. Man, I am loving this \"From nothing to something\" concept that I've been seeing in anime lately. Aquors' song \"Step!Zero to One!\" now makes perfect sense. Btw, that song is really good.  \\n\\n\r\nLove Live Sunshine is also aware of the fact that Aquors is copying \u00b5's and that's the reason why I mostly changed my mind about the constant references and callbacks of \u00b5's in earlier parts of the series. In the 12th episode, Chika realized how \u00b5's exactly got successful and also realized that she needs to stop copying \u00b5's, be their own selves and forge a new path, breaking away from \u00b5's. This whole season is basically about Aquors forming and learning about who they truly are. I'm quite excited for the 2nd Season, now that Aquors is heading on their own path towards success.  \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]: (9.5/10)\\n\r\nThe art style of the original Love Live was decent, at best and the character designs looked good but was too moe, for my taste, but I got used to it. Also, just like everyone else, I hated the use of CGI in \u00b5's Live Shows. However, in Love Live Sunshine, every aspect of the show's visuals and animation is significantly improved. The art style looks better, the visuals and backgrounds is more superior than the predecessor and the character designs looks like more work was put into it. The Live Shows, for once, doesn't burn my eyes. It's looks like Sunrise learned how to utilize and blend the CGI and 2D Animation perfectly. Seriously, watching Aquors' CGI performance was a lot more bearable than watching \u00b5's CGI performance. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________ \\n\r\n[Sound]: (10/10)\\n\r\nAs a \u00b5's fan, I'm sorry for betraying \u00b5's by saying this but Aquors' songs sounds A LOT better than most \u00b5's songs. Aquors songs sounds more energetic and lively as opposed to \u00b5's dramatic-tune and sometimes melancholic but with a touch of happiness (That's the best I can explain \u00b5's songs). In LL 1st Season, the only songs that I liked was START:DASH and Susume Tommorow. In Sunshine, I love almost every song. Some examples are Kimeta yo Hand in Hand, Daisuki Dattara Daijoubu (which completely shits on almost every \u00b5's song that I've listened to in the past few years), Omoi yo hitotsu ni nare, and more because you get what I'm trying say here. I just wished that they used \"Step!Zero to One\" in the last episode because it would have fit the show's context.   \\n\\n\r\nThe OP theme song is \"Aozora Jumping Heart\" by Aquors. I really love this OP the same reason I love the mentioned songs earlier. It's better than the 1st OP of Love Live but it's on par with the 2nd OP of Love Live. \\n\r\nThe ED theme song is \"Yume Kataru yori Yume Utaou \" by Aquors. Just like the first OP, I also love this song but if I have to be more specific, I love the version where only Chika and Riko were singing. I think this is better than the 1st ED of Love Live! but the 2nd ED of Love Live! is still better than Sunshine's ED. \\n\\n\r\nI watched the show in English Dub and Subs but I'm only going to review the Japanese's VA's singing talent. Chika, Riko and You's singing voices are godlike and they're 50% of the reason why Aquors' songs are great. Hell, that's the reason why I think \"Daisuki Dattara Daijoubu\" is better than most \u00b5's songs. Their voices are just absolutely amazing and I'd prefer if Chika, Riko and You have their own subunit. I still don't know why one of Aquors' official subunit comprises of Chika, You and Ruby. It should have been Riko instead of Ruby :/ \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Characters]: (8/10)\\n\r\nDespite all the good things that I've been saying about Aquors, I still like the members of \u00b5's more than the members of Aquors. It's not because Aquors is uninteresting. It's because the characters from Love Live! has way more screentime and character development than Aquors at the moment. Once Sunshine gets 2nd Season and a movie then I'll love Aquors just as much as I love \u00b5's. \\n\\n\r\nLike the original Love Live!, Sunshine has 9 characters and evenly split into 3 girls per grade. I just want to say that the difference between Aquors having 9 members and \u00b5's having 9 members is that \u00b5's 9 members group had meaning into it and makes perfect sense because of the name of their group while Aquors' amount of members is just....umm..yea.....Who cares, right? Gotta stick with the winning formula and I'm not complaining. Anyways, the first years are Ruby Kurosawa, Hanamaru Kunikida and Yoshiko Tsushima (Yohane). Ruby is Dia's younger sister and she's shy and bit of an introvert girl. To make it more simpler, she's like Hanayo except I found Ruby to be a lot more cuter but Hanayo's extreme love for rice was what made her more likable. Hanamaru is Ruby's best friend and she loves to read books and she has little to no knowledge when it comes to technology since she lives at a temple. She says \"zura\" at the end of her sentence all the time. To make it more simpler, she's like Rin except she's a bookworm and she doesn't get on my goddamn nerves. Then there's Yoshiko, a chuunibyou girl who thinks she's the \"fallen angel\" and she prefers to be called by her persona \"Yohane\". Honestly, I still prefer Nico over her but I can't help but love her \"Yohane\" persona. I wouldn't mind sacrificing myself to become her little demon. \\n\\n\r\nThen there's the second years Chika Takami, You Watanabe and Riko Sakurauchi. You (Pronounced as Yo) is Chika's longtime childhood friend and has a habit of dressing up in a sailor suit since she's a marine enthusiast. You is currently my best girl of the series. Judging by her appearance, you'd think she's like Kotori except she's not. Besides her designing Aquors' costumes, hers and Kotori's personality are nothing alike. You is more lively and her voice doesn't make my ears bleed while Kotori is the cute girl but with an ear-piercing voice. As much as I want to make a You pun right now, I don't want to because I love \"you\" and I really don't want to break \"you\" 're heart by making all these terrible puns xD. Chika is the enthusiastic leader of Aquors. I just want to mention that Chika got way more character development than Honoka did in the 1st Season of LL. In the original LL, it wasn't until the 2nd Season where Honoka got a character development. Even so, Chika's character development is already more impressive than Honoka so even though both characters' enthusiasm and determination to reach their goals are the same, I still prefer Chika over Honoka. Riko is a transfer student from Otonokizaka High (\u00b5's school) and a girl who plays the piano. Riko is like a mixture of Umi and Maki and I really like her Maki side. In other words, I like it when Riko gets all flattered over something. \\n\\n\r\nThen there's the third years Dia Kurosawa, Mari Ohara, and Kanan Matsura. Dia (Pronounced as \"Daya\" or as in Diamond) is the student council president. She's mostly like Eli, in terms of her being stubborn at times and the way she acts as a student council president. The similarities are there. The difference here is Dia has a legitimate reason for rejecting Chika's application sheet to form a school idol club. I mean, Eli has a legitimate reason too but both of their reasons are completely different. Mari is a rich girl who decided to come back to Uranohoshi after hearing about someone forming a school idol. I really thought Mari was going to be either Nozomi or Eli but boy, was I wrong. I mean, the only similarities between Mari and Nozomi is they both like to grope someone's breast but other than that, their personalities are completely different. I also love Mari's \"Engrish\" catchphrases. Especially her \"It's joke\" quote and my most favourite is her \"Oh My God!\" quote. Fun fact: Mari's \"It's joke\" quote was kept in the English Dub version but almost every one of her Engrish quotes was changed to an Italian accent. Kanan is that almost non-existent character who barely made an appearance in the first half of the series but had more screentime in the second half. I started liking Kanan more when the third years were getting more focus on the early 2nd half of the series. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]: (8.5/10)\\n\r\nFace it people, \u00b5's time is over and it's Aquors' time to shine. The sooner you accept that, the more you'll enjoy this show like I did. I really enjoyed the characters, especially Chika and her determination to never give up even though she got cornered but managed to got herself out of the position. Plus, the songs are better than most songs from \u00b5's. Currently, my Aquors-created playlist in my phone is now at over 13 songs and counting. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[VERDICT]\\n\r\nWhen Love Live Sunshine and Aquors first got introduced, I was a bit skeptical at first because I thought they wouldn't live up to \u00b5's' greatness. Now that I finished Sunshine, the series blew away my expectations. As of right now, \u00b5's is still better but Aquors has a lot of potential to overtake \u00b5's and as time grows on, they'll either be on par with them or end up being better than them. I mean, most of Aquors' songs are already better than what the 1st Season of LL offered. \\n\r\nThe story is recycled but I kind-of saw this coming since the 2nd Season of LL did the same shit. Also, the \u00b5's references and callbacks were a bit dragged out. The character is where it's at though. The character development for the third years and the 2nd year, especially Chika were really good but just like the 2nd Season of LL, their character development will definitely get better (and hopefully more character development for the first years) once Sunshine gets 2nd Season. \\n\\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL]: (8.5/10)\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+Aquors turned out to be a very lovable idol group at the end of the series\\n\r\n+Aquors' songs are great and better than \u00b5's songs from 1st and 2nd Season \\n\r\n+Enjoyable characters with amazing character dynamics between two or three Aquors members\\n\r\n+Great character development for Chika and the 3rd years\\n\r\n+Visually Appealing Animation\\n\r\n+CGI in Live Shows is significantly improved\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Constant references and callback to \u00b5's got a bit annoying",

            "content": "What does it mean to shine?\r\nIn lieu of the mainstream media and audiences embracing 'dark and mature' storytelling in favor of 'childish junk' catered towards 12 year olds, this question shouldn't even be relevant in today's world. Yet here it is, in all of its glory. And for the past six years, only one franchise dared to ever raise that question in the 2010s.\r\nLove Live has enjoyed worldwide popularity, and not just because it has cute girls and really nice songs. If such were the case, then that would mean stuff like Show by Rock! would be popular. Sunrise doesn't just take what it seesand rolls with it, adding irrelevant junk and catering to '\"realistic\", cute-girls-need-to-suffer fags' and 'wish-fulfillment' like IM@S does, but instead, takes the whole package; by creating story about girls striving to shine, and really, that's all it needs to be. \"So, how different, then, is it from other idol shit like Aikatsu?\" I'll tell you why.\\n\\n\r\nBecause Love Live succeeds at it. Especially Sunshine.\\n\\n\r\nI'll be the first to admit that I was downright skeptical when this was first announced. I was worried it was going to be a copy of the first season, making the same formulaic recruitment episodes and drama, and the mistakes that plagued it. And oh boy was I wrong. I mentioned earlier that Sunrise takes the 'whole package', so what exactly is in it? It's everything about idols. From the way they dress, what they sing down to the girl's personalities and the struggles of adolescence. However, they didn't always succeed at using it. Let's date back to the first Love Live season. While superb in its own way, there were things that prevented perfect enjoyment, such as issues with characterization and drama, as well as circumstances that made little to no sense on the part of some character arcs. All of these problems were whisked away with the advent of Love Live S2, which is probably the most inspiring piece of media I have ever watched. No teen melodrama or action-induced fantasy isekai story is able to say \"go do something better with your life\" better than this particular second season has, filled to the brim with sad and happy moments that touch my heart deeply. And after just one year after Muse ended their story, Sunshine arrived. \\n\r\nSeeing as it'd be another first season, you could understand my fear. But Sunshine does more than just correct the mistakes of the first season. It takes the very concept of creating a school idol group and makes it its own. Sure, the entire ordeal is formulaic on paper, but the way it blossoms is just so spectacular and uplifting, its as though its not Love Live at all. Yet at the same time, it is.\\n\\n\r\nAt first glance, the character designs look about the same, with some copied tropes from the previous series (e.g. student council president, the clumsy one, the shy one, the \"futsu no onna\" one, the groper etc.). I'm not gonna surprise you by saying \"OH! BUT THEYRE DIFFERENT!\", no. Essentially, they are different takes on the trope, and this is necessary if Sunshine really wants to tell a new kind of story. What makes these characters stand out and shine on their own is the way they are characterized, and this has a lot to do with the involvement of Muse. It's actually amazing how much influence a group of characters that aren't even there have on the story. In Sunshine, Muse have moved on from singing school girls to living, breathing gods. From the way they're only seen through posters to the way the characters talk about them with revere and divinity. Heck, in one of the episodes, one of the girls sends a fan letter to Honoka (from the first 2 seasons) but it sounds more like a fucking prayer than fan mail. \\n\r\nEssentially, Idol anime are character stories, taking the viewer through the journey of a girl to become the number one star. And while some anime require about a hundred episodes to make a story whole, some only need as few as 13. \\n\r\nSunshine is rich with flavorful characterization, often using visual directing to do most of the talking rather than outright telling. The use of common/cheesy phrases and emphasis of tone help bring out what these girls are, pulling away from the idea that every teenage girl is a dark, wild and emo Chloe Moretz and instead giving the audience something very different. They give them dreams; desires, none poisonous, but awfully human and representative of who the girls are inside and out. From painful outbursts to soft-spoken sympathy, Sunshine embraces the use of imagery and dialogue to tell us who these characters really are without (mostly) words. A girl seeking acceptance taking a stray hand, a girl who hasn't once dreamed of breaking out of her shell witnessing it on a magazine cover, the desire to shine brighter than diamonds with everyone you've met; there are simply so many things to take from these characters, and in only 13 episodes. Sure, it can be lacking at times, but what the series delivered was more than enough. I'm not going to say what exactly was developed and how; that's for you to experience yourself.\\n\r\nSide-characters were also great, but a bit underused. Of course, with idols, you're always going to have competition and just from simply existing, Saint Snow captures that feeling of intimidation almost perfectly. From their music, to the way they walk, they were certainly very captivating, not only in terms of fear for the main cast, but in their outright beauty. The rest of the cast were your supportive sisters and classmates, and were utilized well if to help the series lose that feeling of insularity.\\n\\n\r\nGoing technical, Sunshine not only looks better, is animated better or sounds better. It also FEELS better. It's taken the spirit of Love Live and turned it into something so engrossing and captivating to watch. The short moments on stage are always spectacular, showcasing lots of fluid choreography and outstanding cinematography that puts the original series' efforts to dirt. . While newcomers will be engulfed by the simply beautiful direction of these sequences, old time fans will be welcomed again by the feelings and passionate emotion present in the film or even, dare I say, the Final Live. The music is also fantastic. Every track resembled what was happening at the moment of the series and creates a wholly immersive experience when listening to the tune and lyrics. The best example I can give is Saint Snow's performance, \u300cSelf Control\u300d. It was certainly the most memorable moment in the series, not only in introducing Saint Snow as an idol group or a threat, but as professionals; a pair that knew exactly what they were doing and knew how to do it good. \\n\r\nThe backdrop work and animating are nothing short of ecstatic. There is more fluidity in the character and mouth movements, use of lighting and colors are beautifully done and the sound quality is great. There is simply no reason not to watch this in 1080p, if only to get the full experience of the series. On part of directing outside of character drama, there is a whole slew of hilarious moments. Some great, some just okay but nothing ever a bad joke. The timing of the jokes and delivery are a lot better than in previous seasons, where it was usually out of nowhere or just downright unfunny at times. Slice of Life moments had great presentation, making use of attractive sea-like colors for reflection and energy of the scene, to drive out the boredom. \\n\r\nThis is money very well spent on Sunrise's part. \\n\\n\r\nLove Live! Sunshine!! recaptures the beauty of the original series through different lens and delivers something that exceeded all of my expectations. It is the second series this year that's made me feel so emotionally captivated, enough to make me shed tears. 2016 wasn't so great but with gems like these, any year can be truly memorable. I look forward to whatever Sunrise has in store for the franchise next, or if we're ever getting that Yohane spin-off that's in high demand right now.\\n\\n\r\n8/10\\n",

            "content": "This review includes spoilers up to episode 6, as well as various parts of the original Love Live series.\r\nAfter watching and thoroughly enjoying both seasons and the movie of the original Love Live series, I was excited to start Sunshine and experience a new setting, characters, and story. Unfortunately, after 6 episodes, it has become very clear that there is nothing new to be experienced here.\r\nFirst of all, the characters. They have different names and faces, but make no mistake - they are clones of the girls from the first series. Chika is Honoka, You is Kotori, Riko is Umi, Ruby is Hanayo, Hanamaru isRin, Yoshiko is Nico, Dia is Eli, and Mari is Eli. The only one I can't comment on would be whether Kanan is a Maki clone. She hasn't been shown in much detail up to this point, so it's hard to say. I would be very surprised if she ended up NOT being a clone, though. I could go into detail about how each of these characters end up being a clone of another, but I think if you watch even one episode it will become very clear that this is the case.\\n\\n\r\nNext, the plot. Guess what, it's just copied and pasted from the original series yet again, only done worse. The series starts out with no actual motivation for the girls to become school idols - they just want to. That's weak and uninteresting, but in episode 6 it's revealed that the school is set to be closed due to lack of interest from students. Hey, at least they addressed the lack of motivation for the girls, but they did so by literally reusing the same plot as before!\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that really rubbed me the wrong way in the plot was the girls' first concert. If you remember \u03bc's first concert, the curtain opened to reveal that no one showed up. It was a powerful scene that served the purpose of telling the girls that their goal wouldn't be easy to achieve, and they wouldn't be instantly successful. In fact, this scene is probably my favorite scene in the entire Love Live anime. Sunshine attempts to copy this scene, but it messes it up to an incredible extent. Instead of leaving it at no one showing up and using that to show the girls that it will be hard, it turns out everyone is just late to the concert! It sets a precedent that the girls cannot and will never fail, unlike \u03bc's who actually DID fail on multiple occasions and grew from it. If you're going to copy a scene, at least do it right instead of completely undermining the entire purpose of the scene.\\n\\n\r\nI know some people might be upset because I only watched 6 episodes, but it became very clear to me in those 6 episodes that I was in store for nothing more than a clone of the original series with much worse execution.",

            "content": "First of all, Love Live! Sunshine!! is a show that needs you to pay attention and to understand it, which is kind of interesting considering most of these types of shows are pretty straightforward, but this one needs you to understand the message it starts building up at the very beginning and that it concludes really well. Hopefully this will erase all the misconceptions about this show that you might have seen anywhere else on the internet. I'll have a TL;DR section at the end if any of you wishes to skip the explicit content.\r\nAlso, it is not completely necessary to watch the predecessor series,Love Live! School Idol Project, to watch Sunshine since they follow two different groups, but as a recommendation, you should check it out if you still haven't. It presents references that enhance the experience if you have seen the first series. :)\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nContrary to what some believe, Sunshine!! does not follow the journey of Aqours after its creation, the entirety of this season shows us the background of the group, the reason why it is created, their motivations, the relationships the members develop, why they are different from Muse, etc. This is a much more character driven plot than the one in School Idol Project S1, which was a bit more story driven.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIt follows Chika Takami, a normal high school girl who finds a dream to follow, and that is to shine as a School Idol being influenced by Muse, our protagonist group from Love Live! School Idol Project. Chika creates her School Idol group in Uranohoshi Girls High School, with the goal of being just like Muse and recreating their story, however... will that really wield any good results...?\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe story in Love Live! Sunshine!! is simple and yet needs you to understand it. I'm so tired of the \"Aqours is just a carbon copy of Muse\" thing that makes this show really underrated and that it's been driving me nuts, so let's just get that out of the way first. \\n\\n\r\nSunshine!!  CONSCIOUSLY draws parallels between School Idol Project and Sunshine!! , yes, consciously. They adress this openly and honestly in the anime, Sunshine is intended to reflect and to mirror School Idol Project's setting, just to then get past this comparisons and show us how different the situation is. This is where everything starts to build up, and is at the very beginning of the show, and why? Because the whole message of the show is that \"Aqours is not Muse, and they'll never be\", and \"Be Yourself\". Which is explained and shown later in episodes 8 and 12.\\n\\n\\n\r\n\"Why did they take so long to acknowledge something like that\" you ask? Because the purpose of this show never was to show us Aqours journey right after it is created with all 9 members, but rather to have a season where the torch of the Love Live franchise would be passed from the first generation to the second (done symbolically in episode 12 with Chika catching the feather) and to form the bonds of the members of Aqours. The last shot in episode 13 tells us that the TRUE story of Aqours is beginning now (in the really probable second season and onwards), since the shot replicates the picture that marked the beginning of Love Live! Sunshine!! and Aqours as a multimedia project back in 2015. So, this is the message that the show conveys to us, that they are different, the reasons why they are different, that is important to be yourself and that you can still be influenced by someone but you can walk your own path. \\n\\n\r\nThis is a huge misconception in the franchise so I wanted to get it out of the way first, that Aqours and Sunshine are just blatant carbon copies of its predecessors, trust me, they are not. The show consciously draws this parallels and breaks all the expectations they created in the first half of the show by showing us that they are indeed really different (I'll talk about the characters in the later part). That is the reason why I say this show needs you to pay attention and understand it. This plot point can be seen building up since episode 1, and then reaching its breaking point at a certain episode, which is a complete turning point to the series.\\n\\n\r\nThis first season servers as a set-up season to kick off with Aqours' Love Live story in the future.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nART: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThere's not much to talk about here, an obvious improvement in terms of animation and art compared to the previous TV Anime seasons and that holds a resemblance with the art used on the movie which is just as good. Granted better budget, more to spend on animation and art, but the experience of the animation team clearly shows here too. Art is subjective indeed, so you can like it or dislike it depending on your standards, but it is clean and crisp.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nKind of the same as the art, another improvement which is to be expected since the team has now experience and a bigger budget. The OST has some quite nice tracks that can convey emotions really well.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing to note is how the series captures the sounds of a small and silent seaside town. The squawk of the seagulls, the sound of the waves hitting the shore, it really helps to the immersion and it sounds clean.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of Music and insert songs, is subjective. I like my idol music, so I enjoyed all of the songs, not only here, but on the franchise as a whole. However, Aqours has a distinguishing feature, and is that their singing voices blend together really well and they harmonize a lot. \\n\\n\r\nCoupled with the music and insert songs is the fact that the musical performances are usually linked to character development and plot progression, which is a constant of Love Live that we've seen in previous seasons. So, if you haven't seen it or you thought of them being out of place, I'd recommend you to watch them with subs or look for the lyrics of those songs, since they usually work as an extension or conclusion to a certain topic.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThis. This section is probably the most important besides \"Story\".\\n\\n\r\nLove Live! Sunshine!! is the successor to Love Live! School Idol Project, and Aqours is the successor to Muse, they are part of the same franchise and as such, Dengeki G's Magazine, Sunrise and Lantis need brand continuity to ensure continued profitability and success. This and the fact that they still have the same artist lets us know why are some of the girls similar in design. Is the same as other brands, for example, how the leader of a Power Ranger's team is always a really strong guy, and he becomes the red ranger, this applies the same way here. Similar character archetype and design, yet definitely different characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe girls are intended to be mirrors and reflections of the girls in Muse so people can remember that even though it is a new season, with a new group, it is still Love Live, it is the same franchise, thus, if you come into it looking for similarities in their characters' personalities and design, you will find them on the surface.\\n\\n\r\nHOWEVER, that's all you get, since the show draws parallels between the current cast and the past cast, again, to move past them and then break those expectations and start developing them even further, to the point where they are completely different characters, yet working as a reflection of their predecessors, which is really hard to achieve.  And all of them actually have reasons to act how they do which are shown in each girl's character development episodes. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter development, although there is just a little bit because, again, this is a set-up season, is clean and easy to relate, the drama is well handled and is not forced since all of it has a proper build up, and the character interactions feel natural (except for two characters). Something that helps to this is how the relationships are formed within this group. We have childhood friends in almost every year group, and even between them. We have a pair of sisters as well, etc. All of them, except for Riko, are connected to at least one of the members even before the creation of their group, and it makes sense since they live in a small seaside town, you know that unlike in the big cities, is more likely that most of the population of a small town gets to know each other.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThis kind of story was really enjoyable to me, giving such a nice message of \"Be Yourself\", with a cast of funny eccentric characters while still making them relatable due to the realistic and harsh situations they are put in that will most likely make us cheer for them or feel sympathy towards them if we had experienced it before. If Sunshine was your first entry into the Love Live franchise, I'd kinda bet that you may have enjoyed it as well.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nLove Live! Sunshine!! is a very underated show because it comes after the juggernaut that Muse was (and still is of course), and the huge popularity that they and School Idol Project attained, thus making quite a number of people not wanting to understand it and care for it.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, that is no reason to just blindly hate on it and give it an unfair, superficial judgement. Its story is sweet and simple, yet it has a really deep meaning to it. Its characters are very lovely, enjoyable and relatable, once you get to know them well on the inside, you can see all the development they go through. The music is on point, the drama is very well handled, and my only complaint with the series would be that they wasted a big chunk of the last episode and how it kept forcing Chika and Riko in our faces, overshadowing and throwing aside the rest of the cast, but it still had some nice touching scenes and musical performances.\\n\\n\r\nLooking and analyzing at how it was handled and executed, Sunshine surpasses School Idol Project S1 in almost every aspect, and that's not a bad thing, fellow fans, that's how it should be. With the extra experience and capital the production team has, they are now able to provide better storytelling, better art and animation, better production values on the whole. If they hadn't grow and learn from their mistakes in the past and improved this second time around, it would have been a big failure for the franchise.\\n\\n\r\nThis doesn't mean that you must enjoy one more than the other because it is better made in terms of production, enjoy whatever you want, both series are similar yet different with its own charm, and both are really, really enjoyable. But you should at least acknowledge the effort put into this series to take the anime adaptations of the franchise to a higher level. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: Don't trust all the negative bias and superficial judgement this series has. It shows a story of self-discovery and self-appreciation with characters that are enjoyable, lovely and very different from their predecessors when you get to know them. It is by no means a carbon copy as some call it out to be, and the series shows this with facts throughout its run, addressing this openly and honestly, drawing parallels to its predecessor to then break them all and develop their cast and plot even further, and get past those comparisons as the series advances.\\n",

            "content": "> May contain slight spoilers\r\n> I'm still fairly new to this so pls be gentle.\r\nAh Love Live!, it's good to be back. I missed the friendly bond among the characters, the simple yet endearing story, the colorful and likable cast, and the unforgettable music. Like the original Love Live, Love Live Sunshine has all that. This anime is nostalgia to me, especially the fact that they looked up to Muse, cementing them as legends not only in the Love Live universe but also in my heart. \r\nStory (6/10) :  \r\nAdmittedly, Love Live Sunshine (LLS) is very similar to Love Live School Idol Project (LLSIP)in a lot of ways. The characters are based off of Muse; the story regarding the school as well, the traits and personalities, and a little bit of the looks too. I understand why people may dislike it, why they may want something new. Some would say that if it had an original story it would've been better. I agree to a certain extent but I believe that what we have in Sunshine is just fine. \\n\\n\r\nI also believe Sunshine made use of that foundation better than School Idol Project did-for the most part, at least. I do not dislike the fact that the overall story is similar to SIP. Simply because it is nostalgia to me, and the fact that these girls also looked up to Muse is all the more reason to compliment what is being done in terms of pattern story (if that makes sense). Now it may not seem fair to do that since it is very similar to SIP's original story, but it was clear that they were also going in this direction and I think they did it better.\\n\\n\r\nThe one thing that confuses me though is the ending. Did Aqours win Love Live? I don't really know lol. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation (9/10) :\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is quite spectacular. It is bright, lively and colorful. The background designs are beautiful and it really feels like you're living near the sea. I felt some Nagi no Asukara vibes too. The character designs are pretty and adorable, but nothing new. These girls were inspired by LL SIP so they look alike to a certain degree. The \"antagonist\" of the show (Saint Snow) look interesting. The dark eye colors give off the \"antagonist\" vibe, unlike A-RISE (SIP). The CGI is also significantly better. To sum it up, if there is one word to describe the animation here, it would be \"Sunshine\".\\n\\n\\n\r\nMusic (9/10) :\\n\\n\r\nThe songs are good, but not better than SIP's. Not all of the songs resonated in me. Don't get me wrong, I still loved all of them but nothing really impacted me. The only ones that I really enjoyed are Aozora Jumping Heart, Yume de Yozora o Terashita and Mijuku Dreamer. My favorite Love Live song to date is still START: DASH!! It was fun to hear Yume no Tobira as well. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the voice acting, obviously very well done. The thing with Aqours though is that their individual voices are hard to differentiate. Yes, you can probably tell who is singing a certain part of a song individually (during a solo part), and yes they sound more \"one\" (more harmonious even) when they sing as a group, more so than Muse, but it is hard to tell which voice is which during the those group moments. Muse had powerful and distinguishable voices in both solo and group song parts. This is why I belive that Muse is better than Aqours.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8/10):\\n\\n\r\nAs for Aquors, they were all lovable. It was very easy to like them all in just a few eps. While some characters only got little screen-time (Kanan) or had lesser time as the show progressed (Ruby, You), I still feel like this isn't the show's fault necessartily because its only 13 eps. The most impressive thing for me is that they were able to give them some story in just 1 season. SIP didn't manage to do that as Nozomi and Eli had little time in S1 (compared to the others), Kotori's departure scene was forced, and Umi had not much of a story for herself at all. When you compare it to Sunshine, then Sunshine 'shines' more: Riko's intro and story was well-executed, the 'story-book recruitment' story of Ruby and Hanamura-zura was entertaining, the occultic episode with 'Yohane', the struggles of You, the struggles of Chika and most especially the senpai-arc of Mari, Dia and Kanan-which I believe is the best story arc in any of Love Live. It just had a better story imo. Saint Snow is the weak character link that I don't like though. They didn't feel like a rival, unlike with A-RISE. Maybe its just me. One last small thing, we actually know some other characters here outside of Aqours that provide support to the main cast (relatives, classmates,etc). We didn't get much of that in SIP.\\n\\n\r\nHere's my list of most fave to least fave: Riko, Dia, Mari, Hanamaru, Yoshiko, Ruby, Chika, Kanan, You. This was actually kinda hard because I don't have a clear-cut fave unlike with Maki in SIP. Either way, I didn't really dislike any of them and as usual only the MC got kinda annnoying.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10):\\n\\n\r\nI had a blast. Like I said earlier, this anime was pure nostalgia. It brought back the happy moments and feels that I had with Love Live SIP. It's everything that I wanted and more.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8.4/10):\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation and story- Sunshine was better. Everything else, SIP is. I guess it's not fair because its not an original story but I still feel like it was done better. As of this moment, I feel like Love Live Sunshine is better than Love Live School Idol Project SEASON 1. BUT! I still believe that Muse > Aquors by a mile. That's it for Sunshine! Would definitely listen to their music and watch more should there be an S2 and a movie! Keep shining, Aqours!\\n\\n\r\nTo those who read this review, thank you very much.\\n\r\nThis is my second one, and I hope it was at least remotely helpful.\\n\r\nIf you have yet to see this anime, then I highly recommend it. Although it would be better if you watched Love Live! School Idol Project! first. There won't be a problem if you want to watch this first though, and that may even make for a unique viewing experience.\\n\\n\r\nIf you have finished this anime and maybe trying to find an anime similar to this I recommend K-on! and Idolmaster. I haven't really watched any idol shows outside of the Love Live franchise but these two have been heavily requested to me.\\n\\n\r\nHave a good day! :D",

            "content": "Love Live Sunshine! has ALOT to live up to from the original Love Live, can these new characters be the \"new shiny *cough*\" characters to fill our Love Live cravings...well let's get right into it by talking first about...\r\nThe characters, at best, well LA will pullout LA's notes for this one. BULLETPOINTS TIME!..ohh and some SPOILERS here and there you have been warned\r\n*Chika Takami (voiced by Anju Inami), appearance-wise looks like Rin Hoshizora, has Honoka Kousaka's genkiness and is the character to start it all which also has shades of Honoka.\r\n*You Watanabe (voiced by Shuka Saitou), appearance-wise looks like a short-bobbed Kotori Minami and isalso friends with the main character and wants to get the idol activities started. You parallels Kotori even further as she along with Ruby are costume designers in Aqours as Kotori did in the original. Come her character development episode, she became LA's second favourite character.\\n\r\n*Riko Sakurauchi (voiced by Rikako Aida), appearance-wise is a more longer haired Maki Nishikino and on speaking of Maki, Riko is ALSO a piano player, though Riko's position to Chika is more for Umi Sonoda who does the lyrics for every song, as such Riko is one of the lyricist for Aqours.\\n\r\n*Kanan Matsuura (voiced by Nanaka Suwa), appearance-wise looks like a ponytailed Nozomi Tojo and with that Kanan pretty much embodies Nozomi for the most part (though groping is omitted), her athleticism is also from Rin.\\n\r\n*Dia Kurosawa (voiced by Arisa Komiya) appearance-wise looks a bit like Umi Sonoda, however her personality is completely different with an amalgamation of Eli Ayase (for being the student council president) as well as Nico Yazawa's prideful attitude and Hanayo Koizumi's obsession with idols (though Dia is closeted, her idol obsession, not her prideful attitude). Dia parallels Eli in terms of personality and role as the biggest resistance in forming Aqours, her parallel personality to Eli is even lampshaded at one point.\\n\r\n*Ruby Kurosawa (voiced by Ai Furihata), appearance-wise she's a red-headed vers. of Nico Yazawa but has Hanayo Koizumi's shyness, though her work for needlework pretty much makes her the costume designer for Aqours thus has shades of Kotori Minami, but her personality parallels Hanayo ALOT and is even lampshaded in the series.\\n\r\n*Mari Ohara (voiced by Aina Suzuki) appearance-wise looks like a short-bobbed Eli Ayase (or to be precise a near exact Arisa Ayase, Eli's younger sister with a braid) and Mari even has the mixed descent (Eli being of Russian and Japanese, while Mari of Italian and  Japanese), let's also add in the shades for Eli Ayase as she's has a higher position than Dia (thus giving Mari and Eli the highest position in the student body), lastly she has Nozomi's groping tendencies as well as her personality, she's also the composer of Aqours thus she has shades of Maki.\\n\r\n*Yoshiko Tsushima (voiced by Aika Kobayashi), appearance-wise looks like Umi Sonoda, however her personality is VERY much like Nico Yazawa, though the only things unique about her is her chunni-personality and her extremely bad luck...Yoshiko is actually LA's favourite character from Aqours as besides Yoshiko \"YOHANE\"'s similarity toNico, she is probably the most unique character in Aqours' roster.\\n\r\n*Hanamaru Kunikida (voiced by Kanako Takatsuki)  appearance-wise looks like a longer-haired Hanayo Koizumi, however she has shades of Nozomi Tojo as her family runs a temple like Nozomi. Hanamaru is also the main lyricist of Aqours similar to Umi however Hanamaru's most defining trait of her shyness and self-confidence issues parallels Rin Hoshizora's character development (it's even lampshaded), Hanamaru's parallel to Rin goes deeper as her friendship with Ruby (the Hanayo counterpart), the two even joined Aqours similar to Rin and Hanayo. Finally Hanamaru has a verbal tic similar to Rin (just that Hanamaru uses a variety of Shizuoka verbal tics, while Rin just uses \"~nyan!\".)\\n\\n\r\nWhat LA is trying to say is, this new cast of characters feels like the original Love Live cast members personalities and subtle appearances split and mixed into each other and put into this new cast of Aqours and that really isn't a bad thing, it's liven things up actually. By that even if the character's have shades of the original cast, well guess what, their character and group dynamic were very solid very much like the original cast, the group dynamic helped with especially Chika, You and Riko have some of the best group dynamic together, from their banter to their actions together (aand the obvious yuri undertones throughout the Aquors cast). Outside from Aquors as a group, the individual characters themselves and their developments they personally grow from their own obstacles or griefs, thus as a group they are pretty solid, as individual characters they are of the same caliber as they're group.  \\n\\n\r\nSorry for constantly comparing Sunshine to the original but LA will point out that where the original formed the idol group to save the school, Sunshine on the other hand, Aqours is formed for their own personal growth. If there was something new that Sunshine!! took was the characters motivations, from a Love Live franchise point of view, it's refreshing. As for an idol genre point view, -sigh- iDOLM@STER already did it...\\n\\n\r\nSome of the flaws in this spinoff is that the it has the near same plot beats to the original (from their formation to their idol group to LA's comprehensive character look to their obstacles into forming Aqours), but Love Live Sunshine!! still has it's own flair to make it worthy to it's original even if it uses the same plot beats and somewhat rushed character developments to some of Aqours to the original. The biggest problem with Sunshine is that it places the original season up on a pedestal, thus \"worship and imitates it\", thus it can never surpass or be it's own thing, this is in-universe portrayed through Dia and her resistance to Aqours, thankfully Sunshine became it's own to it's ties to the original season with the homages being nothing but \"Love Live fanservice\" as it did start to focus more on in-characters failures and how they overcome that failure to see it as nothing but a stepping stone to success as well as using previous storyline plot points from the original but even making that their own, really Love Live Sunshine!! just needed a while before it could do it's own thing and stopped fawning over the original cast and thus Sunshine's ties and fangirling to the original cast do sever and becomes it's own and in a more meta-textual way is VERY different from the original series.\\n\\n\r\nQuite simply, it's HOW Sunshine focuses on a certain element in comparison to the original series, the original series was focused more on the \"group\" and \"their goals to save their school\", Sunshine's cast does differently by focusing on it's character's personal problems before facing their failures and the Love Live tournament and yes it's hypocritical that LA noted in LA's character section that Sunshine's cast have personalities and appearances melded together from the original cast, but it's because of the characters having their own struggles instead of the original's \"group goals\". \\n\\n\r\nLA still enjoyed Sunshine even with these flaws as Aqours' in both individual and group dynamic still helped bring in it's bubbly vibe that the Love Live series is known for.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation done by Sunrise as the original series did, well LA has nothing but praise LA can say about the animation, yes even from the integrated CGI dance scenes as it's even more smoothly animated with the traditional animation. The character designs are vibrant and poppy very typical of this franchise and it's even better as there a several background material the characters do while other characters are talking at times, on speaking of which, the backgrounding of the ocean in contrast to the originals cityscape, well that makes Sunshine have a better edge with this kind of scenery scenario. The animation overall was very well done across the board.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of voice acting, we have your typical bubbly moe vocals throughout but it becomes quite obvious who LA's voice actors were, Aika Kobayashi who voiced the eccentric chunni Yoshiko as LA clearly saw that Aika was having soo much fun voicing her and \"getting into character and keeping it up\", she was a barrel of genkiness and aloofness, the other was Shuka Saitou who voiced the ace You, her \"catchphrase and posing\" was memorable and Shuka like Aika embraced her role as You. It's not like these two voice actors were the ONLY best voice actors in this series, the rest of the cast were brilliant and needs praise, sure moe vocals but still.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending was overall satisfying by all means and rounded up the anime quite nicely. By the end of this ending, Sunshine became it's own. Though the \"cliff notes of the entire anime\" as the characters performances were slightly tacky but heartwarming at the same time. The ending was a nice send off to Sunshine and LA actually hopes for a second season as Sunshine has potential to do something entirely different from the original series.\\n\\n\r\nLove Live Sunshine!! had a rather similar start to the original series' plot beats and the obvious similarities to the original characters, but with this rocky start, Sunshine finally opened up into being it's own and quite frankly be different from it's original counterpart, is Sunshine better  or worse than the original series?...well it's up to how you see the Sunshine, LA on the other hand, LA was annoyed by the over-exaggerated homages to the original but still liking Sunshine paying homage to it's original predecessors, but by the halfway mark is when Sunshine really turned into something different instead of being overshadowing and fangirling to it's original and LA is truly thankful for making these new characters though similar in appearance and personality to the original cast, be different both in terms of characters AND plot. Sunshine for LA because of this...isn't better than the original, but can rival it by being different AND still paying homage to it's original.",

            "content": "While Sunshine is a separate anime from first Love Live, there is no way to avoid comparing them. I'd also strongly advise against watching Sunshine if you haven't seen first LL yet.\r\nChronologically, action of this story takes place some time after original one and there are many (too many) mentions of \u00b5\u2019s. It\u2019s clearly aimed at people who already know franchise. This makes main and the most noticeable flaw in this anime even worse: for some reason someone thought it will be a good idea for whole story to follow same plot points as first Love Live. Maybe it was supposed to be some kindof service towards fans, but turned into lazy copy-pasta. One could say that authors simply took skeleton of story and covered it with different girls. To make it funnier, LL story isn\u2019t some masterpiece worth copying. It\u2019s cheesy and predictable - fitting for this show, but also easy to replace with another thing of similar level. Now, if someone actually started with Sunshine, they wouldn\u2019t be bothered by this part, but it\u2019s pretty much a sequel, so that wouldn\u2019t work either.\\n\r\nGenerally speaking, LL Sunshine is much stronger in SoL/CGDCT department than original. As much as I liked \u00b5\u2019s girls, Aqours feel more polished and fitting for anime. Girl\u2019s quirks don\u2019t feel forced or annoying, cast is balanced and, at least for me, there are no obvious best and worst girls.We also get a lot more (and funnier) comedy, great reaction faces and meme worthy moments.\\n\r\nSadly, nothing is perfect. What Sunshine gained in comedy and cuteness, it lost in drama and idol focus. While the problems that girls have to overcome aren\u2019t what I\u2019d call \u201cforced drama\u201d, they aren\u2019t that good or deep either. Another thing this anime didn\u2019t deliver is this feeling of overcoming odds and doing the impossible. Yes, they keep talking about making miracles and stuff, but it just doesn\u2019t have the bang original had, it lacks the inspiring feeling I got when watching \u00b5\u2019s.\\n\r\nWhen talking about Love Live, obvious topic to discuss is music. Let me say that, despite playing School Idol Festival mobage, I\u2019m not really a fan of \u00b5\u2019s music. From Aqours songs I\u2019ve heard so far, personally, I like them more. On the other hand, they are all just nice, while first LL had few of those \u201cspecial\u201d songs that were way above others. Obviously it's matter of preferences, but for me it feels like Aqours' music, despite generally sounding better, lack some kick.\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr: if you are here for idols, you might be disappointed compared to first LL anime. But if you also like cute girls SoLs, then you probably will like it.\\n",

            "content": "For context, I wanted to love this show. Genuinely, Love Live! School Idol Project! is my favourite anime. It is so far the only anime which has made me cry... multiple times. I was hoping for the same sort of experience with Sunshine, and I kid you not, actually abandoned the show halfway trough the first episode. I was already losing faith in the show at this point, but Mari\u2019s first line was in such broken Japanese that I couldn\u2019t bear it. It took me a few weeks to decide to give Sunshine another watch, only to again drop the show due to Mari, specificallythe infamous \u201cIt\u2019s joke\u201d scene. She defies explainantion! Her English is horrible and her Japanese isn\u2019t that much better, bringing in the question as to how she communicates with other people. I finally rejoined the show again and made it through episode 12 when I realised I would never like the show and abandoned it.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s taken me quite a while, but I realised why I instantly connected with Honoka in School Idol Project. After a pretty catchy prelude, episode 1 of School Idol Project literally begins with \u2018Hi, I\u2019m Honoka, oh no my school is going to be shut down, I have to do something!!!\u2019 Her goal wasn\u2019t fame or notability, it was to save the school that was so deeply engrained in her family. Not to mention that Honoka fails. She works her butt off to make Muse\u2019s first little concert happen and nobody showed up to it except for core characters, which acted as the catalyst for their inevitable union.\\n\r\nContrast this with Sunshine\u2019s opening. Chika is immediately met with the world of school idols and is entranced by it. She wants the fame, but doesn\u2019t understand what actually drove Muse. Aqours\u2019 first concert was also a raging success, which kind of took away from Dia\u2019s words. When Eli criticised Honoka in SIP, it\u2019s powerful because despite the horrible failure she just endured, Honoka proves she is not willing to give up. Dia criticises Chika in a very similar way, but the scene loses its significance when the crowd is packed.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that greatly put me off Sunshine was the characters. If I\u2019m honest, I could probably write down the character traits of Muse members on strips of paper, shuffle a few around a tiny bit, and end up with pretty accurate descriptions of Aqours members. Unfortunately, Sunshine also added extra character traits that just make the characters downright annoying. While I certainly liked some characters in School Idol Project better than others, I never once hated any of the characters. With Sunshine, I only liked 2 characters; Ruby because I like cuteness, and You because she really is a jack of all trades. However, I also have hatred towards 2 of the main characters; Mari and Yoshiko. Mari steals the \u2018rich girl\u2019 title from Maki, the desire to grope the other girls from Nozomi, and has the worst voice of all of Aqours. It is almost exactly like nails on a chalkboard, complete with sharp screeches. Yoshiko, on the other hand, suffers from chronic chuunibyou (8 grade syndrome) which leaves her believing she is a \u201cfallen angel\u201d named Yohane. In all honesty, I like chuunibyou as a concept and I actually fell victim to it when I was, fittingly, in 8th grade. Love, Chunibyo, and Other Delusions pulled the idea off incredibly. Yoshiko is just out of place and much more annoying to the point where I can\u2019t stand her. The other characters are decent, but they none of the Aqours members hold a flame to Muse\u2019s members.\\n\\n\r\nWith the gorgeous animation and interesting small town setting, I\u2019m disappointed that I could never get into Sunshine. I wanted more of the emotions that School Idol Project gave me and held Sunshine to that standard. In fact, I likely would have enjoyed this show if the writers never called back to Muse. If they separated the two, I would have as well. It\u2019s because of all of the callbacks to Muse that I find myself comparing these two shows; one that repeatedly caused me to cry and another that was just too similar.",

            "content": "Love Live Sunshine is the successor to the popular Love Live, which recently ended with a movie. This continuation to the series really got me excited, since love live is one those anime that I don\u2019t get tired or re-watching (I probably re-watch it twice a year or so.) and also at some point I religiously played the mobile game every single day. But still, in the end, little by little I got disappointed of the show throughout the season. Spoilers ahead for those who haven't finish them yet.\r\nThe dialogue of the characters isn\u2019t well thought out. It\u2019s basically them spouting memes non-stop hoping thatsome of them will stick as much as the infamous nico nico nii. Seriously,Hanamaru went from somewhat shy bookworm to just simply saying zura and mirai most of her dialogue. There\u2019s also the part where she\u2019s just stuffing her face with the noppo bread in the background most of the time just to fill the advertisement quota. \\n\\n\r\nThe way they recruit their members feels forced, this got painful for me to watch when Yoshiko joined in specific. The setting is somewhat a rehash to the first LL the way I see it. There\u2019s too many to point out but the point is that they basically just used the same plot points, which seems like lazy writing. The only part where it felt original was the third year drama.\\n\\n\r\nThe most annoying part that really irked me is the constant mention of \u03bc\u2019s. I feel like they mention them too much, mentioning them a few times is okay and all but mentioning them literally all episodes except the last one is a little bit too much.\\n\\n\r\nShould you watch it because you\u2019re a Love Live fan? Sure why not. Overall it\u2019s not that bad of a show, I still enjoyed watching it on time every week, but I felt like they could do better, since the characters and the songs are pretty solid. But I guess to me this feels like more a last minute cashgrab to pander to the hardcore love live fans.\\n",

            "content": "I had very mixed feelings when I heard Love Live would be starting again with a new cast of characters. Muse had finally gotten to the point where each member had earned their place, and while it made sense for their story to end, I always felt a desire for more. I wanted it to be the beginning rather than the ending. \r\nLove Live Sunshine may not have been the beginning I wanted, but it is hardly a weak addition to the series. It does many of the things that made the original series so special, and more than justifies its own existence. I'm gladit exists, and am without any doubt looking forward to seeing more of Aquors.\\n\\n\r\nBut Sunshine isn't without issues. It follows the footprints of the original series a bit too closely-- the flaws and missteps of its first half included and ever more so apparent.\\n\\n\r\nSunshine, like the first season of the original, moves too fast and swims a bit too deep in the drama, rather than giving the audience the main thing they are looking for: reason to like and care for the girls. It sets a nice stage for the inevitable second season, but at the same time, it's hard to not feel a little bit bummed out when Sunshine starts with the same stumbles rather than learning from the original's excellent second season. If it sounds like I am being a harsh critic, you may be right, but part of that is because I have a strong attachment to the original series and want to see its successor reach the same highs. If it can't, wouldn't it be reasonable to lament that there is not just more Muse instead?\\n\\n\r\nSunshine actually does a pretty admirable job with its drama. It never aims to be something more or different from what it truly is, and what is there is handled with meaning and clarity-- even if its themes are something we have heard a hundred times before-- and its bittersweet and well-timed background music consistently amplifies its message. Sunshine's heart is in the right place. The problem is just that there is just too much of this drama, too soon. Assuming there is to be more of Aquors (and I will bet my non-existent heart that there will be), the climax of their story is not now, but then. This isn't the time to bring them on the big stage, but to prepare them for it. They aren't ready, and neither is their audience.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Nico's \"Nico Nico-nii\" catchphrase was silly (and adorable), the original series did not ever attempt to paint that as a genuine part of her character; it was a joke even to herself, and entirely contrary to her personality. Yoshiko, and to a lesser extent, Mari and Hanamaru, are defined to varying extents by these sorts of catchphrases, without the same sort of depth or rationale to it that Nico's character had. Some may find Yoshiko's terminal autism to be amusing (and indeed it can be!), but these sorts of gimmicks do little else but make them feel somewhat artificial, at times even empty. And empty is the last thing a character from Love Live should be.\\n\\n\r\nBut nine main characters is a lot to deal with in only thirteen episodes. The original series had yet to accomplish the same by that point, so, I suppose, it is only fair to expect Sunshine will also start hitting those strides from here on. Most of the girls (particularly Ruby) are cute and interesting enough in their own right, even if they have done little yet to stand out from the more outgoing characters. I'm just worried that Sunshine has turned Yoshiko into such a joke that there may be no way of ever doing anything meaningful with her character. Making a serious character into a joke is an easy thing, but a joke into a real character is a much harder process. \\n\\n\r\nAquor's rival group, Saint Snow, is certainly more interesting than the original's counterpart. Ria and Seira aren't successful because they are 'perfect' idols, but rather because they have their own unique thing going on. There's a neat contrast between the traditional, idol-y nature of Aquors, and Saint Snow's more eclectic Babymetal leanings. Ria and Seira have reason to be hostile-- Aquors is the exact opposite of what they want to be.\\n\\n\r\nIf you were to ask me why I have spent so much time comparing Sunshine to the original series, rather than discussing it solely on its own merits, it is because Sunshine itself does so on a regular basis. It doesn't try or even want to disconnect itself, and instead recognises and pays respect to Muse. The girls of Aquors started their group precisely because they were fans of Muse. It's the appropriate turn to take the franchise; if it attempted to be entirely its own thing, never making a reference to the original, it would feel a bit distasteful, considering just how similar a road the two shows travel. The only troubling part of it all is that it makes you long for Muse all the more. \\n\\n\r\nSunshine continues the tradition of having some of the best music in the entire idol industry. I would argue that songs like \"Todokanai Hoshi datoshitemo\" and \"Kimi no Kokoro wa Kagaiyaiteru kai?\" are better than most of what real idol groups (Momoiro Clover et al.) produce. There may not be any real bangers like Start:Dash or Snow Halation, but I do find Aquors sneaking their way onto my playlist every now and then, too. Ruby's voice also may not be quite as lovely as Nico's or Kotori's, but she's still hella cute regardless.\\n\\n\r\nIf it weren't being compared to its predecessor, Love Live Sunshine would still be one of the best idol anime produced. I have no problem with it, stumbles and tumbles aside, and can see both Love Live fans and newcomers to the franchise having a great time with it. \\n\\n\r\nAquors just have yet to convince me that they are capable of standing on the same stage that Muse once did. I'm open to being convinced otherwise-- heck, I want, and I expect to be convinced otherwise. There are certainly worse ways to start.",

            "content": "Last year, we were told that \u03bc's had come to an end and a PV of the new LL! idol group was shown. Their name is Aqours. They are going to continue on the \u03bc's legacy and (try to) become more successful than \u03bc's. They are namely, Chika, Riko, You, Ruby, Yoshiko (or Yohane whichever preferred), Hanamaru, Dia, Mari and Kanan. I had indifferent opinions about them at first. I didn't delve too deep like how I did during the \u03bc's era to be honest. None of them interested me because the brand new LL!Sunshine!! project was too rushed, where \u03bc's was still around andhad their movie and their Final Live concert upcoming. While the news gave a slap to all the LL! fans, most of us started to worry if Aqours could do better than their predecessors.\\n\\n\r\nNow that it comes to an end with its finale being aired last night. Let's go!\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nNote: In LL!, story, is NEVER ever the selling point. Same goes to LLSS!!.\\n\\n\r\nReusing and referencing the good ol' stuff from \u03bc's isn't a bad thing if the series is executed well. As a fan of the original LL! I sincerely hope that LLSS!! is better, or at least on par, with the original. Surely, the beginning looked promising and didn't disappoint me, and the rest of the series didn't either. A good beginning makes a good ending, eh? Not happening in LLSS!!, unfortunately.\\n\\n\r\nI am here just going to say, the ending... is not meant for everyone. The way the series ended was, not something I will rate 1/10 but still, bad. It could be done better but man, imagine you are sitting on the LLSS!! hype train all along the journey just to reach a cliff and everything goes downhill and bam.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOne thing you can never complain in LL! and LLSS!! is their art. It's really good, and the art improves so much coming to LLSS!!. (tho the CG dance may be pretty annoying from time to time)\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nFor OP, OST and ED, they are really good. VAs did their amazing work too.\\n\\n\r\nMy only concern goes to the inserts. They ARE good, but not impacting enough in their respective episodes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI have a mixed feeling about the characters itself. 3rd years' (Mari, Kanan, Dia) chemistry is great even though I am not a fan of either one of them. 1st years (Ruby, Hanamaru, Yoshiko) did a great job too though I never like Yoshiko (sorry but chuuni isn't to my liking). 2nd years (Chika, You, Riko) tho, they have the same problem as \u03bc's (Kotori, Honoka, Umi) had. There's too much focus for them, and they aren't that great either.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI swear I really enjoy everything up to the 12th episode, but the finale is.... wew. Let's not talk about the weird skit which I think it's actually okay-ish, I am disappointed by the absence of \"Step ZERO to ONE\" after being referenced so much in the anime. The question \"Why do you not perform it and instead using a new song that doesn't give that much impact as a finale?\" will always be in my head from now on.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10 (Revised score: 8/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe series is good, but nowhere better than the original LL! first season imo. \\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: A good start, with a badly executed ending.",

            "content": "Love Live is back with another fresh cast of characters who, let's be real here, are all waifu-worthy judging by their looks alone. I myself was skeptical at first, incredibly worried this may be a case of \"milking the cash cow\". Thankfully, no. Sunshine has even surpassed the first season of the original Love Live in my eyes. Honestly, I'm quite surprised with the outcome.\r\nSunshine starts off with a story that sounds undeniably similar to that of the original. Let me clarify-- it's not an exact story copy. I'd say only the base, its starting point, is the same. We won't, for instance, see ourlovely Nico look-a-like in the same kind of situation as the real Nico. The girls of Aqours each have their own story to tell.\\n\\n\r\nIt certainly is hard to make a good anime with this many main characters in such a short amount of time. Love Live Sunshine is no different. Just like its predecessor, the girls did not receive an enormous amount of development. What do you expect from a show with nine main characters and just thirteen episodes? Things could've been handled differently. Sunshine, unfortunately, repeats the same mistakes. A future second season would set things straight, probably, though. Yes, again, similar to the original. Then, why did I give Sunshine a much higher rating? I'll get to that in a bit.\\n\\n\r\nI don't blame anyone with a huge attachment to Muse to doubt the new series, with the introduction of complete new characters. Aware of that, though, I think they should still give Aqours a chance, a chance to shine. And, it sure did shine. Sunshine's cast is a whole lot more likeable and memorable than its predecessor. I had an easy time liking the characters, and even sympathized with them during emotional scenes-- even if I didn't like them one bit initially. Mari and You, just to note a few examples. The new girls are what made Sunshine so much better for me personally.\\n\\n\r\nTalking a little about my favorites; Chika, pretty much an exact copy of Honoka, the side-ponytail being the only difference. I'm quite fond of her positiveness and leadership ability, and basically being the driving force of the group. Honoka was one of my personal favorites from Muse-- it wouldn't be that strange to have Chika as one of my favorite Aqours girl as well. Hanamaru, or rather Zuramaru as I like to call her, is a fun character, too. Not only is her lack of tech knowledge humorous, her zura's are also very charming. \"It's the future, zura!\" The girls each have their own quirks, some which may be irritating, and some that are genuinely fun. The one character with a disturbing amount of annoyance, though, is Yoshiko. She reminds me of that one Chuunibyou show I didn't like very much. Yoshiko comes over as obnoxious, and feels completely out of place. I'd much rather have a different girl in her stead. Oh well, it can't be helped.\\n\\n\r\nWhat's more disappointing is the fact that a couple did not receive the screen time they deserved. And by that, I'm actually mostly referring to a certain blue haired, ponytailed goddess. She had so little screen time in the first half of the show, I was starting to question whether or not she'll become a member of Aqours later. I guess that beach episode made up for it... uh, just a little bit. Kanan is a fine-looking lady for sure!\\n\\n\r\nWho is the real star of Aqours? The girl - who coincidentally looks a lot like Nico - with the gorgeous red twintails and aqua eyes, of course! Her name is Ruby, the one who invented cuteness and has the voice of an angel. She certainly stands out the most with her design, cute expressions and such. She made her debut in the first episode unlike the Nico. Ruby has already accumulated quite a reputation by just a couple scenes alone-- and now that I think about it, the show needed more of those. The more we got to the end, the less Ruby we got. Though, I was honestly not that upset about it. It indicates how much I actually liked Sunshine, even with the absence of Ruby in the latter episodes. Keep staying unbearably cute, it makes my life so much better. I am keeping this short, since I do not want this to turn into a Ruby love post. (I love her.)\\n\\n\r\nNow, I do have to mention that none of the new characters have been able to completely fill the gap that's been left behind by Nico. Ruby, though, is the cutest in the whole wide world and tries her absolute \"Rubesty\" to make up for it. Her efforts, however, were in vain. I still missed hearing the phrase \"Nico-Nico nii,\" but, oh well, I guess \"Ganbaruby\" is a decent enough replacement. I kind of go a little crazy whenever Ruby says it.\\n\\n\r\nSomething that was quite bothersome was that there was no audition process of sorts going on. Chika was captivated by the beauty of this natural wonder, named Ruby. She got an invitation right on the spot. Apparently, looking gorgeous and cute is all that's needed for one to become a true school idol. Singing and dancing skills are irrelevant. Seriously though, this part has been ignored, yet again.\\n\\n\r\nNotable are the outstanding visuals, a huge improvement over the original. The show is very colorful and the background sceneries are very pretty, especially the seaside ones. And yes, there's still the use of 3DCGI during live performances. However, in Sunshine, it's less distracting, more fluid, and should now be on a tolerable level, which makes it more enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is what you would expect from the Love Live series. The musical performances are outstanding and definitely worthy of praise. The hardships the girls went through, following their dreams-- you can actually feel the emotions they put into their songs. Mirai Ticket, sung in the final episode, is especially a good example. The vocals are great and the voices of all Aqours girls fit well with each other, not to mention the regular voice acting is admirable, too. Have I already mentioned Ruby's angelic voice? Great background music as well.\\n\\n\r\nIf you had any doubts about Sunshine, I can assure you, there is little to worry about. It's certainly an enjoyable show for fans and newcomers alike. Just remember that Ruby is best. I'm very disappointed, though, that the anime did not learn from its past mistakes. Sunshine has the potential of being exceptionally good. And seeing as how popular the Love Live franchise is (especially in Japan!), it will surely get a second season in order to make that happen, and flesh out the characters a bit more. I look forward to the day I see my lovely Ruby animated again.\\n\\n\r\n\"Let's change that zero into a one!\"",

Well, then you've seen Love Live Sunshine too, without even knowing.\r\n- Plot: \r\nThe plot is badly copied from the first Love Live. Sunshine is made basically just to milk the cow and to make fanboys scream of joy cause now they can ship more idols and make more memes about it.\r\nThe story is often slow-paced when nothing is happening and it's light speed fast when it comes to interesting moments. Indeed it's like everything happens behind the scenes while you're not watching and along the anime you're probably gonna ask yourself \"How?\" more often than you wouldexpect. Also, most of the useless and casual stuff that happen is very predictable and clich\u00e9.\\n\r\nIn general it feels like creators had in mind how cool moments should have happened but they didn't know how to arrive to them.\\n\\n\r\n- Characters:\\n\r\nGenerally characters have no defined personality, like if they ran out of stereotypes so they made them as plain and vague as possible just to make everyone happy. Rather than taking the opportunity to do something good, events that should help you knowing the characters a bit deeper happen in dumb funny ways.\\n\\n\r\n- Animation and art:\\n\r\nCharacters pretty much look as if they were from \u03bc's but with different hair and eye colors. The animation is decent even if there's still CGI in some parts of dancing scenes, like in Love Live.\\n\\n\r\n- Sound:\\n\r\nI really like \u03bc'sic and I pretty much like Aqours songs too, it's the only good point of this anime.",

Anyways, watch as these 9 girls, who not only copied the characteristics of their predecessors but even copied their damn grades, try to become the best that no one ever was\u2026\r\nSounds like the type of tale that willget your heart pumping, right?

I personally got the double combo, which means I don\u2019t have much time to live. Let\u2019s list pros and cons before I perish, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nExcept there\u2019s like no pros.\\n\\n\r\nDid Sunshine improve on anything over School Idol Project? LOL no. Nothing about Sunshine is better or probably even on par to School Idol Project. Even so, Sunshine did shower the community with glorious memes, and I\u2019m serious, these memes will give you terminal illnesses in all the right ways. While nowhere near as deep as the ones in School Idol Project (who weren\u2019t even that deep to begin with), the characters in Sunshine are super quirky and gimmicky to the point where they were still very amusing. Despite their lack of substantial substance, they are indeed entertaining\u2026 most of the time. Let\u2019s do a comparison.\\n\\n\r\nThe most common comparison I see is Eri X Nozomi and Mari X Dia. Eri-chi was a killjoy, and I didn\u2019t like her at the beginning, yet she also had a very respectable reason behind her cockblocking, and in the end she was ultimately a very positive experience for Muse. The influence of a professional dancer motivated Honoka to get off her ass and take her idol passion much more seriously. Nozomi secretly supported Muse, but didn't do it in a way that undermined Eri's efforts. Unlike Mari. What did Mari do? Mari is definitely more than just a JOKE :3, she\u2019s actually pretty deep. But unlike Nozomi, she was extremely one-sided in supporting Aqours and didn't show shred of subtlety, putting Dia and Kanan into awkward situations. This does make her somewhat of a more realistic character though. Dia played the role of Eri, but unlike Eri, she didn't have that reality jarring impact on Aqours. In fact, the characters in Sunshine that really drilled the seriousness of being an idol was a rival group introduced in the second half of the show! Ain\u2019t that great?\\n\\n\r\nAnother easy comparison is Nico Nico Nii and the Fallen Angel Yohane. Both are kind of like \u201cjoke\u201d characters, except there\u2019s one big difference between the two. Nico is also more than a joke character. She\u2019s super condescending and was also kind of a cockblock like Eri, but she also contributed a lot more to the overall growth of Muse. Much like Eri, Nico cemented the fact that Muse was a serious idol group, and that they were basically aiming to be professionals. What did Yohane do? She showed that Aqours has a high tolerance for retardation. She also\u2026 uh\u2026 has a lot of funny faces? You can easily take a screenshot of her face and turn it into a reactionary meme. While Yohane is pretty likable, she's probably the least well written in terms of development. \\n\\n\r\nThere are also characters that many people say are essentially copied and pasted. The main character of Sunshine, Chika, is literally just Honoka 2.0. Riko is just two School Idol Project characters in one, Maki and Umi. \\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s also You and ZURAMARU, who kind of act like supports for Chika and Ruby respectively. They are also my favorite characters of the series. Despite usually just being there to push their respective girlfriends on and giving them moral support, they actually ended up being much more likable in my eyes. Zuramaru in particular had a very heartwarming scene where she pushed Ruby on to become an idol, for that was what Ruby always wanted. It had a sense of accomplishment, yet also melancholy, for it felt like Zuramaru accomplished the very thing her character was created for in the first place. So what was the need for her? Indeed, the story then turns her into a comedic sidekick type of character, which despite being detrimental in the long run, it ended up being all good cause she\u2019s adorable af. You kept up her relevance throughout the series because Chika was the main character, so of course they would focus on her more. Even so, You was pretty passive in her support of Chika, and instead of pushing her on with ultra positivity like Kotori or being on top of things like Umi, You kinda just follows Chika around. None of the characters really push Chika on. They kinda just sit there and eventually Chika realizes what she should do, and everyone does a totally heterosexual group hug or something. There's Riko, who actually gets supported more than she supports. She goes through a very similar situation to Kotori, as well as Mari. There's Dia, who serves as the first cockblock out of many, who started off as a clean copy of Eri, imouto and all. She then turns into another Umi right after. There\u2019s also Kanan, who at first was an even bigger cockblock than Eri-chi could ever be, only to be revealed as a very good human being who only cared for Mari\u2019s future. She basically pulled a Hachiman/Homura and became a cockblock for the sake of others. SHE\u2019S BATMAN!\\n\\n\r\nSunshine had some moments though. It was pretty funny once in a while, although the humor is super forced at times, and the drama was pretty impactful some of the time, even though it was way too sappy. Losing sucks. The damn music scene is competitive as fuck. I should know, I\u2019m a songwriter after all. It\u2019s also basically two idol stories in one. You nerds can get double the sappiness. The story about the original 3 school idols was honestly better than anything related to Aqours. Also, at like the end of the season, Aqours stopped comparing themselves to Muse. I\u2019m hoping for a Muse comparison free season 2! Or even better, a season 2 with Muse in it! The music is on par to School Idol Project I guess, although I don\u2019t even like idol music. The ED is catchy though. Uh, what else is good? Yohane has nice legs. Um, Ruby dabs at some point. There\u2019s also BABY ZURAMARU!\\n\\n\r\nLong story short, Sunshine is basically season one of School Idol Project cut in half. It isn\u2019t really about Aqours becoming an idol group, it\u2019s about how Chika\u2019s journey in trying to form an idol group changes those around her for good. That\u2019s exactly what School Idol Project was like, Honoka\u2019s dedication pulling the heartstrings of those around her. The thing is, get this, School Idol Project is ALSO about Muse becoming an idol group! It focuses on the development of Muse as much as it does on the development of the characters. Sunshine only focused on the characters and didn\u2019t even do that as well as School Idol Project did. Maybe it\u2019s cause Sunshine needs a goddamn season 2, but simply being comparable to the first season of School Idol Project ain't so good, cause the first season was pretty SHIT.\\n\\n\r\nBut at least we get more memes and shitty character designs!\\n\\n\r\nOh yes, ranking the girls. From best to worst...\\n\\n\r\n(Keep in mind that for the most part, I like all the characters)\\n\\n\r\n Yousoro > Rick > Hannahmahroo > Autism 101 > Honk 2.0 > Kananyounot? > I wanna Dia > Mary > Gangstarooby\\n\\n",

            "content": "It would have been so easy for them to make this anime good. However, Sunshine takes what made the original series so magical and throws it out the window. If you've seen the original Love Live series, you probably shouldn't watch Sunshine. If you haven't... maybe you'll find something enjoyable in it? This review will contain spoilers for the original series, though, as you're supposed to have seen it already.\r\nFirst, I should admit that the animation is amazing. It's definitely a step up from the original series, and you can see proof of that in the very first episode. That doesn't stop it from havingCGI dance sequences, though. The only one that was fully hand-drawn was the performance by the \"rival\" idol group that is only relevant for about one episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is also amazing. As much as I love Muse, Aqours just has better singers. However, some songs do tend to bleed together. Yume de Yozora wo Terashitai sounds very similar to Mijuku DREAMER, for example. However, there is a fatal problem related to the music, which I'll go into in a little bit.\\n\\n\r\nNow that I've talked about the good aspects of this series, it's time to talk about what killed it: the writing. Unlike in the original series, the MC here has no particular reason for becoming a school idol - whereas Honoka wanted to save the school, Chika wanted to be an idol for its own sake (a realization that took Honoka a long time to have). I have no problem with this - though it does make Kimeta yo Hand in Hand (the Susume->Tomorrow of Sunshine) lose a lot of impact.\\n\\n\r\nBut wait! There is a reason! Several episodes in, we learn that - *gasp* - the school is in danger. And this is when the problems with this series start to really show themselves. Simply put, Aqours is a bunch of Muse fangirls. They could hardly go a single episode without making a reference to them, and they were even HAPPY when they heard the bad news about their school - because now they could be more like Muse. This series lives in Muse's shadow and never really steps out of it.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Muse, let's take a moment and remember why we loved that series. The original Love Live anime was a story of nine girls pouring in blood, sweat, and tears to protect the school that their families have been attending for generations. Then they poured in blood, sweat, and tears to be the best idols they could be. Then, once they were standing on top of the world, they poured in blood, sweat, and tears to ensure that school idols would live on forever.\\n\\n\r\nNotice how much I said \"blood, sweat, and tears.\" There were countless scenes of the characters practicing their dancing, worrying about costumes, asking Eli to coach them, and so on. We saw all the effort they put into their activities, which made their successes all the more rewarding. Sunshine has... maybe two practice scenes? There was one in episode eleven, and I think there might have been one or two brief ones earlier. The original series used the practice scenes for character development (and the performances, which I'll get to in a second), while Sunshine does character development in other ways. Which is fine, but we still need to see the girls practice. When their performances happen, they don't feel believable. It doesn't feel like they've earned it.\\n\\n\r\nAND speaking of the performances, let's talk about why the ones in Sunshine were disappointing. In the original series, most of the performances (not quite all, but nearly all) were situated within the context of the anime. It was \"okay, we're going to perform now,\" and then they performed. In season one, the only one that wasn't like this was Susume->Tomorrow. Since context was given for these performances, we knew that they were actually happening. We could focus on the lyrics - which were ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY, as they often served to summarize or even develop the characters' feelings up until that moment. Who can forget the moment when Honoka, Umi, and Kotori performed START:DASH!! in an empty auditorium? Who can forget the moment when Rin led the team in performing Love wing bell? Not only did we see the characters earn their performances (as discussed above), but we also saw how their performances affected them.\\n\\n\r\nIn Sunshine, three of the six insert songs are just kinda... shoved in there. With no context. Even the movie had little segues into Hello, Hoshi wo Kazoete and ?<-HEARTBEAT. But Sunshine just plops the characters into stage outfits and shows them performing in some random place. We have no way of knowing if they're actually happening in-universe. How, then, are we supposed to take them seriously? Why are we supposed to care?\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair, episode eleven of Sunshine is good. We see the girls practice, we see their feelings develop over the course of the episode, and the insert song is rooted in the context of the story. Plus, its lyrics are extremely relevant to the characters' feelings. It felt like classic Love Live. It made me wish we'd been getting that all season.\\n\\n\r\nOh, I haven't even gotten to the writing yet. The writing is... man, I wish I could say it was good. But it wasn't. I talked earlier about the \"save the school\" plot being reused. I can't say I'm entirely opposed to it, but I feel like it would only have worked if they had been up-front about it. Bring it up in episode one. Don't fake us out and make us think you might be doing something different. But anyway! The constant references to Muse get old really quick. They happened so often that I thought they were set-up for a \"we need to step out of their shadow and be our own group\" realization, but that never happened.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then there's the third-year subplot. This permeates the first half of the series, eventually being resolved in episode nine, and the tone is unreal. It feels very gloomy and depressing - very strange for Love Live. The rest of the time, the show's tone is exactly what you'd expect from a Love Live anime, and the juxtaposition is jarring and rough. It feels like the plot to a late-night drama got mixed into the happy, fun idol show. And when this subplot does get resolved, the reasoning behind the offending character's actions is very flimsy, hard to believe, and - frankly - insulting. When it was first revealed, my reaction was, \"They expect me to buy this?\" It left a lot of actions unexplained, it blatantly contradicted plenty of other scenes we'd seen in earlier episodes, and it just reeked of bad writing. And then, in the very next episode, Chika does the exact thing that this subplot condemned - and gets rewarded for it!\\n\\n\r\nOh, and let's not forget the yuribait. It was very heavy. In fact, I'm not sure it can even be called \"bait.\" It was just plain old yuri (that never ended up going anywhere). Don't get me wrong - I love yuri. I own eight NicoMaki doujinshi. But it didn't add anything to Sunshine. The involved characters didn't gain any development, and the yuri never went beyond one line at the end of episode ten. A line that, might I add, would be the precursor to a romantic subplot in just about any other anime. It felt like they were trying to pander to fudanshi in the same way that they were pandering to Muse nostalgia for the rest of the series. I was, again, kind of insulted that they thought we'd buy it if they splashed a little yuri in there somewhere.\\n\\n\r\nThen good things spontaneously start happening for our characters for no reason, as they'd only canonically had two performances so far (one of which was a local event, the other of which was a flop). And half of episode thirteen is dedicated to a recap of the season. No, seriously. And this recap illustrates all the things I've been talking about. They never really earned any of the popularity they got at any point in the series. There never really was a good reason for Yohane to join the group - they even glossed over it in the recap. And there never really was any reason to care about the group's successes and failures.\\n\\n\r\nI really wanted to like this anime. At first, I figured it could never live up to the legacy of the original series, but I decided to give it a fair chance. And I realized that my original misgivings were right on the money. Sunshine was plagued by bad writing, meaningless performances, and nervous desperation as it tried to simultaneously lean on Muse for support and ignore the secrets to Muse's success.\\n\\n\r\nMy final rating for Love Live! School idol project Sunshine!! is a four out of ten.\\n\\n\r\nOh dear lord this review is long. If you've read this far, thanks.",

            "content": "Following up on such a well loved series is no simple task. Whether they're big fans of the original or never liked the series in the first place there's always going to be skeptics who throw around generic phrases like 'milking the cash cow' when an anime studio so much as thinks of continuing a popular series. Sometimes you can win them over, but most of the time they like to stubbornly stick by their viewpoints even it goes against all logical thinking. But regardless of how baffling I find the point of view that these people have, I'm not here to talk about themor the fan reaction to this series. I'm not here to make comparisons to the original series either. I'm here to talk about the series.\\n\\n\r\nLove Live Sunshine is a continuation of the original series which I loved very much. But I think Sunshine has its own set of unique strengths. Some have even argued that these strengths make it a better series than the original. But what I find great about Sunshine is that its good points don't detract from what made the original series great. It's a fantastic series that stands out on its own merits. I feel like slovenly comparing the two in that way doesn't do either series justice. As such, I will refrain from making comparisons to the original unless I feel it's absolutely necessary.\\n\\n\r\nChika Takami is a normal girl wasting away her days going through the motions like any other high school girl. But she's no longer content with living that kind of life.  When she sees \u00b5's on the big screen of the UTX building in Akihabara (Which I've just recently found out is called the 'UDX' building in real life. Pretty cool huh?) something in her mind clicks. She's finally found a way to break the mould and escape her normal everyday life. That's the basic setup at least. Obviously their journey isn't as easy as it initially seems, but what makes Sunshine uniquely interesting is the nature of the potholes on their road to success. Pretty much everyone who heard \u00b5's was on their side. It was just a matter of getting people to hear them out. As is natural for a series of that nature there are complications along the way but they're mostly irrelevant to how the people react to their music. The problems they faced were mostly either internal conflict or getting people to notice them. But when \u00b5's put in their best effort and succeeded nearly every time. Sunshine does deal with those very same themes in its own way, but it also deals with heavily a theme that the original series never really touched upon. Rejection. People who heard what they had to say, considered where they were coming from and just said 'no'.\\n\\n\r\nI'm honestly not sure if a theme like that would be a good fit in the original series. But this is a completely new series and Sunrise have taken this as an opportunity to try something completely new. While the show also deals with many of the same themes as the original, it does so in a very different way. The show initially lures you into believing that the impact \u00b5's has had means their journey is gonna be a walk in the park. Right? Right? Wrong! Not only are they outright rejected on a number of occasions, but they have an even harder time getting people to hear them out. School idols are everywhere in this day and age so standing out from the crowd is a lot more difficult. Even their flashy Babymetal-esque rivals Saint Snow have difficulty getting people on their side. Plus unlike \u00b5's, Aqours don't live in the heart of Tokyo and getting people to notice them out in the middle of nowhere is a very difficult task. \\n\\n\r\nTo put it simply, they're being brought down by circumstances completely out of their control. You can understand their frustration over being in this situation because these are all problems that everyone has to face at some point in their life. These themes aren't some super complex analysis of the human condition, but they're a perfect fit for the type of series that Love Live Sunshine is trying to be. Not only are the themes relatable to a lot of people regardless of cirmustance, but they're executed really well... at least for the most part. If I had to make a criticism (And I kinda do since this a review and not just a discussion of why I love the show) it's that it takes a while to get really stuck into the themes. The show is very deliberately paced and every episode is filled with great moments, but it's not until the final few episodes where the show really flourishes. That's not to say what comes before it is a waste of time. But even though I thoroughly enjoyed the series from start to finish its finest moments are definitely during the latter episodes. That being said this is admittedly a very weak criticism. I found the show as a whole to be fantastic and I can't imagine those last few episodes being anywhere near as impactful had it not been for everything that came before it.\\n\\n\r\nA new series brings with it a new set of characters and I was really impressed with what they brought to the table this time around. They've all got their cute little quirks and catchphrases as expected but there's a little bit more to them once you get past all that. In terms of comedy the 9 girls all have a great dynamic and bounce off of each other really well when the show wants to make the viewer laugh. But they've also got a wide range of emotions as well as a number of flaws. It's nothing ultra complicated but there's enough to them so that they feel more human and believable than what some would argue (Looking at you Yamakan) is necessary in this kind of series. \\n\\n\r\nWhen I read the character descriptions I was particularly worried about Yohane since Chuunibyou's are a very stale trope in anime. But the show does a fantastic job of justifying her reasons for being that way and her love of the occult. Ruby is often shy and scared but when the going gets tough she isn't afraid to get assertive. Hanamaru is kind and pleasant to a fault but she's also a goofball and an antisocial bookworm who has trouble making friends. I could go on to describe what makes each and every character great and how they evolve over the course of the series but I'm rambling enough as it is. Though I think what's most important in creating a strong show is a strong lead character and Chika certainly delivers. Chika always wants to do the best she can by her friends but she isn't without her flaws. As much as she tries she's not always capable of making a difference. But over the course of the series she becomes more understanding of her own limitations and more reliant on the people around her. Not only does this make her a likeable character, but a believable one too. And the same goes for the rest of the cast too.\\n\\n\r\nThough there is an elephant in the room that I think is worth discussing. Kanan. All things considered she did get a good amount of attention in the later episodes and the buildup to that point was handled very well. But when you're watching the show weekly you just can't help but wonder 'Where's Kanan?'. Fortunately, the resolution to the conflict between the third years is probably one of the best moments in the entire show. Conflict between characters can make or break a series depending on how it's handled. In Love Live's Sunshine's case, it brings about some of the show's very best moments. The show's world is definitely an exaggerated version of reality but every problem they face arises naturally. They're problems that one can reasonably expect to occur in their situation and they're always solved in an emotionally satisfying way. Simply put, the characters and their interactions are probably Love Live Sunshine's greatest strength.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in Love Live Sunshine is a definite strong point of the series but I wouldn't call it mind blowing. It's a very good looking show that definitely blows the vast majority of anime out of the water. That being said the production quality isn't on the same level as something like Madoka Magica, Fate/Zero or a KyoAni production. Just like the original series the show mixes 2D and 3D animation for its performance scenes and they're an absolute visual treat with a lot of great effects and some very memorable choreography. I've come to accept that the CG animation is an intentional design choice so I'm not going to criticise the show just because they use that style. However it definitely does look a bit wonky on occasions and even at its best it never looks as good as the 2D animation. But overall, when it comes to the visuals the positive far outweigh the positives.\\n\\n\r\nOf course another important aspect in a show like this is the sound. I mean, it is an idol show right? The voice acting, the songs, the sound design, the background music, all of this is very important. The show isn't flawless in every regard but the way the show uses sound is definitely one of its strengths. The songs themselves are plentiful, diverse and very easy on the ears to say the least. The fast paced energy of the opening theme that gets you hyped for the episode, the infectious bouncy melody of Kimeta yo Hand in Hand, the pounding bass drum and soaring vocals in Mijuku Dreamer. Even if you were to detach the songs from the flashy choreography in the performance scenes there's a lot to talk about. Not every song is as awesome as Mijuku Dreamer, but they're all great for their own reasons and not one of them is a dud.\\n\\n\r\nOn the topic of sound, voice acting! While there are quite a few well known seiyuu playing side characters every single one of the 9 girls is played by a newbie. That being said, they've obviously been trained very well. The girls all sound distinctive and their acting is on point nailing both the light hearted comedy scenes and the more dramatic moments of the series. There are a few missed lip flaps and awkward line reads, but in the grand scheme of things these are relatively minor flaws. The seiyuu performances are a key aspect of any show like this and Love Live Sunshine does not disappoint. Just like its predecessor, Sunshine does indeed have an English dub. While NIS America handled the first series in conjunction with Bang Zoom, Love Live Sunshine is entirely a Funimation effort. Moving from Texas to LA means there's a whole new talent pool to work with and the dub uses this to its advantage with a good mix of newbies and veterans from the area. In an effort to remain consistent with the original series the English dub is directed by Caitlin Glass who played Maki in the original series. However, just like the Japanese version, there are no returning cast members. There's definitely some awkward line reads and questionable translation choices here and there but all things considered it's a very solid dub handled by a team of people who evidently enjoy working on the show. However in this case I have to say my preference is with the original Japanese version.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Love Live Sunshine was an unexpectedly great series that follows up on the original in a very big way. Rather than relying on what made the original series great, Sunshine (And Aqours) establishes itself as something uniquely amazing. I could go on forever talking about everything this show does right yet my issues with the show are relatively minor. It's obligatory that I mention the things that bothered me in a review, but honestly I could spend way longer talking about why I loved the show. It's very rare that a show elicits that kind of positive response out of me so obviously they've done something right. Love Live Sunshine is undeniably something special and I would be very surprised if anything else can take its place as my favourite anime of 2016.",

            "content": "The second anime installment to the hit music/idol franchise Love Live!, Sunshine follows the story of second year high school student Takami Chika as she chases her dream.\r\nAll of her life, Chika has always been normal.\r\n\"To have been absorbed in something you love. To have a dream of what you want to become... I never had that.\"\r\nChika thought that she had to be special to be like that.

She realized the wonders of school idols, and decided to do it withher friends. She wanted to have a goal, and she wanted to work hard for it. She wants to shine.\\n\\n\r\nBeing the most anticipated anime for Summer 2016, many are quick to hate on it. You'll often hear claims that it's just a rehash of the first series, that the plot is the same for both. But what makes up a plot, anyways? Is it how things go, the events that happen; or is it the reason, the \"why\", to the things that happen? I'll let you decide for your self.\\n\\n\r\nAs this is the second anime series under the Love Live franchise, you'd expect it to more or less have the same strengths and weaknesses in the overall animation. Like the clean character designs, and the god awful 3DCG when dancing. Surprisingly, though, Sunshine is all strengths. Sunrise (the animators) delivered an overwhelming upgrade to its aesthetics. The art is really detailed and clean. Characters are refined, and the scenery and background are really spectacular. The animation is smooth and fluid, and the 3DCG now fits into the sequencing with better motion and design. Also, the water is really really marvelous. It resembles more the School Idol Movie than it does the original series.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is understandably outstanding. The voice acting fits the characters personalities, and feels natural to listen to. The sound effects are consistent and doesn't overpower the main dialogue, and the ambient sounds pay close attention to detail. There's always the low and soft sound of water moving and waves crashing when they're near a body of water, and there are random seagull squawks every now and then, as expected of a seaside town. It makes you feel like you''re genuinely there. The background music fits with the atmosphere, and carries the many emotions of the show. As for the songs, you can expect it to be great. The opening and ending themes are catchy and tells the story of them as they start out. The songs are good as it is, but gets even better with the emphasis they put on them.\\n\\n\r\nThe concept for the story is pretty straightforward, and that is good for a fun show about girls following their dreams and having fun. This isn't meant to be a deep and complex story. The pacing is perfect. Events happen and change at a decently slow speed, which gives more time for the characters to interact, and for their feelings to show and intentions to take shape. With this, the development of each character is clear. Also, Sunshine goes to great lengths and makes excellent use of its elements in emphasizing their characters struggles and accomplishments, creating these beautiful and touching moments unexpected to the viewer, making it that much more of an enjoyable and memorable show.\\n\\n\r\nI loved the first series, and I went into Sunshine knowing that I would also love it. It could have just been me being biased, or it could have just been them riding the immense wave of popularity left by \u00b5's, so I wondering if they could really do it. But I honestly didn't expect it to be this good. It's been breaking a lot of my expectations, and I have high hopes for this series. I want to see the heights they'll take this golden opportunity to and make a name for themselves. Already, they are shining, but I believe they'll become greater and brighter.",

            "content": "Love Live Sunshine is the second installment of the very popular Love Live franchise. There were people when this anime was announced were unhappy this even existed and couldn't come to grasp that Muse was officially over. The anime has officially wrapped up so the question is, does it live up the expectations set by its predecessor? \r\nMINOR SPOILER WARNING\r\nStory: 8\r\nOne of the bigger complaints when this anime was first announced and what was shown in the first few episodes is the copy/paste of the plot from the original Love Live. Such moments include the student council president forbidding a school idol club, a girlwho's good at the piano but initially refuses to be a part of the idol group, the \"Start Dash\" moment of the first performance, etc. The main ideas of those plot points are in there but are executed differently. For example, Dia's reason for not allowing a school idol club makes sense (although selfish) instead of Eli's reasoning of trying to save the school her way and not something as silly as a school idol club. \\n\r\nIn all honesty, I think the story was one of the better parts as they handled the plot portion better and there didn't feel as if there was forced drama. Now let me explain. In the original Love Live, most of the story was just forming the group, practicing, having some cute moments and preparing for Love Live. Somewhere down the line Sunrise figured they needed to add in a drama part so the last 3-4 episodes involved Kotori's decision on going to Los Angeles for fashion. In Sunshine, the drama involved the past of Kanon, Dia, and Mari and why Kanon/Dia were against school idols which was a sub plot up until episode 9 when the full group is formed. Other characters had their drama moments but this was the \"big\" one of the season which I liked.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I felt that even with the plot points of the original present, the full plot was executed better.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\\n\r\nThe CGI looks lots better here. The 2D art makes the girls look really cute and the CGI makes them look really pretty (the performances are probably one of the high points of this show). The scenery and other characters look really well drawn and a pleasant treat for the eyes. Probably one of the best parts of this show for me.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\\n\r\nNow one of the big things about an anime about music is...having good music. The music here is good but it lacks the \"wow\" factor of the original (granted the original Love Live existed for 3 years prior to the anime so they had a selection of music available) but none of the music in Sunshine compared to listening to Bokura wa Ima no Naka de or No Brand Girls for me. Having said that, Young Dreamer is probably my favorite song from Sunshine. Yume Kataru yori Yume Utaou (the ED sang by various combonations of Aqours) is pretty good too.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe best parts of the Love Live franchise are the music and characters. I feel that, compared to the original, the characters here are worse (I do not like Kanon at all) but they're still enjoyable overall. They kind of fill the cliche's from the original (leader, loyal best friend, girl who thinks she doesn't fit as a school idol, shy girl) but how they act and interact with each other is enjoyable. Just like the original, you will probably find a character you really enjoy and take part in the waifu wars for Sunshine.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8:\\n\\n\r\nThis was the one anime I was looking forward to this season so when the weekend came I was ready to watch Sunshine. I liked the anime and enjoyed watching the ups and downs the characters faced in the show and the adventure they went on to become school idols.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8:\\n\\n\r\nSunshine's story is better executed and the art looks better than the original but the music and characters are less enjoyable than the original. Having said that, the girls of Aqours are a good replacement to Muse and can only expect good things in the future from them. Yosoro!",

            "content": "As a big fan of Love Live I was really expecting Love Live Sunshine this summer.  Most of the Love Live fanbase was trying so much to hate this anime since Aquors was replacing \u00b5's and most of them were trying to hate the new girls.  I always thought Sunshine would make a fresh new start in the series and would make us like the new girls in a different way we loved \u00b5's.  Sadly, Love Live Sunshine didn't live up on my expectations, but still it is a very enjoyable anime.\r\nStory 5/10\r\nEven though I started liking the story, the writing becomesrepetitive.  Most of the ideas were taken out from the first anime: Start:Dash moment, school is closing again, some characters were retired idols.  While I feel like \u00b5's spent too much time practicing and worrying about Love Live, Aquors like to hang out and eat ice cream.  During the final episodes, Chika wants to practice a lot, but still, it seems like the anime focuses more on \"cute girls doing cute things\".\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI'm not disappointed with the character writing, but I don't feel overwhelmed neither.  Most of the characters were already written in Love Live.  Chika is a Honoka clone:   it's the exact same character with no actual reason to become school idol except \"I want to shine\".  We have Ruby, a Hanayo-like character who is cute and loves idols.  Dia is the student council president that doesn't want Chika to become an idol at first, exactly like Eli. Mari is a Nozomi like character who says english stuff combined with japanese, she also rubs everyone's breasts...uhh.  Then we have Riko, who is an Um -like character combined with Maki's abilities, she serves as the protagonist main love interest and best friend (I'm not kidding here).  Kanan is a gloomy character that becomes more like Eli as time passes.  Yoshiko is probably one of my favorite characters, even though her character has been done a lot of times; she delivers fun like Nico in a Chunii way, but Nico is probably funnier, and I don't like Nico a lot.  I feel like Hanamaru and You are the best characters here.  You is a girl with a lot of security but she's kind of jealous, she is always smiling  and cheering people up; she isn't a Kotori, since Kotori is always trying to accept everyone's opinions, even when hers are being rejected.  Hanamaru is a Rin-like character, except she isn't Rin; she always says \"zura\" except of \"nya\", but she has a lot of character development and I can understand her character a lot.    \\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAs always, Love Live delivers colorful art along with beautiful music. The animation is fine, thanks to Sunrise.  All performances look gorgeous and the girls look pretty.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is pretty dramatic and funny, so you will always get a lot of laughs and tears.  There aren't many plot twists, so it loses a lot of Enjoyment, since you know the girls are going to make it eventually.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\\n\r\nWith repetitive characters, mediocre story writing, but beautiful music and sound, Love Live Sunshine!! will be loved by LoveLivers but it lacks the spirit the first anime had.",

            "content": "We all know that Love Live! is an economically successful franchise. I admit, I've also sinked some of my money on Love Live! 'cause I'm a big fan of the franchise. So it's no surprise that this got a spin off. I was really hyped for Sunshine and now that I finished the series, did it live up to my expectations?\r\n(This review will contain SPOILERS)\r\n[Story]\r\nWhen Sunshine got announced, I got really excited because I wanted to see more Love Live!. I was skeptical though because when I saw the 10 minutes character introduction PV for LL Sunshine, not only do some characters of this newgroup look like the original cast from Love Live! (You and Kotori, Mari and Eli, and etc.) but also, some of the characters' personalities are alike. They basically show you the bio of the new characters in the video and that's how I learned about their personalities. \\n\\n\r\nJust like the 1st Season of Love Live!, the story here is relatively simple and fairly similar to the 1st Season of LL. The difference here is Love Live! Sunshine!! takes place about 5 years after  \u00b5's disbanded and now focuses on a new group called \"Aquors\" (pronounced as Aqua) which consists of 9 girls aspiring to become the next famous school idol like  \u00b5's. Just like the previous seasons of Love Live though, I don't really give a shit about the story since the school idols are the main focus of the series and the songs. \\n\\n\r\nThe aspect that I found a bit annoying, but nothing major, in Sunshine is the constant references of \u00b5's and callbacks. Yes, I get it. They won Love Live and they're very famous but I just found it really annoying that the show constantly mentions \u00b5's this and that. For example, the episode that introduced us to Hanamaru. I got really irritated at the end of the episode because of how much they were focusing on Rin's shot. I get it, she's relating herself to Rin but it was too much. Now, there's a reason why I didn't exactly dislike the said aspect that much. \\n\\n\r\nIn the first 7 episodes, Chika was basically following  \u00b5's' footsteps and thinking that if she does exactly what  \u00b5's did, she and her group would become just as popular as  \u00b5's. I'm glad that the 8th episode completely blew my conception of Sunshine being just a \"blatant rip-off of Love Live!\". I really love the 8th episode because it was reality slapping Chika's face. Aquors got 0 points in  the preliminaries and she realizes that ever since  \u00b5's won Love Live, the idol competition has become way more competitive than before and she also realized that simply copying  \u00b5's won't get them to where they want to go. Man, I am loving this \"From nothing to something\" concept that I've been seeing in anime lately. Aquors' song \"Step!Zero to One!\" now makes perfect sense. Btw, that song is really good.  \\n\\n\r\nLove Live Sunshine is also aware of the fact that Aquors is copying \u00b5's and that's the reason why I mostly changed my mind about the constant references and callbacks of \u00b5's in earlier parts of the series. In the 12th episode, Chika realized how \u00b5's exactly got successful and also realized that she needs to stop copying \u00b5's, be their own selves and forge a new path, breaking away from \u00b5's. This whole season is basically about Aquors forming and learning about who they truly are. I'm quite excited for the 2nd Season, now that Aquors is heading on their own path towards success.  \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]: (9.5/10)\\n\r\nThe art style of the original Love Live was decent, at best and the character designs looked good but was too moe, for my taste, but I got used to it. Also, just like everyone else, I hated the use of CGI in \u00b5's Live Shows. However, in Love Live Sunshine, every aspect of the show's visuals and animation is significantly improved. The art style looks better, the visuals and backgrounds is more superior than the predecessor and the character designs looks like more work was put into it. The Live Shows, for once, doesn't burn my eyes. It's looks like Sunrise learned how to utilize and blend the CGI and 2D Animation perfectly. Seriously, watching Aquors' CGI performance was a lot more bearable than watching \u00b5's CGI performance. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________ \\n\r\n[Sound]: (10/10)\\n\r\nAs a \u00b5's fan, I'm sorry for betraying \u00b5's by saying this but Aquors' songs sounds A LOT better than most \u00b5's songs. Aquors songs sounds more energetic and lively as opposed to \u00b5's dramatic-tune and sometimes melancholic but with a touch of happiness (That's the best I can explain \u00b5's songs). In LL 1st Season, the only songs that I liked was START:DASH and Susume Tommorow. In Sunshine, I love almost every song. Some examples are Kimeta yo Hand in Hand, Daisuki Dattara Daijoubu (which completely shits on almost every \u00b5's song that I've listened to in the past few years), Omoi yo hitotsu ni nare, and more because you get what I'm trying say here. I just wished that they used \"Step!Zero to One\" in the last episode because it would have fit the show's context.   \\n\\n\r\nThe OP theme song is \"Aozora Jumping Heart\" by Aquors. I really love this OP the same reason I love the mentioned songs earlier. It's better than the 1st OP of Love Live but it's on par with the 2nd OP of Love Live. \\n\r\nThe ED theme song is \"Yume Kataru yori Yume Utaou \" by Aquors. Just like the first OP, I also love this song but if I have to be more specific, I love the version where only Chika and Riko were singing. I think this is better than the 1st ED of Love Live! but the 2nd ED of Love Live! is still better than Sunshine's ED. \\n\\n\r\nI watched the show in English Dub and Subs but I'm only going to review the Japanese's VA's singing talent. Chika, Riko and You's singing voices are godlike and they're 50% of the reason why Aquors' songs are great. Hell, that's the reason why I think \"Daisuki Dattara Daijoubu\" is better than most \u00b5's songs. Their voices are just absolutely amazing and I'd prefer if Chika, Riko and You have their own subunit. I still don't know why one of Aquors' official subunit comprises of Chika, You and Ruby. It should have been Riko instead of Ruby :/ \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Characters]: (8/10)\\n\r\nDespite all the good things that I've been saying about Aquors, I still like the members of \u00b5's more than the members of Aquors. It's not because Aquors is uninteresting. It's because the characters from Love Live! has way more screentime and character development than Aquors at the moment. Once Sunshine gets 2nd Season and a movie then I'll love Aquors just as much as I love \u00b5's. \\n\\n\r\nLike the original Love Live!, Sunshine has 9 characters and evenly split into 3 girls per grade. I just want to say that the difference between Aquors having 9 members and \u00b5's having 9 members is that \u00b5's 9 members group had meaning into it and makes perfect sense because of the name of their group while Aquors' amount of members is just....umm..yea.....Who cares, right? Gotta stick with the winning formula and I'm not complaining. Anyways, the first years are Ruby Kurosawa, Hanamaru Kunikida and Yoshiko Tsushima (Yohane). Ruby is Dia's younger sister and she's shy and bit of an introvert girl. To make it more simpler, she's like Hanayo except I found Ruby to be a lot more cuter but Hanayo's extreme love for rice was what made her more likable. Hanamaru is Ruby's best friend and she loves to read books and she has little to no knowledge when it comes to technology since she lives at a temple. She says \"zura\" at the end of her sentence all the time. To make it more simpler, she's like Rin except she's a bookworm and she doesn't get on my goddamn nerves. Then there's Yoshiko, a chuunibyou girl who thinks she's the \"fallen angel\" and she prefers to be called by her persona \"Yohane\". Honestly, I still prefer Nico over her but I can't help but love her \"Yohane\" persona. I wouldn't mind sacrificing myself to become her little demon. \\n\\n\r\nThen there's the second years Chika Takami, You Watanabe and Riko Sakurauchi. You (Pronounced as Yo) is Chika's longtime childhood friend and has a habit of dressing up in a sailor suit since she's a marine enthusiast. You is currently my best girl of the series. Judging by her appearance, you'd think she's like Kotori except she's not. Besides her designing Aquors' costumes, hers and Kotori's personality are nothing alike. You is more lively and her voice doesn't make my ears bleed while Kotori is the cute girl but with an ear-piercing voice. As much as I want to make a You pun right now, I don't want to because I love \"you\" and I really don't want to break \"you\" 're heart by making all these terrible puns xD. Chika is the enthusiastic leader of Aquors. I just want to mention that Chika got way more character development than Honoka did in the 1st Season of LL. In the original LL, it wasn't until the 2nd Season where Honoka got a character development. Even so, Chika's character development is already more impressive than Honoka so even though both characters' enthusiasm and determination to reach their goals are the same, I still prefer Chika over Honoka. Riko is a transfer student from Otonokizaka High (\u00b5's school) and a girl who plays the piano. Riko is like a mixture of Umi and Maki and I really like her Maki side. In other words, I like it when Riko gets all flattered over something. \\n\\n\r\nThen there's the third years Dia Kurosawa, Mari Ohara, and Kanan Matsura. Dia (Pronounced as \"Daya\" or as in Diamond) is the student council president. She's mostly like Eli, in terms of her being stubborn at times and the way she acts as a student council president. The similarities are there. The difference here is Dia has a legitimate reason for rejecting Chika's application sheet to form a school idol club. I mean, Eli has a legitimate reason too but both of their reasons are completely different. Mari is a rich girl who decided to come back to Uranohoshi after hearing about someone forming a school idol. I really thought Mari was going to be either Nozomi or Eli but boy, was I wrong. I mean, the only similarities between Mari and Nozomi is they both like to grope someone's breast but other than that, their personalities are completely different. I also love Mari's \"Engrish\" catchphrases. Especially her \"It's joke\" quote and my most favourite is her \"Oh My God!\" quote. Fun fact: Mari's \"It's joke\" quote was kept in the English Dub version but almost every one of her Engrish quotes was changed to an Italian accent. Kanan is that almost non-existent character who barely made an appearance in the first half of the series but had more screentime in the second half. I started liking Kanan more when the third years were getting more focus on the early 2nd half of the series. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]: (8.5/10)\\n\r\nFace it people, \u00b5's time is over and it's Aquors' time to shine. The sooner you accept that, the more you'll enjoy this show like I did. I really enjoyed the characters, especially Chika and her determination to never give up even though she got cornered but managed to got herself out of the position. Plus, the songs are better than most songs from \u00b5's. Currently, my Aquors-created playlist in my phone is now at over 13 songs and counting. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[VERDICT]\\n\r\nWhen Love Live Sunshine and Aquors first got introduced, I was a bit skeptical at first because I thought they wouldn't live up to \u00b5's' greatness. Now that I finished Sunshine, the series blew away my expectations. As of right now, \u00b5's is still better but Aquors has a lot of potential to overtake \u00b5's and as time grows on, they'll either be on par with them or end up being better than them. I mean, most of Aquors' songs are already better than what the 1st Season of LL offered. \\n\r\nThe story is recycled but I kind-of saw this coming since the 2nd Season of LL did the same shit. Also, the \u00b5's references and callbacks were a bit dragged out. The character is where it's at though. The character development for the third years and the 2nd year, especially Chika were really good but just like the 2nd Season of LL, their character development will definitely get better (and hopefully more character development for the first years) once Sunshine gets 2nd Season. \\n\\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL]: (8.5/10)\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+Aquors turned out to be a very lovable idol group at the end of the series\\n\r\n+Aquors' songs are great and better than \u00b5's songs from 1st and 2nd Season \\n\r\n+Enjoyable characters with amazing character dynamics between two or three Aquors members\\n\r\n+Great character development for Chika and the 3rd years\\n\r\n+Visually Appealing Animation\\n\r\n+CGI in Live Shows is significantly improved\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Constant references and callback to \u00b5's got a bit annoying",

            "content": "What does it mean to shine?\r\nIn lieu of the mainstream media and audiences embracing 'dark and mature' storytelling in favor of 'childish junk' catered towards 12 year olds, this question shouldn't even be relevant in today's world. Yet here it is, in all of its glory. And for the past six years, only one franchise dared to ever raise that question in the 2010s.\r\nLove Live has enjoyed worldwide popularity, and not just because it has cute girls and really nice songs. If such were the case, then that would mean stuff like Show by Rock! would be popular. Sunrise doesn't just take what it seesand rolls with it, adding irrelevant junk and catering to '\"realistic\", cute-girls-need-to-suffer fags' and 'wish-fulfillment' like IM@S does, but instead, takes the whole package; by creating story about girls striving to shine, and really, that's all it needs to be. \"So, how different, then, is it from other idol shit like Aikatsu?\" I'll tell you why.\\n\\n\r\nBecause Love Live succeeds at it. Especially Sunshine.\\n\\n\r\nI'll be the first to admit that I was downright skeptical when this was first announced. I was worried it was going to be a copy of the first season, making the same formulaic recruitment episodes and drama, and the mistakes that plagued it. And oh boy was I wrong. I mentioned earlier that Sunrise takes the 'whole package', so what exactly is in it? It's everything about idols. From the way they dress, what they sing down to the girl's personalities and the struggles of adolescence. However, they didn't always succeed at using it. Let's date back to the first Love Live season. While superb in its own way, there were things that prevented perfect enjoyment, such as issues with characterization and drama, as well as circumstances that made little to no sense on the part of some character arcs. All of these problems were whisked away with the advent of Love Live S2, which is probably the most inspiring piece of media I have ever watched. No teen melodrama or action-induced fantasy isekai story is able to say \"go do something better with your life\" better than this particular second season has, filled to the brim with sad and happy moments that touch my heart deeply. And after just one year after Muse ended their story, Sunshine arrived. \\n\r\nSeeing as it'd be another first season, you could understand my fear. But Sunshine does more than just correct the mistakes of the first season. It takes the very concept of creating a school idol group and makes it its own. Sure, the entire ordeal is formulaic on paper, but the way it blossoms is just so spectacular and uplifting, its as though its not Love Live at all. Yet at the same time, it is.\\n\\n\r\nAt first glance, the character designs look about the same, with some copied tropes from the previous series (e.g. student council president, the clumsy one, the shy one, the \"futsu no onna\" one, the groper etc.). I'm not gonna surprise you by saying \"OH! BUT THEYRE DIFFERENT!\", no. Essentially, they are different takes on the trope, and this is necessary if Sunshine really wants to tell a new kind of story. What makes these characters stand out and shine on their own is the way they are characterized, and this has a lot to do with the involvement of Muse. It's actually amazing how much influence a group of characters that aren't even there have on the story. In Sunshine, Muse have moved on from singing school girls to living, breathing gods. From the way they're only seen through posters to the way the characters talk about them with revere and divinity. Heck, in one of the episodes, one of the girls sends a fan letter to Honoka (from the first 2 seasons) but it sounds more like a fucking prayer than fan mail. \\n\r\nEssentially, Idol anime are character stories, taking the viewer through the journey of a girl to become the number one star. And while some anime require about a hundred episodes to make a story whole, some only need as few as 13. \\n\r\nSunshine is rich with flavorful characterization, often using visual directing to do most of the talking rather than outright telling. The use of common/cheesy phrases and emphasis of tone help bring out what these girls are, pulling away from the idea that every teenage girl is a dark, wild and emo Chloe Moretz and instead giving the audience something very different. They give them dreams; desires, none poisonous, but awfully human and representative of who the girls are inside and out. From painful outbursts to soft-spoken sympathy, Sunshine embraces the use of imagery and dialogue to tell us who these characters really are without (mostly) words. A girl seeking acceptance taking a stray hand, a girl who hasn't once dreamed of breaking out of her shell witnessing it on a magazine cover, the desire to shine brighter than diamonds with everyone you've met; there are simply so many things to take from these characters, and in only 13 episodes. Sure, it can be lacking at times, but what the series delivered was more than enough. I'm not going to say what exactly was developed and how; that's for you to experience yourself.\\n\r\nSide-characters were also great, but a bit underused. Of course, with idols, you're always going to have competition and just from simply existing, Saint Snow captures that feeling of intimidation almost perfectly. From their music, to the way they walk, they were certainly very captivating, not only in terms of fear for the main cast, but in their outright beauty. The rest of the cast were your supportive sisters and classmates, and were utilized well if to help the series lose that feeling of insularity.\\n\\n\r\nGoing technical, Sunshine not only looks better, is animated better or sounds better. It also FEELS better. It's taken the spirit of Love Live and turned it into something so engrossing and captivating to watch. The short moments on stage are always spectacular, showcasing lots of fluid choreography and outstanding cinematography that puts the original series' efforts to dirt. . While newcomers will be engulfed by the simply beautiful direction of these sequences, old time fans will be welcomed again by the feelings and passionate emotion present in the film or even, dare I say, the Final Live. The music is also fantastic. Every track resembled what was happening at the moment of the series and creates a wholly immersive experience when listening to the tune and lyrics. The best example I can give is Saint Snow's performance, \u300cSelf Control\u300d. It was certainly the most memorable moment in the series, not only in introducing Saint Snow as an idol group or a threat, but as professionals; a pair that knew exactly what they were doing and knew how to do it good. \\n\r\nThe backdrop work and animating are nothing short of ecstatic. There is more fluidity in the character and mouth movements, use of lighting and colors are beautifully done and the sound quality is great. There is simply no reason not to watch this in 1080p, if only to get the full experience of the series. On part of directing outside of character drama, there is a whole slew of hilarious moments. Some great, some just okay but nothing ever a bad joke. The timing of the jokes and delivery are a lot better than in previous seasons, where it was usually out of nowhere or just downright unfunny at times. Slice of Life moments had great presentation, making use of attractive sea-like colors for reflection and energy of the scene, to drive out the boredom. \\n\r\nThis is money very well spent on Sunrise's part. \\n\\n\r\nLove Live! Sunshine!! recaptures the beauty of the original series through different lens and delivers something that exceeded all of my expectations. It is the second series this year that's made me feel so emotionally captivated, enough to make me shed tears. 2016 wasn't so great but with gems like these, any year can be truly memorable. I look forward to whatever Sunrise has in store for the franchise next, or if we're ever getting that Yohane spin-off that's in high demand right now.\\n\\n\r\n8/10\\n",

            "content": "This review includes spoilers up to episode 6, as well as various parts of the original Love Live series.\r\nAfter watching and thoroughly enjoying both seasons and the movie of the original Love Live series, I was excited to start Sunshine and experience a new setting, characters, and story. Unfortunately, after 6 episodes, it has become very clear that there is nothing new to be experienced here.\r\nFirst of all, the characters. They have different names and faces, but make no mistake - they are clones of the girls from the first series. Chika is Honoka, You is Kotori, Riko is Umi, Ruby is Hanayo, Hanamaru isRin, Yoshiko is Nico, Dia is Eli, and Mari is Eli. The only one I can't comment on would be whether Kanan is a Maki clone. She hasn't been shown in much detail up to this point, so it's hard to say. I would be very surprised if she ended up NOT being a clone, though. I could go into detail about how each of these characters end up being a clone of another, but I think if you watch even one episode it will become very clear that this is the case.\\n\\n\r\nNext, the plot. Guess what, it's just copied and pasted from the original series yet again, only done worse. The series starts out with no actual motivation for the girls to become school idols - they just want to. That's weak and uninteresting, but in episode 6 it's revealed that the school is set to be closed due to lack of interest from students. Hey, at least they addressed the lack of motivation for the girls, but they did so by literally reusing the same plot as before!\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that really rubbed me the wrong way in the plot was the girls' first concert. If you remember \u03bc's first concert, the curtain opened to reveal that no one showed up. It was a powerful scene that served the purpose of telling the girls that their goal wouldn't be easy to achieve, and they wouldn't be instantly successful. In fact, this scene is probably my favorite scene in the entire Love Live anime. Sunshine attempts to copy this scene, but it messes it up to an incredible extent. Instead of leaving it at no one showing up and using that to show the girls that it will be hard, it turns out everyone is just late to the concert! It sets a precedent that the girls cannot and will never fail, unlike \u03bc's who actually DID fail on multiple occasions and grew from it. If you're going to copy a scene, at least do it right instead of completely undermining the entire purpose of the scene.\\n\\n\r\nI know some people might be upset because I only watched 6 episodes, but it became very clear to me in those 6 episodes that I was in store for nothing more than a clone of the original series with much worse execution.",

            "content": "First of all, Love Live! Sunshine!! is a show that needs you to pay attention and to understand it, which is kind of interesting considering most of these types of shows are pretty straightforward, but this one needs you to understand the message it starts building up at the very beginning and that it concludes really well. Hopefully this will erase all the misconceptions about this show that you might have seen anywhere else on the internet. I'll have a TL;DR section at the end if any of you wishes to skip the explicit content.\r\nAlso, it is not completely necessary to watch the predecessor series,Love Live! School Idol Project, to watch Sunshine since they follow two different groups, but as a recommendation, you should check it out if you still haven't. It presents references that enhance the experience if you have seen the first series. :)\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nContrary to what some believe, Sunshine!! does not follow the journey of Aqours after its creation, the entirety of this season shows us the background of the group, the reason why it is created, their motivations, the relationships the members develop, why they are different from Muse, etc. This is a much more character driven plot than the one in School Idol Project S1, which was a bit more story driven.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIt follows Chika Takami, a normal high school girl who finds a dream to follow, and that is to shine as a School Idol being influenced by Muse, our protagonist group from Love Live! School Idol Project. Chika creates her School Idol group in Uranohoshi Girls High School, with the goal of being just like Muse and recreating their story, however... will that really wield any good results...?\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe story in Love Live! Sunshine!! is simple and yet needs you to understand it. I'm so tired of the \"Aqours is just a carbon copy of Muse\" thing that makes this show really underrated and that it's been driving me nuts, so let's just get that out of the way first. \\n\\n\r\nSunshine!!  CONSCIOUSLY draws parallels between School Idol Project and Sunshine!! , yes, consciously. They adress this openly and honestly in the anime, Sunshine is intended to reflect and to mirror School Idol Project's setting, just to then get past this comparisons and show us how different the situation is. This is where everything starts to build up, and is at the very beginning of the show, and why? Because the whole message of the show is that \"Aqours is not Muse, and they'll never be\", and \"Be Yourself\". Which is explained and shown later in episodes 8 and 12.\\n\\n\\n\r\n\"Why did they take so long to acknowledge something like that\" you ask? Because the purpose of this show never was to show us Aqours journey right after it is created with all 9 members, but rather to have a season where the torch of the Love Live franchise would be passed from the first generation to the second (done symbolically in episode 12 with Chika catching the feather) and to form the bonds of the members of Aqours. The last shot in episode 13 tells us that the TRUE story of Aqours is beginning now (in the really probable second season and onwards), since the shot replicates the picture that marked the beginning of Love Live! Sunshine!! and Aqours as a multimedia project back in 2015. So, this is the message that the show conveys to us, that they are different, the reasons why they are different, that is important to be yourself and that you can still be influenced by someone but you can walk your own path. \\n\\n\r\nThis is a huge misconception in the franchise so I wanted to get it out of the way first, that Aqours and Sunshine are just blatant carbon copies of its predecessors, trust me, they are not. The show consciously draws this parallels and breaks all the expectations they created in the first half of the show by showing us that they are indeed really different (I'll talk about the characters in the later part). That is the reason why I say this show needs you to pay attention and understand it. This plot point can be seen building up since episode 1, and then reaching its breaking point at a certain episode, which is a complete turning point to the series.\\n\\n\r\nThis first season servers as a set-up season to kick off with Aqours' Love Live story in the future.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nART: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThere's not much to talk about here, an obvious improvement in terms of animation and art compared to the previous TV Anime seasons and that holds a resemblance with the art used on the movie which is just as good. Granted better budget, more to spend on animation and art, but the experience of the animation team clearly shows here too. Art is subjective indeed, so you can like it or dislike it depending on your standards, but it is clean and crisp.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nKind of the same as the art, another improvement which is to be expected since the team has now experience and a bigger budget. The OST has some quite nice tracks that can convey emotions really well.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing to note is how the series captures the sounds of a small and silent seaside town. The squawk of the seagulls, the sound of the waves hitting the shore, it really helps to the immersion and it sounds clean.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of Music and insert songs, is subjective. I like my idol music, so I enjoyed all of the songs, not only here, but on the franchise as a whole. However, Aqours has a distinguishing feature, and is that their singing voices blend together really well and they harmonize a lot. \\n\\n\r\nCoupled with the music and insert songs is the fact that the musical performances are usually linked to character development and plot progression, which is a constant of Love Live that we've seen in previous seasons. So, if you haven't seen it or you thought of them being out of place, I'd recommend you to watch them with subs or look for the lyrics of those songs, since they usually work as an extension or conclusion to a certain topic.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThis. This section is probably the most important besides \"Story\".\\n\\n\r\nLove Live! Sunshine!! is the successor to Love Live! School Idol Project, and Aqours is the successor to Muse, they are part of the same franchise and as such, Dengeki G's Magazine, Sunrise and Lantis need brand continuity to ensure continued profitability and success. This and the fact that they still have the same artist lets us know why are some of the girls similar in design. Is the same as other brands, for example, how the leader of a Power Ranger's team is always a really strong guy, and he becomes the red ranger, this applies the same way here. Similar character archetype and design, yet definitely different characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe girls are intended to be mirrors and reflections of the girls in Muse so people can remember that even though it is a new season, with a new group, it is still Love Live, it is the same franchise, thus, if you come into it looking for similarities in their characters' personalities and design, you will find them on the surface.\\n\\n\r\nHOWEVER, that's all you get, since the show draws parallels between the current cast and the past cast, again, to move past them and then break those expectations and start developing them even further, to the point where they are completely different characters, yet working as a reflection of their predecessors, which is really hard to achieve.  And all of them actually have reasons to act how they do which are shown in each girl's character development episodes. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter development, although there is just a little bit because, again, this is a set-up season, is clean and easy to relate, the drama is well handled and is not forced since all of it has a proper build up, and the character interactions feel natural (except for two characters). Something that helps to this is how the relationships are formed within this group. We have childhood friends in almost every year group, and even between them. We have a pair of sisters as well, etc. All of them, except for Riko, are connected to at least one of the members even before the creation of their group, and it makes sense since they live in a small seaside town, you know that unlike in the big cities, is more likely that most of the population of a small town gets to know each other.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThis kind of story was really enjoyable to me, giving such a nice message of \"Be Yourself\", with a cast of funny eccentric characters while still making them relatable due to the realistic and harsh situations they are put in that will most likely make us cheer for them or feel sympathy towards them if we had experienced it before. If Sunshine was your first entry into the Love Live franchise, I'd kinda bet that you may have enjoyed it as well.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nLove Live! Sunshine!! is a very underated show because it comes after the juggernaut that Muse was (and still is of course), and the huge popularity that they and School Idol Project attained, thus making quite a number of people not wanting to understand it and care for it.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, that is no reason to just blindly hate on it and give it an unfair, superficial judgement. Its story is sweet and simple, yet it has a really deep meaning to it. Its characters are very lovely, enjoyable and relatable, once you get to know them well on the inside, you can see all the development they go through. The music is on point, the drama is very well handled, and my only complaint with the series would be that they wasted a big chunk of the last episode and how it kept forcing Chika and Riko in our faces, overshadowing and throwing aside the rest of the cast, but it still had some nice touching scenes and musical performances.\\n\\n\r\nLooking and analyzing at how it was handled and executed, Sunshine surpasses School Idol Project S1 in almost every aspect, and that's not a bad thing, fellow fans, that's how it should be. With the extra experience and capital the production team has, they are now able to provide better storytelling, better art and animation, better production values on the whole. If they hadn't grow and learn from their mistakes in the past and improved this second time around, it would have been a big failure for the franchise.\\n\\n\r\nThis doesn't mean that you must enjoy one more than the other because it is better made in terms of production, enjoy whatever you want, both series are similar yet different with its own charm, and both are really, really enjoyable. But you should at least acknowledge the effort put into this series to take the anime adaptations of the franchise to a higher level. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: Don't trust all the negative bias and superficial judgement this series has. It shows a story of self-discovery and self-appreciation with characters that are enjoyable, lovely and very different from their predecessors when you get to know them. It is by no means a carbon copy as some call it out to be, and the series shows this with facts throughout its run, addressing this openly and honestly, drawing parallels to its predecessor to then break them all and develop their cast and plot even further, and get past those comparisons as the series advances.\\n",

            "content": "> May contain slight spoilers\r\n> I'm still fairly new to this so pls be gentle.\r\nAh Love Live!, it's good to be back. I missed the friendly bond among the characters, the simple yet endearing story, the colorful and likable cast, and the unforgettable music. Like the original Love Live, Love Live Sunshine has all that. This anime is nostalgia to me, especially the fact that they looked up to Muse, cementing them as legends not only in the Love Live universe but also in my heart. \r\nStory (6/10) :  \r\nAdmittedly, Love Live Sunshine (LLS) is very similar to Love Live School Idol Project (LLSIP)in a lot of ways. The characters are based off of Muse; the story regarding the school as well, the traits and personalities, and a little bit of the looks too. I understand why people may dislike it, why they may want something new. Some would say that if it had an original story it would've been better. I agree to a certain extent but I believe that what we have in Sunshine is just fine. \\n\\n\r\nI also believe Sunshine made use of that foundation better than School Idol Project did-for the most part, at least. I do not dislike the fact that the overall story is similar to SIP. Simply because it is nostalgia to me, and the fact that these girls also looked up to Muse is all the more reason to compliment what is being done in terms of pattern story (if that makes sense). Now it may not seem fair to do that since it is very similar to SIP's original story, but it was clear that they were also going in this direction and I think they did it better.\\n\\n\r\nThe one thing that confuses me though is the ending. Did Aqours win Love Live? I don't really know lol. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation (9/10) :\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is quite spectacular. It is bright, lively and colorful. The background designs are beautiful and it really feels like you're living near the sea. I felt some Nagi no Asukara vibes too. The character designs are pretty and adorable, but nothing new. These girls were inspired by LL SIP so they look alike to a certain degree. The \"antagonist\" of the show (Saint Snow) look interesting. The dark eye colors give off the \"antagonist\" vibe, unlike A-RISE (SIP). The CGI is also significantly better. To sum it up, if there is one word to describe the animation here, it would be \"Sunshine\".\\n\\n\\n\r\nMusic (9/10) :\\n\\n\r\nThe songs are good, but not better than SIP's. Not all of the songs resonated in me. Don't get me wrong, I still loved all of them but nothing really impacted me. The only ones that I really enjoyed are Aozora Jumping Heart, Yume de Yozora o Terashita and Mijuku Dreamer. My favorite Love Live song to date is still START: DASH!! It was fun to hear Yume no Tobira as well. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the voice acting, obviously very well done. The thing with Aqours though is that their individual voices are hard to differentiate. Yes, you can probably tell who is singing a certain part of a song individually (during a solo part), and yes they sound more \"one\" (more harmonious even) when they sing as a group, more so than Muse, but it is hard to tell which voice is which during the those group moments. Muse had powerful and distinguishable voices in both solo and group song parts. This is why I belive that Muse is better than Aqours.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8/10):\\n\\n\r\nAs for Aquors, they were all lovable. It was very easy to like them all in just a few eps. While some characters only got little screen-time (Kanan) or had lesser time as the show progressed (Ruby, You), I still feel like this isn't the show's fault necessartily because its only 13 eps. The most impressive thing for me is that they were able to give them some story in just 1 season. SIP didn't manage to do that as Nozomi and Eli had little time in S1 (compared to the others), Kotori's departure scene was forced, and Umi had not much of a story for herself at all. When you compare it to Sunshine, then Sunshine 'shines' more: Riko's intro and story was well-executed, the 'story-book recruitment' story of Ruby and Hanamura-zura was entertaining, the occultic episode with 'Yohane', the struggles of You, the struggles of Chika and most especially the senpai-arc of Mari, Dia and Kanan-which I believe is the best story arc in any of Love Live. It just had a better story imo. Saint Snow is the weak character link that I don't like though. They didn't feel like a rival, unlike with A-RISE. Maybe its just me. One last small thing, we actually know some other characters here outside of Aqours that provide support to the main cast (relatives, classmates,etc). We didn't get much of that in SIP.\\n\\n\r\nHere's my list of most fave to least fave: Riko, Dia, Mari, Hanamaru, Yoshiko, Ruby, Chika, Kanan, You. This was actually kinda hard because I don't have a clear-cut fave unlike with Maki in SIP. Either way, I didn't really dislike any of them and as usual only the MC got kinda annnoying.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10):\\n\\n\r\nI had a blast. Like I said earlier, this anime was pure nostalgia. It brought back the happy moments and feels that I had with Love Live SIP. It's everything that I wanted and more.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8.4/10):\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation and story- Sunshine was better. Everything else, SIP is. I guess it's not fair because its not an original story but I still feel like it was done better. As of this moment, I feel like Love Live Sunshine is better than Love Live School Idol Project SEASON 1. BUT! I still believe that Muse > Aquors by a mile. That's it for Sunshine! Would definitely listen to their music and watch more should there be an S2 and a movie! Keep shining, Aqours!\\n\\n\r\nTo those who read this review, thank you very much.\\n\r\nThis is my second one, and I hope it was at least remotely helpful.\\n\r\nIf you have yet to see this anime, then I highly recommend it. Although it would be better if you watched Love Live! School Idol Project! first. There won't be a problem if you want to watch this first though, and that may even make for a unique viewing experience.\\n\\n\r\nIf you have finished this anime and maybe trying to find an anime similar to this I recommend K-on! and Idolmaster. I haven't really watched any idol shows outside of the Love Live franchise but these two have been heavily requested to me.\\n\\n\r\nHave a good day! :D",

            "content": "Love Live Sunshine! has ALOT to live up to from the original Love Live, can these new characters be the \"new shiny *cough*\" characters to fill our Love Live cravings...well let's get right into it by talking first about...\r\nThe characters, at best, well LA will pullout LA's notes for this one. BULLETPOINTS TIME!..ohh and some SPOILERS here and there you have been warned\r\n*Chika Takami (voiced by Anju Inami), appearance-wise looks like Rin Hoshizora, has Honoka Kousaka's genkiness and is the character to start it all which also has shades of Honoka.\r\n*You Watanabe (voiced by Shuka Saitou), appearance-wise looks like a short-bobbed Kotori Minami and isalso friends with the main character and wants to get the idol activities started. You parallels Kotori even further as she along with Ruby are costume designers in Aqours as Kotori did in the original. Come her character development episode, she became LA's second favourite character.\\n\r\n*Riko Sakurauchi (voiced by Rikako Aida), appearance-wise is a more longer haired Maki Nishikino and on speaking of Maki, Riko is ALSO a piano player, though Riko's position to Chika is more for Umi Sonoda who does the lyrics for every song, as such Riko is one of the lyricist for Aqours.\\n\r\n*Kanan Matsuura (voiced by Nanaka Suwa), appearance-wise looks like a ponytailed Nozomi Tojo and with that Kanan pretty much embodies Nozomi for the most part (though groping is omitted), her athleticism is also from Rin.\\n\r\n*Dia Kurosawa (voiced by Arisa Komiya) appearance-wise looks a bit like Umi Sonoda, however her personality is completely different with an amalgamation of Eli Ayase (for being the student council president) as well as Nico Yazawa's prideful attitude and Hanayo Koizumi's obsession with idols (though Dia is closeted, her idol obsession, not her prideful attitude). Dia parallels Eli in terms of personality and role as the biggest resistance in forming Aqours, her parallel personality to Eli is even lampshaded at one point.\\n\r\n*Ruby Kurosawa (voiced by Ai Furihata), appearance-wise she's a red-headed vers. of Nico Yazawa but has Hanayo Koizumi's shyness, though her work for needlework pretty much makes her the costume designer for Aqours thus has shades of Kotori Minami, but her personality parallels Hanayo ALOT and is even lampshaded in the series.\\n\r\n*Mari Ohara (voiced by Aina Suzuki) appearance-wise looks like a short-bobbed Eli Ayase (or to be precise a near exact Arisa Ayase, Eli's younger sister with a braid) and Mari even has the mixed descent (Eli being of Russian and Japanese, while Mari of Italian and  Japanese), let's also add in the shades for Eli Ayase as she's has a higher position than Dia (thus giving Mari and Eli the highest position in the student body), lastly she has Nozomi's groping tendencies as well as her personality, she's also the composer of Aqours thus she has shades of Maki.\\n\r\n*Yoshiko Tsushima (voiced by Aika Kobayashi), appearance-wise looks like Umi Sonoda, however her personality is VERY much like Nico Yazawa, though the only things unique about her is her chunni-personality and her extremely bad luck...Yoshiko is actually LA's favourite character from Aqours as besides Yoshiko \"YOHANE\"'s similarity toNico, she is probably the most unique character in Aqours' roster.\\n\r\n*Hanamaru Kunikida (voiced by Kanako Takatsuki)  appearance-wise looks like a longer-haired Hanayo Koizumi, however she has shades of Nozomi Tojo as her family runs a temple like Nozomi. Hanamaru is also the main lyricist of Aqours similar to Umi however Hanamaru's most defining trait of her shyness and self-confidence issues parallels Rin Hoshizora's character development (it's even lampshaded), Hanamaru's parallel to Rin goes deeper as her friendship with Ruby (the Hanayo counterpart), the two even joined Aqours similar to Rin and Hanayo. Finally Hanamaru has a verbal tic similar to Rin (just that Hanamaru uses a variety of Shizuoka verbal tics, while Rin just uses \"~nyan!\".)\\n\\n\r\nWhat LA is trying to say is, this new cast of characters feels like the original Love Live cast members personalities and subtle appearances split and mixed into each other and put into this new cast of Aqours and that really isn't a bad thing, it's liven things up actually. By that even if the character's have shades of the original cast, well guess what, their character and group dynamic were very solid very much like the original cast, the group dynamic helped with especially Chika, You and Riko have some of the best group dynamic together, from their banter to their actions together (aand the obvious yuri undertones throughout the Aquors cast). Outside from Aquors as a group, the individual characters themselves and their developments they personally grow from their own obstacles or griefs, thus as a group they are pretty solid, as individual characters they are of the same caliber as they're group.  \\n\\n\r\nSorry for constantly comparing Sunshine to the original but LA will point out that where the original formed the idol group to save the school, Sunshine on the other hand, Aqours is formed for their own personal growth. If there was something new that Sunshine!! took was the characters motivations, from a Love Live franchise point of view, it's refreshing. As for an idol genre point view, -sigh- iDOLM@STER already did it...\\n\\n\r\nSome of the flaws in this spinoff is that the it has the near same plot beats to the original (from their formation to their idol group to LA's comprehensive character look to their obstacles into forming Aqours), but Love Live Sunshine!! still has it's own flair to make it worthy to it's original even if it uses the same plot beats and somewhat rushed character developments to some of Aqours to the original. The biggest problem with Sunshine is that it places the original season up on a pedestal, thus \"worship and imitates it\", thus it can never surpass or be it's own thing, this is in-universe portrayed through Dia and her resistance to Aqours, thankfully Sunshine became it's own to it's ties to the original season with the homages being nothing but \"Love Live fanservice\" as it did start to focus more on in-characters failures and how they overcome that failure to see it as nothing but a stepping stone to success as well as using previous storyline plot points from the original but even making that their own, really Love Live Sunshine!! just needed a while before it could do it's own thing and stopped fawning over the original cast and thus Sunshine's ties and fangirling to the original cast do sever and becomes it's own and in a more meta-textual way is VERY different from the original series.\\n\\n\r\nQuite simply, it's HOW Sunshine focuses on a certain element in comparison to the original series, the original series was focused more on the \"group\" and \"their goals to save their school\", Sunshine's cast does differently by focusing on it's character's personal problems before facing their failures and the Love Live tournament and yes it's hypocritical that LA noted in LA's character section that Sunshine's cast have personalities and appearances melded together from the original cast, but it's because of the characters having their own struggles instead of the original's \"group goals\". \\n\\n\r\nLA still enjoyed Sunshine even with these flaws as Aqours' in both individual and group dynamic still helped bring in it's bubbly vibe that the Love Live series is known for.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation done by Sunrise as the original series did, well LA has nothing but praise LA can say about the animation, yes even from the integrated CGI dance scenes as it's even more smoothly animated with the traditional animation. The character designs are vibrant and poppy very typical of this franchise and it's even better as there a several background material the characters do while other characters are talking at times, on speaking of which, the backgrounding of the ocean in contrast to the originals cityscape, well that makes Sunshine have a better edge with this kind of scenery scenario. The animation overall was very well done across the board.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of voice acting, we have your typical bubbly moe vocals throughout but it becomes quite obvious who LA's voice actors were, Aika Kobayashi who voiced the eccentric chunni Yoshiko as LA clearly saw that Aika was having soo much fun voicing her and \"getting into character and keeping it up\", she was a barrel of genkiness and aloofness, the other was Shuka Saitou who voiced the ace You, her \"catchphrase and posing\" was memorable and Shuka like Aika embraced her role as You. It's not like these two voice actors were the ONLY best voice actors in this series, the rest of the cast were brilliant and needs praise, sure moe vocals but still.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending was overall satisfying by all means and rounded up the anime quite nicely. By the end of this ending, Sunshine became it's own. Though the \"cliff notes of the entire anime\" as the characters performances were slightly tacky but heartwarming at the same time. The ending was a nice send off to Sunshine and LA actually hopes for a second season as Sunshine has potential to do something entirely different from the original series.\\n\\n\r\nLove Live Sunshine!! had a rather similar start to the original series' plot beats and the obvious similarities to the original characters, but with this rocky start, Sunshine finally opened up into being it's own and quite frankly be different from it's original counterpart, is Sunshine better  or worse than the original series?...well it's up to how you see the Sunshine, LA on the other hand, LA was annoyed by the over-exaggerated homages to the original but still liking Sunshine paying homage to it's original predecessors, but by the halfway mark is when Sunshine really turned into something different instead of being overshadowing and fangirling to it's original and LA is truly thankful for making these new characters though similar in appearance and personality to the original cast, be different both in terms of characters AND plot. Sunshine for LA because of this...isn't better than the original, but can rival it by being different AND still paying homage to it's original.",

            "content": "While Sunshine is a separate anime from first Love Live, there is no way to avoid comparing them. I'd also strongly advise against watching Sunshine if you haven't seen first LL yet.\r\nChronologically, action of this story takes place some time after original one and there are many (too many) mentions of \u00b5\u2019s. It\u2019s clearly aimed at people who already know franchise. This makes main and the most noticeable flaw in this anime even worse: for some reason someone thought it will be a good idea for whole story to follow same plot points as first Love Live. Maybe it was supposed to be some kindof service towards fans, but turned into lazy copy-pasta. One could say that authors simply took skeleton of story and covered it with different girls. To make it funnier, LL story isn\u2019t some masterpiece worth copying. It\u2019s cheesy and predictable - fitting for this show, but also easy to replace with another thing of similar level. Now, if someone actually started with Sunshine, they wouldn\u2019t be bothered by this part, but it\u2019s pretty much a sequel, so that wouldn\u2019t work either.\\n\r\nGenerally speaking, LL Sunshine is much stronger in SoL/CGDCT department than original. As much as I liked \u00b5\u2019s girls, Aqours feel more polished and fitting for anime. Girl\u2019s quirks don\u2019t feel forced or annoying, cast is balanced and, at least for me, there are no obvious best and worst girls.We also get a lot more (and funnier) comedy, great reaction faces and meme worthy moments.\\n\r\nSadly, nothing is perfect. What Sunshine gained in comedy and cuteness, it lost in drama and idol focus. While the problems that girls have to overcome aren\u2019t what I\u2019d call \u201cforced drama\u201d, they aren\u2019t that good or deep either. Another thing this anime didn\u2019t deliver is this feeling of overcoming odds and doing the impossible. Yes, they keep talking about making miracles and stuff, but it just doesn\u2019t have the bang original had, it lacks the inspiring feeling I got when watching \u00b5\u2019s.\\n\r\nWhen talking about Love Live, obvious topic to discuss is music. Let me say that, despite playing School Idol Festival mobage, I\u2019m not really a fan of \u00b5\u2019s music. From Aqours songs I\u2019ve heard so far, personally, I like them more. On the other hand, they are all just nice, while first LL had few of those \u201cspecial\u201d songs that were way above others. Obviously it's matter of preferences, but for me it feels like Aqours' music, despite generally sounding better, lack some kick.\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr: if you are here for idols, you might be disappointed compared to first LL anime. But if you also like cute girls SoLs, then you probably will like it.\\n",

            "content": "For context, I wanted to love this show. Genuinely, Love Live! School Idol Project! is my favourite anime. It is so far the only anime which has made me cry... multiple times. I was hoping for the same sort of experience with Sunshine, and I kid you not, actually abandoned the show halfway trough the first episode. I was already losing faith in the show at this point, but Mari\u2019s first line was in such broken Japanese that I couldn\u2019t bear it. It took me a few weeks to decide to give Sunshine another watch, only to again drop the show due to Mari, specificallythe infamous \u201cIt\u2019s joke\u201d scene. She defies explainantion! Her English is horrible and her Japanese isn\u2019t that much better, bringing in the question as to how she communicates with other people. I finally rejoined the show again and made it through episode 12 when I realised I would never like the show and abandoned it.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s taken me quite a while, but I realised why I instantly connected with Honoka in School Idol Project. After a pretty catchy prelude, episode 1 of School Idol Project literally begins with \u2018Hi, I\u2019m Honoka, oh no my school is going to be shut down, I have to do something!!!\u2019 Her goal wasn\u2019t fame or notability, it was to save the school that was so deeply engrained in her family. Not to mention that Honoka fails. She works her butt off to make Muse\u2019s first little concert happen and nobody showed up to it except for core characters, which acted as the catalyst for their inevitable union.\\n\r\nContrast this with Sunshine\u2019s opening. Chika is immediately met with the world of school idols and is entranced by it. She wants the fame, but doesn\u2019t understand what actually drove Muse. Aqours\u2019 first concert was also a raging success, which kind of took away from Dia\u2019s words. When Eli criticised Honoka in SIP, it\u2019s powerful because despite the horrible failure she just endured, Honoka proves she is not willing to give up. Dia criticises Chika in a very similar way, but the scene loses its significance when the crowd is packed.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that greatly put me off Sunshine was the characters. If I\u2019m honest, I could probably write down the character traits of Muse members on strips of paper, shuffle a few around a tiny bit, and end up with pretty accurate descriptions of Aqours members. Unfortunately, Sunshine also added extra character traits that just make the characters downright annoying. While I certainly liked some characters in School Idol Project better than others, I never once hated any of the characters. With Sunshine, I only liked 2 characters; Ruby because I like cuteness, and You because she really is a jack of all trades. However, I also have hatred towards 2 of the main characters; Mari and Yoshiko. Mari steals the \u2018rich girl\u2019 title from Maki, the desire to grope the other girls from Nozomi, and has the worst voice of all of Aqours. It is almost exactly like nails on a chalkboard, complete with sharp screeches. Yoshiko, on the other hand, suffers from chronic chuunibyou (8 grade syndrome) which leaves her believing she is a \u201cfallen angel\u201d named Yohane. In all honesty, I like chuunibyou as a concept and I actually fell victim to it when I was, fittingly, in 8th grade. Love, Chunibyo, and Other Delusions pulled the idea off incredibly. Yoshiko is just out of place and much more annoying to the point where I can\u2019t stand her. The other characters are decent, but they none of the Aqours members hold a flame to Muse\u2019s members.\\n\\n\r\nWith the gorgeous animation and interesting small town setting, I\u2019m disappointed that I could never get into Sunshine. I wanted more of the emotions that School Idol Project gave me and held Sunshine to that standard. In fact, I likely would have enjoyed this show if the writers never called back to Muse. If they separated the two, I would have as well. It\u2019s because of all of the callbacks to Muse that I find myself comparing these two shows; one that repeatedly caused me to cry and another that was just too similar.",

            "content": "Love Live! Sunshine!\r\nArt/Characters: The interesting thing about this new season of Love Live! is how similar things are. While the art is almost identical, there is a more modern feel to it and the character designs at least feel somewhat original. Unfortunately, It is just a little too similar when it comes to the characters together. For a lot of the first few episodes, I had trouble keeping up with which character was which, and I wouldn\u2019t say that it an uncommon issue. But aside from that things were fluid and fun to watch. The other thing that I loved to see is what thecostumes and the dances that Aquorus would perform. Something interesting to note was that the frame rate picked up quite a bit and that was a little weird from time to time. The characters themselves were actually pretty much the same character concepts as Muse from the previous season. Primarily Chika, the lead, felt like just a carbon-copy of Honoka from the previous season. There were a few other characters that felt like this as well, but Ruby, the character I expected to be like Niko (this was actually Dia), was a very cute and shy character that I don\u2019t quite remember seeing anyone like her in the other seasons of this show. The rest of the girls are pretty dull, but there is some good development and their chemistry together is a lot of fun to watch and play out; specifically near the end of the series when two characters grow in an unexpected way.\\n\\n\r\nMusic/Sound: Being a show primarily focused on music, it could be inferred that the music was going to be good. A lot of the time, there was good and catchy songs that I am sure to play over and over again, now that the season has concluded. I have to say this; the songs from Aquorus are great, but the songs often sung by competitors are also fantastic,  and it shows that the songs were really a focal point for the show, much more than the story (but we can get to that in a minute). The sound here was also pretty well done. Being able to hear the waves of the ocean and the wind blowing through the hair of the girls gave the world life. There was sound that we hear all the time in our daily lives. The idle chatter of people in a busy restaurant and the crash of someone falling on top of other people; It made me laugh at things I hadn\u2019t even seen yet; and I like that.\\n\\n\r\nStory: Have you seen \u201cLove Live! School Idol Project!\u201d? Well if you have, you\u2019ve seen most of this show. Almost all of this shows story is taken from the previous setting. But for those who haven\u2019t seen that or want to know the subtle differences, tune in. Chika, our main character, sees a billboard advertising Muse (the idol group from the previous setting) and the Love Live! Competition. Inspired by their story from normal to idols she gathers up some friends to try and form an idol group and be just like Muse! Unfortunately not everyone is as excited as she is when it comes to singing and dancing on the stage. But when the school is in danger of being closed due to under-enrollment, Chika must gather up her friends and inspire them to sing, dance through the pain of failure and rejection so they can save the school by winning Love Live (sound familiar?)!\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Reflection: It sounds like I am giving this show a bad rep for taking a lot from the original show, but even after I say all that stuff about the story, I still get excited when I watch them because the characters are super lovable and so much fun to watch. Is it pretty much just a re-brand? Yeah, kinda, but it doesn\u2019t make it any less fun to watch. Sometimes I felt like they tried to push a story where there really didn\u2019t need to be one, and it falls flat before the 10 minute mark of an episode, and it just seems unnecessary. I was able to have fun with this show because I love the concept and I think they did a great job coming up with new songs. Is it the best show I\u2019ve ever seen? No, but it certainly isn\u2019t the worst. If you watched the original Love Live, you will probably enjoy this, as long as you don\u2019t mind the story getting too repetitive. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Rating: 7/10\\n",

            "content": "Great historical sequel  , great music and a worthy continuation to love live highschool is what i would have loved to have been saying but cant. Am i  too absorbed by the older generation maybe but it doesnt hide the fact that this anime was good in its own way but lacking in some. \r\nThat they created a new story in the same world as love live was great it was something i looked forward to watch and that the anime did well. They also brought forward what was great about the school idols through the different characters. So in that was enjoyableenoug\\n\\n\r\nSo i wrote that what did i feel was lacking and why did i not give it the review many thinks it deserves. Well to be honest the consept might be what to be expected of the anime but it still doesnt hide that they did almost the exact same thing as what came before it. The character might have been original in their own ways but thats about that. The pace of the story felt rushed and jumbled and at times it felt that there wouldnt be any progress with it. I did like the music to a certain regard but i didnt enjoy as i have had with other idol animes excluding the previous love live series. The songs felt ordinary and i just couldnt say that this was great. The only song i found myself liking was the one that their rivals created while the main characters songs sounded like normal idol songs with nothing special about them. \\n\\n\r\nWhat i advice the ones that read this is that they watch this with an open mind and also without thinking much about what came before since maybe that would help you like it alot more but even as an individual anime i wouldnt give it any better than what i gave it. Its easy on the eye its fun at times to watch but it feels too much as if i had seen it all before. It has its moments of good but it also has it downs which i wont gloss over and say that was nothing.",

            "content": "I love Love Live!, in fact, I adore it. This alone is what brought me to the point of putting time into reviewing yet another Love Live! series and made me patient with its flaws as I enrolled into, at most, an alternative setting that does make a lot of remarks about the previous series and to be precise, from the character standpoint, \u03bc's.\r\nFrom a subjective standpoint, there's a lot of things I could say about Love Live! Sunshine! (and the whole series in general but let's keep it at this since this is aimed at first season of Sunshine anyway) which are nice andI could at least say that I am very emotionally engaged with it for the small amount of time I've been into it, since reviewing requires me to be as objective as possible, which I'll get to right now.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, as much as I love one series, I cannot avoid putting up a proper review for the sake of anime viewers and especially Love Live! fans who want to see more from the series just because of personal bias.\\n\\n\r\nIf you've seen the first Love Live! then don't expect things to be completely different here, because they are not. One could say this is a re-run of the first series but with a different main cast & setting but, Sunshine has some points that make the series special & appealing on its own and it does have connections to the first Love Live! after all.\\n\\n\r\nThe part that is, honestly, a shame is that Sunrise has managed to not only draw in the elements from the first season of the first series to Sunshine, but also the flaws. I truly did hope they've learned something from the brilliant second season of the first Love Live!, but that's not the case here. The plot-line here is almost the same, the pace is displeasing and there's, again, a whole lot of characters who don't give you a lot of reasons to like & care for them because they aren't & don't have the chance to be developed enough for a ~260 minute run, and 9 main characters are already be too much for one season if I do say so myself but, having the idea of how Sunrise works as much, most of this will be dispelled during the second season.\\n\\n\r\nI feel like the artstyle is much better this time, the CGI in particular. Not distracting compared to the first season and Sunrise really works their way around how the environment and characters look in a good & fitting way.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I like is how the first season of Sunshine is on-point with the level of drama going on. It isn't something more or different than what it really is even though the theme is basically the same and something that can be found in a lot of bitter-sweet series that don't have to be similar to Love Live!. Sunshine really hit the spot there.\\n\\n\r\nThe character cast is rather interesting and by that I mostly mean Saint Snow, Aqours' rival group. Since you could say they are the counterpart to A-RISE in the first season, compared to them, Ria and Seira don't start out as the biggest idol group and are the performers or characters you'd expect them to be if you know what A-RISE is like. Though Aqours faces the same issue as in the first season of the first series, I find them to be quite lovable and special on their own subjectively. I do believe they should reach peak development in the second season.\\n\\n\r\nAs expected, Sunshine continues to milk out outstanding idol music that's another reason to why I find Aqours to be special on their own. ''Snow Halation'' and ''Start:Dash'' have been quite the songs but I listen to a lot of Guilty Kiss (I have been doing so way before I got into LL actually) and as I go by more episodes, I can see Aqours clawing themselves in my playlist here and there.\\n\\n\r\nI find myself to be comparing the first Love Live! to Sunshine a lot but it's not like the series isn't doing so itself. It isn't disconnecting itself by any means and, as a matter of fact, the series pays homage to \u03bc's often and, to be precise, from the character standpoint, Aqours.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I can get the low scores for this series because of varying tastes of other people. This doesn't exactly appeal to every audience but if you're willing to give Love Live! a try, watch the first series + the movie and come back here. If you want to see more from the series then certainly watch this! If you can get past the recurring flaws, you're in for a good ride.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I like every single Love Live series, but I must admit that Love Live! Sunshine took a very large inspiration from the first Love Live! cast. I could probably write the characters they're most similar with :\r\nChika = Honoka \r\nYou = Kotori\r\nRiko = Maki\r\nRuby = Hanayo\r\nHanamaru = Rin\r\nYoshiko = Nico\r\nDia = Eli\r\nKanan = Umi\r\nMari = Nozomi\r\nThe characters seemed very forced to be like the first Love Live! cast which was very unfortunate because there is a lot of ideas of the girls to become unique from the first Love Live! cast.\r\nThe story was deffo a Love Live! part 2. Because both of the main plotsare about their school closing down due to low student count except this one is more forced. It also doesn't make sense how a character in the series (Riko) was introduced and how she was able to get into the school.\\n\\n\r\nCompared to the first Love Live! series, the animation here improved, but it looks weird one and then with the CG.\\n\\n\r\nThe music of Love Live! Sunshine was a lot better than the first series. It is a more diverse music concept and the music quality is better.\\n\\n\r\nIn m opinion, the anime is alright. The first Love Live! series was a lot better though. It's just like Mean Girls, the original is a lot better than the second one. except Love Live! Sunshine is quite an okay series",

            "content": "When I heard that there was going to be a Love Live! spin-off series, I'll admit that I was unsure about it. What more could you do with an idol anime like this? All of the stops were pulled out on characters and plot twists in the original series, so how would they make this series anything different? Well, Love Live! Sunshine!! was not really much different to the first two seasons of Love Live, and the first episodes felt like a carbon copy to me; Dia taking the original \u03bc's schedule and slapping 'Aqours' over it seemed like a metaphor for the whole show.\r\nHowever,things took a turn when it came to the episodes about the third years, and I actually became interested in the plot, as well as some of the characters. It's good to see that they didn't just pull off the same story twice, even if a few stretches had to be done (such as the rather improbable ending). \\n\\n\r\nBefore I go more in depth, I'll say that I wouldn't recommend this to people looking for an anime with a strong story or characters, since this doesn't really have either of those things. Despite that, it's a decent watch for anyone who just wants to watch something fun, or for fans of Love Live! itself.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5\\n\\n\r\nI'll be blunt: the story felt far too rushed. This is most likely due to the fact that the first Love Live! series had just over 20 episodes, while Sunshine!! only had 13. There was less room for character introductions and development, even though those are the two things that the majority of Love Live! fans have come to know from the franchise. Honestly, it was disappointing to see the way that the episodes were handled, since mediocre comedy and moeblob moments were thrown in all the time at the beginning, when there could have been plot development instead, which I would've thought much more important. In basic terms, it got boring.\\n\\n\r\nLuckily, as I stated before, the story got much better towards the end of the series, when the third years became the focus. The whole storyline with Kanan and Mari wasn't particularly unique, but it was carried out fairly and made me actually quite excited to watch the next episode, which honestly isn't a feeling I often get. You's centre episode was also not-so original, but again, it was produced well and I felt a sense of enjoyment while watching it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I thought that the story was mediocre, with the characters feeling like a centre point and the idol part feeling like an afterthought at most times.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\\n\r\nAs a person with little experience with art, I can't state anything more than opinion, but personally, I didn't believe that the art of Sunshine!! met the same standard as Love Live!, although there were quite a few scenes that were executed very well in terms of art and animation - mainly the ones shot around the sea. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\\n\r\nAgain, I have really no knowledge of sound production, so I can't judge it knowledgeably, nor do I pay much attention to it when it comes to anime, but I did listen to all of the songs performed by Aqours in the anime, and I have to say... they weren't really up to par. Sure, there were one or two decent ones, but they simply lacked the charm that I have to come to know from \u03bc's.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending songs were both nice, but all too skippable. As well as the often inappropriate start to the ending song, such as the very serious and rather moving scene between Chika and Riko near the end of the anime, where the girls were making a huge decision, and then... the ending song kicked in. And I don't mean the subtle fading-in that most anime series do with their ending songs - this ED just came blasting in at the totally wrong moment. Really not a good move.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6\\n\\n\r\nThere were many 'main' characters in this series, but for the sake of length, I'll be focusing on the ACTUAL main character, as well as the two that stood out to me: Chika, You and Kanan. Most of the others faded into the background the majority of the time, and had weak character development, as well as very little importance in the grand scheme of things.\\n\\n\r\nAs the true main character, Chika may have been very similar to Honoka, but she still filled the role well: she was determined, optimistic and a proper people person. While she, like Honoka, went through a few phases of difficulty and desperation, Chika was still able to pull herself up with the help of the rest of Aqours, and in turn was able to help them. All in all, while she may have been a rather basic main character, Chika was enjoyable to see on screen and carried out her duties both as the leader of Aqours and the main character very nicely.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I may be a little biased when it comes to You, since she's my favourite character of the series, I'll be as even as I can. Again, You was also a relatively simple character, but she was amusing while interacting with other characters, and it was fun to see her being so outgoing and confident a lot of the time, since most of the girls were fairly shy with strangers. When it came to her focus episode, I think that there could have been more evidence of her feelings throughout the other episodes, but it was still done well and wrapped up very nicely at the end of the episode. Altogether, You was entertaining as well as being a talented member of Aqours, and she really stood out to me from the first episode.\\n\\n\r\nLast but not least: Kanan. When she was first introduced, I had no idea what to think of her; she was forever in a swimsuit and she was out of school, yet also somehow friendly with both Chika and You. Honestly, I was puzzled as to how she would join Aqours, since she was so stubborn, but it was particularly well done when she eventually did. The story with her and the rest of the third years was a really nice touch, and I was glad to see that more time was put into developing both her and Mari's characters. Truly, the scenes where they interacted before either of them joined Aqours were very well executed and genuinely passed over the feelings they were trying to show. When Kanan did join Aqours, it was satisfying and enjoyable, and I liked seeing her and Mari and Dia happy with the other idols.\\n\\n\r\nWith more episodes, I think that all of the characters could have had some of the same amount of depth to them as at least You, but for the sake of the plot, I'm glad that it was kept shorter, because I'm not sure how long they would be able to stretch out the story.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\\n\r\nWhile I wasn't always jumping to watch a new episode, or fuelled with excitement every week waiting for one, I did enjoy watching Love Live! Sunshine!! and I don't feel like it was time badly spent. Naturally, I still prefer the original Love Live! to this spin-off, but that doesn't make it bad at all.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\\n\r\nAs I said earlier, Love Live! Sunshine!! isn't something to seek out and watch immediately, but it's something nice to fill your time with, as well as giving a cosy nostalgic feeling to those who are fans of the previous series. It's nothing amazing, but it's good, and it did its job as a spin-off and didn't try to be anything spectacular. \\n\\n\r\nSo, if you are a fan of the Love Live! franchise and want more from it, then I do recommend it. I hope that I haven't been too harsh or too easy, since this is my first ever review. I hope that it's helpful!",

Of course, I am not surprised. The one part of this story that was good was the climax. After I watched the climax, the table has been turned around. That's pretty much it with the story.\r\nArt: 6/10 \r\n- There is a great progression from the one of muse. However, I still can't stand the CGI. It's just... bad.\r\nSound: 9/10 \r\n- Pretty much this is all about the music. That's all I'm herefor. It is completely different from Muse's The song quality is excellent.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\r\n- I expected complete different character from both Muse and Aquors. In general from any show that is going to make a new series, you expect something different. After watching Sunshine, all of the Aquors members literally resembles the Muse. Chika as Honoka for obvious reasons, period, Dia and Eli for hating School Idols in the first place, and Hanamaru and Rin for being annoying with some word \"zura\" and \"nyan\", respectively. Overall, some Aquors members are quite different and as you watch the show, you can get deeper with their character.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\n- All I can say is that if you are going to watch, go for it. No one gives a shit. It's just a show that you can watch for experience. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\n- As much I can't stand the CGI, the show is just for experience. No one will give a shit if you watch this show or not. It is not important as any other good shows out there, although it is popular in Japan. As least by the time you finish the show, you will accept at least one song from Aquors.",

            "content": "there are very few anime out there that are so wholesome that it makes me fucking cry, and goddamit, sunshine is one of them.\r\ni love the first love live to pieces, so for me this show had huge shoes to fill. at first, the show really has kind of rocky start. the writing is emulating the first show, written off in-universe as just chika, the main girl, the leader, following in the footsteps of Muse because she loves them. the studio isn't subtle about the new characters being based off the groundwork of Muse either; whenever i saw a new character i'm like \"oh, it'sthe new nozomi\" or \"oh, it's the new hanayo\". and the pace was molllllaaaassseeeeees.\\n\\n\r\nbut despite all these flaws (and much more, mind you), i couldn't help but rally for chika and Aquors. i couldn't help but fucking CRY three episodes in. i couldn't help but cry even more during the third year arc, or the You's jealousy episode, or the final episode at Love Live. \\n\\n\r\nbecause even with all of the narrative flaws and stumbling introductions of characters, the show aces what made me love the first love live in the first place: its characters. \\n\\n\r\nthe girls of aquors are much more than the sum of their parts. sure many of them are just Muse 2.0 with some new backgrounds, but eventually they grow into their own, well-defined people, with different motivations, different personalities that are easy to latch onto. \\n\\n\r\ni cried in this more than i did in the first love live, because not only do these characters really shine as successors to Muse, they face much more hardship than Muse did in the first season. nothing is really HANDED to them. Aquors fails, over and over, and when they pull through, sometimes it's not through their hard work, but through the loving support of their family of a small town, something Muse didn't have. \\n\\n\r\nhell, the season ends without them even winning love live or saving their school, and they're still just relative unknowns in the idol scene. \\n\\n\r\nbut despite all of this, despite facing failure and hardship and just bullshit of trying to be famous idols from a quaint beachtown, chika and the girls try their best. sunshine shows these girls at their lowest points, showing their frustration at the IMPOSSIBLE odds, their jadedness for having faced failure years ago and having to face it again with a new generation. \\n\\n\r\nit shows that even the most optimistic of the group has a hard time swallowing the fact that life doesn't give a FUCK about your optimism and your hard work; if you're not good enough, you're just not goddamn good enough. and seeing them overcome all of that pain, seeing them maintain the drive to succeed after being thrown out and locked out numerous times, leading to an ending that is just as ambiguously optimistic, was cathartic as all hell. \\n\\n\r\nin all its flaws, love live sunshine is rocky-tier of inspiring, i can watch it and feel pumped to chase after what i want, what i dream and yearn for with no regards to whatever stand in my way. \\n\\n\r\nand that's probably why i love it as much if not more than the first season of the first love live.\\n\\n\r\nps. also i fucking love it because You is the best girl out of Muse and Aquors, don't @ me.",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nHave you ever thought about how important sunshine is?\r\nSunshine heats you up. It gives you nutrients like Vitamin D. It even lights your way during the day, keeping darkness at bay with many a ray.\r\nSunshine, the anime, is not like regular sunshine. But, as it shows, it took some inspiration. Bringing warmth, goodness, and a path worth following.\r\nSTORY\r\nSunshine stars Chika Takami, a second-year high-school girl who has never been a part of something special. Upon learning of a not-so-unknown group of girls who go by the name of \u03bc\u2019s, she aims to take part inthe world of school idols, hoping to find happiness and fun alongside everyone else.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s no question that Sunshine is a fun slice-of-life comedy. Chika and You singing about song lines, Hanamaru impressed by computers, and Mari double-checking that Kanan has grown up prove its comedy chops well enough.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s no question that Sunshine is a musical of sorts. Not in the Hollywood sense where the characters literally break out into song and dance during their scenes, but it does have the occasional dance number. Complete with fancy outfits, harmonized singing, and various musical compositions.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s no question that Sunshine is a drama. Aquors do not form their group all at once, and, during their time together, it doesn\u2019t always go according to plan.\\n\\n\r\nIf one wants, these three aspects \u2013 comedy, musical, drama \u2013 can simply be the extent of the anime. And that\u2019s fair. Like any story, Sunshine\u2019s is there to entertain, and, for the most part, those comedic and music and dramatic parts achieve this necessity.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, should one look deeper, the anime has a strong, underlying message that it relays.\\n\\n\r\nSunshine is very much a classic follow-your-dreams tale. Chika, You, Riko, Yohane, Ruby, Hanamaru, Kanan, Dia, and Mari work together, through the good times and the bad, accomplishing goals both big and small, as they steadily make their way through the school-idol universe. The different monologues on changing that zero to a one, or the show focusing on their aspirations, make this direction evident enough.\\n\\n\r\nYet dreams aren\u2019t the only end goal.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the show\u2019s biggest elements is its spiritual succession to the original Love Love seasons. \u03bc\u2019s does not ever show up in person, but their presence is certainly felt. Posters of Honoka and the gang. Snippets of videos taken of their performances. Constant references to their accomplishments and popularity.\\n\\n\r\nSunshine goes so far as to have Aquors visit the same locations that \u03bc\u2019s did. From the shrine at the top of the stairs to that beach where emotions run high, the narrative makes \u03bc\u2019s a vital part of the Aquors process. Even the plot \u2013 Aquors\u2019 in danger of losing their school \u2013 matches that of its predecessor.\\n\\n\r\nBefore diving into why this direction is important, it\u2019s arguably done to a fault. That the show spends too much time on \u03bc\u2019s, distracting itself from what really matters. Namely, Aquors and their journey. At the minimum, Chika fawning over \u03bc\u2019s for the umpteenth time does not exactly inject a whole lot of variation in the dialogue.\\n\\n\r\nEven if such overreliance is the case, what Sunshine does with it, the purpose behind doing so, more than makes up for any problem it may be.\\n\\n\r\nThe best way to understand this thinking is through Aquors\u2019 opening line in their opening track: \u201cChasing down the path of a dream I\u2019ve never seen.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThe girls of Aquors are following their dreams, but, clearly, they also look up to \u03bc\u2019s. In a meta sense, these idols are following in the footsteps of their idols. And that\u2019s what\u2019s shown. They do the same training regimen, they go to Tokyo to gain inspiration, and they believe they can conquer Love Live if they give it everything they\u2019ve got.\\n\\n\r\nSo, looking up to one\u2019s role models becomes Sunshine\u2019s main directive. That is, their \u201cnever seen\u201d dream is the one that \u03bc\u2019s made real.\\n\\n\r\nBut, the more that Aquors experience the troubles of keeping and forming a group, as well as the different difficulties of following \u03bc\u2019s step-for-step, it becomes obvious that they cannot. Not only because they aren\u2019t as talented or as strong as \u03bc\u2019s (which is true at this point in the narrative) but also because this directive isn\u2019t the right way to go about \u201cchasing down the path.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nTheir first foray as school idols does not go as smoothly as they hoped when almost nobody shows up to see them. When they try to gain popularity by being something they\u2019re not, it backfires in their ratings. Their first shot at a promotional video doesn\u2019t capture what makes them and their town special.\\n\\n\r\nOver and over, Sunshine shows that \u03bc\u2019s is out of Aquors\u2019 league, but it\u2019s episode eight that hammers home just how far down on the ladder they currently are. Earning zero votes, Aquors (still with only six members at this point) are handed a huge reality check. That, no, it\u2019s not enough to just emulate those that they idolize.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s a tough situation to watch, but it\u2019s needed. For, thematically, it not only challenges that emulation but also their resolve. To this end, their seniors help, growing Aquors both in size and in mindset through the seniors\u2019 own idol-based troubles.\\n\\n\r\nWith the group fully assembled, they start to realize that they can\u2019t just copy \u03bc\u2019s and hope for the best. They make a trip to the school that \u03bc\u2019s saved, hoping to understand what made \u03bc\u2019s different. Chika has that realization: \u03bc\u2019s is special because they are nobody else but themselves.\\n\\n\r\nSo, Aquors join hands (fingers, really) and come together with the right directive in mind. They won\u2019t just blindly follow \u03bc\u2019s. Rather, they\u2019ll chase down that path towards their own dream, in their own way, while remaining inspired by the girls that came before them. In Chika\u2019s own words, \u201cI\u2019m not going to follow you, I\u2019m going to run forward, in search of my own place. With everyone. Someday. Someday\u2026\u201d\\n\\n\r\nBeyond Sunshine\u2019s thematic presence, the performances are also noteworthy, for they each serve a clear purpose. For instance, when the third-years join, their dance incorporates their transition from their old group into the new one. Or take their qualifiers performance. The duality between Aquors\u2019 song and Riko\u2019s piano playing emphasize the other.\\n\\n\r\nWhile these parts make up the highlights of the anime, Sunshine is not without faults.\\n\\n\r\nAt least early on, it has too many loud screams into panned-up shots. It\u2019s done with comedy in mind, and it is funny, but hearing Chika scream treads into repetitive territory.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime also has a hard time conveying how well they are progressing as a group. Not in gaining members because that\u2019s an obvious indicator of their growth. Rather, something as simple as showing them practice. They all just sing well and dance well without it being shown how.\\n\\n\r\nGranted, and arguably, Sunshine cares more about its comedy, slice-of-life, and drama, meaning it would rather show off these than \u201cwaste\u201d time on depicting Aquors improving themselves. Still, when part of the anime is about them becoming top-tier idols, actually having that sense of progression is almost required.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, most of the drama itself leans towards problematic. Chika trying to touch Riko\u2019s hand or Yohane running away from the others inflates the current conflict or issue unnecessarily, reducing the drama\u2019s overall impact.\\n\\n\r\nDespite these problems, Sunshine\u2019s personable theme on idols as well as its purposeful performances give this certain set of sunny school girls a stronger start than perhaps at first perceived.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nSunshine does not have the most elaborate art. Especially when it comes to its locations and its backgrounds. While lighting can sometimes play a part in its scenes (most often a setting sun of some kind), the unassuming school, Chika\u2019s home, and the nearby beach do not give the anime a whole lot of chances to strut its stuff. Bustling Tokyo may be an argument against this thought, but it\u2019s not a place that the cast visits often.\\n\\n\r\nStill, the anime does very well in one specific area: the musical performances.\\n\\n\r\nConsidering that Sunshine is about school idols, it\u2019s important that its musical performances are given their due attention. Thankfully, they are.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the cooler techniques is the show\u2019s blending of both two-dimensional and three-dimensional art. The previous iterations in the series used a similar technique, and it works well here again. The three-dimensional parts do not look overly stiff, avoid drops in detail, and provide the two-dimensional segments more breathing room than if the performances were wholly as such.\\n\\n\r\n(Granted, if the creators had infinite time, money, and resources, these performances would most likely ditch the three-dimensional art since it does not look as crisp as the two-dimensional parts. But, sadly, such bottomless supplies do not exist.)\\n\\n\r\nWhere lighting is normally acceptable for what it is during the regular parts of Sunshine, the performances step it up. Firework displays, floating lanterns, and multicolored spotlights dazzle the stages and, in turn, dazzle the audiences (both in and out of the anime).\\n\\n\r\nSuch lights light up Aquors\u2019 outfits which are very pretty and, if nothing else, quite detailed. Each performance changes what they wear: prom-night dresses, traditional-yet-modern pieces, and polka-dotted, frilly creations. The styling, colors, and accessories further make the performances a treat to watch.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the choreography of the dances within the performances are also worth praising. Aquors do not just stand around and sing a song. Instead, they are moving around and interacting with each other. Hand flourishes, winking eyes, pointing, small jigs, and special actions. In short, the girls are a playful bunch while onstage, injecting a lot of fun, a lot variety, and a lot of purpose into every performance.\\n\\n\r\nSunshine is not always showcasing a performance; there are about six in total. So, for most of the anime, Aquors are in a more realistic setting. Here, the anime does well, too.\\n\\n\r\nOn an artistic level, the show creates many expressive faces that get at its comedy. Dia buzzing when the girls are wrong, Yohane trying to play off how hurt her legs are, and Ruby shying away from everyone are just a few examples of the show\u2019s clear aim at detailed reactions.\\n\\n\r\nOn an animation level, the characters are almost always moving. Usually within their own space. Mari running hard in the rain. Riko \u201cflying\u201d over to her balcony. Hanamaru chowing down on some Stewshine. While the performances easily have the more involved animated sequences, the downtime portions of Sunshine are certainly not without their own moments.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the character designs are what they need to be: cute, simple, and not overly specialized. Ruby gets at that cuteness with red twin-tails and a shorter physique. You gets at that simplicity with short hair and charming blue eyes. And Dia gets at that specialization through the beauty mark on her chin.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, the girls are not just one of these details but some combination of the three. And, while they each (besides Hanamaru) wear the same school outfit \u2013 grey skirt, yellowish cardigan, and a bow on top \u2013 their color symbolism continues the strength in their designs. Yohane\u2019s dark-teal symbolizes her \u201ccorrupted\u201d yet sweet side, Chika\u2019s orange symbolizes her contagious happiness, and Kanan\u2019s purple symbolizes her inherent beauty.\\n\\n\r\nIf nothing else, their bright, jewellike eyes are enough of an eye-catch to make the designs worth talking about.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nWhile Sunshine\u2019s characters are not the most complex, they are at least given their own time to, well, shine. Considering that it has nine different cast members of high importance, it\u2019s nice to see them all get something.\\n\\n\r\nNot counting You (since she was there from the beginning), Riko is the first person to join Chika on her school-idol quest. Their initial meeting left them floundering in the ocean, but it gave them the opportunity to speak with each other alone. Riko talks about wanting to hear the sound of the ocean, and Chika describes how she\u2019s \u201c\u2026a normal person born on Planet Normal.\u201d Chika\u2019s words on her normalcy, and how \u03bc\u2019s let her know that even someone as normal as her could go far, encouraged Riko.\\n\\n\r\nBut not enough courage to switch to the world of school idols. For, despite going to Chika\u2019s school and hearing her pleas, Riko staunchly refuses to join the club. She has her song-writing background, but she doesn\u2019t want to give up on the piano despite the psychological block she has encountered.\\n\\n\r\nChika and You help her out. They take her out diving where she discovers the sound she has been searching for. Their small outing together enlists Riko into their group \u2013 but to write songs only.\\n\\n\r\nTo her, switching from all that she knows and has practiced \u2013 playing the piano \u2013 would be disingenuous both to Chika and to herself. Even if she currently views it as not \u201cfun\u201d and \u201cnothing changes.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nBut, as Chika says, she can just try, and, if nothing else, she\u2019ll put smiles on people\u2019s faces. Especially Chika\u2019s. Because that\u2019s \u201c\u2026what a school idol is about. And that\u2019s a wonderful thing.\u201d Thus, Riko officially joins.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, unlike the other girls (besides Chika), she gets even more attention. Later, when the group has fully assembled, she finds herself partially regretting not following through with the piano. It\u2019s always been a part of her, and it\u2019s something that she has always known. So, understandably, the new direction her life has taken, a direction that doesn\u2019t involve piano, does not sit all too well with her.\\n\\n\r\nChika, being the good leader and the even better friend that she is, pushes Riko to continue playing. While she may not take part in one of Aquors\u2019 performances, Chika knows that the piano is a part of Riko. That, by following through on the passion she has always had, and beating that brain block that has plagued her for far too long, Riko will come out the better for it. And, as expected, she does.\\n\\n\r\nDiscussing every girl to a similar depth would take up a lot of time; there are nine of them after all. However, it\u2019s clear that they each go through some type of conflict that they eventually overcome.\\n\\n\r\nRuby doesn\u2019t let her sister\u2019s (current) feelings on idols dismay her. Hanamaru moves away from her lonely time with nothing but books and into a group filled with both old and new friends alike. Yohane doesn\u2019t let go of her chuunibyou antics just because they are a little strange. You gets rid of her jealousy. Chika lets her frustration out rather than keeping it all bottled up. Dia, Mari, and Kanan mend their relationship circle after discovering that they have simply been looking out for one another in their own roundabout way.\\n\\n\r\nOn top of their more dramatic developments, each girl of Aquors has her own distinct personality. Some of the more notable ones include Hanamaru\u2019s \u201czura\u201d vocal tic, You\u2019s obsession with outfits and saluting, and Mari\u2019s feeble attempts at speaking English. As Chika puts it, \u201cEach of us has our own personality and charm.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nWhile it\u2019s almost a necessity that the characters define themselves separately from each other (because having two protagonists who match in behavior would almost always make for quite the boring story), it\u2019s nice to see Sunshine put effort into all of them so that the group is not just a lot livelier but also the audience can have many different idols to root for.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, and technically, these girls do not have much going for them besides their kindness and their quirkiness. And, once their respective episodes have finished, they do not contribute a great deal to the overall story except for the usual comedic actions and banter.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, like said story, looking beyond these superficial traits reveals something interesting.\\n\\n\r\nThe easiest example is Yohane. Her entire episode revolves around keeping her \u201cfallen angel\u201d self. She tries to resist it, and Aquors try to conform to it, but, in the end, only Yohane and her \u201clittle demons\u201d can \u201cdescend\u201d upon others.\\n\\n\r\nHow about Riko\u2019s conflict again? She reconciles with her past, the part of her self, that she had just about given up on.\\n\\n\r\nThe senior girls are the most intriguing. Kanan \u201ccouldn\u2019t sing\u201d which forced the original Aquors group to disband, giving Mari a chance at the future she deserved \u2013 but not the one that she wanted. Mari didn\u2019t want to study abroad because she was worried about Kanan and wanted to help her. And Dia, in support of both, foregoes her adoration of all things idols. So, the girls gave up their own selves to protect each other.\\n\\n\r\nTo put it differently, just as the story deals with Aquors as a group maintaining their sense of self, the characters, on an individual basis, also deal with maintaining their sense of self. This parallelism boosts the strength of the characters by giving them something more than just a bit of development and cute personalities.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nIn a show like Sunshine, music must aim higher than usual. It is, after all, one of its selling points. As such, what\u2019s given is respectable.\\n\\n\r\nMost notable are the songs sung during the performances. They each have the same approach, with the girls switching on and off in individualized and grouped fashion, and the songs don\u2019t extend too much beyond the pop genre. But they do try for something new each time.\\n\\n\r\nThe first official song \u2013 with just You, Riko, and Chika before they are school idols \u2013 uses the constant \u201chand in hand\u201d and \u201cwow o wow\u201d lyrics as a motif that carries the piece. St. Snow\u2019s song takes on an unconventional, edgier direction when compared to other school idols. And Aquors\u2019 first song as a full group takes advantage of slowness, simple guitar strings, and a cultural presence that turns it into arguably the best of the songs Aquors perform.\\n\\n\r\nAt least within the plot of the anime. For the opening track stands above the rest. It\u2019s a cheerful, optimistic, and exuberant song due to the harmonizing of the group, the quickness of the beat, and the loud yet light instrumental work. Plus, it\u2019s just catchy to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nThe original soundtrack also deserves its own praise. While the performances are obviously more complex, and the tracks themselves are nothing too fancy, they get at the sincerity and hopefulness that Sunshine strives for. In particular, the OST\u2019s use of trumpets, flutes, pianos, acoustic guitars, and chimes create, if nothing else, a set of thoughtful pieces.\\n\\n\r\nReturning in this iteration of Love Live is the eponymous transition. It\u2019s a small, albeit expected, inclusion, but it brings back the charm of the series with ease.\\n\\n\r\nThe ED isn\u2019t awful, but, again, this anime is a musical one, so it needs to bring it. But not much was brought. It gets points for switching up who is singing the song almost every time (meaning there are as many as thirteen variations) and for the slight shift in composition near its tail end. But it lacks the oomph necessary to make it a memorable piece let alone a comparable one to its other offerings.\\n\\n\r\nAs for voice acting, Sunshine has one too many have-the-girls-make-an-audible-sound-to-indicate-inclusion moments. But since the women who portray the girls of Aquors are each in their first-ever major role in an anime \u2013 an impressive feat to have nine simultaneous newcomers fitting their characters \u2013 it could have been a whole lot worse.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nThis series is one that I watched early on in my writing career. It wasn\u2019t one of the very first anime that I reviewed, but it was when I was still learning the ropes and establishing myself as a critic.\\n\\n\r\nYears later, I find myself reviewing a part of the series again. And, thankfully, it was just as entertaining \u2013 if not more so.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the biggest positives is the cast. While I don\u2019t value them all the same, I do like them each to some extent. They bring their own flair and their own comedy, providing many chances for me to find something funny (which I almost always did). To put it differently, I did not find myself disliking any member of the cast.\\n\\n\r\nI thought that was going to happen for some of the plainer members like Chika, Mari, and You. But it didn\u2019t. Chika\u2019s unending determination, Mari\u2019s silliness, and You\u2019s need to salute the others made them fun in their own way.\\n\\n\r\nIf I had to choose my top three favorites, they would be Yohane, Hanamaru, and Kanan. Yohane because of her chuunibyou, Hanamaru because of her reactions, and Kanan because of her attractiveness. Again, I like them all, but these three are ahead of the rest.\\n\\n\r\nSome of the funniest scenes to me were when they were depicted in their childhood. They occasionally appeared, but they were hilarious nevertheless. Kanan\u2019s way of pronouncing \u201chug\u201d when first meeting Mari, Dia getting a phobia of Tokyo, and Hanamaru\u2019s \u201cIt\u2019s the future!\u201d exclamation when first encountering a nighttime spotlight each made me smile.\\n\\n\r\nI even got emotional near the anime\u2019s final couple of episodes. When the group declared that they would follow their own path and not \u03bc\u2019s, and their closing song where they recapped how they got to where they are now, I was happy to see them going for and succeeding at accomplishing their dreams.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I really liked the performances. More so than I probably should. Their exaggerated moves were cute to see and fun to watch. I even found myself mimicking them here and there. (And no, there\u2019s no video of that.)\\n\\n\r\nBasically, I had an awesome time yet again with this series.\\n\\n\r\nLove Live! Sunshine!! sings with all its heart. A strong theme on following one\u2019s idols, a diverse cast of characters, and both nice-looking and well-sounding musical performances add up to equal a strong start for the girls of Aquors. Come rain or shine, their future is a sunny one indeed.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fine, while the more dramatic conflicts miss the punch and some of the finer details lack finesse, a theme on being inspired by one\u2019s idols provides a strong foundation for Aquors to begin their own journey\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Good, okay artistic direction, well-crafted performances, above-average actual animation, expressive faces, and nice character designs\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, the girls of Aquors each get time to shine, carrying its theme on maintaining one\u2019s self\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fine, good OP, bad ED, okay OST, okay VA performances, and good insert songs\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Great, fun characters, nice comedy, emotional moments, and entertaining performances\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 7/10",

            "content": "Love Live! Sunshine!! struggled with its first season, at least mostly for the first half. The first half of this season is all over the place. It starts off promising enough but gets really confused with what it wants to be. It obviously wants to be a good successor to the original Love Live! So much so that they mention how great \u00b5's is so many times you'll get sick of it after Episode 6. It's as if the writers thought that if they didn't keep bringing up \u00b5's, it would alienate original fans and get them mad, but it really takes a toll onthe early episodes. Personally, I think all the \u00b5's praise could've been left in the first episode or two and slightly mentioned later. There are sometimes it actually helps the story to mention \u00b5's like the hilarious intercom scene with Dia, but it mostly hampers the show. Great character moments are not only limited by all the \"\u00b5's is so great\" speeches but by the plot which felt like it was sometimes just forced sometimes just to add tension where there wasn't any needed. I'm talking about a specific plot they add a bit towards the mid of the 1st half (you'll know when you see it). It's lazily done and the show would've been improved with less plot, which was the least fun part of the previous Love Live! too. The first half of the season isn't unwatchable thanks to the fun characters but it will turn a lot of people off and almost turned me off of the show if it weren't for the previously mentioned characters and music.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is fun about Love Live! is the characters and the music. And where Love Live! Sunshine!! completely fails at story (at least at first), it succeeds in making lovable characters you care for and really great and catchy musical numbers. The characters and the music really carried me through the first half. As for the second half, this is where things get better and the reason why I didn't give story a 1. It seems halfway through the show the writers remembered how to do pacing and after the really good Episode 7 and 8, Love Live! Sunshine!! slows down for once to give us more character-focused episodes and fun moments that let the members really shine and it's because of these moments that I was still able to enjoy the show a lot (Yohane is best girl).\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, in conclusion, Love Live! Sunshine!! starts out rough but if you stick through it, you'll find a really enjoyable show that gets better as it continues. Season 2 isn't finished yet but it has already surpassed my expectations and is turning out to be as good, if not better, than the original Love Live! Season 2 so I'll leave it to you but I'd still recommend it to people who like slice of life, character-centric shows, with good music.",

Love Live Sunshine.. the successor to Love Live... being a fan of the original, I have to admit I was pretty skeptical yet excited about this new project surrounding the Aqours girls. I have to say.. I was sort of disappointed..\r\nStory: 5/10\r\nNothing special! The same old save the school plot.. And there was only one episode I loved, Episode 11. My most hated episode was Episode 13 and Episode 12. I somewhat managed to like all the other episodes.\r\nArt: 8/10\r\nNow I really LOVED Sunshine's art! I think it's even better than the original! The CG has improved a bit, not much. However I'm notoverly fond of Mari and Riko's design, ESPECIALLY Mari's.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nThe music is awesome! It's on par with the original music, in my honest opinion~ there are some songs I didn't like, but overall it was awesome. The background music during emotional scenes was well done!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10\\n\r\nI originally intended to give this a 4 but I realized that the girls are 9 but the total score is 10, so I thought it would be unfair so I ended up giving them an extra point. Yep, many may disagree. But I honestly don't care about Mari, Yohane, Maru, Kanan, Riko that much. They are all my worst girls. I love the other four girls though.\\n\r\nMy ranking? Would go like this:\\n\r\nYou > Dia > Chika = Ruby > Maru= Kanan >>> Yohane = Mari >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Riko\\n\r\nSorry Riko.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nI always thought Muse was less comedy and more seriousness. However with Aqours I think the girls are more goofy and used for comedic purposes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nI think it was a decent successor to the original. But this is all just my opinion~",

School Idol Project will be referred as Love Live/ original and Love Live Sunshine will just be called Sunshine in this review. \r\nI'm sorry to say but this was garbage compared to Love Live! School Idol Project. \r\nLet's start with the story: The show is about a girl who decided to become a school idol in order to stop her school from closing down. Sounds familiar? Well yes, it's the same fucking plot of the original\r\nThere was absolutely nothing new. They tried to create drama and tension when Riko's piano recital coincidentally happened to be on the sameday of the Love Live Qualifiers but even that did nothing to splash some excitement. They even tossed in a lesbian fanservice \"suki suki moe moe daisuki\" that did absolutely nothing for the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is trying so hard to become Love Live and they are not even trying to hide it. \\n\\n\r\nThe story doesn't grip you. I remember on the original, when Muse first had their live and no one showed up and when all of them sang Start Dash together for the first time. There were goosebumps, there was joy. And when their classmates helped them get in time for their performance in the middle of a snow storm so they can can sing Snow Halation. I felt a lot of emotions unlike while I'm watching Sunshine. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, what the FUCK was that cringey monologue at the end? If you were going to monologue the entire story on the last episode then I shouldn't have bothered wasting my time on episodes 1-12!\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to characters, like the fucking story it was a copy cat. The character designer could have made characters with more original features. Chika is Honoka, You looks like Hanayo, Riko is obviously Maki, Mari is Alice chan and Eli, Dia is a mix of Umi and Eli's personality. Aside from that, the characters failed to make the viewer (ME) give a shit about them. There was no emotional attachment to these characters what so ever. They were very dull and unrelatable. Overall the characters are flat flat flat!\\n\\n\r\nLastly, the music. Now, I'll be honest, I'm not really musically inclined. But, Sunshine's soundtrack didn't really stay with me unlike Love Live. The lyrics were not very good and it felt like it didn't fit with the melody. Speaking of melody, their music was not catchy at all. I didn't find myself repeating the songs in my head. I was so disappointed because the music was one of my favorite part about Love Live. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Sunshine was a pathetic copy cat of the original that was made to milk in more money from the die hard Love Live fans.",

            "content": "I give this 9 ? Really ? A school idol story with being shadow by u's and i give it 9 ?\r\nHere my opinion about this series :\r\n1. Story\r\nProtagonist, Chika, willing to form a school idol group in her shool because she like u's and want to be them. Following then with same problem with series before, school will be closed out because not many student come to study in their school. After all, Chika get 8 other girls and form Aqours to compete in Love Live.\r\nWell, the story itself make you wonder \"is it copy paste from first Love Live series ?\". But, theymake good story in this series. The school closed case give more logic in this series, because they're live in small city and many family want their child to study in prestige school. Their recruit system also good, not forced like in First Love Live.\\n\r\nAnd what are supposed they do ? They compete in Love Live like we know, but hey the result was not good. And they're not give up (like Honoka, sorry to mock you but i still hate you), still doing their job to getting better and paid off in the end. I also love their passion, not to win Love Live for first, but just get 1 vote and enjoying their performances.\\n\\n\r\nStandard but good story telling after all.\\n\\n\r\n2. Art\\n\r\nFor first impression (not in anime), I'm not like it. The first love live had more good looking girl like Umi, Maki, and Kotori. But after one episode, i'm getting used to the art, and make me like it more. Art style was same like first love live, but sunshine's art feels more real for me.\\n\\n\r\n3. Sound\\n\r\nSoundtrack was great, i like all the song.  \\n\\n\r\n4. Character\\n\r\nI love all character. Chika being the great leader is most improvement from this series. And other character was lovely too. They even often make a joke about other member, like Yoshiko and Riko antics. I hope i can see Hanamaru read a book again if they plan to make 2nd season.\\n\\n\r\n5. Enjoyment\\n\r\nThis series is my most beloved from Summer 2016. I can't describe my enjoyment waiting one week just to watch this series. It's kinda sad I couldn't see Yohane any more now.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this series was my great pleasure. They are embodied that title \"Sunshine\", they are bright like a sunshine and keep thier enjoying life.",

            "content": "Love Live! Sunshine!! is the sequel to the first seasons of Love Live. Though the school idol group, Aqours, has a completely different cast of characters and the setting is no longer at Otonokizaka high school, the show on the surface felt like a carbon copy of its prequel.\r\nStory: 3/10\r\nThough Love Live isn't known for its story, Sunshine's story is garbage compared to its prequel. \"Lively girl and her friend attempt to start a school idol club, school president denies, main character and friend attempt to find club members despite being denied\". Sound familiar?\r\nArt: 9/10\r\nLove Live Sunshine's art is good. The character designs and settingsare pleasing to the eye, and the CG during the songs doesn't stand out nearly as much as the first two seasons.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nThe music is just as catchy as ever, and all the voice actors did an amazing job. (I do wish there were more songs throughout the duration of the season though...)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5/10\\n\r\nLove Live's characters have been known to be the part of the show that stands out the most, considering how well characterized the entire cast of \u00b5's was the first and second seasons of Love Live. The characterization in Love Live Sunshine can be described as just downright disappointing. Some of the characters just feel like carbon copies of individuals from \u00b5's. Chika is a energetic and bubbly main character that feels like a bootleg Honoka. As the main character, I was just hoping she was going to get some sort of development that makes me see her differently. The other second years also lack development, I feel. Some of the first and third years however, were very unique. (Hanamaru and Mari standing out in particular for me.) Though most of the cast was pretty mediocre, I found it hilarious that everyone is gay af- Some of the characters' relationships together were great and I hope to see more of in season two.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\r\nAt some times during the show (especially in the last couple episodes), I found myself getting pretty bored. After plenty of teasing, the arc involving the third years I felt was the most interesting while watching the show. As stated above, some of the characters were never developed enough which hindered my enjoyment. I hope season two gives some love to characters who need it. Also, the Aqours cast mentions \u00b5's WAY too much. (On a side note the subtitles I was using kept screwing up the word \"\u00b5's\", so that was pretty funny.)\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score:\\n\r\nDespite Love Live Sunshine's many flaws, it's a decent show. You'll probably enjoy it more if you wait awhile after watching the first two seasons of Love Live. You'll probably find a character or two to get attached to and ultimately find yourself enjoying the show and that character's antics. It was shit- but I liked it regardless, if that makes any sense. Love Live Sunshine gets a 7/10 from me.",

            "content": "A new Love Live series? To be honest, I was initially skeptical about the entire idea of a new cast of nine members. How could you make and entirely new show, based on the same premises with a different cast of characters? Unfortunately, these questions I asked myself after watching the original series, before watching sunshine, took awhile to answer.\r\n          And that is because Love Live Sunshine has an extremely weak introduction. Right from the first episode, Sunshine doesn't leave much of an impression orleave you wanting or craving for more. Chika's ideas and intentions were scattered, and you can tell that this is the kind of person she is. In what possible, non-forced, way could Chika develop in a way that compares to the predecessor's series' leader of \u03bc's, Honoka? What trials would Chika face, like the ones that left Honoka devastated beyond her own imagination in her time as a School Idol? Chika's extreme obsession with \u03bc's was also a huge block in the show that was difficult to ignore or get over. The case of a weak introduction is also the case for every time one of the new members of Aqours is introduced. Every time a new character was introduced, my initial impression was that these characters would react and develop linearly. Would Ruby always hold back and be shy? Will Hanamaru always be so reserved? Is Kanan ever going to drop her Tsun side? To my surprise, much like the original series, all these developments in the show progressed in a way that didn't feel like the plot stretched to achieve (other than arguably Yoshiko's, but I think it was okay), which was my biggest concern while watching Sunshine.\\n\\n\r\n         As the series progressed, I came to think that the reason this show works is because it has a predecessor. If it makes sense, the problem with the show was actually the fact that they tried too much to be like \u03bc's, but Chika comes to realize that, along with the rest of Aqours. To me, the fact that they realize this, and DEVELOP off of it was unexpected. With my initially weak impression of Sunshine, I didn't have high expectations for the rest of the episodes, but it is because of the fact that the show developed in such an unexpected way, that I felt like it made up for everything I didn't like about the beginning of the series. \\n\\n\r\n         Continuing on the point that the second half of the series is exponentially better than the first half, the character balance in the show is very good. I felt at least, that none of the characters were underdeveloped for the amount of time the first season had. Dia probably probably had the least things happen to her character development-wise, but I'm hoping season 2 makes up for that. The show is funny at the right times, and when it wants to be serious, it can be very heart-warming. There is also a very real contrast between characters, like the scene in episode 11 where Mari told You that she should be honest with her feelings with Chika, because of her whole previous dilemma with Kanan. To me, the fact that a character LEARNED from her mistakes, and is able to tell her friend the same thing so she doesn't make the same mistake, to me, is a very well thought out and resonating scene. It makes the entire atmosphere of the show feel more realistic. \\n\\n\r\n         That's what reality is. You make mistakes, and things don't always come as easy as you think. Just because you put your mind to it, just because you work hard, doesn't mean your results will come to show. Chika learns this the hard way during her first live in Tokyo. Through that, she gained experience, and the motivation to continue and try harder. The Zero to One metaphor is a metaphor that resonates with the plot of the show very well. This makes me come to believe that Chika's development with the cast of Aqours is actually extremely heartwarming, and well-thought out. Morally, this show has theme that I can very well agree with, and loved to see develop. That's why I ended up loving this show, despite some of the character linearity (GANBARUBI, ZURA, DATENSHI -COUGH COUGH) in the show.\\n\\n\r\n         And Mari's broken English......... Well.... I'll let you be the judge of that one...\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Compared to the original series, Love Live Sunshine felt very rushed and unfocused. The original had a conflict established in the very first episode and gave us much more time to get to know the characters, but while I was watching Sunshine I never really cared about the cast or felt like I knew them.\r\nDuring the original Love Live I was entertained throughout, but Love Live Sunshine just didn't appeal to me as much. A lot of the characters in Sunshine feel very gimmicky compared to the original series, especially Yohane. To be fair, there were a few characters in the original series that Ididn't grow to like until the second season, but even in the first season there were a lot of fun scenes that let me get to know and like the cast. Nico alone was entertaining enough to make the whole series worth it. There aren't really any characters that appeal to me as much in Sunshine.\\n\\n\r\nI mean, Mari can be pretty entertaining, but she barely even shows up for half the show and most of the time she's just filling the role of this show's Nozomi equivalent. Her fun moments are very sparse and short. Wooby and Zuramaru are qt, but not enough to keep me invested in the show. Sunshine was just tiring to sit through, because I didn't get enough time to get to know the characters before they became idols, there weren't enough fun character moments to keep me entertained, and there wasn't enough interesting conflict to keep me interested in their rise as idols.\\n\\n\r\nAqours' rise in popularity overall feels too sudden. It just doesn't feel as significant as in the original series. By the time Aqours has entered the preliminaries, we've only seen them actually perform in the \"real world\" of the show twice, and in their first performance they were able to fill a whole gym, unlike \u03bc's, who barely got anyone to come at all. Even though within the show we're told that things have gotten much more competitive since \u03bc's competed, the fact that we don't really see the struggle as much makes Aqours' rise in popularity seem much easier and less significant as an audience member.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I will say is very good about Sunshine is the art. Everything in this show is very pretty looking, with the exception of a few of the 3D dance shots, which were a bit jarring in the original as well. However, good visuals can't make up for lack of interest in the characters and conflict of a show, so I can't say that I enjoyed Sunshine overall.",

Love Live Sunshine wasn't anything great, but it was still enjoyable. \r\nThe only downfall of this show would have to be the story. The story felt a bit too similar to the original. It was the same as the original but with different people. Also, muse was mentioned waaaay too much in this. It felt like Sunshine was just a cheap spin off of the original instead of being its own show. It would have been much more enjoyable if they had a different motivation to become schoolidols and they never mentioned muse. The lack of an original story really takes away from the overall enjoyment of the show. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough most people will be watching this for cute girls and nice music, which this show nails. The main cast are all cute and have their own quirks, making it hard to choose a favourite. The songs are also great and choreography is animated well. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, if your just looking for a show with nice songs and cute girls i would highly recommend it. The story is very cut and paste from the original though and takes away from the enjoyment in my opinion. If you weren't a fan of the first one you should probably just pass on this. Its enjoyable but not anything special.",

Sunrise knew how to market the girls of Muse through anime, and it shows. Muse is now one of the popular idol groups in Japan, at the same level of even AKB48.\r\nSo now, why was Love Live! Sunshine!! so badly marketed? It seems as if Sunrise didn't know how to sell Aquors. The anime doesn't help either. It is almost a REQUIREMENT to watch the first 2 seasons of Love Live! to understand several references and jokes that the girls make inthe show. Girls are like carbon copies of Muse, with the exception of You. Sunrise didn't have a direction for this show, and it tried to pander to fans and ignore the masses. They have a great concept, and I wish they can do better if a 2nd season is green lit. \\n\\n\r\nSunshine!! isn't really an anime to begin in the franchise. For fans, its an ok show with ok humor and rather great songs. It's disappointing, but the first season of Muse was like this, so I have high hopes that the girls of Aquors are something that can become likable.  \\n\\n",

I loved the original love live. It's one of those lighthearted animes that you can re-watch over and over again, and sound like a total weeb retard by singing all oftheir songs. \\n\\n\r\nThe new group, Aqours started out a bit shaky at the start and it seems like the general consensus for this anime was that it was simply a rehash of the original series. However, I want to try and change that perspective.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nStory isn't really the main focus of this series, so if you're looking for something deep, insightful, and heart clenching, you probably won't find it here. The story starts off similar to the original series, people coming together to form an idol group. However, it's meant to be a story of new beginnings. Unlike \u03bc's, Aqours has to start off against a much harder, and competitive Japan for school idols. School idol popularity has spread all throughout the nation of Japan, and Aqours is starting out at 4999th place.\\n\r\nAqours is constantly trying to follow in \u03bc's footsteps in order to save their school.\\n\\n\r\nThis is the part where most people closed their internet browser and went on to drop the anime, and I can see why. However, for me, I kinda like that sort of thing. It's applicable to everyday life. When you look up to someone, because they're so amazing, you want to try to understand how they got to that point, so you follow them endlessly. It seems more realistic of a plot for me compared to \u03bc's just straight up stomping every other idol without any actual   competition. I mean... even Arise said \"This Love Live will be determined in the prelims.\" \\n\\n\r\nThe drama was also a bit shaky and awkward, while the humor was mostly meme spam... but at least they were good memes.....!!!!!! Kappa \\n\r\nzura PRETTY BOMBER HEAAADD SHIINNYYYY YOSOROO DAATEENSHII fafbvc\\n\\n\r\nArt:10\\n\r\nThe art is nothing short from amazing. (Of course, it was drawn by Sunrise, they can draw ****ing Gundams and crap) But the main improvement here is of course... THE 3DCG DANCING. Honestly, the 3D parts of the original Love Live made me want to gouge my eyes out, and it's really nice to see that they've improved so much on Sunshine. Uchiura looks pretty nice for a setting out in the boonies. The sea looks amazing, and the 2nd and 3rd insert song's art gave me an eyegasm from the amount of sparkling lights there were.\\n\\n\r\nSound:9\\n\r\nHonestly, I would give it a 10/10, but I know there'll be people tossing Start Dash into my face if I do. I honestly really love all of the insert songs, especially Daisuki Dattara Daijobou. Which is the Aqours equivalence of Start Dash... After listening to Start Dash about 2000 times on loop everyday, the song gets tiring. Aqours provided me with brand new songs, that are all pretty catchy. All of them just... eventually grow on you, you learn to love them... (Not to mention Daydream Warrior, because it wasn't in the anime, but still made me like Aqours more.)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:10\\n\r\nThe Love Live series is completely centered around their characters, and Sunshine definitely didn't skimp on the memes.... I'll boil down each character to how I see them.\\n\\n\r\nChika: The generic af leader type girl. I don't think you can really avoid a character like this, she's kind of a necessary evil. Though to be honest, I liked her more than Honoka due to the faces she makes being hilarious (Sometimes annoying af when I see her \":D\"ing my ass when I get 1 SR from a 10+1 pull)\\n\\n\r\nYou: She seems to be the favorite of the Aqours bunch, for good reason. She has the memes, she looks pretty cool, and her drama subplot was honestly relatable for me. You're childhood friends with someone, but here comes all these other people that seem to easily drag your friend away from you. You feel kind of... betrayed, but it's something you'd never bring up anyways... Also You is kinda gay.\\n\\n\r\nRiko: She's the Maki + Umi of the group. She's great at playing the piano and feels like she's just a plain girl, which is true. Her redeemable factor is that... she's gay.\\n\\n\r\nHanamaru: The meme machine. ZURAAAAAA.... I like the way she looks, and how she's not Rin. Because I hate Rin. She also has some pretty hilarious scenes... that's it.\\n\\n\r\nRuby: The slightly worse meme machine. She's the far superior Hanayo of the group. Also she's the small little demon, and I'm going to dote on her.\\n\\n\r\nYoshiko: She's the slightly autistic fallen angel. She's funny to watch, and she knows when to show how much she cares about her friends... (Episode 11 redeemed her a lot honestly) So she's kind of a... fake autist??\\n\\n\r\nKanan: She's super athletic and edgy to start off with. She also has a meme of popping off her boobs in a diving suit... so yeah. Her drama subplot with Dia and Mari was pretty nice because it finally showed how she's not actually an edgy b****, but rather, a caring friend. She also likes to hug people.\\n\\n\r\nMari: Okay, honestly I'm not going to be able to convince people who've seen her to feel any different. If you hated her, you're going to hate her forever, and if you liked her, you'll like her forever. So instead of listing any actual information on her, I'm just going to spam her memes. (If I forget one, I'm genuinely sorry...) NIII NEN BURRY DESUKA, SHIINNNYY, ITS JOOKE, PRETTY BOMBER HEAAAD, IM HUNGRRY, OH MY GOD... OH MY GOD.... OHHH MY GODDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD.\\n\\n\r\nDia: I kinda had a feeling that she'd turn out to be a kind of... Eli clone. Except... not really. The difference for her is, Dia planned out basically all of the events from episodes 1 to 8. She also gave Chika and co. their group name. Initially, I didn't really like her, but after I saw how well she straight up played them... god. \\n\\n\r\nTLDR; lul i totally had legit reasons to liek them 100% no Kappa hehe \"xddd\" this is gud review ty for reeading lul\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:10\\n\r\nI can't stress how much I love this series. It's really easy to re-watch this over and over again. Their constant comparison to \u03bc's is most likely a setup for season two. (And guess what, Season 2 has been announced today..) I can't help, but root for Aqours at this point. They actually have some adversary and difficulties to go up against, unlike \u03bc's. Even their rival group is garbage compared to the top level idols at this point. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give this series a 9. It has some really funny scenes, amazing art, fantastic songs, and danker memes. (and some actual issues compared to \u03bc's just roflstomping the competition..)",
