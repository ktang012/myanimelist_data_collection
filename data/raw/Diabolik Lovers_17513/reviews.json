            "content": "I just marathoned this abomination (which wasn't too difficult considering each episode is under 14 min) and first of all, men: if you hate women and like to see them abused you will love this show, ladies: if you are masochists you will also love this show. If these descriptions do not fit you, you will just be vomiting your brain cells out the entire time.\r\nFrom reading the summary, you would (obviously) think this story would evolve to the brilliant anime equivalent of the Mona Lisa or the Sistine Chapel but no. Let's go through this using the provided elements.\r\nAlright, I KNOW the art ispretty. It was why I clicked on the cursed show. A bunch of pretty boys with awesome gradient hair. This is how the creators (satan) draw you in. DO NOT FALL FOR IT. You will be coasting on the art for 3 or so hours telling yourself the plot will get better. Spoiler alert: it doesn't. The plot is a giant lie. You keep waiting for it to pop up and when it does in the 3rd or 2nd to last episode you wonder why they even bothered to add one in because it is god awful. I laughed bitterly at my naivety. What you will be getting is 3 hours of continuous blood draining, she is bitten by like 3 of the brothers per episode and miraculously, she does not develop anemia or pass out regularly from blood loss even though the boys go HARD in the blood. Also she never has any marks on her neck when the next guy has a go unless it is valuable for them to notice (eg. \"oh I see so-and-so has already been here, what a guy...\"). There was even a scene where one vampire bit her then when he went to bite her again the previous marks were already gone. What else can I say about the story, nothing else happens.\\n\r\nSound: Alright, prepare for a buttload of awkward sucking sounds. Even when they are licking her neck there is slurping sounds, as if they can't contain their vampiric saliva and have to constantly be sucking it back, it is horrifying. I can't comment on the music because it was not memorable. As for the voices, very nice selection, good choice of voice actors if anything (I am being genuine), sometimes it masks the horrible words coming from their mouths (only not really). As for the dialogue... just a repeat of moans and comments on the flavour of her blood, etc.\\n\r\nCharacters: Our main girl is a mediocre dunce who is having a really difficult time realizing these dudes are just scumbags. Every time she approaches a guy she is shocked that he soon after sucks her blood. She has no spine so she usually lets him have his way with her after which she runs off scared only to come back and repeat the process. One vampire, the only tolerable one, even gives her the opportunity to leave but she stays to try and figure out the plot (haha fool). As for the guys: scumbags with varying levels of sociopathic and sadistic tendencies. One character lays around all episode sounding tired while another with bipolar schizophrenia (and most inclined to be a serial killer of the bunch) stabs the crap out of his potatoes while laughing maniacally. Each of the 5 brothers are drawn to her but there is only one romantic connection really (and it's with the most rape-y of the vampires, of course) and it is also quite pathetic and shallow (this can be considered our character development). There is not any meaningful interaction between the boys and our heroine other than blood letting and beating around the bush pretending there is a plot (yet she still cares about them). One guy even comes up with a misogynistic nickname for the main character on the spot that is so offensive and out of nowhere I almost spit out my beverage. It doesn't help that he uses it like 7,000,000,000 (+/-) times over the course of the anime. None of the characters are especially likeable, they are all quite horrible and I wanted them all to die.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: You will laugh, you will cry, you may stab yourself through the chest with a silver knife. Regardless, you WILL wonder how you managed to watch all 12 episodes in one sitting (I hate myself). My final spoken word as the last episode came to an end was a incredulous \"what\" because I literally had no idea what happened in the end.\\n\r\nDisregarding all math that would give the correctly balanced final rating, I throw all numbers out the window and give it a 2. It could have borderlined on a 3 thanks to the art but \"dreadful\" suits this anime much better than \"poor\". Only use this anime as a tool of revenge.",

            "content": "This series....or rather this abomination is what I would call a trainwreck that never had itself on rail. Visual novels aren\u2019t easy to adapt. In fact, recent years has shown that many anime series never lives up to its original material that result in disappointed fans. However, there are also some VN adaptations that are so horrid, so atrocious, so dreadful, so disastrous, so unappealing that it can be in a category of its own. Diabolik Lovers belongs to the category for failure with all its rights. This show is something of a tragedy - an anime adaptation that is almost an insult to thebrain to watch. \\n\\n\r\nDiabolik Lovers is an anime series adapted from the visual novel of the same name. Zexcs handles its production and from one of their more recent notorious series known as Aku no Hana (Flowers of Evil), it\u2019s their chance to step up to the plate again. But only this time, we deal not with a gym clothes but instead with vampires.\\n\\n\r\nThe series begins with a young girl named Yui Komori who we know almost nothing about. Well, on the surface, we know that she seems to be a normal girl with a sweet personality. However, I would describe Yui as an empty doll. Why? Well it\u2019s because she is constantly being played by the guys of this show. She takes the role of a toy and the boys just loves to have their play time. Of course, the guys that plays with her aren\u2019t exactly normal. No in fact, they are vampires. They view Yui as a meal nearly every time their eyes are set on her. She is their happy meal and they\u2019re loving it.\\n\\n\r\nYui also gets treated by the vampire boys as almost a dog on a leash. In essence, she becomes exactly what a frail girl is - helpless, pathetic, and unresisting. On various occasions, she tries to get out of her situation typically involving rape-like scenarios but finds it ever so difficult to do so. It\u2019s a story gone wrong with Yui being the heroine. No matter how girlish she is, there\u2019s no limit on her stupidity and how she deals with her new lifestyle. Whether it\u2019s at home or at school, she submits to her tormentors without ever trying to escape. To make matters worse, she even compliments on the guys in hopes of getting a break. The result though? Vampire rape, hickeys, and blood scars.\\n\\n\r\nAs an anime series aimed at a female audience, I suppose the guys have some appealing features. Most of them are designed to look aristocrats and behaves as such. In their minds, they are the masters of the mansion and Yui is their dog. The only difference is that instead of the guys feeding them, it\u2019s the other way around. Most of them have contrasting personalities ranging from Shu\u2019s laziness, Reiji\u2019s demanding attitude, Ayato\u2019s aggressiveness, Kanato\u2019s unstable mind, and Raito\u2019s sadism. Regardless their differences though, they all want one thing: Yui\u2019s blood.\\n\\n\r\nThe construction of the story is absolutely ridiculous. There is almost no plot development or characterization; there is never in fact any character development since all of them sees Yui as food with their vampiric eyes. Most of the early episodes focuses on the guys whom each gets his chance to spend some time with Yui. These usually end up with Yui losing blood and crying herself to tears. Are we supposed to feel sorry for the girl? Perhaps but with what she\u2019s doing, there\u2019s a complete sense of hopelessness for her. Each of the guys also seems to have some sort of history as demonstrated by occasional flashback scenes played throughout the series. Unfortunately, it\u2019s never really fully explored so it\u2019s up to viewers to guess in their heads. The story itself also assumed contain a form of romance but usually comes out in an atrocious way that leaves a bad taste in my mouth. \\n\\n\r\nArtwork wise, there\u2019s nothing really special with the way the characters are designed besides their outfits. Their eyes reflects those of a vampires so some of them are noticeable. The mansion the characters live in has some artistic value with an English-like architectural design. Unfortunately, the atmosphere of the series obliterates any sense of artistic value since it twists around the idea of sexual abuse. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is mediocre at best with an eerie like background. The way the show handles itself hardly comes as any special in terms of OST because most of the time, you\u2019ll be listening Yui fighting for her life and screaming her lungs out. The screams she lets out is a cry for help but no one ever comes. I do give some credit to the ED song though as it creates a sense of darkness. Additionally, the show\u2019s sadistic voice tones of Ayato and Raito gets the job done in that field.\\n\\n\r\nDiabolik Lovers is the perfect example of how to not adapt a shoujo anime series based off a game. The shows\u2019 sadism and vampire rape tones is almost an insult to viewers itself. Yui is one of those characters that is unbearable to watch. At various times, I found myself siding with the vampires since they at least have a control of their characters\u2019 degree. Oh and the humor? It\u2019s blend as dry paint. It tries to add some humor to its dialogues but this comes out as awkward and senseless. Thank goodness each episode is less than the typical 24 minutes or I would of screamed my lungs out for it to be over. Ultimately, I did stick around the show to see how it developed or ended. Unfortunately, it proves once again just how much of an abomination it really is. \\n",

            "content": "(It says I only watched 1/12 episodes but I finished most of it, couldn't force myself to watch last few though; so I'd say this review holds valid.)\r\nAnyway,\r\nI'm not going to lie, I watched this because I love reverse harems, and I *ehem* adore nicely drawn male characters. But this?! This is an insult to all my brain cells.\r\nThe plot isn't even worth mentioning because there isn't any. This anime is so pointless and consists of the female walking around getting her blood drained like 5 million times. How is she not dead? This anime is rate r because there are a lot ofpotential rape scenes. The girl and some vampire always looks like they will engage in some non-consensual borderline sexual activity. There's no real development in anything. So in conclusion? The plot sucked, was lacking. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters were the ones that made me feel my IQ points slip. We don't know much about the characters and can really only distinguish them by the clothing, really, and as the story drags on we don't learn much either. \\n\r\nThe female protagonist in here is just so STUPID. I yell WTF at least six times an episode and have to resist the urge to beat the shiii out of the characters at least seven. The girl has no personality and there's no character development at all. She's a walking blood bank. She's a self degrading, masochistic, idiotic, helpless, useless, vulnerable,  terrible main character that gets borderline raped every so often. You know those useless girl characters that go KYYAAAAA, well here you go. \\n\r\nThe guys aren't even worth mentioning. Those hot sadistic mature males in all other animes are not here. Here lies a bunch of cocky ass, jerkwads. Need I say more?  \\n\\n\r\nI mean if you're a masochistic being yourself and once in a while like to feel angst and watch horrible anime, hey, do your thing and watch this, nobody's going to judge you.\\n\\n\r\nBut don't say I didn't warn you.",

            "content": "I was going to do a first impressions review of this show, but I've decided to play a different tune for this one. What seemed to be a harmless vampire romance at first glance, turned into something much more sinister that left my stomach turning.\nThe show follows Yui who ends up in a house full of vampires as she was directed to by her father. But now that she had fallen down the rabbit hole there is absolutely no escape for her. All the vampire brothers there keep her as their sadistic prisoner, each taking turns at torturing her. It's not surprising for vampires totake advantage of the living, but this show takes it to a whole other level by giving all the vampire characters absolutely no humanity. They literally torture her one by one and enjoy doing it. And of course, in typical vampire fashion there are sexual undertones, but this is no undertone, they underline rape quite clearly. I found myself being very angry by the end of the 5 episodes as it just turned from ugly to hideously uncomforting. I thought there would be at least one redeeming moment over the 5 episodes, but no. She is helpless, tries to get away, and is taken advantage of. It is disgusting.\\n\\n\nAlthough there is something to be said about the vampire genre, about its inherent domination of vampire over victim, from the vast amounts of entertainment I've enjoyed from the genre I have never seen the vampire character lose its humanity and be truly happy raping and torturing someone. These characters laugh at how pathetic and helpless Yui is, and have no remorse for her emotional battery. You might try to argue that this is just showing the vampire genre for what it really is, but no it is not. The alluring factor of a vampire is that it has problems controlling its nature, but will do so out of love for another. These characters experience no love, and from the looks of it, never intend on opening up on the matter. But if they do open up, this show has already completely lost my interest. After 5 episodes of this filth I'm not willing to stick around to find out.\\n\\n\nIt seems like in this anime, rape is some taboo but exhilarating thing. It makes me sick to my stomach that this anime can be coined as entertainment. I have no clue how the otome game plays, but I can imagine it has many of the same elements as the show, making this horrifying story interactive (and I don't want to imagine how it can be worse than this). The vampires refer to mortals (but let's be honest, they mean women) as empty containers meant for the use of the vampires. They even scoff at how Yui must be 'enjoying it' (because all women love rape right?). They have inherent mommy issues, and use every opportunity to belittle Yui with one character even calling her bitch-chan. I watched these first few episodes to get some sort of opinion, and I refuse to promote this sick entertainment in any redeeming light. I'm capped at 5 episodes, that's all my stomach can take.\\n\\n\nUnless you like to see rape readily promoted as some sexual taboo then stay away from this anime. It's bad enough the game it was based on was popular enough to warrant an anime adaptation, the less promotion it gets the better.",

This anime is basically a waste of everybody's time, it's so bad that ill probably get more enjoyment in watching Dora the explorer.......\r\nStory-1/10: Story follows a highschool girl who unknowingly walks into a \"Rape Mansion,\" that inhabits psycho fucks that takes extreme pleasure in assaulting the girl and making her feel like shit. I would rather watch Twilight for a better vampire story.\r\nFirst few eps just shows the girl getting played by each one of the brothers,great fucking character introduction...... I couldn't even find a plot, as all it was is just fucking douchebag vampires assaulting the helpless girl for her blood, in and out of the mansion.\\n\\n\r\nWhich group of viewers is this anime targeted for? I have no fucking idea. This fucking reverse harem shit just makes guys like me to want to punch a fucking hole in my screen. I don't think girls would find joy in watching other girls getting assaulted, named-called, attacked by douchebags in every fucking minute of the anime either. I'm surprised feminists haven't shoved the creators of this anime in a deep pile of gender equality shit yet.\\n\\n\r\nFinally after about 3 quarters of this anime, you can finally see some plot (Not as it anybody in their right mind would care about the plot anyways). Maybe the creators finally realized the shit they were making, and decided to create some character development that makes you feel more sympathetic to the vampire pieces of shits. Ha, as if. I want these fuckers to die a slow and agonizing death the sooner, the better.\\n\\n\r\nSince i don't want to waste anymore time of my life on this piece of shit. Ill only explain one of the shitbrained brothers. Lets just call him crap, since there is no reason for me to even remember their names. If you ever watch this show, you will remember the little shit with the dolls. Apparently crap has a whole fucking dungeon of these dolls, wtf does he do with them? My best guess is that he probably practices his raping skills on these dolls, cause that is just how fucking sadistic he is.\\n\\n\r\nHis fucking teddy bear, that fucking teddy just fucking puts five nights at freddys down the fucking drain. The little shit takes this fucking teddy everywhere to rape innocent women, or spirits of some sort(Couldn't give any shits to find out wtf he was actually doing) Imagine the resolve the fucking teddy has..... To watch his fucking owner fuck everything up without even saying a word. That is a true mastermind, the secret boss of bosses.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending cannot even be explained, its not even a ending. The creators were probably just fucking tired with this shit, and to atone for the deaths of their co-workers during the creation of this anime. They made sure that the ending was extra shit.\\n\\n\r\nArt-4/10\\n\r\nArt was ok for the first few minutes, before the fucking vampire douchebags came. Everything became unbearable after that.\\n\\n\r\nSound-2/10\\n\r\nThe voice of the fucktards made me want to puke. +1 just out of sympathy of the female voice actor for having to work with this shit.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-1/10\\n\r\nCharacter? Could care less about the character development from being too traumatized by how shit they were.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-1/10\\n\r\nCould give negative if i had the choice.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-1/10\\n\r\nNeed I elaborate?\\n\\n\r\nPlz, don't waste ur time on this crap. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "In the beginning it seems to be a lot of fluff, though as you progress through the show the plot reveals itself. The only thing wrong is that the flashbacks need to be explained more, and there are many holes and unless you read it up on the wiki or have played the original game, you'll be left with questions. The plot itself was originally well written and pretty deep, though somehow when made into the actual anime it came out confusing and somewhat hard to follow, especially when the episodes are only 15 minutes long at most, and it is a full plot inneed of full episodes. Some episodes felt rushed, though the ending was extremely satisfying and surprisingly touching considering in the beginning parts of the anime you'd think the anime is shallow, though it proves itself wrong.\\n\\n\r\nThe art itself was beautiful. The characters are my favorite part. They are well rounded, and best of all, realistic. Realism might be the main part that turns others away. The vampires act exactly what you would expect a vampire to act like, sadistic and hungry. Most people come here expecting a knight in shining armor twilight copy and are disappointed. They're vampires, and act like so, not as a fairy tale. Though this is a turn off for people who are expecting fairy tale men. Unlike others I actually liked the female lead. Like others she is also realistic, not some perfect brave strong hero out to save the world. Just an ordinary but still special girl. I don't see that many vampire series out there, so I definitely won't forget this one soon.",

The main female character, Yui, is treated in such an awful way it's actually painful to think about it. She gets molested and told that she's worthless basically every time any of the vampire brothers talks to her. Even more so, not only Yui does absolutely nothing to stand up for herself (which could be explained by saying she didn't want toget killed, fair enough), she starts CARING for the psychopatic brothers. Obviously though, she's not the worst character in this anime, oh no. It's the vampires who basically abuse Yui throughout these 12 episodes who bother me the most. I get the idea of picturing vampires as they are: cold, heartless, not caring about anything and treating humans as food, but it's so sexualized and romanticized that it completely misses the point! Even though they were supposed to be hot and mysterious, something went horribly wrong, because they came out just horny and gross.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening wasn't anything special, I'll just mention it included scenes of Yui getting bitten by everyone (what a shocker). I suppose the judgement of the song should be left to the viewers because it's mostly the matter of one's music taste. \\n\\n\r\nThe art was actually pretty good (maybe except Subaru's eye on his fringe) and I feel upset that it was completely wasted on this piece.\\n\\n\r\n\"Diabolik Lovers\" made me feel uncomfortable and was the most unenjoyable anime I have ever seen. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who wants to have a nice time.\\n\\n",

All that happened was that the main protagonist, Yui, lives in a house full of vampires and is borderline raped almost everyday. I don't understand how this show would slightly be considered \"enjoyable\". \r\nDo not let the beautiful artwork fool you. The show is full of sexy vampires to draw you in and the episodes are 12 minutes each, but don't let this persuade you to watch the show. It is a complete waste of time!\r\nYou would expect a girlgetting sexually harassed by like 7 vampires a day would leave when given the option, BUT NO! She is a very dim-witted protagonist. She makes stupid decisions and makes it even seem she wants to be in these predicaments. She pathetically tries to get away but gives up within the first few second. She is not a strong leading character at all. \\n\\n\r\nLaito, one of the vampire, is a very annoying character. The show would have been slightly less terrible if he wasn't in to. Almost everytime he is in the scene he calls Yui \"Little B****\" It is very annoying and I wish he would just shut up!\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I really hated this show, the only thing that kept me watching was how short it was and the artwork. I truly recommend that you do not waste your time watching this show!",

            "content": "Don't let the first episode fool you - this is not a romance anime. Not at all.\r\nI watched the first episode and I was satisfied: Yui, the main character, looked cute and clueless and the vampires, she was sent to under mysterious circumstances, were shown off as ignorant and frightening beings. I was sure the story would revolve around how the vampires start to like Yui one after one.\r\nBut no. I came to realized that this wouldn't be the standard reverse harem story once Yui was bitten by a vampire. And how the scene was depicted, made sure there could be no atonement for theact in one of the later episodes. So I set my hopes on the other vampires. And I was totally wrong. They are a bunch of masochists that like nothing more than torturing Yui and kept her around only to suck her blood.\\n\r\nSo I kept on watching, hoping there would be at least some plot progress, when there was no character development after all. Maybe Yui would find out why she was send to the vampires. But even that didn't exactly happen. The story picks up so late, the anime is almost over by then. Maybe that is why the ending felt so unsatisfactory. A lot of things were only implied, but never explained. And some things just don't make any sense at all.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I have to say: I read a summary before watching the anime and it sounded a lot more interesting than what actually happens. And that is the whole problem with this series. I think there might be actually material for a story somewhere, but the whole anime was distorted so much that it's barely noticeable anymore. And it was done so for those that get a kick out of seeing how the male characters treat Yui. I didn't.\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound are fair up to good. There's nothing bad to say about the art style if you like it. And I kind of do. It matches the setting and is unique enough to catch your eye at first. Nothing extraordinary though. The soundtrack didn't really attract my attention, but it seldomly does. The opening and ending songs sound decent.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately I didn't enjoy watching this anime very much. It wasn't boring to watch like some other series - the episodes didn't feel like filler, something was happening - but what was happening had very little relevance to anything. And the only thing I'll remember is that the anime has scenes with rape overtones. And maybe that Yui was called \"Bitch-chan\". But only maybe.",

            "content": "Diabolik Lovers was brought into live action from their original dating sims, leaving the story to be scattered and confusing, as well as forcefully awkward. The characters were dull, leaving us to be unsympathetic when needed be. It would only be delivered to us as fan-service for anyone who was interested in the original game, or was interested in randomly placed perverted rapey scenes, leaving everyone else behind in a disappointed mess.\r\nStory: 2/10 \r\nYou would think that since this is a game already, the story would be set up already for the writers to just cut and paste into the animation. Yet, we were leftwith little to no story at all, and once there was a story, it was too late and was very forced.There was no build up, no story to hold onto from beginning to end. They introduced characters at the wrong time, and once the climax came around, it was too painful to watch, so most people would shrug it off because no one had sympathy for any of the characters. It would make more sense to actually play the game rather than see the anime. I felt as if it was made into an animated series for just showing the supposedly \"rapey but romantic\" scenes.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 4/10\\n\r\nIt does seem like once dating sims are made into anime, the quality of the animation goes down by a ton, although I did enjoy the colors that were chosen, it was interesting seeing their eye color and hair color, it was something to look at rather than painfully sit through a show with no plot. I was disappointed that they could've put more effort into the animation, it would've served a little bit better and wouldn't have been much of an eyesore. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nThe music from the dating sim was transferred over to the anime. it was enjoyable music although everything would distract you from even being able to hear the music. There was one soundtrack that would come up repeatedly once in a while through out the episodes. The soundtrack itself is good and it probably serves well within the game, but there are more tracks from the game that could've been used. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2/10\\n\r\nEach character had little to no dynamic traits to them. The vampires were feeling up on Yui, and Yui was the victim. That is basically the whole show. I will give it to them that they at least tried to stick a story in there, but it was too late and it was very forced. A solution was forced at the very end, too. They wanted us to have sympathy for the characters, when there was not even any material early on that we were able to use to have sympathy later on. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10 \\n\r\nThe only things I enjoyed about this series is the music and the art, although the animation wasn't very up to par. The story was too dull, and the characters were very flat. Someone may have a better go at this story if they were to try the games rather than watch the animated version. There may be more potential placed there, even though, I myself haven't played any of the games. I didn't want to be disappointed, and I wanted to be reminded of an anime like Vampire Knight, but at least there was a reason to everything that was happening. This anime introduced a situation, but there was no reason for it happening. It just happened, and I'm sure that he majority shrugged it off because we weren't able to have sympathy for the characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I wanted to enjoy this as much as possible, when I realized that I couldn't. I was confused from beginning to end with useless nonsense that would only be necessary in the game itself. As a dating sim, you don't want to let your fans down. There was potential for this but it went straight down the drain. There's a balance between romance and actual story that can be accomplished, but this was thrown together and completely severed into two different things. They should've focused on the main plot, while once in a while throwing in romance. It would've been better if the main character, Yui, actually developed sympathy for each character first, then once the romantic scenes rolled around, we would've all felt the same emotion. This show got it completely backwards, and I hope that they can figure out those faults and change it around once season 2 comes around.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Let me just state for the record that this is without a doubt THE most misogynistic and abominable thing I've EVER watched standing alongside the likes of Itazura na Kiss. Make no mistake: this show is among the absolute worst that humanity has to offer and yet... it's just SO entertaining! I'm not even going so far as to call it a guilty pleasure because for it to be a guilty pleasure, I'd have to be ashamed of liking it in the first place. I can safely say that I'm *NOT* ashamed to admit that I like this abomination that was churned out from thebowels of Production I.G alongside Abunai Sisters. This programme can definitely be referred to as \"The Room\" of anime.\\n\\n\r\nWhen you get right down to it, Diabolik Lovers is a series which is just so fascinatingly bizarre to the point where I question who in their right minds at Production I.G thought it was a good idea to even make this programme in the first place. Everything about this series is bad. The production values are terrible (which is incredibly disheartening given that Production I.G was behind such visual delectations like the entire Ghost in the Shell franchise), the OST probably consists of tracks recycled from the visual novel which always fail to set the mood properly at any rate, and the story/characters are an affront to all that is good in this world.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is far too misogynistic and reprehensible to ever work as a self-insert fantasy and it takes itself far too seriously to be a reverse-harem comedy along the lines of Ouran HSHC. The 15 minute runtime essentially gives this programme a 6-9 episode length when you condense it all together which is just laughable, especially when you take into account the fact that this is also a visual novel adaptation... did I forget to mention that? Oh, well on top of ALL that shit, it's also a visual novel adaptation. Lovely. Leave it to visual novel adaptations to provide us all with countless hours' worth of wonderfully flawed storytelling.\\n\\n\r\nYui Komori makes Kotoko Aihara look like Albert Einstein and almost every single male character in Diabolik Lovers makes my skin crawl because of their treatment of her. Despite that, I don't take umbrage with them. I take umbrage with Yui because of the fact that she's a walking doormat who just sits there and takes the abuse. Considering the fact that I also happened to grow up under circumstances where I was exposed to quite a bit of domestic abuse, it's no stretch of the imagination to think that seeing shit like this unfold IN ANY MEDIUM is enough to make my blood boil. In fact, if I took this programme seriously like almost everyone else does, I'd find it just as reprehensible if not more disgusting than I find Itazura na Kiss and yet that's not the case whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nWith the circumstances as such, one would have to imagine WHY I like this particular programme so much. Simply put, it's BECAUSE it's so outlandish and bizarre to the point where it almost becomes an obsession. I didn't call this \"The Room\" of anime for no reason. Much like the aforementioned film, it's unlike anything I've ever seen and considering the fact that it does almost nothing right and yet plays everything so sincerely, I can't help but laugh whenever I'm supposed to take it seriously. If that ain't bad enough, Sentai Filmworks is giving this piece of shit a dub and forced great voice actors like Chris Patton, Tiffany Grant, and even Her Highness Luci Christian to get wrapped up into this mess! If that doesn't grab your interest, I don't know what will. All I can say is that I can't WAIT to hear Blake Shepherd say \"bitch-chan\" when he's playing Laito.\\n\\n\r\nThey say that bad drama makes for amazing comedy, and Diabolik Lovers is the shining example of that saying personified. There's a reason why I love watching bad movies like Birdemic, The Room, Battlefield Earth, Showgirls, and so on and so forth and it's because they ALL provide me with countless hours of entertainment through the magic of unintentional humour. I also love it BECAUSE of the fact that this anime is so tasteless and has almost no respect for its characters nor does it have any respect for itself. This is not meant to be a guilty pleasure because truth be told, there's no reason to ever feel guilty for liking this piece of shit. Hell, I'm actually planning on buying the Blu-ray release with the English dub when Sentai decides to push it out because hot DAMN, was this programme entertaining. \\n\\n\r\nIt's one of those programmes that you have to show to someone else JUST to gauge their reactions, and what better way to do that than by gathering around the TV set with your friends and popping it in the Blu-ray player so that you can experience it all from the beginning whilst eating popcorn and hot wings you purchased from Crown Fried Chicken? This show gives you so much snark bait to work with that you NEED to watch it with someone else just so that you can make fun of EVERYTHING that it has to offer. Now with all of that said, I HOPE you understand why I like this show so much and why you should probably give it a shot. Alack, chances are that most people will just downvote this review because I gave it a 10/10 and didn't bother reading what I actually wrote. Oh well, c'est la vie as the old adage goes.\\n\\n\r\nWhilst we're here, let's play a drinking game. Every time Laito says \"bitch-chan,\" take a shot. Every time Yui acts like a complete dumbass, take two shots. Trust me, you'll die of cirrhosis before the episode will ever end. With that, I'm out. Peace. :)",

            "content": "To say anyone was expecting a masterpiece out of Diabolik Lovers would be a big fat lie, and not just because it happens to be a reverse harem (which, granted, is a fair enough reason to lower your expectations). The premise itself gives no room for one to think this will be remotely good: some girl named Yui Komori gets moved into this mansion full of vampires and they're all lusting after her (blood). Of course, something can always surprise you, but this is not at all the case with Diabolik Lovers.\r\nIt's exactly as you're supposed to expect it, if not worse. As a reverseharem, there is no actual sense of romance between the vampires and the protagonist, because these vampire men are all complete monsters who don't even see her as anything other than some sort of blood bank, blow-up doll or something in between. Of course, since they're vampires, it makes sense that they would look down on our human protagonist, but that isn't the problem here.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem is that despite the fact that they're all complete monsters, who physically and emotionally abuse this poor girl we call the protagonist (AKA No-tits, Bitch-chan, and other wonderful nicknames our token bishies give her), we, the audience, are effectively supposed to be gushing over how handsome and sexy these \"love interests\" are. We are supposed to fawn over these vampires sucking the protagonist's blood, or at how they violently handle her, or at their stupid nicknames; we're supposed to find that hot. Some do.\\n\\n\r\nIn essence, the purpose of Diabolik Lovers is fanservice for a female target audience by way of having sadistic men forcing themselves on the protagonist, who more or less serves as the self-insert, stand-in person for us. The blood-sucking is its gimmick, which we are supposed to find a nice bonus because uh, sucking noises are sexy? (Don't ask me, I don't see it) However, just because this is basically fanservice, and that there are people who do in fact enjoy what it has to offer, it doesn't mean that what I mentioned above is moot and not an issue. It doesn't, at all, mean that the anime doesn't suck.\\n\\n\r\nBefore anything, I'll mention that the source material of this is an otome game, which is basically a galge for girls (seeing as you go after your favorite bishie and it's a visual novel): due to its popularity (yes, its POPULARITY; I get as baffled by that as you probably are right now), it got an anime. I'm familiar with said source material and know that it also sucks, and it was made with the gimmick of blood-sucking (and this one dummy mic thingy that I completely forgot the name of and don't care to remember because that feature's damn creepy) in mind. What this means is that no, this is not a satire of anything, and it has no deeper meaning than it lets on: you are indeed supposed to gush over these characters. If you do, that's fine, but it doesn't make it stop being an issue.\\n\\n\r\nWith that in mind, the fact that the monstrosity of these love interests (this word will be loosely used) is something you're supposed to fawn over is a problem because there is no conceivable way that you can infer romance or sexiness from the actions of these vampire guys, and yet the show itself tries to make you feel that way, which is largely inconsistent to common sense. The situation you're seeing is a disturbing, frightening one: you're seeing a girl, a high school girl, being kept in a mansion by a group of vampires and constantly abused by them, whether by unwillingly getting her blood sucked on, or flat out being subjected to forceful or manipulative behavior. This is actually scary stuff that you could portray or see portrayed as a psychological horror without a single problem, but you're expected to at least feel the slightest of emotional attachment to these love interests. At the very least, you aren't supposed to see things that way because these vampire guys are hot vampire guys, even though it shouldn't make a difference. The realism card must be played here because this simply isn't a good set-up: it isn't good to make the people that are supposed to service you into terrible people because, in the end, you'll be more focused on how terrible these people are than thinking about how sexy they are instead. Would you want fanservice from characters you hate? Would you want your blood sucked by someone you find disgusting (in personality)?\\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't. Even then, this isn't the only problem with Diabolik Lovers. No, this is just getting at the core of why it's terrible; why it's unenjoyable and fails from the get-go as a decent anime. Now, you know the set-up: Bitch-chan goes into the mansion; gets abused by terrible, terrible vampires. That's just great, but what's the plot? As in, what's the story afterwards? Does it go anywhere? \\n\\n\r\n... Well, it goes somewhere, but its actual plot is greatly toned down and basically unimportant. What's at the forefront is the blood-sucking, and the plot only really moves forward by the final episodes. It just doesn't matter, because the show itself makes it not matter. Even when you get the tiniest pieces of information, you get a bishie thrown at you for your enjoyment (\"enjoyment\") and the focus is largely there. It gets to shallower levels than its source material by making you get to know even less of its plot than the little it did have. It goes without saying that as a story, it's not stellar; it's basically abysmal.\\n\\n\r\nAs a reverse harem, it isn't particularly fulfilling, in my opinion, by the problem I've raised above: there is no actual romance to it, even though you're kind of supposed to feel attracted to them, and consequentially, there's no reason for me to like or even remotely care about the guys around this protagonist. You may call a bishie saving the protagonist from drowning \"romantic\" but I call it \"the bastard not wanting to lose his blood bank\" instead, because in context to how horrible these guys are to the protagonist, there is no reason for me to romantically think of these vampires. Context is key here, and rightfully so. Most episodes are focused on one of the many vampire guys, but since it's just one episode and the main love interest is completely and utterly obvious, this feels pointless. You really just get a feel for them, they get a feel for Bitch-chan's blood, and then they're gone. It's as shallow as it sounds, and you will in no way find yourself fascinated, liking or empathising with these guys. Sometimes, you get loosely shown some of their backstory, but it's short, tells you nothing about the almost non-existent story, doesn't make the vampires have that much depth (because it's too vague or unexplored for you to really get what's up with them) and does not in any way make these guys redeemable; thus, no purpose is served with them. Besides, as I said, since the main love interest is amazingly obvious, there's no value in the other guys being shown as though they have a chance. \\n\\n\r\nNo guys \"fall in love\" with the protagonist: they either don't care about her at all, or get possessive over her because reasons. It's realistic (kiiinda; not really; more like understandable), but it defeats its purpose right away because of this. After all, this is a reverse harem, where you're supposed to like the characters presented to you. They're also supposed to like the protagonist, which is why it's a reverse harem; they're all after the protagonist. However, these guys are after the protagonist so they can drink her blood or because they're downright creepy and insane, meaning that Diabolik Lovers equally fails at the romantic aspect of a reverse harem, and intentionally, too. By wanting to intentionally have these dudes be far from romantic, but also portraying them in a way that's supposed to make you fawn for them is the anime's attempt at having the cake and eating it too. Needless to say it does not go well. Of course, to me, this anime fails at its fanservice and supposed sexiness because I'm not into dominant, sadistic bastards and much less into them sucking blood left and right. There is no appeal in having unlikable bishies doing supposedly sexy things since it's not like you'll enjoy some guy you consider terrible doing them.\\n\\n\r\nBy the end, the main character just sort of decides to be into the main love interest because she had to end up with someone and you don't feel fulfilled in the slightest. You feel even less fulfilled as you get subjected to the vampire guys randomly talking in a non-scene specifically made for self-insertion before it ends for good. It's overall a shitty experience, as you'd expect.\\n\\n\r\nThe origin of all the problems in Diabolik Lovers is its characters, especially seeing as reverse harems (and harems in general) are largely dependent on the appeal of their love interests. As I've hammered into your head many, many times by now, I find these guys purely unlikable. They aren't particularly interesting characters: the vampires are all brothers, some from different mothers. There's Ayato, your token dominant sadistic arrogant prick whose existence I personally wanted to erase; Kanato, your token cray-cray shota prick who'll either annoy you or creep you out; Laito (freaking Laito of all names), your token flirty douche and annoying creeper whose existence I also wanted to rapidly erase (you're the Bitch-chan, you bitch!); Reiji, your token calm and strict prick whose purpose seemed more about telling the guys off for not abusing the protagonist in a room than to actually be sexy; Shu, your token lazy and unmotivated prick; and Subaru, your token aggressive (literally) prick who somehow happens to be the most decent of the guys... while still being a prick because of his violent personality. They sound simply charming, don't they?\\n\\n\r\nAnd then there's the protagonist, the most unfortunate chick that's graced reverse harems. You don't need to know her name: just copy Ayato's \"Chichinashi\" (No-tits) or Laito's \"Bitch-chan\" and you're fine. After all, she's devoid of personality: you literally know nothing about her other than the fact that she had a dad and said (adoptive) dad made her move into the vampires' place. What you see of a personality in her is how much she's in constant unease and insecurity and yet doesn't act bitter towards the bastards abusing her at all, instead showing worry for them in certain occasions, which is baffling to say the least (or just downright stupid). She tries to escape or resist the vampires, but she never thinks intelligently about it and quickly fails, and even when given a clear opportunity to escape by being able to deal real damage to these OP vampires (they can teleport, are overall strong and resillient and don't have most known vampire weaknesses), Bitch-chan flat out doesn't take it for stupid, clearly forced reasons (since anyone in their right minds would GTFO, no questions asked). She gets bitten and abused so much that you can't help but feel sorry for her and cheer for her when she attempts to escape, even though you know it isn't gonna happen; this shouldn't be a thing with reverse harems. In the end, Bitch-chan is further ruined as a character you could at least sympathise with for her horrible situation alone by acting like she can ever conceivably care about any guy in particular and choosing the main love interest because the writing demands it, and just being a dumb, Stockholm-ridden protagonist in general. \\n\\n\r\nThe side characters that appear in this show are about two, and they're as important as the plot: this means they don't matter at all except for the final episodes, where the plot moves forward because the anime's gotta end on something. With that in mind, there is no need to write about these people. Instead, it's just better to conclude that the characterization in Diabolik Lovers is greatly lacking in all aspects, and is overall as abysmal as the story it has.\\n\\n\r\nThe art, however, is admittedly appealing. The animation is not amazing or astounding, but you can see the physical appeal in these bishies somewhat (if they weren't all crazy jerks). Bitch-chan looks really sparkly (just her eyes, really) and cute, and I have to admit she's my favorite character design despite having just stated that the bishies looked good. The eyes might be a bit strange, depending on the viewer, since they have all sorts of colors. Speaking of eyes, Subaru's eye being seen through his bangs was pretty annoying to see. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is good enough for the anime, if not a bit too good for it, and the tracks fit it nicely. However, I can't say it was particularly great and it didn't stand out for me while I was watching (if anything, I actually think the game's original soundtrack was far better, but that one was just too good for the series in general, though it begrudgingly fits it well). The all-star male cast succeeds at portraying these terrible characters, as expected, but I mostly found myself wishing they weren't using their talent in something as terrible as this. Meanwhile, I especially wished Bitch-chan's voice actress hadn't started her anime voicing career with Diabolik Lovers since she did a good job and had a really nice voice to listen to. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Diabolik Lovers was an unenjoyable experience I found myself not even able to mostly laugh at (with a few exceptions) due to its awful set-up, premise and execution of these elements, its greatly lacking story and equally lacking characterization that made the anime thoroughly unappealing to me. There was no likable character in the midst of this anime, and nothing in particular one can cling to except the character art and perhaps somehow finding the abusive shtick of the characters and their blood-sucking sexy, which I most certainly couldn't. \\n\\n\r\nUnless blood-sucking is totally your thing no matter who it's from, there is no way I can recommend this garbage to anyone. And now that I've re-written this review, surely that can be better conveyed to everyone.",

My answer, it was because, at first I was hoping that some miracle or something will save the main protagonist ( I'm referring to the chica, Yui), but, the end result was the main character ends up being one of them despite of the near death horrors she underwent in the hands of six bastard vampires, frankly only the life story of them sixbastard vampires were the only consolation here everything else sucks. The art,  well I'm not much into the art thingy, by I do say, those vampires' fashion were too dorky to say the least, that even my hommies would laugh out loud when they see them, also their hairstyle, hummmmm, kinda makes them look like a bunch of dirty old matrons, most notably Kanato and  Reiji who both resembles an 8O year old faggot. Thought them seiyus are good in portraying the characters, it was the opening theme that kinda tick me off, the characters on the other hand, well Yui maybe the only protagonist, she pretty much a stupid one and quite frankly her sweetness isn't enough for me to change my rating for the character category, since most character's do nothing but suck on Yui and sometime they do a some other nasty things. So even-though I've said that I've given all of this anime category a flat one, I'm still gonna present it the way it is suppose to be.\\n\\n\r\nStory: Pathetic 1\\n\\n\r\nArt: same\\n\\n\r\nSound: same\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: same\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: same\\n\\n\r\nSince the otome game version would be more fun to enjoy than this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: same\\n\\n\r\nWhere, I only have two words \"THIS SUCKS!\" \\n\\n",

            "content": "OOOOOh Shucks, this anime was really a drag, quite frankly, I ask myself as to why did I ever bother watching this horrible thing.......I guess it has something to do with the female character, Yui as she was made into this sacrificial lamb by the very institution who should be protecting her and should consider vampires as an abomination, I guess it was my pity for that character were she finds herself in such appalling situation which it involves them Sakamaki siblings, who are in fact a bunch of cool blooded sucking SOB's, so, how do I rate this not so good thing?\r\nHere's how:\r\nStory, art,sound and character: Poor number 3, Oh shucks!\\n\\n\r\nThe story was simply wasn't there, since this anime was based from an otome game, it was pretty obvious that this anime was like playing that game were the one playing it is a really bad one. The art, oh who is the SOB who did the wardrobes of them character? It was a poor combination of classic, gothic and casual, in fact I see them vampires as a bunch of trendsetting losers. The sound, except for Yui, my dislike for the Sakamaki brothers also makes me hate the voice characters who did their role, and, as for the character's, I would have given this part a higher score, but after seeing how cold blooded most of the character's here and Yui's stupidity really makes me give this part the score it deserves.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and overall: Pathetic number 1, Oh shucks!\\n\\n\r\nOk, so at first, I felt pity for the main character, I was kinda hoping that some bloody rivalry will occur amongst the Sakamaki brothers in order to be the sole owner of the girl, also I did hope at first that the church would come to her rescue, but no rescue came just another deep and dark situation that creep into the main character's life. Overall, if studio Zexcs  were playing the otome game, I'm guessing that they really suck, and for a moron (me included) who've watched this horrible thing  from start to finish was probably the studio's way of saying \"SO LONG SUCKERS!!!!!\"",

            "content": "EDIT: REVIEW UPDATED AS I PLAYED THE OTOME GAME IT WAS ADAPTED FROM. And I can say, this anime is a disgrace to the game. The game it was adapted from is a dating game called 'Diabolik Lovers: Haunted Dark Bridal' The game itself is actually pretty good, starts bitter but gets sweeter in the end. But this? This stays bitter.\r\nLet's start by saying one of the only positive things about this anime; It actually portrays vampires as they really are. They won't protect nor love you, but will suck your blood. So if you're expecting a Twilight-like Harem romance, you're completely wrong. This animeisn't even romance. This is a sadistic, rapey and bad anime that you just...can't enjoy at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe story actually starts pretty good. After reading the summary, it already didn't sound like a happy anime. But the truth is, the plot just disappears after the first episode. It's every episode the exact same thing, Yui getting her blood sucked and verbally and mentally abused. Like our classic Reverse-Harem lead, Yui can't say no and always helps the boys. She was literally being every episode tossed from boy to boy. That's all I have to say about that. \\n\r\nEDIT: At least in the Otome game itself, after a while the boy she choose will start respecting and loving her, but still keeping the sadistic and you-belong-to-me tone. Here in this anime they just all stay jerks.\\n\r\nArt is good, colorful but mixed with gothic elements. It portrayed the sadistic tone of the anime very good, animation was also decent (Yup, bite-scenes included) and the guys were bishies.\\n\r\nSound is decent, music was bad chosen but the voice actors did a good job and they fitted the characters.\\n\r\nCharacter is 1. Never given anything so low. The main lead is like a lot of Reverse-Harem leads simply pathetic, she allows the boys to do everything to her and can't say no. She is two dimensional and boring. The boys are pretty much the classic guys you find in otome games, but twist, they're all jerks! They have like real vampires only a desire for blood. But they're still simply pathetic. They do have interesting and sad backstories, but if that was an attempt to make me feel sorry for them, it failed. There is no further development in the characters.\\n\r\nSeriously, you just can't enjoy this unless you like seeing the stuff I said above. It's not a sweet romance story, but a very sadistic story. There is simply no character you will like, they are all meant to be hated.\\n\r\nOverall is 3. If you know what's good for you, avoid this anime. Don't keep watching expecting something interesting will happen, since you will only be disturbed.\\n\\n\r\nEDIT: When will they finally learn you can't make dating games an anime? Yui is in this anime hopeless, while in the game you have the option to sometimes makes her rude or disobey. While in the actual game you can choose between the boys, and while the chosen boy starts sadistic and rude, he starts respecting and loving her. Even in most good endings they end up being a couple or marrying her. Here? Since it's an anime, the boys just stay jerks and never get to know her. This anime gives a completely wrong picture of the actual game.\\n\\n\r\n***Feedback is always welcome :)***",

            "content": "Some anime have zombies. Others have witches. This show has a set of perverted sadistic blood-sucking handsome supposed-to-be-vampires. I've said it. This show reminded me of a horrible Twilight fan fiction, written by a masochistic (and also very horny) woman. I can imagine only two kinds of people who would like this show. The first one is a group of men who love to see women suffering and being inferior to men. The second kind is, like I already mentioned, masochistic women. If you're part of any of these cliques, I'm sure you'll love this show. If not, do me (but above all, yourself) afavor and ignore this piece of garbage. Why is this show so hideous? Stay tuned.\\n\\n\r\n~Story~ 1/10\\n\r\nIs there a story? I had difficulty explaining this aspect of the show in this review, but I tried my best. The main character is our ultra-brave heroine Yui Komori. One day, her father sends her as a religious sacrifice to the Sakamaki brothers' mansion. Why? Nobody knows, and no one probably ever will. Great parenting, right? What Yui doesn't know, is that her new fellow \"brothers\" are six vampires. What a shock! But instead of trying to run away, or trying to call the police (or maybe even the vampire version of the ghost busters) to come and capture them, she stays! Because, guess what? She tries to reason with six guys, who could totally vampire-gangbang her any moment, even though it's completely obvious that they are NEVER going to listen to her. She even stays after these guys have sucked her blood. She even goes to some sort of vampire school, which (for some reason) has never been discovered by the commoners, with them. That's basically the story. A chick with no brains who gets vampire-raped multiple times. Fun, right? I'll list some more plotholes. Even though this girl gets her blood sucked out of her multiple times a day, she has NEVER shown any serious severe blood loss symptoms. Even Twilight was more realistic at this aspect! At least they almost let Bella die when Edward Sparkles drank her blood. Just what kind of magical creature, who apparently doesn't need her blood, is she? Oh wait, I almost forgot. A magical creature who apparently doesn't need her blood and can see ghosts as well. Why can she see ghosts, you ask? No good reason, other than the one that she gets to see the sad backstories of the perverted vampires. Why does she get to see the ghost of their mother? Why does that ghost take over Yui's body? Why does the mother's ghost KISS her own son in the body of a random chick? I. Have. No. Idea. I'm completely lost.\\n\r\n[CONCLUSION]\\n\r\nThe \"story\" basically consists of vampire porn scenes. That's all this is. There is no story.\\n\\n\r\n~Art~ 7/10\\n\r\nYes, I know, the art is really pretty. A pretty girl with a harem of good-looking bishounen. A lot of pretty colors. Looks like it's a high quality show. That's exactly why I clicked on this damn trash. And that's exactly how the director (also known as satan) lures you into this anime (also known as hell). DON'T FALL FOR IT. You'll waste 3 hours of your precious time. And for what? Vampire porn. I won't deny that the art is good, because it is, but please. Do you really want to watch a show about vampire rapists sucking a brainless zombie's blood because it has some pretty colors? \\n\r\n[CONCLUSION]\\n\r\nDon't let these pretty colors fool you. This anime is still trash.\\n\\n\r\n~Sound~ 4/10\\n\r\nI guess the sound of this show could have been considered as okay, if it fitted the show. Why does an anime about sadistic vampire rapists have church OSTs? The only thing I can understand is why the opening is called 'MR. SADISTIC NIGHT', except that it should be called 'MR. SADISTIC BLOOD-SUCKING PERVERTED VAMPIRE RAPIST'. The ending is mediocre. I'm not too positive about this aspect of the show, although it's one of the best parts of it.\\n\r\n[CONCLUSION]\\n\r\nThe sound is mediocre, and the OSTs are questionable.\\n\\n\r\n~Characters~ 1/10\\n\r\nHaha, this should be fun. I'll work all the main characters out for you.\\n\r\nStarting off with our main character, Yui Komori. Let me just get this out there: she got absolutely no character development. She started off as a brainless masochist, and guess how she ended up? A brainless masochist. I'm quite open-minded, so when I started watching this, I immediately saw opportunities. I mean, imagine what the directors could have done with her... They could have turned her in a vampire-slaying yandere, or at least have let her escape the mansion and be the starter of a humans vs vampire war. But nope, none of this happened. I should have been the director of this. Actually, on second thought, no, I shouldn't have been. I would have been way too ashamed of myself if I'd came up with this. I'm already ashamed enough that I've watched it.\\n\r\nWell, I don't really have anything else to say about this useless walking corpse.\\n\r\nMoving on to our six perverted vampires.\\n\r\nMeet the eldest Sakamaki brother, Shuu, who is basically living the dream, because during most of the anime, he is asleep. How does he spend his waking hours? By laying down on a couch, or in a bath tub, or sucking Yui's blood while laying down. Interesting character.\\n\r\nThen there's Reiji, the stereotypical smart guy, who loves reading books, drinking tea and sucking Yui's blood while poisoning her with some weird tea. \\n\r\nHere comes my personal favorite: Kanato. Just kidding, I don't have a favorite. And even if I had, it wouldn't be a creepy 12-year old, who looks like he's suffering from the worst insomnia ever and who stabs the living shit out of his potatoes while laughing like a psychopath.\\n\r\nThen there's the most perverted one of them all: Raito. Also known as the guy with the hat. Or as the guy with the most awkward laugh ever. Seriously, when I heard his laugh, I cringed so hard. I didn't know whether I should laugh or cry.\\n\r\nThen the potential savior of the show: Subaru! He approached Yui, telling her she should run away from the mansion. He even gave her a silver knife to stab the vampires. Just when I thought Yui was going to start the vampire massacre by stabbing Subaru first: nope. He sucked her blood. And she let it happen. My minuscule faith in this show was shattered.\\n\r\nAnd finally, the worst one of them all. Ayato. The guy who does not only suck Yui's blood, but also sees her as his possession. And as if that wasn't bad enough, he also came up with a nickname for the main character that is so offensive that I almost threw my computer out of my window.\\n\r\nWell, that's basically your cast. Excluding some psychopathic ghosts who seem important at first, but end up adding nothing to the show at all. Even though it couldn't have been saved anyway.\\n\r\n[CONCLUSION]\\n\r\nOne of the worst female leads ever, and some of the weirdest harems ever. Like I've said a dozen times already: just don't watch this.\\n\\n\r\n~Enjoyment~ 1/10\\n\r\nI don't know how you'll feel when watching this show. You may burst out laughing, you may start crying (whether it be of laughter or of depression). You may feel like throwing up (like I did) or like you want to beat the shit out of basically all characters in the show (like I did). What you WILL think after watching this, is \"why did I spend 3 hours of my life watching this?\". Because that's what this show is. A waste of time. A waste of money. A waste of capacity on websites. But above all, this show is a wrecking ball that will DESTROY your faith in equal rights for men and women. That's what this show did to me. Because I didn't just hate this show. This show even managed to make me feel personally offended as a female. And that doesn't happen often. This show, however, pulled my inner feminist out. Some may see that as an accomplishment, but I see it as something to be very, very ashamed of.\\n\r\n[CONCLUSION]\\n\r\nUgh, I'm so done. Just don't watch it.\\n\\n\r\nWell, congratulations if you've made it all the way through. If you want to see a show about vampire rapists, ghosts, and a useless girl, this is your thing. Have fun. This garbage even managed to get a sequel. Shows like these make me feel very sad about anime productions nowadays. Luckily, there are still a few gems out there, but this show could never be one of them, not in its wildest dreams. Peace.",

            "content": "I just watched this entire thing this morning. I'm not sure what part of me thought this was a good idea. If you're wanting to watch this because you're a otome game player I suggest you stick around and read this review. \r\nIf you like otome games, I assume you've at least heart of animes like Amnesia and Kamigami no Asobi, and perhaps played games like My Candy Love, Eldarya, a fair share of Shall We Date? Games, and an assortment of other games spilled across the internet, gaming systems, and discs alike. If that's what you're looking for, I don't think this is whatyou want. \\n\\n\r\nFirst off, the story: we don't find out the 'overarching' storyline until perhaps late in the sixth or seventh episodes. This storyline is about murder, not romance. Suddenly, after many episodes of just plain rape, the plot turns into something occult-like without any explanation. Short flashbacks are shown, but none of the characters or backstories are developed at all, leaving us wondering if the characters are all just psychopaths. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is decent, I guess. None of the characters are outlandish to look at, and some are pretty attractive. There's enough difference in designs to easily tell them apart. Some of their eyes are gorgeous, too. The outfits are pretty poorly designs and not a lot of the backgrounds were thought out except for the outside shot of the (mansion?) they're staying in. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound wasn't very good. I didn't like either of the opening or closing songs very much, and since I watched the dub, I recognized many of the guys voicing the vampires as some of my favorite guy characters from other animes, so them saying such terrible and rape-like things just made me squirm. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters were terrible. None had development, all the guys were rapists, and Yui was a blank masochist slate that made no sense. Every single time the guys assaulted her, she acted like it had never happened before and tried to even help them. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I didn't enjoy this very much. I only watched it because I'm an otome fan, but sadly, I'm still looking for an anime based on an otome that actually turned out well. I might look into the second season if it has a different plot, but I really doubt it'll be any better.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend this if: you are a masochist, you like the whole helpless heroine trope, you have a biting kink, you don't care about plot, you want one heroine with a whole bunch of guys\\n\\n\r\nI would NOT recommend if: you are triggered by rape, you wanted a plot, you wanted actual romance\\n\\n\r\nHave a great day everyone!",

            "content": "I just marathoned this abomination (which wasn't too difficult considering each episode is under 14 min) and first of all, men: if you hate women and like to see them abused you will love this show, ladies: if you are masochists you will also love this show. If these descriptions do not fit you, you will just be vomiting your brain cells out the entire time.\r\nFrom reading the summary, you would (obviously) think this story would evolve to the brilliant anime equivalent of the Mona Lisa or the Sistine Chapel but no. Let's go through this using the provided elements.\r\nAlright, I KNOW the art ispretty. It was why I clicked on the cursed show. A bunch of pretty boys with awesome gradient hair. This is how the creators (satan) draw you in. DO NOT FALL FOR IT. You will be coasting on the art for 3 or so hours telling yourself the plot will get better. Spoiler alert: it doesn't. The plot is a giant lie. You keep waiting for it to pop up and when it does in the 3rd or 2nd to last episode you wonder why they even bothered to add one in because it is god awful. I laughed bitterly at my naivety. What you will be getting is 3 hours of continuous blood draining, she is bitten by like 3 of the brothers per episode and miraculously, she does not develop anemia or pass out regularly from blood loss even though the boys go HARD in the blood. Also she never has any marks on her neck when the next guy has a go unless it is valuable for them to notice (eg. \"oh I see so-and-so has already been here, what a guy...\"). There was even a scene where one vampire bit her then when he went to bite her again the previous marks were already gone. What else can I say about the story, nothing else happens.\\n\r\nSound: Alright, prepare for a buttload of awkward sucking sounds. Even when they are licking her neck there is slurping sounds, as if they can't contain their vampiric saliva and have to constantly be sucking it back, it is horrifying. I can't comment on the music because it was not memorable. As for the voices, very nice selection, good choice of voice actors if anything (I am being genuine), sometimes it masks the horrible words coming from their mouths (only not really). As for the dialogue... just a repeat of moans and comments on the flavour of her blood, etc.\\n\r\nCharacters: Our main girl is a mediocre dunce who is having a really difficult time realizing these dudes are just scumbags. Every time she approaches a guy she is shocked that he soon after sucks her blood. She has no spine so she usually lets him have his way with her after which she runs off scared only to come back and repeat the process. One vampire, the only tolerable one, even gives her the opportunity to leave but she stays to try and figure out the plot (haha fool). As for the guys: scumbags with varying levels of sociopathic and sadistic tendencies. One character lays around all episode sounding tired while another with bipolar schizophrenia (and most inclined to be a serial killer of the bunch) stabs the crap out of his potatoes while laughing maniacally. Each of the 5 brothers are drawn to her but there is only one romantic connection really (and it's with the most rape-y of the vampires, of course) and it is also quite pathetic and shallow (this can be considered our character development). There is not any meaningful interaction between the boys and our heroine other than blood letting and beating around the bush pretending there is a plot (yet she still cares about them). One guy even comes up with a misogynistic nickname for the main character on the spot that is so offensive and out of nowhere I almost spit out my beverage. It doesn't help that he uses it like 7,000,000,000 (+/-) times over the course of the anime. None of the characters are especially likeable, they are all quite horrible and I wanted them all to die.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: You will laugh, you will cry, you may stab yourself through the chest with a silver knife. Regardless, you WILL wonder how you managed to watch all 12 episodes in one sitting (I hate myself). My final spoken word as the last episode came to an end was a incredulous \"what\" because I literally had no idea what happened in the end.\\n\r\nDisregarding all math that would give the correctly balanced final rating, I throw all numbers out the window and give it a 2. It could have borderlined on a 3 thanks to the art but \"dreadful\" suits this anime much better than \"poor\". Only use this anime as a tool of revenge.",

            "content": "This series....or rather this abomination is what I would call a trainwreck that never had itself on rail. Visual novels aren\u2019t easy to adapt. In fact, recent years has shown that many anime series never lives up to its original material that result in disappointed fans. However, there are also some VN adaptations that are so horrid, so atrocious, so dreadful, so disastrous, so unappealing that it can be in a category of its own. Diabolik Lovers belongs to the category for failure with all its rights. This show is something of a tragedy - an anime adaptation that is almost an insult to thebrain to watch. \\n\\n\r\nDiabolik Lovers is an anime series adapted from the visual novel of the same name. Zexcs handles its production and from one of their more recent notorious series known as Aku no Hana (Flowers of Evil), it\u2019s their chance to step up to the plate again. But only this time, we deal not with a gym clothes but instead with vampires.\\n\\n\r\nThe series begins with a young girl named Yui Komori who we know almost nothing about. Well, on the surface, we know that she seems to be a normal girl with a sweet personality. However, I would describe Yui as an empty doll. Why? Well it\u2019s because she is constantly being played by the guys of this show. She takes the role of a toy and the boys just loves to have their play time. Of course, the guys that plays with her aren\u2019t exactly normal. No in fact, they are vampires. They view Yui as a meal nearly every time their eyes are set on her. She is their happy meal and they\u2019re loving it.\\n\\n\r\nYui also gets treated by the vampire boys as almost a dog on a leash. In essence, she becomes exactly what a frail girl is - helpless, pathetic, and unresisting. On various occasions, she tries to get out of her situation typically involving rape-like scenarios but finds it ever so difficult to do so. It\u2019s a story gone wrong with Yui being the heroine. No matter how girlish she is, there\u2019s no limit on her stupidity and how she deals with her new lifestyle. Whether it\u2019s at home or at school, she submits to her tormentors without ever trying to escape. To make matters worse, she even compliments on the guys in hopes of getting a break. The result though? Vampire rape, hickeys, and blood scars.\\n\\n\r\nAs an anime series aimed at a female audience, I suppose the guys have some appealing features. Most of them are designed to look aristocrats and behaves as such. In their minds, they are the masters of the mansion and Yui is their dog. The only difference is that instead of the guys feeding them, it\u2019s the other way around. Most of them have contrasting personalities ranging from Shu\u2019s laziness, Reiji\u2019s demanding attitude, Ayato\u2019s aggressiveness, Kanato\u2019s unstable mind, and Raito\u2019s sadism. Regardless their differences though, they all want one thing: Yui\u2019s blood.\\n\\n\r\nThe construction of the story is absolutely ridiculous. There is almost no plot development or characterization; there is never in fact any character development since all of them sees Yui as food with their vampiric eyes. Most of the early episodes focuses on the guys whom each gets his chance to spend some time with Yui. These usually end up with Yui losing blood and crying herself to tears. Are we supposed to feel sorry for the girl? Perhaps but with what she\u2019s doing, there\u2019s a complete sense of hopelessness for her. Each of the guys also seems to have some sort of history as demonstrated by occasional flashback scenes played throughout the series. Unfortunately, it\u2019s never really fully explored so it\u2019s up to viewers to guess in their heads. The story itself also assumed contain a form of romance but usually comes out in an atrocious way that leaves a bad taste in my mouth. \\n\\n\r\nArtwork wise, there\u2019s nothing really special with the way the characters are designed besides their outfits. Their eyes reflects those of a vampires so some of them are noticeable. The mansion the characters live in has some artistic value with an English-like architectural design. Unfortunately, the atmosphere of the series obliterates any sense of artistic value since it twists around the idea of sexual abuse. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is mediocre at best with an eerie like background. The way the show handles itself hardly comes as any special in terms of OST because most of the time, you\u2019ll be listening Yui fighting for her life and screaming her lungs out. The screams she lets out is a cry for help but no one ever comes. I do give some credit to the ED song though as it creates a sense of darkness. Additionally, the show\u2019s sadistic voice tones of Ayato and Raito gets the job done in that field.\\n\\n\r\nDiabolik Lovers is the perfect example of how to not adapt a shoujo anime series based off a game. The shows\u2019 sadism and vampire rape tones is almost an insult to viewers itself. Yui is one of those characters that is unbearable to watch. At various times, I found myself siding with the vampires since they at least have a control of their characters\u2019 degree. Oh and the humor? It\u2019s blend as dry paint. It tries to add some humor to its dialogues but this comes out as awkward and senseless. Thank goodness each episode is less than the typical 24 minutes or I would of screamed my lungs out for it to be over. Ultimately, I did stick around the show to see how it developed or ended. Unfortunately, it proves once again just how much of an abomination it really is. \\n",

This anime is rate r because there are a lot ofpotential rape scenes. The girl and some vampire always looks like they will engage in some non-consensual borderline sexual activity. There's no real development in anything. So in conclusion? The plot sucked, was lacking. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters were the ones that made me feel my IQ points slip. We don't know much about the characters and can really only distinguish them by the clothing, really, and as the story drags on we don't learn much either. \\n\r\nThe female protagonist in here is just so STUPID. I yell WTF at least six times an episode and have to resist the urge to beat the shiii out of the characters at least seven. The girl has no personality and there's no character development at all. She's a walking blood bank. She's a self degrading, masochistic, idiotic, helpless, useless, vulnerable,  terrible main character that gets borderline raped every so often. You know those useless girl characters that go KYYAAAAA, well here you go. \\n\r\nThe guys aren't even worth mentioning. Those hot sadistic mature males in all other animes are not here. Here lies a bunch of cocky ass, jerkwads. Need I say more?  \\n\\n\r\nI mean if you're a masochistic being yourself and once in a while like to feel angst and watch horrible anime, hey, do your thing and watch this, nobody's going to judge you.\\n\\n\r\nBut don't say I didn't warn you.",

            "content": "I was going to do a first impressions review of this show, but I've decided to play a different tune for this one. What seemed to be a harmless vampire romance at first glance, turned into something much more sinister that left my stomach turning.\nThe show follows Yui who ends up in a house full of vampires as she was directed to by her father. But now that she had fallen down the rabbit hole there is absolutely no escape for her. All the vampire brothers there keep her as their sadistic prisoner, each taking turns at torturing her. It's not surprising for vampires totake advantage of the living, but this show takes it to a whole other level by giving all the vampire characters absolutely no humanity. They literally torture her one by one and enjoy doing it. And of course, in typical vampire fashion there are sexual undertones, but this is no undertone, they underline rape quite clearly. I found myself being very angry by the end of the 5 episodes as it just turned from ugly to hideously uncomforting. I thought there would be at least one redeeming moment over the 5 episodes, but no. She is helpless, tries to get away, and is taken advantage of. It is disgusting.\\n\\n\nAlthough there is something to be said about the vampire genre, about its inherent domination of vampire over victim, from the vast amounts of entertainment I've enjoyed from the genre I have never seen the vampire character lose its humanity and be truly happy raping and torturing someone. These characters laugh at how pathetic and helpless Yui is, and have no remorse for her emotional battery. You might try to argue that this is just showing the vampire genre for what it really is, but no it is not. The alluring factor of a vampire is that it has problems controlling its nature, but will do so out of love for another. These characters experience no love, and from the looks of it, never intend on opening up on the matter. But if they do open up, this show has already completely lost my interest. After 5 episodes of this filth I'm not willing to stick around to find out.\\n\\n\nIt seems like in this anime, rape is some taboo but exhilarating thing. It makes me sick to my stomach that this anime can be coined as entertainment. I have no clue how the otome game plays, but I can imagine it has many of the same elements as the show, making this horrifying story interactive (and I don't want to imagine how it can be worse than this). The vampires refer to mortals (but let's be honest, they mean women) as empty containers meant for the use of the vampires. They even scoff at how Yui must be 'enjoying it' (because all women love rape right?). They have inherent mommy issues, and use every opportunity to belittle Yui with one character even calling her bitch-chan. I watched these first few episodes to get some sort of opinion, and I refuse to promote this sick entertainment in any redeeming light. I'm capped at 5 episodes, that's all my stomach can take.\\n\\n\nUnless you like to see rape readily promoted as some sexual taboo then stay away from this anime. It's bad enough the game it was based on was popular enough to warrant an anime adaptation, the less promotion it gets the better.",

This anime is basically a waste of everybody's time, it's so bad that ill probably get more enjoyment in watching Dora the explorer.......\r\nStory-1/10: Story follows a highschool girl who unknowingly walks into a \"Rape Mansion,\" that inhabits psycho fucks that takes extreme pleasure in assaulting the girl and making her feel like shit. I would rather watch Twilight for a better vampire story.\r\nFirst few eps just shows the girl getting played by each one of the brothers,great fucking character introduction...... I couldn't even find a plot, as all it was is just fucking douchebag vampires assaulting the helpless girl for her blood, in and out of the mansion.\\n\\n\r\nWhich group of viewers is this anime targeted for? I have no fucking idea. This fucking reverse harem shit just makes guys like me to want to punch a fucking hole in my screen. I don't think girls would find joy in watching other girls getting assaulted, named-called, attacked by douchebags in every fucking minute of the anime either. I'm surprised feminists haven't shoved the creators of this anime in a deep pile of gender equality shit yet.\\n\\n\r\nFinally after about 3 quarters of this anime, you can finally see some plot (Not as it anybody in their right mind would care about the plot anyways). Maybe the creators finally realized the shit they were making, and decided to create some character development that makes you feel more sympathetic to the vampire pieces of shits. Ha, as if. I want these fuckers to die a slow and agonizing death the sooner, the better.\\n\\n\r\nSince i don't want to waste anymore time of my life on this piece of shit. Ill only explain one of the shitbrained brothers. Lets just call him crap, since there is no reason for me to even remember their names. If you ever watch this show, you will remember the little shit with the dolls. Apparently crap has a whole fucking dungeon of these dolls, wtf does he do with them? My best guess is that he probably practices his raping skills on these dolls, cause that is just how fucking sadistic he is.\\n\\n\r\nHis fucking teddy bear, that fucking teddy just fucking puts five nights at freddys down the fucking drain. The little shit takes this fucking teddy everywhere to rape innocent women, or spirits of some sort(Couldn't give any shits to find out wtf he was actually doing) Imagine the resolve the fucking teddy has..... To watch his fucking owner fuck everything up without even saying a word. That is a true mastermind, the secret boss of bosses.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending cannot even be explained, its not even a ending. The creators were probably just fucking tired with this shit, and to atone for the deaths of their co-workers during the creation of this anime. They made sure that the ending was extra shit.\\n\\n\r\nArt-4/10\\n\r\nArt was ok for the first few minutes, before the fucking vampire douchebags came. Everything became unbearable after that.\\n\\n\r\nSound-2/10\\n\r\nThe voice of the fucktards made me want to puke. +1 just out of sympathy of the female voice actor for having to work with this shit.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-1/10\\n\r\nCharacter? Could care less about the character development from being too traumatized by how shit they were.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-1/10\\n\r\nCould give negative if i had the choice.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-1/10\\n\r\nNeed I elaborate?\\n\\n\r\nPlz, don't waste ur time on this crap. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "In the beginning it seems to be a lot of fluff, though as you progress through the show the plot reveals itself. The only thing wrong is that the flashbacks need to be explained more, and there are many holes and unless you read it up on the wiki or have played the original game, you'll be left with questions. The plot itself was originally well written and pretty deep, though somehow when made into the actual anime it came out confusing and somewhat hard to follow, especially when the episodes are only 15 minutes long at most, and it is a full plot inneed of full episodes. Some episodes felt rushed, though the ending was extremely satisfying and surprisingly touching considering in the beginning parts of the anime you'd think the anime is shallow, though it proves itself wrong.\\n\\n\r\nThe art itself was beautiful. The characters are my favorite part. They are well rounded, and best of all, realistic. Realism might be the main part that turns others away. The vampires act exactly what you would expect a vampire to act like, sadistic and hungry. Most people come here expecting a knight in shining armor twilight copy and are disappointed. They're vampires, and act like so, not as a fairy tale. Though this is a turn off for people who are expecting fairy tale men. Unlike others I actually liked the female lead. Like others she is also realistic, not some perfect brave strong hero out to save the world. Just an ordinary but still special girl. I don't see that many vampire series out there, so I definitely won't forget this one soon.",

The main female character, Yui, is treated in such an awful way it's actually painful to think about it. She gets molested and told that she's worthless basically every time any of the vampire brothers talks to her. Even more so, not only Yui does absolutely nothing to stand up for herself (which could be explained by saying she didn't want toget killed, fair enough), she starts CARING for the psychopatic brothers. Obviously though, she's not the worst character in this anime, oh no. It's the vampires who basically abuse Yui throughout these 12 episodes who bother me the most. I get the idea of picturing vampires as they are: cold, heartless, not caring about anything and treating humans as food, but it's so sexualized and romanticized that it completely misses the point! Even though they were supposed to be hot and mysterious, something went horribly wrong, because they came out just horny and gross.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening wasn't anything special, I'll just mention it included scenes of Yui getting bitten by everyone (what a shocker). I suppose the judgement of the song should be left to the viewers because it's mostly the matter of one's music taste. \\n\\n\r\nThe art was actually pretty good (maybe except Subaru's eye on his fringe) and I feel upset that it was completely wasted on this piece.\\n\\n\r\n\"Diabolik Lovers\" made me feel uncomfortable and was the most unenjoyable anime I have ever seen. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who wants to have a nice time.\\n\\n",

She makes stupid decisions and makes it even seem she wants to be in these predicaments. She pathetically tries to get away but gives up within the first few second. She is not a strong leading character at all. \\n\\n\r\nLaito, one of the vampire, is a very annoying character. The show would have been slightly less terrible if he wasn't in to.

            "content": "Don't let the first episode fool you - this is not a romance anime. Not at all.\r\nI watched the first episode and I was satisfied: Yui, the main character, looked cute and clueless and the vampires, she was sent to under mysterious circumstances, were shown off as ignorant and frightening beings. I was sure the story would revolve around how the vampires start to like Yui one after one.\r\nBut no. I came to realized that this wouldn't be the standard reverse harem story once Yui was bitten by a vampire. And how the scene was depicted, made sure there could be no atonement for theact in one of the later episodes. So I set my hopes on the other vampires. And I was totally wrong. They are a bunch of masochists that like nothing more than torturing Yui and kept her around only to suck her blood.\\n\r\nSo I kept on watching, hoping there would be at least some plot progress, when there was no character development after all. Maybe Yui would find out why she was send to the vampires. But even that didn't exactly happen. The story picks up so late, the anime is almost over by then. Maybe that is why the ending felt so unsatisfactory. A lot of things were only implied, but never explained. And some things just don't make any sense at all.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I have to say: I read a summary before watching the anime and it sounded a lot more interesting than what actually happens. And that is the whole problem with this series. I think there might be actually material for a story somewhere, but the whole anime was distorted so much that it's barely noticeable anymore. And it was done so for those that get a kick out of seeing how the male characters treat Yui. I didn't.\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound are fair up to good. There's nothing bad to say about the art style if you like it. And I kind of do. It matches the setting and is unique enough to catch your eye at first. Nothing extraordinary though. The soundtrack didn't really attract my attention, but it seldomly does. The opening and ending songs sound decent.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately I didn't enjoy watching this anime very much. It wasn't boring to watch like some other series - the episodes didn't feel like filler, something was happening - but what was happening had very little relevance to anything. And the only thing I'll remember is that the anime has scenes with rape overtones. And maybe that Yui was called \"Bitch-chan\". But only maybe.",

The characters were dull, leaving us to be unsympathetic when needed be. It would only be delivered to us as fan-service for anyone who was interested in the original game, or was interested in randomly placed perverted rapey scenes, leaving everyone else behind in a disappointed mess.\r\nStory: 2/10 \r\nYou would think that since this is a game already, the story would be set up already for the writers to just cut and paste into the animation. Yet, we were leftwith little to no story at all, and once there was a story, it was too late and was very forced.There was no build up, no story to hold onto from beginning to end. They introduced characters at the wrong time, and once the climax came around, it was too painful to watch, so most people would shrug it off because no one had sympathy for any of the characters. It would make more sense to actually play the game rather than see the anime. I felt as if it was made into an animated series for just showing the supposedly \"rapey but romantic\" scenes.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 4/10\\n\r\nIt does seem like once dating sims are made into anime, the quality of the animation goes down by a ton, although I did enjoy the colors that were chosen, it was interesting seeing their eye color and hair color, it was something to look at rather than painfully sit through a show with no plot. I was disappointed that they could've put more effort into the animation, it would've served a little bit better and wouldn't have been much of an eyesore. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nThe music from the dating sim was transferred over to the anime. it was enjoyable music although everything would distract you from even being able to hear the music. There was one soundtrack that would come up repeatedly once in a while through out the episodes. The soundtrack itself is good and it probably serves well within the game, but there are more tracks from the game that could've been used. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2/10\\n\r\nEach character had little to no dynamic traits to them. The vampires were feeling up on Yui, and Yui was the victim. That is basically the whole show. I will give it to them that they at least tried to stick a story in there, but it was too late and it was very forced. A solution was forced at the very end, too. They wanted us to have sympathy for the characters, when there was not even any material early on that we were able to use to have sympathy later on. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10 \\n\r\nThe only things I enjoyed about this series is the music and the art, although the animation wasn't very up to par. The story was too dull, and the characters were very flat. Someone may have a better go at this story if they were to try the games rather than watch the animated version. There may be more potential placed there, even though, I myself haven't played any of the games. I didn't want to be disappointed, and I wanted to be reminded of an anime like Vampire Knight, but at least there was a reason to everything that was happening. This anime introduced a situation, but there was no reason for it happening. It just happened, and I'm sure that he majority shrugged it off because we weren't able to have sympathy for the characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I wanted to enjoy this as much as possible, when I realized that I couldn't. I was confused from beginning to end with useless nonsense that would only be necessary in the game itself. As a dating sim, you don't want to let your fans down. There was potential for this but it went straight down the drain. There's a balance between romance and actual story that can be accomplished, but this was thrown together and completely severed into two different things. They should've focused on the main plot, while once in a while throwing in romance. It would've been better if the main character, Yui, actually developed sympathy for each character first, then once the romantic scenes rolled around, we would've all felt the same emotion. This show got it completely backwards, and I hope that they can figure out those faults and change it around once season 2 comes around.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Let me just state for the record that this is without a doubt THE most misogynistic and abominable thing I've EVER watched standing alongside the likes of Itazura na Kiss. Make no mistake: this show is among the absolute worst that humanity has to offer and yet... it's just SO entertaining! I'm not even going so far as to call it a guilty pleasure because for it to be a guilty pleasure, I'd have to be ashamed of liking it in the first place. I can safely say that I'm *NOT* ashamed to admit that I like this abomination that was churned out from thebowels of Production I.G alongside Abunai Sisters. This programme can definitely be referred to as \"The Room\" of anime.\\n\\n\r\nWhen you get right down to it, Diabolik Lovers is a series which is just so fascinatingly bizarre to the point where I question who in their right minds at Production I.G thought it was a good idea to even make this programme in the first place. Everything about this series is bad. The production values are terrible (which is incredibly disheartening given that Production I.G was behind such visual delectations like the entire Ghost in the Shell franchise), the OST probably consists of tracks recycled from the visual novel which always fail to set the mood properly at any rate, and the story/characters are an affront to all that is good in this world.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is far too misogynistic and reprehensible to ever work as a self-insert fantasy and it takes itself far too seriously to be a reverse-harem comedy along the lines of Ouran HSHC. The 15 minute runtime essentially gives this programme a 6-9 episode length when you condense it all together which is just laughable, especially when you take into account the fact that this is also a visual novel adaptation... did I forget to mention that? Oh, well on top of ALL that shit, it's also a visual novel adaptation. Lovely. Leave it to visual novel adaptations to provide us all with countless hours' worth of wonderfully flawed storytelling.\\n\\n\r\nYui Komori makes Kotoko Aihara look like Albert Einstein and almost every single male character in Diabolik Lovers makes my skin crawl because of their treatment of her. Despite that, I don't take umbrage with them. I take umbrage with Yui because of the fact that she's a walking doormat who just sits there and takes the abuse. Considering the fact that I also happened to grow up under circumstances where I was exposed to quite a bit of domestic abuse, it's no stretch of the imagination to think that seeing shit like this unfold IN ANY MEDIUM is enough to make my blood boil. In fact, if I took this programme seriously like almost everyone else does, I'd find it just as reprehensible if not more disgusting than I find Itazura na Kiss and yet that's not the case whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nWith the circumstances as such, one would have to imagine WHY I like this particular programme so much. Simply put, it's BECAUSE it's so outlandish and bizarre to the point where it almost becomes an obsession. I didn't call this \"The Room\" of anime for no reason. Much like the aforementioned film, it's unlike anything I've ever seen and considering the fact that it does almost nothing right and yet plays everything so sincerely, I can't help but laugh whenever I'm supposed to take it seriously. If that ain't bad enough, Sentai Filmworks is giving this piece of shit a dub and forced great voice actors like Chris Patton, Tiffany Grant, and even Her Highness Luci Christian to get wrapped up into this mess! If that doesn't grab your interest, I don't know what will. All I can say is that I can't WAIT to hear Blake Shepherd say \"bitch-chan\" when he's playing Laito.\\n\\n\r\nThey say that bad drama makes for amazing comedy, and Diabolik Lovers is the shining example of that saying personified. There's a reason why I love watching bad movies like Birdemic, The Room, Battlefield Earth, Showgirls, and so on and so forth and it's because they ALL provide me with countless hours of entertainment through the magic of unintentional humour. I also love it BECAUSE of the fact that this anime is so tasteless and has almost no respect for its characters nor does it have any respect for itself. This is not meant to be a guilty pleasure because truth be told, there's no reason to ever feel guilty for liking this piece of shit. Hell, I'm actually planning on buying the Blu-ray release with the English dub when Sentai decides to push it out because hot DAMN, was this programme entertaining. \\n\\n\r\nIt's one of those programmes that you have to show to someone else JUST to gauge their reactions, and what better way to do that than by gathering around the TV set with your friends and popping it in the Blu-ray player so that you can experience it all from the beginning whilst eating popcorn and hot wings you purchased from Crown Fried Chicken? This show gives you so much snark bait to work with that you NEED to watch it with someone else just so that you can make fun of EVERYTHING that it has to offer. Now with all of that said, I HOPE you understand why I like this show so much and why you should probably give it a shot. Alack, chances are that most people will just downvote this review because I gave it a 10/10 and didn't bother reading what I actually wrote. Oh well, c'est la vie as the old adage goes.\\n\\n\r\nWhilst we're here, let's play a drinking game. Every time Laito says \"bitch-chan,\" take a shot. Every time Yui acts like a complete dumbass, take two shots. Trust me, you'll die of cirrhosis before the episode will ever end. With that, I'm out. Peace. :)",

            "content": "To say anyone was expecting a masterpiece out of Diabolik Lovers would be a big fat lie, and not just because it happens to be a reverse harem (which, granted, is a fair enough reason to lower your expectations). The premise itself gives no room for one to think this will be remotely good: some girl named Yui Komori gets moved into this mansion full of vampires and they're all lusting after her (blood). Of course, something can always surprise you, but this is not at all the case with Diabolik Lovers.\r\nIt's exactly as you're supposed to expect it, if not worse. As a reverseharem, there is no actual sense of romance between the vampires and the protagonist, because these vampire men are all complete monsters who don't even see her as anything other than some sort of blood bank, blow-up doll or something in between. Of course, since they're vampires, it makes sense that they would look down on our human protagonist, but that isn't the problem here.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem is that despite the fact that they're all complete monsters, who physically and emotionally abuse this poor girl we call the protagonist (AKA No-tits, Bitch-chan, and other wonderful nicknames our token bishies give her), we, the audience, are effectively supposed to be gushing over how handsome and sexy these \"love interests\" are. We are supposed to fawn over these vampires sucking the protagonist's blood, or at how they violently handle her, or at their stupid nicknames; we're supposed to find that hot. Some do.\\n\\n\r\nIn essence, the purpose of Diabolik Lovers is fanservice for a female target audience by way of having sadistic men forcing themselves on the protagonist, who more or less serves as the self-insert, stand-in person for us. The blood-sucking is its gimmick, which we are supposed to find a nice bonus because uh, sucking noises are sexy? (Don't ask me, I don't see it) However, just because this is basically fanservice, and that there are people who do in fact enjoy what it has to offer, it doesn't mean that what I mentioned above is moot and not an issue. It doesn't, at all, mean that the anime doesn't suck.\\n\\n\r\nBefore anything, I'll mention that the source material of this is an otome game, which is basically a galge for girls (seeing as you go after your favorite bishie and it's a visual novel): due to its popularity (yes, its POPULARITY; I get as baffled by that as you probably are right now), it got an anime. I'm familiar with said source material and know that it also sucks, and it was made with the gimmick of blood-sucking (and this one dummy mic thingy that I completely forgot the name of and don't care to remember because that feature's damn creepy) in mind. What this means is that no, this is not a satire of anything, and it has no deeper meaning than it lets on: you are indeed supposed to gush over these characters. If you do, that's fine, but it doesn't make it stop being an issue.\\n\\n\r\nWith that in mind, the fact that the monstrosity of these love interests (this word will be loosely used) is something you're supposed to fawn over is a problem because there is no conceivable way that you can infer romance or sexiness from the actions of these vampire guys, and yet the show itself tries to make you feel that way, which is largely inconsistent to common sense. The situation you're seeing is a disturbing, frightening one: you're seeing a girl, a high school girl, being kept in a mansion by a group of vampires and constantly abused by them, whether by unwillingly getting her blood sucked on, or flat out being subjected to forceful or manipulative behavior. This is actually scary stuff that you could portray or see portrayed as a psychological horror without a single problem, but you're expected to at least feel the slightest of emotional attachment to these love interests. At the very least, you aren't supposed to see things that way because these vampire guys are hot vampire guys, even though it shouldn't make a difference. The realism card must be played here because this simply isn't a good set-up: it isn't good to make the people that are supposed to service you into terrible people because, in the end, you'll be more focused on how terrible these people are than thinking about how sexy they are instead. Would you want fanservice from characters you hate? Would you want your blood sucked by someone you find disgusting (in personality)?\\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't. Even then, this isn't the only problem with Diabolik Lovers. No, this is just getting at the core of why it's terrible; why it's unenjoyable and fails from the get-go as a decent anime. Now, you know the set-up: Bitch-chan goes into the mansion; gets abused by terrible, terrible vampires. That's just great, but what's the plot? As in, what's the story afterwards? Does it go anywhere? \\n\\n\r\n... Well, it goes somewhere, but its actual plot is greatly toned down and basically unimportant. What's at the forefront is the blood-sucking, and the plot only really moves forward by the final episodes. It just doesn't matter, because the show itself makes it not matter. Even when you get the tiniest pieces of information, you get a bishie thrown at you for your enjoyment (\"enjoyment\") and the focus is largely there. It gets to shallower levels than its source material by making you get to know even less of its plot than the little it did have. It goes without saying that as a story, it's not stellar; it's basically abysmal.\\n\\n\r\nAs a reverse harem, it isn't particularly fulfilling, in my opinion, by the problem I've raised above: there is no actual romance to it, even though you're kind of supposed to feel attracted to them, and consequentially, there's no reason for me to like or even remotely care about the guys around this protagonist. You may call a bishie saving the protagonist from drowning \"romantic\" but I call it \"the bastard not wanting to lose his blood bank\" instead, because in context to how horrible these guys are to the protagonist, there is no reason for me to romantically think of these vampires. Context is key here, and rightfully so. Most episodes are focused on one of the many vampire guys, but since it's just one episode and the main love interest is completely and utterly obvious, this feels pointless. You really just get a feel for them, they get a feel for Bitch-chan's blood, and then they're gone. It's as shallow as it sounds, and you will in no way find yourself fascinated, liking or empathising with these guys. Sometimes, you get loosely shown some of their backstory, but it's short, tells you nothing about the almost non-existent story, doesn't make the vampires have that much depth (because it's too vague or unexplored for you to really get what's up with them) and does not in any way make these guys redeemable; thus, no purpose is served with them. Besides, as I said, since the main love interest is amazingly obvious, there's no value in the other guys being shown as though they have a chance. \\n\\n\r\nNo guys \"fall in love\" with the protagonist: they either don't care about her at all, or get possessive over her because reasons. It's realistic (kiiinda; not really; more like understandable), but it defeats its purpose right away because of this. After all, this is a reverse harem, where you're supposed to like the characters presented to you. They're also supposed to like the protagonist, which is why it's a reverse harem; they're all after the protagonist. However, these guys are after the protagonist so they can drink her blood or because they're downright creepy and insane, meaning that Diabolik Lovers equally fails at the romantic aspect of a reverse harem, and intentionally, too. By wanting to intentionally have these dudes be far from romantic, but also portraying them in a way that's supposed to make you fawn for them is the anime's attempt at having the cake and eating it too. Needless to say it does not go well. Of course, to me, this anime fails at its fanservice and supposed sexiness because I'm not into dominant, sadistic bastards and much less into them sucking blood left and right. There is no appeal in having unlikable bishies doing supposedly sexy things since it's not like you'll enjoy some guy you consider terrible doing them.\\n\\n\r\nBy the end, the main character just sort of decides to be into the main love interest because she had to end up with someone and you don't feel fulfilled in the slightest. You feel even less fulfilled as you get subjected to the vampire guys randomly talking in a non-scene specifically made for self-insertion before it ends for good. It's overall a shitty experience, as you'd expect.\\n\\n\r\nThe origin of all the problems in Diabolik Lovers is its characters, especially seeing as reverse harems (and harems in general) are largely dependent on the appeal of their love interests. As I've hammered into your head many, many times by now, I find these guys purely unlikable. They aren't particularly interesting characters: the vampires are all brothers, some from different mothers. There's Ayato, your token dominant sadistic arrogant prick whose existence I personally wanted to erase; Kanato, your token cray-cray shota prick who'll either annoy you or creep you out; Laito (freaking Laito of all names), your token flirty douche and annoying creeper whose existence I also wanted to rapidly erase (you're the Bitch-chan, you bitch!); Reiji, your token calm and strict prick whose purpose seemed more about telling the guys off for not abusing the protagonist in a room than to actually be sexy; Shu, your token lazy and unmotivated prick; and Subaru, your token aggressive (literally) prick who somehow happens to be the most decent of the guys... while still being a prick because of his violent personality. They sound simply charming, don't they?\\n\\n\r\nAnd then there's the protagonist, the most unfortunate chick that's graced reverse harems. You don't need to know her name: just copy Ayato's \"Chichinashi\" (No-tits) or Laito's \"Bitch-chan\" and you're fine. After all, she's devoid of personality: you literally know nothing about her other than the fact that she had a dad and said (adoptive) dad made her move into the vampires' place. What you see of a personality in her is how much she's in constant unease and insecurity and yet doesn't act bitter towards the bastards abusing her at all, instead showing worry for them in certain occasions, which is baffling to say the least (or just downright stupid). She tries to escape or resist the vampires, but she never thinks intelligently about it and quickly fails, and even when given a clear opportunity to escape by being able to deal real damage to these OP vampires (they can teleport, are overall strong and resillient and don't have most known vampire weaknesses), Bitch-chan flat out doesn't take it for stupid, clearly forced reasons (since anyone in their right minds would GTFO, no questions asked). She gets bitten and abused so much that you can't help but feel sorry for her and cheer for her when she attempts to escape, even though you know it isn't gonna happen; this shouldn't be a thing with reverse harems. In the end, Bitch-chan is further ruined as a character you could at least sympathise with for her horrible situation alone by acting like she can ever conceivably care about any guy in particular and choosing the main love interest because the writing demands it, and just being a dumb, Stockholm-ridden protagonist in general. \\n\\n\r\nThe side characters that appear in this show are about two, and they're as important as the plot: this means they don't matter at all except for the final episodes, where the plot moves forward because the anime's gotta end on something. With that in mind, there is no need to write about these people. Instead, it's just better to conclude that the characterization in Diabolik Lovers is greatly lacking in all aspects, and is overall as abysmal as the story it has.\\n\\n\r\nThe art, however, is admittedly appealing. The animation is not amazing or astounding, but you can see the physical appeal in these bishies somewhat (if they weren't all crazy jerks). Bitch-chan looks really sparkly (just her eyes, really) and cute, and I have to admit she's my favorite character design despite having just stated that the bishies looked good. The eyes might be a bit strange, depending on the viewer, since they have all sorts of colors. Speaking of eyes, Subaru's eye being seen through his bangs was pretty annoying to see. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is good enough for the anime, if not a bit too good for it, and the tracks fit it nicely. However, I can't say it was particularly great and it didn't stand out for me while I was watching (if anything, I actually think the game's original soundtrack was far better, but that one was just too good for the series in general, though it begrudgingly fits it well). The all-star male cast succeeds at portraying these terrible characters, as expected, but I mostly found myself wishing they weren't using their talent in something as terrible as this. Meanwhile, I especially wished Bitch-chan's voice actress hadn't started her anime voicing career with Diabolik Lovers since she did a good job and had a really nice voice to listen to. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Diabolik Lovers was an unenjoyable experience I found myself not even able to mostly laugh at (with a few exceptions) due to its awful set-up, premise and execution of these elements, its greatly lacking story and equally lacking characterization that made the anime thoroughly unappealing to me. There was no likable character in the midst of this anime, and nothing in particular one can cling to except the character art and perhaps somehow finding the abusive shtick of the characters and their blood-sucking sexy, which I most certainly couldn't. \\n\\n\r\nUnless blood-sucking is totally your thing no matter who it's from, there is no way I can recommend this garbage to anyone. And now that I've re-written this review, surely that can be better conveyed to everyone.",

The art,  well I'm not much into the art thingy, by I do say, those vampires' fashion were too dorky to say the least, that even my hommies would laugh out loud when they see them, also their hairstyle, hummmmm, kinda makes them look like a bunch of dirty old matrons, most notably Kanato and  Reiji who both resembles an 8O year old faggot. Thought them seiyus are good in portraying the characters, it was the opening theme that kinda tick me off, the characters on the other hand, well Yui maybe the only protagonist, she pretty much a stupid one and quite frankly her sweetness isn't enough for me to change my rating for the character category, since most character's do nothing but suck on Yui and sometime they do a some other nasty things.

Do you really feel the need to watch possibly the stupidest MC in the world lose more amounts of blood than biologically possible? Do you really want to sit through such an offense to mankind when you could literally watch, oh, I don't know, paint dry, or ice melt? \r\nDid you take a look at theMAL rating? It's not lying to you. I promise.\\n\\n\r\nBut you, trusty old anime watcher, you're probably thinking, \"Oh wow, the art is really pretty, though!

I've tried to wrack my head for why these characters are so freaking stupid, but nothing comes to mind. Literally one of the guy's nickname for her is \"Bitch-chan.\" \\n\r\nThink about that. Bitch-chan. (There is a 1-hour compilation of it on YouTube.)\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the disgusting bloodsucking noises sounded like people slurping soup.\\n\r\n...And yeah. I think that about sums it up.\\n\\n\r\nSo please, do yourself a favor, and put this on your \"Avoid Like the Plague\" list. \\n\\n\r\nI hope one day I will recover.\\n\r\nAnd if you go ahead and watch this, I hope you will too.",

            "content": "OOOOOh Shucks, this anime was really a drag, quite frankly, I ask myself as to why did I ever bother watching this horrible thing.......I guess it has something to do with the female character, Yui as she was made into this sacrificial lamb by the very institution who should be protecting her and should consider vampires as an abomination, I guess it was my pity for that character were she finds herself in such appalling situation which it involves them Sakamaki siblings, who are in fact a bunch of cool blooded sucking SOB's, so, how do I rate this not so good thing?\r\nHere's how:\r\nStory, art,sound and character: Poor number 3, Oh shucks!\\n\\n\r\nThe story was simply wasn't there, since this anime was based from an otome game, it was pretty obvious that this anime was like playing that game were the one playing it is a really bad one. The art, oh who is the SOB who did the wardrobes of them character? It was a poor combination of classic, gothic and casual, in fact I see them vampires as a bunch of trendsetting losers. The sound, except for Yui, my dislike for the Sakamaki brothers also makes me hate the voice characters who did their role, and, as for the character's, I would have given this part a higher score, but after seeing how cold blooded most of the character's here and Yui's stupidity really makes me give this part the score it deserves.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and overall: Pathetic number 1, Oh shucks!\\n\\n\r\nOk, so at first, I felt pity for the main character, I was kinda hoping that some bloody rivalry will occur amongst the Sakamaki brothers in order to be the sole owner of the girl, also I did hope at first that the church would come to her rescue, but no rescue came just another deep and dark situation that creep into the main character's life. Overall, if studio Zexcs  were playing the otome game, I'm guessing that they really suck, and for a moron (me included) who've watched this horrible thing  from start to finish was probably the studio's way of saying \"SO LONG SUCKERS!!!!!\"",

            "content": "EDIT: REVIEW UPDATED AS I PLAYED THE OTOME GAME IT WAS ADAPTED FROM. And I can say, this anime is a disgrace to the game. The game it was adapted from is a dating game called 'Diabolik Lovers: Haunted Dark Bridal' The game itself is actually pretty good, starts bitter but gets sweeter in the end. But this? This stays bitter.\r\nLet's start by saying one of the only positive things about this anime; It actually portrays vampires as they really are. They won't protect nor love you, but will suck your blood. So if you're expecting a Twilight-like Harem romance, you're completely wrong. This animeisn't even romance. This is a sadistic, rapey and bad anime that you just...can't enjoy at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe story actually starts pretty good. After reading the summary, it already didn't sound like a happy anime. But the truth is, the plot just disappears after the first episode. It's every episode the exact same thing, Yui getting her blood sucked and verbally and mentally abused. Like our classic Reverse-Harem lead, Yui can't say no and always helps the boys. She was literally being every episode tossed from boy to boy. That's all I have to say about that. \\n\r\nEDIT: At least in the Otome game itself, after a while the boy she choose will start respecting and loving her, but still keeping the sadistic and you-belong-to-me tone. Here in this anime they just all stay jerks.\\n\r\nArt is good, colorful but mixed with gothic elements. It portrayed the sadistic tone of the anime very good, animation was also decent (Yup, bite-scenes included) and the guys were bishies.\\n\r\nSound is decent, music was bad chosen but the voice actors did a good job and they fitted the characters.\\n\r\nCharacter is 1. Never given anything so low. The main lead is like a lot of Reverse-Harem leads simply pathetic, she allows the boys to do everything to her and can't say no. She is two dimensional and boring. The boys are pretty much the classic guys you find in otome games, but twist, they're all jerks! They have like real vampires only a desire for blood. But they're still simply pathetic. They do have interesting and sad backstories, but if that was an attempt to make me feel sorry for them, it failed. There is no further development in the characters.\\n\r\nSeriously, you just can't enjoy this unless you like seeing the stuff I said above. It's not a sweet romance story, but a very sadistic story. There is simply no character you will like, they are all meant to be hated.\\n\r\nOverall is 3. If you know what's good for you, avoid this anime. Don't keep watching expecting something interesting will happen, since you will only be disturbed.\\n\\n\r\nEDIT: When will they finally learn you can't make dating games an anime? Yui is in this anime hopeless, while in the game you have the option to sometimes makes her rude or disobey. While in the actual game you can choose between the boys, and while the chosen boy starts sadistic and rude, he starts respecting and loving her. Even in most good endings they end up being a couple or marrying her. Here? Since it's an anime, the boys just stay jerks and never get to know her. This anime gives a completely wrong picture of the actual game.\\n\\n\r\n***Feedback is always welcome :)***",

            "content": "....Honestly I don't think this anime even deserves any points. Unless you're as much of a disgusting pervert as the entire male cast of this anime I suggest you find a better way to occupy your time. \r\nStory: 1/10\r\nVirtually non existent. Unless you count a bunch of frustratingly retarded vampires finding new ways to objectify and equally frustrating main character. It's 80% them drinking her blood and the other 20% screwing around. Their tragic backstories are no excuse to be so incredibly ridiculous and tasteless. \r\nArt: 5/10\r\nIt's passably decent but highly typical shoujo art where if you put someone's face on a three quarter angletheir mouths are suddenly like to times higher up on their chins. Ugh. Really bright colours though. Which would be cool if the rest of it wasn't so mediocre. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10\\n\r\nTo be perfectly honest, I did not pay attention, so a five it is. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 1/10 \\n\r\nUuuuuuuugggggggghhhhhh. Should I even? These characters are so flat and one dimensional I want to kill them all. Pretty much all the boys are the exact same highly perverted character with maybe ONE individual quirk each. They are given backstories to work with, but nothing is ever done to enhance their characters. Their histories just sit there like it somehow justifies them to be endlessly mopey, sadistic and horny. And the main character. F*** I want to kill her so badly myself. There is NOTHING redeeming about her, she just stands there the whole time feeling sorry for the asshats who are objectifying her like complete manwhores. Sh never raises a finger to defend herself. Instead whenever she shows even the SLIGHTEST resolve, she just backs down an friggin apologizes for it. Like, seriously? WTF???? So yeah. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1/10\\n\r\nIf you can't already tell, this anime is a waste of time. Don't bother with it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 1/10\\n\r\nI reiterate. Waste. Of. Time.",

            "content": "Some anime have zombies. Others have witches. This show has a set of perverted sadistic blood-sucking handsome supposed-to-be-vampires. I've said it. This show reminded me of a horrible Twilight fan fiction, written by a masochistic (and also very horny) woman. I can imagine only two kinds of people who would like this show. The first one is a group of men who love to see women suffering and being inferior to men. The second kind is, like I already mentioned, masochistic women. If you're part of any of these cliques, I'm sure you'll love this show. If not, do me (but above all, yourself) afavor and ignore this piece of garbage. Why is this show so hideous? Stay tuned.\\n\\n\r\n~Story~ 1/10\\n\r\nIs there a story? I had difficulty explaining this aspect of the show in this review, but I tried my best. The main character is our ultra-brave heroine Yui Komori. One day, her father sends her as a religious sacrifice to the Sakamaki brothers' mansion. Why? Nobody knows, and no one probably ever will. Great parenting, right? What Yui doesn't know, is that her new fellow \"brothers\" are six vampires. What a shock! But instead of trying to run away, or trying to call the police (or maybe even the vampire version of the ghost busters) to come and capture them, she stays! Because, guess what? She tries to reason with six guys, who could totally vampire-gangbang her any moment, even though it's completely obvious that they are NEVER going to listen to her. She even stays after these guys have sucked her blood. She even goes to some sort of vampire school, which (for some reason) has never been discovered by the commoners, with them. That's basically the story. A chick with no brains who gets vampire-raped multiple times. Fun, right? I'll list some more plotholes. Even though this girl gets her blood sucked out of her multiple times a day, she has NEVER shown any serious severe blood loss symptoms. Even Twilight was more realistic at this aspect! At least they almost let Bella die when Edward Sparkles drank her blood. Just what kind of magical creature, who apparently doesn't need her blood, is she? Oh wait, I almost forgot. A magical creature who apparently doesn't need her blood and can see ghosts as well. Why can she see ghosts, you ask? No good reason, other than the one that she gets to see the sad backstories of the perverted vampires. Why does she get to see the ghost of their mother? Why does that ghost take over Yui's body? Why does the mother's ghost KISS her own son in the body of a random chick? I. Have. No. Idea. I'm completely lost.\\n\r\n[CONCLUSION]\\n\r\nThe \"story\" basically consists of vampire porn scenes. That's all this is. There is no story.\\n\\n\r\n~Art~ 7/10\\n\r\nYes, I know, the art is really pretty. A pretty girl with a harem of good-looking bishounen. A lot of pretty colors. Looks like it's a high quality show. That's exactly why I clicked on this damn trash. And that's exactly how the director (also known as satan) lures you into this anime (also known as hell). DON'T FALL FOR IT. You'll waste 3 hours of your precious time. And for what? Vampire porn. I won't deny that the art is good, because it is, but please. Do you really want to watch a show about vampire rapists sucking a brainless zombie's blood because it has some pretty colors? \\n\r\n[CONCLUSION]\\n\r\nDon't let these pretty colors fool you. This anime is still trash.\\n\\n\r\n~Sound~ 4/10\\n\r\nI guess the sound of this show could have been considered as okay, if it fitted the show. Why does an anime about sadistic vampire rapists have church OSTs? The only thing I can understand is why the opening is called 'MR. SADISTIC NIGHT', except that it should be called 'MR. SADISTIC BLOOD-SUCKING PERVERTED VAMPIRE RAPIST'. The ending is mediocre. I'm not too positive about this aspect of the show, although it's one of the best parts of it.\\n\r\n[CONCLUSION]\\n\r\nThe sound is mediocre, and the OSTs are questionable.\\n\\n\r\n~Characters~ 1/10\\n\r\nHaha, this should be fun. I'll work all the main characters out for you.\\n\r\nStarting off with our main character, Yui Komori. Let me just get this out there: she got absolutely no character development. She started off as a brainless masochist, and guess how she ended up? A brainless masochist. I'm quite open-minded, so when I started watching this, I immediately saw opportunities. I mean, imagine what the directors could have done with her... They could have turned her in a vampire-slaying yandere, or at least have let her escape the mansion and be the starter of a humans vs vampire war. But nope, none of this happened. I should have been the director of this. Actually, on second thought, no, I shouldn't have been. I would have been way too ashamed of myself if I'd came up with this. I'm already ashamed enough that I've watched it.\\n\r\nWell, I don't really have anything else to say about this useless walking corpse.\\n\r\nMoving on to our six perverted vampires.\\n\r\nMeet the eldest Sakamaki brother, Shuu, who is basically living the dream, because during most of the anime, he is asleep. How does he spend his waking hours? By laying down on a couch, or in a bath tub, or sucking Yui's blood while laying down. Interesting character.\\n\r\nThen there's Reiji, the stereotypical smart guy, who loves reading books, drinking tea and sucking Yui's blood while poisoning her with some weird tea. \\n\r\nHere comes my personal favorite: Kanato. Just kidding, I don't have a favorite. And even if I had, it wouldn't be a creepy 12-year old, who looks like he's suffering from the worst insomnia ever and who stabs the living shit out of his potatoes while laughing like a psychopath.\\n\r\nThen there's the most perverted one of them all: Raito. Also known as the guy with the hat. Or as the guy with the most awkward laugh ever. Seriously, when I heard his laugh, I cringed so hard. I didn't know whether I should laugh or cry.\\n\r\nThen the potential savior of the show: Subaru! He approached Yui, telling her she should run away from the mansion. He even gave her a silver knife to stab the vampires. Just when I thought Yui was going to start the vampire massacre by stabbing Subaru first: nope. He sucked her blood. And she let it happen. My minuscule faith in this show was shattered.\\n\r\nAnd finally, the worst one of them all. Ayato. The guy who does not only suck Yui's blood, but also sees her as his possession. And as if that wasn't bad enough, he also came up with a nickname for the main character that is so offensive that I almost threw my computer out of my window.\\n\r\nWell, that's basically your cast. Excluding some psychopathic ghosts who seem important at first, but end up adding nothing to the show at all. Even though it couldn't have been saved anyway.\\n\r\n[CONCLUSION]\\n\r\nOne of the worst female leads ever, and some of the weirdest harems ever. Like I've said a dozen times already: just don't watch this.\\n\\n\r\n~Enjoyment~ 1/10\\n\r\nI don't know how you'll feel when watching this show. You may burst out laughing, you may start crying (whether it be of laughter or of depression). You may feel like throwing up (like I did) or like you want to beat the shit out of basically all characters in the show (like I did). What you WILL think after watching this, is \"why did I spend 3 hours of my life watching this?\". Because that's what this show is. A waste of time. A waste of money. A waste of capacity on websites. But above all, this show is a wrecking ball that will DESTROY your faith in equal rights for men and women. That's what this show did to me. Because I didn't just hate this show. This show even managed to make me feel personally offended as a female. And that doesn't happen often. This show, however, pulled my inner feminist out. Some may see that as an accomplishment, but I see it as something to be very, very ashamed of.\\n\r\n[CONCLUSION]\\n\r\nUgh, I'm so done. Just don't watch it.\\n\\n\r\nWell, congratulations if you've made it all the way through. If you want to see a show about vampire rapists, ghosts, and a useless girl, this is your thing. Have fun. This garbage even managed to get a sequel. Shows like these make me feel very sad about anime productions nowadays. Luckily, there are still a few gems out there, but this show could never be one of them, not in its wildest dreams. Peace.",

            "content": "I just watched this entire thing this morning. I'm not sure what part of me thought this was a good idea. If you're wanting to watch this because you're a otome game player I suggest you stick around and read this review. \r\nIf you like otome games, I assume you've at least heart of animes like Amnesia and Kamigami no Asobi, and perhaps played games like My Candy Love, Eldarya, a fair share of Shall We Date? Games, and an assortment of other games spilled across the internet, gaming systems, and discs alike. If that's what you're looking for, I don't think this is whatyou want. \\n\\n\r\nFirst off, the story: we don't find out the 'overarching' storyline until perhaps late in the sixth or seventh episodes. This storyline is about murder, not romance. Suddenly, after many episodes of just plain rape, the plot turns into something occult-like without any explanation. Short flashbacks are shown, but none of the characters or backstories are developed at all, leaving us wondering if the characters are all just psychopaths. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is decent, I guess. None of the characters are outlandish to look at, and some are pretty attractive. There's enough difference in designs to easily tell them apart. Some of their eyes are gorgeous, too. The outfits are pretty poorly designs and not a lot of the backgrounds were thought out except for the outside shot of the (mansion?) they're staying in. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound wasn't very good. I didn't like either of the opening or closing songs very much, and since I watched the dub, I recognized many of the guys voicing the vampires as some of my favorite guy characters from other animes, so them saying such terrible and rape-like things just made me squirm. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters were terrible. None had development, all the guys were rapists, and Yui was a blank masochist slate that made no sense. Every single time the guys assaulted her, she acted like it had never happened before and tried to even help them. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I didn't enjoy this very much. I only watched it because I'm an otome fan, but sadly, I'm still looking for an anime based on an otome that actually turned out well. I might look into the second season if it has a different plot, but I really doubt it'll be any better.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend this if: you are a masochist, you like the whole helpless heroine trope, you have a biting kink, you don't care about plot, you want one heroine with a whole bunch of guys\\n\\n\r\nI would NOT recommend if: you are triggered by rape, you wanted a plot, you wanted actual romance\\n\\n\r\nHave a great day everyone!",

Do NOT watch this expecting romance because wow, there is not one sliver of romance in this series.\r\nHowever, if you were to go into this - unlike me - viewing it as a horror series, you might be able to handle this better.\r\nNow, how to describe this anime? I'm only halfway in, I don't like vampires, and the only thing that has been happening in this flick is that every.single.male in this show has done nothing but abuse the female lead and drinkher blood. So why am I still watching it? Well, really, the only thing that's bringing me back is an underlying mystery surrounding some shady vamp creeping around the house and the main girl trying to uncover the reason why her idiot of a father sent her to the mansion full of vampires in the first place. A pretty clever trick on the writers' part, because otherwise, there isn't much redeemable about this show. \\n\\n\r\nThe vampires are merciless and cold-blooded (apart from a white-haired one, and even so, I have little faith in him to be any sort of a decent person), who treat the main girl lesser than a bug, and the heroine - I say that hesitantly - hardly puts up a fight at all. I mean, I know they are undead, otherworldly blood suckers, but at least she could put up some sort of fight, or even try to escape once. \\n\\n\r\nLong story short, the art and voice acting is good, but not much else. I know a lot of people are disgusted with this show, and for good reason. You really need super thick  skin to get through it.",

            "content": "When seventeen year old Yui Komori\u2019s father has to go overseas for work, her church convinces her to temporarily move into a large house shared by six teenage boys... Because that\u2019s totally something a church would do... And transfer into the night school that they all attend. What they don\u2019t tell her is that the six boys are all vampires, and like any boys their age, they are only interested in one thing.\r\nThey make no bones about the fact that she now belongs to them, even branding her with the demeaning nickname \u201cBitchu-chan,\u201d which roughly translates to \u201cLittle Bitch.\u201d With no hope of escape, andhungry fangs awaiting her at every turn, will Yui\u2019s new living arrangement turn out to be a sweet dream, or a beautiful nightmare?\\n\\n\r\nBefore I sink my own fangs into the meat of the story, I guess I should talk about the artwork and animation. Thankfully, I really don\u2019t have anything negative to say about it. Diabolik Lovers has a very strong, very consistent sense of visual style, blending the flowery water-color aesthetic that you\u2019d expect from a shoujo series with a dark, gothic edge to a very beautiful result. The backgrounds are rich and highly detailed, with a lot of obvious love and care going into every frame. The character designs are inspired and memorable, if not a little on the rough side. The animation is low budget, but it\u2019s well managed, so it still looks passable.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s a very pretty looking show, but unfortunately, that beauty is only skin deep, and this anime has a wealth of problems below the surface.\\n\\n\r\nTo start, the dialogue may have a few clever moments, but it\u2019s mostly stilted, expositional, and sophomoric. We\u2019re told a lot of things that the characters say \u2018should be obvious,\u2019 but that\u2019s rarely ever the case, as the logic behind it all is spotty at best. The six brothers have unique traits to them, but at the end of the day, they all have one thing in common: They\u2019re all heavily unlikeable douchebags who don\u2019t care about our heroine for any reason other than the bright red juice flowing through her veins. In fact, they\u2019re so voracious about it that the only thing the writers have to do to endear one of them to Yui is to have them stop drinking her out of boredom. Nothing about them ever changes, from first episode to last. Even the flashback episode, which tries very hard to humanize them and explain their adult attitudes, just comes off as hollow for the effort.\\n\\n\r\nBut as badly as our male cast is characterized, they have absolutely nothing on Little Miss Little Bitch. Even though she clearly doesn\u2019t like being feasted on, she is submissive down to her very last drop, rarely ever putting up a fight against them aside from a half-hearted \u2018no, please stop!\u2019 request. She\u2019s not clever, she\u2019s not smart... Painfully so on both counts. No matter how much pain her frail little neck endures, it doesn\u2019t even compare to how sore my throat is from yelling at her to stop making so many stupid decisions. Yes, I know, this anime was adapted from a Visual Novel, and the people doing the adapting thought it would be just fine to leave her as the blank slate she was when they found her. It\u2019s not uncommon for the main character in this type of adaptation to be a self-insert wish-fulfillment character, but who the hell would want to insert themselves into a role that could basically be described as human livestock?\\n\\n\r\nWell, let\u2019s examine that idea for a moment. If you haven\u2019t caught onto this just yet, Diabolik Lovers has developed a reputation for being incredibly rapey. This is a reputation it whole-heartedly deserves, on numerous different levels, from the vampires\u2019 lack of concern with Yui\u2019s emotional status to the genuine affection she develops for them as a result. But I\u2019d like to take it one step further... I don\u2019t think this show is rapey by accident. I think it was intended, in every conceivable way, to be a rape fantasy, with actual rape being replaced with fang-rape. And I can prove it, with one simple observation.\\n\\n\r\nSee, the icing on this cake... Is the fact that the vampire brothers all eat cake! Yes, that\u2019s a bad joke, but I\u2019m not really kidding, either. The vampires are shown eating human food on several occasions, and it\u2019s suggested that they do so on a fairly regular basis. They like the taste, as well. It\u2019s not hard to draw the conclusion that it sustains them just as well as it would sustain any other human, since no information either for or against this idea is ever brought up in story.\\n\\n\r\nWhy is this a problem, you ask? Well, in most vampire stories, the nocturnal ne\u2019er-do-wells need blood for sustenance, which makes their plight all the more sympathetic and understandable. They can survive on substitutes, like the animal blood in Twilight and the synthetic blood in True Blood, but it\u2019s a poor substitute for the real thing. In Diabolik Lovers, however, the brothers don\u2019t actually need Yui\u2019s blood... They can survive on human food, which eliminates the sustenance argument completely. They don\u2019t physically need it, which narrows their desire down to two possible explanations... It\u2019s either a psychological compulsion(addiction), or a sexual desire.\\n\\n\r\nSince they express their desire for her blood right off the bat, and immediately start the process of \u2018domesticating\u2019 her, It\u2019s fair to say this isn\u2019t just an addiction. If that were the case, they\u2019d be actively farming humans to drink from. Which wouldn\u2019t be difficult, because they go to school, and are surrounded by human females on a nightly basis. (At least I assume so... We only see them in school once, and no other human characters are shown.) They want her, specifically, because she\u2019s in their territory, and she belongs to them. Once that sense of male entitlement enters the picture, It doesn\u2019t get any more clear-cut than that. They want her blood not for the nutrition, but for the thrill of it... For the sense of power it gives them over her, as they know in their cold hearts that she wants it just as much as they do, whether she realizes it or not.\\n\\n\r\nIn other words, the thirst for blood in this show is entirely sexual, and never consensual. For that, Diabolik Lovers isn\u2019t just specifically designed to be a rape fantasy... It is hands down the rapiest anime I have ever seen. Oh, and the fact that Yui is basically roofied in episode five doesn\u2019t help, either.\\n\\n\r\nAnd even if you\u2019re able to forgive all the moral problems with this show, you\u2019re still left with a terrible story. For ten straight episodes, we follow this helpless little damsel in faux distress as she gets bounced from vamp to vamp, having her seemingly endless supply of blood drained as inappropriate music plays in the background, ranging from romantic to borderline pornographic, a musical tone that\u2019s not at all helped by the way a lot of these attack are staged and framed. Her wounds then magically heal faster than you can say \u2018Wolverine,\u2019 and she\u2019s on to her next pitiful display of self defense.\\n\\n\r\nEven in the rare moments when she escapes, she never takes advantage of it. She\u2019ll run to a church, instead of to a police station, and even though the crucifix approach failed her in the first episode, she\u2019ll be surprised when church doesn\u2019t work, as they just effortlessly teleport to wherever she is. She doesn't try to ask anybody for help, and at one point even consciously decides to stay for some forced, senseless reason that never actually gets followed up on.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s an actual plot in the last few episodes, but the writers clearly had no interest in it, as it has little impact on the story and gets swept away with little finesse, despite the admittedly impressive set-up that went into it. The episodes are mercifully only fifteen minutes in length, but the pacing is so awful that I didn\u2019t even notice it until episode ten. There\u2019s no development, no logic, no consistency, and seemingly no thought beyond the desires of it\u2019s immature target audience.\\n\\n\r\nAnd here\u2019s the most annoying part... With a sweets-guzzling, stuffed animal-wielding immature character like Kanato floating around, there\u2019s a very distinct possibility that this entire franchise might have been conceived as a terrible Ouran High School Host Club fanfic, with Haruhi replaced by the author\u2019s own blank slate self insert character. Seriously, think about it... The eldest brother is a lazy blonde, who pushes all of his work and responsibilities onto a glasses-clad second in command, and if that doesn\u2019t prove it, nothing will.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is intended specifically as a metaphorical rape fantasy for teenaged girls who can\u2019t decide between 50 Shades of Grey and Twilight, and hey, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for, then look no further, this is the perfect show for you. For fans of dark vampire romances who DON\u2019T want all of their precious bishies to be detestable douchebag rapists, then I highly recommend checking out the first season... And I can\u2019t stress this enough, ONLY the first season... Of Vampire Knight. It\u2019s not a great show, but it\u2019s still leagues better than this piece of garbage.\\n\\n\r\nFor the rest of us, Diabolik Lovers is an uncomfortable and often infuriating experience. There are some things I kind of like about it... It looks great, and I thought having the episode numbers represented by a ticking clock was kind of cool... But overall, It just doesn\u2019t have any qualities that are good enough to justify all of the things that are glaringly wrong with it. For that, I can\u2019t think of any good reason to give it anything higher than a 2/10.",

Well, maybe it does have its fans; but I, however, am not one of those people...\r\n~~~~~\r\nStory: (2/10)\r\nYou can pretty much get the story of this anime from the synopsis. Yui Komori, a girl we know almost NOTHING about, moves into a mansion. As soon as she moves in, she sees that this mansion is home to the six Sakamaki brothers. Yui also sees that they aren't normal, as they are vampires.\r\nPretty much the story of Diabolik Lovers involves Yui finding pointless crap I really couldn't care less about, and getting tossed around likea lifeless doll from one brother to the next. No matter which brother is involved, every situation usually ends with Yui getting the blood sucked right out of her. It may seem interesting at first, but trust me, it gets old pretty quickly. The ending also left me a little confused...\\n\r\n~~~~~\\n\r\nCharacters: (1/10)\\n\r\nThis anime has probably the worst cast of characters I've seen in a long time. Yui has got to be one of the worst female leads I've ever seen. She describes EVERYTHING I hate in a female protagonist: Weak, submissive, Mary-Sueish, and a complete IDIOT. Weren't Yukii Cross (from Vampire Knight) and Bella Swan (from the Twilight book series) bad enough? Every time she was getting herself into a bad situation, I was just screaming at my laptop saying \"Run, you idiot!!\".\\n\\n\r\nThe brothers are just as interesting as Yui is. Despite having different personalities (Ayato's aggressiveness, Shu's laziness, Kanato's yandere-like behavior, Reiji's demanding attitude, Subaru's delinquent demeanor, and Latio's sadism), their want for Yui's blood is the one thing they all have in common. I will give some credit though: They DO look pretty cute.\\n\\n\r\nI know that this show is a Shoujo, so maybe some girls can find something to like about these characters (particularly the brothers). But for me, I found nothing (although I found Kanato extremely creepy at times...).\\n\r\n~~~~~\\n\r\nArt/Animation: (5.5/10)\\n\r\nThe art is nothing special, but it fits the show pretty well. Not much to say here.\\n\r\n~~~~~\\n\r\nMusic: (5/10)\\n\r\nLike what I said about the art, the music is average at best. Nothing amazing, but still fits the show's tone pretty well. The opening and ending are also decent.\\n\r\n~~~~~\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (1.5/10)\\n\r\nIn short, Diabolik Lovers was just painful to watch. Besides screaming at my laptop in frustration, I was just extremely bored with this series. I'm VERY thankful that each episode was only 15 minutes, because if each episode was the usual 20-25 minutes, I would've dropped it around episode 2.\\n\r\n~~~~~\\n\r\nOverall Score: 3.0 out of 10\\n\r\nThis is definitely the worst anime I've seen that came out in 2013. It just made me.... uncomfortable. Maybe if you're fan of Vampire Knight (or vampire shoujo anime in general), or a die-hard fan of the visual novel, I guess I can recommend this. Other than that, I highly recommend staying away from this anime. It'll save you about 3 hours of your life.\\n\\n\r\n*Feedback and Constructive criticism is welcome! Just don't be too nasty about it.*",

Honestly, I think with LOADS of changes and improvements to the storyline, art and characters - Diabolik Lovers COULD have potential.  \r\nIMO, Ithink this anime is most enjoyable when you're watching it with a friend to poke fun at it and spot the mistakes (honestly, I laughed so hard). But that's it. Unless you're into vampires with abusive traits - then be my guest. But would not reccomend to anyone in a serious matter.\\n\\n\r\nP.S: I have loads of questions in this anime. Like where did THAT butler come from in episode 1? Where did he even go? And why didn't the other vampire students in the all Vampire-Night-Time noticed nor smelled Yui if she was the holy-chosen one? Just...?????!!",

After watching this anime for a couple minutes I really thought Diabolik Lovers was in a comedy genre ,an absurd comedy, unfortunately DL was in a vampire/shoujo genre. So if you want some funny things to make you happy I guess you can watch it.\r\nMy friend recommended me this anime but I'm sorry (not sorry),I'm not going to finish it.  I couldn't stand.. This anime isn't a good choice if you wantto watch vampire romance because it's like a vampire parody and I've never seen an anime so much against women before. Overall I don't like the characters,their drawings,story (well actually there is no story lol).Sound effects are terrible too. Ah I should have known when I saw the score and reviews,my fault...",

            "content": "There are good anime, there are bad anime and then there is this.\r\nStory 1/10\r\nThe Story is about a girl, Yui Komori, who moves in to a mansion together with the six Sakamaki brothers, who turn out to be vampires. A fair warning: anyone, who comes here seeking a cute and adorable relationship between the characters, look elsewhere.\r\nThere is basically no plot involved in this anime beside assault and harassement. Yui, the female lead, is constantly tormented by the six brothers, who seek to monopolize her in order to suck her blood. No love or affection. Each episode next to the blood sucking is about oneoft he six brothers either verbally or physically abusing Yui. Minor Spoilor: Towards the last two or so episode there are hints of  a plot but don\u2019t get your hopes up because it is horrible, which ist to be expected since 2 episodes aren\u2019t nearly enough to actually develop a plot. Plot holes everywhere and nothing is ever really thoroughly explained.\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10\\n\r\nNow the art is the only good aspect. It isn\u2019t anything special but it is nice to look at and the character designs were fitting. Especially the outfits of the Sakamaki brothers are well done.\\n\\n\r\nSound 3/10\\n\r\nI guess the Opening is somewhat nice but just like the art nothing special. Beside the constant moaning and sucking there weren\u2019t any memorable sounds either. And since there was no real dialog the voice actors\u2018 talents were wasted, as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 1/10\\n\r\nWell, let me start of with the female lead. She is basically as flat as it gets. No depht, no motivations and no development either. No emotion just a dead doll. From before she was with the brothers to to the very end.\\n\r\nThen there are Shuu, Reiji, Ayato, Kanato, Laito, and Subaru\u2014the family of sadistic vampires. Just like with Yui no development here. They are all arrogant, inconsiderrate jerks, who only differ in the way they dress and talk. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 1/10\\n\r\nThe only enjoyment I felt was when I was finally done with this abomination. I have never watched an anime so bad. No plot to enjoy and no characters to love (unless superficially). To be honest I\u2019d give this anime 0/10 if that was possible. \\n",

            "content": "I'll start by saying;\r\nIf you're into slave girls, or raping girls and making them feel worthless, this anime is for you!\r\n  I'll get straight to the point. It was 4 am, I decided to use Hulu for the first time in ages, suddenly I saw Diabolik Lovers. It seemed cute, so I decided to check it out. After a few days, I was confused, but I was more disgusted.\r\n Diabolik Lovers is an anime about a young girl whose father sends her to live with distant relatives, but those 'distant relatives' are vampires! Seems harmless right? Until the next 11 episodes. It's all justfluff, I'm not even joking. This could literally be hentai if it wanted too. \\n\\n\r\n Considering almost all of the episodes are about 15 minutes long, there isn't much to every episode. So let's get on with the ACTUAL review, shall we?\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory; 1/10\\n\r\nThere's no plot until the last 3 or 4 episodes, and they're very boring. I found myself skipping through it cause literally, nothing was happening. \\n\r\nIt's just a bunch of fluff, and as someone who usually watched anime for the story, I was very, very bored.\\n\\n\r\nArt; 4/10\\n\r\nThe highest score on this list! The art was eh, decent to say the least. I really didn't like the design for the male characters, at all. Their facial shape. All the male characters looked the same just different hair and eye color.\\n\\n\r\nSound; 3/10\\n\r\nThe sound is confusing. The voice acting is very good, to say the least, but it's overtaken by the slurping sounds. *insert epic slurp sound*\\n\r\nWhenever any of the male characters were drinking the girls' blood, all I could hear was slurping, I don't understand how it's this hard to keep your saliva in your mouth, it's revolting.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters; 2/10\\n\r\nI found ALL of these characters to be utterly boring. I often caught myself falling asleep cause none of these characters had well, character.\\n\r\nThey're all disgusting human beings- I mean vampires, I would love to witness them dying a slow, and painful death. But they're vampires! They're not gonna die!\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment; 1/10\\n\r\nThis anime made me gag, literally. I often found myself thinking \"What the fuck am I watching\" as I witnessed Edgy Vampire #2 drinking the girl's blood. I can't even remember any of the characters names, that's how boring (and disgusting) this anime was. I would rather watch the My Little Pony movie 10 times than watch this garbage again.\\n\\n\r\nOverall; 2/10 (I wish I was able to give it a 0) This anime is DREADFUL! I'm going to say this now, do not watch this anime at all. If you do, your brain cells might eat themselves and explode, and I'm not joking, my brain cells are on the brink of death right now.\\n\\n",

Clumsy, weird, violently misogynistic and absolutely nonsensical, this show is truly an abomination for the ages. \r\nI think the thing I love best about Diabolik Lovers is the fact I never know what insane plot or character development it's going to gracelessly shove down my throat next. It seems to start out with the intention of spending an episode on each vampire, but never actually accomplishes anything resembling characterization, and quickly digressesinto an incomprehensible plot soup of family drama, conspiracy, meaningless fantasy dialogue and cookie-cutter villainy. \\n\\n\r\nEven if you were looking for a violent, rapey domination fantasy here - god knows why - the story doesn't land that either. Nothing in Diabolik Lovers is sexy. Any attempt to follow through on its kinky-dating-sim premise ends up comically mean-spirited and awkward - throwing the protagonist into pools, trapping her in graveyards, pushing her over balconies and calling her \"Bitch-chan\" while you do it. I think it's summed up best when a vampire traps our heroine in a bedroom and she cries out, \"Oh, God,\" to which he replies completely seriously, \"There is no God.\" \\n\\n\r\nThere was certainly no God looking after the production of this anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe show gives every character some kind of dumb ombre hair and its eventual Romantic Lead vampire wears pants that are long on one side and capris on the other. Every face looks identical, and sometimes the animation shifts into horrible CGI but only for a few seconds at a time. The sheer number of bizarre visual choices just augments the terrible pacing and dialogue... Frankly, I could pick at Diabolik Lovers for hours, but you really have to see it yourself. \\n\\n\r\nIn summary, it's horrible and stupid and I had a great time. Give this one a watch next time you have a few hours to kill with friends.",

            "content": "It goes without saying while I say I might have enjoyed this anime immensely that is not necessarily due to this anime itself and more the absolute destruction I was unleashing on the poor defenceless 2D series while I sat laughing my lungs out watching. Let me start by giving you my overall opinion of Diabolik Lovers and please keep in mind I only watch anime in dub, but in this case I very much doubt it would matter. Before cutting down why I think this of the show in more depth later on.\r\nIn short, this anime is bad. Bad, bad bad. Like holy hellput this thing down before it can breed. Diabolik Lovers is the worst kind of bad because its so pretty and well animated that at first glance you think its alright, its only until you actually start paying attention that you realize that there is plot or any character development worth your time. Saying that, this anime is very pretty and if the creators might have put a little more thought into the story and characters it could have been a true mast... a decent piece of work... Maybe.\\n\\n\r\nStory: SPOILER WARNING: Though in this case there isn't really anything to spoil since the plot is so thin you could spread it on toast and you'd still be eating dry toast. The story follows Yui Komori a young innocent school girl around 17(virgin) who totally isn't Bella Swan, honest. No really she isn't, because Bella Swan can't show any sort of facial expression other than brooding, but I digress. Yui finds herself at the front door of a fancy mansion in the middle of horror film street 475 with just a bag and her pretty face to keep her company. Upon entering the mansion without invitation the story begins, involving lewd scenes for those ladies looking for some good old honest vampire love and about seven minutes of brooding by the male cast for the rest. Did I mention each episode is only fifteen minutes including the introduction and end credits? Yes apparently this series was considered so hot and steamy that the creators didn't dare make it an extra five minutes longer out of fear of mass murder by girls ovaries exploding. The story is simple enough that I could literally use words, these words in fact and in any order. Vampires, Biting, Brothers, Mystery, Power Struggles, Biting, Vampires. In fact the whole story aspect of the show is summed up in the last episode with a few minor scenes in maybe three other episodes, otherwise its just lets see who can bite ms Yui is the most kinky way. Its best I don\u2019t go into what little story there is and allow you lovely viewers to enjoy its splendour for yourself.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Like before, there is a minor SPOILER WARNING here as well but thats only if you lose your head to even the most minor leak of information, but if thats the case stop reading reviews you lemmon. Now in most cases you would review characters by explaining their backstory and their personality in a short line before moving on to the next while also mentioning their role. But in this case I shall be summing up each character while also informing you how they would decide the best way of courting a female companion, now I must warn I will be using profanity to describe them so please be warned. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSh\u016b Sakamaki) Show absolutely no fucks for the girl. Completely ignore her. But after long break periods when she finally comes crawling after you, notice her for a brief moment long enough to stick yourself inside of her and finish after a few minutes before dumping that bitch again. Then repeat,\\n\\n\r\nReiji Sakamaki) Inform the girl that you are both smarter and better in every way and that she is little more than the trash of trash. Then while adjusting your glasses everything new frame inform she is little more than a guinea pig for experimenting on, that said do whatever you wish with her before throwing her out of your room and returning to work.\\n\\n\r\nSubaru Sakamaki) Tell her to fuck off. She has no place by your side for you are simply too dangerous and wild, a rebel without a cause! Yes you have mommy issues but that sensitive side is buried by your urge to smash random defenceless objects! Be Brash! Be Broody! Then give her a knife and tell her to kill you or your family if they ever try to rape her. \\n\\n\r\nAyato Sakamaki) Treat them like a toy while abusing them in whatever way you please, BUT remind them that they are yours and only yours and if anyone else touches them they suffer from your almost unmatched level of brooding! Also never fix up the buttons on your shirt because you are too busy brooding to waste time with that.. \\n\\n\r\nLaito Sakamaki) Call the girl a bitch, never her name or anything else, just bitch. Then tell her you want to fuck her in a series of very kinky ways. Its important to realize you are one of the few characters who doesn't brood, isn't technically insane and generally seems to enjoy life. This either makes you the weakness or the strongest character, hard to tell. But regardless you hold a mighty power which must be contained.\\n\\n\r\nKanato Sakamaki) Be a creepy bastard. Like holy shit, be as creepy as you fucking can. Stare wide eyed at every moment without blinking all the time while telling her how much you want to see her in pain and crying and how that really turns you on. Then offer to murder her and turn her into a doll so she'll be pretty forever and store her in the basement. This is probably the most sure fired way to get a girl, even if it is against her will. \\n\\n\r\nWhile there are a few other characters their value is little more than filler for the weak attempt of a plot they tried to finish by the end. In short, all you need to know is that teenage girls love this kind of rubbish and if you really want to get with one all you need is a box set of twilight and a few strong bottles of alcohol, but before you do that older men please call 111(911) and inform them that you are indeed a paedophile. \\n\\n\r\nMusic: \\n\r\nLittle can be said about the music to be honest as it does it job, its neither bad nor outstanding and it didn't help distract me from the story so I can\u2019t say its much to listen too. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion: \\n\r\nWatch it, this is not a roller-coaster of exciting plot twists nor intense action, in fact a total of a single punch is thrown in entire series! You have no idea how disappointed I was to realize that there wasn't going to be a single shirtless fist fight amongst the brothers and that is without a doubt the biggest flaw to this anime! Like come on guys! If you really are going to give the plot to a retarded monkey going through puberty you could at least tear off a guys shirt once and awhile and let the ladies have a look that those firm abs and tight bodies... uh sorry, did I mention I totally heterosexual? Yes well, the point is that if you are going to take a mile walk down a road of shards of glass in the hopes of having the perfect pair of bleached bone heels, then you might as well take the shoes off and get the job done quick!\\n",

The characters aren't just copy-pasted with a different hairstyle, and everything is vibrant. The animation is always good, most of the time.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\\n\r\nNo complaints, it sounds nice.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5\\n\\n\r\nOh my god, the characters. \\n\\n\r\nImagine your normal, typical reverse harem characters and just add masochist rapists to every single one of them. That's it, that's the whole male cast. You have:\\n\\n\r\nAyato, who I guess could be considered the \"main guy\", is nothing more than an asshole. Not the worst, but still an asshole.\\n\\n\r\nReiji,  glasses-kun who, at first glance looks like a serious character, until it's revealed he's the biggest f*ucking sadistic creep ever.\\n\\n\r\nKanato, psychotic little sh*t. Seriously, he has more mood swings than actual lines in the anime ( maybe not true, but you get my point.) He's f*cking creepy. Creepy shota. God I hate him so much.\\n\\n\r\nRaito, this fedora wearing little sh*t is nothing more than that. A little sh*t. He teases the main character by calling her \"B*tch-chan\" throughout the whole anime. Makes a good drinking game though. I hate him even more.\\n\\n\r\nSubaru, who I SWEAR to God, is the only decent character in this whole thing.  He's always avoiding everyone, and...punching stuff, but he's actually alright. \\n\\n\r\nAnd Shu. Cold character. You know the drill.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then we have Yui, who's by far the dumbest otome heroine I've ever seen. In pretty much all the bad situations she gets herself into, she has some fault to it. \"Oh, this guy wants to talk, even though he already attempted to rape/suck me dry multiple times? Oh, I guess it wouldn't hur- oh my GOD WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS STOP GOD HELP ME-\"  Every. Time.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2\\n\\n\r\nThis was really hard to watch. God, GOD AWFUL.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2\\n\\n\r\nIn all seriousness, I don't know how any female (or anyone for that matter) would enjoy watching this. This is not only sexist, but also gives a bad rep to these type of games (otome) adaptations.  I personally found it to be very offensive and degrading, mainly because of the near-rape situations. \\n\\n\r\nIf you want to watch this, do so, but don't expect a masterpiece out of this.",

I did finish it though, but I did not like it.\r\nHere's why I even bothered to finish it: I have a thing for sexy sadistic guys and this anime's got six of them. I also have a thing for Stockholm syndrome and the main character's got a lot of that going for her.\r\nHere's why I did not like it: It has no real story. The creator obviously gave it a shot but it failed miserably. Even when youstart to kind of get an idea of what's going on, you still don't really get it completely. All you really know is that there's a severe case of mother complex going around and the main girl is dumb as a rock. Like, REALLY dumb as a rock. I can overlook a girl not being the brightest one in the bunch most of the time but this one's over the top. To give an example without spoiling much; the same thing happens to her multiple times in every episode and every time she asks \"What are you doing?\" like she's sooo chocked and confused about it.\\n\\n\r\nSo, to sum things up! It's not a long anime and the episodes are all really short, so if you (unlike me) don't mind an over the top stupid main character and a complete lack of storyline, but you do (like me) enjoy sadistic guys that's hot as fuck and a girl that's too captivated by them to even try to do anything at all to get away or change her situation in any way (even when given actual chances to do so), then this one might be for you.

Seeing how the Sakamaki brothers treat Komori was really interesting. Season 1 would've made sense even by itself. \r\n[ART]\r\n-----------\r\nThe graphics and the scenery were fantastic, adding that it was very detailed when it came to nature. There wasn't any blurry scenes in the anime.\r\n[SOUND]\r\n-----------\r\nThe voices were overall very good, although, when it went through the cut scene, it was really loud, and even when your volume isn't that high, rip all headphone users. \r\n[CHARACTER]\r\n-----------\r\nAll the characters were well animated. Every Sakamaki brother was unique in theirown way, and they all had their unique styles of clothes and accessories. \\n\\n\r\n[ENJOYMENT]\\n\r\n-----------\\n\r\nI really did enjoy this anime, and I would watch it again if I wanted to, and still enjoy it as much as I did watching it for the first time!\\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL]\\n\r\n-----------\\n\r\nOverall, this anime was very fantastic. I really enjoy shoujo and romance anime, and this anime really suited my liking. \\n\\n\r\nFINAL SCORE: \\n\r\n9/10",

The colour palette complements the dark mysterious tone to the anime but the animation itself is nothing to gaze upon. It's just ok.\r\nSound: This anime does have some nice memorable OSTs.\r\nCharacters: All of them one dimensional, either plain evilor stupid. You'll form zero sense of empathy or understanding for any of them because they are never given the chance to flesh out, due to half of each episode taken up by the men doing sadistic things to the main girl.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: There is nothing enjoyable about this anime. In fact, its rather triggering and has no sense of purpose other than being vile. The game its based on tells the story much better, and if you're into those interactive games, and like reverse harems/ vampires, its worth checking out.",

I can really never understand they way them Japanese illustrate their idea of a delinquent who looks like a bunch of dorks.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I like they way most  the VA's who did the character's voices, but not so with the opening theme and the one who did Kanato's voice, Yuki Kaji where he sounded like this gayish retard.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Ok so here, I have to admit it was my sympathy for Yui that kept me from dropping this anime, one would have wish that some knight in a shinning armor rescues her, however, I also felt a certain annoyance when she didn't tried hard enough to get away from them, even when an opportunity has presented itself. As for the vampire brothers and family members, I also have to admit that they are the character's that I love to hate, where one would probably desire that they meet a gruesome death, but unfortunately that didn't happen and only the uncle got slain.\\n\\n\\n\r\nDreadful 2\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: One has to content with all that sucking and mistreatment of the main female heroine, let's face all that sucking, sucking and sucking proves to be diabolically boring and one would hope that something climatic will happen, so generally speaking studio Zexcs should have left it as an otome game, I guess one might say that playing the game is more exciting than watching this nightmare.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

I think that the story had a lot of potential in terms of the setting, but the execution was just horrible. \r\nOn with the story, I actually liked the idea of having this innocent girl literally walking into a den of abusive vampires, and living with them, but they didn't really do a good job with developing the characters. I know that this series is from an otome game, and it's suppose to advertise the game, but the overall execution wasstill dreadful. \\n\\n\r\nOn with the characters, I think the characters were pretty interesting for a while...but only for a while. After the next few episodes, I just got bored of them. Especially with the heroine, I thought that she had the most potential for developing throughout the story, but she kinda...dedeveloped(?) and got worse - in my opinion. I know that, since this is from an otoge, it's trying to make me self insert into the heroine, but I couldn't do that. Why? It just fails to make the heroine interesting enough for me to self-insert into her. I don't want to be her character at all! \\n\\n\r\nOn with the good stuff, I really like the character designs and the sounds. I think the animation went a bit downhill later on but it was only a bit. But the sounds tho. I need to give props for the voice actors and the people who did the soundtracks. I think that the art and the sounds were the only thing that kept me watching this, also, the hope that the heroine would develop. \\n\\n\r\nMaybe they should've focused on one guy instead of trying to fit everyone's lifestory in to the anime. It was just halfhearted, the anime puts in plot points, and just leaves it there as a plot hole. Well, I hope that the plot holes gets answered in the game. \\n\\n\r\nIN CONCLUSION, if you're just a masochistic person hoping to hear handsome-looking fictional male characters abusing you with their sexy voices, and (if you're planning to self-insert) biting you in literally every episode, then you might enjoy this. Might! Also applies if you're a male, and you have a serious issue with being a sadistic bastard. If you're not that person, then you should stay the hell away from this anime.",

            "content": "If you're looking for a reverse harem, do not watch this series!\r\nDiabolik Lovers is a far cry from the average reverse harem, so far that I have a hard time considering it one. True, there are six hot guys competing for the female lead, except for their sights are set less on winning her heart and more on sucking her blood. There is really no romantic element to speak of until the very end, and even that is rather shallow.\r\n::Story::\r\nThe summary for this series is very misleading (read \"entirely wrong.\") This is not a sweet story of a girl with latent psychic abilities meeting sixlovable vampires, this is a story of a girl being betrayed and forced to live with killers. This ends up being inconsequential, however, and the series doesn't really care about having a story until the last four episodes anyway. Until then, each episode is the standard reverse harem roulette of \"which guy will be featured this week?\" These episodes do very little to engage the viewer besides show some juicy scenes of the boys attacking Yui. These are not for the squeamish as they involve physical abuse and implied rape.  When the actual story-line gets off it's rump and makes an appearance, it's too late. There are only four episodes left to cram all the plot that should have been there from the beginning, so the writers just throw what they can into a giant jumble (with a few more fang-rape scenes) and hope to make it to the end. To their credit, those last two episodes are a doozy!\\n\\n\r\n::Character::\\n\\n\r\nA fair amount of credit is due for the way the characters are written in Diabolik Lovers. While they tend to fit general reverse harem stereotypes, there is something about each of the men that makes them special. I think it's that they're absolutely wretched people. As someone who has become jaded with the genre, I feel that this aspect alone makes this series worth watching. For instance:\\n\\n\r\nReiji, the strict, serious one (he got glasses, don't he?)  Bespectacled and respectable, until you find out that he is a horrible sadist.\\n\\n\r\nAyato, the brash youth who comes off as a jerk but turns out to be.. a jerk.\\n\\n\r\nKanato, the adorable shota who ends up being completely unbalanced. (Yandere, anyone?) \\n\\n\r\nRaito, the playboy who loves to tease, but really has a heart of gold (except  he doesn't.)\\n\\n\r\nShu, the cold, distant one who never becomes warm and cuddly. Ever.\\n\\n\r\nSubaru is really the only character that seems to have any sense of decency, and I believe this is why he is somewhat of an outcast. Despite his hotheaded nature and tendency to punch things, he's an all right guy. Go figure.\\n\\n\r\nYui is pretty much the  blank slate heroine. The only memorable thing about her is her uncanny ability to get herself into bad situations. True, she's locked in a house with six vampires, so there aren't really any good situations to be had, but the girl is constantly asking for it. \"Oh hey, that guy who always talks about beating me seems troubled, I should see if he's okay-- Oh geez, why you bite me??\"\\n\\n\r\nI appreciate that these vampires are REAL vampires. No noble men haunted by their lust for blood here; these guys are pretty cool with being horrible, incorrigible vampires, and I like that.\\n\\n\r\n::Sound::\\n\\n\r\nI thought the performances of the entire cast were fairly good. Hikaru Midorikawa is sexy as ever. Yuki Kaji seemed to have fun as Kanato and I always enjoy hearing him scream. My only beef with the voices was the noises a couple of the characters made while sucking Yui's blood. Ayato's squelching, smacking noises really put me off, and the\"chomp\" sound Subaru made whenever he bit down was hilarious. The music was nothing to speak of, well or ill.\\n\\n\r\n::Art::\\n\\n\r\nFairly reasonable for this sort of series. The dark, faded color palette really suited the subject. I had some issue with character design, mostly in the clothing choices. Each boy wore basically the same school uniform with minor personal touches. Some of these, like Kanato's off one shoulder jacket, suited the character, but others, like Ayato's rolled up pants leg, just looked odd.\\n\\n\r\n::Enjoyment::\\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't really say I enjoyed this series, but I guess I watched it to the end so there must have been something there. If nothing else, it was an interesting experience.\\n\\n\r\n::Overall::\\n\\n\r\nI stress again -- if you are looking for a reverse harem, this is not the series for you. Honestly, unless you are starved for hot anime guys and have a strong stomach for sexually toned violence, this is not the series for you. If that sort of thing floats your boat, go for it. No judgement here. What it comes down to is that this series is really worth little more than a string of pseudo-sexual scenes with inconsequential dialogue and little plot. I can see it's worth as pure pornography, but not as a story. To be fair, as this is based on an otome game, what else would one expect? I think the producers of Diabolik Lovers  are unashamed of what it truly is, and rather than try to fluff it up and make it a reasonable series, they ran with it. I applaud them for that. Somewhere there are women who need violent girl porn who are clapping, too.",

            "content": "Oh boy this anime is a wreck. At the time of myself writing this, this is the second worst anime I've ever seen in my life. This anime is NOT so bad it's good, it's NOT enjoyable, and there are very little things about this anime that aren't a complete failure.\r\nStory: 1/10\r\nThe story is weak and doesn't start until 9 episodes in. 9/12ths of a 12 episode anime where every episode is about 16 minutes is filler. This filler follows the same structure over and over, girl gets fang molested, doesn't fight back, runs off, repeat process a few more times.\r\nArt: 3/10\r\nFor some reason theart is what traps a lot of people into this awful show, and I don't understand it. The anime is filled with awkward still images that are only there because of how low budget the animation is, not to mention constant moments of hiding the characters lips so animation is easier and takes less time, and is filled with continuity errors. Most of these would be excusable if it wasn't the best part of the show.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 2/10\\n\r\nBoring sucking sound with very little variation. Yawn.\\n\\n\r\nSetting: 1/10\\n\r\nI know this isn't even a MAL review category but I felt it was important to mention because of how dull it is. The entire anime, aside from maybe half an episode, take place in a boring generic \"scary\" mansion that's full of dull grays and blacks. Very rarely is a setting so bad that it sticks out more than any of the characters. Speaking of which...\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: -3/10\\n\r\nAt least that's what I'd put if I could put negative numbers. The characters are all either flat (All but one) or terribly written. To avoid spoilers I won't name who that character is that's so badly written, but they're a character who's written to change throughout the story, despite it not making sense at all within the context of the character and show. The main character is especially boring despite having a majority of the screen time.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1/10\\n\r\nI could see this being a 3 or a 4 if you're drunk or high with a group of other people drunk or high, but without that scenery this anime is dull, boring, slow paced, and all around unpleasant to watch. I had to take a lie-down between every episode because I felt myself on the urge of throwing up after each one.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: do I even have to say it?\\n\r\nThis is dreadful, awful, boring, and a complete mess. There was only one scene where I felt the show genuinely pulled off the suspense it tried so hard to pull off (the wax sculpture scene).\\n\\n\r\nI can't tell you not to watch this dreadful waste of time, but I advise you to spend your time doing something less harmful to your brain, like getting a Labotomy.",

            "content": "Oh, boy, where do I even begin\u2026? The fact that this has spanned two seasons so far (also fondly known as half a day I\u2019ll never get back) is honestly appalling. If you enjoy watching female MCs being borderline sexually assaulted, then by all means, this is the show for you. But otherwise, spare your mind and your eyes and don't be fooled by this travesty.\r\nThis is a reverse harem anime, so it comes as no surprise just how often Diabolik Lovers sends the watcher down the sexually-suggestive-with-hints-of-sadism rabbit hole. The very first episode has no qualms about shoving it into your face as soonas the poor girl enters the mansion, and things don\u2019t taper out much in the first season\u2026 or the second season, for that matter. \\n\\n\r\nOf course, in terms of plot, there really isn't one; just one huge convoluted mess of bite scenes\u2014okay, a lot of bite scenes\u2014in which the dialogue during said moments tends to be\u2026 well, uncomfortable to sit through. Also, can we talk about the sound effects? Since when does biting into flesh sound anything like eating an apple? And don\u2019t even get me started on the actual blood sucking. It literally sounds like the voice actors sat in the studio slurping a can of goddamn Progresso over their microphones.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters aren't much better. Yui Komori is the incredibly mundane MC who allows herself to be walked all over by the boys at every turn. I get it, they're vampires, and could probably overpower her. But goodness gracious, couldn't she have tried a little harder? The Sakamaki boys even told her to get out while she could, but no, the twat couldn't even manage to do that.  Sure, the boys may be pretty (and maybe you\u2019re reading this thinking that you\u2019d be fine with it all because they are such eye candy) but good God, are they assholes, and the fact that Yui just\u2026 lets them be like that is beyond irritating. No one likes watching a show where they want to repeatedly slam a metal chair into the main character\u2019s head. Okay, actually, that was rather violent imagery, so just ignore that. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is... not great, not terrible, but decent, I guess. Yui's eyes are weird as hell, but the boys actually aren't terrible looking. At the end of the day, maybe that's the only reason to watch this trainwreck. And the music isn't half bad... the OP is pretty catchy, and the ED music helps set a tone much darker than  the story actually is. \\n\\n\r\n\u2014 Overall Rating: 2/10\\n\r\n\u2014 Pros: Attractive characters (though this does not equal good art); Japanese seiyuus did a proportionately better job than the American ones; that's it, that's all I can think of\\n\r\n\u2014 Cons: Many, many plot holes (the show is basically one big plot hole); art is pretty mediocre; MC has no redeeming qualities; cheesy and over-the-top dub acting; extremely short episode time (though for me it meant less time writhing in mental anguish); forgettable soundtrack.\\n",

I feel like no girl should EVER be degraded in such a way that the protagonist was by the men - or I should say vampires - surrounding her. What made it even worse is that she didn't try hard enough to stop them, and when they weren't harassing them, she went on being friendly to them as if they weren't just shooting the nastiest words they could come up with her way. It was as if she didn't mind at all what they were saying to her, and I'm surprised she didn't just straight up saysomething like, \"Oh yes! Degrade me more!\"\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nNever in my life did I imagine to be watching something so brutal - and I'm not speaking on terms of violence. This anime is definitely geared towards the community's masochists because I simply cannot understand how anyone else would remotely ENJOY it. I came so close to dropping the show all together so many times I lost count. The ONLY thing that made me happy that I watched this short anime all the way through was the little, little, LITTLE character development that I was so thankful for. \u00a0\\n\\n\r\nThe best thing this show could possibly offer was probably the fact that the vampires were extremely attractive and the theme song was really good. I really enjoyed the tune of it. Also, the full version has sequences where the singers are whispering into each of your ears (if you use headphones). Although, given the name is \"Mr. Sadistic Night\" and if I were to look up the translated lyrics, I'd probably come to hate it because I'm almost one hundred percent sure the singers - AKA the voices of Ayato and Shuu - are saying some pretty nasty things. \\n\\n\r\nIf you are like me and don't like when women are constantly being bashed down, spare yourself the pain and go find another show like Fruits Basket or something. If you're a fan of this kind of thing, go right ahead.\u00a0\\n",

VISUAL NOVELS\r\nYoung girl, Yui, is taken into a house full of boys, due to circumstances. Then the obvious they are all going after her, but instead they are all after her blood, since they are sadist vampires. Yay. \r\nIt was very cliche from the start to the end. I could predict how it would end. The character development was so poor, they gave it all away on the first episode? Crazy brother, smart brother, pervert brother,narcissist brother, reserved brother. This is pretty common especially in reverse harem, no fault there. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot was so mediocre. Within time Yui will become something she isnt, and it must be stopped. \\n\\n\\n\r\n In the Manga series and visual novels, they have many scenes where the characters express themselves, have a deep talk, & you can see a connection. You can see how each brother built up to who they are now, what is happening in the present, & many more feelings.  It would of been a 7 or 6 overall for a reverse harem novel in my list! \\n\\n\\n\r\nBUT NO! This was just bad. Yui was constantly bitten by every brother, annoying whining and defenseless persona. Constantly molested and insulted. And overall just had a very rushed plot.\\n\\n\r\nI had hopes, since romance, reverse harems can be enjoyable, but this just not it. Season 2 is coming. I'm curious how that one will start or end. I hope they make it more like the manga or visual novel honestly. \\n\\n",

I'll just read about it on the wiki to see how it ends but I am not watching anymore of this train wreck of an anime!\r\nWhat really bothered me the most was the nickname that Raito guy kept calling her. She doesn't question THAT nickname, but Ayato gives her a nickname based on her bust and she wants to her open her mouth about it? Are you serious?\r\nAnd that guy with the bear, what is his deal? Freaking weird!\r\nReally the story and the episodedid not flow together, out of nowhere she wants to ask the eldest brother a serious question and yet there were never any thoughts of her wanting to know or being interesting in knowing the brothers at all.\\n\\n\r\nHer personalty is just awful! So awful, she would win the award hands down! I mean she will protest, though not strongly or hard enough, about the harassment she is getting, and yet she stays and just goes with them and whatever they want. I just can't watch anymore.

            "content": "There are two reasons why this anime is good.\r\nThen there are two reasons why this anime is bad. \r\nLet\u2019s get the difficult part out of the way: why is this anime good? Its art is good and its good material for masochistic, vampire, reverse harem loving fans.\r\nLet me explain:\r\nAnyone who tells you that the boys are hot in this anime\u2026\u2026\u2026 are not wrong, with the exception of one (yes those who have watched it you know who I\u2019m talking about- the teady bear one). For the large majority I can see why the boy\u2019s designs would appeal to a certain audience. (Personally the more Ilook at it, the less I feel for it, not that there was much to begin with)\\n\r\nA colour scheme that is befitting of the dark \u201clove\u201d that these vampires portray, if nothing else (and yes there is nothing else) then at least it\u2019s a good show to look at.\\n\r\nI\u2019m going to put some quotes on here as to what some fans said about why they enjoyed the show:\\n\r\n>>>\u2018Diabolik lovers is the first anime I've ever watched and I loved it  (oh I feel seriously bad for this girl)\\n\r\nReasons why -\\n\r\nThey are vampires \\n\r\nThere hot  (Grammar -_- just saying!)\\n\r\nThey all have different personalities\\n\r\nThe way they dress \\n\r\nAnd you can fall in love with each one (questionable but ok)\u2019 \\n\r\n>>>>\u2018I like the game and the anime..\\n\r\nMainly because of Shu and Ayato and.. earphone / cool / bad boy type guy. omfg. I forgot my own bae's name.\\n\r\nfaints\u2019 (For every person using the word bae out there>)\\n\r\n>>>\u2018the only reason I watched it was because they\u2019re hot\u2019 (pretty much the only reason to watch it at all)\\n\r\nBeen there, had that mindset, done that, now regretting it XD \\n\\n\r\nMoving along reason no.2! Aside from one or two reverse harem, not one reverse harem comes to mind that I have given a score higher than 6 or 7. Adapted from an otome game you can already tell what\u2019s going to happen.\\n\r\nListing. Lots of it.\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re watching this and enjoying it, then you\u2019re likely a masochist, or a sadist. It\u2019ll easily appeal to those who prefer the darker side of \u201clove\u201d and the different scenarios they come up with in which his (multiple ones of course) fangs and her neck will end up connecting. And yeah\u2026\u2026.um that\u2019s about all I can say.\\n\r\nAnd yes that is love in speech marks. For everyone saying that it\u2019s romantic -_-\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the easy part of the review. Why was it bad? Two reasons-character design and plot. \\n\r\nThe first time I watched this, I gave the show a 5. I like assertive men, just not abusive ones. It was a bad period, and what I hoped would be an anime to cheer me up-sadly did quite the opposite. I was left feeling bored, but also with a niggling feeling that something about this anime wasn't right. \\n\r\nThen I dared to re watch it again after having become acquainted with decent anime, and actually took a few moments to pause and think. The result I re evaluated it to be a 3. The characters are all pervs, pushy, and to be blunt straight up abusive.\\n\r\nNo matter which way you look at it, this isn\u2019t seduction, romance or beguiling or whatever fancy word you want to use to describe it.\\n\r\nThis is a fight over food.\\n\r\nAnd the one who\u2019s food is the female protagonist. \\n\r\nWhilst some of the characters MAY have appealed to me if it wasn\u2019t just that there were so 2D and repetitive. \\n\r\nIn reality-as \u201cdiverse\u201d as these characters may appear to be, they all actually have the same personality with slight tweaks, and I\u2019m going to take a shot at the art as well. The same applies to the art. Initially seemingly different appearances suddenly merge and voila you get the same character.\\n\r\nOK let\u2019s go independent on these characters:\\n\\n\r\nShu-headphones dude, (reference to quotes above) has an appearance for maybe two episodes? Guess what I don\u2019t care. Probably the least douchiest out of the brothers, but then again that\u2019s not really saying much.\\n\\n\r\nReiji-seemingly the only polite one in the brothers and sane one, but you know what they say. The quiet ones are usually the craziest 0.0\\n\\n\r\nAyato- OK seriously what is up with his trousers, why just one? Why not both of them? Seriously shorts or trousers, PICK ONE NOT BOTH. (it doesn\u2019t really irk me but I find it hilarious with this clothes design-is this a new trend? Am I out of the loop and if I am, I DON'T WANT IN) oh and you want mixed signals this guy gives them, and then on top has the irk to be annoyed with her XD Dude is messed up\\n\\n\r\nRaito-winner of the most awkward laugh ever. Oh and his \u201cplayful\u201d nickname for her got boring after the first time he used it *yawns* sad attempt at being a badass, but full marks for being  a huge douche\\n\\n\r\nKanato-get the kid a therapist, or a sedative. Probably the closet to a likeable character \u2018I\u2019ll break you\u2019 that was a good line. However a few episodes along, guess what? The protagonist goes along with him. To a graveyard. Alone. In the dark. I\u2019ll get back to you when my mind has stopped exploding\\n\\n\r\nYui-last one-he gives her a knife to kill him with. Now whether this makes me like him or think he\u2019s insane I\u2019m unsure.\\n\r\nAlso props to the heroine for doing the clever thing and not stabbing that F**** through the heart right there and then -_-\\n\\n\r\nIf you want badass, and a good vampire character? \\n\r\nI suggest a 180 turn for you cause this anime ain\u2019t got them. They\u2019ll give you annoying, uncomfortably trying too hard, pretty boys.\\n\r\nThe words creepy, may factor into this anime, just not the kind of creepy that\u2019s good or appealing. The kind of creepy you whip your rape whistle out for. \\n\\n\r\nExamples of good vampire characters: Alucurd (duh) and Dio from Jojo\u2019s Bizarre Adventures. \\n\r\nAgain refer to the drinking rule games to understand what the majority of this show is about, and the general character designs.\\n\r\nAs for the female protagonist? Weak, spineless, constantly in denial, dumb, can\u2019t assert herself, generic and boring. \\n\r\nI would use more words, but then I might come across as excessive. (I\u2019m not she really is quite irritating)\\n\r\nI doubt even in the fandom you\u2019ll find a fan who\u2019ll say oh her! I actually really liked her.\\n\\n\r\nPlot. There is no plot. IT\u2019S AN OTOME GAME. I won\u2019t deny there have been some good adaptations, although it\u2019s difficult to deny that the overwhelming majority haven\u2019t. \\n\r\nAnd whilst I may not have had high hopes for a particularly intelligent anime, what I was not expecting was an ending so rushed, so blatantly squeezed in, and so confusing that it would have left me with a headache. The problem with the ending? They tried to put plot in when they had already wasted a good 11 episodes having ignored that. So aside from being bored, annoyed, I also had a headache when I finished this. -_- tell my again why I should have enjoyed this anime?\\n\\n\r\nI watch anime with the policy that I should watch all regardless of genre, reviews, art style and synopsis etc. And I always recommend that other anime fans follow the same policy. Even watching the bad ones will allow you to distinguish between what\u2019s good and what\u2019s bad.\\n\r\nNu uh. Not this anime.\\n\r\nI will definitely NOT be watching a second season of this show; at least not without a bottle of coke, or vodka depending on how extreme it is. I am only recommending this anime on the basis that if you\u2019re seriously out of drinking games, (take a shot every time she's called bitch chan, man handled, calls for help, licked or bitten) and you do have anime fan friends around, take a shot at this (pun intened) and see how many episode you can watch before you feel ill. (Even with or without drinking)\\n",

            "content": "Surprisingly, I clocked this anime with hope that it would get better but alas I was fully let down. \r\nThe synopsis cleverly obscures the true colours of this total disaster of an anime which is a girl thrown into a den full of sadistic vampires that all seem to be irrevocably obsessed with her blood. The plot gives off the assumption that it has some sort of romance however it is substituted for the vampires' meaningless attraction to her blood. \r\nThe words \"draining experience\" as quoted from the synopsis have a literal meaning to them. Unless you're okay with hearing ghastly sucking/slurping noises when Yuigets her blood sucked out of her then I highly recommend you mute the sound. Unfortunately, this happens quite frequently throughout the whole anime as she gets her blood drained/sucked about a million times an episode so you might as well watch the full 12 episodes (if you can even make it that far) soundless. The music is not worth mentioning as I can hardly remember it.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were like cardboard - bland and empty. There is hardly a background behind the vampires however I would say Ayato had the most development. One thing they all have in common is the fact that they're rapists and sadistic as hell. The mc (Yui) is the most useless, pitiful and weakest character ever. She succumbs to the group of vampires with the same pathetic and inoperative fight every time she gets approached by one of the boys and seems sincerely surprised when they suck her blood even though it happens all the bloody time. Hence this lead me to the conclusion that Yui is secretly a masochist and enjoys getting her blood sucked out of her (lol what a dumb girl). None of the characters are particularly likeable as they are all quite dreadful and have no interesting attributes. \\n\\n\r\nLike many other people, I was attracted to this anime by its art which I thought was actually quite nice. The vampires' hair had pretty hues and Yui generally looked quite winsome unless she was getting her blood sucked ha ha. However, most of the anime was enclosed in a sense of darkness which reinforced the idea of rape thus the art was a turn off for me in the end as well as everything else. \\n\\n\r\nHence, unless you have an abundance of time to screw around then don't watch this lmao. Although, it isn't quite hard to clock this anime since the eps are 15 minutes, I don't recommend it because your life will never be the same again (tfw when you watch a real crap anime) like how did this even get a second season?\\n\\n\r\nThis was my first review ahh, k bye \\n\\n",

There is no way, I can possibly do it.\r\nWhen it comes to \"reverse harem\" anime, you know before hand that plot won't be the strongest point, as well as the Heroine. You can guess that with 99.9% possibility she'll be submissive...more like devoted masochist, hopefully just  silly, but in reality, plain stupid airhead with pure heart and zero precaution.\r\nSo we have it all here. But what makes this anime worse than others? How should I say it....Although, I said that RHA' plot not it's strongest point...at least it does exist..Here...I doubt.*on the second thought* Ok-ok....Mayyyyybe....it does exist, but(!) because of episodes' duration you can't say it for sure. Only a very skilful writer can fully disclose the story in such short time. Sadly enough, the story itself is, frankly speaking, mediocre and 15 minutes per episode simply killing it.\\n\r\nThis whole thing is a\"live version\"  of otome game. But, trust me, you can play it and get more joy and satisfaction than from watching this anime.\\n\r\nFrom the very beginning male characters are popping out of nowhere(almost literally), declaring their rights on Female and, while giving her mental or physical torture somehow develop THE FEELING. \\n\r\nWhat makes it worse, there is no escape. From one male character to another..from one torture to another...They are all jerks. It's a masochist's paradise! I get it..it's a concept...but it's suffocating.\\n\r\nAll 12 episodes you have to watch the Heroine, being treated like an object, a thing...and what makes it even worse she gladly accepts it. I guess, when it comes to game you can tolerate it to the certain level, cause, in the beginning you choose your \"Prince Charming\" and all you do is dealing with him. But here it's  not one, but 6 at once! \\n\r\n Male characters are stereotypical, we have: vulgar and narcissistic alpha-jerk; perverted playboy; little yandere; lazy and laid-back a.k.a the mysterious one ; cool and strict with glasses; delinquent, probably, tsundere(?). But they are also sadists...and vampires.\\n\r\nWhat's good here? Well, Art is decent...and Music....is not bad either.\\n\r\nIn the end..well, if you've got nothing to do, than you've come to the right place, otherwise....you won't lose anything if you skip this stuff.",

However, I will try to keep this review as open and honest as possible.]\r\nDiabolik Lovers is no doubt one of the most hated anime of the Reverse Harem genre, and it shows. With characters which seem to show little to no regard for the heroine's basic human rights, wants or needs, are unable to differentiate between romance and sexual harassment, and appearpretty much the furthest things possible from decent human beings, what could possibly redeem it in a genre where characters are meant to be lovable? To start, the fact that they are, of course, NOT human, and are in fact vampires of a noble bloodline, with complex backstories that influence their current behaviour, and genuinely no clue of how to treat a human being with care or consideration, something which the anime adaption fell significantly short of delivering.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I don\u2019t want this review to turn into a constant, direct comparison of the source material, but I feel it is necessary to bring it up often when explaining the psychology of Diabolik Lovers, its characters, and its audience.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 3/10\\n\r\nIt is no secret to anyone who watches this that the story is just not there. We initially have very little clue as to why the heroine is suddenly thrust into this dangerous, reverse-harem-typical setting bar \u201cdad told me to do it\u201d, and the show\u2019s later attempts at weaving in subtle hints, or attempting to drop full-on dramatic plot bombs, just aren\u2019t up to standard. It also attempts to follow, yet again, the genre-typical \u2018every boy gets an episode\u2019 structure, which sometimes works in the plot\u2019s favour, and very often doesn't. This case is one of the latter. It\u2019s a true disappointment to see the characters that had their own detailed story-line and iconic moments in the source material reduced to some edgy flashbacks and cringy sexual harassment, played off as normal behaviour as opposed to a psychological assault.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime attempts to amalgamate the main plot (that was originally covered in 6+ character routes) into 3 or 4 episodes at the end. You can see where that\u2019s going. If you like any other aspects, the second season attempts to salvage what we lost in plot satisfaction here, so...there\u2019s that.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 5/10\\n\r\nCharacter art is pretty most of the time, which is no surprise for a bishounen reverse harem. There are a few derpy moments, but you get a laugh out of it. Background work is mostly nice, however animation is inconsistent.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9/10\\n\r\nIn my mind, probably the most redeeming factor. The VA cast is solid, and played their roles almost as fabulously as in the games, Rie Suegara was an excellent addition as Yui (excluding her awkward borderline moans when the character runs). The opening is nice, kind of addictive, and sets the tone pretty perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nBut the OST. My god, the OST. The game had some nice BGM, but I swear Yuki Hayashi is a deity. Every piece of music was gorgeous, and, for the most part, truly set the tone of each scene. The music actually captures the menacing undertone to the anime, and each character, and brings at least one aspect of this show to life in a way that does the source material proud.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 6/10\\n\r\nNow, here is where my being the target audience, and a fan of the games, really comes to light.\\n\\n\r\nI know the characters, and I\u2019m going to be honest, I already loved them before the anime. I knew each of their backstories, how each of them will grow in the future, hell, I even know who\u2019s favourite brother is who and who is the only one that actually likes their father. For me, characters and their relationships is what drives this anime, and I can see that for a newcomer it is a flat mess that will concern and confuse them. No character is given enough \u2018love\u2019 (for lack of a better term), and we don\u2019t get to see who they really are - which honestly upsets me.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, if I come at it from an anime exclusive view - if you are, indeed, the right strand of the target audience, you\u2019ll love them. If you are everyone else in the world population, you will hate them. Simple as. This is a cast of sadistic, manipulative assholes, who have no respect for humanity and appear nothing but shallow. The show attempts to tap into what could make them human, attempts to show their development, and it\u2019s personal how you think they did. (Spoiler, nowhere near what the games achieve). You\u2019ll know whether you can tolerate that or not.\\n\\n\r\nAnd there\u2019s Yui. Some love her, some hate her.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8/10\\n\r\nDespite everything, I enjoyed this trainwreck. It\u2019s my guilty pleasure, and it\u2019s a quick watch, so there\u2019s that. It could actually be pretty damn decent, if you remove the whole IDEA of romance from it, and regard it purely as a psychological mindfuck. It\u2019s a poor, poor adaptation of a good horror otome game (note the tags on Wikipedia), but it\u2019s a good one for laughs. Or a drinking game.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 6/10\\n\r\ntl;dr - It\u2019s okay if you\u2019re the intended target audience, bad if you\u2019re a fan of the game, and horrible if you\u2019re neither. It\u2019s excellent guilty pleasure material, pretty to look at, wonderful to listen to, and it\u2019s already won two seasons and an ova. I guess, give it a shot if you want to see vampires that are seriously inhumane?",

            "content": "I watched this in 3 days straight in the fifteen minutes of downtime before I went to school. Let's just say... my time would probably have been better spent on playing something like candy crush- a time waster game. That's because that's what this was: a time waster. \r\nStory - What story? A young girl gets sent to a mansion full of pretty boys for reasons unknown. That's it, actually. The reasons remain unknown and there's no clear direction for the plot to go in. In fact, the only real 'plot' moments are the little glimpses of the boy's backstories that we are given everyonce in a while- full of abuse and neglect as if it justifies how absolutely shitty they act (which it never does.) I was never gripped by it and the only reason I kept watching was because of the voice actor's amazing performances and the pretty character designs.\\n\\n\r\nArt - This is pretty much the only area that it scores highly in. The characters are, undeniably, very pretty. The animation isn't the best, but it's tolerable, and the set is beautifully drawn. As an artist myself, I respect how much effort has gone into all of the scenery and the amazing details (not to mention the interesting and aesthetically pleasing character designs). However, pouring gold leaf on dead duck doesn't make it into a swan. \\n\\n\r\nSound - I have to say; the voice actors did a really amazing job, given the material that they had to work with. However, the music was forgettable, and I barely remember any moments when I actually even felt tension due to the backing track. Also, I know this has been said a billion times, but biting into human flesh DOES NOT make that kind of noise! It sounded like they were biting into an apple (they probably were, come to think of how they must've recorded it) and god, the SLURPING. Just- slurping and breathing heavily. That's really the  most memorable thing about this. The goddamn slurping noises.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - I've already said quite a bit about this but I can summarise all of the boys with the phrase 'angsty vampire garbage boys'. I'm not going to say that their childhood was all good and rosy, but what they went through absolutely in no way should excuse how abusive they are to the main character! Abuse in this series is grossly romanticised and excused with a traumatic backstory. This anime also seems to forget that trauma doesn't make most people abusive, but all of the boys are still super toxic. As for the main character, she's a little dim and when given the opportunity to run doesn't take it because romance, I guess? Unless she has Stockholm syndrome, that is not normal behaviour (and I don't think she does, considering how much she tries to run when she DOESN'T have the opportunity.)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment -   -_-\\n\\n\r\nOverall - This should give you an idea - I played the game just because I heard that in certain endings the characters I hated would die. I don't even speak Japanese!! \\n\\n\r\nWatch it if you want, but if you're used to 'classier' series, don't expect to enjoy it.",

            "content": "Diabolik Lovers is one of those animes that can really split you down to the middle, depending on the viewer. It's your basic otome game anime with f**ked up plot that'll make your love it or hate it...or just have no idea how the f**k to feel.\r\nStory Rating: 2\r\nAs I mentioned, the story is pitiful. I can't say much but, it tries SO HARD to add drama and conflict when they don't need to. Just show the fangirls what they want, and you're done. But, NOOOOOO! We gotta give a plot device that....didn't make sense in the game either but screw it. Seriously, why doso many otome games need that edge, I don't understand...\\n\\n\r\nArt Rating: 8\\n\r\nEven though the art style and animation is your typical anime look and design, it's still really pretty. It's not oscar worthy by any means but, it's still nicely well done. There are times when the animation can go to mediocre but, THOSE COLORS! I'm a sucker for bright colors and this anime! OH! Beautiful colors! Nice and appealing. \\n\\n\r\nSound Rating: 9\\n\r\nThe music in this anime a lot of the time is nice piano music which, is pretty fitting and relaxing. I could just listen to the OST and be just as satisfied as watching an episode. The Japanese voice actors are great, fit their characters perfectly, which isn't so surprising seeing how they're the same actors from the game except Yui. Also, the opening! Catchy as hell! It'll get stuck in your head, trust me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter Rating: 6\\n\r\nEach character has a pretty good reason why you'd go for their route. You've got the sleepy type, the glasses type, the flirt, the shota, the egotist, and the stoic. Basic traits but, have some messed up backstories, especially for Otome game standards. \\n\r\nYui, being our heroine is pretty basic and you really do feel sorry for her every time these guys hurt her. She's good in my book, though could use some improvements on making her more interesting. She is helpless which I can't call misogyny because it's an otome anime so, I can let that slide.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the boys...(Gonna go in order by age)\\n\r\nAlso, spoiler THEY'RE SADISTIC HURP DERP\\n\\n\r\nShuu is the eldest brother and sleepy type. He's kind of just....there. He rarely gets screen time, except for just showing how 'scary' he is or to shout exposition. He does have very nice eyes, I'll give him that.\\n\\n\r\nReiji is the second eldest and glasses type. That's ALLL his character is, except make his sadist levels go up to f**king TEN! Just like Shuu, he's not given much screen time which is a shame, I kind of like him. He's interesting in a....glasses type way? However, as is, he's okay.\\n\\n\r\nLaito is the third eldest and our flirt. He's also the eldest out of his other three brothers. Oh right, Ayato, Kanato, and Laito are triplets. Forgot to mention that. *SIIIIIGH*.....This is why I can't review otome animes....a guy I like will come along and sucker punch me. I can't help but LOVE Laito. I have no idea what it is about this guy! He's a blunt, perverted, motherf**ker! *snickers*\\n\r\nYet, I love him! I can't really explain it in words. I really can't.\\n\\n\r\nKanato is the fourth eldest and our shota. He's also a bit of a cock. And by a bit...I mean A LOT! Every chance he time he's on screen he's either talking to his stupid teddy, eating sweets, looking creepy, or throwing a temper tantrum. I'm just like duuude....chill! I can't believe he has fangirls. So yeah...don't like the shota.\\n\\n\r\nAyato is the fifth eldest and our egotist. He's got an 'Ore-Sama' complex or something like that and he REVELS in it! I hate to say this but, he's the most.....Edward Cullen out of them. I HATE SAYING THAT BUT, IT'S TRUE! I mean, he's not as bad as the sparkling puss, far from it. It's just the more you watch the more....angsty he gets. AND THERE'S NO REASON FOR IT! Literally, one of the episodes ends with him sitting on a balcony, watching the rain. Are you.....f**king with me. SERIOUSLY! Just write 'I'm tortured' on his back while you're at it! Ayato, I like you but, take a happy pill or something. \\n\\n\r\nSubaru is the youngest and our tsundere. I mean it, he's a total tsun, it's actually kind of funny. He is the nicest (andiusethatloosely) out of the others so, that's good. Gives Yui some f**king breathing space. Sadly, he's given even LESS screen time than Shuu or Reiji. Even though he's the most interesting and the one you'd actually WANT to be with. Shame the anime did that to him, he's probably punching a wall, just thinking about it...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment Rating: 6\\n\r\nI won't lie, I did enjoy watching this anime. Of course, I didn't agree with some of it but, I still liked it in some parts where it's not making me want to kick a wall. Maybe it's my inner submissive. I don't know -shrugs-\\n\\n\r\nOverall Rating: 4\\n\r\nI know WHY this anime exists. There IS a demographic for this kind of sh*t and it's pretty big. Even so, they could have at least TRIED to make something better. Overall, I call this anime decent, at best. There are some good things in it but, it all depends on how much bullsh*t the viewer can take. Personally, I'd give it a watch, just for fun. \\n\\n\r\nOther than that, if you're of age, make this anime into a good drinking game. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, if you do like this anime, may I point to you the games and the manga. They're much more enjoyable if you're into it, trust me.",

            "content": "After reading reviews condemning the characters for \"border-line rape\", my curiosity was piqued. If reverse-harems are designed for female enjoyment (as typical harems are for males), then is this a non-hentai anime catering to FEMALE rape fantasy? (Because we all know plenty of anime for male rape fantasy exists)\r\nA hesitant yes. If this really was meant to please women they went about it the wrong way. The plot is so forced and stupid that the show would have been better without it, as well as any exposition given to explain the situation entirely -- it's so bad, it would have been improved if there wasno explanation at all. A girl just shows up to a house and guys with no background start forcing themselves on her. As soon as they started expounding on that, it was difficult to stomach.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has the subtlety of a teenager's erotic fanfic, and plays exactly like one -- with sexual scenes playing one after another with barely a moment's reflection, and established character forgotten for the sake of... I don't know what exactly (e.g. brothers who hate each other feeding on her at the same time). What is the motivation for their actions? The abuse they received from their mothers? That's the only possibility we're given, and it's only relevant for 4 of the 6 men, but they all act the same way. Why they hate each other is never explored, nor why they live together, why they care about the female character's well-being at all beyond drinking from her. I suppose the only reason they don't completely drain her is that they have to fill 12 episodes. Her being slowly drained at the end of the first episode would've been 10x more erotic than the nonsense we're given (mainly because we would've been spared 12 episodes with these terrible characters).\\n\\n\r\nSome female perverts do not ask for romance, or even context, but we just cannot abide terrible writing. Unless truly desperate, look elsewhere for your rape fantasy fix, my fellow perverts.",

As a woman I was a bit disgusted thinking how teen girls would find this show romantic.... I didn't see the supposed romace and connection with some of the brothers - no! Everybody took advantage of the poor girl. At moments it was too much for me. Yui is very weak and lacks courage - i hate how she doesnt try to escape but stays at the house so she could continue being blood bank for the brothers...\r\nTheart is fine but I don't fancy anime with strange hair colours but this is really personal taste and doesn't matter a lot. \\n\r\nWhat I liked - if you keep distance in your mind from brothers' cruelty - I liked how different they are. Everybody has something specific and they are enjoyable. Kanato was my favourite - creepiest of all. \\n\r\nIt also looked like at the end of the series that they are finally forming some descent story with hidden family secrets so I'll give a try to the second season in april - I really hope the brothers will leave the poor Yui alone and something interesting happens.",

In just 1 episode she gets bitten 3 times (minimum) or more. Please, this anime is no romance, it is all about abusing and it is clearly shown the protagonist is one hell of a masochist. In every stinkin episode she has to trip (seriously, like all of the sudden this rock appears and she just trips over it) and suddenly gets abused by one of thecreepy, insane, sadistic brothers. You can forget about character development because nothing actually happens. The protagonist stays a weakling and the brothers just stay sadistic. Just when you are about to change your mind about one of them, that they might actually be kind, they suddenly go all berserk and suck her blood. My point is... THIS ANIME HAS NO STORY BEHIND IT WHATSOEVER. Have a wonderful day everyone.",

I'd give this a four.\r\nStory: 3/10\r\nThe movement of the plot (wait... what plot?) seems only to be just so that the protagonist is able to spend time with all the handsome vampires who abuse her with their seemingly sadistic ways. More than half way through the episodes, you'll see some real plot inserted but it seems random and only for the purpose of driving off the plot-less accusations. \r\nArt: 8/10\r\nThis seems to be the only redeeming quality of this show. Even after having read a handfulof dreadful reviews telling me to turn away, I continued on because the beautiful art intrigued me. (And I naively thought that the plot couldn't be that bad if the art was so unique and interesting). \\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nThe sound was okay. The OP/ED was okay. The voices were okay. It was all okay. Nothing particularly repulsive and nothing particularly ear-catching.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 2/10\\n\r\nIf the entire story behind it wasn't bad enough to drive you off... the characters surely would. In my opinion, the characters were worse off than the plot.  Not a single person seemed to have respect for themselves or for others, even with the characters that I believe were supposed to be that type of character. The backgrounds of each don't even begin to make up for their behavior and personalities. I'm not exactly sure what they were thinking when this went to the drawing board but this area needs a lot of work. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\r\nWhat can I say? I watched it all.\\n\r\nI wanted more of it by the end of each of the latter episodes. So much so I tried looking into the game after I finished. So I admit I was starting to get intrigued. \\n\r\nHowever, the beginning half of the anime is terrible and plot-less and really only fan-service(?) for those who are into this stuff.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2/10 , 4/10\\n\r\nAs I mentioned, this anime is dreadful and pathetic it lacks quality in almost every aspect. This is not an anime I would ever recommend to someone unless 1) we were arguing about what is the worst anime, or 2) I know they have this sort of fetish. \\n\r\nBut as a personal partial enjoyment and the amazing art, I'd say a 4! It's decent if you can get passed the lack of respect and plot.",

I enjoy some otome anime and their games, but I just couldn't stand the \"heroine\" and those evil boys.\r\nPS: Run - it's trash.\r\nStory:\r\nWas there a story? I've never played the game so everything was pretty much sketchy and confusing in my head. Young silly girl going to an unknown place suggested by a relative, turns out it's full of vampire sadist and she just go for them and enjoy the ride even if she says \"no\" and \"stop\". All the boys want her blood, as if it's dinner time and shejust has no spine at all to grab a weapon and fight back. There is also the mom which is also a weird sadist and some weirdly possesion. Can you see the confusion? It makes no sense.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nIt was decent. It wasn't anything crazy and beautiful because I'm nitpicky when it comes to animation and their artwork. The eyes showing up over the hair is just not my thing at all.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(s):\\n\r\nWe got some light background on the boys and barely anything on the girl. It doesn't explain their sadism or how they see her like their last meal. The \"heroine\" is simply a bride to be (or whatever) and a blood dispenser, that's all I've learned from her. It feels empty and confusing. They are all soo moody and boring and they act like twit all along. Their sob sob stories are not even sad - not a reason enough to have a shitty persona. The girl is naive, cliche and can't grow a spine for her own sake.\\n\\n\r\nOverall + Enjoyment:\\n\r\nIt's not something I recommend. AND I SWEAR THE DUDE THAT SAY B***-CHAN EVERY 5 SECONDS, I CANNOT STAND YOU. This is direspectful and disgusting. I was not expecting to rage for a character, but seriously he's shit and I can't stand his voice (eventually had to mute him). The freak with the teddy bear is the epic of weirdos and he needs to stfu and stop getting pissy over a plush. This is worst than Amnesia and other weird thing I've seen based on otome games. I wish I could beat them up with a rolled newspaper, those trash.\\n\\n\r\nAnother review stating how shitty it is. I still wonder how I made it out alive without stabbing myself with a fork.",

I repeat. DO NOT WATCH IT. If after reading that you still don't believe me Im going to try to explain myself a little bit better...for your sake.\r\nSo first we have this high school girl who apparently hasNO backbone and doesn't know how to stand her ground. Walks into this mansion filled with self-absorbed assholes who are vampires and then proceeds to get \"Blood Rape\" by every. single. one.REALLY. EVERY. SINGLE. ONE. And those \"Blood Rape\" scenes were handle in a very  weird way. Sometimes I questioned whether I was watching a normal anime or some type of vampire blood sucking porn. This girl was a complete masochist, when she had the chance to escape she didn't. \\n\\n\r\nAll the vampire brothers were wrong. I like twisted characters but for some reason i hated these. Basically these characters had a couple of daddy and mommy issues and nothing else, yet they were on the deep end of crazy town. Oh and it seems they took a page out of Edward Cullen because for some reason that was not mention they (vampires) go to HIGHSCHOOL (well only in one episode but they use the uniform all the damn time). \\n\\n\r\nIn the end I don't even KNOW how i finished it...only to find that THERE IS A SECOND PART?\u00bf?\u00bf? WTF??? People actually enjoyed this??? If you want to watch it after reading the bad reviews then go ahead but be warned. There is not a single redeeming quality in this anime.",

The art was pretty and they did a good job with making the vampires sexy looking. That's the only praise I can really give about this anime.\r\nBut the rest I was shocked with. With vampires, I get it, bloodthirsty but why are they so blood thirsty?  They kept abusing the main protagonist and they did borderline kidnap her. One of the vampires been calling the main character \"Bitch-chan\" (I do lowkey love this but I am just sick like that)and others will suck off of her. There was no plot or meaning why they kept sucking her but they just did (??). The writer could've made a simple excuse like \"Vampires get energy when they suck blood so whenever they find a human it's a good opportunity for them\". Still that isn't a good excuse but they go with \"She has nice blood\". Which is a poor excuse. But hey, whatever. Though throughout the whole series they use her as a blood bag. I have no words. \\n\\n\r\nEven the main female character was annoying. I get that we are supposed to feel like we are actually in the show but with this character, I'm sure  no one can even relate to this character. She is actually plain out stupid and clumsy. Even the vampires taking her in called her annoying and they are just using her! \\n\r\nNow giving a spoiler but this has to be said: But one of the vampires even tells her that she should leave the house and that vampire even gave her an opening for her. And what does she do? SHE STAYS! I won't spoil anymore but she stays for her own selfish reason and she rather stay for that reason then save her own goddamn life! She is just... Plain... Stupid. \\n\\n\r\nNothing about this show is romantic. But I mean if you call abusing a female character romantic just for your own thirsty self  romantic then go ahead, you'll enjoy this. \\n",

And after entering the mansion she finds out all the inhabitants are hot vampires who are only interested in her blood and Yui our inept heroine can't escape from them.\r\nWhat interest me in continuing this was the mystery. Such as why in the world did her father send her there in thefirst place? Is he in on it with the vampires? Is she special since her blood smells more delicious then normal? Another intriguing  factor was the sakamaki brothers(vampires) who at episode 1 gave an atmosphere of horror and thrill that I deeply enjoyed...but man that was short-lived. I was expecting a much more bigger twist but the twist they pulled here was \"meh\". In the end it had a lot of plot-holes.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the characters, two words: masochist and sadist. It easily describes our heroine and her vampire harem. Other than that vampire bros appear flat and are archetypes for boys you want to date. Another thing if these boys are vampires with power why in the world do they need to go to school for and why did they showcase a school when really the school never went with the plot. Don't get me started on Yui, she has no guts whatsoever and her only redeeming quality is her kind ignorance.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation was so-so but I was more impress with the music. I really love the opening and ending song which match the the haunting theme which the anime lacks.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I was entertained only to a limited extent. Even for a otome game based anime it was bad and yes i watch other otome animes and know which is good. I would not recommend this but hey if your only into watching your bishies getting it on then go ahead but be warn the plot gave me a few dead brain cells.\\n",

I gave the story a 4 because there are some intriguing factors, but it feels like there just gonna beat up on the main.\r\nArt: 7\r\nThisis always a high factor for many shows, the characters are unique and designed well. Although so far, the setting is normally in the house or school.. Since there are only two locations; the Art feels recycled, thus why I give it a rating of 7.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I can't say I'm fond of the OP or ED; but they fit the show well. I gave it a 6 here because most of the sound design fits the show, but really isn't memorable.. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\\n\r\nEven though the development of the characters is quite low, they are pretty quick to establish the characters personalities, Mannerisms, etc. They all just seem mean in general, but with some of the development that is there you see that some of the brothers if not just one, weren't always that way.. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, I haven't really enjoyed watching this whatsoever. I'm not to keen on abusing or using women, so watching this kinda doesn't go down well.. I don't even know if I will finish the series.. gave it a 3 here ..\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5\\n\\n\r\nConsidering above, this teeters between a 5-6 overall.. I went with the 5 because the numbers were closer.. Personally, I wouldn't recommend this show at all, but a lot could change from episode 6 to 12.. If your chill with abusive scenes, I say give it a go.. I don't know yet if I'll keep watching, just felt it needed a fair review.",

            "content": "Diabolik Lovers is an anime about one girl and six hoot vampire guys. Through the 12 episode season, where each episode is 15 minutes long, it's easy to find problems with the anime. But that being said, I don't think it was a total waste.\r\nStory: 2/10\r\nThe story, despirte it's obvious cheesiness and predictable events, had a lot of plot holes. All these left me with questions even after I finished the anime, such as:\r\n\u263b How come whenever Yui is about to get her blood sucked she turns her head so HER NECK is facing the vampire?\r\n\u263b What happened to everyone else's mothers?\r\n\u263b Where is theboy's fathers?\\n\r\n\u263b Why did they stop going to school after the first episode?\\n\r\n\u263b Why is Yui's blood even THAT good?\\n\r\nAnd many more!\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nI did enjoy the art. I really did. The character design was amazing, especially since not every character looked the same. The backgrounds (especially the night ones) were quite enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10\\n\r\nThe opening was great, I did think it really fit the whole theme with vampires and mwhahaha evil stuff like that. I always skipped the ending though, it was pretty boring.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 2/10\\n\r\nFirst, can we just talk about Yui. Like, why hasn't she taken up self defense yet? You would think that being there for over a month (since there were two full moons wow look I'm decently smart) she would've done at least SOMETHING. I know that she can't beat everyone up but come on, she's practically like everyone's play toy that they just can't get enough of. Oh and also, did I mention that she is EXTREMELY naive?\\n\\n\r\nJust in case you were wondering, I have evidence (woah look applying knowledge from school) for this.\\n\r\nYou see, Yui actually gets bitten so many times, I started making a list of some of the different places where it happens, and here are just some:\\n\r\n\u263b A bathtub\\n\r\n\u263b A cemetery \\n\r\n\u263b A church\\n\r\n\u263b Yui's bedroom\\n\r\n\u263b Underwater (in a pool)\\n\r\nAnd lots lots more ^-^\\n\\n\r\nThe other guys are okay. They all have a past which makes their morals somewhat there. However, they really don't go through any change. They end the way they started, even after all Yui's efforts to change them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nNow I know I'm kind of contradicting myself here, but for some reason I did enjoy this series. Maybe it was because I was laughing at how cheesy it was. Maybe it was because I wanted to see if Yui ended up dying in the end. Maybe it was because I ship Yui x Ayato (a lot).\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\r\nWell, this anime sure was something. Not in a good way, but not in a bad either. And maybe it's just me but I'm planning on watching the second season.",

Most of the episodes revolved around the girl willingly walking into danger, getting the danger she deserved, then begging for it to stop. \r\nThe protagonist has no personality. The antagonist has no personality. The hot boys are overused cliches. The senseless plot is an overused cliche with no personality. \r\nYou will enjoy this show if:\r\n1.

It's like a Theatre of the Absurd -- it has no plot, no point, nada nada nada. The story's literally about a helpless girl who falls prey to a bunch of ridiculously handsome vampires. The end. \\n\\n\r\nThe art (8/10):\\n\r\nThe artwork's just about the only good thing about this anime. But does that somehow outweigh the other horrible qualities of the anime? Don't even dream about it. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters (1/10): \\n\r\nThe protagonist has no personality, no voice, no strength, nothing. I was hoping that she would stand up for herself, but she's outrageously quiet and boring. As for the male characters, I can't seem to distinguish them. Why are there so damn many of them? Okay, fine, some of them are distinguishable. But why have a gazillion brothers that aren't THAT different? \\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment (3/10):\\n\r\nI wish I could show you what my face looked like the entire time. It looked like I was smelling Satan's farts. The only words that were going through my head as I was watching the anime were: W. T.

And honestly, each time the vampires laughed at her for how pathetic she was I almost started to believe them. Little Bitch is an empty shell of a character who exists at the whim of a bunch of vampires and the show is a plotless train wreck that exists at the whim of a seriously unsophisticated fanbase.",

I was wrong.\r\n~No enjoyment whatsoever. I'd have tobe paid to watch this anime again.\\n\r\n~There was barely a story line and what of it only came around towards the end of the anime- In which I had already wasted my time in watching.

It did sound sort of... vampiric.\\n\r\n~The characters were awful. If you're into S&M (Sadism/Masochism) than you'll probably like the way they all treated each other and reacted. Yui was a girl with no backbone and not a single intelligent thought in her brain and the brothers were all terrible to her. They didn't like her to any extent as you would expect from a supposed romance anime. They lusted after her and her blood but in such a way where it wasn't even attractive. Just.. creepy. \\n",

I'm a sucker for anything vampire, and I'll watch pretty much anything tagged vampire even if people think it's the worst. This show is a perfect example as to why a lot of people think vampire based shows and movies suck (heh). Secondly, it's known as being reverse harem and I have a soft spot in my heart for reverse harems. \r\nWhat I actually got was a misogynistic cycle of abuse that honestly made me feel sick. The truth of thematter is that this show is meant for girls. It has at least a decent enough following to be fairly high up on the list for popularity, and it was meant to appeal to women. I genuinely feel sorry and concerned due to that. \\n\\n\r\nIf you want to watch 12 episodes of dull characters abusing a young girl, including non consensual sexual implications, with the cover of a story line that is weak and makes little to no sense, this is the show for you.",

This anime is extremely boring with no humour, plot theme and is plain absurd.\r\nThe characters lack originality, they are stupid most of the time. The main character, Yui is the main problem here. i'll explain to you what I mean.\r\nStory: 1/10\r\nThe story could have developed more, and had the potential to well.... become average. But the plot is ignored, and for most of the show, actually in every episode the main character get bitten by vampires. She gets sexually harassed and doesn't run away when offered the chance to.\r\nIf youare masochists then I will recommend this abomination to you. Since the whole show has extremely dark (more like sexual themes and abuse) themes. It comes to the point where I wonder what I'm watching. That's a day of my life i'll never get back.\\n\\n\r\nFor most of the show, you keep wondering when the story will get deeper or more interesting. I'll be surprised id you sit down and watch all the episodes patiently.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4/10\\n\r\nNot much to say, but I guess it was alright. Yui's voice was high pitched and squeaky. The Sakamaki brothers had mature, deep voices.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nNot gonna le, as much as I hated the show, the only reason I watched it was B/C of the art. It was pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 1/10\\n\r\nThe characters suck. I want them all to go die and never return to the surface of the anime world again.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment; 1/10\\n\r\nI hated it. I don't even know why I even watched the hole of it. No humour, lots of drama and everyone going loko for yui's blood.\\n\\n\r\nOverall; 2/10\\n\r\nBecause of the art, I'm giving it a 2 other than the art. this show is a piece of trash.",

All I understood was a young girl moves into a house with tons of hot vampire boys. And that's mostly it. I forget the ending because I was to busy cringing at the horrible characters. \r\nSPEAKING OF CHARACTERS. Lets' talk about them. \r\nThe main female lead is as interesting as an uncooked plain bagel. She's nothing but a total idiot who doesn't know that her life is practically in danger, and she doesn't want toleave her situation because...actually, I DONT KNOW WHY! There's a scene where she has a perfect way out and she doesn't even take that chance! She just sits in her room and cries and mopes. \\n\\n\r\nAll of the boys are awful too. Not only are they abusive scumbags, but they're boring. Nothing but stereotypes. One is stoic and Kyoya Ootori like (Ouran High School Host Club), one is into sweet things and holds a stuffed bear, one is kind of secluded and quiet, one is hot headed and so on and so forth. Their backstories about their bad parents didn't help me sympathize with them either. \\n\\n\r\nI understand the point of a harem/ a reverse harem is so that the main character is kind of a Lego piece. You can put yourself in their place and be the object of many boys affection. But not only would NO woman want to be in this situation ever, there is just no point. Non of the characters are worth anyone's affection, unless you like that abusive type of guy. \\n\\n\r\nLiterally the only good part of this anime is the opening theme song. I like it and I think it's catchy. And it did hype me for episode 1 so I thought that everyone was just being to emotional. But nope. Its a bad show\\n\\n\r\nGod this anime is just bad. I know there is a second season but I did not and will not watch it.",

You should come to this anime just wanting to waste a few hours watching pretty vampires sucking a submissive girl's blood.  In a sense, it may satisfy a little fetish you have, because the blood sucking scenes happen to be quite hot...\r\nStory: 4/10 \r\nThere are many obvious holes in the plot, but the plot is rather simple, and is something you should not think much of, but rather, just go along with it. A high school girl moves to a mansion full of smexy sadistic vampires whoall love to suck her blood and screw with her. Simple enough, right?\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is actuallly very unique, especially the eyes. The dark toned artwork is very fitting for this anime. I would not watch this if not for the nice artwork...\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nNothing special, though the opening is very catchy :D. The music is just a nice little touch in the background to complement the scenes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nEach character is interesting and unique in their own way, but each being very sadistic.

You'll probably enjoy the blood sucking scenes. I do not understand the other reviews saying this anime is disgusting, all that happens is blood sucking and sparkles.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nA short anime to waste your time on. Definetely not romance, but rather a show you should come to watch for the pretty characters and sexy scenes :p.  It is not revolting as the other reviews say they are.",

If you look closely, one can observe the steam coming off of this ugly turd.\r\nYes, this anime is bad. That's an understatement; it's horribly atrocious and deserves to be killed with fire.\r\nHere's what you'll get when you watch this anime: A bunch of \"kawaii\" guys who are actually sadistic, disgusting pedophiles that want nothing more than to ravage and rape this pigeon-brain of a woman. Oh and don't forget they treat her like absolute garbage. \r\nAnd what's more, people likethis crap. They fantasize about being taken advantage of and treated worse than the amoebas your chemistry teacher burns to death with his hydrochloric acid.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is decent and the girl is the only redeeming factor is you look past how stupid she is. This is what she does: \"No, stop Ayato-kun\" and that's all the fight she puts up. She doesn't slap them, she doesn't stab them, she doesn't pop a cap in their ass, she just lets it happen.\\n\\n\r\nIt gets to the point where you're watching the same thing every episode: our MC getting molested by pedophiles. Not very enjoyable unless you're into that kind of disgusting thing.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot of this show is non-existent. Out of the 10 minutes of seeing this girl treated like she's cattle, you'll occasionally see her go, \"Ow. My heart.\" And the \"story\" only comes into play in the last 3 episodes. It's no story. My dog could write a better story about how he chases his tail and likes to scratch his butt on the wall, and that would be far more entertaining and fulfilling of a story than this one.\\n\\n\r\nDon't watch this show unless you just have to add it to your list of anime under your belt. It's not fun, it's not enjoyable, and it's not worth your time.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading. I hope this review saves you from 12 episodes of banging your head on your desk and singing Jesus loves me songs.",

            "content": "To say that I had difficulty going through this show would be lying, though I remember ranting and venting about it a lot when it was airing. Before starting it, I already had a very bad impression of it because I had the feeling it tried to promote some sort of \u201cwoman abuse\u201d without going onto the hentai fetish path. I didn\u2019t understand why some girls would like their boyfriends to abuse them and still accept them after all. It\u2019s a very touchy issue, mostly because most victims of abuse tend to \u201cminimize\u201d their situation because they hope for some sort of change for thebetter, somehow similar to the heroine, I guess, just that you can add a spark of Stockholme Syndrome to Yui too. Yet, let\u2019s keep in mind that Diabolik Lovers is originally an otome game and seriously, the BDSM fetish exists and some girls do have the rape/abuse fantasies, however, WARNING, I do not justify rape and abuse under any means! Play is something, reality is something else entirely! lol And knowing that, I tried to take it seriously and try to understand why the characters act the way they do, while keeping my mind open and that\u2019s why I can say that I did somehow enjoy it after all.\\n\\n\r\nKeeping in mind that I did not play the Diabolik Lovers otome game, the story, the way it\u2019s portrayed by the anime, is kind of\u2026sketchy, to use a diplomatic term. Maybe because of the lenght or for some other reason, I had an issue with the fast \u201caffection\u201d the vampires started to feel for Yui, or the interest, or whatever you want to call it: the overall development of the story, as well as Yui\u2019s overall behaviour and ambigous execution of the plot. Yui didn\u2019t react as a normal person should and would from episode 1 right after Ayato pushed her down the first time and it was seriously frustrating for me to watch her or try to relate to her situation/understand why she would come to love or even \u201clike\u201d the vampires. While in terms of \u201cabuse\u201d it wasn\u2019t as much as I initially expected and I did develop soft spots for some of the guys, I still can\u2019t understand why somebody would adapt so fast to getting bitten 24/7, sexually harassed, verbally harassed, mentally traumatized, poisoned (I\u2019m not even kidding you!) and then be like \u201cawwww come here sexy, pitiful vampires!\u201d. It does not work like that. I would have attempted to commit suicide at least 5 times during the progression of the show. No matter how sexy the guys I live with are\u2026Unless I am such an M that i would secretly enjoy the abuse\u2026and HOLY SHIZ THAT MAKES SENSE!\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n.\\n\\n\r\nI still fail to understand Yui. She wasn\u2019t as bad as Amnesia\u2018s unnamed heroine, but she wasn\u2019t far at all, and for no reason at all either. This only accentuated her \u201cdull doll\u201d image whose only purpose was to get chased and pushed back and forth between the different vampires because apparently a heroine with personality would just take the spotlight from the poor poor pitiful vampires\u2026.or would just get killed faster. PLEASE.\\n\r\nExcepting the heroine, the vampire protagonists have quite a bit of backstory that might explain their messed up behaviours and lack of common sense or morales. Of course, it managed to \u201cexplain\u201d it, but not \u201cjustify\u201d it; I refuse to justify \u201cabusers\u201d. The most fleshed out in my opinion was Ayato. He\u2019s also one of my personal favorites exactly because I could figure him out to a bigger extent than the others and he wasn\u2019t technically THAT bad (no, still not justfying or minimizing it, but compared to others, Ayato, Shuu and Subaru might be the most \u201cinnocent\u201d).\\n\\n\r\nSwitching to some good aspects that I did not consider before, though, the portrayal of vampires Diabolik Lovers has is\u2026not original, but fresh. It goes out of the Twilight-trend or the Vampire Knight-trend; I\u2019m not sure when it started. Whatever fiction has been saying for the last 10 years or so, vampires are not supposed to be Prince Charming and vampires.do.not.sparkle (I\u2019m sorry, I couldn\u2019t resist XD) and vampires do not have weird-shit powers like spitting fire and growing weeds. Technically, vampires are not supposed to be handsome either, but it makes way more sense than everything above so I can forgive that. I wished Diabolik Lovers vampires wouldn\u2019t hide their messed up personalities behind the justification of \u201cabuse\u201d, but I guess that makes it quite ironical, thinking how some of them tend to abuse the heroine in a similar way as they were abused in childhood, without spoiling that too much.\\n\\n\r\nThe design of the characters is gorgeous. Even Yui is quite pretty and not bland looking at all, whatever the guys say, so goodjob Rejet. Though the animation is nothing to praise and is overall too static like ZEXCS always likes to do, the bleak looking colors do a good job in toning the general atmosphere. In a mix with the amazing OST which is seriously the strongest part of Diabolik Lovers together with the voice acting, it\u2019s just a pleasure for the eyes and ears. The OST reminds me a lot of a modernized version of the old-fashioned pipe organ music used for those classical horror movies and it seriously gives me lots of feels.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I don\u2019t think that Diabolik Lovers anime has a good story. It\u2019s something that attempts to be dark for the sake of being \u201cdark\u201d and not the other way around. I don\u2019t have a big issue with the ideas as much as I had with the execution of them; of course this is my own humble opinion. I know there are those people out there that praise Diabolik Lovers as some kind of masterpiece, but to me it\u2019s all because of the 50 Shades of Gray-ish trend going around from 2012-2013 to today. And because I made this parallel before and lots of people seems to like to bash on it, YES! I find Amnesia a better story than Diabolik Lovers and I have no issue admitting it! Now I can\u2019t wait to see what will they put Yui through in the sequel\u2026.",

            "content": "This is possibly the worst anime that I have ever watched. I'm not even sure it deserves a two, but here it goes.\r\nThe plot and characters have little to no development. The plot is actually pretty stereotypical and run-of-the-mill, and as it is, does not completely offend me. The art too is probably one of the redeeming qualities about the anime. It is well-rendered, and I certainly have no complaints about the male characters in terms of looks. However, this is where this review is going to take a downturn so be prepared. Let me just start off by saying borderline and implied rape, molestation,and anti-feminism. Okay, so while most shoujo animes and mangas aren't exactly very pro-feminism, this anime takes the cake in regards to anti-feminism. Each episode is progressively even worse than the last episode.\\n\\n\r\nIn spite of all this, I kept watching, and I regret doing so. I hoped, practically prayed, the female protagonist would fight it, but instead, she only strikes out every episode after episode. The problem is, the protagonist lets all the of aforementioned happen to her. Other than crying out words like \"no,\" she doesn't even try to escape. Just at least give me a knee to the groin, for goodness sake, anything would have done honestly.\\n\\n\r\nKudos to her for trying to run away, but completely failing. Even so, I didn't find this to be redeeming enough to save the anime. It still remains on my worst anime ever list, and I will happily try to never think about this anime again after writing this review.",

I admit I don't like most things done with vampires, not because of Twilight, but because half of it is unoriginal. However I'm just happy this keeps to some type of formula that we expect coming from more...'traditional' vampire.\r\nDon't go into this wanting love and romance. Don't go into this thinking the heroine won't get abused. And for the love of God don't go into this thinking it'll have a happy ending. This series is dark, the heroine get's flung around, and she isnot getting a way out. \\n\\n\r\nNow I'm sure this has your blood pumped, but due keep in mind this is geared for fangirls. So no you don't get impressive action scenes and strange torture scenes, but you do get superb music and gorgeous art. The Japanese voice acting is perfect while the English is solid. Of course that's depends on if you're dying to hate English dubs...The characters are mostly tropes, but for what it's worth this is based off an otome game, what did you expect?\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, all together it's an alright anime. Nothing 'new' is brought to the genre, but it is refreshing to see a 'romance' vampire anime that's dark and borderline horrific.",

The plot of this anime is basically that a young girl is sent as a sacrifice to the vampire brothers, but rather than just eating her and getting it over with, the audience is treated to absolute sadism and torment of this girl. \r\nThe brothers themselves have barely anything different about them. They are all just sadistic pricks who want to suck Yui's blood, and have no real defining character traits outside of that. Yui herself just gets tormented and abused no matter what, and most of the anime is just hearing her cryin pain as one of the 7 interchangeable bishies torture and verbally abuse her. Not a single character in this anime gets any sort of development or becomes more likable in the slightest.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the art and music are technically good, I still don't think that is a reason to subject yourself to this trainwreck of an anime. The art isn't anything mindblowing, and certainly won't save this anime from the fact that it's unwatchable. While there are worse animes out there, Diabolik Lovers is still hard to watch, and giving it 1 star is generous.",

Yui's \"awakening\" was a cool plot point to add in and I loved learning about the backstories of the characters. As you watch the show, you begin to understand why the characters act the way they do.\r\nThe animation's fine...but the art's freaking amazing. It's different but in a good way. Their eyes have multiple colors in them and it really adds to the looks of the characters. \r\nThe sound is another thing this animedid right. A lot of the music is really nice to listen to and it fits the moment. They have music for when the characters do their usual vampire thing (drinking blood) and for when things just get intense and action packed. But, I will admit that the sound effects are kinda cringey. It's not cringey in a bad way, it just sounds a bit weird when they bite Yui. It sounds like they're biting into a fruit...\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, all the guy characters seem fine. They all have consistent personalities, flaws, and strengths like characters should. Then there's Yui... To be honest, when I watched this anime for the first time, Yui's personality was the one thing I really didn't like. She's so passive and even when she says \"deteitte\" or \"get out\" there's hardly any force behind her words. It's like she barely tries to put up a fight. As a character, Yui's annoying at times (for multiple reasons) but, eventually, you end up remembering her situation and then you just feel a little bad for her. She almost feels out of place. (Then again, taking characters out of their comfort zones is something that people do.)\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9 \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10 (Beautiful)\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10 (Sound as in the songs and OSTs)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8 (The sound effects made me cringe a little at times. Other than that, everything's good.)\\n\\n\r\nDiabolik Lovers isn't too special since it's just a vampire harem anime but it did have some good ideas with the plot. Overall, it gets a 9.",

I wanted so badly to like it... the art style drew me in instantly, and when I found out that it was a vampire anime, I was all the more interested. But I think I barely got through three episodes before I tapped out. I see a lot of people defending it, saying it's a story of sadism and masochism, and others saying its horror... but sadism/masochism is a consensual relationship, this was not. In the episodes I watched, thisgirl was clearly not on board with this, clearly not interested, and continued to say no and to struggle. And as far as horror goes.. ok... but there was such a strong sexual component to it that it didn't come across as horror, it came across as a rape fantasy that is repeated over and over again. Them forcibly taking her blood - in a very sexually suggestive manner - is a metaphor for rape. I can't believe this got a second season. \\n\\n\r\nI really wish I had read some reviews before watching because I would never have picked it up. If you are looking for a dark but romantic anime, this anime is NOT for you. If you are sensitive to rape and abuse, this anime is NOT for you. \\n\\n\r\nThere is no romance here... just darkness... and the glorification of what is essentially rape and abuse. The main female character is abused and manipulated, the vampires' blood taking is essentially rape. She is physically and verbally abused - and according to many of those that have watched the anime all the way through, sexually abused at one point - and treated like both a plaything and like cattle. At no point in what I watched was the girl consulted about her own fate, nor were any of the boys' actions stopped. \\n\\n\r\nSuffice to say, I will not be continuing this anime. If you really enjoyed this anime and got something totally different from it, then more power to you... we all have our kinks... but people really should be warned before watching. Abuse and assault is so common you never know who has gone through something that would make watching this anime an incredibly unpleasant experience.",

It's average compared to some of the stuff I have seen and watched. If not particular bad. 6/10\\n\\n\r\nSound- The opening fits Twilight the anime version but I could care less about it. The voice acting was alright for the most part, the person voicing the girl was the only bad one to me out of all of them. Overall it gets a 4/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- These guys...Ha....They were this close to beating out Madicko Douchebago (Makoto Itou...or whatever the hell you want to call him. Don't give a damn if he was written like he was, I don't like those type of people either way so he doesn't get a pass as far as I am concerned) This close...but they just missed out of beating him out of my most hated characters in anime in general. So close. Then there is the girl...absolute f*cking example of a damsel in distress that can't do jack diddly. Overall the characters ranging from the psycho kid to the guy calling her 'little bitch' get a 1/10 \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- ....It's twilight the anime version. Need I say more people.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- In the end this show is mainly for people into masochist type sh*t or guys that like seeing girls get abused. The only ok qualities were the art and sound for the most part. Overall the show gets a 2/10 from me.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said I am out people. Peace!",

            "content": "I've can only find negative reviews while the overall grade of the show is 5.6, so I'm here to give a review from the perspective of a 6-7 average.\r\nI don't think anyone is going to go into this show looking for a masterpiece, because let's be real, the people who watch reverse harems (like myself) are really just in it for shits and giggles. It's not something that is meant to be compared to bigger shows like Fullmetal or something, but shows of its kind. That's why its ratings are so poor.\r\nFirstly, I would like to point out that there are some major flaws inthe way the developers decided to market these characters. Having a troubled bad boy character is perfectly acceptable, but they crossed the line with (what was basically) rape, harassment, and misogyny. The characters are flawed beyond redemption and their disgusting treatment of Yui should not be the highlight of the show.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5\\n\\n\r\nIt's alright. Not amazing or terrible, just enough to keep viewers watching in hopes that something will actually happen. (Which unfortunately, nothing does lol). \\n\\n\r\nInitially, the setup and everything was good and I was curious to see where it went (and I also really enjoyed the boys' backstories). While it wasn't really unique, I thought it was interesting and it laid the groundwork for some awesome storytelling and secrets. \\n\\n\r\nI gave it a 5 because while the build up was nice, the execution really flopped and I was left with more questions than answers, especially with the third season no where in sight.\\n\\n\r\nWhat really saves this score were the flashbacks. I found them interesting and they were the only thing that made me feel bad for the brothers. The approach the show took to their father and his wives was new to me, and while it was uncomfortable from a moral and feminist standpoint, it wasn't praised in any way by the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThey took a lot of risks by touching on dark topics like rape of minors by parents, crippling abuse, and broken family life. You don't see these things in anime often, especially not romance, so I applaud them for that. Now, I'm not sure if these topics belongs in a romance, but this is marketed as a dark story and the characters need a reason to be so fucked up, so I understand including it. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10 (100 if possible lol)\\n\\n\r\nI don't care what anyone says, I adore the art! Absolutely love it.\\n\\n\r\nIt breaks off from traditional anime style and gives the story an almost gothic and romantic twist just from how the characters are drawn alone. It's a breath of fresh air after watching so much anime that looks identical. So 10 all the way.\\n\\n\r\nIf the brothers were drawn in any other way, they would have been that much more unsavory. Being pretty helps them get away with their shitty personalities lol.\\n\\n\r\nThe backgrounds were lacking most of the time, but I feel like the character designs and style make up for it. Each character had a design that matched their personality, and while it was a bit gaudy at times (the fedora or his one rolled up pants leg), it fit them well.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\\n\r\nNot gonna lie, I don't really pay attention to sound. But the dub was good in my opinion. I've definitely heard worse. \\n\\n\r\nMy only problem was the embarrassing grunts and slurping sounds. Also Yui, but she was an irritating heroine, so it fit her. \\n\\n\r\nThe background music, from what I remember, was reminiscent of gothic church choir (a good choice for all its symbolism and sacrilegious themes lol) and suspense music. It was eerie and fitting.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:3\\n\\n\r\nI'm not going to rewrite what everyone's written a thousand times. You get the gist. \\n\\n\r\nI give them a three because they were cute kids, and had a few vulnerable moments. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\\n\r\nAs a person who's a disgusting romantic and rev harem nut, I'll swallow just about anything, and this was no exception. \\n\\n\r\nThis is the type of show you watch because it's bad and silly and because you have a thing for dominant boys, not because you want to watch a riveting anime.\\n\\n\r\nYou already know what this show is like, so unless you're the same as me, don't even stress over it. If this is the type of thing you're into though, I completely recommend it because more people love it than you think.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\\n\r\nI wish they carried the storyline along better. I heard the anime did the video game injustice, so it's really a shame. Aside from plot and character shortcomings, it's a hilarious watch and a fun way to spend the afternoon.",

            "content": "If I had to sum up this anime in two words that would be - missed potential.\r\nDiabolik lovers has wonderful artwork and soundtrack, and relatively interesting characters,  however the story felt incredibly incomplete. The main character has little to no character development whatsoever, preventing the series from growing to an satisfying extent. Yui is an adorable and kind character, however her naivete is incredibly frustrating and the reason why this anime has many bad reviews.  Her inability to grow was incredibly frustrating to the viewer. \r\nUnfortunately, the lack of character development made the story incredibly dull and predictable. Yui wakes up, wonders whereshe is, one of the vampire brothers appears and mocks her, then drinks her blood. The same repetition happening again and again with vague hints of character development and hidden storylines mixed in - but never explored to the extent needed to make sense. The vampires and Yui's backstories are also vague.\\n\\n\r\nThe male vampires were interesting. Their abusive behaviour cannot be justified, but understandable, in the sense that they loathe humanity and view humans as only livestock. Although, as stated earlier, there were hints of some sympathy from the vampires in different situations for Yui.\\n\r\n It felt like throughout the series the vampire brothers just needed some persuasion, something from the main character besides her blood to create a better plotline. Unfortunately, Yui's fragile status and personality made it impossible for there to be any true connection between her and the brothers. She had no outside support, and had no self defense training, rendering her a useless blood bag.\\n\\n\r\nTherefore, in the end. This anime has interesting characters, soundtrack, and artwork, but an incredibly cliche and dull story with no development. Best to stick with fanfics if you want any reprieve from this terrible script.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "*I would like to preface this with I have not played the games and this was my introduction to the series as a whole*\r\nWell that was absolutely dreadful. I am not sure who thought it was a good idea to turn a dating sim into an anime but they really did not think it through very well. In visual novel style you have some control over the path that you take and the characters at least stand a chance of development and growth. There is time allotted for you to develop an interest in the characters, the plot, and the romance. Without the ability tochoose that path all you are left with is cheap pandering torture porn that is not even well done. \\n\\n\r\nAs far as the art is concerned, I actually really liked it. That is the main thing that drew me to this dumpster fire of a production. The characters are genuinely attractive to look at. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is okay I suppose although it does sound like you are watching a cheap low quality hentai during many scenes. Lots of dramatic breathing, screaming, and moaning. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are hard to rate as you do not get the opportunity to learn really anything about them besides the fact that they are a harem of brothers that happen to be vampires. I will say that the anime makes you want to know more about certain characters and that may lead you to delve into the numerous games involving them but the anime itself is really lacking in the character department. They are just blank empty shells thrusting abuse in every direction. \\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment of this series was very limited. There is one character that peaked my interest and the art is nice enough but that is really where my enjoyment stopped. If you are a masochist you may enjoy projecting yourself onto the blank slate of the heroine, if you are a sadist that likes to watch women suffer you may find yourself projecting yourself onto one of the numerous abuse inflicting vampires on screen, and if you are a fan of oh so edgy harems you may enjoy the premise of it. \\n\\n\r\nIf you found yourself enjoying this, even if just enjoying the idea of the premise, I advise and implore you to check out the games and other source materials. This anime is garbage but the rest does not have to be. I will likely not take my own advice as this anime ruined it for me.",

I could be rewatching Evangelion or Kill La Kill or even playing something decent. Anything but this. \r\nLet's start with the story: It doesn't exist. It starts off by dropping this random girl into a mansion (that has a swimming pool INSIDE) full of Vampires. By full I mean 6. Then the story just stops and it's like 9 chapters of the vampires sucking her. And for some reason, the marks of the fangs dissapear the next chapter. The girl alsohas infinite blood since she doesn't even get anemia or something, even though she gets sucked like 7 times a day. ok\\n\\n\r\n~~ Spoiler Time ~~\\n\\n\r\nWell, chapter 9 or 10 is basically saying that the girl has the heart of the mother of 3 of the vampires (which they killed), so she possesses\\n\r\nwait\\n\r\nposees-\\n\r\nfuck\\n\r\nshe gets inside her body and claims it as her own.\\n\r\nThen some stuff happens and everything fixes itself magically.\\n\r\nThe end.\\n\r\nI could also say that there's this guy named Richter that planned the whole thing and something but he appears like 3 times and isn't that relevant.\\n\\n\r\n~~ Spoiler Time Ended ~~\\n\\n\r\nso the story is really bad\\n\\n\r\nThe art is pretty and the animation is kinda good.

They put hyper-tense music when hyper-tense things are not even happening at all. And the hyper-tense music isn't good. The opening is... alright, and I didn't listen to the ending theme because I seriously wanted this to be over as soon as possible.\\n\\n\r\nAnd so it begins: the characters.\\n\r\nThey are the worst thing ever.\\n\r\nThe protagonist just let's the vampires suck her blood without any opposition at all and doesn't even try to run away from them.\\n\r\nThe vampires are all so flat, so fucking bland that I only really remember one of them: Subaru.\\n\r\nBecause he is not a complete dick or fucking crazy. Also he doesn't want to suck blood 24/7.\\n\r\nI don't know where to put this thing, but the script is fucking horrible. The characters all say stupid shit and it never stops. Never. I'll just put one of the most memorable quotes (because it is really stupid) right here.\\n\r\n\"I'LL DESTROY YOU, NOT ONLY YOUR BODY, BUT ALSO YOUR SOUL!!! *dramatically throws flowers*\"\\n\\n\r\ni didn't enjoy this at all\\n\r\n8.7/10 - not enough blood sucking\\n\\n\r\nI can only say one thing about this show, and it basically sums up everything: \\n\\n\r\nwhy does this exist",

There is little to no plot. Seriously, every episode is just them abusing the protagonist--Yui. And in every episode, one of them will suck her blood. Sure, the art is pretty and all, but the plot only emerges in the last few episodes of the anime. And it gets resolved in said episodes. The characters are charming sadistic pricks, who are displayed terribly, but even so,they're probably the only reason why this anime has fans.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is an adaptation of the otome game. And I'm going to state the obvious: The games are 100% better than the anime. They dragged me back into this hell, and I unintentionally fell for it. Only problem for people who want to play the game is that its only Japanese, no English subtitles. Otherwise, the games are actually pretty enjoyable, they did a much better job displaying the characters (and that's because you can choose to focus on one character) and the games actually did have a plot written. I had a lot of fun. So if you really want to enjoy this series, and you can read Japanese sentences (With lots of Kanji), then go play the games.\\n\\n\r\n A lot of fans you see aren't going to say this, because most seem to come from the anime for some questionable reason, but the reality is: the anime is absolutely no good. Its absolute garbage. I wish they did a better job on it. \\n\\n\r\nI'd recommend skipping it if you enjoy anime with actual plot. \\n\r\nHell, I probably wouldn't recommend even if you do like sadistic vamps. Because this is just plain bad.\\n",

            "content": "Right off the bat I have to warn you: this isn't a romance, nor is it tagged as one here on MAL. Most of us fangirls jump to the conclusion it /has/ to be one, considering it's the typical reverse harem scenario with the vampire twist to it, but this anime never claims to be romantic, thankfully so. All of the interactions between the female lead and the vampires is anything but romantic nor ideal, they're mysoginistic and lack consent and they're overall terrible examples for how boys should behave around girls. But they didn't have to be, because again, this isn't meant to bea love story.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, I'd consider this anime a somewhat failed attempt at a horror flick, even if it has its creepy moments. It doesn't involve any jumpscares or overall tense situations like most generic horror plots nowadays, but instead it focus on extremely condemning actions carried out by all of the vampire leads. I think the best attempt at horror in the whole show is Kanato's character, he's creepy right off the back and there is never any hidden meanings behind his interactions with the female lead besides genuinely terrifying scenarios. If all vampires had the same athmosphere as he did, this show would have been better and we might have even been able to consider it a genuine attempt at horror. Sadly, you mostly get more non-con scenarios than the ones involving Kanato, so there's a lot of lost potential in that area.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I didn't finish the anime, mostly because I got bored. There wasn't enough focus on Kanato to keep me going as a fan of horror, so the show quickly became dull. But I can say that there is definitely a small niche for Diabolik Lovers. If you love characters that give you the creeps from how borderline insane they are, you're going to enjoy Kanato. Sadly, you're not really going to enjoy much else. And if you're looking for any sort of romance, don't bother watching, because you're not going to find any.\\n\\n\r\nI'd just like to finish by saying I understand everyone condemning the vampires in their reviews, because they're behaviour is abominal, however I feel like everyone's still seeing them as potential romantic interests to the female lead, hence why it's so harshly judged. If you regard Diabolik Lovers as a somewhat creepy cautionary tale on the whole vampire craze we had a couple of years ago, you quickly realize the fact everyone is so reprehensable is one of the best parts of the anime. There was no sugarcoating the vampire fantasy. There were no indications girls should aspire to experience what Yui did. It was just out there for us to judge for ourselves because they knew how terrible the vampires were being and I think that's how you should regard this series as well.",

            "content": "Let me be honest, I enjoyed this anime. Wait right there! I am not done yet. I completely agree with other reviewers, this anime is not a good one. Not at all, but that doesn't mean it doesn't have its appeal. I want to say the male characters are all the yandere type, but they don't really seem to care about the protagonist at all. She's basically food to them. They are aggressive, verbally abusive, and deplorable. If there was any sex in this anime, it'd be down right rape time and time again, but of course, there is none, but you get what Imean, right?\\n\r\nI enjoy kabe-don and aggressive guys. I won't lie, my heart jumped when I saw the first few episodes. I've read a lot of smut out there and you know what? Rape or forcing yourself on a girl is apparently a big thing, so yeah, I can't be mad at this anime for providing Japanese girls/women with the excitement that they like. Hell, I'll take it from time to time.\\n\r\nHowever, after you get into this for a while, you notice how thin the plot line is. There's barely a plot. I watched all 12 episodes and the parts with \"action\" don't really make sense to me and it's resolved rather quickly. Yeah, I think this anime is about the fan service.\\n\r\nEveryone gets mad that this anime is about a bunch of vampires that violate the protagonist over and over. Well, you know what? Brother's Conflict is like that too, without all of the sex sounds (i.e. slurping blood). They're vampires so I assume it's supposed to appeal to the inner pervert in women. Like it or not, there's a market out there for it. Especially if you're sexually frustrated.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, the characters are more or less....shallow? You get a small glimpse into what makes some of them tick, but not entirely. There is so much hate amongst them all. I think there's a shota in this anime (which doesn't make sense since they're triplets...How did one manage to stay tiny?) and he just terrifies me. He's the most violent of them all. The megane character is just plain annoying. He yells at the main character for everything from bad table manners (even though all of his brothers just left the table or were entirely rude) and breaking something after he did something to her. What the hell is that? This is like the opposite of brother's conflict: everyone hates everyone else and is violent and mean to the main character. \\n\\n\r\nThe artwork? Well, that's pretty much where this anime excels. The artwork is beautifully done. The sound is pretty decent, but nothing to write home about, but what makes an anime is the plot and the characters. If you can't like the characters, you can't invest yourself in it! \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed myself a fair amount. Like I said, there's a market for this type of aggressive and violent love (?!) affair. If the characters actually showed any type of compassion for the main character, maybe it'd be more enjoyable. I hope the sequel will be better.",

He had some charactergrowth but not much.\\n\\n\r\nThe premise was amusing and I like the return to more \"traditional\" vampires (i.e. human=food or toy not necessarily love interest).\\n\\n\r\nThe game probably makes more sense (and I'd be interested to play it) but since it's not available in English I kind of wish they'd make a second season of the anime just to tie up all the lose ends from the first season.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it's sadistic fluff",

            "content": "Story: 4/10 *May Contain Spoilers*\r\nSummary: Diabolik Lovers takes place in a creepy old castle in the middle of nowhere. The main character is a young girl named Yui whose father just drops her off to live in this mysterious castle. Upon her arrival, she finds out that she will be living with six blood lusting vampires.\r\nOkay where do I start with this story? It definitely isn\u2019t for everyone. The whole thing starts off entirely predictable. 6 good looking vampires all want to drink from our female heroine. And being your typical female anime character, she lets them. Pretty much the entire first 6-8 episodes (thereare only 12) is just her wandering around this castle running into these guys and them demanding that she let them suck her blood. That\u2019s it. They are cruel and nasty to her but after days of living in this place, Yui continues to let them physically and emotionally abuse her. It isn\u2019t until nearly the very end when you actually get told what why she\u2019s there or what\u2019s actually going on. (I won\u2019t spoil that for anyone who chooses to watch). The story could have been made better but they just didn\u2019t develop it enough. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nOkay, the characters are one of the more pathetic things about this anime. First I\u2019ll start with Yui. Like I said previously, she\u2019s in this house, she clearly doesn\u2019t like the fact that these vampires are abusing her but she keeps letting it happen. For heaven\u2019s sake one of them even gives her the opportunity to leave and he decides to stay because she\u2019s curious about what\u2019s going on. Yui legit has zero growth in this show. She\u2019s just a static, pathetic blob. The rest of the characters are these six brothers. I won\u2019t go into detail on each one because that would be pointless. But the only way I can describe them is that they are glorious assholes. They do as they please to Yui and they really don\u2019t care about her feelings at all. They treat her like a slave. One of them continually calls her a derogatory name and she never once gets angry at him for it. I kept waiting for one of them to show her a little bit of kindness. Like perhaps a knight in shining armor amongst all of the rest of them. But there wasn\u2019t. At the end you get the impression that one of them might have some feelings for her but they\u2019re still selfish feelings, not ones with Yui in mind at all. Again, none of the brothers ever show any real growth. They never feel any remorse for what they have done in their past (which you will see if you watch) and they only care about themselves. They don\u2019t even really seem to care about each other. The only reason I didn\u2019t give the characters a lower score was because I thought the writers did an excellent job of portraying them as such wicked people.\\n\\n\r\nMusic 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe music was one of the more redeeming factors in this anime. It fit the macabre theme really well. It was one of the things that helped me get into the cliche one dimensional story. The theme song was pretty good too. Especially the music they use in the first episode. \\n\\n\r\nAlong with music I\u2019m just going to add in something about sound. I want to warn anyone considering watching this anime that there is an absurd amount of disgusting slurping and sucking sounds when the vampires are biting Yui. It really got on my nerves. It sounded more like they were biting into a crisp apple.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and the art style in this anime was definitely its best quality by far. Everything is beautifully drawn and animated. It\u2019s a reverse harem anime so the boys in it, while evil to the core are quite pretty to watch. Also if you love the whole gothic style this anime will definitely fulfill your fancy. Though if the art style is the only thing that will catch your eye then it\u2019s probably not worth your time.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nIf the animation hadn\u2019t been as good as it was I would have scored this a bit lower. I really don\u2019t recommend this anime to anyone who doesn\u2019t like the vampire genre, reverse harem, stupid main characters or lots of blood. I will say that for whatever reason it deep keep me watching which was a good thing I guess. I marathoned it in less than 24 hours. It\u2019s twelve episodes and they\u2019re only 14 minutes long so it goes pretty fast. So if you\u2019re curious it won\u2019t be a complete waste of time. If you like English dubbed the entire series is on Youtube in one video. And if you watch it and like it,  Season 2 airs this October (2015) and there is an OVA.",

            "content": "The only way anyone can enjoy this anime is if they were to look at it as a horror anime (which was how I was able to give it a four). But you have to be able to get past the immense abuse the main character is put through. And get past the fact that the title says \"Lovers\" and all the guys are sadistic masochists who get off on fear and inflicting pain. Yui is barely even treated like a human being, but rather a piece of food. There's nothing remotely romantic about that.\r\nThe only thing that keeps you watching is the constant unknownof who Yui really is and other mysteries throughout. And I enjoyed the art (except for Yui's hair, the ombre effect was a little odd).\\n\\n\r\nI also was intrigued by how the brothers kept having flashbacks whenever Yui touched them or interacted with them in some way, but that kept ending in them drinking her blood. They even went as far as to try to make Ayato's seem romantic and started to show his last bit of humanity... before he drank her blood even though he knew she was drowning (but as soon as he kissed her she suddenly wasn't struggling for air anymore???). \\n\\n\r\nThe show had potential, truly, but it fell flat and I don't have much desire to go further. Of course, I still want to know who Yui is, who was the woman in the window, etc etc, but I feel like my time could be better spent. If they had drawn from the one moment of Ayato's humanity came through and continued playing on that, this really could have gone somewhere, but with where it's going now they're all manipulative, possessive, abusive animals who see Yui as a blood bag (and that's all the writers saw her as too, or so it seems). I wasn't expecting the vampires to be extremely kind to her like this was some Twilight remake, but I also wasn't expecting the entire show so far to be based around them getting off on her pain and that really be it for them (besides their pent up hatred). Just something to make it a bit more worthwhile to watch and less like I'm watching a potential rape scene every five minutes.\\n\\n\r\nAlso Laito's little nickname for Yui is so overused it's ridiculous. Use it once, fine, but he didn't need to use every single time he addressed her.",

            "content": "Essentially a Dating Sim turned Anime, this features your typical story of a single boy/girl being forced to live with/live near a large group of the opposite gender. Only this takes a much more disturbing turn when she's sent 'from the church' to be a 'prospective bride', though she's never told of this. Instead the main character is simply told 'Hey, we're sending you to this place to live. Bye.\"\r\nNo, not because the characters are vampires. That's not a problem at all. It's due to the fact that the male cast all openly abuse the main female character in every. Single. Episode. Pushing her, yankingher about, strangling her, calling her worthless and pathetic, laughing when she falls, playing mind games, and oh, did I mention talking about draining her and having her stuffed and mounted while draining her in a room full of women that had been previously drained, stuffed and mounted like taxidermist pieces? One of the characters even makes a habit of calling the main character \"Bitch-chan\". And the biting. Let's not forget the biting. Everyone bites her at least once it seems.\\n\\n\r\nOf course she does stay. And she puts up with their abuse because obviously, if she gets to know them things will get better! :I Right. And no, it doesn't. There's absolutely no character growth and we find out very, VERY little about all of the characters. Most of the buildup and climax happens during the last few episodes and it really isn't much of a payoff. Not enough to justify sitting through so much abuse.\\n\\n\r\nThe style of animation is alright but somehow seems cheap. like it was done in colored pencil or something. The sound is fine, though some of the sound effects are a bit weird (rain drops on concrete sound like a dripping faucet in a metal sink?).\\n\\n\r\nIf you can tolerate the abuse, poor excuse for a 'story', weird apple crunching while biting necks (and other body parts), and the abuse.... yeah, no. I wouldn't recommend this to a soul. Just no.",

            "content": "I close friend of mine highly recommended me an anime entitled 'Diabolik Lovers', the title itself says that there's gonna be a handful of romance. My theory of 'romance' as one of it's genre wasn't all that true, rather it was mostly suspense and vampire. Before watching the anime, the same friend told me to read 'Diabolik Lovers Anthology' manga. I found myself lost and furious, 'why is she not defending herself?!' the words kept circling around my head..I soon cutoff from reading it and heck with the manga, I watched the anime. \r\nStory [5] -- I'm not really a big fan of vampire themedanimes, and Diabolik Lovers is one reason why I still dislike the genre.The story isn't all cliche, it had it's own mix to it. For instance, the mysterious woman that Yui saw at the end of episode one and how will the brothers deal with their uncontrollable lust for human blood. But one of the many reasons why I don't like it is because (i think) the pace was a bit too fast were in I couldn't catch up. The fact that Yui ended up in a place where she wasn't much welcomed and she was somehow naive throughout the whole anime! I also disliked the way she acts when she is being bitten by one of the vampires, she doesn't even make much effort to stop them--it's like she is enjoying it very much! She may not have a big chance to stop being bitten but she should at least show an effort! I skipped a few episodes so I can't say much of the story, but from my point of view, it isn't that special.\\n\\n\r\nArt [7] -- The art is fitting to the atmosphere of the anime, dark and suspense. From the gate of the mansion to the rest of the backgrounds, it really was stunning.  All of them were drawn  ideally except Subaru's eyes on his hair and a few other points. The character design is okay but it could be improved--were in they will not look like a Korean boy band.The animation isn't that special, it's just average.\\n\\n\r\nSound [9] -- I honestly didn't payed much attention to the soundtrack, it wasn't the best I've heard but it's good. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters  [8]-- I somehow didn't like how some characters acted, though I feel horrible for Yui. Every vampire acted like a bad ass and they would scare the hell out of Yui about wanting to suck her blood, it was an average vampire attitude. Though I would like to point out how cool and awesome Shu is. :3\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment [3] -- Sorry but I didn't had much fun, I simply had a poker face on while watching. It was either because I'm a heartless spawn of satan or I just don't like the flow of the anime. But this is just an opinion, half of the people I knew who watched this got addicted over this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall [2] -- Unfortunately, Diabolik Lovers did not contain that special element that would (somehow) change my perspective on the vampire genre. At the end of the day Diabolik Lovers is just one good art with reverse harem written all over it.",

            "content": "Okay, so before I watched this series, I'd seen multiple images posted online and people in general saying how it was a pretty good anime, but how bitterly disappointed was I when I actually decided to watch the series. The whole of Diabolik Lovers was incredibly difficult to watch due to the nonexistent character development, essentially nonexistent plot line and very basic artwork which came together to make this one of the most unbearable series I've yet to encounter. \r\nGoing into more detail, this series tried and failed in attempting to successfully use the commonly misused harem technique, and gave up on bothering to havea plot and instead just cheaply featured the relatively hot boys which didn't do much and couldn't express their feelings well, and because of the lack of character development, this was all they did. \\n\\n\r\nI was also particularly disappointed by the main female protagonist, who was quite literally the embodiment of a sexist depiction of the 'damsel in distress' and couldn't stand on her own two feet. She added nothing to the story, and as the series progressed, she didn't change at all, but rather remained the same as at the beginning. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, I must stress the point that the idea behind Diabolic Lovers was an interesting concept and  relatively original, but it was destroyed by the lack of character development and terrible plot line.\\n\\n\\n",

I loved Laito even tho the whole Bitch-Chan thing was annoying at times, and yes the girl was abused by each brother but what were u guys expecting? A 12 episode series with vampires and a girl holding hands and skipping merrily? Be realistic and know what type of series your about to get in to. Yes the plot was very little explained and the backgrounds for the characters weren't in depthbut I was still able to get the gist of it by reading the game summaries and the character backgrounds. Overall I agree it could have been much better but it did in fact catch my interest and the boys were truly amazing in sadist/sinful ways but that's what makes people talk about them. So I think the creators did their jobs because we're still talking about it and reviewing it....god or bad.",

            "content": "If you were to describe this show with two words, it would definitely be either \"car crash\" or \"train wreck\", for it is a truly dreadful scenario that you can't stop looking at (for some odd reason). \r\nBy combining the very popular (and cheerful) themes of sadism, masochism, misogyny, slavery and rape in the worst possible manner, this thing makes Twilight (hell, even Fifty Shades of Grey!) seem like a masterpiece. Although the genre is labelled as \"shoujo\", this giant mess can't really decide who it's aimed at, and what emotions it wants to evoke. While its few fans may praise it for combining \"horror\",\"eeriness\", and \"creepiness\", the reality is that the only feeling this thing can evoke from viewers who still have their sanity is undoubtedly disgust. From the endless slurping sounds to the sexual innuendos and rape references to the story (or lack of) in general, you will spend your time wondering as to\\n\r\n1) Why did I ever start watching this crap? \\n\r\n2) Will it ever get better? \\n\\n\r\nWhile there may be no viable answer for the first question, I can guarantee you that this show never gets better, develops a plot, or even has a logical ending that will explain the little bits of \"mystery\" that may have kept you watching till the end. \\n\\n\r\nAs if that wasn't enough, the characters are completely unlikeable and unrelatable,  with every single one of the vampires being evil and sadistic and the protagonist being truly pathetic (maybe they kept saying that she was totally worthless and nicknamed her Little Bitch for a reason). Unsurprisingly, all your hope for character and plot development will also quickly die away, for as soon as you start thinking that one of the vampires will do something different, they always prove you wrong and continue to \\n\r\n1) bite the girl \\n\r\n2) hear her protesting (quite pathetically) for 2 seconds, and \\n\r\n3) proceed to tell her to shut up. \\n\\n\r\nThis experience is enhanced with the slurping and licking sounds mentioned above, as well as an extremely generic OST which sounds like a cheap ripoff from Yuki Kajiura. \\n\\n\r\nLike most people who got into this mess, you may probably think that this anime does have a single redeeming quality - its art. While that may appear to be true initially, you will eventually realize that there is no point in watching a story that combines such great art with such horrible execution (and actually kills off some of your brain cells in the process). \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is an appalling show to watch and should be avoided like the plague. However, if you do decide to watch \"Diabolik Lovers\" (or \"Rape Race\", as I like to call it), be warned that you will not even be able to feel pity for the useless main character or the sadistic supporting ones. The only people to pity here are those who had to provide their voices for this crap as well as those who had to endure all of its faults while watching it. \\n\\n\r\nPS: You've been warned. Here's to 3 hours of your life that you'll never get back.",

            "content": "Well, I binge watched this whole anime and I have almost nothing good to say about it after finishing. The art style is pretty cool, I thought it was pretty good and I usually like this kind of art style, and it's got pretty solid voice acting. Buuuut that's pretty much where my enjoyment for it ends.\r\nWow, I hated almost every single one of these characters. First of all, the main girl, Yui, is a little Mary Sue pushover that doesn't have an inkling of a personality let alone willpower. At first I felt bad for her but as the show went on, I completelylost all sympathy for her and she just began irritating me everytime I saw her. She does ABSOLUTELY nothing the entire show, even when she gets a chance to do something and change her situation, What does she do? Zip! I know that this was from an otome game and that's why she's pretty much a blank slate but it wouldn't hurt to make her likable or relatable.(sigh) \\n\\n\r\nNow let's talk about the so called \"vampires\". Now I have to admit I ended up liking one or two of them a little bit by the end of the show, but it just didn't help me like the show anymore overall, even with the two out of, what? Six? None of them had any character development to speak of, the prick that they were at the beginning of the show is the same prick they'll be at the ending, and most of them are just huge douchbags with no redeemable qualities, Why the hell am I going to root for them?(But then again I wasn't rooting for Yui either so.) Every time I think they're going to do something even a little nice, it's quickly erased by whatever they say or do next.1 step forward 5 steps back is the motto of this show. \\n\\n\r\n\"I found the story really intriguing and couldn't get enough of it.\" Is what I wish I could say here >,< I actually would talk about the story now if I thought there was one. It was just Yui getting passed around the guys like a bag of chips and a who could treat her the douchiest contest all up until the second or third to last episode. There wasn't any real story and the story at the end was so rushed and uninteresting that I forgot about most of it as soon as it was over.\\n\\n\r\nMany people told me that the game was a lot better than this so I looked into it and read about the story and characters on the game sites and wikia. I also watched some game clips, just cause I like to torture myself >.< But I have to agree with them, it seems like a pretty decent game from what I read and watched, so I don't know why this anime was so god awful. You know your anime has failed when reading about it online has more story and character development than watching it. So if you for some reason want to watch this I suggest playing the game and not wasting your time with this, you'll get a lot more out of it.",

Except the fact that they are all sadistic and problematic characters their backstories make them at least sympathetic and explains the reasons why they are like that and it makes you feel for them.This anime has no plot or character development ,I don't even think there was a plot and even if there was one it was boring and forgettable,personaly I don't remember any plot.You might say that there was an improvement in the last episode when they \"care\" for Yui and try to save her  .The fuckers just want her blood ,not her.The only character who I deem just a little bit sane in this god forsaken anime is Subaru ,coz you know,he actually tries to help our shit for brains main character and doesn't want to drink her blood,tho not because he cares for this girl ,she just reminds him of his mother,just a little bit tho and he also doesn't want to accept her because his father brought Yui as a sacrificial bride (even tho he does drink her blood like twice out of his instinct )but even he is a really problematic character.I do not now about the game or how good or bad it is but this anime is just too terrible.Also I am surprised that this girl doesn't die on the first three episodes because of the large amounts of blood  she looses or doesn't have anemia at the end of the series.\\n\r\nTo sum it all up :\\n\r\nThis anime has shitty and problematic characters,tons of sexual abuse ,no plot at all for which even the art (that is actually not bad) and the decent voice acting can't make up for.Do not watch this anime ,you'll only waste your time even if you end up enjoying it.",

There are a lot of thing wrong with this show, so let's start with the story. SO MANY SPOILERS! AND CURSING! (I am VERY passive-aggressive about this crap show. Well, not really passive.)\r\nStory; There is none. Really. All you see is a girl getting vampire-raped (and possibly actual raped) repeatedly by vampires. There's even a freaking bloodsucking rape threesome. It was honestly terrifying. And then, when there are like 3 episodes left, they startputting in all of this bullshit Oedipus crap. Freud would have ADORED this show. I think Yui got possessed by their mom, and hooked up with the uncle? Or something? All I know is that the mom started making out with her stepson and it was disgusting.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The one saving grace. The art probably deceived so many people into thinking this would be a good anime. I mean, the vampire dudes are actually pretty hot, and the heroine is pretty. The clothes and backgrounds have nice, interesting design. It LOOKS like a good anime. But it is not. It is not.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Forgettable. the op was typical reverse harem, all the guys singing at you. Creepy. I ignored the ed. And the voice acting was mildly painful, as they must have forced the actors to be in the show. Good actors. Sad. And a heads-up, there is constant slurping and licking sounds that will send shivers up your spine, but in a bad way. I would say to mute it, but it is CONSTANT.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter; Where to begin?\\n\r\nYui (the heroine); Spineless and stupid. When she realizes that she is essentially trapped in a horrific Twilight x 50 Shades of Grey parody, the first thing she does is call her dad, not 911. To be specific, her father, the one who sent her to this hell. And she is so stupid. She has the opportunity to escape, and she goes to a church. Really? Not the cops? You can pray just as well in a police station, dearie. And can I mention the fact that she doesn't even struggle when they suck her blood? Like, not even a little. And apparently she is a magical blood bag, because I'm pretty sure she died from blood loss in the first episode. unless of course, she drank some of that elixir from Baccano, which would explain how NONE OF THOSE BITE MARKS STAY ON HER BODY LONGER THAN 3 SECONDS. And when that idiot gave her a vampire-killing knife, she didn't use it on him immediately. Or on any of the brothers. At all. I feel like she probably liked living there. Masochist.\\n\\n\r\nI cannot remember half of those vampires names, but here I go;\\n\\n\r\nLaito (aka, Hat bastard); I hate this guy so much. Maybe the hat was a hint that he was a sack of shit. Literally as soon as she gets into the house, he picks probably the most insulting possible name for her. 'Little bitch'. He just starts calling her that, for THE ENTIRE SHOW. And did I mention he rapes her in a church? Because I am 101% sure he does. And Yui literally does not care that she'd being raped, but she complains that he's doing it in a church.  WHAT KIND OF HUMAN BEING GIVES A SHIT WHERE THEY ARE BEING RAPED! A normal person would say; STOP RAPING ME. But she says: 'You can't do that in a church! It's sacrilegious!' I hate that bastard. \\n\\n\r\nAyato (aka rapist bastard); He is (quite obviously) the love interest. Even though, he constantly drinks her blood, threatens her, and actually once tries to drown her. And then sucks her blood underwater. There are so many things wrong with this show, but one thing I must point out; he forces her to skip class and make food for him. Human food. And then he eats it, and clearly enjoys eating it. And the other brothers are seen eating human food. So why the hell do they have to suck her blood? I think it's because they all hate her. I hate this SOB too. Literally, he is a son of a bitch, because his mom is a bitch. Also, don't roll up one pant leg, you prick. Roll them both or neither. it makes you look like a drooling incompetent who can't dress himself.\\n\\n\r\nGlasses bastard; Super sadist. He doesn't care if the main character gets raped, as long as it's in their bedroom. He threatened to whip her. Really? This is like five minutes after you threatened to kill her. Make up your damn mind. Freak. \\n\\n\r\nInsane shota bastard; He talks to his fucking teddy bear. He stabbed his potatoes to death. He fell off the roof and (sadly) didn't die. Need I say more? He is an insane, 12 year-old looking bastard. I hate him.\\n\\n\r\nSleeping headphone bastard; Is somewhat more tolerable, if only because he has less screentime. But in his screentime, he makes sure to make you despise him. Wears headphones in the bath because he's that fucking edgy. Can I mention that dumbass heroine actually went to this guy for help once? And to NO ONES surprise, he sucked her blood. And she was surprised. Really? And this was like the 10th episode. She should have seen that shit coming, honestly. I hate this guy. Fuck you and your headphones. Lazy ass.\\n\\n\r\nObligatory anger issues bastard; gives the heroine a vampire-killing knife, but she is too stupid and does not immediately stab him with it. Gives the heroine a chance to escape, but she's too stupid and stays for some fucking reason. Punches walls a lot. Attacks rose bushes. Stay classy, asshole. \\n\\n\r\n I hope this gives you an idea of how shitty everyone is in this story.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment; Not even. I actually felt like I was dying approaching the end of the show. I felt so hopeless...\\n\\n\r\n But then the show ended and I could breath again. I wish there were negative ratings on this site. I mean initially, I laughed because I was seeing so much rapey everything that is was dumb, but then it just got annoying and cringey.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Don't make my mistake. Don't watch this show. Unless you are a masochist/like rapey undertones. Then please, watch as much as possible. I give this show a 1, only because -9001 isn't a rating on this site.\\n\\n",

Diabolik Lovers is the most stupid anime that I have ever watched. I never knew there could possibly be this stupid animes out there. I don't even know where to start.\r\nEach episode is 14 minutes long (thank god). There's that oh-so-innocent main character that everyone wants to f*** . With her stupid dumbfounded look , shrieking voice and non stop screaming and running. \r\nOther characters all have different personalities which is why everyone finds their favourite one very easily,but then again there's that one that ends up with protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nIf you could summarize all the things that repeatedly happen in this anime the most annoying and common one would be \"ahhh no\" [exposes neck and puts up no fight whatsoever]. \\n\r\nAnd if you could summarize all my reactions during watching this anime it would be \"tsk [biggest eyeroll]\"\\n\\n\r\nMy overall score is f***ing lower than the one I put on Boku no Pico , and that is 1.",

The main character in this series is so naive and not in a good way. It's just annoying. \r\nI only watched this anime because no matter what i love reverse harems. And generally i don't expect much from reverse harems. But this series is unacceptable. And there's no such a thing as \"character development\" in the anime. I recently watched \"Dance with the Devils\" and was way better than this.\r\nAnd one last thing, whenit's something about vampires, we expect something different, something new. The story is boring and common. One girl and a bunch of boys who wants to suck her blood. Really? Are we supposed to enjoy this? \\n\\n\r\nIf you want to be bored to death, watch this.",

            "content": "I was appalled when I saw how many hate reviews this anime has. To start off, the main problem everyone has with this is how the guys are abusive toward the protagonist. If any of you even bothered to do a bit of research into this anime before watching it, you would have known what to expect. \r\nYes, the guys are abusive and sick. Yes, it is disturbing. But it's a very good reality check! In other vampire anime, the vamps are love-sick, sweet, and nice people. VAMPIRES ARE FUCKING BLOOD-SUCKING MONSTERS! They're not supposed to be soft and sweet. I like that about thisanime. Reality check for all you idiots.\\n\r\nNow, moving on.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory.\\n\r\nRating: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe story isn't the most original as far as vampire anime go. With the protagonist 'awakening' and all, that was pretty cliche. But what I liked about it was that the characters were all included in the story line, with their pasts related to the plot. Some of you have said that the story has no plot, but the plot only develops AFTER the characters are properly introduced, unlike some poorly structured stories. Anyway, moving on.\\n\\n\r\nArt.\\n\r\nRating: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art of this anime was probably the reason most of us decided to watch it. The hair gradient is awesome, as well as the unique eyes each of the characters have. The colours are very well done, and the art style is beautiful. Of course, having all the characters being extremely hot helps too. ;3\\n\r\nI think I don't need to explain more, 'cause all of you know how great the art is. So, next.\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\r\nRating: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe music. Nice and eerie. It really helped create the atmosphere in this anime. The opening music was stereotypical vampire anime music, but I liked it. Also, the title of the song was called, \"Mr Sadistic Night\" It really matches the anime well. Again, another clue that you people should have known that it wasn't a sweet and friendly anime >:(\\n\r\nThe characters voices sounded very good; they really suited the character they were voicing. Especially Kanato. Nice and creepy. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter.\\n\r\nRating: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters had very distinctive personalities (except for Yui). And the best thing about it is that they all had a reason why there personality was like that. With their tragic pasts. The characters were excellently designed, and they are all hot. VERY hot. But, back to the personality thing. This anime shows, through the characters, that what happens in the past can define who you will be in the future. Their separate personalities are due to their traumatising pasts.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nThis anime was very exciting. Don't take that the wrong way. I just found it very gripping and I was left on edge a couple of times, waiting to see what would happen. It's a thriller. That describes it perfectly. I really enjoyed watching it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall.\\n\r\nRating: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is one-of-a-kind. I've never seen one like it. It's a nice reality check, strange as far as harem goes, and the characters are amazing, both in appearance and personality. This anime chilled me to the bone, and disturbed me. Just as it disturbed EVERYONE. But guess what? That's the freaking PURPOSE! It's meant to have impact! And it does! I feel sorry for all the haters who can't recognise a gem of an anime when they see one.\\n\\n\r\nNote: I apologise if you are offended by anything I have said. I can be quite opinionated when reviewing an anime. Thank you for reading this.\\n",

            "content": "This show...no this horrible show is beyond my comprehension of a shojou show. This is no longer a shojou show or whatsoever because I am going to explain my point. Firstly we shall explain the bad points shall we? (cause I cant wait)\r\n However I saw the light at the end of the tunnel. A small light with its so called intriguing plot.\r\nSTORY -4\r\nWhat can I say? There was hardly any background information about the main character and we are just mysteriously thrown into a castle to start the show. (dont go in there...psst)  Well, the first I dont know half or three quarterof the freaking show was about the poor heroine being sucked out of her blood for all of the sadistic brother's entertainment. How \"sweet\". IT AINT. ITS SO DISGUSTING THE WAY THEY TREAT HER AND OK...now the reason why there is a light at the end of the tunnel. Well I highly suggest not to watch this show unless you can withstand it or your just bored and wanted some horrible anime to watch so I'm just going to state it here. If you plan to watch skip this story section. The interesting part was really who our heroine was. It got me motivated to keep watching the show and how our casts so called began to be concern (im not joking. JUST) and how to get rid of this Cordelia (who is horrible too). I rather enjoyed the so called plot during the last few episodes. BUT THIS DOES NOT SAVE THE SHOW FROM ITS NASTY INTRODUCTION AND FOLLOWING EPISODES WHICH FELT LIKE A DECADE. I WAS OFTEN LEFT WITH \"what?\". I was hardly satisfied with the ending (worse ending with no one decided AT ALL) and I dont see a happy ending for her. At least the good part was what this whole thing about Yui got into.\\n\\n\r\nART -7\\n\r\nThe art direction here is decent enough to get the job done. Nothing too flashy or to \"wow\" about. They also seem to like to blend white into the hair at the tip end where I have no reason why they did it but they did and eyes that can be seen through their hair. Animation is solid though and nothing felt weird at scenes (yes even the bite scenes...they did that better) . They used a lot of dark colours to bring out the eerie atmosphere which gets the job done.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND -7\\n\r\nThe sound is good but there was no noticeable tracks and it seems that all of the tracks prefers ochestra music except for the opening song. It gets its eerie atmosphere right and there really isn't much to say about it.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER -1\\n\r\nThis shows claim to be \"shojou\" but this wasn't. It was taken into such a sadistic world that you would feel pity for the heroine rather than supporting the male casts. The male casts are truly sadistic as they use Yui for their entertainment and blood source which was absolutely ridiculous. The whole three quarter of the show was like the whole male cast just sucking her blood and the plot just picks up towards the end. It is absolutely an insult to everyone to watch them just suck her blood while you can see that she is suffering and have problems but they just don't freaking care. Yui, our main heroine is rather empty. There is really no word to describe her except the fact that she is pathetic. She resists them for the first few episodes but she wants to stay with the male cast in the end?! EVEN THOUGH THEY TREATED HER SO BADLY?! Our male cast seem to enjoy torturing her every night and day just for her blood. Even Cordellia was such a horrible mother if you have read the spoilers in the character page of the male cast. No wonder. They don't even shed a bit of kindness towards our main character when she was clearly distressed about the truth and about herself and never help her when she needed the help towards the end. You would't root for one of them at all except for Ayato or Subaru who seems to be the only one to care for our heroine TOWARDS THE END. This show approaches the audiences in such a horrible and (excuse me) \"bitchy\" manner that you would feel disgusted with a cast they came up with.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT -3\\n\r\nThe story towards the end does not definitely save the show with its horrid introduction and episodes. It's only from episode 10 that the show had a plot. The rest of the show was just sadistic and horrible. From the cast to the story, IT WAS ALL HORRENDOUS EXCEPT FOR THE SOUND AND ART.\\n\\n\r\nI WOULD NOT RECCOMEND U TO WATCH THIS SHOW JUST DONT UNLESS YOU GOT NOTHING TO DO. IM WARNING YOU.",

And by great, I mean hilarious~! \r\nAs a reviewer who has not played the game or listened to the drama CD's, I feel that my review for the anime is less judgemental, and based more on the entertainment value that the TV series provides.  \r\nI started watching this anime with a moderate amount of knowledge based on reviews I'd read for the video game.  The first episode immediately captured my attention due to the show's animation, which I found to be stunning.  The color's werespot on as I found them suitable given the show's atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nNext were the characters, and boy were they great eye candy,(cept for Kanato and Reiji...   -____-) especially since the art is so pretty.  \\n\\n\r\nCompared to Amnesia's heroine, I thought DL's heroine was quite the doormat and dumb as well, but she had plenty of moments where she actually did try to resist the guys, despite them winning in the end.  So watching her was a lot more entertaining compared to Amnesia's emotionless and doll-like heroine.  \\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, I would love to see a second season featuring the Mukami? brothers or something like that.

            "content": "To put it bluntly, this show is like buying a packet crisps at the shop and finding out it was filled with horse dung. \r\nIf you are sensible you will hand it straight back to the shop you got it from and ask for a refund. \r\nIf that isn't enough to put you off (aka me), then you will dig to the bottom of the packet, looking for some greater meaning behind it all, and you will find none.\r\nBecause this is what this anime is. If you strip away the pretty graphics, there is literally nothing going for it.\r\nInitially it seemed okay. It tells thestory of Yui, a typical \"shoujo\" type character  who believes the world is made of marshmallows. She arrives at an undeniably nice looking mansion, the door opens, and she walks inside.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's where everything stopped being okay.\\n\\n\r\nThe first thing that happens is that she gets assaulted by a complete stranger. So, does she do something? No, of course she doesn't. She sits there, whining incessantly \"Stop it!\" or other lines similar to the example given. This happens with several guys, sometimes several in the same episode.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that is essentially the entire story.\\n\r\nThere is no more meaning to this, just like that crisp packet filled with horse dung.\\n\r\nThere is a half-baked \"plot twist\" near the end, but it's hardly a twist, and doesn't do anything for the general story of this anime. It's still just a various selection of the men there finding new ways to invade her personal space.\\n\\n\r\nAdmittedly the art is very pretty. If you're anything like me, you saw the pretty boys and decided to watch it. After all, who doesn't like fairly handsome anime guys with gradient hair?\\n\\n\r\nThese guys are just dickwads.\\n\r\nFull stop.\\n\\n\r\nNo matter how \"aristocratic\" these guys are, their characters are terrible. There's a: \\n\r\n-sadist who likes stabbing potatoes\\n\r\n-the eventual \"lover\" of the MC who continuously tries to rape the aforementioned MC\\n\r\n-the angry guy\\n\r\n-an analyst who holds no purpose other than to give foreboding messages to the MC\\n\r\n-the guy who does literally nothing but sleep or bite people\\n\r\n-and the pervert who nicknames the MC as \"little bitch\" and gets angry when she doesn't do exactly what he wants\\n\\n\r\nThat is all the character you will get out of these guys.\\n\r\nNo, there is no character development.\\n\r\nYes, all of them are unbearable assholes.\\n\r\nNo, none of them have any depth whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nWell, you say, what about this \"Main Character\" you keep talking about?\\n\r\nYui, the female protagonist, has about as much spine as a banana and as much personality as one, too.\\n\r\nIf I'm going to be quite honest, she doesn't have a personality at all.\\n\r\nShe spends the entire series being borderline raped by a variety of different men, and apparently does not have the strength to kick any of them in the balls although I must say that pretty much all of them deserved it.\\n\\n\r\nEssentially all of these characters were wastes of fairly decent voice actors. Even if you decide not to look at the picture to prevent the loss of brain cells through overexposure to this, the admittedly attractive sounding voices are accompanied with awkward sucking noises like they don't understand the concept of drinking. The background music was mediocre at best, and I don't remember a single piece that held any special significance.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime is only fit for either masochists or if you want to kill all your brain cells. It can also be used as a post-war urban torture practice if you need to get revenge on someone you truly hate.\\n\\n",

It's a reverse harem with decent charecter design (visually not the personalitys at all) so if your looking for one of those with bad boys so badthey might rape you then this should still be pretty low on your priorities. watching this is really scraping the bottom of the barrel, and with a 12 minute run time it never even had a chance.",

            "content": "*Spoiler free*\r\nFrom the start let's address the elephant in the room. Or why I won't give this a low score just because it's misogynistic(and yes it hell of is). Anime is art and the purpose of art is not to show us only pretty things we would like to see(duh...!). Handling aside I respect it for tackling such a taboo theme. I mean no one is trashing \"12 Years a Slave\" for displaying slavery so why trash this purely on the fact that it's misogynistic. So I will not score it 1 or 2 just because I dislike one of the main themes.\r\nPremise, Plot\r\nThe premiseof the story is solid. We have a religious girl, churches, vampires and endless points of conflict. It's a pity that the solid base was wasted on a placeholder plot that was a pathetic cover for vampires bloodsucking a girl. And don't get me started on what's the bloodsucking a placeholder for. The whole thing was done in a retarded manner that was just wasteful.\\n\r\nPacing\\n\r\nWell it's bad. From the start we have a different vampire \"bloodsucking\" the girl every episode. Then someone had the revelation that they needed an ending so they created one from there arses.\\n\r\nComplexity and Catharsis\\n\r\nThe complexity is nonexistent, but then again you don't watch this anime for complexity. As for catharsis I was annoyed enough to write a review so.... some(I guess).\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\r\nFrom the disappointing plot they actually got something that they can use in the future, but from it being a standalone it's again bad. Almost nothing changed in anyway for the heroine and the rest of the characters continued like - \"well that happened blah,blah.....\".\\n\\n\r\nCharacters \\n\r\nOk we have the main heroine Yui Komori and the vampires. Why vampires and not names? Well they barely have the personalities of secondary characters. They are stereotypical with everyone having different traits. And they are...\\n\r\n1. The I am so cool and aloof.\\n\r\n2. The smart I'll do everything type.\\n\r\n3.The possessive and aggressive one.\\n\r\n4.The retarded.\\n\r\n5.The playboy.\\n\r\n6.The only possibly good one as a character,at least for me, so I won't spoil him.\\n\r\nThe antagonists thrown in there for the flimsy plot are not worth mentioning.\\n\r\nAnd here is our heroine Yui. Now I will allow myself to make a comparison. Think of Fantine from Les Miserables turn her character around in the worse possible manner and you got Yui. She is brain dead and I mean really it's wow. She could be seen as a masochist if you have a kind look on her character, but no..... she is just a really weak character that is there to be the object for the rape like scenarios.\\n\r\nAs a whole the characters are horribly inconsistent. They behave against all reason established by their character which they cling to(exept Yui the poor bird is just stupid). Also there is virtually no development. At least the backdrop was sort of not terrible on the grand scheme of things.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound\\n\r\nThe art I loved. It is positively gorgeous. If only the anime was as good as it's visuals. The whole theme created by the art was what I wanted the anime to be. The sound wasn't bad, I found a bit unmemorable. The opening was alright and the ending was good.The bite sound was annoying as hell.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Recommendation\\n\r\nI am giving it the benefit of the doubt that in the future it will get better and this whole season was just a character intro(I hope it is).\\n\r\nDid I enjoy it? Parts of it no matter how small they were.\\n\r\nWould I recommend it? . As anime it's bad like really bad one of the worse I have seen. Yet it tackles(even if in a horrible manner) taboo themes which you do not see everyday. I mean I watched the whole thing so it has to have some redeeming qualities like the art and it's really short too. \\n\r\nAs for recommending it, it's a resounding NO. There are definitely better things to watch and do, but at the end you decide.\\n",

It's maybe something that looks like it, but it isn't, they don't go that far you know!\r\nStory 8/10\r\nThe story is about a girl who ends up in a house with vampires. And, in contrast to other animes, they're not so nice to her. She is told that if she leaves the house she will bekilled. She also can't contact anyone, every phone she uses, is dead. Well, the boys are vampires so they suck her blood (How suprising -.-)\\n\r\nLater in the episodes there is some kind of an 'interesting' story, but you will see it for yourself :)\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\r\nThe art reminded me kind of of the anime Amnesia, where the art was great!\\n\r\nBut in Amnesia was it just a little bit better :)\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\r\nAgain, I don't really think the music is something that I listen to on purpose, so I wouldn't really know, I think it fitted quite well, because I wasn't irritated about it :) Then again, why an 8? Well, I liked the opening!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10\\n\r\nSome people would totally disagree with me that the persons in the anime have an own character, but they do have one.\\n\r\nYui:she just lets everything happen to her, but she well, she does actually resist, but she's just to weak :) but she doesn't actually have a very strong personnallity.\\n\r\nWell, I won't tell to much, but I liked Ayato and Subaru the most, and I thought that Kanato sometimes just, pretty creepy was...\\n\r\nWhat I have to say is that, when you think one of them is kind, you're mistaken, none of them is really kind, but I think they have something inside them, somewhere that is nice (you can see it a bit in Ayato and Subaru, maybe that's why I like them). And, for some of them, you can also see that their past has a bit of influence in their life, how they became.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10\\n\r\nWell, enjoy? She gets bitten a lot, I don't know how much I enjoyed that (It didn't really bother, but I didn't think it was the best in the anime) but it was enough to make me keep watching. I can tell that the 'story' in this anime actually starts around episode 7 (or somewhere around that).\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\r\nMaybe I should make a 7,5 of this.. It was a good one, but the ending... I expected more of it. Especially the last sentence that Yui said, I was like, really? seriously? Come on! I could have been better but maybe I was just expecting something that just wasn't there. And I wanted to know more about the characters, about their life. I thought it just needed something more.. not that I mean it was THAT bad. It's just the different kind of view from what you expect :)\\n\\n\r\nI hope this review helped you so you will watch it!\\n\\n\\n",

Like WTF! I have friends that like this show, possibly the reason is because of the sexy anime characters. That's it.

            "content": "Diabolik Lovers is a very controversial anime, and most people either love it or hate it. I personally loved it, although this would be better as a hentai. The storyline was really bad, and it didn't really make sense and clashed with the other events in the story. This anime is primarily for girls, especially masochistic girls with fetishes for sadistic, vampiristic, fashionable bishounens. I have to admit, the blood sucking scenes were extremely sexy. The artwork was amazing, and each character had their one fashion and theme. One thing they did do well on regarding the plot is that it wasn't a cliche romancestory. None of the characters really fall in love with her all of the sudden. The brothers stay sadistic until the end, even though there is still some character development. The opening and music was done well too. Overall, the anime was really good, not for the plot, but for the artwork and sexy scenes.",

            "content": "This is one of the sexiest anime I've ever seen. I'll say right away who this anime is for, and who it is not. This anime is for hard core kinky people, who like contolling dynamics. If you're totally vanilla you probably won't like this, and may even be highly offended and horrified. However, if you're the kind of person who enjoys Master/slave dynamics, and stories like The Story of O, you will probably really like this.\r\nThe anime itself is an interesting take on the harem genre. Instead of the usual male protagonist, surrounded by girls, here you have a single girl, surrounded by predatorymale vampire brothers, all whom are competing somewhat sadistically to make her their lunch.\\n\\n\r\nShe's basically made into their slave, and as the plot unfolds, we get to find out why she is there, and what her connection is to all of this. If you like hardcore unequal power dynamics, this will really appeal to you. If you like guys who are jerks and who push you around, this will probably make you weak in the knees and a puddly little mess. And if you enjoy girls being helpless little slaves, you will really like this.\\n\\n\r\nDefinitely hard core as far as the plot is concerned. They push her around and take what they want from her. If you like that sort of thing, you will really like this. If that sort of thing horrifies you, or freaks you out, or offends you, you definitely should not watch this, as it will probably seem very disturbing to you.",

There is no story plot until episodes 10-12, which is ridiculous, since there is only 12 episodes in the first season. I watched this anime dubbed, and the voices were obnoxious. Yui's voice kind of makes me want to stab myself in the face, with a fork. \r\nI don't even want to mention all the moaning that happens in this anime; like seriously, I thought I was watching hentai for a moment. I kid you not, every time on of the vampires went to suck Yui's blood, shemoaned like there was no tomorrow, and they made weird uncomfortable sucking noises. And don't even get me started on the music quality. Whenever music played, it was so loud you couldn't hear what anyone was saying. \\n\\n\\n\r\nNow, if you are interested in a anime that has abusive men all attracted to one girl, and the only thing that remotely makes it better (and yet still doesn't) is the fact that they are vampires, then this is the anime for you! Seriously, every episode there are at least 4 vampires sucking her blood. I don't know how she is not anemic by the second episode. Seriously. Not to mention the vampire anime cliche, 'the protagonist has delicious blood' which makes me want to hurt myself every time. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAnything else I should add? Oh yeah! Ever heard of Vampire Knight? It's decent right? Have you ever seen the dubbed version? If not, then you won't understand the point I'm about to make: Yui's voice is even more annoying then that of the main girl in Vampire Knight. And her voice was bloody awful. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSorry for the review being so long. I hope this helps anyone. I wouldn't say that I absolutely hated the anime, but I definitely won't be watching it again anytime soon.",

The story is captivating, seamless, and has no plot holes or brain raping confusing points or turns.  The stunning consistency in the animation is something to behold, there are no awkward cuts or frames, and all 12 of the Principals were strictly followed. The superb audio is pleasing to the ears, not just mine, but my family's and my neighbors as well, whenever I rewatch this masterpiece I make sure it's on a large TV for everyone to see, I as well as turn thevolume up so loud that the stuffing from my body pillow explodes. And the characters, mon dieu! Yui is intelligent and makes the best possible decisions given her situation, she is by far one of the greatest protagonists ever animated! Ayato is a sweet selfless boy, Laito is Jesus, Kanato is the most adorable floof, I desperately want them to tripple-bang me in all possible holes, and I could go about the others, but I shan't. The enjoyment I got from this show is through the roof, my poor poor ovaries came shooting out of my panocha in a cummy, bloody firework at 11:23 in episode 4. Overall this is the greatest anime- no, show to grace this earth. All members of the family 8-80, feminist relatives, and colleagues will all enjoy this little gem!",

And you learn about her vampire dominants and their dark story. Its bite upon bite upon bite in an endless series with some story chiped in cause they needed to let it look like an anime. So what i mean that the story is interesting is that the consepts they have were great the way they did it was appalling.\\n\\n\r\nWhat i liked the best about this anime was the artwork. The way the eyes are showed in particular makes every character have great ones. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is typical gothing vampire. Nothing to write home about. \\n\\n\r\nKomori, Yui or the main main as i like to call characters who are the real main ones. She is naive , at times stupid but with an overly kind personality that comes from her being brought up in a church. Problem i have with her is that its basically bend over and take it from every vampire guy which prob makes alot of girls maybe even guys have nosebleed but i find it boring when someone is that submissive. In her case she have to be like that but i blame the creators for making such bad character development. \\n\\n\r\nI wont write about every guy but i bet there is atleast one that will make a girl or guy drop and make her love that vampire there since their personality are all over the place. 1 has footfetish , one has a hand fetish while most of them bites her neck. \\n\\n\r\nDid i enjoy this eh yes and no. I thought the beginning looked nice until i got deeper in and it got boring and uninteresting. And there were some bits and pieces i liked later. \\n\\n\r\nOverall i could have given this a 2 if i wanted but i leaned more toward 3 cause the animation is going to get its credit due. If you like seeing a blond naive girl getting dominated and sucked dry by good looking vampires this is definitive the anime for you.  But if you thought this anime was dark and filled with good story then stay away from this cause there is only some interesting stories and it would be better to just scim through the anime if you want the story. its basically 8 minutes of them dominating her through sucking her dry and 2 minutes of some sort of story coming through. I mean i know its based on a otome game but couldnt they used some creative freedom and made an anime that wasnt an endless repition of the same thing over and over and over again.",

            "content": "Thank god I finally get to do a review of this AWFUL, DISAPOINTING ANIME!\r\nPlease read reviews before wasting your time on this anime.\r\nI always say that if the main character isn't likeable then there's little hope in the anime. Sometimes that's not true but Ima stick with it. The main character of Diabolik Lovers is a weak, whiny, naive, pathetic, boring, plain, brainless girl who has absoulutly no character whatsoever. I KNOW WHY THOUGH! Animes that are based off of harem otome games usually will have a plain main character since in the game the main characters personality are based on the players choice. Anywaysthis characters will make you scream and wish for her to be dead quickly.\\n\\n\r\nThe male vampire brothers just suck her blood... that's all they're there for. Each of them are suppose to be brothers with very different personalities and once you learn their oh so tragic past you're meant to feel sympathy for them. After all the things they've done though I couldn't care less. \\n\\n\r\nI get it. The art style is great, amazing. However, that is the only good thing about that. ONLYYYY!!!!  \\n\\n\r\nI hear a lot of people say that \"Ohhh you shouldn't judge it unless you've played the game which is 10x better and has more story! You'll understand thennnn!\" \\n\\n\r\nNOPE, NOPE! We don't care about the game! We care about the anime. Also stop trying to say the vampires are that way because of their past. That may be true but I'm past of the point of caring bout them.\\n\\n\r\nStory was all over the place and only gets mentioned a few times but disapears constantly until it rolls around in the last few episodes. They didn't seem to care about the plot too much and just cared about the blood sucking, trying to squeeze the plot in places.\\n\\n\r\nABOUT THE BLOOD SUCKING. It's uncomfortable and the main character doesn't fight back even if they're hurting her or torturing her. She even gets a weapon to kill them but nahhhhhhh! She's a masochist but if you like that then heyyyy waste your time watching the anime! \\n\\n\r\nSeveral scences to me just scream 'rape!'. It's uncomfortable and you'll want to turn away. Unless you're totally into uncomfortable blood sucking scences.",

            "content": "Okay this anime is so controversial it also haunts me because it could have been so good but it just hurts too much to be good. Let me explain something Diabolik lovers is based on the game series Diabolik lovers, I watched this anime many time and most of you will wonder why. Because this anime makes a hilarious drinking game to play with your friends if your bored and the show is also hilariously bad. So I decided to review this now even though I have first seen the show like in 2015, I am playing the games now, While the games aren't thegreatest either they are a lot better in the show because in the ending of each dating route in the game you actually get rewarded for all the abuse you take lol. But in the show it doesn't/ can't do that because there is no canon male character who Yui picks because its up to the player. Also in the show Yui sucks as a character, they all do but in the game you understand her and the male characters a bit more. But I am reviewing the anime not the game. Anyway....\\n\r\nStory 5/10\\n\r\nWell the story make a little bit of sense in the anime they just did a terrible job at adapting from the game and it sucks... no pun intended lol, \\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\nOkay wait before you go WTF, I am sorry but the colors and character designs in this anime are really pretty and I liked them, so that is literally the only good part about this whole train wreck.\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\r\nI liked the bgms and op/ed the character songs are good. But nothing stands out too much \\n\r\nCharacter 4/10\\n\r\nAGHHHH god they all suck.... Seriously why do they have to be so abusive.... It's so annoying, also Yui do more to help yourself. But in all honesty I don't think Yui actually wants to escape and that's why she does nothing she is more interesting in the game actually everything is more interesting in the game. Also the anime lacks the characterization that the game gives these crappy characters even though the majority of them are still bad.\\n\r\nEnjoyment 5/10\\n\r\nThe game is better... But i guess I like vampires so I enjoyed the show in that aspect but the show is so punishing...\\n\r\nOverall 5/10\\n\r\nJust play the game even though the game is still torture at least it rewards you",

See the thrill, when all these under-nourished emos stalk and abuse this dumbass-in-distress, sucking her dry and calling her a nicknames, that even a ten-year-old would snear at! Wait for the epic twist of stupidious proportions, and let your inner feminist cry out loud in protest... or, if you're at all like me, in protest for a lack of any decent vampire-smut!\\n\\n\r\nThis anime, to me, seem to be some sort of, eary yet beautifully dark version, of Amnesia... wich it actually was, since the art and music are the only good sellingpoints, and the main heroine is this whining and sniveling twat-in-distress, who isn't as bad as the twat from Amnesia, since she can't talk, and this twat can - mostly just cries, whines and \"please!\", \"stop\", and so on, but still! The harem in this version, is actually downright disgusting, since they're all just some sadistic, abusive, sosiopathic a-holes, with no actual personalities, other than being these overly twisted dominatrix-es, ready to play with their new 'Little Bitch', with their pointy, dirty teeht!\\n\\n\r\nThis anime made me sick! Not kinda the way, like Gantz, or Elfen Lied, or School Days makes other people sick, but actually making me hate, that I was born to a girl! I hated being a girl, simply by looking at this twat, being so utterly helpless, and clueless... even if she's given all the weapons, and reasons to either protect herself, or just leave the fuck out this fucktown of loonies, and laugh while doing so! Seariously... kill these fuckers, and be done with it - you have the knive, for crying out loud! Use it! And the vampire-emos get no credit from me either! Not one of them is actually hot, likable, or someone, who I'd like to submit myself to, let him talk crazy possessive shit into my face - \"I own you\", \"You are mine\", \"You're blood's so sweet\", \"I love your fear\" - and later on, form some sort of one-sided Stockholm syndrome to... like this twat does! Shit... she lets these guys to bite and violate her - both physically, and mentally - so many times, in a row, that I wonder, how sore her neck must be like, after every single episode! And she has this knive... all this time! I kept just repeating with myself, while watching this, that if I was in this situation, and some bony smerky-ass bitch was calling me by these names, and sucking my blood, like some sort of jummy juice out of a vender, I would kick him in a nuts, and stab him, with this plot-knive, that I got, right for this kind of situations! She's the most stupid, needlesly submissive, and masochistic heroine, that I've seen in a while... and I can't even remember her name! That's how memorable she is!\\n\\n\r\nWhat I can thank this anime of, is that it's actually mercifully short, and even less than 15 minutes per episode! This little series offers absolutely nothing to those, who have seen some really good vampire stuff, and even less for those, who are just looking for some nice, and little bit crazy/dirty romance, between this helpless, submissive Stocholm-twat, and some ridiculously insane and sadistic/posessive vampire-boylolies! Stay away from this anime! It's not worth your time, and it's not any fun to watch... expecially, if you're a girl, and know your worth! This anime gave me literaly nothing, and instead, made me just angry, disgusted, and hate both my gender, and the opposite, so... yeah. Not good! Not... good!\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nCharacters: 3\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2\\n\r\nOverall: 2",

            "content": "The only major drawback to this series is the fact that the intended audience is rather small. The original Drama CDs (which inspired the visual novel then this) were targeted towards masochistic women in Japan. Now, keeping that in mind while watching the series, it definitely explains the 'rape-y' vibe (which I have noticed appears in more than a few of the reviews, despite no actual sexual intercourse in the slightest). So be weary when you go to watch the show; If you're not part of that select group of people then this is most certainly not the show for you. Moving on wards, theart choice for the series as well as the animation are both absolutely stunning and are, at the very least, worth checking out even if you're not into the show or concept. The overall story for the season was honestly drawn out and there wasn't much of it in the beginning episodes, however, it started to pick up towards the middle and end it made it somewhat worth it. The characters on the other end were all sadistic (which makes sense given the target audience) however, they were all sadistic in very similar ways and between them there wasn't much variety (with the exception of a few instances, but I digress).",

The protagonist Yui Komori is sent by her father to the Sakamakis. These have a large estate, where Yui is sent by her driver. With their luggage in hand, she goes to the front door, where a large door knocker is. But nobody responds as to her knock, they just want to knock again, when suddenly the door swings open of its own accord. Somewhat surprised she enters, looking for a person. When she umguckt located in theentrance hall, she suddenly sees a young man with red hair lying on the sofa. She speaks to him, but he does not respond. Fearing she feels his pulse and his heart, but it does not stop his heart. You just want to call with your cell phone an ambulance, because it is her torn suddenly from the boy out of his hand. Full aghast she is surprised by the young vampire and almost bitten, but suddenly appears another boy on. He has gray hair and looks older. Yui recognize their chance and runs up to him and begs him to help her. He asks what she has lost at all here. Then he rounds up his brothers and clear them all. Finally comes herraus that Yui henceforth shall dwell with the Sakamakis. I particularly liked the story and the characters, there was nothing wrong. All in one: A very good vampire anime!",

            "content": "When an anime is based on a Visual Novel it's very hard to put all of the different routes into one anime. Normally, when an anime is based off a Visual Novel they tend to be lacking what other anime have due to limitations on the story or they just end out being plain bad. It is extremely hard to portray the character's personalities and emotions when it's based off such a limited resource. Because these types of anime are so hard to pull off, there are rare circumstances where if it's done correctly, the anime will be extremely satisfying. Unfortunately, with Diabolik Lovers, thiswasn't the case.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3 \\n\r\nFor some unknown reason, I feel bad giving Diabolik Lovers' story a rank of poor. Throughout the anime, I kept giving it chances to get better and so I kept watching. Sadly, it didn't. For me, the story would've been a lot better if they went about it in a different way. I feel that I kept giving it some slack because it was based off a Visual Novel but now that I've finished both the OVA and the anime, I am forced to give Diabolik Lovers a bad review.\\n\r\nWithout spoiling anything, the story is about a girl who moves into a new home after being sent there by her Father. Little did she know that this rather large mansion was a home to vampires craving fresh blood. The six vampires that she's now living with want to claim her as theirs. They abuse her like a slave, they don't treat her as a person and they take her blood whenever they desire. Really, she's just a poor sacrifice. Because of certain reasons, she cannot leave the home. I cannot write much more incase you do indeed wish to watch this anime but I can say for sure that the story isn't good. Although I rant about the story, I can't say that I didn't enjoy it a little.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nThe art could be better. For the type of anime it is, the shoujo art style was a good choice. I would've given it a higher rank if it wasn't for the fact that some of the backgrounds look like they've been taken out of a book and pasted into the anime. I am not sure as to weather or not this was intended but for me, this sometimes became an eye sore. Other than that, the art was average for the time that Diabolik Lovers aired. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nNo soundtrack really stood out to me in Diabolik Lovers. Because of this reason, I gave it a fair score. The sound wasn't bad, but it wasn't striking either. The only problem with the sound that I had was the blood sucking sound effects and the ending song. Much dramatic ending. Such wow.\\n\r\nI'm not even joking, it's just dramatic battle-like music with credits.\\n\r\n(\u256f\u00b0\u25a1\u00b0\uff09\u256f\ufe35 \u253b\u2501\u253b I can't even...\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\r\nThe character development was fair. It wasn't good enough to get me overly attached like most anime (because I am a typical fangirl) but at the same time I was attached to them in some way. I would've definitely cried if one of them were to die. The problem with this anime is the problem that most reverse harem anime have: too many characters to develop. This anime focuses on the characters around the female protagonist (Yui) like it should since Yui has no real importance. But, since there are over six characters surrounding Yui and such short episodes, they have to equal out the development. In these types of anime, if one character is more developed than the other, they're most likely going to get the female in the end and so, reverse harem makers watch out for this. I had no real problems with the characters if you exclude the occasional rude tongue. For this reason alone, I wont give the characters a poor rank. \\n\r\nThey could've been better.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3 \\n\r\nI found this anime quite insulting at some times so that took out some enjoyment for me. The ending was a bit too dramatic for me and I found myself having to force myself to finish the last few episodes. At times I did enjoy the anime but at others I didn't.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3\\n\r\nDiabolik Lovers was a bad anime. Some could argue with me but in the end of the day, this type of anime, as I've said before is extremely hard to pull off. The stupid story combined with the overly dramatic situations made this anime seem worse than it was. Diabolik Lovers wasn't entirely bad, but it wasn't good. I myself wouldn't recommend Diabolik Lovers to everyone but if you're into vampires and abuse then go ahead.",

Its another one of those otomate games adapted into an anime.  12 roughly 15m long episodes.  \r\nI think where all the negatively and let downs are coming from are really due to expectations in the wrong direction. if you take a step back it originated from a dating game. a dating game that put the player into a harlem.  much like real life dating; people have different taste in their relationships.  this is directed at the individuals that enjoy masochism.  \r\nwith that laid outthe anime served its purpose. it gave masochistic anime fan girls/boys a sequel and was entertaining.  \\n\r\nThe story line was decent a bit floppy, but there weren't holes.  the animation was stunning, with a nice steam punk/visual kei/ Victorian look. movement wasn't awkward, picture frames were consistent. I quite enjoyed the sound, the voices actors were perfect along with the other background noises.  There was character development not a lot but it was there, a lot of good strong character in attitude and appearance, all the typical lover boy types were thrown in ie. lazy, smart, shota, self-loathing, and the egotistical in your face.\\n\r\noverall if youre not into masochism youre not going to enjoy this anime, you'll probably be repulsed.  on the flip side if you do, you'll quite enjoy it, and carry on (:",

            "content": "Many people will say Diabolik Lovers is a waste of time but everyone has there own opinions and mine is that I really really really loved this anime. Yes I understand that Yui Komori is being sexually harassed but all the guys and they can be a little odd at sometimes but having a twist like this and not the typical \u00a8Twilight\u00a8 stuff is a new change. Through out the season we get to learn stuff about each character and there background. There are many people out there who doesn't like that this girl is treated this way but all of us just really needto remember that this is just made up, and that the only real sexually parts to this is when there \u00a8feeding\u00a8 on her. The main characters are vampires to point out and they aren't real so no one needs to worry about seeing a girl out in reality sucking someones blood. The art is very impressive in these series and I really enjoyed on how much detail they put into each scene. Which isn't even that graphic. All you see mainly is one of the guys biting her, and maybe a little blood once in a while. But that mainly it to the \u00a8gross parts\u00a8 The plot is something I would have not suspected and that's just what wanted me to keep watching and waiting for what would happen next, and I can't wait until they make the second season. The characters are very well laid out there personalities are all different, and they all have different looks. At the end of the last episode I didn't quite like it because they leave us off on a cliffhanger, but don't worry if you decide to watch this amazing piece of artwork season 2 will probably answer our undying questions. I do truly hope you will give this a go even if it may seem something you don't watch just give it another try. \\n\r\nThanks for reading my review!!\\n",

At this point the only littleinformation you get from them, is that they had 3 different mothers, they killed\\n\\n\r\nNo real story-line or plot it all reveals at until the last 3 episodes, but that point, your brain cells are death. The whole 12 episodes, you see that the Protagonist is just a DUMB blond girl that was sent to a mansion full of vampire not knowing why, she's only there for the Vampire to suck her blood at least FIVE times in each episode, without somehow not dying. I kept watching hopping that at least one episode she would I don't know maybe have some mystical power or least stand up for herself in mid way of the series, but instead just gets her blood suck. From neck, arms, LEG, and shoulders, one of the Vampire brothers actually calls her *little bitch* and yet she doesn't do anything..  or try to make a stand in each episode she tries to talk to the brothers hoping she would i guess help them? oh something, but not she just gets her blood suck again. The only thing she able to do, is say STOP while she's moaning, by now she would realize that doesn't help her at all.\\n\\n\r\nThis obviously a Rated R series for the whole Blood Sucking Sexual Content, that they'd on her... And that really bad insults.\\n\\n\r\nIn other words, it isn't good... Hopefully this helped",

            "content": "Okay, so here's the warning for this anime. There are 2 sides; you either LOVE it, or you hate it. \r\nMost of the other reviews depict this as an immoral and sick anime, but if reverse harem and sadists are you thing, then you'll enjoy this thoroughly. \r\nStory (6/10): Not the best story, but the flash backs are pretty interesting as you move on later in the anime. Basically, this girl's father goes overseas so she's sent to live with her \"distant relatives\" who are vampires. She has to fit to their schedule and attends night school. Literally each vampire gets their turn to suckher blood, but she still cares about them in the next episode (I don't even know... she's stupid) \\n\r\nArt (10/10): I don't know how else to say this but the art is really beautiful. The characters are well-drawn and the background is very spooky and fits the anime well.\\n\r\nSound (9/10): I really like the soundtrack and voice acting for this anime. The intro song is really spooky and eerie, which suits well with the plot and concept off the anime, and the voices sound as the characters looks (innocent, arrogant, strict, etc.)\\n\r\nCharacter (9/10): I rated this as a 9 because really, the characters fit the concept of this anime. The vampires are sadists because something horrible happened in their past, it's understandable. But what I find unsual is that the girl is so freaking stupid. Even if she's a girl, it's not like can't comprehend who is a bad guy...\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10): I enjoyed this anime. It is something like a drama/ecchi/thriller so if you're into those then you should watch it.\\n\r\nOverall (9/10): this anime, despite the bad reviews has its good qualities as well. But anything, whether its anime, movies, or dramas, people really have different opinions. You shouldn't always rely on reviews to interpret whether something is good or not. So basically, you really just have to watch this anime yourself ^-^\\n",

The answer became very clearly within 15 minutes (a.k.a the first episode).\r\nI was immediately greeted by the main female protagonist (Yui), who soon became more hated than Bella Swan in my mind, with her whiny and irritating personality, and her persistence in running away, falling over, and turning her neck to the brothers to drink from her, regardless that she is 'trying to resist'. \r\nThen along came the immortal brothers who drove the storyline of draining Yui's blood, all limited in theirrange of emotions  yet endless in their creepiness. I was so glad that each episode was 15 minutes long, as I could get it all over and done with as soon as possible.\\n\\n\r\nThough the characters made the storyline (or lack of storyline) close to insufferable, one of my key motivations to keep watching was to see if/when Yui dies. Hopefully I'll be luckier with the second season, due to my slight interest on how things unfolded in the last episode.",

            "content": "Did you know that this show was getting another season? I didn't. I mean, I read on MAL that there was a 'sequel' show to Diabolik Lovers entitled 'Diabolik Lovers More,Blood', but I didn't believe what I was looking at (the comma in your second season title is one word too late by the way fellas). I went back to the page multiple times, and eventually realised 'oh, this actually exists.' The fact that a show this atrocious can get a sequel clearly demonstrates how pathetic this industry is, and that really hurts me to say. Now that I check again, apparently it's already startedairing and has finished! Bloody hell. Anyway, let's tackle this beast of a show... and I don't say that in a good way. \\n\\n\r\nAlright, well, this is probably one of the worst shows I've ever watched; just thought I'd get that out there immediately in case you didn't know my view on this. I'm very pleased that everyone else seems to realise how poor this show's quality is, otherwise I'd probably have to press the eject button on my 'anime fan' seat and get out of this community as fast as possible. \\n\\n\r\nWhat drew me to this show initially was the art, which is what usually gets me watching a show in the first place. The art of this show is surprisingly (given how horrendous everything else is), very good; phenomenal in fact. I was particularly drawn to the eye design of the characters, which is something I can always appreciate when it comes to anime art. \\n\\n\r\nEven the concept of the show, 'a family of attractive vampiric brothers sharing a living space with a young girl', was something that took my interest. I wasn't sure what to expect, but I sure as hell wasn't expecting this blowout. \\n\\n\r\nThe main character of this show, Yui Komori, despite being quite attractive, is unfortunately somewhat mentally dull. I would hazard a guess that she's missing some key thought- processes, in fact. The way in which her character interacts with the rest of the show's characters is just vacant, and very uninspiring. You feel that there is no dynamic to this girl's reactions to her surroundings, and the reason you think this is because you're dead right; she's probably the most boring character in the entire show, and that's seriously saying something. \\n\\n\r\nDiabolik Neck Biting should be the name of this show, because there are no 'lovers' present; this is merely a 'story' (I say story very loosely) about a girl running away from a group of adolescents and young men trying to bite her for sexual pleasure. While there may be a few scenes here and there giving the illusion of a 'story' existing in the show besides that of said neck biting, the actual, real 'story' is about a girl who serves no purpose in this anime other than to have her neck bitten repeatedly. I'm talking, at least 5 neck biting scenes per episode, and there can be as many as 3 or 4 different people biting her in the one episode. The entire synopsis of this show should be changed to the following: 'Girl enters house and finds herself in an endlessly repeating cycle of vampiric rape'. \\n\\n\r\nJust when you think the supposed 'story' that the show is trying its very best to tell is actually creating some kind of valid background to the whole situation, the neck biting makes a dramatic return, and reminds you why you're actually watching the show, or at the very least, the only reason why anyone would want watch the show. Who would actually want to watch it knowing how bad it is? I have no clue. I really don't think that someone with a cannibalism fetish, a blood fetish, or just a biting fetish would find this pathetic excuse of a show to be 'entertaining', or even arousing! It's difficult for me to even describe the execution of these neck biting scenes, because it feels like, as I have said, this neck biting deal is the whole entire point of this show. It gets repetitive by around episode 2/3, and this continues for the entire show. It's so pointless that it leaves me stunned for words.\\n\\n\r\nThere are no 'lovers' to be seen, but the quality of the show's episodes is diabolically horrendous, so I suppose the anime's name does have some relevance to what's happening in the show. I would really liken this show to your average H-Anime like so: \\n\r\nH-Anime - Possesses a weak story that is not designed to interest anyone, but rather exists to create a context for the sex scenes that serve as the true purpose of the show. \\n\r\nDiabolik Lovers - Possesses a weak story that is not designed to interest anyone, but rather exists to create a context for the neck biting scenes that serve as the true purpose of the show. \\n\\n\r\nDiabolik Lovers, long story short, had a much better life ahead of it in the H-Anime world. Except, this show has close to zero nudity. It fails as an H-Anime, despite having all of the prerequisites save for the show's rating, and also fails as a normal anime. Completely. I will repeat this again: \\n\\n\r\nThe only positive aspect to this show is the art. Diabolik Lovers has some of my favourite anime art, yet it's one of the worst shows I have ever watched. That's a real shame, because the potential was there for something good to exist here, but it was thrown head first out the door to pander to a seemingly brain- dead demographic who value 50 neck biting scenes across 12 episodes over a legitimate story- related purpose. Fine if they're dedicated sex scenes, and the anime's rating is Rx, but not fine if it's an R - 17 anime that's not even allowed to show nudity. \\n\\n\r\nExcluding the art, this show is up there as one of the most astounding anime failures I have ever had the displeasure of watching, and quite frankly, I don't know when I'll get around to watching the second season. If it's more of the same, I'll probably drop it before the second episode, because I honestly have better things to do with my time. In fact, I think any person who has any value in their lives whatsoever would be able to find something more productive to do with their time than watching this series. \\n\\n\r\nDo not watch this show, even if you like Vampires. You will never want to watch another erotic vampiric biting scene again in your entire life, and your whole perception of what makes a vampire 'cool' will be annihilated for all eternity, if Twilight hasn't already done so. Please take yourself over to Hellsing Ultimate and give this show a miss; at least Hellsing Ultimate has a sex scene, and that was an INTERESTING show! Just forget you ever heard about Diabolik Lovers; I honestly wish I could forget.",

Once she gets there she sees this guy sleeping on the couch and she checks his pulse. His heart wasn't beating so of course she was freaking out and he wakes up. Soon she figures out he's a vampire and that he's not the only one in the house. There are about 6 (i forgot)other vampires in the house with him. \\n\\n\r\nThe Art: I loved the art I gave it a 9 because it's pretty good in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nThe Sound: Eh I don't pay attention to the sound because I watch subbed usually so I don't really care about the sound.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters: Omg the vampires are SO abusive to the girl. They gave her nicknames and One of them was \"Little B****\"  and another one was \"Breast less.\" So they're pretty harsh. The girl (Yui) Is so nice but constantly gets abused by these vampires which make me very annoyed. I mean I thought the guys were pretty hot but still I want to just go in the anime and brutally murder the vampires because they're just so abusive.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I didn't enjoy the anime. Period. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: This anime is just vampires that keep making the girl feel discouraged and keep biting her.\\n\\n",

I like several of the anime's out there and I'll tell you what, I would watch Diabolik Lover again and again because I liked it. Now if any of you out there have watched Black Blood Brothers, well I gotta tellyou one of the characters looks an awful lot like ayato. I also hope they bring out another season of this. I also wish someone would talk to some of the old anime makers and have them add seasons to some of the current anime's out there. For instance, Vampire Knight needs a season 3 and 4, Black Blood Brothers needs a season 2 they left it without a conclusion, Vandread could have gone past season 2 I would love to see if both sides made it together, Demon King Daimao could have had another season, and also Dance in the Vampire Bund.",

The colors used served well to create a creepy and mysterious atmosphere. Each character was painstakingly drawnto have his own attitude and quite honestly was probably the only real personality these poor characters had. Suffice it say that my problem does not lie with the animation itself but with the extremely poor writing.\\n\\n\r\n   The characters are extremely boring and  nauseatingly unbelievable. It felt like I was watching some weird twisted mixture of 50 Shades of Grey and Twilight. The entire anime is just a long drawn out fang rape fantasy shoddily held together by an extremely poor story-line. It constantly hints as you go that there is something more to it than what you are being given only to let you down time and time again all the way to the easily predicted ending. I would not even recommend this anime to people who just want to watch anything that might sate their fang fetish.",

Most of the negativity is coming from the \"mature\" content. If you like a little darker anime then this is for you. The art was pleasant, very soft and easy on the eyes. It had humor,  but wasn't full of all the fluff that you normally see in this genera.( I'd watch OHSC if you wanted that) I'm a big fame of Otome games and enjoy seeing how they produced it into an anime. Honestly I'd give this animea 9 overall why, because it kept me watching... It not's 100% predictable. I'd give it a 10, but the ending left me a little disappointed. Diabolik Lovers isn't for everyone, but its interesting and has a little more depth then most reverse harems.  I'd give it a go, if you aren't sensitive.",

Diabolik Lovers started off as Drama CDs back in late 2011 on wards, from then the CDs continued on into an otome game and trust me for someone who has played it... It is many times more disturbing than the anime. \r\nDiabolik Lovers the anime was created to be an advertisement anime, to make people become interested in the games and drama CDs (which it worked for me). The anime leaves out some really valuable points from the game whichis a shame, but I couldn't help but love the anime despite that. Even though the anime is short and doesn't give one the info they're looking for, you have to admit that the way the vampires are portrayed in this is really well done. Ever since Twilight came out, people had forgotten what vampires were capable of. Sorry for the people who love the lovey dovey vampires, but this anime shows exactly how vampires should behave around humans, especially since they're all boys and they have a young, Christian girl living with them, it's only natural that they would want to break her more than they have to any other girl. With anime like this, it's best to look at the deeper picture and analyze the characters more.\\n\\n\r\nBut for those who weren't satisfied with the anime either way, this is a good time for you all to play the games for yourself but be warned... there is a much higher level of abuse, there is rape (off screen), minor acts of cannibalism and hints of incest, the game really isn't for the typical fangirl at all. Those who can handle such stuff should be able to play it though\\n\r\nGood Luck ^w^",

Most of the episodes are just some guy nomming on Yui for the upteenth time. Like how can the main girl even run around afterwards? It baffles me.\r\nThe story is trying to get at that Yui was supposed to be at this home for just a little bit and realizes all the dudes are just stupid horn ball vampires :/ She was told she could leave but she was always derp and stayed -.- She doesn't fight them off either especially lateron. But I guess that's to happen since they're just gonna nom on her anyway? Anyways so they're using her to be this sacrificial bride and all that jazz.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe most intriguing. It had nice colors for characters and eyes were interesting. Though I want to yank down Ayato's pant leg, drove me nuts. Oh and it was off putting with the one guy's eye being visible in his hair. Just no.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nNothing too impressionable. Didn't hate or like it really.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nAll you need to know is their bloodthirsty horn balls and a pathetic heroine who doesn't even try to stop them?? Like she just gives in and deals with that b.s. And is apparently okay with these guys doing this stuff? Oh and to top it off all these vampires are all just like you're mine and gonna suck your blood. You're just my plaything. Then just abruptly at the end they actually like her? It was so forced -.-\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI actually enjoyed it in terms of humor. There was quite a bit to pick on for this anime. ^^;",

I gave it a 10 for enjoyment because I had fun watching it with my friend and then I re-watched it with some of my family and it was just as much fun again.\r\nWhy was it fun? Well, we had a blast making fun of all the characters! The main girl Yui is the typical reverse harem, air-head, female lead.  So, naturally she has no choice, but to be annoyingly submissive and make allthe wrong decisions. The 6 vampire brothers both verbally and physically abuse her and she just takes it! She is basically livestock to these edge-y jerks. That being said, there's a lot of odd blood-sucking scenes. At one point of of them sucks blood out of her thigh! WHYYYYY??? Just do what all the mainstream vampires do and go for the neck, brah! Staph with the wanna be Edge!\\n\\n\r\nAll the characters are very flat with no depth to them. All the brothers are creepy in there own way (Examples: one always basks in his own glory with headphones in, one doesn't know how to roll down his pant legs, and another has a weird thing for his teddy bear), but they are all always salty and all of them think that they are \"All that and a bag of chips\". I couldn't pick a favorite guy because they were all jerks. \\n\\n\r\nFlat characters also made a flat story. Things happen, we see a little \"sad\" (not really sad) back stories for all the brothers and Yui, but all in all it was lame.\\n\\n\r\nI gave the art an 8 because I liked the backgrounds, the characters' eyes, and the characters' hair, but that was pretty much the only quality from this show.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like Dance with Devils, this is basically the same thing. \\n",

            "content": "I feel like the anime was just some kind of promotion to the visual novels. I say go play those rather than watch the anime. Prepare for a long-ass review below (or, y'know, just skip to the last two paragraphs for final thoughts.)\r\nI'm not going to say the heroine was stupid, because it's beating a dead horse. Anime adaptions of Otomes have a propensity for having blank-slate heroines that seem slow or stupid because 1) a moderate amount of a heroine's personality (intellect included) is based on what path is taken in the game, and they just can't pick one or model herpersonality after a specific one because 2) they don't want to lean too much on one path and upset the many viewers who favored one of the other 5 (or 4; I didn't even think Kanato was an option.) So with that in mind, I don't really think anything of heroines in these types of anime because I know why they're like that. Now with that aside. \\n\\n\r\nYou don't really learn anything about the individual characters except if you count vague flashbacks. They only had 15 minutes a run, but I feel like they could have done something like add an extra episode around the time Yui was living the memories, but seeing as they didn't even really try, this led back to me thinking this was just a promotional thing. Like \"if you wanted to know more, you should go play that guy's path\", y'know?\\n\\n\r\nNone of them show any sign of actually thinking of the heroine as anything more than food, which was a bit hard to watch at times. I wasn't even looking to see romance after episode 5, just for one of them to be slightly nicer or friendlier or at least not treat the heroine like a rag. I know, BDSM and all that, but I can only deal when there's ONE sadist, but there were six of them, and the girl came off more like a victim than an M. Being vampire-themed there were a LOT of sexual undertones, and the guys ganging up on her at times and treating her poorly in the end could only come of as abuse (mental and sexual) to me.\\n\\n\r\nI'll admit: Subaru had me swooning for all of 2 minutes. (SPOILERS- SKIP TO \"SPOILERS END\" TO AVOID) He told her when to leave and gave her the knife when she didn't. But then he said what the knife was for, and I was a bit disappointed, and then I realized he wasn't really treating her like a person; it was more like setting a caged bird free. Still, I blushed at him saying \"I'll make you really feel my fangs.\" (SPOILERS END)\\n\\n\r\nThe art wasn't as great as the Visual Novel, or on par for that matter. The music was kinda contemporaneously generic, thought the opening kinda stuck to me. Don't expect the characters to be nice to Yui, our heroine, (as a matter of fact, trigger warning: if you have been sexually abused, don't watch) and don't get too worked up about her stupidity (refer to paragraph 1). This anime seems to be up the ally of a lot masochistic and sadistic people so some will like it many won't it wasn't really  for me. The plot was also  pretty spotty, so if you're one of those who (allegedly) watched for plot and not for hot guys (either way I'm not judging), you'll find yourself disappointed, as I was. \\n\\n\r\nAll that being said, the entire series is 180 minutes, and that's if you watch the recap episode. Might just be something to watch when you've expended all your other options. Yep. That about wraps that up.\\n\\n\r\n4/10\\n\\n",

            "content": "The only reason as to why I will grant the anime a petty 2 is due the artwork - and because of their choices regarding voice actors for the characters. \r\nOtherwise, the serie is actually pointless to the last bit. It promotes rape, and no - you can not deny this fact. 30 seconds into the story and the main character, being the girl (Yui), is pinned underneath some creepy casanova with red hair and a huge appetite for petite women with blood inside their veins. No thank you. I get the deal; they're vampires - oh yeah, they must starve for blood. But really?This was almost exceeding my limits. It DID exceed my limits, and as a member of the female gender, it was absolutely horrendous to watch how Yui was pushed around by the several male characters. It makes the viewer get a very bad view of her, since we only get to see her cry; and do absolutely nothing about the pests bothering her, other than her whimpering; ''no - stop!''. They even told Yui head-on that if she even as much as tried to escape, they would kill her. The males were complicated and downright unreasonable - disgusting.  It was painful to watch.\\n\\n\r\nIt may be appealing to people who may enjoy the blatant display sadism,  a horrid brother complex that will never be resolved and a sad, sad love story. As in;  VampiresxBlood. Ongoing ladyboner, excuse me. (Notice the sarcasm). \\n\\n\r\nI'm not sure what the creators wanted with this serie; there was absolutely no character development. It was almost too much to watch how it always ended up with Yui begging for them to stop harassing them, and further more, it was more of a contest for the males.... as in; who can scare and harass Yui the most - and in the process get a hunch of blood, too? How about no.\\n\\n\r\nSure, we did get a view of the character's background stories, but that didn't leave much information anyhow. It was just unfinished; too short - very grim altogether. \\n\\n\r\nI can at least tell you that I had fun watching it because of it ridiculousness. I didn't watch it myself, I admit - it was more of a erratic event for my friends and I, since we kind of ended up screeching together or laughing because of the circumstances throughout the serie. \\n\\n\r\nAbsolutely pointless otherwise.\\n",

            "content": "I have attempted to watch this anime twice. Both times, I have failed to get past episode 5.  This review will not be favourable to this show and likely will repeat points raised by other reviews. However my dislike for this shows means I have to have my say.\r\nFirstly, I shall start on what I consider the shows few positive aspects.\r\nArt: 5/10\r\nTo be fair, the animation quality is pretty good. It's not anything special but it's certainly the most appealing feature of this show. The environments certainly portray the dark, mysterious mansion well. Again it's nothing unusual for shoujo anime, but it's enjoyable enoughto look at.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nI didn't pay much attention to the overall sound design, nor did the performances generally stick with me. The voice acting is fine, although I give credits to the voice actress of the heroine. She did a great job - I just feel sorry she got stuck in this show.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 1/10\\n\r\nUnfortunately, otome adaptions of anime are either hit-or-miss. Whilst otomes usually have branching stories, various endings or routes; anime can't replicate this. I have never had the chance to play the original otome game for Diabolick Lovers, so this is purely judging the story of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the little of this anime I managed to survive, the story seemed like it was building up to a mystery (of sorts) about how all the characters were connected. However, this aspect kept being shoved aside in favour of the characters harassing the heroine. I wish they would bring these backstories to light sooner because the main 'plot' is virtually non-existent. Not that this anime cares about having a decent story - it needs the screen time for the heroine to be abused.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 1/10 (If I could give this 0, I would)\\n\r\nBy episode three, I hated every character within this show. The males are flat, uninspiring and seem to consist of the worst parts of every trope imaginable. Take the typical 'edgy, cool guy' look for anime, chuck in some gradients, add the worst traits possible for a guy to have - that's this cast.\\n\\n\r\nThey are all selfish, lazy and scheming, and make a point of acting as derogatory towards the heroine as possible. Literally, these characters do not care if the heroine is on the verge of DEATH - as long as they get to drink blood, they just toss her around like a rag doll. They abuse the heroine (mentally and physically), insult her almost every sentence and are about as likable as a pile of mud. Even that comment is insulting to mud. These are literally the worst, most unlikable characters I have ever had the displeasure to witness. I don't care if you just like them because their 'hot' (although I fail to even see that), you should just avoid these characters. If anything, they're a good lesson on how NOT to write characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe heorine, Yui, was the only reason I made it past episode one. Her design is pretty and she's likable enough at the start. She doesn't want too be there, and I felt so sorry for her. However instead of trying to change the situation or standing up for herself, she just lets it happen. Her personality doesn't evolve beyond the initial 'scared, naive, innocent victim'. Eventually I stopped feeling sorry for her and started getting irritated. \\n\\n\r\nIf Yui was written so that she started to rebel against the vampires, despite being weaker than them, then I would of had a reason to keep watching. She needed to become stronger and show that she was in charge of her fate. Instead, she rolls over and lets it happen. Maybe she can change in the game? I don't know. Either way, she ends up not having no development and the audience has little reason to keep caring.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1/10\\n\r\nI think this review has made it pretty clear on the lack of enjoyment I had whilst viewing this show.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a perfect example of an otome adaption gone wrong. Not enough character is given to the heroine, and the plot is shoved aside to cram in as much 'bishie' time as possible. As a fan of otome games and romance anime, I can't recommend this show to anyone. I can't even survive one episode without hating on the characters, and despite the episodes being shorter than average, just wanted each one to hurry up and end. \\n\\n\r\nIf you want a reserve harem anime with darker or supernatural elements, go and watch \"Dance with Devils\". If you want an otome to anime adaption done right, go and watch \"Kamigami no Asobi\". Avoid this anime. I feel sorry for the game's creators for having this abomination connected to their franchise. \\n",

If you don't think on it for longer than a second it's not so awful, but once you think on it you begin asking a lot of questions that simply aren't answered or even really hinted at. \r\nThe anime is really pretty to look at, and when Yui's blood isn't beingsucked and she's not the one talking it's actually fine to listen to. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, Yui as a character has absolutely no agency. Which isn't unusual for this genre (visual novels adapted to anime). In visual novels the protagonist tends to have a vanilla personality so anyone can imagine themselves in that position. As a result the dialogue is intensely stilted and unbelievable. This is something that doesn't really work in my opinion in the visual novels, and definitely doesn't work in an anime. (Here is where I note that I'm a huge fan of visual novels, but that will not stop me from pointing out that particular flaw).\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters are okay. As per the visual novel genre they are caricatures of actual personalities, but their very limited backstories are kind of interesting and they're just good fun in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a deep story that makes sense this is not for you.\\n\\n\r\nIf, however, you understand that you're getting into what amounts to a harlequin harem romance novel (complete with vampires and a damsel in distress) you'll probably enjoy the three hours you'll put into it.",

The story seemed okay and the art was truly amazing from what I could see.\r\nSo I decided to watch it, BIG MISTAKE.\r\nI watched all episodes in one go, because there are only twelve of them. I thought it wouldn't hurt much, but I was wrong.\r\nWithin the first ten minutes I was a bit worried already whether this was a good idea or not. Then, two episodes later, Irealized there probably wasn't going to be much character development. 'Well, that's just too bad', I thought, but I kept watching anyway... \\n\\n\r\nMaybe it would turn out okay, who knows?\\n\\n\r\nIt did not get better,\\n\r\nit's like the people responsible for this anime got worried after a while that the viewers would get bored, so they kept adding more and more abuse to keep it interesting. Guess what? It didn't work.\\n\\n\r\nSo even though the story and characters did not work out, I will give it to them that the art and sound is fantastic.\\n\\n\r\nIf you watch anime only for the anime, of which I am guilty of myself sometimes unfortunately, you will enjoy this. If you are not, though, I will not recommend, because even I didn't like this anime, regardless of the great art style, which is the reason why I started watching anime in the first place.",

You literally explained nothing to her at the start, you're just trying to sound superior to her to anyone who wasn't listening to everything else said.  They never once wanted her for who she was, but only because her blood tasted like some dead lady's.  Does anyone remember night school?  She went once and skipped class to make food for the vampire.  I'm pretty sure that they only made that a thing because they wanted her to wear a schooluniform.  These characters are completely unlikable.  They continuously drink her blood and try to kill her.  I don't care that your mother was strict, that's no reason to act this way.  There should be a compilation of Diabolik Lovers, but only the parts where Yui doesn't consent, because there is no progression of Yui's character, she doesn't grow to love it.  They just constantly abuse her.  She is a slave with no way out.  I've seen discussions on this show, but even people who like the show don't seem to care about the characters.  They just talk about how physically attractive they are.  Laito just asserts that there is no god with no backing and expects Yui to believe it.  The only reason the vampires save her in the end, and this is confirmed by a several minute montage, is because they want her blood.  Yui sacrifices herself to save the vampires and end all of it, but they drag her back.  This show is celebrating cruelty, giving in to desperation, and the corrupt.  Yui is still scared and resists, but she has no power against them.  The story is confused, but it still managed to get that across.   One thing is that some of the music is good, and thankfully the composer went on to do bigger and better things.",

            "content": "* sigh *\r\nWhere to begin... Ok, so I've watched this anime about a week ago and I had to let it sink it for a few days, because I honestly didn't know how I felt about it. Still don't by the way.\r\nI came across it on CR and after reading all of the reviews, I was really quited intrueged. It couldn't be THAT bad, could it?\r\nWell, it was... and it wasn't. I get why this anime got so many bad reviews and I don't disagree with the reasoning behind it. However, despite it's many many many many many many flaws, I didn't find it thathorrible, but that has actually very little to do with the anime itself and I'll get to why that is in a minute. Let me break down this review in 7 parts because there's a lot to talk about. \\n\r\n(Please forgive any mistakes, grammar or other, english is not my mothertongue.)\\n\\n\r\nWARNING: there will be some spoilers.\\n\\n\r\n1 - Story\\n\\n\r\nOk, there is no story. Well, not really anyway. As with most of the reverse-harem shows I've watched thus far, I felt like this anime could've been great, outstanding even, if they stayed closer to the source material. And with closer I mean that they could've given us more, much more, but they chose not to for whatever reason. Granted, the source material is, to say the least, very disturbing, but that's what makes it so interesting. Like what Black Butler - Book of Circus did (gosh, it took me a solid few days to get over that one). Instead they give us 11 episodes filled with the brothers sucking her blood over and over again - which gets old real fast - and one actually rather interesting episode. I get it, it's very sexualized like ooh-aah-look-at-what-they're-doing-gasp-blush-yadayada. I think that's what we're supposed to love, but it was way too much and way too frequent. I was quickly bored out of my mind. I rolled my eyes everytime it happened.\\n\r\nBut what really boggled my mind were the last 2 episodes, especially the last one. There is where the story actually pickes up (only to end in that same episode); Things were finally happening and I felt that they could've built around this episode and stretched it out throughout the show. But they didn't. Why? Because reasons.\\n\r\n(NOTE: I've also watched season 2 and it's the same thing)\\n\\n\r\n2 - Art\\n\\n\r\nThe art is simply stunning and I have actually no negative things to say about it, what makes it even worse. It's like getting a beautifully wrapped present with nothing in it. \\n\\n\r\n4 - Sound\\n\\n\r\nThe music is rather good, I even have one song added to my anime playlist which I only do when I really enjoy it, but there's only one so I wouldn't say it was really outstanding. It did fit the anime rather well tho.\\n\\n\r\n5 - Character\\n\\n\r\nAnd here is where the real issue lies. Let's start with our \"heroine\"... Yui. \\n\\n\r\nAfter watching the first episode, my first impression of her was: \"Well, she's not too bad, I don't know what other people are complaining about.\" After episode 2 and 3, I was like: \"Ok, I'm starting to get it\" and after watching half of this anime, I was completely over it. Like done. Finito.\\n\r\nMy God in the Heavens Above, she is so unbelievably dull and annoyingly stupid, I actually found myself agreeing with most of the brothers.\\n\r\nThere is one scene where one of them says to her: \"You are really stupid, you know\" or something along those lines and I yelled at my TV: \"YES, SHE IS! SHE REALLY REALLY IS!\" All these brothers force themselves onto her and all she can say is: \"Please, let go!\" Sis, after they sucked your blood for the umpteenth time, you should know by now that THEY WILL NOT LET YOU GO! Kick! Scream! Punch! Do something! She even has a knife that could kill or at the very least hurt them, but does she use it? No, because why would she(!) You could actually make a drinking game out of this (spoiler-alert: you will get hammered). At this point, I couldn't even blame them anymore and that's not something I like to do, especially when it's borderline-rapey, but girl...\\n\r\nBut then again she really is stupid. Second example: one of the brothers - one of the nicer ones - gives her a chance to leave, which she initially intends to do. She's in her room packing her bags and suddenly she stops, saying to herself: \"No, I have to find out more why this or that happened.\" and I was like: \"BITCH, can't you do that from afar?!?\" Go to the church where they left you, go to where your father lives, go to the police, hell, go anywhere for that matter.\" UGH!\\n\\n\r\nNow for the brothers, this is where things (could) get interesting, but here is where it all went wrong. The brothers are by far the best part of this anime and there were plenty of chances to delve deeper into their backstory which they kinda did... Or didn't they? Now here is where my Wiki-searching-ability comes in. After the first few episodes, I really wanted to know more about what the story actually was or rather could be since I had the feeling they weren't going to give me much. And after reading the Wiki, I really understood why the brothers were the way they were and even felt for them. Their past and upbringing was so gruesome, so abusive that they were denied any kind of real love (which actually has a reasoning behind it, but I think you can already guess that it's not in the anime - *major sigh*). Add in the fact that they are bloodthirsty vampires, you could really understand and kinda forgive their rudeness and rapey actions. Problem is that you wouldn't know that by watching the anime by itself and that's the biggest miss on the creators' part. It's like those people who're always yelling when a movie based on a book gets negative reviews: \"But you guys, the book is soooo much better.\" Sure, Elizabeth, but a film and anime should be able to stand on it's own. And to be quite honest, I got more out of reading the Wiki-page than from the anime itself. There was so much to work with, there was so much room for character development or at least something were we as the viewers could relate to the characters, feel for them, care for them, especially since their target audience are women. But instead, what they showed us was so little and extremely confusing that I honestly don't know if I could've followed it without the extra information I've gotten from the net. Missed chances, as with so many reverse-harem shows. It actually angers me if I'm really honest.\\n\\n\r\n6 -Enjoyment \\n\\n\r\nEh. Did I enjoy it? I honestly don't know. The only thing I enjoyed were the brothers, but again, that's mostly because of what I knew from reading the Wiki. If I didn't do that, well... There is not much to enjoy. Yes, I had my favorite (Ayato) and yes, the last episode was kinda good, but yeah... I stopped watching 3 times because I was so bored and annoyed only to start watching it again. It's like this weird mysogynistic train crash which would've fueled the fire of Lucifer in my heart if this would've happened in real life or even in a live-action show, yet oddly enough that doesn't happen while watching this anime. Instead I was in a state of disbelief and I was constantly asking myself how in the hell did this even got made the way it is. This anime is a weird one, it truly is.\\n\\n\r\n7 - Overall\\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't recommend this anime, because there's nothing to recommend, especially if you are sensitive to rape-like scenes or if you really enjoy character development or just a good story. I wouldn't even recommend it to reverse-harem or otome-game-based-anime-fans. Chances are you'll really be disappointed. Instead I'll say: read the Wiki-page or play the games (I haven't played them myself, but I will in the near future). \\n\r\nThere could be a possibility that they will delve deeper into the actual story, which is rather interesting, especially the father (who's not even in the anime, not really anyway) and he could've really made the story better: the elusive and mysterious Vampire King, a man with an actual plan. Add in his younger brother who's aiming for his throne through manipulations and extreme deviousness, his wives and the interaction between them, his true motivation and why the brothers are the way they are. Like come on, the story practically writes itself. But after watching 2 seasons (and season 2 isn't actually a continuation of the anime but rather a spin-off with a whole new bunch of brothers (why I ask you??)) I don't hold my breath.\\n\\n\r\nSIDE NOTE: reverse-harem shows and even otome games (I'm very ashamed to admit it) became one of my guilty pleasures, but I'm still waiting on one where the heroine actually is a heroine and not a dull, stuttering, stupid and clueless girl. As a woman, I actually find this quite offensive. UtaPri, Brother's Conflict, Some-Show-About-A-Girl-Who-Has-To-Live-With-Gods-But-I-Cant-Remember-The-Name-Exactly, they all have the same in common.

For all the whining and moping Bella Swan does, she still has some bit of an impulsive and defiant streak. None to be had with the girl in this anime.\r\nWhat bothers me is that this girl is absolutely andcompletely in the dark and for maybe two seconds one of the guys won't treat her like absolute dirt but there they go again sucking her blood or calling her very rude and demeaning names or hurting and scaring her. Not even the 'kichiku megane' is appealing to me, and I really, really dig those kind of glasses-wearing asshats. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is passable, but it features that dreaded art styling where the eye outlines can be seen through the hair. \\n\\n\r\nThe shortness of each episode makes this much more bearable than it would be if it was a full 20+ minutes. \\n\\n\r\nThe only thing this is good for is a hearty chuckle at how absolutely bad it is.

Erm.. Blood-sucking scenes.. \r\nThis anime is more headed to the type of people who doesn't pay attention to the MAIN love couple, it's a type of anime that has many love interests and not just one.  I recommend this animemore to people who are open-minded and who likes fantasies.. The art on this anime is fairly acceptable, not too bad or not too much details.. The characters in the anime are uniqe but some really are almost the same when it came to their personality, it was always, \"I want bloodddd\" or \"OK I have a mark on you so you're basically MINE.\" The plot was really, weak, it doesn't really show much interest into the plot, I mean it does gradually interpret the plot but, I still find it confusing and you might too.. \\n\\n\r\nI still find this anime good and entertaining but I wouldn't focus into these kinds of animes..\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score:\\n\r\n8.2/10",

We all know that plots form over time but darn. This just way below short!! The story was unclear and at times I didn't even know what was going on at all. It was all mindless nonsense that couldn't be deciphered. Furthermore, there were uncalled for flashbacksthat attempted to form a backstory on each character that was not explained, or explored further.\\n\\n\r\nArt- The art was highly modern with vibrant colors.\\n\\n\r\nSound- The voice actors did an amazing job with bringing the characters to life.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- The characters were the biggest let down!!! There was nothing to gold onto, The characters basically had the same  personality. NO ONE had a mind of their own, it was so ridiculous!! Each character was just mindless with no sense of improvement of growth. Character development was not there at all. The story attempted to give viewers heart touching moments with character flashbacks... but it fell short. \\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime is so bad that its actually funny. There was no were I actually enjoyed watching this anime and.. to be frank i am over it... please do not waste your time.",

            "content": "Diabolik Lovers gets a bad rep because it lacks plot, character dynamics and overall realism.  But that's the thing about Diabolik Lovers, it wasn't trying to romance you in those elements.\r\nYou have to see the show for what it is.  See, t\u007fhe first thing you should know about Diabolik Lovers (DL) is that this whole series is based on a fantasy choose-your-ending love game featuring dark vampires.  That alone should tell you that the only side of you Diabolik Lovers wants to appeal to is your lustful side.  From that perspective, DL does it's job perfectly.\r\nIn fact, for an anime madesolely for servicing it's audience in a very specific way, the plot is fair.  It's interesting enough.  Was it moving, emotional or even believable?  No.  But was it supposed to be?  Nope! The plot is only needed to give the lusty moments within the anime context.\\n\\n\r\nAsking for a real plot from a show like Diabolik Lovers is both pointless and counter-productive. Silly gooses.\\n\\n\r\nLike the plot, the main character Yui gets a lot of criticism as well, for not being smart, strong or even interesting.  But much like how comic book artists purposely make heroes like Superman's features vague and inexact, Yui was carefully constructed to be personality-less and direction-less.  This clean-slate of a protagonist allows members of the audience more agency, providing them an easy pair of shoes to stick their feet in for better experience, and better fantasy.  This anime is all about the you, the audience, after all.\\n\\n\r\nYui's weak inability to fight and submission also matches with a vampire's inhumane strength.  It also allows her male counterparts the freedom they need to provide proper fan service to us.  It's all on purpose, people.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the art, the sound, the enjoyment... This is where DL was trying.  For an anime that had one specific, unconventional goal of simply catering to the lustful side of their audience, I think DL nailed it.  The art is beautiful, the music, silences, and voice acting are convincing, and it was certainly enjoyable to watch.  It \\n\\n\r\nThis show is one of the most controversial that I've come across, and I think it's because most people who are used to classic shoujo harem just don't know what to do with a show like Diabolik Lovers.  But if you see it for what it is, a lust-filled dating game turned into a TV show, you must admit the creators did very well.  A+ and I'm hoping for season 3!",

            "content": "All right, what the hell. I just finished this anime recently, so I might as well write it up while it's fresh in my mind. Maybe this will be my new hobby. Well, if you decide to watch Diabolik Lovers, then brace yourself for the ultimate cringe.\r\nStory: 2/10 Ugh, the story (or lack of it) is abominable. All it consists is the protagonist getting drained by each of the brothers. What else is there to say?\r\nArt: 7/10 Admittedly, the art is one of the more positive aspects of the show. It was the main reason why I decided to watch this show. The characters eachhave their own unique color scheme that I really adore. And who can go wrong with pastel gradient hair? But even so, that doesn't save this monstrosity.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10 I have mixed feelings about the sound. On one hand, the OP and ending songs are quite catchy. Both really fit the sadism and carnality Diabolik Lovers ramps up. The dubbed voices were overall tolerable. (Although I can't look at Asura from Soul Eater the same way again, knowing that the VA for him also voices one of the douchebag vampires.) But on the other end of the spectrum, the vampire suckling noises are downright catatonic. I'd almost rather hear nails dragged across a chalkboard. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 3/10 Let me tell you, there is absolutely no character development whatsoever. Nearly all the characters were extremely appalling. The protagonist has no personality or backbone. She's pretty much a walking bloodbank. She lets herself get sucked by each of the brothers without trying to fight back. It's pathetic. Also, nearly all the vampires have varying levels of psychopathy and sadism. (Well, there was one vampire I kind of liked, although his debut involved him punching a freaking wall.) Finally, the villains were complete bores and were absolutely unnecessary. They had barely any charisma that would've painted them as memorable.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10 My instincts want me to give this a 2, but I'll bump it up a point just for the one character I like, the art, and how \"decent\" the sound is. I guess it was a good test of my strength enduring these episodes. (On a final note, I would add that the ending was completely predictable. Typical for masochistic vampire \"romances.\")\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10 OK, I confess. Even though I read the reviews on how horrible it was on here, I had to see how terrible it was myself. And I wasn't disappointed! It's a wonder I made it through the dozen, especially since I was wincing the entirety of the premiere. Perhaps I am a masochist.\\n\\n\r\nWell, I see there are some sequels to this abomination. To watch or not to watch? That is the question at hand. \\n\\n",

I thought that it was just vampires hitting on a girl until the girl chooses the one she spent the most time with no hints as to why shes there. i didnt get bored and had to skip any of the scenes (except when the vampires bite yui, its just boring and tiring to wait for it to stop, but i dont find it to be something that bothers me alot). \r\nthe hints make u think, why? when? what? how?. but it doesnt let u think why for that long, after all each episode is just14 mins. So i dont really get bored thinking. i dont think its gonna be like this forever where they only give u hints and no explanation\\n\\n\r\nStory 6 or 7.5/10\\n\r\nits interesting. not being all about justice and stuff. its interesting enough to draw me in. nothing really special about it\\n\\n\r\nalot of people are annoyed how she doesnt get amnemia. i mean like she did faint sometimes. but i get their point. This problem doesnt really annoy me though. Though i might know why she doesnt faint alot or already died\\n\\n\r\nSPOILERS AHEAD!!!\\n\\n\r\nSPOILER\\n\r\nshe has a             heart     of a                     vampire (I think its a vampire) so that might explain why.\\n\r\nSPOILER\\n\\n\r\nSPOILERS ABOVE!!!\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\nno problems here. i like the colorful hair and eyes. \\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\r\nthe voiceactors suit the characters very well. no problems here either. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10\\n\r\nI like them. I like how the vampires are sadistic and stuff. it bothers me that yui is so weak which i mean is understandable since its really difficult to escape and the vampires would punish her. Though something really bothers me but i dont know what it is.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\r\nIts nice. it doesnt have like \"major\" nudity like where the characters are currently taking a shower or something.i dont like the drinking blood scenes since they are sometimes weird and last too long.\\n\\n\r\nIts not the best anime. But i do think people exaggerate about how this anime is super bad.\\n",

(how does it work???) its just rape, and its not good but it is at least mildly entertaining to joke about with friends.  I fully believe that my life has become worse in all ways after watching this show\r\nThe famed Oscar wining classic, Spy kids 2, said it best,\r\n Do you think that God stays inheaven because he too lives in fear of what he has created? -Romero, 2002",
