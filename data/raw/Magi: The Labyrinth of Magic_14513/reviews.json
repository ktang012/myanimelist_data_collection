            "content": "First of all I didn't expect anything from this anime. As I read the description I thought \" not another anime, show, movie, about fair tales... who wants to see this .... \" But due to the lack of any good anime and thanks to a nice review I've read, I thought I will give it a try. \r\nSo I got hooked right away. \r\nAfter the first minutes I wasn't sure yet if it was a childish anime or if it was made for a broader audience. After watching 12 epsiodes I can tell you its for a broader audience, so no worries!\r\nStory:\r\nLet me tellyou, its not 1001 nights as the description states. Its an anime which is set in ancient times (actually bit later propably in 1200..). Magi borrows names and phrases from various known stories like 1001 nights for example.\\n\r\nBut this Anime has nothing to do with 1001 nights, only because the names are the same doesn't mean anything. So if you don't like simple fairy tales, dont worry this is all about a fantasy world in post-ancient times with a lot of magic. It also borrows things from other mythologies like Celtic mythology, Chinese mythology..etc.\\n\\n\r\nThe Story takes place in a time of chaos and where war ravages and the spirit of revolution is in the air. Where magic has awoken anew. Magic created dungeons all over the world. By conquering those dungeons you can get immense powers. New kings get crowned, people stand up for their rights and people go on adventures.\\n\r\nIn this world the main protagonists; Aladadin, Alibaba and Morgiana; try to find their own ways and try to take part in these historic times. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nI think all characters are nice and you will get fond of them very easily. There are three main characters, which are very well done. Their development is not exaggerated and not underdeveloped. The characters have time to change but they stay true to their key elements. Even though there might be various anime cliches form time to time above all as Alibabas character design is considered, but the anime never got consumed too much into any anime cliches. Actually when you are at the brink of thinkin that this anime turned into another boring \"Emo\" cliched anime, it doesnt fail to turn the tables and get you hooked even more. \\n\\n\r\nArt+ Sound:\\n\r\nI like the art very much, also how they portray the emotions of the characters, It makes you laugh sometimes and gives the anime a unique flair. The sound is nothing noticeable tho...\\n\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this Anime is really worth watching. It reminds me of those old epic anime I loved so much, and why I started watching Anime in the first place. But it only reminds me of if! It hasnt conquered my heart fully yet, Ive only seen 12 episodes so far there is still a lot of space above this anime and beneath it. I gave it 10 points filled with a lot of hope that it doesn't disappoint me after those 12 nice episodes. ;)",

            "content": "From someone who has watched countless shounen, it becomes typical to  look at a show labelled \"shounen\", and dismiss it as mundane and cliche. But with every new addition to this vast genre, there are always shows/manga that stick out more than others. \nThankfully, Magi does this.\nStory: (9/10) With a setting based on Arabian Nights, you can expect (or at least hope for), a gripping narrative. Thankfully, Magi is structured so that the focus on the two main protagonists (Alibaba and Aladdin) is well orchestrated, and has a unique vibe to it. Through this, the story can become very dark and gripping, while notlosing the narrative. What differentiates this from other shounen is the political aspect. As a king, you must reign. But how will you do it? Through this question the different nations and factions can interact in a believable environment, without it ever feeling like the author is asking you to pretend they would do that.\\n\\n\nArt: (8/10) Most shounens typically fall under long broadcasting widths. While this allows for a developed story, the art tends to suffer long-term. Thankfully the animators have cut the show into a one season arc, while providing room to adapt more chapters if need be. For this reason, the art is well developed. Backgrounds are detailed and varied, with character models being round and developed. There are few jagged edges apparent, which helps realism. The battle scenes don't suffer with still shots (too much), and motion does not degrade the animation. It stays fluid throughout, with the exception of the comedy scenes. Through these, the show takes a different animation style. While humorous in a way, it detracts from the overall value. I don't see the joke through their expressions, but rather, through the goofy way they're drawn.\\n\\n\nSound: (9/10) One of Magi's strong points. Both openings provide a gateway into Arabia, with a melody and vocalist that resemble the middle eastern style. It opens the door to the show, making the transition to background music worthwhile. With this, you experience a variety of festival soundtracks, battle hymns, and adventure tunes. The depth and well execution of sound makes for a more enjoyable watch. This is followed by the endings which slightly devalue the soundtrack. While not bad, they don't carry the show to the end. Had they been chosen better, the desire to continue watching would have been more apparent.\\n\\n\nCharacters: (10/10) The characters in a show must be well rounded for the plot to work. No matter how great a set piece, it won't work without strong protagonists. And Magi delivers. Alibabba is a naive individual with to much idealism. This pushes the plot forward. Aladdin is a childish yet strangely deep character. His character shifts add emotion to the story. Morgiana is the strong, shackled female who can offer great moments through her actions. This trio has a well-blended bond that works. Their conversations kept me through the show, eager to see how they will handle future situations. The background characters, of which there are to many to name, are stunning. They have unique personalities, and offer believable lines that push the narrative further. Each new individual can hold their own as a main character, and you can care for each one of them. They're so developed you almost want to root for the bad guy.\\n\\n\nEnjoyment (9/10) I spent a week watching this show to prepare for the second season. After finishing, I was impatient waiting for season 2. This show was well worth the time put in, and will absolutely have a lasting effect on your view of how a shounen should be.\\n\\n\nOverall: (9/10) Magi is a show that should be watched, for it offers a well developed plot that's backed by great sound, art, and characters. For those into shounen, this'll  be a guaranteed favorite. For those wanting to get into the genre, it's a good starting point. And for those opposed of the genre, you're missing out.",

            "content": "So, you believe in magic? Whether that answer is a yes or no, Magi sets itself as an unique series of a classical adventure for anime fans. It's a wonderful experience and there are many ways in which Magi portrays its adventures with its cast of characters. Now, get ready because Magi might just be something to refresh your weekend with its old school themes and premise.\r\nMagi (also known as Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic as its full title) is a manga written by Shinobu Ohtaka. The series takes place in an universe that has has desert artwork scattered all around. As such, its themerelates to the classical One Thousand and One Nights and its collections. It feels like a classic honestly with its settings and atmosphere. From the beginning, we quickly meet all three of the main protagonists in the series. It doesn't take long for the action and drama to pick up its pace as in the first few episodes already explores some of the cruelty (such as slavery), the dungeons, and monstrosity that exists in the Magi universe. \\n\\n\r\nThe series is packed with both a lighthearted and action style mood as the episodes progresses. One of the things that we see is the interesting and bro-like relationship between the two main characters \u2013 Aladdin and Alibaba. Although not related, they have a close bond and a brotherly relationship in which the two often looks out after one another. The two travels together in their quests and adventures  . It's a fantasy adventure that gives off that old school like feeling as they explore the world of Magi.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough not one-hundred percent compatible, the duo has similar personalities. Both Aladdin and Alibaba shares a personality of wanting to explore the world as well as having an initiative to help others in need. They put others above themselves and always constantly looks after each others' well being. The relationship between the two is very fun to watch given their lighthearted interactions and how they conquer obstacles along the way. Additionally, the duo are very loyal and seeks ways to form bonds with others whether through words or their actions. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, this doesn't always last.\\n\\n\r\nFor some reason, the series breaks off its trials for a bit later on. The two goes off of their directions and seemingly begins their own tales. From there on, the duo seems to become independent of their own journeys as they explore their own worlds. It seems to be more character focused rather than a story by this point and things start to slow down. Additionally, what continues on seems to have little influence on the duo's journey and adventures. That and the fact in which their adventures gets off its tracks with no intertwined effect on one another seems to make a few frown on some die hard fans' faces.\\n\\n\r\nLuckily, there's still another character that brings on entertainment to Magi. Her name is Morgania and she's one tough girl with an even tougher childhood.\\n\\n\r\nJoining the duo later on, Morgania (Mor) is a young 14 years old girl who always had a tough childhood. Forced into slavery and with little freedom, we see her struggles in the world of Magi. Prior to her liberation, her personality exists opposite of the dynamic duo that we are already familiar with. Her cold personality reflects on the cruelty of what she already been through. It makes us feel sorry for her as a child and how she came to be. Yet, later on, we do see more of her caring side. In fact, Morgania even begins risking her own life to protect others in need and putting herself above others. It's proven that Morgania has forged a strong friendship with Alibaba and Aladdin and they are possibly the most important people in her life.\\n\\n\r\nOther characters in the series also has a way of setting themselves from the others. Most of their names (including the main protagonists) are based off One Thousand and One Nights along with some of its settings and themes. There are the many tribes with their leaders and prominent members such as Sinbad and Judal. They play their roles and given their status and power are considered respected as well as feared throughout the Magi world.\\n\\n\r\nThe magic part of the series also takes in every episode of course. The magic theme of the series involves the power of the djinns that comes along from the users' metal vessels. Other terms related to magic include rukh, magoi, dungeon capturer, and magi itself. It's hard to say that these themes all tie together well by they do go hand in hand. In fact, most of Magi has a desert like setting unlike our modern civilization with fancy cars, technology, and architecture. As a matter of fact, it's portrayed in that fantasy like setting with its old school like backgrounds.\\n\\n\r\nAs magi is considered the title, it is also considered a respectful term known by its name. We clearly know and see that Aladdin is a magi with his powers of being able to summon Ugo, a blue muscular like familiar that fights on his behalf. Yet at the same time, it seems that Aladdin also lacks the precise knowledge of how to perfect his skills especially later on against an antagonist. It is by this time we know that there is so much mystery that meets the eye of being what a magi is all about. Yet, with the help of his dear friends, Aladdin may unlock those mysteries.\\n\\n\r\nThe series' action is portrayed as being part of the shounen style. It involves the characters powering up, making speeches in the middle of fights, and trying to show off what they can do. To be honest, it is quite generic and some of the same cliched action scenes are forced in many ways. For example, the battle between Aladdin and another fellow magi later on starts one-sided. Yet later on, it turns around the tide and has our main protagonist Aladdin do \u201cwhat is right and stop him\u201d. The action also seems to be forced as well such as the powering up and dynamic entrances from some of the characters. Whether entering in or exiting out, it seems to be forced and lacks true action.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork design of the series is natural and sophisticated. Because it is based off One Thousand and One Nights and some of its themes, we can expect the desert like settings and their sequences employed further with the usage of magic. Most if not all of the characters are dressed in ways that are old fashioned and suited to the Sahara like backgrounds. The forest, desert, and architecture adapts an old school style that is natural and straight to the point. It doesn't try to stand out above the others in the artwork development. In fact, its visuals are focused and fluid that fits with each other.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of soundtrack, Hiromi Kikuta (Black Rock Shooter, Scrapped Princess) employs his skills in orchestrating the OST. Some of the soundtracks has that classic Arabian rhythms while other times pulls its course together with its full throttle pacing. This is especially true during scenes involving based chased at night time or when there are crucial moments of conflict. Shiro Sagisu does a similar job with his music as well with its appealing scores. The opening song, \u201cV.I.P\u201d by SID catches the viewers' attention with the way it is orchestrated by presenting the montage of its characters as well as some of the action going on. Oh and let's not forget about the all-star cast coming together. Although generic, it is appealing and classic.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Magi is a classic. It is a fantasy adventure that brings back the old school feeling with its cast of characters, its themes, style, story telling, and visual artworks. The division of the duo in later episodes may catch viewers off balance but it can still be appealing when we see more of the character backgrounds of our heroes. The trio in fact becomes a pivotal point in the series as they explore the world they never thought would come across. With magic, they can do almost anything but with friends and what they believe in, they become the next big thing. Whether Magi is the next big thing is hard to say but the adventure of Alibaba, Aladdin, and Morgania has come a long way.",

Magi is similar to Mirai Nikki in the way that they both havebatsh*t crazy mofos in it. \\n\\n\r\nnow to the review part.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\r\nawesome story. i love the arabian knights concept and the who concept of clearing dungeons and magic ect.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:10\\n\r\nAli Baba is awesome, i like his design and hes not useless compared to Aladdin. in many animes there will be an overpowered character followed by a useless \"sakura haruno\" type but this is not the case.\\n\r\nAladdin always cracks me up when he mentions boobs.\\n\r\nSharif is also one of my favorite characters so far because hes just straight up insane.\\n\\n\r\nSound/Art: 10\\n\r\nlove the opening and artwork looks amazing\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nif i could give it more than a 10/10 i would\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nagain,  if i could give it more than a 10/10, i would be much obliged. \\n\\n\r\nhope this helped persuade you to watch this AMAZING ANIME!!!!\\n\\n",

            "content": "I\u00b4ll start this review by saying that i haven\u00b4t read the manga yet, im saying this because many people say that the anime isn\u00b4t on the same level of the manga and that it is a bad adaptation missing out chapters and giving bad explanations about how things work. So keep in mind that i\u00b4m doing this review having only the knowledge given by the anime.\r\nStory/Setting/Combat depth - Ok, so i\u00b4m not only reviewing the story and world here but the combat depth too, because i think that it\u00b4s an important part on any battle anime.\r\nSETTING\r\nThe story is set in an alternate recreation of theancient Old World with several regions and nations having some resemblances with real-life counterparts from that time. In this world, all living beings possess an essence known as Rukh  and when they die, this essence returns to the huge flow (also known as \"guidance\") of Rukh that gives life to all subsequent beings in an eternal cycle of rebirth called \"Fate\". Once a person is overcome with sadness, anger and hopelessness, their Rukh turns into a corrupted, unstable, black-colored Rukh that deviates from the main guidance in a process known as \"Fall into Depravity\".\\n\\n\r\nThere are also several magic castles full of treasures and traps known as \"Dungeons\" and each of them is the lair of a powerful magic being, a Djinn. Individuals that manage to overcome the trials of a Dungeon and earn the allegiance of its Djinn are known as Dungeon Capturers, gaining the ability to use its powers infused in a personal item of them known as \"Metal Vessel\" and create less potent \"Household Vessels\" for their companions as well.\\n\\n\r\nPeople can use the Rukh in their bodies to create an energy known as Magoi ( kinda like chakra in naruto ) to power their magical weapons and abilities. This energy must be used with care, as despite the fact that an individual's magoi can be restored with feeding and rest, once fully exhausted it provokes their death. Among those that can perform magic with their own Magoi there is a rare class of magicians known as Magi, that can also use Magoi from the Rukh around them, greatly increasing their capabilities. A Magi usually chooses Dungeon Capturers to offer guidance and protection making of them their King Vessels. There are several nations in history that were founded or improved by the rule of such individuals.\\n\\n\r\nPLOT\\n\\n\r\nSo the story of magi starts out really simple but as the anime progresses it keeps evolving and adding important and nice stuff. This is the story about a young boy by the name of Aladdin and his adventures around the world of magi. Like many other series he becomes friends with many people, 2 of them are Alibaba and Morgiana, and so the 3 of them become the main characters.\\n\\n\r\n The story is mostly about war between empires/countries. Where Aladdin enters in all this is that he is a magi, a beeing that acording to legends chooses his king to control the world. Throughout the story we learn that there is more than 1 magi and that they are not on the same side so that only means 1 thing, war. There is a dark organization too called the Al Thamen that are trying to screw up the world and that side up with the empire aladdin and his friends are fighting. \\n\\n\r\nCOMBAT DEPTH\\n\\n\r\nEasily the thing i like the most about magi, there is enough depth here to the point you have to google some definitions.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the fodders use normal weapons without any special abilities, but the main weapon of all people here is Magoi, it works out like chakra from naruto, each person has their own reserve and only magi can use the magoi from the rukh around them.\\n\\n\r\nThere is the dungeon capturers too, people that successfully pass a dungeon can keep in their control the djinn of that dungeon. The djinn enters into a metal and the capturer can use that djinn\u00b4s power. For example, if a djinn\u00b4s ability is fire, that person can attack with fire. But that\u00b4s not only it, thats the basic. As time passes and you became better with your metal vessal you can use an ability called Djinn Equip, by using that your metal vessal turns into the djinn\u00b4s weapon and your ability ( fire in this case ) becomes even better. Djinn equip has diferent levels, at first you can only use the djinn\u00b4s weapon but later on you can even cover your whole body with armours and stuff. You can only maintain this ability as long as your magoi reserves let you. Oh and one more thing, if the Djinn capturer is a magi he can summon the djinn in battle ( this is exclusive of magis ).\\n\\n\r\nHousehold Vessels are objects (weapons, jewelry, accessories, etc) that hold importance to the Household Members of a Dungeon Capturer. Like for example, if my djinn type is fire my household member will have an ability connected with fire. ( Household vessels are not as strong as the djinn equip ( exclusive to dungeon capturers)).\\n\\n\r\nThere is magicians too that can manipulate their rukh and create a type of magic ( healing, heat, water, gravity etc ), with that they can create many abilities.\\n\\n\r\nIm only 25 episodes in ( 1st season ) and there is a ton of combat depth, im sure there is many many more things :)\\n\\n\r\nART\\n\\n\r\nVery colourful, there isn\u00b4t much to be said here.\\n\r\nGo to youtube and see for yourself.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nNot good enough to deserve a better score, like always the japanese voices are great but there is a lack of better osts.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nAladdin - Like i said above, a young magi boy that is traveling the world and making many friends ( sorta like luffy ) he is your typical shounen protagonist which in my opinion is a bit to mainstream but whatever.\\n\\n\r\nAlibaba - Aladdin\u00b4s friend and main character, he is a really great character and his personality develops really well and you learn about his backstory.\\n\\n\r\nMorgiana - Aladdin\u00b4s friend and main character, she, like alibaba in terms of personality develops a lot too. She belongs to a tribe called Fanalis, Fanalis are a really strong type of tribe with power that can crush rocks.\\n\\n\r\nAll the other characters are really good in design but as not very much developed ( maybe because its only 25 episodes, i dont know ).\\n\\n\r\nI can\u00b4t really say much more without spoiling it, it\u00b4s better if you watch.",

            "content": "Shows like Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic really catch me off guard. It's so rare nowadays to see a battle shonen that delivers a feeling of exploration without getting too caught up in itself. Is it perfect? Of course not, but if there's one thing it gets right is its sense of adventure. \r\nMagi takes place in a vast fantasy world with a ton of tie-ins to 1001 Arabian Nights. The setting is huge, spanning across many diverse countries, which presents an enthrallingly enormous scope. Aladdin is a young boy who some call a Magi, and the story follows his journey for self-discovery alongside hisfriends Alibaba Saluja and Morgiana of the Fanalis, who each have responsibilities and dark pasts of their own. Dungeons have been rising around the world, and the conquerors of said dungeons gain the power of a Djinn, which is basically an elemental genie. They are risen by those called Magi, who are said to be the ones to shape the world. Only three are supposed to be around in one era, but Aladdin, for some reason or another, is seen as the fourth. Along their journey, they encounter people of many kinds, ranging from the Kou dynasty which is essentially Magi's take on China, to even such figures like Sinbad of the Seven Seas. Yes, the allusions to that old desert fairy tale book, no, not the bible, are many, but seeing such a setting in an anime is extremely refreshing and gives way for some awesome locales and set pieces. \\n\\n\r\nThe art, albeit mildly inconsistent, if nicely detailed, and the character designs are fitting, memorable, colourful and just generally well crafted. The palette really captures the scorching desert heat as well as the cool city nights, making for a very immersive experience. Sadly, the same cannot be said about the fight choreography. There's a very clunky feeling to a lot of the battles due to awkward shot composition and somewhat lazy animation. The only times the fights actually impress me are when Morgiana gets involved, which may be because the animators are forced to work with punches and kicks rather than actual weapons. A1 Pictures has a bad habit of using cuts to avoid animating motion, which can get quite jarring when used frequently. If you're looking for a big budget action show, then Magi may not be for you, although the aesthetics do a fantastic job of sucking you into the world. \\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, many fights become very anticlimactic thanks to the overly fast pacing. Many of the villains get demolished only minutes after making their debut. This lack of tension becomes especially apparent during the final battle. Some are just downright silly, with the villains getting as laughable as an old man on a floating wheelchair, and some very out of place fanservice. There are a lot of cliches to be found in general. \\n\\n\r\nDespite this however, the show isn't completely generic, and this is mainly true in the surprisingly well founded cast. On the surface, Aladdin is your typical na\u00efve shota, but he has an exceptionally mature mentality in regards to society, and knows when to let others act rather than himself, showing a lot of wisdom. There's a lot of strong personalities in Magi, the highlights being the charismatic Sinbad, and the feeble yet lovable Hakuryuu. Judal is just the right level of crazy, and is a good contrast to Aladdin's light-hearted nature. Most of the humour will be hit or miss, relying on a lot of boob jokes, but there's a lot of heart to be found. \\n\\n\r\nA big theme of Magi is fate, and what it means to accept one's destiny. While there could've been a lot more done with it, the show does a very good job of showing how one's destiny can doom them into despair, or as the show calls it, depravity. Alibaba's relationship with Cassim is not only engaging to watch, but both grow a lot over the course of the show, as does Morgiana as she works through her past as a slave. \\n\\n\r\nFor a shonen, Magi delves into a lot of dark themes, but they're handled in a very black and white way, making it difficult to really take something away from them. Every villain bar one is just evil for the sake of being evil, and it's hard to get behind some of the messages when they could only help out in a fairy tale. I wish that more effort was put into making things seem more realistic, but in a way, that's a part of Magi's charm. It's not trying to be a social commentary, but rather a fun adventure, with some darker overtones to appeal to an older audience. \\n\\n\r\nThe second opening really makes this apparent with it's sense of wonder. Overall, the soundtrack is quite good, and it brings forth a distinctive Arabic flare while utilizing a lot of modern instruments, the electric guitar in particular. A lot of battle tracks are quite memorable as well, my favourites being Valse Hot and Enfin Apparu. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Magi season one is a solid watch if you're a fan of a massive setting and well founded characters, as long as you're not looking for the most mature story ever told. There are a few plotholes here and there, but compared to others in its genre, it holds up substantially well. I give Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic, a 7/10.",

            "content": "The series starts off light-hearted like many modern series to come out these days, but starts to get serious rather quickly with a nice pace. The world building is nice and breathing compared to many series that make lack-luster attempts these days, and I could even go as far to compare it to the Full metal Alchemist series for a general feeling towards character development and story. Unfortunately, the series turns to absolute rubbish at episode 16 where the whole politically focused plot turns out to just be a really cliche story about \"muh darkness\", as mysterious masked men try stop them for the sakeof being evil. Everything after episode 16 feels really cliche and shallow in comparison, characters randomly acting like slice-of-life characters from generic high school anime #9840 complete with over the top emoji tier expressions that I so deeply fucking despise in Anime.  I tried to continue the series, hoping maybe the writer was just having a bad rut, but it didn't really improve. Dropped at episode 21 and didn't look back.",

            "content": "Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic is a tale of friendship triumphing over all odds. Perhaps you have heard this kind of story told elsewhere. If so, you've probably heard it told better, too. Magi is all over the place in terms of pacing and tone. Even the morals of the story seem quite in conflict with the methods used to tell it. Above all, it's just dumb and boring, which are two death sentences for an anime from this viewer's perspective.\r\nMagi is about two boys. Aladdin is an impressionable, airheaded young Magi, or wandering mage. He comes across a golden-haired and golden-hearted street urchin namedAlibaba, and they go on an adventure through a massive labyrinth called a \"dungeon\", becoming fast friends. Along the way, they encounter a mysterious and strong-legged slave girl named Morgiana, which completes their trio as they endeavor to right the world's wrongs with the phat lewts they obtained by raiding and \"capturing\" the dungeon.\\n\\n\r\nIt's right here that I should make it clear that Alibaba is perhaps the worst shounen hero I've ever seen. His character shifts between whining interminably about the state of the world, declaring it impossible to change, and attempting to change the world through perhaps the most idiotic and sure-fail ways he could come up with. He is perpetually gullible, all-too-willing to put his trust in other people with blatantly obvious \"hidden\" agendas. Say what you will about how stupid Naruto is, at least he didn't turn a blind eye to Sasuke's gradual descent into darkness. In contrast, Alibaba's childhood friend from the first arc might as well hold a giant flashing neon sign over his head that says \"I will die and/or turn evil\" for how unsubtly the series depicts him, but Alibaba never once takes the hint.\\n\\n\r\nIn this first arc, we are also introduced to Sinbad, a character that has already become a legendary king and dungeon-capturer by his own hand. He pledges his aid to helping Alibaba liberate Balbadd from the clutches of its fat, stupid king. It is at this point that the series starts undermining its own tension, because Sinbad is ludicrously overpowered compared to literally everyone else, and has eight underlings of various shapes and sizes that are also exponentially stronger than our main characters. There is no quicker way to undermine a character's personal arc than by introducing another character who could snap his fingers and solve everything for them.\\n\\n\r\nThe second arc takes place in Sinbad's kingdom of Sindria, where our trio have decided to take the demigod-level king up on an offer to train and hone their abilities. Never mind that Alibaba's country was teetering on the brink of collapse when they finished the first arc! That's not important now! There's adventure afoot! \\n\\n\r\nThis series undermines itself so often that at this point I stopped caring and just kinda tuned out any of the dialogue. I became totally disengaged from the subject matter, and was just resigned to seeing this to its conclusion. I didn't miss much. Sinbad continued to faff about and allow the villains in the series to openly taunt him to his face, kill hundreds of innocents, and splash him with some kind of curse mark that turned half his face black, only for him to reverse the curse instantly in the season climax. \\n\\n\r\nSo why did he let himself get cursed? As he put it, \"to make Alibaba more motivated to clear the next dungeon\". Never mind that Alibaba himself has been afflicted by this same curse, which is actually a very real threat to his life or at least his sanity. Sinbad decides to fake sick so he can do nothing and shift the onus of \"saving him\" onto a blonde idiot, a blue-haired idiot, a traumatized former slave who does all the figurative and literal \"heavy lifting\" of the group, and a cowardly prince whose only real use is as a literal meat-shield.\\n\\n\r\nSo if the characters and story are disappointing every time you turn around, is the action any good? Well, there are quite a lot of fight scenes in Magi, and they're universally bland shounen-style nonsense, where whoever has the most plot-induced immortality will win. A lot of time is spent developing this complex and verbally dense system of magic, but it all boils down to brightly colored energy blasts and sword swings crashing into each other, with the good guys winning through the power of friendship (read: powers pulled straight out of their asses at the last possible second). What makes this more insulting is toward the end when abilities are plagiarized wholesale from Naruto and Fate Stay/Night.\\n\\n\r\nAnd thus we get to my next big issue with this series: the word \"subtlety\" is completely lost on the writers and animators. You can easily tell by a character's dress and method of speech whether they are good or evil. (Protip: good characters are attractive and smile a lot!) I couldn't tell if this series was aimed at children or adults. It pairs simplistic, heavy-handed morals that would fit on a poster in a kindergarten classroom with buckets of gore, complicated palace intrigue, and ecchi fanservice obviously intended for a more mature audience. In trying to appeal to both kids and adults, it makes itself inappropriate for the former and insults the intelligence of the latter. This is not how you do this.\\n\\n\r\nI had the misfortune of watching this dubbed, in which I got to hear a lot of high-profile English voice actors I had a lot of respect for embarrass themselves. The only bright spot in this is Cristina Vee as Morgiana, which also matches the fact that she's the only character I found myself able to care about. The sound design is perfunctory. There's nothing special in the sound effects or music to get you interested in what's going on, and the OPs and EDs are such forgettable tripe that I skipped them routinely.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some bright spots. Visually, the show is very bright and colorful, further selling me on the idea that this is trying to ingratiate itself to a wide audience. The character designs are unique and definitely inspired by Arabian folklore, which is definitely special as far as anime goes. The cityscapes are largely gorgeous when shown in wide-panning shots, although everything looks remarkably samey when the characters are wandering the streets.\\n\\n\r\nBut the greatest sin that Magi commits, more than anything that I've listed above, is just that it's a big long snore. There's no weight to the fighting scenes, and no real reason to care about the political stuff going on in the shadows. It is trite and unoriginal in every way except the setting. You can predict the events of every episode almost down to exact detail five minutes in. Please avoid this series if you value your time.\\n\\n\r\nUntil next time, Ko Empire bills are not accepted at this establishment.",

            "content": "So after much hype from compatriots of mine I finally decided to watch \"Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic\". My friends who have watched it previously loved it. Praised it even. It quickly become one of their favorite shows, and told me it was fantastic. So did their hype build this show up too high? or Did it achieve what I was told? Well a little of both.\r\nStory: 6\r\nA shounen if I've ever seen one. The story is the usually, a run of the mill group of hero's trying to overcome adversity, and fight against the big bad. It's a formula that most Anime under thisgenre follow, and that isn't really a bad thing. It's fun, and entertaining. It also has some much needed flare from the addition of using characters from the Arabian Night stories. Sadly being fun doesn't really make it fantastic. Yes I enjoyed my time in this world and enjoyed the adventure, but it just didn't do anything beyond the template. This isn't the worst shounen I've ever seen (I'm looking at you Naruto), but it certainly isn't the best. Besides being generic, it also was plagued with some pacing problems. Some of the arc's lasted way to long. I should also note the thick level of cheese in some of the more \"emotional\" scenes. The sound designer blared away a lot of the tragedy or serious nature of these scenes with some overbearing music (more on that later). \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\\n\r\nIt isn't gonna win any awards for it's art assets, but they were good for what it was. The show was filled with bright vibrant environments, and wonderfully designed characters. Some of the CG here and there was shotty, but besides that nothing to really complain about. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\\n\r\nUsually the OST to shows don't bug me. I either love them or just shrug, but this was pretty bad. Sometimes less is more, and I don't think the director understood that. When something serious or tragic is happening I want to be able to be taken by the moment. Usually music in any medium adds to the characters and the situation, but not here. For instance in one scene their was something that was meant to be really heartwarming and serious, but this freaking \"heroic\" trumpet comes in and smashed the scene all together. It was just over bearing, and made something sad into a cheese fest. The only reason that this score isn't much lower is because some tunes were alright, and the voice acting was fair. But my god I hate it when something takes me out of a story like that. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7\\n\\n\r\nQuite the lovely ensemble of heroes. Now I assume as the story continues this score will go up. Since this isn't the complete tale there are obviously some characters that aren't fully developed or realized. The ones that we currently have are all fairly enjoyable. Alibaba and Aladdin are fantastic. Oh and Sinbad is fabulous, and a God among men. I could use a little more from Morgiana, but she was still alright. Now for the main problem I had with the characters. The villains were so meh, besides the wonderful midriff Magi known as Judal they just didn't do much. I know they will probably go into more detail about them as the story moves forward, but as of right now the whole \"evil organization\" thing is pretty lame.     \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8 \\n\\n\r\nThe more I think about it the more I actually liked the show. Even tho some parts made me question \"why this arc was lasting 7 episodes?\" or turning to my brother and saying \"Yo look at that ass pull\" I still had a ton of fun. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6.6\\n\\n\r\nThough it wasn't as good as my friends made it out to be \"Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic\" was still a fun ride. If you like shounens then I suggest giving this one a shot. If they aren't really your thing, but are just looking for some fun in the Arabian sun then I would also say go for it. Although it had some short comings and pretty horrid sound track, Magi's loveable cast of characters and entertaining world help make this adventure one worth going on.",

            "content": "Magi is an anime that you've most likely seen before a million times unless you haven't seen anything in the medium. We have the family of tropes here! Everything from characters taking five minutes preparing a single punch only at the end to scream a ludicrous nickname such as \"Rebel Power Punch\" while the opponent stands still blinking at him to the power of friendship making everything better because friendship powers. \r\nMagi does all of these overused tropes quite well. For a fan of action centered anime, it is a fun watch. But there're two major things that bothered me. The obvious one is thediscrepancy between the tones the story goes through. At one moment, you'll see people cracking dumb jokes with cute imagery, but then two seconds later someone gets slashed in half. It's honestly quite jarring. \\n\\n\r\nEven though the show is rather short, it still feels that it went longer than it should've. I'll keep it at that to respect the spoiler policy. But regardless of those two things the show is an enjoyable watch, so if you like the usual magic, punching, friendship anime where friendship transforms you into mecha version of He-man then yeah go watch it.",

            "content": "I heard of this anime plenty of times, but never gave a bother to try it just by looking at the title picture, shame on me.\r\nFor Magi's genre (adventure/fantasy) I think it successfully filled those roles.\r\nStory 9/10:\r\nThe anime's about a boy named Aladdin who is joined by his friends Morgiana and Alibaba. The anime contains magical powers but is not centered only around magic. There is also sword fighters, along with fist fighters etc. I won't mention the \"plot\" because that's a spoiler, but the anime is sort of adventurous and in the settings of empires/conquerors. \r\n I very much enjoy settings where empires, kings,queens, princes and princesses exist. Not for the monarchy though, moreover, for the ability to conquer lands and the idea of warfare. The entire setting of the story, with modern day morals and an outdated century makes the story great. The idea of self government, world government, and dictatorships are portrayed very nicely. Although some people were expecting a story more similar to Aladdin's lamp, they were probably disappointed, but just because the anime doesn't relate to that story doesn't mean it's bad. It's an entire different series of its own so it should not be compared.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10: Art is pretty good, the quality is certainly better than some other anime. The colors show out the most, the character art is not bad, the magic is well done.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10: Average sound, sound effects are good, op/ed are also good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10: The characters are likable, there's many different types of characters which would appeal to viewers. Typical protagonist hero, but not as stereotypical as one would believe. Aladdin's sort of a clueless child, but not stupid which makes him likable. Personally, I really enjoy the presence of his friends Alibaba and Morgiana. Thankfully none of the characters hold in \"secrets\" like obvious secrets where the need to tell someone or bad things will happen. That annoys me greatly, when characters know they should obviously get help, but act as if by trying to treat themselves alone they won't hurt anyone.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10: The anime gets better as it progresses, I find the battle scenes very enjoyable. Keeps me on my toes wondering what'll happen. It's pretty flashy fight scenes to, sorta cool :).\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10:. I found it worthwhile to watch and entertaining. It may not be the best anime, yet it's certainly no where near the worst, and it is enjoyable as any other anime I'd recommend. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime fell off from the manga towards the end, I think it's fine to drift away from the manga, as long as the anime itself is good. Although the ending may have been disappointing to some, I'm curious to see what it'll bring in the second season. If the anime simply ended as it did, without a second season then perhaps my rating would change, but it did not. I do wish the story stayed with the manga, but hey things change and I'm not going to automatically assume \"wow anime destroyed good job\" without even giving it a shot. That's just ignorant. Keep in mind if the author of the manga finds it acceptable to deviate away from the manga in some episodes, then no one should be saying \"they screwed it all up\" since it didn't follow an exact plot line they desired to occur.",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)\r\nSomething that has bugged philosophers for generations is the idea of a little thing called \"destiny.\" Do we have control over our own fate? Is everything we do just predetermined, with the outcomes already an inevitability? It's a strange topic because in reality we don't fully know the answer. In Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic, the show would have you believe that while \"destiny\" may guide your path, you alone have the ability to change its course.\r\nSTORY\r\nM:L (what I'll be calling it from now on), begins with our star Alibaba having a chance encounter with Aladdin. Both boysdecide to work together in order to fulfill the dreams and goals that they each have.\\n\\n\r\nSomething that sets M:L apart from other shows is in its world building. Immediately, it enthralls you in this world that deals with magic, dungeons, and class systems. The setting is both fantastical and realistic. The former with its ideas about \"Rukh\" and Djinn, while the latter in its environments, people, and locations. This was something I really enjoyed, because not a lot of shows take place in such a strange time-period. It gave off an Egyptian vibe that worked quite well with the magical nature of the show.\\n\\n\r\nM:L is essentially split up into four arcs: character introduction arc, Aladdin's and Morgiana's arc, Cassim arc, and Sindria arc. Within each one, the show strikes a really nice balance between comedy and action. I often found myself laughing at Morg's rare cuteness and Aladdin's affinity for breasts. The action, likewise, was always pleasing to see. Watching two Metal Vessel users duke it out always provided for crazy acrobatics and smart strategy.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the show falters when it comes to the drama it instills. The majority of the time, the drama either lasts too long or is not properly executed in relation to the rest of the show. This becomes extremely noticeable during the Cassim arc. Personally, I found this portion of the show to be the weakest. It felt three or four episodes too long and detracted away from what the show does so well, namely the world building and action sequences. I wouldn't say it was melodramatic, because it does relate to what occurs later on and is important for certain characters growth-wise, but part of me feels that the drama itself was stretched out a bit too much.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nTaking place mostly across desert regions, you would think that M:L wouldn't have much leeway in terms of its visuals. Thankfully, this wasn't the case.\\n\\n\r\nThe show uses a pretty expansive color palate, not only with the characters' hair but also with their designs and the actual environments. The show mostly takes place within city-states in Egyptian landscapes, so it mostly sticks to beige, brown, and clay-red for its buildings and roads. At the same time though, the show looks to always inject color in all the right places.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to actual animation, I found it to be above average. While the show does incur quite a bit of dialogue, when it comes to the action pieces, it really doesn't hold back. From Alibaba's self-engulfing flames to Morg's crazy parkour fighting style, there is always something moving about on-screen.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are also pretty unique. There are a lot of minor characters, but even they look vastly different when compared to one another. With such a large cast, it can be difficult sometimes to remember every single name, so their appearances matter greatly. In this case, M:L does a fantastic job in making every single one, from the good guys to the bad guys, look and feel different.\\n\\n\r\nOne final note is the way in which some of the characters smile. The animators chose to draw some characters' upper teeth when they smile. I actually liked this little addition because it seemed more natural for a wide-grin. Nothing amazing, but a nice little touch!\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nArguably M:L's weakest part is its characters.\\n\\n\r\nLet's start off with the bad. Surprisingly, my least favorite character in the show is Alibaba. What's interesting is that the show takes considerable time in developing his background and who he actually is as a person. But the trouble comes in what they actually do with it. Many of the issues that the characters' face during their journey are a result of Alibaba's decision making. My issue is that, despite the things he's heard and learned alongside Aladdin and the others, he constantly is making poor choices. Meaning, he never truly grows as a character and instead regresses before he can progress. It gets rather annoying to see this, and as such, I found his character to be rather unlikable.\\n\\n\r\nSinbad is another character I actually didn't like, or perhaps it's better to say that the show prevented me from liking or even disliking him. It's clear when we first see him that he is quite the strong and persuasive person. But that's it. While he sticks around for the entire second half of the season, we never really learn anything about him. Sure, they show off some of his skills, but we don't know what his goals are, who he is deep down, and why we should care for him at all. I felt that M:L dropped the ball when it came to his character because he was constantly put on such a high pedestal.\\n\\n\r\nSwitching gears, one of my favorite characters in the show is easily Aladdin. Bright, optimistic, and full of life, he is always looking out for and cheering on others, especially Alibaba. His origin still remains a mystery, but the show gives us nice insight as to who Aladdin really is and the purpose he serves in the overall narrative. He's a fun character not only to watch and listen to, but also to learn from, because the viewer is always learning right along with him.\\n\\n\r\nMy favorite character from the show is hands-down Morgiana. Loyal, loving, and wicked-strong, she is one of the most interesting simply due to her original predicament. While she adores working together with Alibaba and Aladdin, her personal struggles are her true defining features. While it takes time for her to acclimate to the differing situations that she is thrust into, you can always expect to see her making you smile, saving her friends, and otherwise presenting you with a really good time.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe first OP for M:L is pretty darn good. The tempo and especially the singer create a nice mix of \"sweeping\" sounds that fits the tone of the show perfectly. The second OP doesn't come close to how good the first is. It tries to be more grand in both the singing and instruments, but it just doesn't fit well with the way in which the show presents itself.\\n\\n\r\nThe first ED is actually interesting. As a standalone song it is pretty good, but honestly speaking, it doesn't really have a place in the show. It's almost too upbeat in relation to the show. M:L is definitely happy and carefree during certain segments, but never on this level. The second ED suffers the same fate as the second OP, in that it is just not good. It's too generic and guitar-filled and doesn't mesh well with the rest of the show.\\n\\n\r\nAt this point, I just want to point out that the first OP's and first ED's visuals are the most misleading visuals for an opening and ending song that I have ever seen. I don't know if the studio should be commended or not for this, but it is kind of strange how irrelevant a lot of what they show in both of them really are.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the soundtrack is pretty darn good as well. Sticking with the Egyptian vibe, the show sticks heavily to that type of music, with flutes and drums galore.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of voice acting, the show does an average job in this regard. No character's were extremely standout, but there were no issues in each of their respective roles.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nAnime gives us the opportunity to see things that we normally can't. This is especially true when it comes to the worlds that they present. In this case, M:L did a wonderful job in making me not only aware of the world but also really care for it. Its unique setting (relative to anime) makes it very fun to watch because nothing else is really like it.\\n\\n\r\nThe show's comedy mostly sticks to the way in which characters act in a certain situation, and for the most part, I always found these bits pretty funny. The hints of romance were also duly noted and appreciated. And as far as the fights go, I actually quite liked them. Some were large in scale, some were one on one, but they all had nice detail and varied move-sets that made each one a pleasure to watch.\\n\\n\r\nI found myself really wanting to see what was going to happen next. But if there is one gripe that I had, it was the overuse of \"convenient\" plot points. Not wanting to spoil anything, I will say at the minimum that certain things happen rather conveniently during the story's progression. So many times, in fact, that you start to anticipate the next time it is going to happen.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic is a show that does many things right with a few missteps along the way. Hopefully the second season can improve upon its weaknesses and truly stand among the best of the best.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Good, unique world, cool action, but elongated drama\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Great, nice visuals, interesting settings, and well done actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Fine, Alibaba is bad yet offset by the good that is Morgiana and Aladdin\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good, first OP and ED are leagues better than the seconds, nice soundtrack, average VAs\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good, interesting and fun with only minor issues to complain about\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 7/10",

            "content": "-\r\nThis is the script for my video-review of the show over on youtube, so if you don't wanna read it, listen to me talk about it!\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nn7Wk9_TudM\r\n-\r\nMagi is a shounen fantasy adventure, but this time, it's one borrowing not only themes from the arabian one-thousand and one nights, but many other countries as well! \r\nIt is based on an ongoing manga by author Ohtaka Shinobu and was adapted as 2 TV series spanning 25 episodes each. \r\nThe adaptation by A1-Pictures contains the first 110 chapters of the manga, staying mostly true to the source material, was directed by Masunari Koji and aired in Fall 2012.\r\nIn Magi'sworld, several so-called dungeons appeared throughout the lands years ago. \\n\r\nFilled with tons of treasures and magic items, the strongest being \"djinn vessels\", many young adventurers tried to conquer them, with only a handful of the strongest ever returning alive. \\n\r\nIn the desert city of Quichan, our protagonist Alibaba works hard earning enough money to one day conquer the local dungeon \"Amon\", fulfilling his wish of becoming rich. \\n\r\nHere, he meets the young and mysterious boy Aladdin, who doesn't understand how the world works and therefore gets Alibaba in all kinds of trouble with his boss, all while having to swallow his pride. \\n\r\nWhen an accident happens while transporting wine to another city and a big desert monster threatens to eat a child alive, Aladdin gets impressed by Alibaba, who can't just stand by and watch. \\n\r\nThe two of them then decide to venture into the unknown, as they are responsible for the loss of the wine and in big debt, and go to conquer Amon!\\n\\n\r\nFrom the beginning on, the series shows us that Alibaba isn't your usual shounen protagonist who's just brawns and no brains, as he knows what he has to do and seems knowledgable in a few uncommon territories, recognizing the monster in the desert or being able to decypher a foreign language. \\n\r\nThe anime's third arc, which focuses more on his background, makes perfect sense of all this and places Alibaba somewhere far up near the top when talking about good shounen characters.\\n\\n\r\nAladdin on the other hand stays mysterious for a long time, and while he isn't a well-rounded character from the beginning, he gets to learn quite a lot from the people he meets and has pretty good reasoning, even though many of his actions only motivation is \"For my friend Alibaba!\"\\n\\n\r\nThen there's Morgiana, a red-haired slave girl from the very strong, southern tribe called \"Fanalis\", designwise seemingly inspired by the egyptians. She is hands-down the best thing in existence. \\n\r\nWhile the show is generally missing a few good female characters, Morgiana would take the place of best girl no matter how perfect the others could be! JUST LOOK AT THAT FACE!\\n\r\nIn the beginning, she follows our male protagonists only out of thankfulness for freeing her, but soon, she evolves into their friend, making these 3 characters a really good team.\\n\\n\r\nAs for other important characters, there's Sinbad, also called \"Sinworst\", which is true. \\n\r\nHe's introduced as a pretty laid-back, but powerful man, having conquered not one, but seven dungeons in his life-time. \\n\r\nHe's not having that much of a formed character during this season, but he is more important for the future of the franchise.\\n\\n\r\nSimilarily, Judar, a black-haired mage working for Kou, a big empire in the east inspired by chinese history, seems like a normal \"bad guy\", but does have some signs of there being a reason for why he is how he is.\\n\\n\r\nHakuryuu, a prince of that Kou empire, is important for the future of the series as well, but already has relevance in the second half of the first season, where he's getting a decent character, not on the level of Alibaba and Aladdin, but by far enough to impress me.\\n\\n\r\nThe secondary characters sadly go nowhere out of the ordinary, with the only ones worth mentioning for me being the grandmother of the Kouga tribe and Hakuryuu's sister, Hakuei. \\n\r\nThe first serving as a mentor for Aladdin, teaching him what life means and how you have to deal with putting your life on the line in a fight. \\n\r\nThe later mostly introducing the Kou empire and showing that it isn't full of bad people and that their goal isn't just to conquer the world, but to actually unify it and create one peaceful country. \\n\r\nThe several antagonists introduced in each arc have some reasoning behind their actions, but are generally more mid-tier, but the important ones are really not bad characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is really the thing that makes me completely disappointed of the adaptation. \\n\r\nThe quality drops so hard that the second half wasn't really enjoyable anymore, and after having read the manga, I wanted to watch the show just to see Morgiana dance. \\n\r\nYes, I am salty because it didn't look like shown in the second opening, but still, the animation has no positive points, and except for a few scenes, the first half doesn't stand out either.\\n\r\nThe actual artstyle though is kinda interesting, as the different influences are really fun to see and observe. \\n\r\nIt ranges from the already mentioned \"1001 nights\" and imperial chinese over to the mongolian plains, where the Kouga clan lives. \\n\r\nAnd Sindria is apparently based on India.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the character designs, I can just say that  -quote- \"all the characters are cute\"  -quote end-. \\n\r\nNo seriously, like the world, the characters with their different nationalities are all interesting enough to make me want to see more. \\n\r\nAnd Morgiana is cute. \\n\r\nNo objection accepted!\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack centers mostly around the thematic of  \"1001 nights\", with most songs straying a bit in different directions, which is interesting, and there are definetly a few in there I listen to outside of the show.\\n\r\nIf I had to mention my favorites, they'd be #1 - \"Enfin Apparu\", #6 - \"Faut il Saver\" and #13 - \"Valse Hot\".\\n\\n\r\nThen there's the voice acting, in which my second big problem with the show lies, even though it is heavily influenced by my knowledge of the manga. \\n\r\nIt makes perfect sense to let a woman voice the 10 year old Aladdin, but it just quickly doesn't feel right anymore, with him soon stopping to act like a kid and his appearance remaining the only childish feature he has. \\n\r\nThe other characters fit their voices pretty well, so I won't complain about any of them.\\n\\n\r\nI've been saying \"For the future\" a lot in this review, so I'll need to get this out of the way. \\n\r\nThe show is not finished, but the manga just entered its final arc not too long ago and I predict the announcement of a third season towards its final stretch. \\n\r\nThis may take a few more years, I'll just unknowingly throw \"Summer 2017\" in the room, but keep in mind, I don't know any more about this than the next person.\\n\\n\r\nNow, that's it, but is \u201eMagi: The Labyrinth of Magic\u201c worth the watch?\\n\\n\r\nThe thing is: You should give the franchise a chance!\\n\r\nIf you like manga, I'd actually prefer to recommend you  giving that one a read. \\n\r\nIf you don't want to read the manga, try watching the anime. \\n\r\nI can't say the show is good, especially because of the problems in animation, but I dare say the story and characters are on par with something like Fullmetal Alchemist, which is commonly reffered to as a masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nSo to sum it up with one simple question: \\n\r\nWould you watch Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, if the animation sucked? \\n\r\nIf your answer is yes, then go watch Magi, if the answer is no, give the manga a read! \\n\r\nIf you don't want to read the manga, definetly go for the anime, you'll just have to sit through the enjoyment-killing parts.\\n",

            "content": "I just finished this anime and I'm breathless. It is amazing. \r\nStory 9/10\r\nMagi has unique Arabian setting, with on characters from 1001 Nights. In short, it is about a young magi Aladdin and his chosen king's candidate Alibaba along with a former slave Morgiana developing their power while traveling to different places. A lot of things comes their way but they make a lot of friends and allies as well.\r\nThe concept of magic (magoi) here is interesting. It comes from the nature, and goes back to the nature when we dies. I can accept the logic. The dungeon and djinn are well thought and hadnever been brought up before in other anime, I find it makes this anime unique.\\n\\n\r\nWhile it brings typical issues like bad guys vs good guys, they address it in such a way that makes us wonder about what we think is right. People have their own goals, but the way they achieve it may be harmful to others or helpful. Magi reminds me of this. \\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\r\nRegarding Art, I'm not just talking about character design. The character designs are very colorful, stands out and memorable. The characters from Balbadd and Sindria have clothing suitable with the Arabian theme while the characters from Kou Empire have touches of oriental / East Asian feel, making it easier to recognize who is who. \\n\\n\r\nThe background and sceneries are fantastically done with eye-pleasing color palettes and amazing details, I feel is one of the best works from A-1 Pictures. The animation and visual effects is also considered fluid for that year, especially the magoi, battle scenes and facial expression.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10\\n\r\nWe will meet with names we are familiar with like Aladdin, Alibaba, Morgiana, and Sinbad. However, the characters are different from their original Arabian story. In my opinion, Magi has very well developed character. Each of them has interesting back stories (even the bad guys like Judar and Cassim) that make you understand why they do things and their reasons make you sympathize with them. In addition, the seiyuus who voice them are top notch and did great job!\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\r\nI am not really a fan of the openings and endings except The Bravery, but it is memorable. Some of the rock BGM by Shiro Sagisu did increase the tension during fights but I caught the same song being played again and again.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\r\nAlthough I have watched a lot of anime with shounen genre, I bet this is one of those I will remember. I enjoyed a lot of fun and squealed a lot too (yeap, to Aladdin's cuteness, Alibaba's resolve, Morgiana badass moments and of course Hakuryu)\\n\\n\r\nSome people who read the manga complains that it is too short, yeah although I didn't read the manga I feel the last few episodes indeed feel rushed. Aside from that, the pacing in Magi is nice, relaxing and funny, then tense and exciting during battles and wars. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I like Magi and recommend this to you who like fantasy anime with magic and battles which is not too long, while still maintaining good story and characters with depth.",

            "content": "When i think Magi, i think action and comedy perfectly blended in together into one beautifully presented adventure. Not only did magi has stunning visuals and amazing choreography in fights, but the voice acting also seemed perfect, requiring no time to \"get used to their voices\" like some dubs and subs have. Now to preface i did watch magi in sub (don't even know if there is a dub) and let me tell you i could close my eyes and fall asleep to those damn voices man. Casting was near perfect with only a few moments where i thought (his voice doesn't really fit thatcharacters look). Now if you want to know my absolute opinion feel free to check the conclusion down at the bottom.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\r\nThe story in Magi is on par with those that are claimed to be the greats. It's essentially about a kid who is called the Magi, Magi are \"Magicians that shape the world\". By using Magoi (the power created from harnessing Rukh), they are able to control these Rukhs that come naturally from the earth. Magi have the power to summon Dungeons, and to lead people in there. Magi bestow the magical items found in Dungeons to the people he leads. This essentially means that Aladdin is the center character with \"side kicks\" however don't go into this anime expecting the show to be completely centered around Aladdin with no character development for the others. All the characters in the story are fully fleshed out and are not in anyway neglected. As far as the story's fluency goes it proceeds from event to event in such a way that if feels normal, nothing feels too rushed and nothing feels like its being dragged on for way too long and each event feels like it has a purpose and develops each character thoroughly.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nWhat is there to say? The visuals are absolutely stunning, the art design was very Egyptian style. There are two predominate styles of art here in Magi, the first style is the usual art where the characters are shaped normally and everything is fabulous. Then there's the art style that's normally shown in times of comedy where all the characters bodies are 2d and have an extreme amount of emphasis on how their feeling for example if Aladdin is happy he will turn into a squishy ball as he rubs up against the boobs of a random citizen. The lighting and clarity are an amazing selling point for magi as well. Everything seems to be where it should be, flickering fire torches reflect on their clothing in real time. The background in Magi is also extensively done, there was no lack of effort when it came to putting in detail into the background. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nMy god did Shir\u014d Sagisu NAIL THE MUSIC. To give you some context Sagisu is the composer for Magi, you may know some of his work as he was the composer for most noticeably Neon Genesis Evangelion, Bleach and more recently Black Bullet. Now i will say this now if you want a soundtrack that includes music that displays the characters emotions you may not be too satisfied with this OST. This soundtrack targets the scenes and emotions of the overall context, this means no slow and sombre music unless the scene calls for it, not the character. This by no means is to hammer on Sagisu's music. He captures the feeling of battle perfect with such tracks as \"Enfin Apparu\", \"Valse hot\" and for a more situational feel of \"Notre empire\". Sagisu nails the music and i tell you right now when i was done with Magi i instantly downloaded the OST onto my computer and still listen to it this day.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\r\nAs i previously discussed in the story section all the characters in this show are fully fleshed out and on top of that no one feels like they have been ripped out of your typical shounen genre and made into a strict character archetype. Now this means that your not gonna be sitting there thinking \"This character's only purpose is so the show can have that specific archetype\" instead you'll be thinking about that characters reason for being in the show (and trust me they flesh out everyone's reasoning as to why they are in the show). Each character has their specific morals and emotions that clearly separates them from each other and also clearly shows why they act the way they do. The design of each character is perfectly don't as well as the symbolism in each character such as their hair. All in all i thoroughly enjoyed the ways the characters interacted with each other and easily got emotionally attached to each character to the point where i would be on the edge of my seat every time they were exposed to danger.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nOk so lets make this clear, if i could be bias and list things off my personal enjoyment i would give everything in this anime a 10. Unfortunately this would be a crappy review if all i said was \"THIS ANIME IS F@#KING LEGENDARY\". But when i really think about it, i can't really be specific about my personal enjoyment. Absolutely everything about this anime made me when to go on google and look at everything i could, go on youtube and listen to everything i could, talk to friends to debate about everything i could. This anime sparked so much enjoyment out of me from the perfectly crafted action scenes and the perfectly placed humor that made me thoroughly enjoy everything this anime had to offer.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9.5/10\\n\r\nOk so maybe i tend to over rate anime based on my emotions but so what! If your like me and have emotions that outweigh logic than you'll look past all the flaws of this anime and be absorbed by its brilliance. I fully recommend watching this anime as it will pull you away from all the slice of life and romance and really give you something to watch and be in awe of.",

            "content": "Magi: the labyrinth of Magic's first few episodes were pretty good; it was cute, funny, charming and awesome. Sadly, it didn't stayed like that for the whole series. For the first half of the series, 1-13 was at pretty watchable. The second half was the main weak point of the anime; all those cute and funny moments disappeared on the second half (14-25), and the ending wasn't that great. Though, it was a happy ending, but still, it was a crappy happy ending. \r\nStory? Story is pretty good, Aladdin, a Magi meets a young boy, Ali Baba an  Aladdin helps him fulfils one ofhis dreams; completing a dungeon. Then comes my favourite character in the anime, Morgiana. After completing the dungeon, she was set free from slavery with the help of Aladdin and Ali Baba. After all that dungeon-exploring in the first few episodes, Aladdin soon goes alone into different territories and the main topic of discussion was, War. War always sprouted from hatred. War is main topic of the entire series. Though, most of the excitement starts fading away when it was in the Balbadd arc; it's not bad, but it's at least, watchable. \\n\\n\r\nMain focus in the Balbadd arc was Ali Baba and his friend Kassim. Flashbacks start appearing in the series, Ali Baba's and Kassim's past begins to unravel. These flashbacks weren't too bad, I found it pretty interesting to watch. The action scenes in this arc becomes a pretty boring. Surprisingly, there was a filler episode about Sinbad and one of the Princesses of Kou somewhere later in the series; and yes, it was pretty boring, and most importantly, pointless. I think, the whole story of the anime strayed far off from the manga's point of view somewhere in episode 20, or probably even earlier than that.\\n\\n\r\nA-1 Pictures is starting to make a name for itself(or they already had) for making terrible original endings. First anime I've watched from the same studio (as far as I can remember), was Ao no Exorcist, and yes it had a lot of potential to become a great anime, though its biggest flaw is its ending.  The studio's biggest mistake has always been the same: starts off good in the first half, terrible second half, then accompanied with a terrible original anime ending. What happened to Ao no Exorcist, also happened to Magi - Labyrinth of Magic. I guess, history really does repeat itself.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters? Magi uses characters from the Arabian nights, making them look more awesome than the actual person from the stories. For example, take a look at Ali Baba in the original Ali Baba and the forty thieves tale. and try comparing it to the Ali Baba in the anime. Look how they awesome they become. My favourite character is Morgiana, a tough chick. First 20 episodes, I watched Magi because of the plot. Then after that, I felt that the plot became somewhat rushed and strayed off from the Manga. So in the later episodes, I watched Magi mainly just because of Morgiana. Also, Aladdin and Ali Baba are both likeable main characters. \\n\\n\r\nSound? The opening and Ending theme were so-so, and the voice-acting were pretty awesome. But the background music was very epic, especially during the fighting scenes. \\n\\n\r\nVisual? Though, its visuals are pretty good, but not always. The quality of visuals sometimes end up looking pretty bad, where characters faces look somewhat different. But overall visuals are decent.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion? Though, I find Magi to be very awesome in the earlier episodes but somewhat boring in the later episodes, so I find it a little difficult for who recommend it to. obviously enough, if you like prefer the shounen/action genre, Magi is definitely a good choice. Though, it's definitely not recommended for everyone.",

            "content": "Initial Review for Newcomers: Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic is loosely based on One Thousand and One Nights (more commonly known as Arabian Nights). A boy named Aladdin has been bestowed with great power and with his friends, he will help save/protect the world. Over the course of their adventure, they encounter treasures, magic, women and... social and political injustices. Over the course of this anime, dark themes of slavery, poverty, corruption and war occur. This anime expresses these themes in a similar fashion to another well known show (Yes, I'm referring to Avatar: The Last Airbender; although Avatar's dark themes are lightly touched andmore war oriented).\\n\\n\r\nDub or Sub?: Either one, though I would recommend the sub. The dub is watchable (not bad but not good either) but I didn't find Aladdin's voice to be childlike enough. Alibaba's voice sounded a bit effeminate the first time I heard it. Morgiana's voice was good. Sinbad's voice matched up pretty well. There was also one character whose voice didn't match up at all but I forgot his name. All things considered, the dub is watchable, with minor problems. The sub was superb, I found very little problems with the Japanese cast.\\n\\n\r\nStory (8/10): The story of Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic focuses on Aladdin and his friends Alibaba and Morgiana. The show starts off simple enough, Aladdin and his (future) friends go on a perilous quest to seek their fortune. Eventually, they will face dark challenges on the their journey. An interesting aspect of the story is the addition of war and politics. This becomes more apparent as the story progresses with the introduction of Sinbad, the country of Balbadd and the ongoings of the Kou Empire.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8/10): The show borrows several character elements from its source material. The three protagonists, Aladdin, Alibaba and Morgiana each retain several traits in common with their original counterparts. The same goes for other characters like Sinbad, Cassim and Scheherazade (we'll see her later in the second season).\\n\\n\r\nAladdin is an innocent child. His interactions with others shows his naivet\u00e9. His personality is wise and he always tries to find non-violent solutions problematic situations. For the most part, he tries to see the best in people and adds a lot of emotion to the story.\\n\r\nSide note: I think the creators of the show should have toned down his perverted behavior.\\n\\n\r\nAlibaba is a na\u00efve idealist.  His reasons are there but the execution of said reasons prove to be difficult (without help from others). This is very apparent when his backstory and life choices are shown in the Fog Troupe Arc.\\n\\n\r\nMorgiana is a strong, independent woman. Like Alibaba, she is portrayed as na\u00efve (primarily due to her enslavement) but she is also strong willed. Her personality develops very well throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nSupporting Characters: There is a lot of supporting characters. Each one of them have unique personalities and perspectives that really help move the story. Most of them have enough backstory/development to become a main character (FYI, they made a spin-off starring Sinbad).\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation (10/10): The art/animation is modern. The backgrounds are very detailed and colored brightly. The same goes for any battle scenes that take place; the animation is very fluid.\\n\\n\r\nSound/Music (9.5/10): The sound/music was good. The opening theme music was Middle Eastern-esque and was exciting and upbeat. The soundtrack over the adventure and battles were really enjoyable too. My only concern was the ending theme. It just doesn't seem to go with the show as an ending theme.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10): I enjoyed it. By the end of the first season, I wanted to see more.\\n\\n\r\nSummary/Overall (8/10): The story was good and exciting. The character development is excellent. The music is also very good. The amount of satisfaction after watching this is high.\\n\\n\r\nReview #11",

            "content": "Magi is certainly not the best shonen anime ever made, but it is certainly enjoyable.\r\nThe primary selling point, especially in the first half of the show, is definitely the setting and cultural aesthetic. Magi showcases lands inspired by various middle eastern and asian cultures, primarily those of historical Islam and China. The show establishes itself as separate fantasy world, so keep in mind that it is not trying to be historically accurate despite the inspiration from \"1001 Nights.\"\r\nThe animation is bright and colorful which compliments the fantastical settings, powers, and more outwardly cute art style. In addition, most of the character designs are neat andmemorable; standouts include Hakuryuu, Judal, Sinbad, and his eight generals. The only aspect about the style that was irksome was that the characters' faces tended to be homogenous, with both male and female characters based on the same model. Voice alone seems to determine gender, and hair style and eye color determine identity. Of course, these trends are nothing new in anime, but the frequency of their occurrence makes it jarring, nontheless. (Notable exceptions include Sinbad and a couple members of his posse, but that's about it).\\n\\n\r\nThe actual story was decent enough, but nothing groundbreaking. It seemed to meander, but I suppose it's composed of arcs, however small and loosely defined. Magi doesn't really pick up until the last fourth of the show, which is problematic from a plot and pacing standpoint. However, the world, powers, and characters are good enough to carry the show on its own. Even when the show attempts a large-scale plot, it is ultimately the characters that make it worth watching. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of which, Alibaba is adorable and a protagonist worth rooting for, and Aladdin's draw is how he is often wise beyond his years. However, the perverted boob jokes involving Aladdin definitely detract from the integrity of the character. Honestly, most of the chibi comic relief in Magi just seems strange and out of place. The third protagonist is Morgiana, a former slave girl and definitely the weakest of the main trio (in regard to personality and character; she is definitely physically stronger than the other two). She is just simply uninteresting. Now, the show does go to great lengths to flesh out her development, but it means nothing if the character is uninteresting to watch. Unfortunately, it just makes the development seem contrived. \\n\\n\r\nSinbad is by far the most charismatic and appealing character, and all of his generals are equally so. It's a pity that we didn't see more from them, as small bits of information about their backstories and personalities caught my attention. Sinbad definitely delivered from a character standpoint, but we didn't see enough of him fighting with his djinn equip powers, which is just odd considering that his dungeon capturing adventures and resulting numerous amount of djinn vessels are kind of his claim to fame. Also, there was a startling reveal about him in the last episode, but of course there was no time for the show to go into that. I hope that the second season explores Sinbad and his generals' developments more.\\n\\n\r\nAll of the conflicts in Magi are sorted into black and white, often literally! This is certainly the show's biggest, most glaring problem . The rukh (essentially glowing spirit butterflies) are labelled as a force of good while the reverse \"black\" rukh are only seen as evil. Which is strange, as the black rukh only make people fall into \"depravity.\" It is natural for a person to have moments of moral lapse, pining for revenge, feeling angry, greedy, etc., so it seems odd to just rule these feelings off as evil, especially to the point where feeling any of these in a small amount essentially leads to magical self destruction.\\n\\n\r\nIn summary, Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic is colorfully animated with rich and diverse settings, characters, and powers. However, don't expect anything too groundbreaking in terms of story and quell any hopes for moral ambiguity.",

Despite, its cutesie like appearance, Magi actually takes the show on a slightly darker path than expected, thus leaving the watcher surprised and wanting more. Magi follows the journey of young Aladdin, and his friends Alibaba and Morgiana, as he tries to figure out who and what he is, all the while making new friends and stumbling into magical battles. You can\u2019t helpbut fall in love with the story line and the characters (even the one on the opposing side). It\u2019s imagery, character development, and fight sequences have your jaw dropping and heart squealing in happiness as your favorite characters save the day and transform into total bad asses. Magi also has a way of forcing the viewers to fall in love with every single character and understand the meaning behind every single action, even if that action is to destroy the world and kill innocent people. The way each character\u2019s background is presented have you wishing for their redemption instead of their demise. It\u2019s one of those anime\u2019s that doesn\u2019t believe in things such as \u201cbad\u201d and \u201cgood\u201d rather it focuses on telling everyone\u2019s struggle and strife to the point where you can\u2019t help but relate to them and agree/not agree with their methods but still hope for their success. So if you\u2019re looking for something cute, dangerous, new, and exciting then Magi is definitely the anime for you\\n\\n",

            "content": "Only saw the first season of Magi, which is the labyrinth of magic. I had many thoughts while watching this.... and I wished to share them with y'all. Hopefully this will entice you to watch the show, as it had for me. I have no doubt that this will be a great watch for you if you can connect with it, and if not, then it is at least an enjoyable and solid watch. So, moving on, here are the thoughts I had while watching this show.\r\nAll throughout the show I couldn't help but feel as though they actually had a plot.... Magi, using thepower of the rukh which are the spirits of the people. When I had heard this, I couldn't but feel as though this had a meaning behind it. It had a solid explanation and one I could connect with. Usually I would like to explain how I could connect to this, but on a personal basis, and on a more subconscious basis, I cannot explain how. When you watch Magi you will know if you had connected to it or not.\\n\\n\r\nThis show also had a very adventurous spirit to it, it wasn't episodic, it followed one story one path and had that adventurous feel to it. Some things are indeed explained but can be easily overlooked when you are caught up in the joy ride of Magi. It's a solid watch for anyone who has no interest in some of the things that Magi talks about. And about that... I had connected to those beliefs on a deep level, and I would like to share this with anybody. For those who are willing to watch this, this story will be an amazement to how deeply it talks about its subject (trying to keep as little spoilers as possible). \\n\\n\r\nThe fighting had a solid feel to it, and you felt as though anybody wasn't obviously stronger than the other. To put into more precise terms, everyone has their own specialty. Of course there are those that are flat out stronger, however, it feels as though everyone has their own specialty, and no one's simply \"Weak.\" \\n\\n\r\nI would like to bring up this point, I wish to get this across. This show brings up some very deep and serious topics. You relate this show to a slice-of-life romance drama anime and it feels as though their problems are almost petty compared to those in this show. You can tell that these are things anyone could easily fall into it if given the same circumstances... When you connect with this show, you'll start to feel yourself choke up at some points (at least for me I did). You can understand their pain and reasoning and it's not very hard to interpret. Fate, destiny, to curse it and say screw it all. Magi is a show not to be simply taken lightly, it talks about many serious topics that go on a spiritual level and on a subconscious level. And even if you don't connect with this show, if you enjoy anime, you will definitely enjoy Magi.\\n\\n\r\nPS: The music choice was very bad at some points.... This was a reaccuring thought all throughout my watch with Magi and I couldn't help but say it at these last few moments. However the music alone was very nice to listen to, like the openings and endings. There were some plot holes, the character development and plot development were great, the story had an adventurous feel. The story was not jacked up as \"IM OVERPOWERED TIME TO WRECK YOU ALL!\" But it actually felt as though there was development in it. You can connect to the characters and feel their pain and understand their circumstances. This was a very enjoyable watch... I hope you all enjoy.",

            "content": "First of all I didn't expect anything from this anime. As I read the description I thought \" not another anime, show, movie, about fair tales... who wants to see this .... \" But due to the lack of any good anime and thanks to a nice review I've read, I thought I will give it a try. \r\nSo I got hooked right away. \r\nAfter the first minutes I wasn't sure yet if it was a childish anime or if it was made for a broader audience. After watching 12 epsiodes I can tell you its for a broader audience, so no worries!\r\nStory:\r\nLet me tellyou, its not 1001 nights as the description states. Its an anime which is set in ancient times (actually bit later propably in 1200..). Magi borrows names and phrases from various known stories like 1001 nights for example.\\n\r\nBut this Anime has nothing to do with 1001 nights, only because the names are the same doesn't mean anything. So if you don't like simple fairy tales, dont worry this is all about a fantasy world in post-ancient times with a lot of magic. It also borrows things from other mythologies like Celtic mythology, Chinese mythology..etc.\\n\\n\r\nThe Story takes place in a time of chaos and where war ravages and the spirit of revolution is in the air. Where magic has awoken anew. Magic created dungeons all over the world. By conquering those dungeons you can get immense powers. New kings get crowned, people stand up for their rights and people go on adventures.\\n\r\nIn this world the main protagonists; Aladadin, Alibaba and Morgiana; try to find their own ways and try to take part in these historic times. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nI think all characters are nice and you will get fond of them very easily. There are three main characters, which are very well done. Their development is not exaggerated and not underdeveloped. The characters have time to change but they stay true to their key elements. Even though there might be various anime cliches form time to time above all as Alibabas character design is considered, but the anime never got consumed too much into any anime cliches. Actually when you are at the brink of thinkin that this anime turned into another boring \"Emo\" cliched anime, it doesnt fail to turn the tables and get you hooked even more. \\n\\n\r\nArt+ Sound:\\n\r\nI like the art very much, also how they portray the emotions of the characters, It makes you laugh sometimes and gives the anime a unique flair. The sound is nothing noticeable tho...\\n\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this Anime is really worth watching. It reminds me of those old epic anime I loved so much, and why I started watching Anime in the first place. But it only reminds me of if! It hasnt conquered my heart fully yet, Ive only seen 12 episodes so far there is still a lot of space above this anime and beneath it. I gave it 10 points filled with a lot of hope that it doesn't disappoint me after those 12 nice episodes. ;)",

            "content": "From someone who has watched countless shounen, it becomes typical to  look at a show labelled \"shounen\", and dismiss it as mundane and cliche. But with every new addition to this vast genre, there are always shows/manga that stick out more than others. \nThankfully, Magi does this.\nStory: (9/10) With a setting based on Arabian Nights, you can expect (or at least hope for), a gripping narrative. Thankfully, Magi is structured so that the focus on the two main protagonists (Alibaba and Aladdin) is well orchestrated, and has a unique vibe to it. Through this, the story can become very dark and gripping, while notlosing the narrative. What differentiates this from other shounen is the political aspect. As a king, you must reign. But how will you do it? Through this question the different nations and factions can interact in a believable environment, without it ever feeling like the author is asking you to pretend they would do that.\\n\\n\nArt: (8/10) Most shounens typically fall under long broadcasting widths. While this allows for a developed story, the art tends to suffer long-term. Thankfully the animators have cut the show into a one season arc, while providing room to adapt more chapters if need be. For this reason, the art is well developed. Backgrounds are detailed and varied, with character models being round and developed. There are few jagged edges apparent, which helps realism. The battle scenes don't suffer with still shots (too much), and motion does not degrade the animation. It stays fluid throughout, with the exception of the comedy scenes. Through these, the show takes a different animation style. While humorous in a way, it detracts from the overall value. I don't see the joke through their expressions, but rather, through the goofy way they're drawn.\\n\\n\nSound: (9/10) One of Magi's strong points. Both openings provide a gateway into Arabia, with a melody and vocalist that resemble the middle eastern style. It opens the door to the show, making the transition to background music worthwhile. With this, you experience a variety of festival soundtracks, battle hymns, and adventure tunes. The depth and well execution of sound makes for a more enjoyable watch. This is followed by the endings which slightly devalue the soundtrack. While not bad, they don't carry the show to the end. Had they been chosen better, the desire to continue watching would have been more apparent.\\n\\n\nCharacters: (10/10) The characters in a show must be well rounded for the plot to work. No matter how great a set piece, it won't work without strong protagonists. And Magi delivers. Alibabba is a naive individual with to much idealism. This pushes the plot forward. Aladdin is a childish yet strangely deep character. His character shifts add emotion to the story. Morgiana is the strong, shackled female who can offer great moments through her actions. This trio has a well-blended bond that works. Their conversations kept me through the show, eager to see how they will handle future situations. The background characters, of which there are to many to name, are stunning. They have unique personalities, and offer believable lines that push the narrative further. Each new individual can hold their own as a main character, and you can care for each one of them. They're so developed you almost want to root for the bad guy.\\n\\n\nEnjoyment (9/10) I spent a week watching this show to prepare for the second season. After finishing, I was impatient waiting for season 2. This show was well worth the time put in, and will absolutely have a lasting effect on your view of how a shounen should be.\\n\\n\nOverall: (9/10) Magi is a show that should be watched, for it offers a well developed plot that's backed by great sound, art, and characters. For those into shounen, this'll  be a guaranteed favorite. For those wanting to get into the genre, it's a good starting point. And for those opposed of the genre, you're missing out.",

            "content": "So, you believe in magic? Whether that answer is a yes or no, Magi sets itself as an unique series of a classical adventure for anime fans. It's a wonderful experience and there are many ways in which Magi portrays its adventures with its cast of characters. Now, get ready because Magi might just be something to refresh your weekend with its old school themes and premise.\r\nMagi (also known as Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic as its full title) is a manga written by Shinobu Ohtaka. The series takes place in an universe that has has desert artwork scattered all around. As such, its themerelates to the classical One Thousand and One Nights and its collections. It feels like a classic honestly with its settings and atmosphere. From the beginning, we quickly meet all three of the main protagonists in the series. It doesn't take long for the action and drama to pick up its pace as in the first few episodes already explores some of the cruelty (such as slavery), the dungeons, and monstrosity that exists in the Magi universe. \\n\\n\r\nThe series is packed with both a lighthearted and action style mood as the episodes progresses. One of the things that we see is the interesting and bro-like relationship between the two main characters \u2013 Aladdin and Alibaba. Although not related, they have a close bond and a brotherly relationship in which the two often looks out after one another. The two travels together in their quests and adventures  . It's a fantasy adventure that gives off that old school like feeling as they explore the world of Magi.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough not one-hundred percent compatible, the duo has similar personalities. Both Aladdin and Alibaba shares a personality of wanting to explore the world as well as having an initiative to help others in need. They put others above themselves and always constantly looks after each others' well being. The relationship between the two is very fun to watch given their lighthearted interactions and how they conquer obstacles along the way. Additionally, the duo are very loyal and seeks ways to form bonds with others whether through words or their actions. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, this doesn't always last.\\n\\n\r\nFor some reason, the series breaks off its trials for a bit later on. The two goes off of their directions and seemingly begins their own tales. From there on, the duo seems to become independent of their own journeys as they explore their own worlds. It seems to be more character focused rather than a story by this point and things start to slow down. Additionally, what continues on seems to have little influence on the duo's journey and adventures. That and the fact in which their adventures gets off its tracks with no intertwined effect on one another seems to make a few frown on some die hard fans' faces.\\n\\n\r\nLuckily, there's still another character that brings on entertainment to Magi. Her name is Morgania and she's one tough girl with an even tougher childhood.\\n\\n\r\nJoining the duo later on, Morgania (Mor) is a young 14 years old girl who always had a tough childhood. Forced into slavery and with little freedom, we see her struggles in the world of Magi. Prior to her liberation, her personality exists opposite of the dynamic duo that we are already familiar with. Her cold personality reflects on the cruelty of what she already been through. It makes us feel sorry for her as a child and how she came to be. Yet, later on, we do see more of her caring side. In fact, Morgania even begins risking her own life to protect others in need and putting herself above others. It's proven that Morgania has forged a strong friendship with Alibaba and Aladdin and they are possibly the most important people in her life.\\n\\n\r\nOther characters in the series also has a way of setting themselves from the others. Most of their names (including the main protagonists) are based off One Thousand and One Nights along with some of its settings and themes. There are the many tribes with their leaders and prominent members such as Sinbad and Judal. They play their roles and given their status and power are considered respected as well as feared throughout the Magi world.\\n\\n\r\nThe magic part of the series also takes in every episode of course. The magic theme of the series involves the power of the djinns that comes along from the users' metal vessels. Other terms related to magic include rukh, magoi, dungeon capturer, and magi itself. It's hard to say that these themes all tie together well by they do go hand in hand. In fact, most of Magi has a desert like setting unlike our modern civilization with fancy cars, technology, and architecture. As a matter of fact, it's portrayed in that fantasy like setting with its old school like backgrounds.\\n\\n\r\nAs magi is considered the title, it is also considered a respectful term known by its name. We clearly know and see that Aladdin is a magi with his powers of being able to summon Ugo, a blue muscular like familiar that fights on his behalf. Yet at the same time, it seems that Aladdin also lacks the precise knowledge of how to perfect his skills especially later on against an antagonist. It is by this time we know that there is so much mystery that meets the eye of being what a magi is all about. Yet, with the help of his dear friends, Aladdin may unlock those mysteries.\\n\\n\r\nThe series' action is portrayed as being part of the shounen style. It involves the characters powering up, making speeches in the middle of fights, and trying to show off what they can do. To be honest, it is quite generic and some of the same cliched action scenes are forced in many ways. For example, the battle between Aladdin and another fellow magi later on starts one-sided. Yet later on, it turns around the tide and has our main protagonist Aladdin do \u201cwhat is right and stop him\u201d. The action also seems to be forced as well such as the powering up and dynamic entrances from some of the characters. Whether entering in or exiting out, it seems to be forced and lacks true action.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork design of the series is natural and sophisticated. Because it is based off One Thousand and One Nights and some of its themes, we can expect the desert like settings and their sequences employed further with the usage of magic. Most if not all of the characters are dressed in ways that are old fashioned and suited to the Sahara like backgrounds. The forest, desert, and architecture adapts an old school style that is natural and straight to the point. It doesn't try to stand out above the others in the artwork development. In fact, its visuals are focused and fluid that fits with each other.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of soundtrack, Hiromi Kikuta (Black Rock Shooter, Scrapped Princess) employs his skills in orchestrating the OST. Some of the soundtracks has that classic Arabian rhythms while other times pulls its course together with its full throttle pacing. This is especially true during scenes involving based chased at night time or when there are crucial moments of conflict. Shiro Sagisu does a similar job with his music as well with its appealing scores. The opening song, \u201cV.I.P\u201d by SID catches the viewers' attention with the way it is orchestrated by presenting the montage of its characters as well as some of the action going on. Oh and let's not forget about the all-star cast coming together. Although generic, it is appealing and classic.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Magi is a classic. It is a fantasy adventure that brings back the old school feeling with its cast of characters, its themes, style, story telling, and visual artworks. The division of the duo in later episodes may catch viewers off balance but it can still be appealing when we see more of the character backgrounds of our heroes. The trio in fact becomes a pivotal point in the series as they explore the world they never thought would come across. With magic, they can do almost anything but with friends and what they believe in, they become the next big thing. Whether Magi is the next big thing is hard to say but the adventure of Alibaba, Aladdin, and Morgania has come a long way.",

Magi is similar to Mirai Nikki in the way that they both havebatsh*t crazy mofos in it. \\n\\n\r\nnow to the review part.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\r\nawesome story. i love the arabian knights concept and the who concept of clearing dungeons and magic ect.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:10\\n\r\nAli Baba is awesome, i like his design and hes not useless compared to Aladdin. in many animes there will be an overpowered character followed by a useless \"sakura haruno\" type but this is not the case.\\n\r\nAladdin always cracks me up when he mentions boobs.\\n\r\nSharif is also one of my favorite characters so far because hes just straight up insane.\\n\\n\r\nSound/Art: 10\\n\r\nlove the opening and artwork looks amazing\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nif i could give it more than a 10/10 i would\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nagain,  if i could give it more than a 10/10, i would be much obliged. \\n\\n\r\nhope this helped persuade you to watch this AMAZING ANIME!!!!\\n\\n",

            "content": "I\u00b4ll start this review by saying that i haven\u00b4t read the manga yet, im saying this because many people say that the anime isn\u00b4t on the same level of the manga and that it is a bad adaptation missing out chapters and giving bad explanations about how things work. So keep in mind that i\u00b4m doing this review having only the knowledge given by the anime.\r\nStory/Setting/Combat depth - Ok, so i\u00b4m not only reviewing the story and world here but the combat depth too, because i think that it\u00b4s an important part on any battle anime.\r\nSETTING\r\nThe story is set in an alternate recreation of theancient Old World with several regions and nations having some resemblances with real-life counterparts from that time. In this world, all living beings possess an essence known as Rukh  and when they die, this essence returns to the huge flow (also known as \"guidance\") of Rukh that gives life to all subsequent beings in an eternal cycle of rebirth called \"Fate\". Once a person is overcome with sadness, anger and hopelessness, their Rukh turns into a corrupted, unstable, black-colored Rukh that deviates from the main guidance in a process known as \"Fall into Depravity\".\\n\\n\r\nThere are also several magic castles full of treasures and traps known as \"Dungeons\" and each of them is the lair of a powerful magic being, a Djinn. Individuals that manage to overcome the trials of a Dungeon and earn the allegiance of its Djinn are known as Dungeon Capturers, gaining the ability to use its powers infused in a personal item of them known as \"Metal Vessel\" and create less potent \"Household Vessels\" for their companions as well.\\n\\n\r\nPeople can use the Rukh in their bodies to create an energy known as Magoi ( kinda like chakra in naruto ) to power their magical weapons and abilities. This energy must be used with care, as despite the fact that an individual's magoi can be restored with feeding and rest, once fully exhausted it provokes their death. Among those that can perform magic with their own Magoi there is a rare class of magicians known as Magi, that can also use Magoi from the Rukh around them, greatly increasing their capabilities. A Magi usually chooses Dungeon Capturers to offer guidance and protection making of them their King Vessels. There are several nations in history that were founded or improved by the rule of such individuals.\\n\\n\r\nPLOT\\n\\n\r\nSo the story of magi starts out really simple but as the anime progresses it keeps evolving and adding important and nice stuff. This is the story about a young boy by the name of Aladdin and his adventures around the world of magi. Like many other series he becomes friends with many people, 2 of them are Alibaba and Morgiana, and so the 3 of them become the main characters.\\n\\n\r\n The story is mostly about war between empires/countries. Where Aladdin enters in all this is that he is a magi, a beeing that acording to legends chooses his king to control the world. Throughout the story we learn that there is more than 1 magi and that they are not on the same side so that only means 1 thing, war. There is a dark organization too called the Al Thamen that are trying to screw up the world and that side up with the empire aladdin and his friends are fighting. \\n\\n\r\nCOMBAT DEPTH\\n\\n\r\nEasily the thing i like the most about magi, there is enough depth here to the point you have to google some definitions.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the fodders use normal weapons without any special abilities, but the main weapon of all people here is Magoi, it works out like chakra from naruto, each person has their own reserve and only magi can use the magoi from the rukh around them.\\n\\n\r\nThere is the dungeon capturers too, people that successfully pass a dungeon can keep in their control the djinn of that dungeon. The djinn enters into a metal and the capturer can use that djinn\u00b4s power. For example, if a djinn\u00b4s ability is fire, that person can attack with fire. But that\u00b4s not only it, thats the basic. As time passes and you became better with your metal vessal you can use an ability called Djinn Equip, by using that your metal vessal turns into the djinn\u00b4s weapon and your ability ( fire in this case ) becomes even better. Djinn equip has diferent levels, at first you can only use the djinn\u00b4s weapon but later on you can even cover your whole body with armours and stuff. You can only maintain this ability as long as your magoi reserves let you. Oh and one more thing, if the Djinn capturer is a magi he can summon the djinn in battle ( this is exclusive of magis ).\\n\\n\r\nHousehold Vessels are objects (weapons, jewelry, accessories, etc) that hold importance to the Household Members of a Dungeon Capturer. Like for example, if my djinn type is fire my household member will have an ability connected with fire. ( Household vessels are not as strong as the djinn equip ( exclusive to dungeon capturers)).\\n\\n\r\nThere is magicians too that can manipulate their rukh and create a type of magic ( healing, heat, water, gravity etc ), with that they can create many abilities.\\n\\n\r\nIm only 25 episodes in ( 1st season ) and there is a ton of combat depth, im sure there is many many more things :)\\n\\n\r\nART\\n\\n\r\nVery colourful, there isn\u00b4t much to be said here.\\n\r\nGo to youtube and see for yourself.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nNot good enough to deserve a better score, like always the japanese voices are great but there is a lack of better osts.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nAladdin - Like i said above, a young magi boy that is traveling the world and making many friends ( sorta like luffy ) he is your typical shounen protagonist which in my opinion is a bit to mainstream but whatever.\\n\\n\r\nAlibaba - Aladdin\u00b4s friend and main character, he is a really great character and his personality develops really well and you learn about his backstory.\\n\\n\r\nMorgiana - Aladdin\u00b4s friend and main character, she, like alibaba in terms of personality develops a lot too. She belongs to a tribe called Fanalis, Fanalis are a really strong type of tribe with power that can crush rocks.\\n\\n\r\nAll the other characters are really good in design but as not very much developed ( maybe because its only 25 episodes, i dont know ).\\n\\n\r\nI can\u00b4t really say much more without spoiling it, it\u00b4s better if you watch.",

            "content": "Shows like Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic really catch me off guard. It's so rare nowadays to see a battle shonen that delivers a feeling of exploration without getting too caught up in itself. Is it perfect? Of course not, but if there's one thing it gets right is its sense of adventure. \r\nMagi takes place in a vast fantasy world with a ton of tie-ins to 1001 Arabian Nights. The setting is huge, spanning across many diverse countries, which presents an enthrallingly enormous scope. Aladdin is a young boy who some call a Magi, and the story follows his journey for self-discovery alongside hisfriends Alibaba Saluja and Morgiana of the Fanalis, who each have responsibilities and dark pasts of their own. Dungeons have been rising around the world, and the conquerors of said dungeons gain the power of a Djinn, which is basically an elemental genie. They are risen by those called Magi, who are said to be the ones to shape the world. Only three are supposed to be around in one era, but Aladdin, for some reason or another, is seen as the fourth. Along their journey, they encounter people of many kinds, ranging from the Kou dynasty which is essentially Magi's take on China, to even such figures like Sinbad of the Seven Seas. Yes, the allusions to that old desert fairy tale book, no, not the bible, are many, but seeing such a setting in an anime is extremely refreshing and gives way for some awesome locales and set pieces. \\n\\n\r\nThe art, albeit mildly inconsistent, if nicely detailed, and the character designs are fitting, memorable, colourful and just generally well crafted. The palette really captures the scorching desert heat as well as the cool city nights, making for a very immersive experience. Sadly, the same cannot be said about the fight choreography. There's a very clunky feeling to a lot of the battles due to awkward shot composition and somewhat lazy animation. The only times the fights actually impress me are when Morgiana gets involved, which may be because the animators are forced to work with punches and kicks rather than actual weapons. A1 Pictures has a bad habit of using cuts to avoid animating motion, which can get quite jarring when used frequently. If you're looking for a big budget action show, then Magi may not be for you, although the aesthetics do a fantastic job of sucking you into the world. \\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, many fights become very anticlimactic thanks to the overly fast pacing. Many of the villains get demolished only minutes after making their debut. This lack of tension becomes especially apparent during the final battle. Some are just downright silly, with the villains getting as laughable as an old man on a floating wheelchair, and some very out of place fanservice. There are a lot of cliches to be found in general. \\n\\n\r\nDespite this however, the show isn't completely generic, and this is mainly true in the surprisingly well founded cast. On the surface, Aladdin is your typical na\u00efve shota, but he has an exceptionally mature mentality in regards to society, and knows when to let others act rather than himself, showing a lot of wisdom. There's a lot of strong personalities in Magi, the highlights being the charismatic Sinbad, and the feeble yet lovable Hakuryuu. Judal is just the right level of crazy, and is a good contrast to Aladdin's light-hearted nature. Most of the humour will be hit or miss, relying on a lot of boob jokes, but there's a lot of heart to be found. \\n\\n\r\nA big theme of Magi is fate, and what it means to accept one's destiny. While there could've been a lot more done with it, the show does a very good job of showing how one's destiny can doom them into despair, or as the show calls it, depravity. Alibaba's relationship with Cassim is not only engaging to watch, but both grow a lot over the course of the show, as does Morgiana as she works through her past as a slave. \\n\\n\r\nFor a shonen, Magi delves into a lot of dark themes, but they're handled in a very black and white way, making it difficult to really take something away from them. Every villain bar one is just evil for the sake of being evil, and it's hard to get behind some of the messages when they could only help out in a fairy tale. I wish that more effort was put into making things seem more realistic, but in a way, that's a part of Magi's charm. It's not trying to be a social commentary, but rather a fun adventure, with some darker overtones to appeal to an older audience. \\n\\n\r\nThe second opening really makes this apparent with it's sense of wonder. Overall, the soundtrack is quite good, and it brings forth a distinctive Arabic flare while utilizing a lot of modern instruments, the electric guitar in particular. A lot of battle tracks are quite memorable as well, my favourites being Valse Hot and Enfin Apparu. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Magi season one is a solid watch if you're a fan of a massive setting and well founded characters, as long as you're not looking for the most mature story ever told. There are a few plotholes here and there, but compared to others in its genre, it holds up substantially well. I give Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic, a 7/10.",

The world building is nice and breathing compared to many series that make lack-luster attempts these days, and I could even go as far to compare it to the Full metal Alchemist series for a general feeling towards character development and story. Unfortunately, the series turns to absolute rubbish at episode 16 where the whole politically focused plot turns out to just be a really cliche story about \"muh darkness\", as mysterious masked men try stop them for the sakeof being evil. Everything after episode 16 feels really cliche and shallow in comparison, characters randomly acting like slice-of-life characters from generic high school anime #9840 complete with over the top emoji tier expressions that I so deeply fucking despise in Anime.  I tried to continue the series, hoping maybe the writer was just having a bad rut, but it didn't really improve. Dropped at episode 21 and didn't look back.",

            "content": "Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic is a tale of friendship triumphing over all odds. Perhaps you have heard this kind of story told elsewhere. If so, you've probably heard it told better, too. Magi is all over the place in terms of pacing and tone. Even the morals of the story seem quite in conflict with the methods used to tell it. Above all, it's just dumb and boring, which are two death sentences for an anime from this viewer's perspective.\r\nMagi is about two boys. Aladdin is an impressionable, airheaded young Magi, or wandering mage. He comes across a golden-haired and golden-hearted street urchin namedAlibaba, and they go on an adventure through a massive labyrinth called a \"dungeon\", becoming fast friends. Along the way, they encounter a mysterious and strong-legged slave girl named Morgiana, which completes their trio as they endeavor to right the world's wrongs with the phat lewts they obtained by raiding and \"capturing\" the dungeon.\\n\\n\r\nIt's right here that I should make it clear that Alibaba is perhaps the worst shounen hero I've ever seen. His character shifts between whining interminably about the state of the world, declaring it impossible to change, and attempting to change the world through perhaps the most idiotic and sure-fail ways he could come up with. He is perpetually gullible, all-too-willing to put his trust in other people with blatantly obvious \"hidden\" agendas. Say what you will about how stupid Naruto is, at least he didn't turn a blind eye to Sasuke's gradual descent into darkness. In contrast, Alibaba's childhood friend from the first arc might as well hold a giant flashing neon sign over his head that says \"I will die and/or turn evil\" for how unsubtly the series depicts him, but Alibaba never once takes the hint.\\n\\n\r\nIn this first arc, we are also introduced to Sinbad, a character that has already become a legendary king and dungeon-capturer by his own hand. He pledges his aid to helping Alibaba liberate Balbadd from the clutches of its fat, stupid king. It is at this point that the series starts undermining its own tension, because Sinbad is ludicrously overpowered compared to literally everyone else, and has eight underlings of various shapes and sizes that are also exponentially stronger than our main characters. There is no quicker way to undermine a character's personal arc than by introducing another character who could snap his fingers and solve everything for them.\\n\\n\r\nThe second arc takes place in Sinbad's kingdom of Sindria, where our trio have decided to take the demigod-level king up on an offer to train and hone their abilities. Never mind that Alibaba's country was teetering on the brink of collapse when they finished the first arc! That's not important now! There's adventure afoot! \\n\\n\r\nThis series undermines itself so often that at this point I stopped caring and just kinda tuned out any of the dialogue. I became totally disengaged from the subject matter, and was just resigned to seeing this to its conclusion. I didn't miss much. Sinbad continued to faff about and allow the villains in the series to openly taunt him to his face, kill hundreds of innocents, and splash him with some kind of curse mark that turned half his face black, only for him to reverse the curse instantly in the season climax. \\n\\n\r\nSo why did he let himself get cursed? As he put it, \"to make Alibaba more motivated to clear the next dungeon\". Never mind that Alibaba himself has been afflicted by this same curse, which is actually a very real threat to his life or at least his sanity. Sinbad decides to fake sick so he can do nothing and shift the onus of \"saving him\" onto a blonde idiot, a blue-haired idiot, a traumatized former slave who does all the figurative and literal \"heavy lifting\" of the group, and a cowardly prince whose only real use is as a literal meat-shield.\\n\\n\r\nSo if the characters and story are disappointing every time you turn around, is the action any good? Well, there are quite a lot of fight scenes in Magi, and they're universally bland shounen-style nonsense, where whoever has the most plot-induced immortality will win. A lot of time is spent developing this complex and verbally dense system of magic, but it all boils down to brightly colored energy blasts and sword swings crashing into each other, with the good guys winning through the power of friendship (read: powers pulled straight out of their asses at the last possible second). What makes this more insulting is toward the end when abilities are plagiarized wholesale from Naruto and Fate Stay/Night.\\n\\n\r\nAnd thus we get to my next big issue with this series: the word \"subtlety\" is completely lost on the writers and animators. You can easily tell by a character's dress and method of speech whether they are good or evil. (Protip: good characters are attractive and smile a lot!) I couldn't tell if this series was aimed at children or adults. It pairs simplistic, heavy-handed morals that would fit on a poster in a kindergarten classroom with buckets of gore, complicated palace intrigue, and ecchi fanservice obviously intended for a more mature audience. In trying to appeal to both kids and adults, it makes itself inappropriate for the former and insults the intelligence of the latter. This is not how you do this.\\n\\n\r\nI had the misfortune of watching this dubbed, in which I got to hear a lot of high-profile English voice actors I had a lot of respect for embarrass themselves. The only bright spot in this is Cristina Vee as Morgiana, which also matches the fact that she's the only character I found myself able to care about. The sound design is perfunctory. There's nothing special in the sound effects or music to get you interested in what's going on, and the OPs and EDs are such forgettable tripe that I skipped them routinely.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some bright spots. Visually, the show is very bright and colorful, further selling me on the idea that this is trying to ingratiate itself to a wide audience. The character designs are unique and definitely inspired by Arabian folklore, which is definitely special as far as anime goes. The cityscapes are largely gorgeous when shown in wide-panning shots, although everything looks remarkably samey when the characters are wandering the streets.\\n\\n\r\nBut the greatest sin that Magi commits, more than anything that I've listed above, is just that it's a big long snore. There's no weight to the fighting scenes, and no real reason to care about the political stuff going on in the shadows. It is trite and unoriginal in every way except the setting. You can predict the events of every episode almost down to exact detail five minutes in. Please avoid this series if you value your time.\\n\\n\r\nUntil next time, Ko Empire bills are not accepted at this establishment.",

            "content": "So after much hype from compatriots of mine I finally decided to watch \"Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic\". My friends who have watched it previously loved it. Praised it even. It quickly become one of their favorite shows, and told me it was fantastic. So did their hype build this show up too high? or Did it achieve what I was told? Well a little of both.\r\nStory: 6\r\nA shounen if I've ever seen one. The story is the usually, a run of the mill group of hero's trying to overcome adversity, and fight against the big bad. It's a formula that most Anime under thisgenre follow, and that isn't really a bad thing. It's fun, and entertaining. It also has some much needed flare from the addition of using characters from the Arabian Night stories. Sadly being fun doesn't really make it fantastic. Yes I enjoyed my time in this world and enjoyed the adventure, but it just didn't do anything beyond the template. This isn't the worst shounen I've ever seen (I'm looking at you Naruto), but it certainly isn't the best. Besides being generic, it also was plagued with some pacing problems. Some of the arc's lasted way to long. I should also note the thick level of cheese in some of the more \"emotional\" scenes. The sound designer blared away a lot of the tragedy or serious nature of these scenes with some overbearing music (more on that later). \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\\n\r\nIt isn't gonna win any awards for it's art assets, but they were good for what it was. The show was filled with bright vibrant environments, and wonderfully designed characters. Some of the CG here and there was shotty, but besides that nothing to really complain about. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\\n\r\nUsually the OST to shows don't bug me. I either love them or just shrug, but this was pretty bad. Sometimes less is more, and I don't think the director understood that. When something serious or tragic is happening I want to be able to be taken by the moment. Usually music in any medium adds to the characters and the situation, but not here. For instance in one scene their was something that was meant to be really heartwarming and serious, but this freaking \"heroic\" trumpet comes in and smashed the scene all together. It was just over bearing, and made something sad into a cheese fest. The only reason that this score isn't much lower is because some tunes were alright, and the voice acting was fair. But my god I hate it when something takes me out of a story like that. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7\\n\\n\r\nQuite the lovely ensemble of heroes. Now I assume as the story continues this score will go up. Since this isn't the complete tale there are obviously some characters that aren't fully developed or realized. The ones that we currently have are all fairly enjoyable. Alibaba and Aladdin are fantastic. Oh and Sinbad is fabulous, and a God among men. I could use a little more from Morgiana, but she was still alright. Now for the main problem I had with the characters. The villains were so meh, besides the wonderful midriff Magi known as Judal they just didn't do much. I know they will probably go into more detail about them as the story moves forward, but as of right now the whole \"evil organization\" thing is pretty lame.     \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8 \\n\\n\r\nThe more I think about it the more I actually liked the show. Even tho some parts made me question \"why this arc was lasting 7 episodes?\" or turning to my brother and saying \"Yo look at that ass pull\" I still had a ton of fun. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6.6\\n\\n\r\nThough it wasn't as good as my friends made it out to be \"Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic\" was still a fun ride. If you like shounens then I suggest giving this one a shot. If they aren't really your thing, but are just looking for some fun in the Arabian sun then I would also say go for it. Although it had some short comings and pretty horrid sound track, Magi's loveable cast of characters and entertaining world help make this adventure one worth going on.",

            "content": "Magi is an anime that you've most likely seen before a million times unless you haven't seen anything in the medium. We have the family of tropes here! Everything from characters taking five minutes preparing a single punch only at the end to scream a ludicrous nickname such as \"Rebel Power Punch\" while the opponent stands still blinking at him to the power of friendship making everything better because friendship powers. \r\nMagi does all of these overused tropes quite well. For a fan of action centered anime, it is a fun watch. But there're two major things that bothered me. The obvious one is thediscrepancy between the tones the story goes through. At one moment, you'll see people cracking dumb jokes with cute imagery, but then two seconds later someone gets slashed in half. It's honestly quite jarring. \\n\\n\r\nEven though the show is rather short, it still feels that it went longer than it should've. I'll keep it at that to respect the spoiler policy. But regardless of those two things the show is an enjoyable watch, so if you like the usual magic, punching, friendship anime where friendship transforms you into mecha version of He-man then yeah go watch it.",

            "content": "I heard of this anime plenty of times, but never gave a bother to try it just by looking at the title picture, shame on me.\r\nFor Magi's genre (adventure/fantasy) I think it successfully filled those roles.\r\nStory 9/10:\r\nThe anime's about a boy named Aladdin who is joined by his friends Morgiana and Alibaba. The anime contains magical powers but is not centered only around magic. There is also sword fighters, along with fist fighters etc. I won't mention the \"plot\" because that's a spoiler, but the anime is sort of adventurous and in the settings of empires/conquerors. \r\n I very much enjoy settings where empires, kings,queens, princes and princesses exist. Not for the monarchy though, moreover, for the ability to conquer lands and the idea of warfare. The entire setting of the story, with modern day morals and an outdated century makes the story great. The idea of self government, world government, and dictatorships are portrayed very nicely. Although some people were expecting a story more similar to Aladdin's lamp, they were probably disappointed, but just because the anime doesn't relate to that story doesn't mean it's bad. It's an entire different series of its own so it should not be compared.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10: Art is pretty good, the quality is certainly better than some other anime. The colors show out the most, the character art is not bad, the magic is well done.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10: Average sound, sound effects are good, op/ed are also good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10: The characters are likable, there's many different types of characters which would appeal to viewers. Typical protagonist hero, but not as stereotypical as one would believe. Aladdin's sort of a clueless child, but not stupid which makes him likable. Personally, I really enjoy the presence of his friends Alibaba and Morgiana. Thankfully none of the characters hold in \"secrets\" like obvious secrets where the need to tell someone or bad things will happen. That annoys me greatly, when characters know they should obviously get help, but act as if by trying to treat themselves alone they won't hurt anyone.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10: The anime gets better as it progresses, I find the battle scenes very enjoyable. Keeps me on my toes wondering what'll happen. It's pretty flashy fight scenes to, sorta cool :).\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10:. I found it worthwhile to watch and entertaining. It may not be the best anime, yet it's certainly no where near the worst, and it is enjoyable as any other anime I'd recommend. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime fell off from the manga towards the end, I think it's fine to drift away from the manga, as long as the anime itself is good. Although the ending may have been disappointing to some, I'm curious to see what it'll bring in the second season. If the anime simply ended as it did, without a second season then perhaps my rating would change, but it did not. I do wish the story stayed with the manga, but hey things change and I'm not going to automatically assume \"wow anime destroyed good job\" without even giving it a shot. That's just ignorant. Keep in mind if the author of the manga finds it acceptable to deviate away from the manga in some episodes, then no one should be saying \"they screwed it all up\" since it didn't follow an exact plot line they desired to occur.",

In Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic, the show would have you believe that while \"destiny\" may guide your path, you alone have the ability to change its course.\r\nSTORY\r\nM:L (what I'll be calling it from now on), begins with our star Alibaba having a chance encounter with Aladdin. Both boysdecide to work together in order to fulfill the dreams and goals that they each have.\\n\\n\r\nSomething that sets M:L apart from other shows is in its world building. Immediately, it enthralls you in this world that deals with magic, dungeons, and class systems. The setting is both fantastical and realistic. The former with its ideas about \"Rukh\" and Djinn, while the latter in its environments, people, and locations. This was something I really enjoyed, because not a lot of shows take place in such a strange time-period. It gave off an Egyptian vibe that worked quite well with the magical nature of the show.\\n\\n\r\nM:L is essentially split up into four arcs: character introduction arc, Aladdin's and Morgiana's arc, Cassim arc, and Sindria arc. Within each one, the show strikes a really nice balance between comedy and action. I often found myself laughing at Morg's rare cuteness and Aladdin's affinity for breasts. The action, likewise, was always pleasing to see. Watching two Metal Vessel users duke it out always provided for crazy acrobatics and smart strategy.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the show falters when it comes to the drama it instills. The majority of the time, the drama either lasts too long or is not properly executed in relation to the rest of the show. This becomes extremely noticeable during the Cassim arc. Personally, I found this portion of the show to be the weakest. It felt three or four episodes too long and detracted away from what the show does so well, namely the world building and action sequences. I wouldn't say it was melodramatic, because it does relate to what occurs later on and is important for certain characters growth-wise, but part of me feels that the drama itself was stretched out a bit too much.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nTaking place mostly across desert regions, you would think that M:L wouldn't have much leeway in terms of its visuals. Thankfully, this wasn't the case.\\n\\n\r\nThe show uses a pretty expansive color palate, not only with the characters' hair but also with their designs and the actual environments. The show mostly takes place within city-states in Egyptian landscapes, so it mostly sticks to beige, brown, and clay-red for its buildings and roads. At the same time though, the show looks to always inject color in all the right places.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to actual animation, I found it to be above average. While the show does incur quite a bit of dialogue, when it comes to the action pieces, it really doesn't hold back. From Alibaba's self-engulfing flames to Morg's crazy parkour fighting style, there is always something moving about on-screen.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are also pretty unique. There are a lot of minor characters, but even they look vastly different when compared to one another. With such a large cast, it can be difficult sometimes to remember every single name, so their appearances matter greatly. In this case, M:L does a fantastic job in making every single one, from the good guys to the bad guys, look and feel different.\\n\\n\r\nOne final note is the way in which some of the characters smile. The animators chose to draw some characters' upper teeth when they smile. I actually liked this little addition because it seemed more natural for a wide-grin. Nothing amazing, but a nice little touch!\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nArguably M:L's weakest part is its characters.\\n\\n\r\nLet's start off with the bad. Surprisingly, my least favorite character in the show is Alibaba. What's interesting is that the show takes considerable time in developing his background and who he actually is as a person. But the trouble comes in what they actually do with it. Many of the issues that the characters' face during their journey are a result of Alibaba's decision making. My issue is that, despite the things he's heard and learned alongside Aladdin and the others, he constantly is making poor choices. Meaning, he never truly grows as a character and instead regresses before he can progress. It gets rather annoying to see this, and as such, I found his character to be rather unlikable.\\n\\n\r\nSinbad is another character I actually didn't like, or perhaps it's better to say that the show prevented me from liking or even disliking him. It's clear when we first see him that he is quite the strong and persuasive person. But that's it. While he sticks around for the entire second half of the season, we never really learn anything about him. Sure, they show off some of his skills, but we don't know what his goals are, who he is deep down, and why we should care for him at all. I felt that M:L dropped the ball when it came to his character because he was constantly put on such a high pedestal.\\n\\n\r\nSwitching gears, one of my favorite characters in the show is easily Aladdin. Bright, optimistic, and full of life, he is always looking out for and cheering on others, especially Alibaba. His origin still remains a mystery, but the show gives us nice insight as to who Aladdin really is and the purpose he serves in the overall narrative. He's a fun character not only to watch and listen to, but also to learn from, because the viewer is always learning right along with him.\\n\\n\r\nMy favorite character from the show is hands-down Morgiana. Loyal, loving, and wicked-strong, she is one of the most interesting simply due to her original predicament. While she adores working together with Alibaba and Aladdin, her personal struggles are her true defining features. While it takes time for her to acclimate to the differing situations that she is thrust into, you can always expect to see her making you smile, saving her friends, and otherwise presenting you with a really good time.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe first OP for M:L is pretty darn good. The tempo and especially the singer create a nice mix of \"sweeping\" sounds that fits the tone of the show perfectly. The second OP doesn't come close to how good the first is. It tries to be more grand in both the singing and instruments, but it just doesn't fit well with the way in which the show presents itself.\\n\\n\r\nThe first ED is actually interesting. As a standalone song it is pretty good, but honestly speaking, it doesn't really have a place in the show. It's almost too upbeat in relation to the show. M:L is definitely happy and carefree during certain segments, but never on this level. The second ED suffers the same fate as the second OP, in that it is just not good. It's too generic and guitar-filled and doesn't mesh well with the rest of the show.\\n\\n\r\nAt this point, I just want to point out that the first OP's and first ED's visuals are the most misleading visuals for an opening and ending song that I have ever seen. I don't know if the studio should be commended or not for this, but it is kind of strange how irrelevant a lot of what they show in both of them really are.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the soundtrack is pretty darn good as well. Sticking with the Egyptian vibe, the show sticks heavily to that type of music, with flutes and drums galore.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of voice acting, the show does an average job in this regard. No character's were extremely standout, but there were no issues in each of their respective roles.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nAnime gives us the opportunity to see things that we normally can't. This is especially true when it comes to the worlds that they present. In this case, M:L did a wonderful job in making me not only aware of the world but also really care for it. Its unique setting (relative to anime) makes it very fun to watch because nothing else is really like it.\\n\\n\r\nThe show's comedy mostly sticks to the way in which characters act in a certain situation, and for the most part, I always found these bits pretty funny. The hints of romance were also duly noted and appreciated. And as far as the fights go, I actually quite liked them. Some were large in scale, some were one on one, but they all had nice detail and varied move-sets that made each one a pleasure to watch.\\n\\n\r\nI found myself really wanting to see what was going to happen next. But if there is one gripe that I had, it was the overuse of \"convenient\" plot points. Not wanting to spoil anything, I will say at the minimum that certain things happen rather conveniently during the story's progression. So many times, in fact, that you start to anticipate the next time it is going to happen.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic is a show that does many things right with a few missteps along the way. Hopefully the second season can improve upon its weaknesses and truly stand among the best of the best.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Good, unique world, cool action, but elongated drama\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Great, nice visuals, interesting settings, and well done actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Fine, Alibaba is bad yet offset by the good that is Morgiana and Aladdin\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good, first OP and ED are leagues better than the seconds, nice soundtrack, average VAs\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good, interesting and fun with only minor issues to complain about\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 7/10",

She is hands-down the best thing in existence. \\n\r\nWhile the show is generally missing a few good female characters, Morgiana would take the place of best girl no matter how perfect the others could be! JUST LOOK AT THAT FACE!\\n\r\nIn the beginning, she follows our male protagonists only out of thankfulness for freeing her, but soon, she evolves into their friend, making these 3 characters a really good team.\\n\\n\r\nAs for other important characters, there's Sinbad, also called \"Sinworst\", which is true. \\n\r\nHe's introduced as a pretty laid-back, but powerful man, having conquered not one, but seven dungeons in his life-time. \\n\r\nHe's not having that much of a formed character during this season, but he is more important for the future of the franchise.\\n\\n\r\nSimilarily, Judar, a black-haired mage working for Kou, a big empire in the east inspired by chinese history, seems like a normal \"bad guy\", but does have some signs of there being a reason for why he is how he is.\\n\\n\r\nHakuryuu, a prince of that Kou empire, is important for the future of the series as well, but already has relevance in the second half of the first season, where he's getting a decent character, not on the level of Alibaba and Aladdin, but by far enough to impress me.\\n\\n\r\nThe secondary characters sadly go nowhere out of the ordinary, with the only ones worth mentioning for me being the grandmother of the Kouga tribe and Hakuryuu's sister, Hakuei. \\n\r\nThe first serving as a mentor for Aladdin, teaching him what life means and how you have to deal with putting your life on the line in a fight. \\n\r\nThe later mostly introducing the Kou empire and showing that it isn't full of bad people and that their goal isn't just to conquer the world, but to actually unify it and create one peaceful country. \\n\r\nThe several antagonists introduced in each arc have some reasoning behind their actions, but are generally more mid-tier, but the important ones are really not bad characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is really the thing that makes me completely disappointed of the adaptation. \\n\r\nThe quality drops so hard that the second half wasn't really enjoyable anymore, and after having read the manga, I wanted to watch the show just to see Morgiana dance. \\n\r\nYes, I am salty because it didn't look like shown in the second opening, but still, the animation has no positive points, and except for a few scenes, the first half doesn't stand out either.\\n\r\nThe actual artstyle though is kinda interesting, as the different influences are really fun to see and observe. \\n\r\nIt ranges from the already mentioned \"1001 nights\" and imperial chinese over to the mongolian plains, where the Kouga clan lives. \\n\r\nAnd Sindria is apparently based on India.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the character designs, I can just say that  -quote- \"all the characters are cute\"  -quote end-. \\n\r\nNo seriously, like the world, the characters with their different nationalities are all interesting enough to make me want to see more. \\n\r\nAnd Morgiana is cute. \\n\r\nNo objection accepted!\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack centers mostly around the thematic of  \"1001 nights\", with most songs straying a bit in different directions, which is interesting, and there are definetly a few in there I listen to outside of the show.\\n\r\nIf I had to mention my favorites, they'd be #1 - \"Enfin Apparu\", #6 - \"Faut il Saver\" and #13 - \"Valse Hot\".\\n\\n\r\nThen there's the voice acting, in which my second big problem with the show lies, even though it is heavily influenced by my knowledge of the manga. \\n\r\nIt makes perfect sense to let a woman voice the 10 year old Aladdin, but it just quickly doesn't feel right anymore, with him soon stopping to act like a kid and his appearance remaining the only childish feature he has. \\n\r\nThe other characters fit their voices pretty well, so I won't complain about any of them.\\n\\n\r\nI've been saying \"For the future\" a lot in this review, so I'll need to get this out of the way. \\n\r\nThe show is not finished, but the manga just entered its final arc not too long ago and I predict the announcement of a third season towards its final stretch. \\n\r\nThis may take a few more years, I'll just unknowingly throw \"Summer 2017\" in the room, but keep in mind, I don't know any more about this than the next person.\\n\\n\r\nNow, that's it, but is \u201eMagi: The Labyrinth of Magic\u201c worth the watch?\\n\\n\r\nThe thing is: You should give the franchise a chance!\\n\r\nIf you like manga, I'd actually prefer to recommend you  giving that one a read. \\n\r\nIf you don't want to read the manga, try watching the anime. \\n\r\nI can't say the show is good, especially because of the problems in animation, but I dare say the story and characters are on par with something like Fullmetal Alchemist, which is commonly reffered to as a masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nSo to sum it up with one simple question: \\n\r\nWould you watch Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, if the animation sucked? \\n\r\nIf your answer is yes, then go watch Magi, if the answer is no, give the manga a read! \\n\r\nIf you don't want to read the manga, definetly go for the anime, you'll just have to sit through the enjoyment-killing parts.\\n",

            "content": "I just finished this anime and I'm breathless. It is amazing. \r\nStory 9/10\r\nMagi has unique Arabian setting, with on characters from 1001 Nights. In short, it is about a young magi Aladdin and his chosen king's candidate Alibaba along with a former slave Morgiana developing their power while traveling to different places. A lot of things comes their way but they make a lot of friends and allies as well.\r\nThe concept of magic (magoi) here is interesting. It comes from the nature, and goes back to the nature when we dies. I can accept the logic. The dungeon and djinn are well thought and hadnever been brought up before in other anime, I find it makes this anime unique.\\n\\n\r\nWhile it brings typical issues like bad guys vs good guys, they address it in such a way that makes us wonder about what we think is right. People have their own goals, but the way they achieve it may be harmful to others or helpful. Magi reminds me of this. \\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\r\nRegarding Art, I'm not just talking about character design. The character designs are very colorful, stands out and memorable. The characters from Balbadd and Sindria have clothing suitable with the Arabian theme while the characters from Kou Empire have touches of oriental / East Asian feel, making it easier to recognize who is who. \\n\\n\r\nThe background and sceneries are fantastically done with eye-pleasing color palettes and amazing details, I feel is one of the best works from A-1 Pictures. The animation and visual effects is also considered fluid for that year, especially the magoi, battle scenes and facial expression.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10\\n\r\nWe will meet with names we are familiar with like Aladdin, Alibaba, Morgiana, and Sinbad. However, the characters are different from their original Arabian story. In my opinion, Magi has very well developed character. Each of them has interesting back stories (even the bad guys like Judar and Cassim) that make you understand why they do things and their reasons make you sympathize with them. In addition, the seiyuus who voice them are top notch and did great job!\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\r\nI am not really a fan of the openings and endings except The Bravery, but it is memorable. Some of the rock BGM by Shiro Sagisu did increase the tension during fights but I caught the same song being played again and again.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\r\nAlthough I have watched a lot of anime with shounen genre, I bet this is one of those I will remember. I enjoyed a lot of fun and squealed a lot too (yeap, to Aladdin's cuteness, Alibaba's resolve, Morgiana badass moments and of course Hakuryu)\\n\\n\r\nSome people who read the manga complains that it is too short, yeah although I didn't read the manga I feel the last few episodes indeed feel rushed. Aside from that, the pacing in Magi is nice, relaxing and funny, then tense and exciting during battles and wars. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I like Magi and recommend this to you who like fantasy anime with magic and battles which is not too long, while still maintaining good story and characters with depth.",

            "content": "When i think Magi, i think action and comedy perfectly blended in together into one beautifully presented adventure. Not only did magi has stunning visuals and amazing choreography in fights, but the voice acting also seemed perfect, requiring no time to \"get used to their voices\" like some dubs and subs have. Now to preface i did watch magi in sub (don't even know if there is a dub) and let me tell you i could close my eyes and fall asleep to those damn voices man. Casting was near perfect with only a few moments where i thought (his voice doesn't really fit thatcharacters look). Now if you want to know my absolute opinion feel free to check the conclusion down at the bottom.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\r\nThe story in Magi is on par with those that are claimed to be the greats. It's essentially about a kid who is called the Magi, Magi are \"Magicians that shape the world\". By using Magoi (the power created from harnessing Rukh), they are able to control these Rukhs that come naturally from the earth. Magi have the power to summon Dungeons, and to lead people in there. Magi bestow the magical items found in Dungeons to the people he leads. This essentially means that Aladdin is the center character with \"side kicks\" however don't go into this anime expecting the show to be completely centered around Aladdin with no character development for the others. All the characters in the story are fully fleshed out and are not in anyway neglected. As far as the story's fluency goes it proceeds from event to event in such a way that if feels normal, nothing feels too rushed and nothing feels like its being dragged on for way too long and each event feels like it has a purpose and develops each character thoroughly.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nWhat is there to say? The visuals are absolutely stunning, the art design was very Egyptian style. There are two predominate styles of art here in Magi, the first style is the usual art where the characters are shaped normally and everything is fabulous. Then there's the art style that's normally shown in times of comedy where all the characters bodies are 2d and have an extreme amount of emphasis on how their feeling for example if Aladdin is happy he will turn into a squishy ball as he rubs up against the boobs of a random citizen. The lighting and clarity are an amazing selling point for magi as well. Everything seems to be where it should be, flickering fire torches reflect on their clothing in real time. The background in Magi is also extensively done, there was no lack of effort when it came to putting in detail into the background. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nMy god did Shir\u014d Sagisu NAIL THE MUSIC. To give you some context Sagisu is the composer for Magi, you may know some of his work as he was the composer for most noticeably Neon Genesis Evangelion, Bleach and more recently Black Bullet. Now i will say this now if you want a soundtrack that includes music that displays the characters emotions you may not be too satisfied with this OST. This soundtrack targets the scenes and emotions of the overall context, this means no slow and sombre music unless the scene calls for it, not the character. This by no means is to hammer on Sagisu's music. He captures the feeling of battle perfect with such tracks as \"Enfin Apparu\", \"Valse hot\" and for a more situational feel of \"Notre empire\". Sagisu nails the music and i tell you right now when i was done with Magi i instantly downloaded the OST onto my computer and still listen to it this day.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\r\nAs i previously discussed in the story section all the characters in this show are fully fleshed out and on top of that no one feels like they have been ripped out of your typical shounen genre and made into a strict character archetype. Now this means that your not gonna be sitting there thinking \"This character's only purpose is so the show can have that specific archetype\" instead you'll be thinking about that characters reason for being in the show (and trust me they flesh out everyone's reasoning as to why they are in the show). Each character has their specific morals and emotions that clearly separates them from each other and also clearly shows why they act the way they do. The design of each character is perfectly don't as well as the symbolism in each character such as their hair. All in all i thoroughly enjoyed the ways the characters interacted with each other and easily got emotionally attached to each character to the point where i would be on the edge of my seat every time they were exposed to danger.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nOk so lets make this clear, if i could be bias and list things off my personal enjoyment i would give everything in this anime a 10. Unfortunately this would be a crappy review if all i said was \"THIS ANIME IS F@#KING LEGENDARY\". But when i really think about it, i can't really be specific about my personal enjoyment. Absolutely everything about this anime made me when to go on google and look at everything i could, go on youtube and listen to everything i could, talk to friends to debate about everything i could. This anime sparked so much enjoyment out of me from the perfectly crafted action scenes and the perfectly placed humor that made me thoroughly enjoy everything this anime had to offer.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9.5/10\\n\r\nOk so maybe i tend to over rate anime based on my emotions but so what! If your like me and have emotions that outweigh logic than you'll look past all the flaws of this anime and be absorbed by its brilliance. I fully recommend watching this anime as it will pull you away from all the slice of life and romance and really give you something to watch and be in awe of.",

            "content": "Magi: the labyrinth of Magic's first few episodes were pretty good; it was cute, funny, charming and awesome. Sadly, it didn't stayed like that for the whole series. For the first half of the series, 1-13 was at pretty watchable. The second half was the main weak point of the anime; all those cute and funny moments disappeared on the second half (14-25), and the ending wasn't that great. Though, it was a happy ending, but still, it was a crappy happy ending. \r\nStory? Story is pretty good, Aladdin, a Magi meets a young boy, Ali Baba an  Aladdin helps him fulfils one ofhis dreams; completing a dungeon. Then comes my favourite character in the anime, Morgiana. After completing the dungeon, she was set free from slavery with the help of Aladdin and Ali Baba. After all that dungeon-exploring in the first few episodes, Aladdin soon goes alone into different territories and the main topic of discussion was, War. War always sprouted from hatred. War is main topic of the entire series. Though, most of the excitement starts fading away when it was in the Balbadd arc; it's not bad, but it's at least, watchable. \\n\\n\r\nMain focus in the Balbadd arc was Ali Baba and his friend Kassim. Flashbacks start appearing in the series, Ali Baba's and Kassim's past begins to unravel. These flashbacks weren't too bad, I found it pretty interesting to watch. The action scenes in this arc becomes a pretty boring. Surprisingly, there was a filler episode about Sinbad and one of the Princesses of Kou somewhere later in the series; and yes, it was pretty boring, and most importantly, pointless. I think, the whole story of the anime strayed far off from the manga's point of view somewhere in episode 20, or probably even earlier than that.\\n\\n\r\nA-1 Pictures is starting to make a name for itself(or they already had) for making terrible original endings. First anime I've watched from the same studio (as far as I can remember), was Ao no Exorcist, and yes it had a lot of potential to become a great anime, though its biggest flaw is its ending.  The studio's biggest mistake has always been the same: starts off good in the first half, terrible second half, then accompanied with a terrible original anime ending. What happened to Ao no Exorcist, also happened to Magi - Labyrinth of Magic. I guess, history really does repeat itself.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters? Magi uses characters from the Arabian nights, making them look more awesome than the actual person from the stories. For example, take a look at Ali Baba in the original Ali Baba and the forty thieves tale. and try comparing it to the Ali Baba in the anime. Look how they awesome they become. My favourite character is Morgiana, a tough chick. First 20 episodes, I watched Magi because of the plot. Then after that, I felt that the plot became somewhat rushed and strayed off from the Manga. So in the later episodes, I watched Magi mainly just because of Morgiana. Also, Aladdin and Ali Baba are both likeable main characters. \\n\\n\r\nSound? The opening and Ending theme were so-so, and the voice-acting were pretty awesome. But the background music was very epic, especially during the fighting scenes. \\n\\n\r\nVisual? Though, its visuals are pretty good, but not always. The quality of visuals sometimes end up looking pretty bad, where characters faces look somewhat different. But overall visuals are decent.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion? Though, I find Magi to be very awesome in the earlier episodes but somewhat boring in the later episodes, so I find it a little difficult for who recommend it to. obviously enough, if you like prefer the shounen/action genre, Magi is definitely a good choice. Though, it's definitely not recommended for everyone.",

            "content": "Initial Review for Newcomers: Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic is loosely based on One Thousand and One Nights (more commonly known as Arabian Nights). A boy named Aladdin has been bestowed with great power and with his friends, he will help save/protect the world. Over the course of their adventure, they encounter treasures, magic, women and... social and political injustices. Over the course of this anime, dark themes of slavery, poverty, corruption and war occur. This anime expresses these themes in a similar fashion to another well known show (Yes, I'm referring to Avatar: The Last Airbender; although Avatar's dark themes are lightly touched andmore war oriented).\\n\\n\r\nDub or Sub?: Either one, though I would recommend the sub. The dub is watchable (not bad but not good either) but I didn't find Aladdin's voice to be childlike enough. Alibaba's voice sounded a bit effeminate the first time I heard it. Morgiana's voice was good. Sinbad's voice matched up pretty well. There was also one character whose voice didn't match up at all but I forgot his name. All things considered, the dub is watchable, with minor problems. The sub was superb, I found very little problems with the Japanese cast.\\n\\n\r\nStory (8/10): The story of Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic focuses on Aladdin and his friends Alibaba and Morgiana. The show starts off simple enough, Aladdin and his (future) friends go on a perilous quest to seek their fortune. Eventually, they will face dark challenges on the their journey. An interesting aspect of the story is the addition of war and politics. This becomes more apparent as the story progresses with the introduction of Sinbad, the country of Balbadd and the ongoings of the Kou Empire.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8/10): The show borrows several character elements from its source material. The three protagonists, Aladdin, Alibaba and Morgiana each retain several traits in common with their original counterparts. The same goes for other characters like Sinbad, Cassim and Scheherazade (we'll see her later in the second season).\\n\\n\r\nAladdin is an innocent child. His interactions with others shows his naivet\u00e9. His personality is wise and he always tries to find non-violent solutions problematic situations. For the most part, he tries to see the best in people and adds a lot of emotion to the story.\\n\r\nSide note: I think the creators of the show should have toned down his perverted behavior.\\n\\n\r\nAlibaba is a na\u00efve idealist.  His reasons are there but the execution of said reasons prove to be difficult (without help from others). This is very apparent when his backstory and life choices are shown in the Fog Troupe Arc.\\n\\n\r\nMorgiana is a strong, independent woman. Like Alibaba, she is portrayed as na\u00efve (primarily due to her enslavement) but she is also strong willed. Her personality develops very well throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nSupporting Characters: There is a lot of supporting characters. Each one of them have unique personalities and perspectives that really help move the story. Most of them have enough backstory/development to become a main character (FYI, they made a spin-off starring Sinbad).\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation (10/10): The art/animation is modern. The backgrounds are very detailed and colored brightly. The same goes for any battle scenes that take place; the animation is very fluid.\\n\\n\r\nSound/Music (9.5/10): The sound/music was good. The opening theme music was Middle Eastern-esque and was exciting and upbeat. The soundtrack over the adventure and battles were really enjoyable too. My only concern was the ending theme. It just doesn't seem to go with the show as an ending theme.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10): I enjoyed it. By the end of the first season, I wanted to see more.\\n\\n\r\nSummary/Overall (8/10): The story was good and exciting. The character development is excellent. The music is also very good. The amount of satisfaction after watching this is high.\\n\\n\r\nReview #11",

            "content": "Magi is certainly not the best shonen anime ever made, but it is certainly enjoyable.\r\nThe primary selling point, especially in the first half of the show, is definitely the setting and cultural aesthetic. Magi showcases lands inspired by various middle eastern and asian cultures, primarily those of historical Islam and China. The show establishes itself as separate fantasy world, so keep in mind that it is not trying to be historically accurate despite the inspiration from \"1001 Nights.\"\r\nThe animation is bright and colorful which compliments the fantastical settings, powers, and more outwardly cute art style. In addition, most of the character designs are neat andmemorable; standouts include Hakuryuu, Judal, Sinbad, and his eight generals. The only aspect about the style that was irksome was that the characters' faces tended to be homogenous, with both male and female characters based on the same model. Voice alone seems to determine gender, and hair style and eye color determine identity. Of course, these trends are nothing new in anime, but the frequency of their occurrence makes it jarring, nontheless. (Notable exceptions include Sinbad and a couple members of his posse, but that's about it).\\n\\n\r\nThe actual story was decent enough, but nothing groundbreaking. It seemed to meander, but I suppose it's composed of arcs, however small and loosely defined. Magi doesn't really pick up until the last fourth of the show, which is problematic from a plot and pacing standpoint. However, the world, powers, and characters are good enough to carry the show on its own. Even when the show attempts a large-scale plot, it is ultimately the characters that make it worth watching. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of which, Alibaba is adorable and a protagonist worth rooting for, and Aladdin's draw is how he is often wise beyond his years. However, the perverted boob jokes involving Aladdin definitely detract from the integrity of the character. Honestly, most of the chibi comic relief in Magi just seems strange and out of place. The third protagonist is Morgiana, a former slave girl and definitely the weakest of the main trio (in regard to personality and character; she is definitely physically stronger than the other two). She is just simply uninteresting. Now, the show does go to great lengths to flesh out her development, but it means nothing if the character is uninteresting to watch. Unfortunately, it just makes the development seem contrived. \\n\\n\r\nSinbad is by far the most charismatic and appealing character, and all of his generals are equally so. It's a pity that we didn't see more from them, as small bits of information about their backstories and personalities caught my attention. Sinbad definitely delivered from a character standpoint, but we didn't see enough of him fighting with his djinn equip powers, which is just odd considering that his dungeon capturing adventures and resulting numerous amount of djinn vessels are kind of his claim to fame. Also, there was a startling reveal about him in the last episode, but of course there was no time for the show to go into that. I hope that the second season explores Sinbad and his generals' developments more.\\n\\n\r\nAll of the conflicts in Magi are sorted into black and white, often literally! This is certainly the show's biggest, most glaring problem . The rukh (essentially glowing spirit butterflies) are labelled as a force of good while the reverse \"black\" rukh are only seen as evil. Which is strange, as the black rukh only make people fall into \"depravity.\" It is natural for a person to have moments of moral lapse, pining for revenge, feeling angry, greedy, etc., so it seems odd to just rule these feelings off as evil, especially to the point where feeling any of these in a small amount essentially leads to magical self destruction.\\n\\n\r\nIn summary, Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic is colorfully animated with rich and diverse settings, characters, and powers. However, don't expect anything too groundbreaking in terms of story and quell any hopes for moral ambiguity.",

Despite, its cutesie like appearance, Magi actually takes the show on a slightly darker path than expected, thus leaving the watcher surprised and wanting more. Magi follows the journey of young Aladdin, and his friends Alibaba and Morgiana, as he tries to figure out who and what he is, all the while making new friends and stumbling into magical battles. You can\u2019t helpbut fall in love with the story line and the characters (even the one on the opposing side). It\u2019s imagery, character development, and fight sequences have your jaw dropping and heart squealing in happiness as your favorite characters save the day and transform into total bad asses. Magi also has a way of forcing the viewers to fall in love with every single character and understand the meaning behind every single action, even if that action is to destroy the world and kill innocent people. The way each character\u2019s background is presented have you wishing for their redemption instead of their demise. It\u2019s one of those anime\u2019s that doesn\u2019t believe in things such as \u201cbad\u201d and \u201cgood\u201d rather it focuses on telling everyone\u2019s struggle and strife to the point where you can\u2019t help but relate to them and agree/not agree with their methods but still hope for their success. So if you\u2019re looking for something cute, dangerous, new, and exciting then Magi is definitely the anime for you\\n\\n",

            "content": "Only saw the first season of Magi, which is the labyrinth of magic. I had many thoughts while watching this.... and I wished to share them with y'all. Hopefully this will entice you to watch the show, as it had for me. I have no doubt that this will be a great watch for you if you can connect with it, and if not, then it is at least an enjoyable and solid watch. So, moving on, here are the thoughts I had while watching this show.\r\nAll throughout the show I couldn't help but feel as though they actually had a plot.... Magi, using thepower of the rukh which are the spirits of the people. When I had heard this, I couldn't but feel as though this had a meaning behind it. It had a solid explanation and one I could connect with. Usually I would like to explain how I could connect to this, but on a personal basis, and on a more subconscious basis, I cannot explain how. When you watch Magi you will know if you had connected to it or not.\\n\\n\r\nThis show also had a very adventurous spirit to it, it wasn't episodic, it followed one story one path and had that adventurous feel to it. Some things are indeed explained but can be easily overlooked when you are caught up in the joy ride of Magi. It's a solid watch for anyone who has no interest in some of the things that Magi talks about. And about that... I had connected to those beliefs on a deep level, and I would like to share this with anybody. For those who are willing to watch this, this story will be an amazement to how deeply it talks about its subject (trying to keep as little spoilers as possible). \\n\\n\r\nThe fighting had a solid feel to it, and you felt as though anybody wasn't obviously stronger than the other. To put into more precise terms, everyone has their own specialty. Of course there are those that are flat out stronger, however, it feels as though everyone has their own specialty, and no one's simply \"Weak.\" \\n\\n\r\nI would like to bring up this point, I wish to get this across. This show brings up some very deep and serious topics. You relate this show to a slice-of-life romance drama anime and it feels as though their problems are almost petty compared to those in this show. You can tell that these are things anyone could easily fall into it if given the same circumstances... When you connect with this show, you'll start to feel yourself choke up at some points (at least for me I did). You can understand their pain and reasoning and it's not very hard to interpret. Fate, destiny, to curse it and say screw it all. Magi is a show not to be simply taken lightly, it talks about many serious topics that go on a spiritual level and on a subconscious level. And even if you don't connect with this show, if you enjoy anime, you will definitely enjoy Magi.\\n\\n\r\nPS: The music choice was very bad at some points.... This was a reaccuring thought all throughout my watch with Magi and I couldn't help but say it at these last few moments. However the music alone was very nice to listen to, like the openings and endings. There were some plot holes, the character development and plot development were great, the story had an adventurous feel. The story was not jacked up as \"IM OVERPOWERED TIME TO WRECK YOU ALL!\" But it actually felt as though there was development in it. You can connect to the characters and feel their pain and understand their circumstances. This was a very enjoyable watch... I hope you all enjoy.",

            "content": "Warning: long, affectionate rant ahead about my favourite series. And when I say rant, I really mean rant.\r\nThis is the series that got me addicted to anime. Previously, my otaku friend had been persuading me to watch all the ones she liked, Bleach, Naruto, Fairy Tail and none of them really clicked for me. Within seconds of starting up Magi, however, I was absolutely in love with it.\r\nI'm someone who is a massive, uber fantasy nerd. Game of Thrones is only the beginning, I probably have 100s of fantasy books on my shelves. My favourite kind of fantasy books are the ones with masses ofwizards and epic quests and heroes and epic sword fights. That sounds pretty shallow, but it's true.\\n\r\nThere are two types of fantasy books: High fantasy and low fantasy. Low fantasy is usually the kind that links back to the modern world. The kind of fantasy where the protagonist goes to school in the day and fights monsters at night. But high fantasy is set in a world with completely different kingdoms, entire civilizations invented by the author. The kind of setting that can have one wizard destroy an entire invading army, dragons guarding piles of treasure, and brutal wars between seven different kingdoms at once.\\n\r\nMagi is a high fantasy, which is a rare trait in anime indeed. (This is basically the psychology behind why I started liking it so much relative to other anime and now I sort of realise that most likely no one cares but I'll get onto better content soon).\\n\r\nBasically this show is some epic fantasy stuff. The protagonists don't go to school, they go to war. If you even remotely like Lord of the Rings or Game of Thrones (or any other book in that genre ever), magi is the right show to watch. There are a few other high fantasy anime (berserk, claymore) but I think magi has the best setting and characters.\\n\r\n*ahem* So now onto the actual reasons it's amazing as an anime.\\n\\n\r\nTHE BATTLES.\\n\r\nUsually in an anime when the main characters are totally OP (the main Magi, Aladdin is basically God when it comes to magic), things start to get boring fight after fight. But in Magi, everyone is completely OP. They've all got such badass djinn equips and flashy abilities. What happens when one Magi, with the ability to destroy the entire world, fights another Magi, with the same potential? Massive destruction and sandstorms the size of countries, that's what. I guarantee you'll be squealing in awe when you finally see Sinbad's full djin equip XD \\n\\n\r\nTHE CHARACTERS.\\n\r\nUsually when I'm watching a show, I end up resenting one or more of the main characters. This is often something to do with shipping and my OTPs. This is not the case with Magi. There's not a single annoying character. The bad guys all have purpose and are very slick and cool (looking at you Judal). Aladdin is just a total lad, Morgiana the toughest (and cutest) girl you'll ever see, and Alibaba is the happy-go-lucky adorable little pervert you've gotta love. Magi spends a lot of time on developing its characters, but it never distracts you from the action.\\n\\n\r\nTHE WORLD.\\n\r\nWho loves grey morality? I do! And there's a lot of it in Magi. You're left not knowing who or what to support. Magnostadt vs. Leam in season 2 just gets ridiculous! The world in Magi can be a very harsh place when it wants to be - it's not just a typical bright eyed save the world shonen.\\n\\n\r\nTHE HUMOR.\\n\r\nGod, is Magi funny. I value humor very highly in my enjoyment of a series. You'll be cracking up in every spare moment. It can get more hilarious than some straight out comedies which makes watching it just that much more fun. Serious anime can be good, but comedies are great.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Magi is one hell of an adventure. It's a shonen with a bloody training arc and many of the stereotypes. But out of the 40 or so anime I've watched, it's still my favourite. I hope it goes on for a mother-load of series and becomes a massive hit.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

He is pushing the storyline in a pace, that I didn't find myself confused with the plot. From the beginning, I felt that Magi was built on a \"solid base\". Later on you get introduced, to a lot of new characters. Most of them seem a lot more interesting than Aladdin.\r\nI didn't noticed a filler episode, so you will get something new in each one. The format is based on shounen, you will get a lot of - friendship, morale, good/bad, black/white,...\r\nAlibaba envisions the shounen stereotypes and getsmost of the development. But, there is one thing I don't get. Why he must be, so whinny ? His motivational monologues and dialogues before and during battles, irritated me. \\n\\n\r\nMorgiana. An interesting character, with the right amount of development. For me, she is the core of Magi.\\n\\n\r\nAnd, there are the others. The guys&girls from Sindria and Kou Empire. They have a lot more going for them, than the main cast. At least, they have a decent amount of screen time.\\n\\n\r\nHuge plus to the art style, it captures the fighting scenes in a good amount of depth. \\n\r\nOh and the soundtracks. A masterpiece for me, I can't get enough of it.",

            "content": "Magi: The Labyrinth of Magi was a very enjoyable show from beginning to end, and I highly recommend it.\r\nStory: 9\r\nMagi will most likely differ from your expectations when you first go into watching it. The Thousand and One Nights influence is really just an influence. The show borrow elements from it but is ultimately an original piece. The setup had great potential to it and the ending leaves many questions unanswered. I didn't see any obvious flaws in the story, and I hope the next (mostly likely a few more) seasons will answer some of the questions presented. I really can't say anything about theplot that doesn't spoil the show. The pacing was slow at the start, but picks of the pace very quickly.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\\n\r\nAnimation was nice, pretty good for a 25 episode season. Relatively fluid but sometimes i felt that the budget could be more prioritized. The dance scenes are usually well animated in other shows but in this, it felt choppier than usual. The quality of the animation in the opening is about what you get throughout. One part about the drawing style that took a bit of getting used to was the teeth: it always seems to me they were wearing mouth guards all the time. But overall, nothing huge to complain about, but doesn't really bring anything new to the table.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtracks were pretty nice. The variety of arabian themed music to hot blooded techno during some fights were interesting to listen to. The openings and endings were great. This is one of the only shows where I actually listen to the whole of the ending every time. I have always been a fan of Supercell's, and this time, with The Bravery serving as the second ending theme. Aladdin's seiyu was a bit too girly for me, and it was really obvious most of the time that the seiyu was a girl. Yuki Kaji did a great job for Alibaba, no complaints there.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\\n\r\nThey all got some character development most of the time, and were enjoyable to watch. Sometimes, though, one of the main trio wouldn't even appear in an episode because of the different allocations of development. However, it was still nice to see some of the minor characters get a chance in the lime light.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10 Overall: 9\\n\\n\r\nA very enjoyable show that doesn't require a whole lot of thinking. Strongly recommended.",

Which I constantly heard that it was adapted badly with missing chapters but after all I am just giving my impression about the anime itself.\r\nStory 8/10\r\nOK in short , the Dungeon stuff is really good , this series needs more dungeon exploring , I like how creative it could get , and the whole fight through the dungeon to get treasure and Djinn power , The conflict concerning Kou empireand other cities such as Balbadd and Sindria is totally good , however it failed twice to give me hype concerning the real main fights which I am really concerned of , the reason of that is how the character development goes, and a story which runs at a global scale is affected by someone's development which was pretty generic. The Mysterious organization failed to give me any hype because I am only seeing people overcome their odds with things I have heard time and time again , I may be a little harsh though.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\r\nOK during the first 10 episodes where the story was golden , it wasn't the same animation wise , a lot of lazy drawings were noticed during its first run , in the last 15 episodes the art became a lot better , and was an eye candy to me.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\r\nThe Openings are pretty good , and the Voice actors are good , the Soundtracks in this season are dull.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10\\n\r\nMorgiana is decent , Aladdin is great , Alibaba is too clich\u00e9 that his development isn't investing me in it. But characters Like Sinbad are amazing enough to invest me into him, Judal's character too , It is more of a mixed bag to me.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10\\n\r\nOK in short I enjoyed episodes 1-10 at the fullest , 11-14 were slow but had a lot of hype which ended up being for nothing , the show picks up again when it goes for the second dungeon and invests me again into it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8 + 8 + 7 + 7 + 8)/5 = 7.6\\n\r\nCeiling 7.6 is 8\\n\r\nso it is an 8/10 (Very Good)\\n",

            "content": "Halfway point review of Magi (mostly spoiler free; I talk vaguely about key themes of the show)\r\nAll my expectations going in for this series have simply been blown away since my watch through so far. Judging the book by its cover, I had pretty bad assumptions about the show, specifically thinking that the art style gave me this \"4kids One Piece dub\" vibe and that I would be hard pressed to find any interesting action or sense of danger from this show. Man, am I happy that I was wrong. It's really refreshing watching a shounen that's willing to include darker content (like slavery andcharacters actually dying in battle) without having to be edgy at all..\\n\\n\r\nI've watched more than my fair share of shounens, and frankly I've enjoyed a lot of them, but have slowly and gradually developed a bitterness to the typical bland and easy to predict plots of said shounens, but--from where I've watched so far--Magi is extremely difficult to predict; and I love it!\\n\r\nHell, they even poke fun at that and throw in some hilarious comedy scenes just to throw you off of things early on.\\n\\n\r\nOne of my favorite things about this series is that it gives a feeling of being but a tiny fish in a big pond. The main characters aren't absurdly OP compared to the others, and it really gives me this kind of \"larger picture\" or world building theme, similar to Hunter x Hunter, and you really get to love watching these characters integrate into the new world before them (rather than just getting a villain of the week type of show).\\n\\n\\n\r\nPretty much if you want an action show with real plot twists and interesting world building, just start watching already.\\n\\n\r\n(again this is a partial review; take it how it is)",

            "content": "Yup, I almost never write reviews but I hope this one will help. So before watching this anime series, I asked for some reviews and thoughts on this series. Many were like 'no, read the manga instead, you won't like this anime'. I tended to believe all those negative reviews, and this sentiment was further reinforced by the fact that this series seemed like another magic/fairy tale-like anime to me, which might turn out to be too childish. Guess what? I read the manga and watched the anime and it was pretty amazing. I know things like \"household vessels\" were thrown at us already inthe very beginning, but a real otaku could overcome that very easily and just continue following with the series. Of course the manga readers had an advance, but that doesn't mean you won't like this series. This series is definitely WORTH A WATCH.\\n\\n\r\nStory 8/10 - The story was in my opinion pretty awesome. It takes some good imagination to create such a story and it wasn't that difficult to understand.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10 - I really don't have anything bad to say about the art, it was simply beautiful and (major) flaws were nowhere to be found.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10 - I really liked the OSTs. I must say, I wanted more Japanese-like OSTs in the beginning, but it's just something you get used to in my opinion. Sometimes it just doesn't go along well with the theme, a story which was set in this Arab-like world. The voices were also fitting the characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10 - The character development could have been better. We didn't get to see some characters develop until the last couple of episodes for example. I still liked the main characters though...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10 - I can most certainly say this was one of my favorite, enjoyable anime series from last season and I am glad there will be a second season. I used to look forward to every new episode.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10 - Magi was a good anime series and in some ways it might have been a let-down, but then again, the story was pretty amazing. \\n\\n\r\nFor the ones out there that are still hesitating, just give it a try and see for yourself whether you like it or not, as I said before, it is definitely worth a watch!",

            "content": "As I write this review I want to say that I have not read the manga and I'm currently ending the second season of this show. \r\nThis anime was constantly suggested to me by one of my friends and I refused to watch it when she initially talked to me about the show because I am incredibly picky and conscious about the media I consume. That being said, I regret not getting into this anime sooner. Magi is incredible. Maybe I'm just saying that because I'm so jaded from all the mediocre animes being praised these days (not that anime has never been mediocre lmao),but I wholeheartedly believe this series is incredible and if the anime is really a bad adaption of the manga then I can't wait to start reading. \\n\\n\r\nMagi's world is based off of the real world and real geography (Alibaba, Aladdin, and Morgiana should all be shades of brown and not so pale it hurts my eyes). The main characters are based off of the Arabian Nights tales which include \"Ali Baba and the forty thieves\", \"Aladdin's Wonderful Lamp\", etc. However, the show isn't a combination of these stories. It simply borrows names and ideas from these old tales and creates an entirely new world of its own. \\n\\n\r\nMagi initially gives the impression that it will be a typical shounen anime powered by platonic friendships, but it's not. Magi is not a typical, boring shounen. The first couple episodes that scream shounen aren't even boring. As you delve deeper you learn more about Magi's world and politics which makes the show increasingly more interesting. It reminds me of a good video game. You start out meeting Alibaba and then Alibaba meets Aladdin. Alibaba explains to Aladdin that he wants to capture a dungeon. Capturing a dungeon is dangerous, but, if successful, one can become rich and be granted special powers. Though, most people capture dungeons for the powers granted to them by djinn in the dungeon rather than chase the wealth. \\n\\n\r\nDungeons are erected by magi who usually lead people to these dungeons. People who successfully capture a dungeon and have a metal vessel are called King Candidates. In order to use this power, however, the King Candidates must use their magoi (essentially life energy). Some people have more than others and the magi of the world have unlimited access to magoi given to them by the rukh. \\n\\n\r\nMagi also makes commentary on racial prejudice aka racism (though I see this more in season 2), classism, etc. \\n\\n\r\nNow on to the art. It's good. It's not amazing or revolutionary, but it certainly doesn't hurt the eyes. Like I mentioned before, however, the main characters, despite being middle eastern are super pale and I could never find a legitimate reason for why that is. There's only one group of brown people in the show and they come from basically what is Egypt in the magi world, but everyone else is super pale (before anyone says anything, yes, I know that there are countries based off on Europe and East Asia). That's probably the biggest issue I have for the show. \\n\\n\r\nSound is also good. The music is pleasant and usually fitting for the scene, but it's not deserving of any more than a 7. I've heard better music, but Magi's ost is still good. \\n\\n\r\nI gave character a 9 because of the amazing character development throughout the entire series. Things aren't as black and white as they seem and I found myself confused and unsure of what to think at times, because of conflicting opinions and views. Sure, you can simply agree with the protagonist all the time, but what happens when the protagonist is even unsure of what to think? Foes become friends. Friends become foes. \\n\\n\r\nDid I enjoy Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic? Yes. Absolutely. I've been recommending it so many of my friends. I'm recommending it to you right now. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, a 9/10.",

            "content": "Right off the bat this anime gets points in originality for embracing an Arabian theme while still intertwining many other themes like Japanese and Roman. Although it still grounds itself in fantasy standards like magic and the fire/water/earth/wind circle it creates many new ideas that are only found in Magi, blending it all together seamlessly.\r\nThe atmosphere of the series is probably one of the best things about it, being very light-hearted and comical before quickly drawing back to reality often in a deadly serious manner. One minute the focus will be a few friends enjoying themselves and the next will be the necessary evils andinevitable poverty that plagues the world. This is all aided by Magi's fluid animation and incredible splash of colors that just makes it a beautiful sight to see. You can notice how colorful and diverse the different characters are in the series, while also see the darker parts of the show shown in a much darker tone -- often in pure black itself.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Magi is just an enjoyable series, giving you a pleasant experience while also asking some serious questions about things like poverty and how wealth is divided in society.",

This anime is a great representative of how fantasy should be, which is, a genre that envelopes the audience making them want to be apart of this world, however, it is also supported by other dark underlying themes, making it somewhat a reflection of reality, but a reality as such that if you have determination you can change it to a nice outcome. At first you'd think that it's a fluffy, light anime because of the comedy, but as the story progresses you realise that it isn't. \r\nThe theme of magic and good is embodied by the character: Alaadin, a boy so adorable, youjust cannot hate. He helps establish the theme of friendship, which in turn helps make the audience understand and appreciate the importance of it. Alibaba, the main protagonist is a nice representation of determination, at first, he might appear as a flat character, but later you'll learn what the struggles he underwent and soon you'll begin to appreciate him. Other characters like Morgiana also contribute to the main themes of the anime, while others (dark ones) try to undermine it, all of whom help make Magi the anime that it is. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime can be described with one conclusive adjective: fun.",

I had this weird notion of a really boring story-line but thought I might as well give it a shot because the art looked nice.\r\nI am so glad I did. Magi is an excellent show. \r\nStory-9\r\nAladdin, the main character is not sure what he is and searches for that answer. He discovers that he is a Magi as wellas finding new friends and goes on adventures. The adventures are fun and entertaining and great to watch. \\n\\n\r\nArt-9\\n\r\nFabulous art style. The characters look very realistic and well proportioned and the background looks wonderful. The fights are very pleasing to watch and look really good. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters-9\\n\r\nThe characters are really well developed and each have their own objectives. Though there are many characters, it focuses on a few main characters. Firstly, Aladdin, supposedly a super powerful Magi dude who chooses kings is a tiny pipsqueak with blue hair and likes to eat- A LOT. He has a flute and calls out a blue genie with no head. He is very funny, fun and exciting to watch as he interacts with other characters as he does not fully understand the rules and customs of the world. There is also Morgiana who is a traumatized slave and a powerful fighter. She is more serious and dark but fun and beginning to correct her ways. Lastly Alibaba who has a motive but changes with his interaction with Aladdin.\\n\\n\r\nPoint- the characters are round fun and interesting to watch. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 9\\n\r\nI am one of those people who really loves the big 3 and action anime where a character grows fights grows fights etc. I get the same vibe as I watch Magi and enjoy the battles however there is a lot more comedy, faster pace and character interaction which I find nice as a change. It is very enjoyable and fun.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-9\\n\r\nIt is a very fun and worthy watch if you are looking for a lighthearted anime which you can just shut off your brain and enjoy. If you liked the big 3 or would like it if it were shortened then this is definitely for you. A fun adventure tale which mixes with comedy. You should definitely try this.",

            "content": "Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic is an ambitious fantasy show that attempts to tackle a myriad of political and social issues, but ultimately falls flat with poor pacing, lackluster dialogue, and confusing tonal shifts.\r\nAs a disclaimer, I have not read the manga, and this review is solely based on the English dub of the anime adaptation of this series's first season. It is possible that my issues with character dialogue may not be as prevalent in the sub. \r\nThis show intrigued me early on with its interesting character designs and a creative approach to the characters from One Thousand and One Nights. Unfortunately, the storyis so scatterbrained that it fails to support the characters well at all. The three main characters Aladdin, Alibaba, and Morgiana do have some degree of development throughout the series, but for the most part they each remain one-note and predictable from beginning to end. The two OPs in this series imply that the main trio will be going on a lot of exciting adventures together, but this is very misleading. For a significant portion of the story, the three of them are separated and dealing with their own sub-plots, which severely hampers the pacing early on. Each sub-plot is handled on an individual basis and mostly acts as setup for later character motivations. Most of the characters that appear in this early section of the story are dropped completely as well, never to be seen again. \\n\\n\r\nI nearly dropped the series about halfway through because the story didn't seem to know what it wanted to be. This show was at its strongest when it was being a fun action adventure story, but it seemed more concerned with ham-fistedly preaching the horrors of slavery and class warfare. That's not to say these are bad topics to explore, but they are handled very poorly here. The show often takes itself too seriously and it's clear that the writing cannot support that kind of tone for very long without crumbling under its own weight. About two thirds into the show, these themes are given much less attention and the characters are finally given an opportunity to breathe. The writing and pacing continues to be inconsistent, but the occasional fun character interaction kept me going til the end. That is, when the dialogue isn't being completely dull. \\n\\n\r\nThe poorly-written dialogue is a major factor in why this show did not manage to support its heavier themes. The subject matter is oftentimes directed at teenagers and young adults, but the dialogue is written as if it's made for children. There is very little subtlety, and characters phrase a lot of things in bafflingly moronic ways. It makes the characters seem less intelligent and it drags down major story moments that might otherwise be more engaging.  \\n\\n\r\nThe animation was completely serviceable on the whole, with equal moments of occasional good and bad animation. It became apparent that the budget was being saved for major action scenes, and some smaller scenes suffer as a result. The character designs are simple enough to be easy on the animators, but not so simple that they clash with the tone of the story. However, there are occasional \"chibi\" moments where characters begin acting in comically exaggerated ways, and this does sometimes clash with the otherwise serious tone of the story. This is, however, mostly an issue when the story is taking on a serious tone, and the tone of this story is all over the place.\\n\\n\r\nThis clash of tone is most evident in the character of Aladdin. He is a wise young child who still looks at the world with child-like optimism and innocence. He is very kind and polite, and is seriously troubled to see others being mistreated. However, Aladdin is also aggressively perverted, often finding any opportunity to get his face all up in some woman's business. There is nothing about his personality or history that we are given to explain why he might be this way, and so it feels completely out of character every time.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast outside of the main three are numerous and very hit-and-miss. As stated before, many characters are dropped from the story completely early on, so they don't get much development. Most of the villains are also very one-note, and can be summed up as self-entitled assholes with little to no redeeming qualities. There are a couple stand-out villains, but their development is handled very sloppily amidst the poor writing and pacing. There were two supporting characters that stand out among the rest, Sinbad and the princess Kougyoku. Their interactions in the second half of the show are a highlight that managed to keep me invested.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is very good, though the tracks themselves are often misused. There is a wide variety of music at use here, from rock to techno to John Williams-esque orchestra. There is little consistency between the genres at use here, and there were many moments where the music didn't seem to match what was happening on screen. At least it was all nice to listen to. the OP and ED songs were also pretty good, and I found myself humming along to them before too long. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic is a fairly mediocre show. There is enjoyment to be found is some of the characters, but they get bogged down by poorly-written dialogue, heavy-handed political and social messages, and horrible pacing and direction. If you can look past these issues, you may find a lot of enjoyment in this show. I can't say that this would be a good introduction to anime or even the Shounen genre, despite the relatively Western subject matter, as there are better written shows out there that would be more suited to that.",

            "content": "Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic Review\r\nStory (8/10) Very Good\r\nFrom the first 3 episode honestly I thought it was ok I didn't see anything super special it wasn't until around episode 5 or 6 basically when Judar was introduced when I felt the story picked up some pace and took off like a rocket-ship. I enjoyed every bit of this season after that point. And I indeed heard that A-1 Picture adapted about 109 chapters of the manga into 25 episodes and I hear apparently there are people out there that didn't sit well with that. I do agree some events felt like that took placejust a bit too fast, but as an anime only watcher (up to this point of writing this review that is..) I felt even though those events took place a lot faster than it did in the manga I didn't feel it was rushed. Because to me when you bring in the word \"rushed\" that's a negative and I felt the pacing decision that A-1 Pictures decided to go with can be forgiven, if I read the manga maybe I would feel differently but it is what it is I can look past this. I also heard when it came to episode 24 a lot of changes were made I'm going to spoil too much but I'm talking about the whole Sasuke like curse-mark and dark transformation moment Ali Baba had. Like said I do feel when it came to 25 episodes they wanted it to feel conclusive and climatic when it comes to ending a season off, maybe in the manga how that arc ended they felt wouldn't have left people feeling as hyped to watch anymore of Magi after that I have no clue I'm just assuming, but once again I can forgive that also. This is the mindset I'm coming from here so HEAR ME OUT. Which one would you have preferred? \\n\\n\r\nA) They stick too the manga, not have 25 episodes in one season and don't make any changes? Because if you choose this option you have to take into consideration that with 25 episodes they are able to make this look this good A-1 Pictures is known for having great art style and animation in their adaptations and if they didn't cut it off at 25 episodes and take a break, come back and to another (which is what they have been doing) then we would see the Toei effect which is basically taking no breaks and having good episodes every once and a while and many other episodes get butchered.\\n\\n\r\nor \\n\\n\r\nB) What they are doing now. (Exactly my point I can sacrifice a little bit of the story being changed and it being quicken just a tad bit versus getting a shitty adaptation all together this world isn't perfect and you have to pick your poison every studio isn't Madhouse who can make 148 flawless episodes of HxH)\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt (10/10) Masterpiece\\n\\n\r\nA-1 Pictures did an outstanding job with the art in the anime, there's no issue what so ever I had with it. Characters as far as their manga counterparts that I've seen here and there for example Hakuryuu don't look exactly how they look in the manga but it isn't anything to complain about to take off points in my opinion. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10) Masterpiece\\n\\n\r\nNo issues here either the openings are outstanding the sound effects were great everything perfect in the section also. Now these days if you can't get this category right then just quit lol.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (8/10) Very Good\\n\r\nMore Specifically (8.75/10) \\n\\n\r\nDamn near all of the characters are unique, interesting and most importantly bad ass. I think they are all good the only character that disappointed me was Hakuryuu not going to spoil anything about him but the if you've watched the anime I think you know what scene I'm talking about (cry baby..) anyway everyone else lived up to the expectation I had for the just off of first glance. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10) Very Good\\n\\n\r\nLike I said in the story section those first like 4 or 5 episodes my enjoyment was around a 7 at best which is why I can't give this a 10 personally. I understand majority of anime has a slow start but I can't forgive that beginning for me personally. I didn't think the hype behind the anime was real until episode 6. So it is was it is a 8 is still good everything else in the anime please me fairly.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10)\\n\r\nMore Specifically (8.95/10)\\n\\n\r\nI felt Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic was very very good and it honestly. I can't wait to watch season 2 (which I heard is even better than this 1) and get caught up with the manga (which I heard is HYPE right now) before season 3 hopefully starts.",

            "content": "The \"Magi\" series is highly ranked here on MAL, and I definitely understand why. It has a unique style and manages to combine sweet moments, great action, fantastic adventures, mystery, character development and world building in a amazing way. Biased as a may be, I\u00b4ill do my best to be as objective and constructive as possible in my review of \"Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic\". The score is for the show as a piece of all the seasons + \"up to date manga\", do to that I try to see how good the piece in the puzzle works. And I think it works really well.Well let\u00b4s dig in!\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\r\nLoosely based on the \"1000 and one night\" characters and Arabic mythology, we have a pretty unique anime/manga setting. But this is not a copy work - when I say loosely based I mean very loosely. The world is completely fantasy, with it\u00b4s own continents, lands, empires, djinns, dungeons and magic. Not only have we Arabic influences but also Chinese (The Koh Empire), roman (The Rem Empire), Mongolian (The Mountain Horse tribes) and so on. That makes up for a chessboard of many different agendas and conflicts.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing you should know, that the first 10 or so episodes aren\u00b4t that action packed. So if you are going in to this one because of the action tag - you will have to wait a bit for the action to really get going. I\u00b4m not saying the first bit doesn\u00b4t contain action - it\u00b4s just not in the focus yet. And when the real action is brought into the mix, well let\u00b4s say it\u00b4s really good, much because of the suspense and tension that has been building up right to that point. Most battles are magic based which gives us some epic showdowns. The first part of the story are mainly focused on introducing and getting to know the characters (and it\u00b4s quite a few), lay out the main plot and on world building. The show many times has a sweet and adorable touch to it, that makes the more intense, dark and emotional aspects of the show more highlighted (at least for me). \"Magi\" is equally character and plot driven in my opinion - the two bears one another very well. What I mean is that characters develops much to the plot, and that the many great characters really makes the story shine (don\u00b4t know how else to put it). \\n\\n\r\nIn \"Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic\" we are introduced the concepts of the dungeons, djinns and what\u00b4s happen when you capture them, the main characters meeting and growing friendship, the Magi\u00b4s (their origin will be much of a mystery until the third season) and the kings candidates, the political power struggles within and between different empires and kingdoms, and the growth and development of the main characters (Alibaba, Aladdin and Morgiana). The magic aspects of the show is actually very well thought throw, and given time explained in detail (more so in \"Magi:The Kingdom of magic\"). And I like the fact that just because someone gained a djinn they are not automatically over powered - it dosen\u00b4t work like that, the users have to train really hard to master their djinns powers. The same goes for the magic users and fanalis (a race of crazy strong people - Morgiana is one of them), which leaves room for the character to really grow and believable become stronger and face difficulties in a realistic way. That together with the dungeon capturing, really fills out the \"Adventure\" label in a great way. The show lays a heavy weight on the strength of friendship, the cost of freedom and making the right decision, and that nothing comes for free - you have to fight for what you believe in. Something I really appreciate with the show is that it doesn\u00b4t simplify situations - every choice the character has to make has consequences. This is not the type of show that settle all matters with just one battle, and everybody\u00b4s happy and goes home. No, each choice of action is followed up with some realistic consequences. The political systems and hierarchy is as complicated and detailed as in our world. This adds to a very nice world building - you really get a since of how it works and the logic behind it. I think that was awesome, it brought a lot of the depth to the story.\\n\\n\r\nYou also should have in mined that this in the end is gonna be a long running show (100 or so episodes), so \"Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic\" is the beginning of this great adventure. Another thing is that this show has a heavy focus on the impotence of friendship, so if you not dig themes like that you may have problem with it. I personally think their friendship are great, and that many people out there should learn from them. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nThe art is in my opinion freaking great. A-1 Pictures is behind \"Magi\" and have done a absolutely outstanding job with it. Not only have they stayed true to the manga\u00b4s art, but also really brought it to life. The colors are strong and vibrant, the motions is fluid, the light setting gorgeous, and the character are well designed with personal traits. Ooh the colors... Not only are the bright colors used on the characters, but in every panel (backgrounds, magic etc.). Everything from the hair colors (Morginas bright pink, Aladdins intense blue and Sinbads dark purple) to vivid towns and sun settings - is absolutely beautiful. The backgrounds are all very detailed and fits the story and it\u00b4s characters brilliantly. The thing with the characters is that they have a unique look to them, so you instantly now that this is a character from Magi. No paper-cut boards from anywhere. The magic and action scenes are really well done - they are all very fluid with nice angles and motions. I especially enjoyed Morgianas fight scenes, her fighting technique is awesome on screen. The best thing with the animation for me was the \"ruugh\" scenes. They really amplifies the mystic of the magic and are right down awesome - you have to see them for yourself, they are gorgeous. And the art is deliberately goofy in the more comical moments - it is supposed to be that way. All over I\u00b4m really pleased with the art and animation, I have no complaints what so ever with it. Keep up the good work for the next season!\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nYep, yet again a 10. And I\u00b4m very serious when it comes to the music in a show. Displeasing or unfitting music can easily ruin a show for me. But I absolutely love the soundtrack for \"Magi\". It\u00b4s suiting, well coordinated and are managing to bring out the emotions that the scenes was meant to create - brilliant. For the more action oriented scenes we have rock music, often with vocals. The songs are really great - I still listen to them, it still makes my heart pump faster (for example \"Enfin apparu!!\", \"A storm is coming for us all\" and \"Vasle Hot\"). For the more easy going moments we have more goofy-happy music and for some emotional moments we have some dramatic classical music with a \"Magi-feeling\" to it (you will know what I mean). And of course we have some Arabic influenced music, they are all great (I espacially enjoyed the song Morgiana dances to, when she\u00b4s finally able to let her self be happy and feel her freedom - they totally nailed that one). \\n\\n\r\nFor the the two OP\u00b4s, I can say really liked them as well. They are catchy, fast going and vibrant with a happy undertone - perfectly for this kind of colorful adventure story. Together with some nice visuals they set the perfect \"Magi\"-mood, and letting you get reminded of that you are in for a ride. As for The ED\u00b4s I wasn\u00b4t a fan of the first one (a bit to edgy for me), but I liked the visuals. For the second ED I really liked it. Up beat with a sad/dramatic undertone, It really hit home to me. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nThe 10 is raining down on \"Magi\" from me. But as for the rest I do have my reasons. The first thing is that I can really feel the characters personalities, and that they seldom do things that is out of character for them. There is no overdone arch/stereotypes or 2-denominational characters in \"Magi\". They have distinct believable personalities that doesn\u00b4t feel unrealistic or overdone. Their past has of course made them who they are, but it doesn\u00b4t stop there. For a show that has so many different and colorful characters, they all feel needed and have a role to fill in some way. The character development is quite frank outstanding - especially for our three mains (Aladdin, Alibaba and Morgiana) in this season. The characters learn from each mistake, each hardship and each adventure. They think and reflect, and it\u00b4s making them grow at a very high rate - but they never loses their personalities. Which I think is great, the main trio compliments each other very well. They have a great dynamic that always progresses forward. Even the \"enemies\" are strong characters with motives, and their own view on the world. You seldom find a character in \"Magi\", with the only reason to act like they do because they are evil. They always have an agenda or reason - even if it is a simple one or one to be uncovered later. We get to follow a lot of plot important characters, so keep your eyes open - conversations and such between new faces that can appear to be random, are often not. It\u00b4s giving away clues to the plot and the characters role in it. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u00b4s hard to really lift my points on why I loved all the characters in \"Magi\" so much without spoiling anything. So I leave it at that so can you see for your self.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI enjoyed every second of \"Magi\". Everything from the interesting plot, awesome characters, fantastic music and brilliant animation. One of my favorite shows so far, and I don\u00b4t think that\u00b4s ever gonna change. I base a lot of final scores on all over enjoyment despite flaws and such, but in \"Magi\u00b4s\" case I can\u00b4t fined any such things. Every piece that\u00b4s makes a great anime for me was there. Enjoyment is a understatement - It\u00b4s was an unforgettable experience for me. Loved every second of it. I laughed, I cried, I was exited, and I was intrigued when I was watching this. It fore shore left me emotionally touched and eager to jump on the next season. Just how I wan\u00b4t a show to make me feel. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nGreat storytelling, world building, characters and animation has put the Magi series up in the top, and it really deserves it. It has an unique feeling to it - I call it the \"Magi\" feeling. Nothing feels like a cheap copy of something else, the usual tropes are absent, and the characters has real depth. Not to mention that it\u00b4s actually containing some well fitted comedy. Magi definitely fills out it\u00b4s labels in interesting content and lives up to it\u00b4s high scores ( I personally think it\u00b4s deserve even a better one). I can\u00b4t freaking wait for season 3, it\u00b4s enough source material out now so it should be expected in a year or two. If you are in to adventure story\u00b4s in a fantasy environment with a healthy does of action and magic, well this fore shore the show for you.   \\n\\n",

            "content": "This is an otherwise amazing series, worthy of a \"9\" rating that suffers from regrettable instances where unwanted sexual advances are normalized, the objectification of women is present through out-of-place harem situations and unpleasant character reactions to female 'ugliness' (as per the show's standard's of beauty), and a massive amount of cultural appropriation, vis a vis the absence of any Middle-Eastern looking characters in a setting that is very obviously based on Arabia (and, therefore, the Asiatic Middle-East.) These problems have the potential to launch certain viewers out of the story, while normalizing for others harmful social views that they might already hold (without offeringany voice of opposition.)\\n\\n\r\nI don't want to fixate /solely/ on these problems, as the series, insofar as characters, art and sound are truly great, particularly the characters from a developmental standpoint. And the overall emotional tone and pacing of the series is executed to near perfection. Overall, it is a series that I would have liked to have in the top bracket of series that I've watched, but it's perhaps because it is otherwise so good that these types of unfortunate representations of marginalized social groups leaves such a bad taste in my mouth. If the whole product were bad, I could just dismiss these as part of the unsatisfactory package, but in this case, I can't. That is why, although I adore many aspects of this series, I am forced to give it an \"8\" instead of a \"9,\" and I feel that that's a very lenient deduction for how glaring these problems are.",

            "content": "Overall, I would say that this is a show worth watching. I feel like it presents a kind of unique cast of characters, and it introduces them relatively gradually, so it's pretty easy to keep track of everyone. It really gives you time to connect with the characters, so the things that happen to them mean more to the viewer. I think the anime was pretty well drawn. It transitioned well from manga to anime without losing a lot of details, and the music was engaging if not a little over dramatic at parts. I was also a fan of a lot of the voiceactors, so that was a huge plus as well. \\n\\n\r\nI read the manga before I watched the anime, and for the most part, the anime follows the manga pretty closely, which I appreciate. The only real issue I had is that the last three or four episodes progressively work in more and more filler, and while I understand that this was probably done because the manga is still in publication, I feel that the direction that they went with it all was kind of silly. Overall, though, it's not the worst filler I've ever seen, and it didn't take away too much from the story.",

            "content": "In a world where labyrinths, heroes and slavery exist side by side, Magi attempts to create an understanding of this sphere while bringing to life my childhood favorite characters.\r\nIn some ways, Magi is absolutely brilliant. Its music is gorgeous and I regularly feel dreamy while watching the show thanks to its spectacular background music. The character designs are adorable, and for someone who regularly complains about the lack of strong female characters in a show, Magi has turned out to be something I can point people towards should they want to see strong female characters.\r\nThe main story line seems to be following one that wouldappeal to both younger and somewhat older audiences, it has both a childish enthusiasm and a rather slow but definite development of characters in it.\\n\\n\r\nSome of the themes it deals with, 'betrayal' seems to be a strong one in the current arc (I'm on episode 10), can get grating at times. However the show tries to show everyone as characters of their own, and has developed starting plot lines for each of them. Given the fact that it has only been ten episodes, that is an accomplishment.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, not everything is perfect. Like all shows, this too has its weak points. The pivotal one among them being the inability to understand what exactly motivates a character to do what they are doing. This has happened at least thrice to me now, and even so, I am wiling to bypass that part and hope that there will be some clarification in the future which doesn't imply that it was done simply because the character was being 'eccentric', or to put it more simply 'one dimensional'. \\n\\n\r\nAnother part of Magi that irritates me a lot is how they deal with the societal conditions prevalent in the background of the premise. It somehow comes of as lackluster and badly researched. Perhaps it could have helped if they either avoided bringing up the subject completely, or handled it more effectively. And I'm absolutely convinced they could have done the latter, the way Morgiana's story was handled shows much of what they could have done. Though it was barely brought up, par a few episodes, she remains one of the most sympathetic and strongest characters in the show.\\n\\n\r\nSo, to sum up-\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10. It's a very new twist to age old stories and I love what they have done with it. It's refreshing, makes me want to go back and read my childhood books again and when I do, trust me, I will probably see everything in a different light.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10. Light, vibrant, and full of energy. That is how I see the artwork behind the series. The desert backgrounds and locales are beautiful to look at and there is a lot of attention given to detail.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10. Here, when I talk about the sound, I strictly mean the background music. The opening and ending themes weren't to my style, but that in no way implies that they weren't good either. It's simply that I love the background music far too much.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10. Here is where I was a bit disappointed. Some characters left me surprised and wanting to see more, while others made me want to throw a shoe at my screen. However, each character in their own right is brilliant, and I'm sure if they were given a chance to shine, they would do just that.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10. When I have a love-hate relationship with a series, and I still go back to watch it every week, I know I enjoy it. The series has a good balance, it gets somewhat tipsy at times, certain scenes such as Aladdin's umm... fondness... for certain... female body parts made me cringe. Simply because he looked too young for it. I don't care what his age is, he just looks too young for that. O_O But thankfully the latest episodes don't feature many scenes of said fondness. Overall, the series is pleasant to watch if you take it with a grain of salt.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10. When a series has so many things I both love and hate - this happens. However, I would encourage anyone and everyone to at least give the series a try. :)",

            "content": "Magi is, according to numerous lists, one of the very best adventure anime of all time. If that is the perception of the majority of the community I'd definitely argue this show is considerably overrated. That being said, while it certainly is not without flaws, which I'll be addressing shortly, it's an overall GOOD show, though in my opinion not a GREAT one, and it's probably worth a look for fans of the genre.\r\nArt-\r\nThis anime is fine visually, but, considering it's a modern anime (2012) it really isn't anything special compared to other products of its time. What you get here is pretty run ofthe mill for a non low budget anime from this time period. I cannot think of any scenes that blew me away visually but the anime isn't ever ugly either. Some of the characters have ridiculous designs, but this is a deliberate decision.\\n\\n\r\nSound-\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion the single strongest element of the show is it's phenomenal background music, which I'd rate a slam dunk 10/10. It was varied, it was scene appropriate and it was very high quality. Environmental scenes had beautiful Arabian sounding music that perfectly fit the locale. Battle scenes had uptempo, evocative music that always felt like it was integrated masterfully into the scene. Sad moments had dramatic, sullen music to really fit the mood. \\n\\n\r\nA side note that really impresses me about the music is the fact that it felt like the music was actually designed to be background music, which feels uncommon in anime these days. Often times a song is designed to be, well, a song, and they simply cut it and play part of it in the background of whatever scene. In this case it felt like the music was designed specifically to fit the scenes as opposed to being intended to be listened to after the fact as a standalone product and they really nailed it.\\n\\n\r\nAfter all those compliments, here's some negativity to counteract it- As lovely as the background music was, the voice acting was very average. None of the important characters have accompanying standout voice performances and some of the less important characters, villains in particular, have super cringe inducing, blatantly over the top, ridiculous voices. \\n\\n\r\nA somewhat disturbing pattern I noticed is that several of the villains have voices, and sometimes appearances, that came damn near the line of outright mockery of a stereotypical homosexual person. It felt like the director or the person in charge of casting the voice actors was making a point to get a dig in at that community, which is something I don't support or appreciate at all. One male villain who was blatantly afeminine and wore lipstick and such had a voice that bordered on degrading and likewise a different male villain- a character clearly designed to come off as a jerk and be disliked- had a massive lisp and talked in an odd and potentially suggestive way. If these implications were intentional, shame on them.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter/Story-\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are likely the weakest part of Magi as they are, in one word, flat. Character development is lacking in this anime in a big way, which is exasperated by the fairly large size of the cast, and damn near every single character doesn't really have anything more to them than basic emotions and however they appear on the surface. I found it very difficult to connect with or care about any of the characters and none of the moments that were intended to be emotional effected me at all, as I simply didn't care.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime also suffers from pacing issues and perhaps a bit of misleading advertising. For such a highly regarded ADVENTURE anime there really isn't all that much adventure to be had. Many stretches are slow, boring and very dialogue heavy and the middle section of the show is significantly overly drawn out. I thought, based on the synopsis of the anime, I'd be watching a group of characters go from location to location attempting to capture dungeons and obtain the power within, which is a premise I was definitely into, but in reality once the characters leave the initial dungeon in the third or fourth episode they do not return to one again until episode 19, which is a very long stretch of much less exciting things. The fact that the characters only go inside TWO dungeons over a 25 episode stretch was definitely a letdown. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, this anime has a bit of an identity crisis and perhaps isn't self-aware of the way it comes off. There are many childish moments and immature boob references, but then all of a sudden it tries to get really dark. It was very difficult to take the dark moments seriously when the character development was sorely lacking and when the large majority of the show was, clearly, aimed at a young teenage audience. Another thing that worked against the dark moments is that this show is way too afraid to kill off any remotely important characters. Even in its final battle in which in two separate locations a major conflict is occurring- one with 8 good guy generals (many of whom are undeveloped and unimportant) facing off against the army of the bad guys and the other where the main characters fight against a super villain- every single person on the side of the good guys survives and the good guys claim a decisive victory without any consequences or meaningful casualties. The sense of inevitability that the good guys will always win and the main cast of three will, no matter what, absolutely survive through the show and be fine really detracted from any sense of danger or consequence.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-\\n\\n\r\nI didn't specifically dislike watching Magi, and it finished really strong with its final 5 ish episodes being quite good and getting me back into it, but overall I was fairly disappointed given how hyped this show is. If not for the strong final few episodes I'd have given the show a 6. The premise of capturing dungeons in a magic-heavy land is super underutilized and as I mentioned previously the middle section in particular really dragged and got into a very dialogue heavy political type situation, which is not what I want from an adventure anime.\\n\\n\r\nI'm glad I watched the show and I will watch season 2 in the coming months but there is just no way this show is one of the best adventure anime of all time as I've read so many times.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, overrated. More specifically, an interesting but definitely underutilized premise, average voice acting, flat/underdeveloped characters, pacing issues in the middle, ineffective tone shifts and a major case of \"the good guys will always win no matter what\" syndrome backed up by lovely environmental music, a few cool but over the top battle scenes and too many immature scenes that were probably trying, and failing, to be humorous.\\n\\n\r\nWorth a watch but NOT an all time great.\\n\\n\r\n+Some of the best background/environmental music I've ever heard\\n\r\n+Great concept/premise\\n\r\n+Solid battle scenes\\n\\n\r\n-Flat/underdeveloped characters\\n\r\n-Pacing issues\\n\r\n-Tone issues\\n\r\n-No sense of danger or consequence because, no matter what, the good guys will be okay\\n\\n\r\nOBJECTIVE RATING- Weak 7\\n\r\nPERSONAL ENJOYMENT RATING- Strong 6/Weak 7",

Well this show is probably not anywhere near accurate to the original stories but that's perfectly fine. Admittedly I only watched this show because of one of my favorite board games: Arabian Nights and one of my friends jokingly telling me Magi was basically that if it became an anime. This show very much felt like it was checking boxes for adventure shounen story and that's fine with me. I have zero problems with shows that check boxes and does it well. The characters area lot of fun and have good chemistry and the world building while in some areas not the greatest overall well done. Would recommend the dub for Magi, it wasn't the greatest dub I've heard but if your looking for a good dub this one fits the bill.",

It was great moments of seriousness, which contain legitimate tension, and can be fun and heart-warming when its appropriate. The arcs are engaging, well-paced and do not out staytheir welcome; with every single one of them progressing the story and  developing the characters, making you genuinely care for and understand their motivations. \\n\\n\r\nThe colour palette is used very well in the show. The majority of which is very vibrant and bright; which is used in contrast to the protagonists, who are presented as very dark. This helps to emphasise the over-arcing theme of light vs dark and to subtly hint at a characters true intentions. Although the character designs are not always as good as they could be; this is more than made up for by beautiful and grand set-pieces and design of costumes, especially when the 'full-djinn equip' is introduced.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime is extremely entertaining and enjoyable with the interesting story and characters keeping you engaged throughout  the 24 episodes. This is an criminally under-rated anime with a lot of heart which i think more than earns its 9/10 rating",

Never seen one of those before.\" I was honestly expecting a crappier version of Fairy Tail, but honestly, I was very pleasantly surprised how wrong I was!\r\n     STORY 10/10 \r\nI'll start off by saying that one of my favorite things about this series is the first episode. It was brilliantly done. It immediately is interesting. It has scenes that give off a mysterious, badass type of feel thatmake you wanna stick around so you can understand what's going on.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime takes place in what appears to be some sort of alternate, ancient middle east. It follows the story of a boy named Alladin (I know what you're thinking, but this isn't the Disney movie) who uses a wish from a genie to become friends with it and they become traveling companions (Worst wish ever right?). If that alone doesn't make for an interesting story, Alladin is also what is called a \"Magi\", a legendarily talented spellcaster. \\n\\n\r\n     ART 8/10\\n\r\nIt's pretty good. Iv'e seen better though.\\n\\n\r\n     SOUND 8/10\\n\r\nI usually give an 8 as default when the soundtrack doesn't stick out much. If it sticks out because its bad, then I go lower and visa versa. The opening theme is pretty cool though.\\n\\n\r\n     CHARACTER 8.5/10\\n\r\nThis series has extremely well done character development and you can totally see the characters mature as the series progresses. Also, the \"super powers/magic\" in this anime are fairly original! I've never seen anything quite like the abilites that characters possess in this anime. I didn't give a perfect score because I felt that sometimes the characters needed a little more \"life\" in them.\\n\\n\r\n     ENJOYMENT 9/10\\n\r\nOn a scale of 1-10, my enjoyment was a 9. Simple as that.\\n\\n\r\n     OVERALL 9/10\\n\r\nOverall i thoroughly enjoyed this anime and I highly recommend it. It's very different that any anime you've ever seen. That, I can guarantee!",

            "content": "Anime adaptations are understandable to change some plot elements from the adapted medium, because...they're adaptations. Usually it's small, and probably sometimes it's quite big to actually have an impact.\r\nMagi's a mixed bag for me considering some that has been done on it, and I'll get right to it.\r\nShort Warning - A somewhat minor spoiler(?) in Characters' review.\r\nCritical Review:\r\nStory: 6\r\nThe plot is good, and each arc was executed in a timely manner. There wasn't much holes, and most of them were covered properly throughout, and everything progresses forward. While the pacing is somewhat sluggish, everything comes into play quite right.  Of course it's one ofthose magic-ish, fantasy series with made-up ideas, terminologies and such, but they do well in explaining them in +-detail. \\n\\n\r\nIt's not excellent, but overall it holds up fairly well.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nA-1 Pictures is one of the studios I like when it comes to their animation. They vary a lot from the series they have made, must be depending on the animators and budget. The show's character art, normal and fight scenes, they're all pretty good. Effects were noticeable and some parts were really cool.\\n\\n\r\nThere are scenes where the quality drops a bit, and a simple google search would be sufficient of a proof. Overall, though, it A-1 Pictures got a good animation for the most part.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nSound/Effects: \\n\r\nSound was decent, and while Hiromi Kikuta has done some titles like BRS, she did a fair job for Magi, it's not amazing, but it's not bad either.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: \\n\r\nShiro Sagisu, Supercell, they did a pretty decent work on Magi as well. It wasn't memorable unlike their other works with other animes, but it's good enough to get a vibe going.\\n\\n\r\nSeiyuu/VA: \\n\r\nI like the main cast, they have versatile roles in their list and did pretty swell.  Kaori Ishihara made Aladdin one of the most memorable character voices in my head. A-1 Pictures also include top-tier Seiyuus like Kana Hanazawa and Daisuke Ono to make two prominent characters like Kougyouku and Sinbad really fit well in the series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5\\n\r\nThis is where it really flops around me. A-1 Pictures is a good studio, don't get me wrong. But they're sometimes known to do some probably poor adaptation choices when it comes to character plot/development. If rating the character category, most of the score would obviously come from the main cast would it? However, it wouldn't do justice to base the rating just solely on that, but the main cast will still have the most impact concerning the characters' overall premise. \\n\\n\r\nAladdin, and Morgiana, they're a decent main cast, you'll feel for Morgiana, even though she hasn't much going on for her with her after the first arc, Aladdin is one of those characters you can never hate due to his childish innocent personality. While almost the entire cast of Magi is somewhat monotone, because of plot-development, they're a pretty decent bunch, heck Kana Hanazawa's role for Kougyoku stacked up well to actually be one of the most memorable females there. But of course, this can all be ruined by atleast leaving a bad impression on an important character...\\n\\n\r\nI'll be frank here, they nearly destroyed Alibaba's character, which is probably the most frustrating to even talk about since he's the main male lead next to Aladdin. I have said it before, adaptations are understandable to do some tweaks, but comparing the manga counterpart, your normal decent hero with various faults, but still likable, anime Alibaba has been a mixed-bag of emotions riding on a roller coaster. He just kept going down-low instead of being redeemed as a main lead worthy of your attention, instead he has become your mixed generic tropes of \"Fallen Hero\" and \"Heroic B.S.O.D.\" later on the series, and even the others in the main cast couldn't do much for him. While he did come back to his old somewhat happy-go-lucky self, the events that has happened will make you remember him for what he has become, and what his worst personality is that you somewhat hated him.\\n\\n\r\nI'm sorry if this is low for you, but that's just how I see it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nI enjoyed it quite much. The fight scenes were probably the top notch of them all. Alibaba of course had to ruined it for me in the later of the series, but the entirety of the series was actually good enough for me to pick up the manga and read it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6.2 rounding to 6\\n\r\nThis is a pretty good series tbh. I recommend it for people who likes genres like this to pick this up. While you may or may not agree to what I said about the male lead. Don't let that stop you from taking an interest in the series. If you can though, I suggest reading the manga.\\n\r\n--\\n\r\nReviewed on July 19, 2016. Recapped everything through memory. This is my honest review, but there might be some errors due to time gap between my review and the last time I watched it. Don't take my review as the only reference for taking an interest in this series.",

            "content": "Despite being a shounen series at heart, actual fights in Magi tend to stay on the sidelines in comparison to plot and character development, which is a refreshing take on the genre. The main characters were quite endearing right from the first episode, while the support cast of characters were very likable too.\r\nWith the arcs taking place in different parts of the fictional world, it is interesting to see the various cultures in play, along with their own goals and motives. A shame that with only 25 episodes, the plot did feel rushed at points when the lore itself could have enjoyed a closer examination.This is most evident when the show hit a climax during the Balbadd arc, while spending the next few episodes trying to build itself back up for the conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nThe dynamic between Alibaba, Aladdin and Morgiana was what kept me glued to the series, the show did well in exhibiting their growth as characters, as well as justifying their decisions. But just as you would identify with the protagonists, you are just as likely to sympathize with the villains too, thanks to the generous amount of screen time in explaining their history.\\n\\n\r\nIf there was anything worthy of nitpicking, it would have been the sound and music. The \"rukh\" sound effects were way overused and had little variation, while the same voice clips of hounds were used in two separate episodes too to my annoyance. Music wasn't anything to write home about either, when most of them were ambient and unmemorable.\\n\\n\r\nThis animated adaption did deviate from its manga source at points, but it did its best in covering the central story, along with most of the branches. I would recommend a read through of the source material before watching, though it isn't essential.\\n\\n\r\nIn my final summary, hearing \"Alibaba-kun\" uttered by Aladdin for the first time was strangely jarring yet weirdly appropriate, this sums up my feeling towards this show perfectly. Fans of the shounen genre should give this show a chance.",

            "content": "(Minor Spoilers)\r\nMagi: The Labyrinth of Magic was a great ride. If anything, it succeeded very well as a shounen and magic anime. Since most Shounen anime consist of friendships, comedy, ecchi, brave and strong characters, and, of course, fights to keep you at the edge of your seat, it's mostly very enjoyable. I have to say that Magi took all those components and put an equal amount of it in the show, so there was a lot going in it when I watched it. I am a HUGE fan of magic, so of course I thought of giving this show a shot, and magic alwayshas it's own concept or system in different animes so I was confident that I would like it. And I was impressed, unlike most anime that I've seen, Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic was really fun to watch and whilst I mostly never rate anime due to how much I enjoyed it, this one passed.\\n\\n\r\nStory-8\\n\r\nWell, you could just read the summary and get a small insight into the story and what Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic is about. We've got Magi, incredibly rare yet classy and ancient-known magicians. It's common knowledge that there are only, or should be, 3 Magi that exist in the world simultaneously. After they die, 3 new Magi are born (or something, none of that is actually specified). But then we have cute 10 year old Aladdin, a 4th Magi. It's still a mystery whether this Magi should exist or not, but there he is, our MC. For ten years, he lived alone, somewhere where he was isolated. Aladdin only had the company of a \"Djinn\", namely Ugo. Aladdin asks of him to be his friend and he can summon Ugo from his flute. Aladdin wants to explore the world, which is understandable after being alone and trapped for 10 years. He wants to get out, learn more about himself, who he really is and how the world works. Sooner or later, he meets a 17-year old boy Alibaba, who he befriends very quickly and they both pretty much started to get along well. Aladdin causes destruction of some supply cart and Alibaba is responsible to pay for it. He doesn't have the money (being very poor) so he enters a dungeon along with Aladdin, and after that, well.. the adventure gets pretty damn crazy. A lot happens, Alibaba gets his own Djinn, too.\\n\r\nWell, this anime actually has a heavy amount of politics and rebelling. If anything, we go deep into the personal lives of many characters and that just makes you love them more. It might be hard to understand some parts and such in both the Balbadd and Sindria arc but the best you can do is try paying a lot more attention. Other than that, it's really enjoyable. Each fight is something I could watch whole heartedly, and I've laughed a bunch seeing Alibaba and Aladdin's messed up chibis and their pervertedness. There's a lot of feels in this show too, it kind of gets depressing at times and sometimes the show takes you as far as to make you sympathise with a lot of characters. It's definitely got a little, or a lot of comedy, fan service, battles etc.\\n\r\nWe also have the concept of how Magic works in this show. Each living person has a supply of \"Magoi\" in them, it's like a life source, just like Nen from Hunter x Hunter. It's energy which is generated from something called \"Rukh\" which I will get to later. If you run out of it, you die. You can recharge, though. The only way for humans to actually use the Magoi is through specials weapons called Vessels. There are many types of them, and you have to concentrate your Magoi into them to transmute your Magoi into, well, it depends on each individual. We also have Rukh, and it's known as Magoi's most major source and the \"natural phenomenon of the world\". Rukh is known to guide people, people who can accept their fate which is already drawn out from the beginning. Of course, it's not accepted by everybody, and so they do not have Rukh, but \"Black Rukh\". Black Rukh is originated from hatred or resentment. It can be possible to reverse fate with Black Rukh, too. There is a lot more to all this but it's much better to understand all this in the show.\\n\\n\r\nArt-7\\n\r\nI liked the art style. Simple and cute (yes I said cute), it's very similar to other anime like Toradora! too. I loved how each supporting and main character had a unique design to themselves, and you'll see for yourselves. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation-7\\n\r\nThe animation of Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic is certainly the weakest point of the show. Even though it's not bad, the animation during fights are splendid, that I'll tell you, but normally it's very weird.. I don't think I can describe it, but human movements and all that seem unnatural. I mean, I know this is anime but I'm comparing to other anime too.\\n\\n\r\nSound-8\\n\r\nOh I swear, Dansing Bizarre was seriously the coolest Arabian-themed OST I have ever heard. I'll be honest here, ALL of the OSTs were good in this show, they just seemed to match everything so, so nicely. We also have the first opening which has made it's way onto my most favourite opening of all times ;u; \\n\r\nThe voice-acting was very good! At least Aladdin sounded like a kid, that's a relief.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters-10\\n\r\nReally good.There were so many characters in this anime, they all were just so freaking awesome! All of them had a different design, personality and a lot more to themselves. Morgiana, Aladdin and Alibaba made really good MCs for this show, Sinbad, the Eight Generals, Cassim and almost everybody else. I really don't want to say this buuut.. I didn't even dislike any of the characters, at all! \\n\r\nI do want to write a lot more about the characters in this anime but if I did, I think you'd get spoiled, a lot. So I'll stop now.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime so much, I don't even want to critic against it and point out all of it's flaws because it was just that good. I recommend you watch this anime if you're a fan of Shounen and Magic, you wouldn't regret it, that I know.",

            "content": "I didn't expect much from this anime. I read descriptions and thought, alright give it a try. Watch the first episode and bamm I love it.\r\nHere is why:\r\nStory: The overall story is building slowly up, while three epsiodes have their own story related to the main story. So around three epsiodes are playing in the same scenery, sometimes more epsiodes, sometimes less. This makes it a very enjoyable anime to watch. You have a lot of different settings and much variety. Nevertheless they main story is always there, so everything is related to the mainplot. Not the most brilliant story, but really enjoyable. Even thoughthe story often happy and it's rare that some one dies, it the authors made slavery a big part of the first episodes, not funny, but it helps to make it more seriously and to care more for the characters and to hate the antagonists even more.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Oooooh the art. A thing of beauty. Every place is so detailed and everything was made with so much effort. The fight scenes have the right mixture of Stillstanding and awesome animated scenes. If Morgiana fights you will be stunned, sitting in front of your TV amazed by it's poetry in motion.\\n\r\nSome may critize it, but I like the different drawing styles used to express shocking moments in the faces, this makes a lot of the homour, but it's not so often that you are annoyed of it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The Sound is just perfect. The music always brings that arabian nights feeling. Even though I'm not a huge fan of the openings, they are still enjoyable. But the strength is the music in the cites or anywhere else, the immersion of this mesopotaman world is great.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Maybe too many, but hey, everyone is enjoyable and not annoying. I like all main characters and this doesn't happen often.\\n\r\nAlladin is sometimes annoying, but on the other hand one of the written characters I've ever saw. His love for boobies, but also his innocene... I like him, how he handles problems.\\n\\n\r\nAllibaba: I admit, I didn't really liked him the first parts of the season, but somehow I started caring for him dudring the season. \\n\\n\r\nMorgiana: My favourite, I like them all, but Morgiana is my favourite. Her art, her power everything. \\n\\n\r\nIt seems I don't really care for the characters, because I didn't wrote much, right? Well, I want that you discover them for your self.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: If you didn't noticed yet, I love it and I had and have a lot of fun watching it. So please, do yourself a flavour and watch it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I rate it a 10. The very good story, the characters are the only weakness in this anime and this is hating on a high level. Because they are still better than a lot of animes. The Sound and the Art are indeed outstanding and one of the best I've seen in a while. Especially the sound is, at the moment, the best I've seen. And the art is also in the top 3.\\n\r\nIf you aren't sure yet please watch the first epsiode, if you like it, you will like the whole anime, if you don't like it (even though I don't believe that) give the 2nd one a try. At the end, the whole anime is fun and funny. I can only recommend it and it's a shame that it's not as known as it should be.",

Its full of the premise that to protect you\u00b4re friends as it is with many popular mainstream animes. Unfortunatly i dont think this anime has gotten enough praise.

Right now there exist this and a season 2 Magi:Kingdom of magic and an new OVA type series that focuses on the past of one of the future characters that you will meet on the way while you watch this anime.Ooh did i mention that its based on a manga?! so if you\u00b4re intrested in the premise and story but dont want to see the anime first thats fine, i ONLY hope that you will be enjoying tthis as much as i!",

            "content": "After a long hiatus I am back to writing reviews, and this time I\u2019ll be looking at one of those friendship conquers everything anime, Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic. \r\nThe story takes place in an imaginary world based on the medieval Middle East, which is unique in its own right, but sadly that has to be the only unique thing about this anime. We are introduced to our two main protagonists who by a series of encounters, become good friend and embark on an adventure. All of that sound all nice and fun, and I have to say it was a lot of fun towatch, but at no point did it manage to pull me in. The story starts to evolve after the first arc, and I have to say it does improve in many aspects, and tackles many themes rarely found in anime, but unfortunately it was always too predictable and cliche, there was never any suspense, and one could immediately know that friendship will prevail in the end. One thing I have to praise is the pacing as it was surprisingly consistent, and even though there were 25 episodes overall filler episodes were nowhere to be seen. The ending was also done as good as the rest of the story would permit, but overall it was one of the best conclusions I have seen in a while, while still feeling like a great starting point for the second season.\\n\\n\r\nOur main characters are Aladdin, Alibaba and a bit later on they are joined by Morgiana. Alibaba is our generic main character, he is everything one expects of a hero in a shounen anime. Even so he gets some character development, and his backstory is deeply explored, which is laudable. Next up we have Aladdin, who is this little kid with some serious magical powers, and the ability to summon a giant jinn named Ugo to fight for him. Other than his powers he usually acts like a normal careless kid, but at times he becomes a sort of voice of reason in the group. The best character in the show has to be Morgiana, a former slave saved by our dynamic duo, to form a tenacious trio. She gets her fair share of development as she faces the demons left over from the years she spent enslaved. She is also a fearsome fighter and proves to be an invaluable member of the group. Throughout the series, several side characters are introduced, and they are almost always great additions to the story. The antagonists in the show are plentiful and fleshed out really well, but unfortunately they never seem like much of a threat.\\n\\n\r\nThe main attraction of the anime has to be the animation, it is positively amazing. The colour palette just pops out, but unlike anime like No Game, No Life it isn't overly aggressive. The scenery is exceptional as well, the world really looks like it jumped out of the 1001 Night, with the beautiful desert landscapes and the arabic architecture. The character are also done unbelievably well, the movement is smooth and the facial expressions flawless. Here I have to point out Morgiana, who has to be one of the best drawn female characters I have seen in a while. We do have a bit of fan-service here and there, but it is never overbearing, and does not distract from the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was in my opinion at list mildly disappointing, both the openings and endings were mediocre at best, and won\u2019t find their way into my iTunes library anytime soon. The rest of the soundtrack was adequate, but at no point rising to more than decent. Lastly I would like to touch upon the voice acing, as it was the first time I was bothered by the Japanese pronunciation of non Japanese names so much, that I actually started watching the dub. Would it be really so hard for them to find character names that were actually pronounceable in the Japanese language?\\n\\n\r\nAll in all the anime was an enjoying watch, but not much more than that. The pacing and the art were great, but unfortunately that alone can not pull the anime out of mediocrity, and so I give it a low 7. I am unable to wholeheartedly recommend it everyone, but if you are looking some light anime to watch, and are not bothered by predictability, this might be the right anime for you. \\n\r\nI always appreciate some feedback as so my future reviews can be even better, also if you enjoyed this review feel free to check out my other reviews.",

            "content": "Magi is a well orchestrated shounen anime with a gripping fantasy world that really sucks you in. After taking various settings and characters from the 1000 and 1 Arabian Nights stories, and combining in with a rich fantasy world has created a setting that is unique and full of detail detail that feels real. The story of Magi set within this world is rich with character development and fantastic storey arcs that start with idea of the main characters exploring, and conquering a Labyrinth a mystical tower that holds riches and legendary djinn, which is what Aladdin and Alibaba set out to after the firstfew episodes, but what follows after is a roller-coaster of gripping narrative that successfully links each story arc without you knowing.\\n\\n\r\nEach arc is well crafted to advance the main characters development as well as carry different themes they posses from slavery to discrimination and finally to fate. These themes are well crafted into the story, which helps bring serious events into fruition through good character interactions and well done fights. But we must remember that this is a Shounen so the outcome of most of the fights are predictable and tend to end in the same way which can be a little annoying but doesn't ruin the experience as much, as it could have done.\\n\r\nBy the end of the series your left feeling amazed and ready for more; even though the end ends in a cliffhanger there is a second season which is a great relieve.\\n\\n\r\nAs said before each arc mainly centres around one character and usually runs through that character's back-story that caused great emotional reaction within myself thanks to, each back-story featuring dark and depressing themes; whereas other main characters are kept more as side kicks but they are still essential to the plot and help that leading character on there journey.\\n\\n\r\nBut leading from this, I would just like to say that the characters in this show are great, they are well designed having interesting appearances that are unique in one way but also bear resemblance to characters in 100 and 1 Arabian Nights, this helps create some truly fantasy looking characters. But this could also be said about the characters personalities as well with main characters Aladdin, Alibaba and Morgiana having unforgettable and unique personalities that don't feel clich\u00e9, but not only that they all get great development over the course of the series that makes you feel like they actually grow as people.\\n\r\nBut this is not kept just by the mains as supporting characters are surprisingly well done having great appearances and personalities that makes each individual feel unique and fit into their role very well, from the cool king Sinbad to the greedy, tyrannical king Abhmad and beyond, these characters are one of the main focuses of why this world truly shines.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe art used in this anime is fairly good, having a great art style that fits the show nicely and good animation which creates great fights sequences and overall character movement though the mouth animation can look a bit odd at times.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is the most prominent part of the series as it simply beautiful with each track mixing in well with every available theme and scene in the anime. The opening is great as well - well at least the first one as it captures the sense of adventure within the show while showing a great opening animation that feels the same well while the second opening didn't do as much for me although the second opening animation was still great to watch and the ending songs I only listened to once and never listened to again as they weren't exciting or fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion you should match this, Magi is a great show with amazing story, characters and soundtrack with only a one animation problems, some uninteresting ending songs and its demographic holding it back. It is a must see that is unforgettable and unique.",

            "content": "tl;dr: I find this show to be generic, cliche and tropy. The characters behave more like generic anime characters than real people, which negatively impacts the political story line. The dialog is awkward and stilted, while consistently using the crutch of explaining everything as a form of constant exposition. The themes regarding destiny/fate are confused and many of the situations are hard to swallow as believable. \r\nI recognize that this show is very popular and well liked, which is why I was originally interested in watching this show. I love 1001 Nights and the aesthetic that goes with it, so it seemed like a goodfit for me. I have actually watched this show before, when the season was first released and decided to read most of the manga (before ultimately dropping it), but my feelings on the show are... complex. I wish there were a rating for just \"setting\" as that is really the only thing I actually like about this anime. I find that the later storylines pick up some of the slack and the story DOES improve somewhat, but not within this season.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as shounen anime go, this is a fine place for any shounen fans to go. I would say that it's in league with shows like Naruto or Dragon Ball. That is, however, as far as my recommendation goes. I imagine that if I had watched this as a kid, I would have loved the anime. It has a great inspiration, the setting is interesting, and it has all those shounen gimmicks for an action/adventure show that any kid would love. If you are looking for a shounen series, this show is passable. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, I wasn't looking for a shounen series, I think I was looking for something more a long the lines of Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood in quality. I don't particularly like shounen as an adult and I don't think that this show does anything to escape the trappings of the genre. I also, fundamentally disagree with the idea that anime should continue to follow these tired and obnoxious tropes. I don't think that \"shounen\" is an excuse for cliche.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are pretty basic anime tropes that do nothing to escape that trapping. They are the same characters you have seen in a hundred anime. The show itself is cliche, predictable, tropy and it does nothing to separate itself from every other shounen. I am actually shocked that this series has such high ratings, because of just how unambitious it is. It is sterotypical anime down to its core. The dialog is awkward at best and absurd at worst. People don't talk or behave like people, they behave like parodies of anime characters. I find the dialog and writing to be embarrassing and cringy; I haven no other words to describe it. You have people CONSTANTLY explaining what they are doing, as if the audience is too stupid to figure it out. It runs into that issue where battles come to a complete stop so that the characters can narrate what they are doing, which is unnecessary and something I particularly hate. It violates the classic concept of \"show, don't tell\" every chance it gets. Possibly due to translation, but the dialog itself comes off as incredibly unnatural. Not just because they are constantly explaining what's happening, but because the show seems more interested in fulfilling shounen check boxes than it does illustrating a believable world, inspired by 1001 nights. The characters, their actions, and the way they talk are all ridiculous and in some instances, unbelievable. The villains are so petty and obvious that it's impossible to take them seriously. The heroes are just... anime heroes. \\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is passable. It's nothing special and only works because of the interesting setting that the writer put together. I love the ideas of dungeons and Magi and the Arabic aesthetic. However, I think the presence of sterotypical anime characters and ridiculous plot tropes really only drags the compelling setting down. You have these political scenarios, which sound interesting on paper, but are executed to a degree of absurdity. These nations don't behave or interact like real world nations, they behave and act like, well, anime characters. In shows like Gurren Laggan, it works, because of how wonderfully absurd and stylized the story is. In this, they try to play it too straight for it to be believable. Compare it to the political events of central in Fullmetal Alchemist or the tense political scenario of 08th MS Team. In the latter, the political situation is believable, consistent, and has a thread of realism that makes the situations feel dire and tense. In Magi, it just feels... made up. There are multiple moments in the show that just seem overly simplistic and unlikely. \\n\\n\r\nBeyond the fact that I find this show to be intensely generic, unrealistic, and cliche, Magi is also built around some ridiculous themes regarding destiny. Without spoiling anything, the end of the first season builds up this theme that I just cannot get behind. The themes of Magi are only believable within the context of the show and are not translatable to reality. That is at least, if you take the story in the first season at face value. I think that the themes become more reasonable in the second series, as more information is provided, but at the very least I would say that themes are confused. Specifically, I am referring to the show's position on the concept of fate. The theme honestly feels inconsistent, which leads to this conflicting opinion on it. There are moments in the show that almost seem to imply that \"going against fate is bad\", which is ridiculous and one reason I detest the show. But... then the actual mechanics of the concepts of fate become fleshed out and the theme begins to take a turn. But I would almost argue that the inconsistent perspective of faith has more to do with providing the good guys opportunities to be in the right, rather than any solid stance on the concept. Either way I find the themes to range from dumb at worst to confused at best. \\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, this show is just another shounen anime that doesn't do anything to evolve the genre. There are too many anime that use shounen tropes as skeleton to make something unambitious, cliche, and generic. I don't like these tropes and they hold the genre back. Just because an adventure series is aimed at young adults, doesn't mean that they have to tell the same stories and characters over and over again. There are better shows that do way more with the medium.\\n",

I figured it'd be a nice change of pace from other battle-oriented shounen. For a few episodes, I really enjoyed it! Aladdin and Alibaba are really likable protagonists, and I enjoyed the way the story began to open up the greater world.\r\nSoon though, the show introduces more political themes, as certain countries begin going to war, roping the protagonists into conflict. At this point, the show descends into typical shounen tropes. The light adventure tone of the firstfew episodes has been replaced by episode-long battles, where the protagonist always wins. By the end of this season, so many characters are thrown at you with no explanation of their backstories or reasons for existing. I even had trouble telling them apart. \\n\\n\r\nThe main antagonist by the time we get to the end of the season, which feels like a cop-out. None of the action on screen really meant anything to me. It just felt stale. I wish we could know more about the character's backstories like in One Piece, or maybe the arcs were a little shorter like in Fairy Tail, but there really wasn't anything that made me wanna watch the episode, other than hope that the series would pick up. It never did. \\n\\n\r\nLike I said, this show isn't terrible, it's just really same-y. With a unique art style and world, you figured that there would be a nice hook in place to keep you interested. After about Episode 10, the show falls back on standard shounen tropes and it really loses it's steam. There are better options out there for anime to scratch the shounen itch, but there are also worse ones. Definitely try it out if the characters or world seem interesting, but just don't expect anything breathtaking.",

All of that buildup just so Alibaba can declare \"I'm not going to hate anymore!\" then the antagonist smiles and floats up to Solomon.

            "content": "There's nothing original about a shounen series like this, but sometimes there doesn't have to be. It feels like a familiar sort of swashbuckling adventure romp (as a loose adaptation would) energized by the typical Power of Friendship that brings protagonists back together.\r\nThe presentation is warm and genuine, despite occasionally perverted moments, and mostly lacks the cynicism of edgy shonen protagonists - which is not to say the series is lacking in darker story beats. Themes of slavery, class divides and corruption/exploitation are interesting undercurrents that go hand-in-hand nicely with the characters and their stories. (Morgiana is a personal favorite)\r\nThat said, an arc consisting mostlyof politics and a critical look at government systems (only occasionally punctuated by the usual sword and sorcery) felt like a bit of a slog that might miss the mark with some of its target audience. The show is at its best when it's just the three main protagonists on their journeys, encountering the menagerie of crazy henchmen and villainous Illuminati. Said arc isn't improved by the relative lack of comic relief throughout those episodes in comparison to other episodes - the tone seems at odds with the rest of the show and drags on a bit too long.\\n\\n\r\nOverall nothing revolutionary in the anime space, but there's something to be said about a show as good-spirited as Magi. Bright and bubbly at its highs, there's not a lot that would really disappoint anyone looking into the adventure genre.\\n\\n",

By the end of this first run, I was getting tired of some things that kind of settle into the standard mold.  That said, it is still much better than the average.  Magi has many characters, but weaves them into its story in ways that do not feel cumbersome (like so many recent space opera anime...).  \r\nother good stuff:\r\nfun\r\ngenerally upbeat\r\ndoesn't always do the hero saving people without killing anyone thing.\r\nhas reasons for doing the hero saving people without killinganyone thing, which makes it not awful to watch\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nother bad stuff:\\n\r\noften spills into the realm of melodrama, includes many scenes of guys crying \\n\\n\r\ndoes the thoroughly hackneyed hero saving people (often from themselves) without killing anyone thing.

If you don't know what I am talking about, it is highly unlikely that it would do any good to explain it to you.

            "content": "This series is roughly based on one thousand and one arabian nights. Characters like Aladdin, Ali Babba and Sin Bad are main characters. It's not closely linked to, but the theme is taken from some great classic tales.The series is adapted from a Manga series, and I highly recommend reading it as well.\r\nMagi is a series that started out very promising. It's based on an ongoing weekly manga series. The story is a little truncated compared to the manga, and it's pacing is set a little too fast at times. It's quality effectively is great at times, but it does drop occasionally. Overall it's apretty good adventure anime series, but for fans of the manga it does have a made up filler ending. \\n\\n\r\nOne thing this series did really well is stayed true to the characters and their personalities. A lot of adaptations differ in too many ways, but this anime did a fairly stand up job. I loved the artwork and animation most of the time, but the comedy animation felt very lazy to me. I enjoyed the music and voice acting, and during the airing of this series I as extremely satisfied. This is one that I waited for week to week with anticipation. It does a really good job on the theme and I felt it was very enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nIt lost me at the end with the unnecessary filler ending. They could have ended it the same as the Manga's story arc did and had a much better open ended conclusion. One of my biggest complaints in most series based on Manga is that they deviate too much. If something has a big enough fan base to animate it then they should leave the story alone. Make it better if you can without changing it. I don't think they delivered in the end, but if you haven't read the manga then you won't bat an eye.\\n\\n\r\nComplaints aside, it's a great introduction to the series. I love the characters, and I enjoyed the story. I feel it's a must see if you're into action adventure anime series.",

            "content": "First of all, I have to say I am a fan of the manga which this anime was derived from. Overall I think this is a \"okie\" adaptation and I gave it a overall score of 8 out of 10. \r\nFollowing this I will give a detailed breakdown of how I feel about the adaptation compared to the manga.\r\nStory: 8\r\nStory is exactly the same as the manga, only some minor details in the scenes are edited. The story of \"Magi\" is a story of grand adventure using a paraody of the characters and the background setting from the classic \"Tales of the arabian nights\" stories.Most people would be famililar with names such as \"Aladdin and the magic lamp, Ali Baba and the forty thieves, Sinbad and the Tales of the seven seas\"\\n\\n\r\nMagic lamps, spells, flying magic carpets, djinns, deserts, bandits, adventure & danger... all the iconic objects and elements from \"Tales of the arabian nights\" make it into the story of \"Magi\". \\n\r\nMy only gripe with this anime adaptation was that the emotional parts of the story from the manga does not have the same weight as they do in the anime. It could be due the fast pacing of the anime episodes. \\n\r\nThe drama and emotional, dark, gritty background stories on each the characters was part of what made the plot of manga \"Magi\" so attractive. The characters are flawed and almost everyone has a bit of dark history, the history makes the actions of each character believable and the reader/viewer can relate and understand the motivations of each character.\\n\r\nHowever in the anime the scenes which deplict their histories seem to be rushed and this reduces the overall weight and effect of the emotional drama.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nBright colours in the anime are really well done and the characters are animated almost exactly as they were in the manga, in a bit of a childish, immature way. The colours really bring out the beauty of ancient arabian culture as if you would want to see them if you could travel back into time. \\n\r\nThe childish character animations bring out part of the comedy aspect, the anime doesn't take itself too seriously, and this gives the viewer a nostalgic feeling of adventure & discovery that they had when they were less than 10 years old.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThe voice actors for each of the characters fit the characters perfectly, except maybe for Aladdin. A voice actor with a more childish voice might have been a better match for Aladdin, but overall the current voice actor does a decent job.\\n\r\nThe opening and especially the ending song really brings out the childlike sense of adventure that is invoked when a person gets involved watching \"Magi\". \\n\r\nJust listening to the childish voices singing the chorus of the ending song, watching scenes of Aladdin and gang travelling, being wowed visiting the different cultures all across the land, gives the viewer the feeling of grand adventure, innocent wide eyed amazement at discovering new cultures and seeing new lands. This bundle of positive feelings is really a good summary of what a viewer feels when watching \"Magi\" :)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\nLike I mentioned in the story review section, the characters are well thought out. Each character has a distinct personality, flaws and elaborate backstory with a little bit of darkness splashed in. This makes the characters believable, the motivations sound, and the audience can understand, relate and connect to the characters. \\n\r\nI only wished the anime could spend a little more time and effort and add more weight to the dark backstory sections (as compared to the manga). A first time anime viewer of \"Magi\" compared to the manga reader would probably not be as invested in the characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nPretty enjoyable anime overall as it conveys the beauty and sense of adventure from the manga version of \"Magi\" very well. So far whenever a new anime episode is subbed and released each week I have been eagerly watching and anticipating how the story from the manga is going to be adapted into anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nA decent anime adaption of \"Magi\" from manga to anime. The songs, voice acting are almost a perfect fit for the characters. The anime remains very faithful to the story and filler free (thank goodness!). My only gripe is that they seem to breeze through the story at a pretty fast pace and don't spend enough time elaborating on the darker backstory sections of the characters. I would actually recommend reading the manga over watching the anime. And if a person wants to do both, read the manga first before watching the anime, enjoy!",

At the beginning of the series I found Alibaba to be a weak coward that could not handle his own fate, but as I continued to watch the show I found that I was completely wrong. In addition, I loved how the story was able to show the backstory of the characters, without it dominating the subject of most of the episodes. I felt that the art was outstanding. You could visually see the emotions of the characters, sometimes in very humorous ways. The characters were all well developed and each character played an important role inthe story. The history of each character fit well into the overall plot of the story, and no character seemed out of place. I loved this anime and recommend it to anime viewers who love magical kingdoms, excitement, humor, and bonds between the characters. I enjoy the messages spread by the main characters and the comedy mixed within the wonderful story!",

I was stuck after the first episode, the adventures feeling you get, there is much action and a good story. Couldn\u2019t ask for that much more in a lightheaded action/adventure anime, they even include the team-work for the characters to overcome different enemies. However for me the overall is just a 8 as i feel the show gets slow loses the \u201dtouch\u201d midway however they make it better thenever at the last few episodes I would also like some more explanation. However that is a personal note and they only way you can know whether you\u2019ll enjoy it or not is to watch it yourself hope you will enjoy it\u2026 I\u2019ts definitely worth a watch ^_^",

            "content": "*THIS IS ONLY A REVIEW OF THE FIRST SEASON I WILL MAKE ANOTHER REVIEW OF THE SECOND SEASON IF THE ENDING CHANGES MY FEELINGS*\r\nArt style: very crisp and clear. I thought the colorful art style matched the mood of the anime very well. I loved how they made their chibi forms. It matched the Arabic feel of the anime.\r\nStory: When I clicked on it I would have never imagined that the anime would have Aladdan characters in it. It was fun at first to try to guess what characters were who. But this is another case of an anime loosely representing something else, once you'rehalf way through you forget that this is an anime version of Aladdan. I'm not saying that this is bad, I actually like when non anime things get animefied to where you can't even tell that they're the same thing. I think the story is very well done, but for me it was easy for me to guess what happened next, so nothing really caught my attention.\\n\r\nMusic: both of the openings were actually very fitting for the anime. When I heard Sid I was very shocked, since most of the anime I've heard Sid has been serious styled anime, but I grew to think it fitted the anime very well. I thought the background music wasn't anything special to me. The parts where the Arabic style music was very loud sounded pretty cool. I wish the would've kept with that style of music.\\n\r\nCharacters: all had a pretty generic feel to them. I liked how Aladdan's character was made. It was kind of a mix between Albu and Aladdan. That was really the only thing I found really outstanding. \\n\\n\r\nThe complaint I have is that the background characters voice actors were the same as the main characters. I can understand reusing background characters, just not with the exact same voice of main. I loved seeing Todd Haberkorn playing the bad guy. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I thought the first season of this anime was okay, it didn't really move me, but wasn't horrible. I give the overall score a 8 because its better than some anime, but not the best.",

Though the general idea behind the scenario has potential, that potential is unfortunately very poorly exploited. The first four, maybe five episodes are interesting. In a way. But then the second main character, Alibaba, suddenly has a turn in ideas, decides to tag along with the very guy who killed hisfather and made him believe he was his friend just to get information out of me. He loses self confidence, lets himself be led along by half the town without resisting, becomes scared of everything... WHAT THE HELL?? Very little explanation for his motives are actually given. Perhaps the explanations for this are given later, but after holding on to the anime for the last three episodes with boredom on my face, I'm afraid I won't be finding out.\\n\\n\r\nI also tend to find the soundtrack inadequate, both in nature and in pacing. Seriously, why use classical music? I get the point of having Arabic music because it fits with the setting, but why CLASSICAL of all genres?? It completely breaks the pacing of the scenes it accompanies.",

            "content": "Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic had all of the right stuff to be great...\r\n...But it wasn't (yet!).\r\nIt might be right to say that the first season of the anime was more like a prologue than a real anime. Lots of information to relay and little story to tell.\r\nStory: the story get some bad points at the most important part of the plot, the climax. It was not well done, with lots of information dragging through 3-4 episodes (those last 2 arcs were really disappointing to me, that had high expectations for this show).\r\nArt: What can I say about the art...the budget didn't help? I mean,when they wanted to, it was an epic animation, the drawings were perfect and the art flow was very well made. But this \"perfect\" animation in some episodes had its bill payed with the killing of other episodes, that were kind of...sloppy.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I can say that the sound is the most personal opinion I have here. When talking about sound, we think about the OP and ED, but this time what got me was the background music. I always liked this Arabian Nights music and it is simply beautiful to hear it. Love it (but the OP and ED got some points off it, truly bad).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I think that here is where Magi shines. Alladin, Alibaba and Morgiana had one of the best character development of the year (and I can't wait what will happen on the next season). Adding it with Ugo, the princes and princesses all around...Everyone had the spotlight at themselves at some point.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Well, I enjoyed. Even with the animation and pace issues, I admit that I expected every single chapter anxiously, and that is only found in good animes\\n\\n\r\nOverall: If Magi had been a 1-cour show, it would be rushed, with 2-cour it was slow paced. I can say that, even though my rating was quite poor, I'm going to watch the 2nd season for sure (praying that they get some better budget for animation, so it can be even better).",

            "content": "Here comes a little refreshment for your usual and everyday animes.\r\nAbout the STORY\r\nArabian night; a rare theme and setting for an anime. It\u2019s a perfect setting for a story of magic and adventure. A story of clearing dungeons using magic and getting treasures just like in games will surely get attention of viewers. There\u2019s a nice blend of action, adventure, drama, a little bit of comedy, and even politics. It\u2019s not just all about fictional but there are no non-sense drama and politics as well. However, it has the tendency to become over the top or cheesy. Just like other stories, there are few boringmoments. \\n\\n\r\nAbout the CHARACTERS\\n\r\nThe main character is not particularly the physically strong type of protagonist but definitely strong character, personality-wise. Not to mention, he\u2019s also very adorable. For an adventure kind of story, it is given that there quite a number of different characters. And some has their individual circumstances explored in the story.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the ANIMATION and SOUNDS\\n\r\nAnimation is really nice and perfect for the setting. The graphics, fighting scenes, and effects are exciting. Even the character designs are clean and detailed. The soundtracks also reminds of desserts which is perfect for the Arabian Nights theme.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the ENJOYMENT\\n\r\nA really enjoyable series I\u2019ve seen in a long time. The setting and theme is quite refreshment for our typical daily animes. The mysterious parts are something to look forward to. That said, it\u2019s not particularly \u201cthat\u201d exciting. It\u2019s lacking a certain edge that can separate it from the others. The Arabian Night theme is sure a huge plus but still. Some of the important elements of the series are already the usual things like battle between bad and good, wars of different countries, a mysterious organization, and a protagonist who just appeared. I believe it is alright to use the typical storyline over and over again but you still have to change something to separate it from the usual. Nevertheless, it is definitely still interesting and exciting. And I am sure to wait for the sequel.\\n",

            "content": "When I had first heard about Magi, I was too overly interested and said I would watch it at a later time. But when I couldn't get the anime I wanted working, I decided to give the first episode a shot. I have been stuck ever since. This is truly an amazing anime that really sucks you in and gives wonder to the genre.\r\nStory - 9 - As much as I loved the story, there were times when I didn't quite understand what was going on. It at times seemed a little fast paced for the mind to keep up, and then there were timeswhen it seemed a little too slow for my taste. But then the story picked back up and kept me interested for quite some time. So, yes, the story has it's ups and downs, and I don't think it as all overly original, for dungeons have always been a popular topic for both animes and games recently. But it does have it's creative moments with many of the events that happen within and the abilities that reside there. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 10 - I do have to say, the art was wondrous. The scenery was always breath-taking and never looked out of place. The monster designs were interesting and different at times as well as the characters. No one person looked the same, everyone was unique in their own style. I also loved the different art styles used through-out the anime, had very intense art for important parts and then little chibis for the comedy. It all fit together rather well.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10 - The voice actors were stellar, the emotion always present in their voices and acting, you could really feel everything that the actor and character was trying to express. I have to say, without the voices that were in this, I don't think the anime could have been such a hit. They could switch from a light mood and go straight into a darker situation within seconds of the anime. And the music fit well with the focus of the anime, the opening and endings always catchy but symbolic to the anime. The background music has a certain feel to it that often was able to explain many situations that occurred and the sound effects were spot on. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10 - Like every anime, there were your good characters and your bad characters, yes, even I found some characters that I rather disliked. I could never find myself to like Judal, he just didn't seem right to me to begin with, I personally always found him a little off. But one thing about him, is that I never really get to know much about him. Even though I think his personality was made for use to dislike him, we can help but wonder about who exactly he is. The same can be said about many other characters that appear in this, not everything about them is revealed in this season, which leads more to be said in the next one. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9 - Like I said, when I first started watching, I couldn't bring myself to stop. But there were times when I found myself bored and like I was about to fall asleep. Thankfully, these moments were few and far between. Mostly through my experience watching it, I was sucked and always eager to watch the next episode. There was a time when I was around episode 15 and such, and I had to retire for the night, but I did not want to go to sleep. Course, I forced myself to stop and get some rest but the minute I woke up, I went straight back to watching it. The anime is rather addicting and hard to put done at times, but I guess that's what makes a good anime, in a sense.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10 - I thoroughly enjoyed my time spent on watching the anime. The only down point I see to this is that I must now await the second season. Thankfully, I've started this anime late in the game and have little time to wait for the second installment that is said to be released in October of this year. I eagerly await this new season and look forward to the tales it is likely to unfold for us. I highly recommend this anime.",

            "content": "Magi is an anime inspired by arabian night tales, it starts out all and well with an interesting plot line and intriguing deep characters. The story follows as Alibaba and Aladdin meet and form a strong bond together over the course of the series. However, towards the middle of the series the plot becomes hazy and you're not sure where things are going and suddenly the show ends.\r\nThe series had a huge potential to explore more of the characters and their development, however as watchers we end up getting introduced to potentially important characters towards the last 3 episodes. Which is quite shameful in considerationto what the series could offer for more entertainment. 25 episodes are just simply not enough even if there is an upcoming sequel the rushed events that happened within the actual show leave you hanging, wondering about the details and also bitter feelings towards the shortness and rushed events of the show. The show does however explore the arabian 101 theme differently and gives it a new twist that captured me as a watcher.\\n\\n\r\nStory wise the show's decent but it wasn't executed correctly (in the anime at the very least), personally I would have preferred to see more of the characters and for the author to just simply focus on one potential goal for the show instead of many events happening and no decent end result.\\n\\n\r\nThe art for the show is alright. Nothing special or outstanding about it to make it stand out. The sound also is medicore at best. There weren't any decent tracks that catch the watchers interest. However the soundtrack was at least matching with the events so it receives good points for that. The play with arabian elements in the tracks is also executed decently albeit their unoriginality.\\n\\n\r\nThe overall enjoyment of the show is alright considering the fact that the arabian 101 theme has already been overused. Kudos to the author however for giving it a new twist and creating intriguing characters at the very least. I'm sure the events are more outstanding and more detailed in the manga so yes the anime at least opens that one door that makes you want to at least see these events by reading. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I'd say the show is fairly watchable. It held my interest at least till the very end.",

            "content": "Yes, I found the story outstanding. It was generally told from 2 characters' point of view, and was extremely distinguishable. You really can't get confused by it. Episodes flowed smoothly, with the exception of the last few in which the plot seems a bit rushed. One of the main reasons I enjoyed this was because it was completely original. Even with these familiar names, it's of no relevance to where you may have previously seen them. Their concept of magic is like one I've never seen, and I've seen many stories involving such things. The plot kept me guessing, and new things were discovered atevery turn, but never to the point where it got too complex. Even the politics were explained well enough so you can completely understand it, but not overdone as to get boring. In other words, it's an easy to understand series. The pacing was just right for the plot, quick as it should be for a story of adventurous nature. However, as I said above, the last few seemed a bit rushed. But if one doesn't think too hard (or read the manga beforehand, as I have) I believe they won't notice anything. The adventure was displayed very well, with constant conflict and action. The slight touch of humor lightened the mood at the right moments, and though a few seemed forced, I still found them amusing. Their methods of fighting were quite varied, so it may be confusing, but the techniques of the main characters were straightforward enough. The ending wasn't quite satisfying. Not to say it's very good, because it is, but it left a few mysteries open that clearly need to be resolved in the next season. (Something I look forward greatly to.) Overall, the story was very nearly perfect.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this was unique as well. All the characters have this chibi-ish appearance to them, but varied enough so the changes in their moods are displayed quite clearly. Also, every character was distinguishable, which makes any story that much easier to follow, and their appearances suit their personalities very well. The background art was beautiful, and the animation stunning. Extremely smooth, with distinguishable colors and slight, dramatic pauses and speeding, but never too dramatic. It made the action seem more realistic. The art never changed throughout the story, which is to be expected since it's one of the shorter series. I find it very memorable and enjoyable to see, and I would re-watch this series any time just to see it again.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was fantastic, with upbeat OPs and EDs that get you in the mood to watch that episode and the next. I especially loved the 1st OP and the second ED, though all of them were amazing. Appropriate soundtracks at appropriate times, and realistic sounds that make it seem as if you were there. I find it exceptional on how much detail they put into the sound, and the clarity of it was amazing. The voices were perfect, matching the character's expressions to the point of flawlessness. I would gladly listen to the OST anytime; just hearing the series is a joy.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were well rounded, nearly all of them indicating some sort of hard past, and individual flaws and strengths, which were clearly displayed. I can't say I can relate to the characters as I've never been in any of their situations, but I imagine I would feel something similar if I were. Some were fleshed out more than others, and some very little, but those were minor characters that had very little appearance in the show. Enough of their personality was showed for them to successfully play their roles, with just a little extra to make them memorable. The show had no narration, but that suited the series just fine. I believe I will remember nearly of these characters, and I particularly liked the main three. None I disliked, as even the enemies were well rounded. Really, the characters personality wise were quite realistic.\\n\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed this series, and I believe others will as well. It's fun, interesting, and a thrill to watch. The characters did react to their situations in a realistic way, making it that much more easy to get in to. I think even non-anime/manga lovers would enjoy this. And, as I said before, I would re-watch the entire show at anytime. I really just loved it. It's a memorable one, and I think I won't forget it anytime soon.\\n\\n",

He's cheeky, but clever and knows what he wants and needs to do, although he's still discovering who he is as a person.\r\nAladdin meets Alibaba by immediately, though unintentionally causing trouble for him.

One of the things Aladdin strives for is tomake friends, so he's very happy when his offer is accepted.\\n\\n\r\nYou get to see them all grow up, become stronger mentally and psychically and get closer as friends. Aladdin, Alibaba and Morgiana are a great trio, they've very individual in themselves, yet fit together really well. They have their own hopes and dreams but stick together as much as possible, it shows true friendship and adds to the charm of the series.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a story of adventure, friends, battles, magic and attaining your goals. Each person is prominent, there's not just one main story. Each of them weave in and out of each other to compliment the stories of others. \\n\r\nIt's mostly happy and fun, but it's not without it's emotional parts.\\n\r\nThe plot is different, the story is great and overall it's a very enjoyable series.

Then 'The Labyrinth of Magic' and lastly 'The Kingdom of Magic'. \r\nThe story is great but the way that they skip some of Sinbad's adventures kind of ruins the progression of the show from the beginning towards the end. But ignoring that. The show shows the difference of people s thought process. If someone'slife was bad because of the different type of people around, then their thought process would be that they hate that certain type of people and would discriminate among them. This then divides the world and creates chaos and misery. But if people wouldn't seek for more power and create more hatred, then the world would be better. But at the same time, evil will always be among the world whether you like it or not.    \\n\\n\r\nBut overall, this show got me hooked and I couldn't stop watching it. So I suggest that you try it out if you haven't already. :)",

And a very rich and well built universe, sensational and choreographed fights with muto exciting scenes, although the animation is not very good I liked it a lot, my favorite character I am in doubt between alibaba and sinbad, two user of metal fucking receptacle .a soundtrack and optimum and really gives a more impact on the specific scenes, the animation sinned a little at certain times (EX: alibaba and alladin vs djin black and judar) if it had a deserved animation would have been even more fuck the anime, the scenes focused on the morgiana are always fuck, she with her overwhelming strength has no one to beat head on. I think that's it, I recommend it too much, watch it, you will not regret it",

Time is valuable and if I feel miserable watching an anime this slow so I have to move on. I gave Magi 6 episodes and it wasn't terrible. It just wasn't interesting or inspiring. The storyline seemed fair but it was just too slow for me. The action is so scarce and every episode felt more like some friendship lesson. It had too much of a PG vibe and instead of delivering divine punishment to these worthless spoiled slaversthat pop up, their punishment was soft. That quickly degraded the atmosphere of this story for me. Maybe it gets way better, but 6 episodes is taking too long. The art is also fair. There isn't a lot of detail or any unique sort of style. It's very basic and unimpressive. There are many anime that obliterate this one in terms of art design. The soundtrack was also boring. The music wasn't bad but it isn't great either. Nothing special to hum to or get inspired by. What pulled the soundtrack score up for me though was that it at least matched its eastern atmosphere. The characters also had a very basic feel. They were too quiet and lacked defining personalities. The only character who stood out to me was Aladdin because his innocent attitude felt pure and just. All in all, Magi is just too slow to search for its jewels. It's better to watch an anime that does its job the entire time.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n-Unique story and atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Uninspirational soundtrack.\\n\r\n-Mediocre art design.\\n\r\n-Extremely slow/boring story progression.\\n\r\n-A bit too \"Disney\"/PG feeling.\\n\r\n-A lack of justice delivered to villains.",

            "content": "Note: This will be a review of both seasons.\r\nOverview:\r\nI'm assuming everyone's heard about \"One Thousand and One Nights\" at some point in their lives, right? You know, the collection of Arabian folk tales following the adventures of Aladdin, Alibaba, Sinbad and many other figures and their various adventures and searches for treasure. \"Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic\" and its sequel \"The Kingdom of Magic\" is a shounen fantasy anime heavily influenced by these very stories, yet still manages to emerge as a fresh and unique story in its own right. How does it manage this, I hear you ask? Well, you're about to find out.\r\nStory& World (8.5/10):\\n\r\nThe story is quite complex, which makes it difficult to describe concisely, but I'm going to try anyway. Basically, it follows Aladdin, a ten-year-old boy and traveller who lives in an alternate recreation of the ancient Old World, where all living beings possess an essence known as Rukh, which can only be seen by incredibly powerful magicians known as Magi, one of whom, as fate would have it, is Aladdin. There are also several magic castles known as Dungeons and each of them is the lair of a powerful magic being called a Djinn. Individuals that manage to overcome the trials of a Dungeon and earn the allegiance of its Djinn become known as Dungeon Capturers, gaining the ability to use its powers infused in a personal item of theirs known as a Metal Vessel as well all the treasure that lies within the Dungeon. In the first episode alone, we're introduced to not only Aladdin, but a teenage boy named Alibaba and a slave girl called Morgiana, the latter of whom is part of a mysterious and super-strong warrior tribe known as the Fanalis. These two quickly become not only Aladdin's travelling companions, but also his closest friends.\\n\\n\r\nBut, to be honest, I've barely scratched the surface, as things just get more and more complicated as time goes on, which is no bad thing, really. As far as anime settings go, this one is incredibly unique, as no other anime I know is set in Arabian lands and the world-building is brilliant. The dungeons are quite interesting and no two look even remotely the same. And, unlike almost every treasure-hunting story I know, the heroes actually manage to walk away with some treasure and relics instead of having to sacrifice them for a greater good. How about that?\\n\\n\r\nThe series starts off as a rather light-hearted action-comedy adventure, but things start to get a lot darker and more serious in the Magnostadt arc, which takes up the entire final quarter of the series and deals heavily with dark themes like racism and poverty. All of this being said, the story is not without its problems. Some of the settings are very underused since we see little of them, which is always a risk when creating such a vast world. The story can also feel very dragged out at times, with many scenes going on for much longer than they should. Considering the series adapts about 4 or 5 chapters per episode, I can only imagine how slow the pacing of the manga is. The second season also ends on a huge cliffhanger, which will leave people begging for a third season. That being said, these problems are pretty small, and overall the story is one of the highlights of the series.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation (8/10):\\n\r\nThe art is, for a lack of a better word, generic. It doesn't look awful, but it doesn't look amazing either. The character designs are rather simple and the environments look just like those of many other anime. There's also a lot of deranged animation in the series, which I have never been a fan of as I've seen several anime that do comedy just fine without it. There are some really good effects, such as the Rukh and the magic effects, but overall the visuals don't do anything that we haven't seen a hundred times.\\n\\n\r\nSound & Dialogue (8.5/10):\\n\r\nThe soundtrack isn't anything to write home about, but it's well-done and fits the series very well. Some of the opening and ending themes are great as well, most notably \"Hikari\" and \"Eden\". The voice acting is excellent, with special mentions going to Erica Mendez as Aladdin (the role that got her noticed) and Cristina Vee as Morgiana, though I don't think I found a single voice in the series that I didn't like. The dialogue is quite plain, for the most part, but that means that the memorable lines stand out all the more.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8.5/10):\\n\r\nThe characters are another one of this series's strengths. There's an awful lot of them so it would take forever to go through them all, so for now I'll focus on the main ones. Aladdin is considerably younger than a standard shonen protagonist and that always has its risks, since young boys have a reputation for being brats. Thankfully, I can say that Aladdin is nothing like that. He's actually very wise and mature for his age, which is largely the result of him being a Magi, which grants him access to Solomon's Wisdom. He's also surprisingly perverted and manly for his age, having a tendency to bury his face into womans' breasts, which leads to some downright hilarious moments. He starts off very naive, but after lots of experience and training in magic, he grows into a very wise and powerful magician with a strong moral compass.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, if I were to pick a favourite character in the series, it would have to be Morgiana, the slave girl who Aladdin and Alibaba rescue at the beginning from Jamil, a two-bit slaver and the first villain of the series. She is a Fanalis, a very powerful and clearly not-human warrior tribe with legs and feet stronger than any kind of footwear, so needless to say, she is a total badass. She feels indebted to Aladdin and Alibaba for saving her and so is determined to repay that debt. Despite her stoic nature, she soon proves herself to be just as kind as Aladdin, being unable to turn her back on anyone in danger. Having been a slave for pretty much her whole life, the concept of being able to do whatever she wants is pretty much completely alien to her, and so part of her character development involves learning the meaning of freedom, which is very interesting to watch. Unfortunately, her screentime is quite limited during the second half of the second season, which admittedly takes away from an otherwise fantastic arc.\\n\\n\r\nLast up, we have Alibaba, a teenage boy who becomes Aladdin's best friend and is later revealed to be the adopted son of a prince. Initially, he suffers from very low self-confidence due to the tragic loss of his father at a young age and a falling-out with his best friend Cassim, a gang leader whom he comes into conflict with early in the series. I was able to relate to him quite strongly, since I have a lot of insecurities myself. He and Aladdin have quite a bit in common, since Alibaba is also very mature for his age (what he went through will do that to you) and the two often go out \"babe-hunting\". Overall, though, I found him to be the least compelling of the three.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters are numerous, with various people from several different nations. Notable examples include Sinbad, an extremely powerful king and the capturer of seven (yes, seven) dungeons, Hakuryuu, a prince from a foreign land who bears an uncanny resemblance to Prince Zuko from \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\", and Judar, another Magi who can basically be summed up as an evil Aladdin. The reason for the not-so-glowing score is that I felt there were a lot of characters who could have used more screen-time, particularly Hakuei, Hakuryuu's older sister who I found to be a lot more likable than her brother, though anymore would be a spoiler.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8.5/10):\\n\r\nPacing issues notwithstanding, \"Magi\" manages to be a very enjoyable series, with plenty of action and comedy to keep you engaged throughout the 50 episodes. Even when it descends into darker territory in the Magnostadt arc, it never feels heavy-handed since the dark elements are handled very meaningfully, instead of feeling overdone like so many other anime. There were some moments when I felt like yawning, but they were few and far between.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n\"Magi\" is a series I can definitely say I enjoyed watching, and a brilliant reimagining of old tales. It's hard not to put it in the same boat as \"Hunter X Hunter\" or \"Fairy Tail\", but to dismiss it just because of that would be a mistake. The story is deep and interesting, the world is vast and the characters are fantastic. Even if you aren't a particularly big fan of shounens, this is an anime worth seeing.\\n\\n\r\nScore:\\n\r\n8.5+8+8.5+8.5+8.5=42/50=8.4/10",

            "content": "I recently finished the amazing anime that is 'Magi: Labyrinth of Magic'. This anime is really popular. (I mean...there are Aladdin and Alibaba plushies out there!) I've heard about it before (Many times over.) But I never really got into it. (I went through a 'No mainstream ANYTHING' phase. Yeah, that was not fun...)\r\nSo, basically, this summer is 'Wren catches up with popular animes'. Derp. ~(._.)~\r\nBut, gosh, this is an amazing anime. It's so amazing. I can't stop gushing about it. (Well...I'll stop as soon as I start 'Your Lie in April'. Then ALL my Tweets will be GIFs of me crying. Can't wait forthat, am I right?)\\n\r\nEven though I wasn't a huge fan at first. (Truth.)\\n\\n\r\nThis anime blew me away. (Which is another way to say 'I LOVE MAGI' subtly. Subtle.) You're probably wondering why. I mean, that's what this review is for! And you're obviously reading this review. Sooo. You know.\\n\\n\\n\r\n1) I actually felt something. \\n\r\nIn my cold, stone heart, I felt something. This anime seems like a lighthearted shounen until it slams you in the gut and screams \"NO\" really loudly. And flips the table. And steals your drink. (This anime is very cruel at times.)\\n\\n\r\nI had so many feels while watching this. Okay...I'll admit the first half or so with the 'Morgiana and Alibaba and Aladdin are separated. Oh no!' stuff, I got bored. Very so. But I persevered! That's when I hit the jackpot. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime turns into a ball of deadly kill-your-feels scenes with a little dash of tears. Okay...more like a lot of tears. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n(I'm going to direct you to my analysis of episode 17. Ehem. Episode 17 Crying and laughing at the same time is a sign of madness...I meant an amazing anime. Hahahaha...ha.)\\n\r\nMy emotions were constantly on a rollercoaster once this anime started to pick up. This really happened with the Balbadd episodes. And, man, was that a good arc... \\n\r\nBut really. The emotions behind Alibaba's decisions and his rough past were really moving. And then the whole light and dark thing in the Zagan/the Organization arc? WOW. That was gorgeous. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThere were also many scenes that made you root for the underdogs. All the fight scenes for example. You cheered for Alibaba and Aladdin and Morgiana. I might have actually shouted loudly...once...or twice...or thrice... Yeah, this anime got me really riled up. (Not to mention all the times I yelled 'Democracy!')\\n\\n\r\nSo, yes, this anime will make you cry. And scream. And cheer. But it's great because of it.\\n\\n\\n\r\n2) The power of light is tainted with lies and deceit but ultimately gets through it all.\\n\r\nYes, this is a typical shounen with the light versus dark theme. But this anime does it better than I've seen before. The rukh symbolizes the light and dark (As does the Sindria arc's growing purple-ish bruise-ish thing.) \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe fight between light and dark is fantastic, and it starts when Judal is introduced really. (Which is really early on.) The Sindria arc focuses more on the dark and light, but the Balbadd arc touches upon it (With Kassim. You can hear my wailing now.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nI want to talk about the Organization instead. I talked about Kassim in my episode analysis. (Another shameless plug.) \\n\r\nThis is a group of bad guys. As typical of a shounen anime. But they infuse themselves with 'depravity'. In case you need to know the definition, I've pasted it below:\\n\\n\\n\r\n\"Depravity: noun\\n\r\nmoral corruption; wickedness.\"\\n\\n\r\nThanks, Google.\\n\r\nThis is really interesting. The Organization has good intentions. (They want to avoid something...that seems unavoidable. Yup, no spoilers!) And they just chose the wrong way to do it. Then they try to bring everyone else to the dark side (Which I am a member of. I have fun here. We have cookies. And Darth Vader. And Victor Vale. WOOT WOOT.) \\n\r\nBut while the Organization is very stereotypical, the approach is different. This is focused on depravity and infecting people with darkness. Which is very interesting. Most 'organizations' just want to destroy everything. But this one doesn't. Hm. Interesting, no?\\n\\n\r\n3) Alibaba isn't your stereotypical hero. \\n\r\nHe debates between light and dark. He falters. \\n\r\nI would say a spoiler here...but I won't. You're welcome. But I'll SHOW a spoiler instead! -evil laughter-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nConstantly, he's teased by the dark side. But he has friendship and hope. And this brings out the best in him. He doesn't succumb to darkness (Or depravity as in this anime.) He fights through it. And that's amazing. He's not this insane hero of the light. He's a hero of the gray. \\n\r\nAnd that makes him real. Not every real life hero has the most amazing scruples. They might fall. Maybe a little smoke or a little drink. Or, in Alibaba's case, a little DESTRUCTION OF AN ENTIRE KINGDOM. You know, small stuff. But they bounce back. And so did Alibaba. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nI admire him. That's for sure.\\n\\n\r\n4) Aladdin and Alibaba are FRIENDSHIP GOALS.\\n\r\nThe two of them are so close. They barely know each other in the beginning, but, by the end, they're best friends forever and ever and ever. They go through so much together. And they grow a connection because of it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnd, the thing is, Aladdin is Alibaba's light. He saves Alibaba many times. Sure, this gets a bit awkward if Aladdin was, say, Alibaba's love interesting, but this anime pulls the friendship card. And this works really well. \\n\r\nYou get invested in their friendship. And you just want them to be together. Forever. \\n\\n\r\nAnd last, but not least, the best reason of all.\\n\\n\\n\r\n5) Cute boys.\\n\r\nYes, this is petty, I know. But still! These boys were very attractive. And that's a nice touch for a viewer. And I will now rate them on their level of attractiveness. The results are surprising.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNumbah One: Ugo\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nHe's blue and cute. And really helpful. The first glimpse of him is deceiving, but his face is extremely attractive.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNumbah Two: Hakuryuu\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nI mean...brooding, distant prince is attractive. Plus, that scar, though. It reminds me of Zuko from 'Avatar: The Last Airbender'.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNumbah Three: Alibaba\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nAlibaba is awesome. He's cool even without his childish, chubby face. But the face tops things off.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNumbah Four: Sinbad\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nYou're probably wondering why he isn't higher on this list. It's because UGO IS LIFE. Sinbad isn't that bad. He's really ripped, though. But you know...I like Romano and all. So.",

            "content": "Alright.. let me get this straight. I was expecting the anime to be one of those usual Adventure/Fantasy genres wherein the plot just gets repetitive and the characters have a childish trait. Though one of the main characters is a child, he may not be what you expect him to be. Surely the first time you look at him he may look like one of those stubborn kids in anime that don't have any development at all but no. He is a character that does what he wants and would know what he wants to know. The story is actually really interesting. Unlike the typicalfantasy anime you would know, this one has a different setting. If you're interested in Middle Eastern mythology and all that stuff, this anime would be very interesting for you. The names of the characters are based on that type of culture. Overall, this anime might not hit the spots because there's a next season after this one! I enjoyed this series and maybe if you watch it, you will end up wanting more.",

They each have secrets that are slowly revealed throughout the show. \r\nMy problems with this anime were the main character,Alibaba tended to whine a lot but he did have probable cause to do so and how it ended. I won't tell you everything except it ended with new characters. My first thought was \"they better havea season two or i will tell everyone this is a bad anime. \"  2 seconds later Looked it up and found out there will be a second season.\\n\r\nOther than not going into full character description, this was a really great anime. There was hardly any filler episodes and the opening and ending themes are really great and catchy. The animation was fast paced and flowed great. I think you will like this anime because i know i did.",

            "content": "MAGI: THE LABYRINTH OF MAGIC: Incredible world building, poor storytelling\r\nI saw a lot of potential as early as the first episode because the author did a good job on world building. The Magi world is just so huge that there is a lot of room for the story to branch out -- and it did branch out. It talked about the mysterious powers of djinns and magic in general; about political warfare that led to slavery, poverty, and death; about the rising Kou Empire and its diplomatic attempts to rise further into power; about the mysterious organization that wants to plunge the world into darkness.All of these are tackled in a mere twenty-five episodes -- and that\u2019s not a good thing.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s the main problem I have with the series. Everything is so fast-paced that it spoils the important moments. There\u2019s not enough time to raise the tension, so every conflict feels to be resolved prematurely. The story is just too broad to be expanded in such a short period of time. And, I must add, that the story has been somewhat spoiled because of this.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters, I must admit that I find them to be very well designed. Each character has its own unique aura and personality. However, the abruptness of the story is so problematic that it even fails to expand these characters\u2019 depths well -- so most of them seem flat despite being uniquely designed. Aside from that, one of the main characters, Alibaba, has actions that are really not justifiable. His emotional tendencies are not established well, so they appear to be executed just to move the story further.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the redeeming factor of this series is really the imaginative world it has established. It is just so interesting that, despite the storytelling being awkward, I still continued watching, for I wanted to explore the incredible world before me. What makes it even more interesting is the fact that there are so many questions left unanswered in the season finale. It keeps me guessing. And it is further proof that the author did a good job in creating the fictional world. So, despite its flaws, Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic is still a watchable series. It already has the raw material to be a great anime. The only thing that needs some improvement is the storytelling. \\n",

            "content": "Ok lets start my review of magi so far.\r\n-First off need a reason to make this review so here's three.\r\n1. I personally enjoyed magi a lot.\r\n2. Most of the people here like onepiece, naruto, fairytail, or FMA. I can assure you Magi takes a lot of the good traits from those series.\r\n3. Middle eastern setting. You will not see very many if any anime touch this, and this anime touches it beautifully. From the close\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\r\nOk lets start off with Season 1.(why it's awesome and why you probably didn't know that).\r\nWhy it's awesome:\r\n-Intro-Now season 1 starts off with the three protagonist(Alladin, Alilbaba and Morgiana) all meetingup and going into the labyrinth. Sound boring yet? Well Morgiana is a slave, alladin has a thief, and Alladin is magician, all of them going into what is basically a dungeon to get the legendary weapon and obtain wealth. However it's also noted that they aren't allied in the least.\\n\r\n-Later-So that's all good and well, but overall still sounds kind of boring. I mean going into a giant tower for loot isn't exactly interesting even if you put a lot of work into it...right?\\n\r\nYup! Good thing the rest of the series moves on from that! The scope keeps getting bigger and bigger as the series goes on, right now they are having country sized wars and it's rather....amazing to say the least.(honestly i think berserk was really the only other series that did this).\\n\r\n-Characters-\\n\r\nMe personally, I find two characters that are just amazing. Sinbad(yes from the classic tales revamped) and Morgiana(the female protagonist).\\n\r\n1.Because Sinbad is a beast, an oddity, and well just godlike in the show. He's also not black and white.(as you will find most people are not.)\\n\r\n2.Morgiana is just compelling. She steals the spotlight every episode and never fails to dissapoint. Her battles are more interesting, her character more developed, and her goal more unique. It's something that really just baffles me how well this character is done.\\n\\n\r\nWhy you didn't hear about it:\\n\r\n-Magi is one of those series that really doesn't make it's audience clear. It's real audience is the FMA audience, but from the pictures you'd guess the FairyTail/OnePiece crowd was the intended target. It's a lot deeper and mature than it looks like on the surface, and goes into themes that really very very few anime/manga delve into, almost none of them shonen.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow lets talk about the two things I think are most entertaining about the show: Combat and Comedy.\\n\\n\r\nThe combat is kind of unique now.Again, very similar to FMA style with a shitload of magic being thrown everywhere but reasonably so. Also, it's life-threatening. People die, they get injured critically in battle, and a lot of shit happens on the bigger fights. If you like magic or the manipulation of elements, this show is definitely for you. However there are some melee battles, just not as good imo.\\n\r\n+YES THERE IS A LOT OF BLOOD+(this series really isn't your average shonen action).",

His destiny is intertwined with Alibaba and they plan to go on amazing adventures.\r\nThis series involves magic and historical legends from Arabia. The setting does not correspond with our world because some of the characters existed in different time periods.\r\nThe story starts with introductions and makes us believes it\u2019s more of an adventure anime. But as the series progresses, the plot involves more of the characters\u2019 history and how their past affects their beliefs and decisions.\r\nArt and animation does not seem serious and is even childlike at times. By childlike, I meantthat they will draw the characters as silly shapes. But then there are also violent scenes such as stabbings. This doesn\u2019t seem to fit well with the art direction.\\n\\n\r\nEach story arc receives more and more characters. It\u2019s hard to follow who they are and why they are fighting or helping our protagonists. I guess the reason for so many spontaneous characters is to give a feeling of large adventures and battles, but that makes it difficult to follow the intimacy of their fights.\\n",

In fact, you will pretty much overlook the setting fairly quick once you get into it.  \\n\\n\r\nThe best part is the unpredicatbility that rolls in with the story, and the adventureous nature of it.\\n\\n\r\nThe downside is that sometimes you just want the fighting to get on with it.  in fact, i would have preferred a little slower pace which is rare for me.  but well worth checking out, its definitely a hidden gem as far as im concerned",

            "content": "First Impressions:\r\nMagi has potential. Other subject matters have been woven into the plot, but simply speaking, Magi is a re-wrapping of the typical shounen action genre. The fresh Arabian setting is an enjoyable reprieve from the sea of sameness.\r\nThe early episodes give an impression that this might become an adventure/dungeon crawler type, but half way dives into the kingdom/rebellion zone. Being a fan of the latter, I was glad. Unfortunately the writing is still immature for the subject matter and doesn't completely meet the need. Episode 10's action is abruptly brought to and end by the timely arrival of an anime trope character, characters thatonly until then had 1 or 2 shots in the background from forth to spill all the beans, and Alibaba's reluctant hero nature in 12 leaves much to be desired.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is good; OP/END are catchy and don't prompt me to skip them immediately and the BGM makes good use of eastern instruments that chime in every now and then. Animation and art are crisp and does the job.\\n\\n\r\nMagi has potential. There is much here to like and possible love. Twelve episodes isn't enough to judge how this anime will become in the future. A couple missteps have left me wanting, but I'm hopeful that Magi will become something I can get excited about.\\n\\n\r\nA tentative 7.",

Some of the story elements (like those dungeon towers) should have been given more focus and others (like the dragging stale political drama arc) less. \r\nThis show is afflicted by the same elements that haunt all other generic shows: theheroic MC's speech which changes the hearts of the antagonists, yelling random words to form magic, yelling louder to gain more power, etc. No coherent or consistent rules in the world leads to no \"danger\" for the characters.

            "content": "The story is very great, but it has been done before.  It's basically a fantasy story about Aladdin and Ali Baba.  Though I have to give it an 8 for putting an interesting spin on it, but I can't give it anything higher.\r\nThe art and sound both get a 10 because they did both very well.  I love how they drew each character and even paid attention to the details as best as they could.  I like how the characters don't all look like the same people with a different hairstyle, and that really impresses me.  The music was phenomenaland fit the mood perfectly.  Not only did it fit the mood, but I even go on YouTube and listen to the soundtrack from time to time.  \\n\\n\r\nThe characters get a 7.  I do appreciate that they were diverse and had many different goals and personalities for the most part.  They went on different quests and gained different knowledge.  Though I have to talk about flaws.  \\n\r\n- Aladdin for the most part is likable, though he can be an annoying perverted pest at times.  I really hate the trope of perverted boy who wants grown women.  It's annoying at best and disturbing at worst.\\n\r\n- Ali Baba for the most part doesn't bother me aside from the occasional annoyance.\\n\r\n- Morgiana:  I don't hate her personality, more like what she represents.  It's obvious that she's African and supposed to be black, so her pale skin offends me.  I don't want to project that on her character, but it's a glaring flaw that stares at me every time she comes on screen, especially when she talks about her home town with the SAHARA.  I also don't like how she pretty much only likes Ali Baba for treating her decently, and how her later goal becomes to serve him.  Considering that she's supposed to be black and that she was a slave, that really has some unfortunate implications.\\n\r\n- Sinbad: he's arrogant and manipulative.  Though I like him for the most part.  He's good looking (what can I say, I'm shallow), and I know that I would personally manipulate someone who had a crush on me if given the opportunity to be honest.\\n\r\n- The girl that likes Sinbad is just plain sad.  She is literally lovesick and it becomes disturbing.  I didn't like Sinbad at first for his manipulation, but at some point I realized that I would do the same if some random guy worshiped the ground I walked on.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the character flaws, they were overall enjoyable to watch.  I love the cool new characters that came in and had different personalities and different looks.  They also added something new to the world, which is why I had to give it a good score for characters, despite the flaws.  The characters made the enjoyment get a 9, because the characters and plot in general were a joy to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this Anime gets a 9.  It's a great anime that I recommend along with the sequel (which has been factored in as well.",

I liked the story as it didn\u00b4t follow the all too predictable usual pattern. That is in the beginning, afterward that point more or less just got lost. I also really love the ost during the fighting scenes just as much as i disliked most of the other soundtracks. Also i can\u00b4t say that i dislike the characters but in fact i am disappointed in the missing character development on a psychicological as well as a physical lvl. Being a supernatural power anime kind of thing iwas expecting some badass battles but it just always ends up being a tag team kind of thing. So for those who are looking for one on one monster fights it might be the wrong choice. Though it\u00b4s still a good anime but just not what i was looking for.",

            "content": "I've always enjoyed the Arabian Nights theme/mythology, so I was actually a little surprised that I'd never even heard of this anime until I randomly spotted it while browsing Netflix. It's a fun show, that touches on some interesting themes while also falling into familiar shounen territory.\r\nStory - 7/10:\r\nI found the story to be a little hit or miss. There were a couple arcs that were really enjoyable, and some that stagnated a bit. The story starts off interestingly enough, with a young Aladdin eating melons in the back of Ali Baba's cart. It sets off a bit of an odd couple partnership, but itworks very nicely. \\n\\n\r\nThe setting is interesting enough, a play on the ancient middle east. There are a series of djinns that inhabit dungeons and can grant \"dungeon capturers\" powerful magical items. Aladdin himself is a magi, a sort of wise man (or wise child?) who has incredible magical powers and is sent to the earth in order to choose his \"king's candidate\" - the idea being that eventually the world will unite under the rule of a single king or leader.\\n\\n\r\nMy main issue with the story was that it felt like the show wasn't sure what it wanted to be. Half the time it's your typical shounen battle series, with long drawn-out fight sequences that spawn multiple episodes, and your standard \"love/friendship\" conquers all conclusions to conflicts. But it also dives pretty deep into ideas of slavery and leadership that go a little beyond what you'd normally find in a shounen. Some of the ideas seem a little mature (as an example, one of the plot lines involves a money-devaluation scheme to bankrupt a country - I'm not sure how much a young viewer would be able to resonate with ideas like that). \\n\\n\r\nArt - 8/10:\\n\\n\r\nI thought the art was well done. I was thrown off a few times when I literally swore I was watching Fairy Tail. I know they're both A-1 productions, but the art style is identical. They must use the same staff of artists, it's really uncanny. Luckily, I enjoy Fairy Tail's art, so this works for me. The animation could be a bit better, but it's about on par with most shounen I've seen.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8/10:\\n\\n\r\nI watched the English dub. Most of the voice acting was solid. A couple choices seemed a bit out of place. The music was good, if not great. All around, pretty solid effort.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 8/10:\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the character work in the show. Given that it's only 25 episodes of what I presume is a fairly long-running story, there's not a ton of development. What development is there is a bit on the nose and repetitive - like Ali Baba getting cursed and having to overcome negative emotions, right after having to do basically the same thing in the conflict with his childhood friend. The same can be said of Aladdin, who basically knows nothing about being a Magi, and his development is a little heavy-handed.\\n\\n\r\nWhat really works, as is often the case in shounen, is the wide variety of likeable and interesting minor characters. I'm not sure if you'd consider Sinbad to be minor here, but he's a great character. Many of the people in his crew, or those from the Ko Empire, are intriguing additions. Child characters are often hit or miss for me, but I liked Aladdin. I'm very much looking forward to seeing how he develops his magic prowess as he comes to understand more and more about himself. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9/10:\\n\\n\r\nI don't know what the metrics are for gauging enjoyment, but I always find the pace that I watch a show goes a long way to telling me how much I'm enjoying it. I have a lot of hobbies that I spend time on, and I'm putting off other things because I just really want to watch the next episode (or five) of whatever show I'm into at the moment, that's a big plus. I moved through the first season of this show pretty quick, and I'm eager to dive into season two.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8/10:\\n\\n\r\nLike I said, sometimes I felt like this show had a bit of an identity crisis, flopping between standard shounen fare aimed at teenage males and ideas that seemed slightly more mature. There was even brief nudity now and then, which is unusual. The battle scenes were fun without being too long (my primary complaint with shounen is that the fight scenes last ten episodes/chapters - I know I'm in the minority there, as a lot of people prefer those super-long battles).  \\n\\n\r\nI'm looking forward to diving into season two, and maybe checking out the manga afterwards. If the story starts to lean more towards the mature issues and shows a bit of originality, it could be quite an impressive anime.",

            "content": "Magi is a weird one. I really enjoyed it on many occasions but there are so many fundamental flaws that I feel I can't ignore. You will notice it wears the face of a good show with politics, fantasy, drama and fighting but it lacks consistency, depth and most importantly: continuity. In many other situations, these things wouldn't matter all that much to me. I overlooked the lack of these things in Fairy Tail, Kill la Kill and Overlord, just to name a few, but the reason I take offence to this anime's lack of these is because it leaks into the other aspects ofthis show that desperately need them. Without spoiling, I will say that this issue causes massive decay for aspects such as risk and development in terms of the story. \\n\\n\r\nNow, of course, there are reasons that I think these things but I will get into them later. What I am most concerned about is how I came ever so close to dropping this anime and, keep in mind, I have only ever dropped one anime (and that was because it simply wasn't compatible with my preferred style of story-telling). Upon starting Magi: LoM, I got some very mixed messages about where the story was going and where the true enemy lied... but.... this is going into story territory, so I may as well just cut to that.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory -\\n\r\nAs I was saying. The story was relatively hard to grasp at first. I'm not saying that it was difficult to understand, just that it struggled to lay the foundation. We start off with Alibaba, who is portrayed as a humble and aspiring person who thanks to the anime's designated 'special character', Aladdin, gets on the wrong side of some rich people and ends up going on this short little quest to get a nice weapon and the freedom to go on an adventure. Here is where we find our first problem, the second that this little arc ends, you might as well completely extinguish it from your memory. Despite a few knacks that could easily be ironed out by an extra episode or two in the Balbadd arc, the first arc, which is integral to making a good first impression and gaining the interest of the viewer, only serves to get Alibaba a weapon. This is especially true if you consider that despite the fact they meet in the first arc, they go through the same meet and greet process as if they need to relearn each other's names! It gets incredibly tedious and it's not until episode 8 or 9 that I actually decided that it may be picking up and resisted the temptation to watch something else.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, this scrutiny is quite temperamental. There are many people out there who may think that this first arc is essential to the pacing of the story or the development of the characters. I would disagree because the story tends to pick up the pace anyway and most of the character development ends up happening later on in the season. But, as I said, this can be subject to opinion.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I will praise the story for is its ability to provide a good villain. While he may be hard to describe due to his conspicuous nature, he never really shows a moment of weakness, which sends a powerful message and actually had me admiring him. Additionally, there are a number of other factors such as politics, schemes, treachery as well as a few psychological elements, but it ends up being wasted due to one simple mistake: They made the good guys too OP. Initially, the size and force of the enemy seemed like a worthy opponent, maybe even a stronger one, but it all fell flat on its face when half of the guys were like - \"I'm bored now\" and just win with one swing. Had they executed this right then they probably could have made it look bad ass, but all we ever see is them succeed so it  ended up being VERY anticlimactic, not to mention disappointing.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound -\\n\r\nBoth of these elements have a very 'old Egyptian' vibe to them. You knew that you were in 'the old world' (as Wikipedia would put it) and I think that these elements did a very good job of depicting that. I'm very reluctant to give either of these categories a higher score than the story that they were depicting but I think that Magi at least deserves credit where its due. The environment and its cultures are very well laid out as well as the magics of the various cast members. Sound wise, I enjoyed it. I found that there were a number of moments where the intense music would often play up a scene to be better than it actually was but that's more of a problem on the stories part. Regardless of your taste in music or opinion of the story, I think that it shouldn't go unmentioned how well these two played their roles.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-\\n\r\nThis was a hard one for me as well. Much like the story, there are some elements that were just shallow and lame while others were deep and interesting. Starting off with the latter: I loved Alibaba as a character (at least after episode 9), he was very determined and adamant to do what he thought was right while still being troubled with doubt and his previous failures. This may seem like standard stuff but the way it was presented enforced his leadership personality and I think it did wonders for him, his relationships and in some cases, the story. As a stand alone character, I think Alibaba would probably be around a 9 for me. Other characters with similar developmental traits consist of Morgiana, Judar and Cassim.\\n\\n\r\nOn the flip side, we have characters that I hated, like Aladdin, who was extremely shallow, arrogant and didn't really do much besides act as a conduit for Alibaba's authority and was sometimes a trump card in battle. They do attempt to make him seem wise and they do throw in a bit of development here and there but in the end its all for nought because of one stupid idea: Let's make this 10-year-old boy a tit loving pervert. Now, boobage is common in anime, as is the young perversion, but when you try and mix comedy relief with the 'wise man' responsibilities provided to you by the plot and then try to seriously develop that character, you're almost doomed to fail. The only way you can avoid failure as an outcome would be to execute it flawlessly. Magi... did not.... not... even... close. He was also pretty useless at times until later on in the season when he suddenly becomes OP, which, as you know, still doesn't turn out well.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-\\n\r\nI hate to have to say that I loved this show despite the fact there is so much wrong with it. It's like having an angel and a devil on each shoulder except the angel doesn't really serve a purpose except to encourage pandering and fanboying. My enjoyment of Magi derives from the latter half of the story. My distaste for Magi derives from the former half of the story. It's certainly a dilemma.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion-\\n\r\nI recommend you watch this. If you agree with me, you'll find it hard to trudge through the first 8-9 episodes but if you can make it past that then you really get into the good stuff and hopefully, the transgressions that I described earlier can be shifted to the back of your head. For me, unfortunately, I'm as pedantic as I'll ever be and as a result, I'm going to have to maintain my position on this show with all of my scrutinies at my back.\\n\\n\r\nIf I were not as nit-picky as I am, I would probably have given this show an 8. That Just goes to show that my reviews are usually one step up from casually subjective and that you should probably read another review, or just take the plunge and go for it.",

The ending doesn't really leave you wanting more, although it does give you more. I only watched this and the Kingdom of Magic. They are both leisurely anime that you can watch progressively. \r\nStory: 10. It had an interesting story with plenty of arcs. It didn't ever just focus on one person and always included the side characters as more than just fillers. To me, it was an anime that just allowed you to relax.\r\nArt: 10. I love this art style so much.It has beautiful colors and backgrounds with just the slightest hint of a magical feel.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10. The voices of the characters suited them well. Also, the music never felt out of place, and I feel that it even added to the story.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8. This is my only lower score. That is mostly because I saw a lot of similarities in characters from different shows/anime. That might just be because of how the characters looked because none really acted like the others. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10. I loved watching this. It's pretty easy to understand and explains the magical parts well. It doesn't leave me confused on what is happening and it is something that you can watch an episode here and there and still understand what is going on.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10. Loved it. Great way to spend an hour or two on every day and to relieve the stress of the day.\\n\\n",
