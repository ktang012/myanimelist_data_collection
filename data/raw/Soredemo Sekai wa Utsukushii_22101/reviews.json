            "content": "There is something about this show that sets itself apart from other shoujo anime that have been coming out as of late. While Soredemo has its share of shoujo tropes, to me it tonally resides in a sort of genre-free zone. This series isn\u2019t a \u201ctypical\u201d shoujo fantasy or romance\u2014the genre here is simply \u201creally good\u201d. Shortly after the first episode, I found that \u2018something\u2019, it has \u2018charm\u2019. This is what has been missing in a lot of recent shoujo which enrichens the magical and alluring atmosphere of the series. Adapted from Dai Shiina's manga, \"Soredemo Sekai wa Utsukushii\" (The World is Still Beautiful), thestory follows a Princess from the Rain Principality in Nike Remercier who was pushed to have an arranged marriage to the person who conquered the world for her country, despite her unwillingness. That person is the Sun King, Livius Orvinus Ifrikia, who she later discovers is not your average King. He has a condescending attitude and not only young for his position but short in height. This is how the charming series begins, these two characters create something special that has an old-school shoujo style and feel to it. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is episodic structured though there is an overarching plot which becomes clear early on in the series. Livi has spent all his years as King in conquering the world due to unfortunate events that happened in the past that have made him grow cold and cruel, he began to distrust those around him. Nike is sent to marry Livi so her country can retain its autonomy after he demanded it. Nike who has the power to call forth the rain was the perfect settlement between the two kingdoms. After both starting off with the wrong foot, these two later develop one of the most charming and believable romances in anime. As the story progresses, Nike helps Livi as he slowly begins to realize that good still exists in this world, that it can be a beautiful place. Though only a year or two in age difference, the way the characters are designed to seem as if Nike was much older than Livi but don't let that put you off, this series proves that this can be overcome if the writing is tasteful and sensitive, and I give full credit to Shiina Dai. \\n\\n\r\nSetting aside the fact that in historical context this sort of relationship is perfectly normal, what makes it work is that the writer presents us with Livi and Nike as people, not numbers, and all a viewer has to do is look at them the same way. If there was ever a series that was made for a studio, it's Soredemo Sekai wa Utsukushii and Studio Pierrot with its old-school, fairy-tale, quasi-European look and tone. The visuals and animation are some of their best work. From the colour palette, backgrounds, landscapes and architectures, making it fit well within the fantasy themes. Character designs are creative and distinctive. Something I have found interesting was that the characters in various episodes wore different clothes ranging from formal to casual and they were well designed. Visually a spectacle reminiscent of a classic Disney film.\\n\\n\r\nThe score is perhaps one of the biggest strengths in the series. It gives off a real majestic feel, something similar to old Disney classics and really puts a mark on the themes and messages that Soredemo Sekai wa Utsukushii tries to convey to the audience. The song, \"Beautiful Rain\" (Tender Rain) by Rena Maeda who is the Voice Actress of Nike becomes a signature musical item that plays when Nike sings to call forth the rain. Her voice is sublime, as soon as the song hits the climax it tends to create a magical moment and leaves you mesmerized. The Opening song, \"Beautiful World\" by Joanna Koike instantly sets the mood, it is catchy and uplifting. The Ending song that is also done by Rena Maeda, \"Promise\" showcases her beautiful voice in a very elegant manner, it's the perfect song to end each episode on. They sure did an excellent job on the casting, again, a lot of praise to Rena Maeda on Nike's voice. It really is the heart and soul of the show, she really brings her character to life and compliments Nike's personality. Nobunaga Shimazaki had a tough task ahead of him while casting Livi's character, I thought it was an interesting choice as normally a woman would have been cast. Glad to tell you that Nobunaga Shimazaki does great, he works at capturing the dichotomy between Livi\u2019s appearance and his stature because he manages to make him vulnerable without putting on a silly attempt to sound like a child.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting characters compliment Nike and Livi greatly, especially Neil who is Livi's loyal butler and tutor who guides him through his campaign as King. His reactions to bizarre situations and silly antics that he observes or participates in are hilarious. To Highlight once again on Nike and Livi\u2019s relationship on why it\u2019s so amazing. You see two characters that deal with each other on remarkably equal terms. They\u2019re complex, strong-willed and smart people who don\u2019t want to be taken for granted.  Because of the premise\u2014Livi being young, yet a preternaturally smart and gifted Head of State\u2014you have the basis of the romance being two characters whom each want more than to be protected by the other.  It\u2019s a slyly wonderful basis for a romance story where the principals operate on equal terms, and that\u2019s exactly how it played out. Their personalities and traits clash but they make it work, there is definitely an emotional-need type connection between the two, they even look incomplete when not together.\\n\\n\r\nThe romance doesn't feel forced despite the arrangement between the two, it feels rather natural and there is a real connection between them. Take Nike's power for example. Her inspiration to calling forth the rain is by seeing the beauty in the world through the one who wishes for the rain. Livi is incapable of seeing such things at first but Nike connects with him emotionally and becomes his saviour, makes him realize how beautiful the world really is despite the trials and tribulations that life throws at you. These two have come to love and respect each other that they want to be sure the moment they choose is the right one.  They\u2019re mature enough to understand that they\u2019re still immature and have grown to love each other with patience. Thankfully, while the subject matter is taken seriously, the series itself retains a sense of light fun. The humour is multi-faceted, sometimes it's slapstick, sometimes it's a little more adult. Surprisingly, the series occasionally breaks the fourth wall, which is a delight for fans of meta-humour and this is very much created by Nike and Livi's relationship.\\n\\n\r\nSoredemo Sekai wa Utsukushii throws together a bit of everything. It's an adventure, it's a love story, there is magic, there is a monarchy, there are action sequences and comedy. The show does a careful balancing act of entertaining the audience with a bit of each, all the whilst ensuring to never take itself too seriously. There are some good suspense and a lot of heartfelt moments. There is a serenity within the series while also being fun and full of life. It's really one of the most charming series I have seen in a long time for shoujo and this was never more proudly on display than in the finale, which wore its heart on its sleeve in a way very few anime do. To put it more precisely, Soredemo Sekai wa Utsukushii is a diamond in the rough. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I really feel like this anime just has a way of getting you sucked into the story. Yes it's shoujo, yes it's romance, but it's an enchanting story being told. And it's not that typical \"oh well he's a king & I'm a princess\" *automatically falls in love* Not even close! He threw her in jail when Livi first met Nike xD It's a story that takes place in a distant era, but it's definitely not what you expect!\r\nStory: 8/10- What is to really admire about this story is that it's not that shoujo that's all about the romance and overly sweet moments. There's actions,and things you wouldn't expect a princess to ever do! It has a define plot, though it's pretty simple; but it gets it point across without being too complex. Just seeing the level of character building between the two protagonists and how they change gradually is just great. Nothing seems too sudden, but just right.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10- The art is pretty colorful. Nothing is ever bland, but just a balance of beautiful colors. The animation overall is very nice and neat. But it's nothing over-the-top. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10- The music for this anime is hands down perfect. Maeda Rena's voice is beautiful. She's the voice actor for Nike & the singer for the opening, closing, and of course the \"Tender Rain\" song! The lyrics for the songs themselves are in sync for the overall anime. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10- It's not common when I find an anime with nice development without over doing it or not enough. The main characters are a winner in this. Livi's past isn't fully exposed to the point where you know EVERYTHING, but just enough were us as the viewer is satisfied. Nike's past is  also like this. But since we meet her family later in the series, hers is more developed in a way. Overall, all the supporting characters are nicely done and aren't a nuisance ^^ But even with that, there are still some questions you might be asking yourself by the last few moments of episode 12 ;)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10- From episode one to now, I have loved every minute. Maybe it's because I am a sucker for romance, or maybe it's because this anime is a refresher. A lot of anime nowadays is becoming redundant and isn't as unique. But this anime hits home of being a new eye opener. Even with the plot being nothing completely special, just the characters themselves are enjoyable & the music. Music in this anime doesn't go wrong, at all!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10- Loved it! And I recommend this anime is anyone. :3",

            "content": "Romance is the oldest story in the world. The story of Romance that involving two kingdoms/empire is one of the most classic stories that ever made. Several authors write the story by giving the sweetest moment between the couple that exist in the story. And now, Soredemo Sekai wa Utsukushii continue the legacy of that classic era. Well, if you look deeply inside the plot, Soredemo Sekai Wa Utsukushi have the same typical romance comedy plot, but it's capable to represents the main feeling of the story itself. Soredemo succeed brings all the emotion on the screen, it has great plot although not the greatestplot that ever exist.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation of Soredemo Sekai wa Utsukushii is clear and neat. It has well-produced  backgrounds, and visual effects. The eye maybe a little bit different from the manga series, but it's fine though since the animation is neat.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the sound, Soredemo have  decent sound settings. The opening \"Beautiful World\" is matched with the entire series, while the ending \"Promise\" sung by Rena Maeda (The seiyuu of Nike) is more forgotten when compared with the opening song. The voice actors did decent jobs while bringing such character to the screen.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character in Soredemo Sekai wa Utsukushii is not flat, they classified in a beautiful way. There are developments between the main characters, as the story running, they learn each other past, and with that past, they can create a beautiful relationship. The other characters besides the main character is a bit flat, there has to be an explanation for this.\\n\\n\r\nSometimes exciting, sometimes not...., Soredemo has a see-saw enjoyment, I found my brain hard to deciding when I stop or when I continue to watch the series. The main enjoyment is at the edge of the story or should I say the climax. But in general, it entertains me...\\n\\n\r\nIt is recommended for the fans of Shoujo genres. Since it's a shoujo, male viewers maybe not recommended to watch this anime, some of them may found this boring. My passion in this anime is an adaptation of a second season..., well just hope that happen   \\n",

            "content": "Does rock-paper-scissors determine the fate of everything? Not really but for Nike Lemercier, the fourth and youngest princess of Rain Dukedom, she\u2019s about to find out just how much her life will change with just a game. Despite her reluctance, she is to marry the Sun King Livius, not for an everlasting relationship but for her country\u2019s sake. Facing the problem of annexation, she travels to the Sun Kingdom for a marriage, one she thought was never meant to be. And boy, was she wrong.\r\nFirst thought regarding the series primarily deals with its adaptation. The anime covers roughly 18 chapters of the fantasy shoujo manga,written by Dai Shiina. The author\u2019s expertise in the field of shoujo has earned her the 34th Hakusensha Athena grand prize in 2009. Now her current work Soredemo Sekai Wa Utsukushii (This World is Still Beautiful) is a centerpiece to her ideas. Crafted by classic shoujo themes in a fantasy setting, the series tells about a very oddball duo \u2013 a young princess and a king of a kingdom. \\n\\n\r\nDespite the show displaying some crass and generic concepts, it is surprisingly light on its feet. The show takes the direction of a fantasy shoujo and transcends it into an elevated atmosphere of energy with its characters. As the king of Sun Kingdom, Livius Orvinus Ifrikia (better known as Livius) is one such character with a huge prowess despite his age and appearance. From what we know, he was able to conquer the world, rid of government corruption, and seize power through conquest in a short span of just three years. But for someone his size and age, it\u2019s hardly believable at first. That is, until we find out more about his inner character. That\u2019s where Nike comes in who brings the best out of him. For starters though, Nike herself is shown to be a curious girl. Her journey to the Sun Kingdom ends up her losing her luggage, getting almost mugged, and treated with dismay by some of the commoners there. Rather than going vengeful at her condition however, Nike displays a more responsible personality when she is helps out some folks out of her kind heart. And from there on, it\u2019s easy to realize that Nike is a selfless girl, one with philanthropic traits and puts others above herself. It\u2019s from these traits that we see a different side between her and Livius as a couple.\\n\\n\r\nMuch to Nike\u2019s shock and perhaps some of the audience as well, Livius\u2019 appearance is not much different than those of a child. Standing perhaps at only 5 feet, he is a character who has accomplished unbelievable tasks. We also learn that Livius, as a person, wasn\u2019t always born like this. Through the resourceful flashbacks inserted into the series, it\u2019s shown that Livius\u2019 life wasn\u2019t always as glamourous as his current self. While his father is a king, Livius\u2019 mother is no more than a commoner. And after her death, it seems to awoken something inside of the child. As for that moment, his desire to set about a new world order comes to fruition. Throughout the series, Livius displays leadership traits and rules his kingdom with an iron fist. Although not necessarily violent or power hungry, he has a commanding presence with an ability to lead. Perhaps this could also be a fa\u00e7ade though. One could interpret that his ambition to conquer the world is for her mother\u2019s sake or rather for forget about his past and painful memories. Because whenever he thinks of his mother, she really would be dead in his thoughts. Thankfully, we have Nike who plays a princess, savior, and wife all the same time for this young boy.\\n\\n\r\nTaken for granted, there\u2019s much capability between Nike and Livius. They came from different backgrounds, vastly contrasting personalities, and appearance wise makes the duo look like they came from different planets. Although this isn\u2019t initially a good set up for partners, the two progresses throughout the series. They risk lives for each other and develops an attachment that goes from marriage to lovers. In essence, Nike is the light that shines upon Livius\u2019 darkened heart. It\u2019s shown in the series that Livius\u2019 personality can contrast vastly depend on various circumstances. In one instance, he becomes so jealous and angry that an order to send his own uncle to prison simply for a misunderstanding was issued. His actions could be interpreted as those of a child in this way; almost like a metaphor like a toy being taken away from him. But that\u2019s not entirely true at all, because Livius doesn\u2019t treat Nike like a toy. As the series progresses, he shows different sides of him as a person rather than a king and even develops feelings for the princess. In respect, Nike also seemingly holds similar feelings that connects the duo through their very unusual bonding. It\u2019s a fantasy story of two people coming together in all the unbelievable ways. Nike\u2019s ability to summon rain is just one such astonishing way, a technique that even make Livius in awe. \\n\\n\r\nAs their relationship progresses, there are also obstacles whether it\u2019s characters such as Livius\u2019 fianc\u00e9 Luna and Uncle, Nike\u2019s side of her family, or just being with someone with the status of a king itself. The way the show takes direction shows how strong their connection becomes on various circumstances. And responding to these circumstances become pivotal to create a dynamic atmosphere for their relationship. In retrospect, the show crafts this concept with clever development. Although it has clich\u00e9 ideas, the show portrays it as honest and charming. It\u2019s also delightful to see how the King progresses not as a ruler, but as a person doing normal things thanks to Nike. In fact, Nike display the anti-thesis of a spoiled princess. She is able selfless and kind at heart. Their constant bickering can be interpreted as amusing as they learn what it really means to be \u2018engaged\u2019. Such a simple term mean a lot in this this show for it brings out the best out of both of these characters in the end. Don\u2019t believe me? Try laying even a finger on Nike and you\u2019ll feel the wrath of a very pissed off king.\\n\\n\r\nThe show has its side of humor that is displayed with tricky bits of execution. For one, the relationship between Nike and Livius can seem a bit substantial given their contrasting appearances. It can give the audience a wrong impression with their appearances as husband and wife in a bedroom. But rather than seeing them from an inappropriate angle, it\u2019s more thoughtful to view the duo as a pair with much more to learn. What we also get from the show is also the amount of energy both appealing and emotional. For the appealing side, there\u2019s the delightful moments between Nike and Livius. The emotional aspects flirts with human nature and instinct such as insecurity, jealousy, and pride. These aren\u2019t just bestowed upon our lovable duo but to other characters such as Livius\u2019 personal butler Neil. His overprotectiveness can be borderline out of control. For Nike\u2019s side, the higher ups in her family has plans of their own to keep Nike as \u201ctheirs\u201d. Onto a more childish angle, we also get the oldest trick in the book \u2013 childhood crushes. Do understand that the show does also appeal to its more dramatic side. Like mentioned before, the show\u2019s flashbacks aren\u2019t just for show-and-tell but rather as a way to dissect piece by piece of the characters\u2019 image. We learn a lot from childhood pasts especially for Livius that we can also feel pity for.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork is bright and colorful with Studio Pierrot in charge. Known for their habits for adding anime original content (as seen from the first half of the pilot episode), there\u2019s an incentive to make this show\u2019s visuals look credible. And thankfully, I\u2019d say they pulled it out beautifully. As the title \u201cThis World is Still Beautiful\u201d, the show\u2019s animation quality is exactly that. The Sun Kingdom has lavish landscapes, natural features, and the castle that Livius resides shows his testimony in power. Character designs are also creative with decorative clothing that characters wear on traditions. Other characters also display credible appearances whether they are soldiers, maids, or even a prime minister. Perhaps the one character that contradict such credibility would be the king himself with his appearance. \\n\\n\r\nWhile soundtrack doesn\u2019t score the home run for the series, its message does. While the main OP song has a smooth pacing and coordination, it\u2019s the theme song in the show that truly counts. Nike\u2019s singing is an embodiment for symbolizing hope and rebirth. The song \u201cTender Rain\u201d is a prominent feature throughout the series that is much more than just simple water pouring down on earth. It acts as a symbolic way for Livius\u2019 progress as a character with him undergoing changes. The song itself is also sung with energy and empowerment as Nike\u2019s voice really means it for every word. Otherwise, the OST of the show balances itself well along with characters\u2019 voice mannerisms. \\n\\n\r\nSurprise is a word I would describe my feelings towards this show. What is seemingly a clich\u00e9 shoujo here is presented with an attractive appeal for its setting, characters, and ideas. Its balance of the show\u2019s story and comedy matches well. It\u2019s insightful to see how much Livius change especially after getting acquainted with Nike. And while the story is predictable with cheesy lines and moments, it\u2019s also honest and innocent. For a story to be bought out this way, it\u2019s also definitely beautiful.\\n",

            "content": "With the glaring number of praising reviews, and a decent enough of the overall, I had thought to find at least something that would temporarily be a time-killer of sorts. Unfortunately, what I found was a show riddled with problems, unbearable story and poor characters. Throughout the entire show, the only thing that stuck out was production value - something that matters the least in the show of this genre. \r\nWhat Soredemo Sekai wa Utsukushii has is not a story - it's rather an abomination, shrouded in overlapping layers of discomfort, insanity and terrible writing. Story is crippled by its inability to stay consistent, subtleor thought-provoking in any kind of a manner. By the time the torture was finally over, I could do nothing but laugh at how terrible it was. You can go as far as calling it a disgrace to the world of literature if you will ... and you wouldn't be far off. So, what's wrong with it, you wonder? \\n\\n\r\nThe premise in itself is not bad, and the first episode does, somewhat, provide a hook onto the show. However, it already began showcasing the major problems the story has - the writer had absolutely zero idea what the hell he/she wanted to do with it. Plot-hole galore is already present by the time you've watched half of the anime, and you can't help but wonder did anyone even have a grasp of what was supposed to be happening within the world created. If you're looking for a political warfare - forget it. If you're looking for economic discussion of kingdoms - forget it. If you're looking for wars - forget it. If you're looking for struggle to reign over kingdom - forget it. If you're looking for romance - forget it. This story doesn't offer any of those in the slightest measure of what should be considered acceptable. Ranging from the actions of characters that are just completely random, to the drama that's so forced you just cringe, to the sob-filled flashbacks that only add more confusion to what already is \"why and how and what\" type of a show. I won't go into much detail, but here's one: in the first episode, it's showcased that Nike is unable to use her powers while hungry. While it was done in a comical way, it still set a standard of rule within the world. Suffice to say, you can forget it. Furthermore, she made a big fuss about making rain, but each time she summons it, she's singing THE EXACT SAME SONG. The rules this world sets are ignored on every single corner. Furthermore, in the later episodes, the guards / soldiers / servants / king / everyone, let the princess partake in an event that could potentially lead to her death. No. Just, no. \\n\\n\r\nThen, we get the introduction of \"villains\". It even pains me to call them so. Their motives and reasoning are pathetic, and even more insulting is that they give up on them so quickly it feels as if it was pointless to have them to begin with. For instance, bad guy number one, was against the marriage because he felt the rain to be bad omen to the Kingdom of Sun. He even went as far as to try and assassinate the princess. Minutes come and go, rain, viola, refreshing, I approve. I won't go into more details for fear of spoiling it (to be honest, there isn't much to spoil so ... ah, well), but, rest assured, that if you're looking for a story, stay as far away as possibly can.\\n\\n\r\nSome may argue that this wasn't supposed to be a story-driven series, and that characters carry it (I'll come to them), but if you bother trying to put a front of the story, at least make sure that front doesn't fall apart before story even begins. The author clearly abandons the rules he/she set, and uses things on convenience of the characters, essentially nullifying any possible conflict that would arise, rendering it pointless in a nutshell. \\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned beforehand, the only thing worth a damn in this show is the production. I enjoyed character designs, the way they did rain on certain occasions, as well as more than a few background shots. Animation, on the other hand, is ... average at best. It does its job, but the factor of excitement is nowhere to be found, since nothing about animation excited me in this show. From the information I've gathered, another thing that's simply worth of another \"what?\" is that Nike is 17 years old while the King is 15 years old. Why is there such a difference in height between the two of them I cannot answer. This also ties in to the story - is someone who's 17 really that much more of an \"adult\" than someone who's 15? \\n\r\nOn the sound side, there were more than a few pieces I enjoyed, but I really hated the repetitive \"call down the rain\" song - it wasn't even that good to begin with. You'll be skipping both OP and ED one episode in, so don't even bother. \\n\\n\r\nNow, as far as the characters go, they aren't as terrible as the story, but they're still quite dreadful. The biggest complaint I've got is the inconsistency and the backtrack of development, or rather the sudden development. Nike is referred to as a tomboy, but as far as I'm concerned, she's a bad example of one. She's rash, at times brainless and flat out ignorant, and, while you may say it's part of her charm, I'll say it's part of why she's a terrible character. She hauls the same mistakes over and over again, seemingly, again, abandoning the principle of \"follow what you set, goddamnit\". For a breakdown: in one of the scenes, she wakes up next to the King, and she isn't embarrassed at all. Same thing happens the next time, she is. She gets pettily jealous when someone showcases affection for the King, but is a complete, brainless moron when it's the other way around. The fact that this show even mustered courage to say that she had charmed the Kingdom into her liking is just impossible. To begin with, I have no idea how she even charmed the King.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the King, his name is Livius, or Livi for short. He's introduced as heartless and lacking in compassion - by that introduction, he should have had Nike beheaded in the very first episode. But that's just a nitpick. His character takes turns in every episode, round and round, like an never-ending roller-coaster. He first lacks love, then he doesn't, then he suddenly does again, and so on and so forth. Honestly, with the way he is, the idea of him \"conquering the world\" is not just unfathomable - it's impossible. I'd rather live alone in the desert than have him act as my king. You can attribute that to the age, sure, but how was he able to conquer the world then? No, he wasn't. He acts more like a spoiled prince rather than the King, even before Nike \"changed him\". I won't dwell into much detail (for fear of spoiling, again, I guess ...), but rest assured that neither the characters nor the story can salvage somewhat above average production. \\n\\n\r\nThe only other character that's worth a damn in this show is the butler, but he's mostly just a comedic relief. Other characters are there when it's convenient or when the \"conflict\" is required. The only and only way this \"story\" progresses is when a random character, unheard of before, is introduced and our heroes must find a way to overcome the obstacle. The. Only. Way. Think about it for a moment. \\n\\n\r\nDid I enjoy SSwU? Nope. Aside from a few funny moments, this one's nothing but the soup whose main ingredient, the characters, are terrible, coupled with even worse story, and a decent production to cheat you off the foul taste. The \"resolutions\" of \"conflicts\" aren't satisfactory, the \"conflicts\" themselves are just nonsensical and boring, the writing is often so over-the-top it crosses the \"cringe-worthy\" barricade, and a few laughs that you can get from it won't satisfy you in the tiniest bit. \\n\\n\r\nDo I recommend it? If you can stuff through 12 episodes of terrible writing, just to get the predictable ending you saw coming first episode in, sure. IF you can stuff through 12 episodes of nothing but random conflicts (and I mean, NOTHING else), that somehow \"develop\" our characters, be my guest. If you can do all those things and more, and after finishing it can still say \"Yeah, I enjoyed that\", I commend you. You are bigger man than I am.",

For seiyuu to sing and fill the main character's voices isn't an easy task but she did it really well.When she speaks,she isn't showing a wimpy-squeak voice,instead it shows a brave yet kind voice and when she sings,it shows an elegant and kind voices which makes me shiver in aweee-ness.

            "content": "What does this anime remind me of? Ans, \"The King and I\" yes a classic 1956 movie (with its 1999 re-make) that you're great grandma has probably watched when she was younger and re-watch several times in some of those classic channels.......that is, if they have access to 'Turner Classics\" or \"MGM Classic, \" hey, let's face it, it was almost identical  to the classic where the king is a cold and uptight ruler and the girl is an independent outspoken individual, even thought there is that reverse thing, where in the classic it a east meets west kind of thing, here it wasmore of a west meets east and also it has the element from beauty and the beast where beauty was force stay with the beast, while in this anime  in was more of a reverse lolicon  or more like a sotacon where beauty ( I'm guessing she's somewhere between 18-21) was forced to become this kiddo's (I'm also guessing that he is somewhere between 11-13 years old) bride ( or maybe his playmate) but either way the romance and adventure really did play well or at least plotwise, so here are my ratings for this anime:\\n\\n\r\nStory: Outstanding 10.\\n\\n\r\nRefer to the explanation above. Take note the score is only for the plot where it does have some similarities with the classic movie. \\n\\n\r\nArt: Good 7.\\n\\n\r\nI like the way Nike is illustrated, though she more of a sexier version of Anna Harriette Leonowens. Also, I kinda like the Chinese Tibetan motif that were featured in the last 3 episode of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Poor 3.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I may have liked the opening theme, and Nike's song \"Tender Rain\" but for the song \"Tender Rain\", well it was touching at first, but it becomes annoying later on. Also, Livi's voice would have been better of if it was continuously  done by seiyuu Kudou, Haruka, instead of Shimazaki, Nobunaga, because an early teen's voice doesn't matured up until he is 14 years of age and frankly Livi doesn't look like he is 14. Nike's voice on the other hand should have that tsundere tone co'z quite frankly Maeda Rena's tone wasn't tsundere enough, also, I can't understand why Nike's grandma's farewell rain was done by a younger girl, it would have been more appropriate  if  Granny's farewell rain song was done by an opera singer, so its either studio Pierrot and VAP were cutting cost or Japan doesn't have any local opera singers. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Dreadful 2.\\n\\n\r\nThis is the part were I would ask......as to WTF was series creator  Shiina, Dai thinking for conceptualizing such thought about a grown up being in a relationship with a kid? Such character concept of this series' creator was enough of me to give this category a low score, let's go over the main character's\\n\\n\r\nNike Remercier- Ok, I have no problems of her marry off to a person of nobility, but my peeves about her stems from the fact that she is a person of nobility who happens to be rough around the edges, now to  me I see it as a good thing where it shows humility, what I don't like was that her suppose husband is a brat and she doesn't do anything to get away from him, in fact whatever bet she had with her sisters can be declared as null and void. Now the conflict here was how does she sees Livi, does she see him as a poor soul that she took upon herself to comfort him or has she already develop that lolicon thing for him?\\n\\n\r\nLivius Orvinus- He is another reason why I give this category a low score, I just couldn't fathom as to why a boy like him would go for a MILF like Nike, when he could have just went looking for Amaluna, also WTF was series creator  Shiina, Dai thinking for letting a kid do a man's job. Frankly, I kinda see him as a kid entering puberty and probably he can see Nike naked and do get punish and I'm thinking that he gets to  loose his virginity to her as well.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Fair 6.\\n\\n\r\nMainly, there were Episodes that I find entertain and there are those that were a drag and that's the reason why I give this category its score.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Decent 4.\\n\\n\r\nThe story plot may be good, but the real let down was the fact that this anime has that reverse lolicon thingy, but then again it was decent enough to be view by everybody, except if kids would be watching this then their parent are gonna have a lengthy explanation about the cougar and tadpole relationship.   \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

It stands out with it's unusual setting, great and not clich\u00e9 at all characters and the great music.\r\nStory:\r\nIt was pretty original. I like the world the author created, although I couldn't understand everything about it. The story was a bit too fast paced for my taste in the first half, but it got more well balanced towards the end. It felt a bit over dramatic to me at some parts, maybe because twelve episodes are not enough to really get into the story and feel moved by the drama. I did feeled pretty movedin the last 2-3 episodes though.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art was nothing outstanding, but it wasn't bad either. I liked the way the eyes were drawned.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThis was my favourite part of this anime. The music is great. I really like the rain summoning song, it's so touching and I can never get enough of it. The opening was pretty nice too and the ending was great. The voice acting was really good too. I liked how Princess Nike didn't have a over high pitched voice like most girls in anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe two main characters were really well developed. We got to learn about their past and how they became the way they were. The way their relationship developped was really nice too, it felt realistic. Most supporting characters like the butler didn't get much development, but they were funny and interesting. Some of them could have been removed without changind anything, like the elder trio (I never understood what their role in this story was).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI really liked this anime, the first episode really got me hooked and I enjoyed most episodes a lot.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nIt is a great shoujo and I don't get why it isn't more popular. I really liked the older woman with younger man (or child here) kind of relationship. It's so unusual but worked great here. A must watch for fans of romance that are getting tired of the typical shoujos with shy girls and strong boys.",

I will try my best to ignore the story  as much as possible, so it won't ruin the fun for you.\r\n~ I never felt this good watching a shoujo anime since lovely complex.Its literally a lot similar to lovely complex too because of the height difference between the main couple and humor, what surprised me the most the animation is done by \"Studio Pierrot\", YEA YOU HEARDME RIGHT \"Studio Pierrot\" which is responsible for naruto's artwork.

One more thing I must tell, you must not skip the opening song as the character builds up in the opening episode after episode, it feels great to see that)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- I gave it 9 because by the end there are still some questions that left unanswered, but definitelty has high re-watch value for me!",

I put off watching it for quite some time, until I had caught up with all the currently airing anime I'd been interested in, and in my idleness, I decided to watch it.  \r\nI marathon-ed this anime in two days.\r\nThe story was not the most colorful or elaborate, but it was rich in culture and backstory.  I must say, if you are a sucker for backstory, it shall be sated here, ratherthan left out to wither away in the recesses of space and time, like so many other anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe art, while well above average, fell short of remarkable.  It made the anime much more visually appealing than I was expecting, and despite the \"bishounen\" vibe throughout, the characters were not overly flowery and obnoxious in that regard.  The environment was done beautifully, with especial care given to the sky and to the castle art.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound in this anime was quite nice.  I would say it was not necessarily unique or remarkable in the everyday moments, but the anime focuses a lot around the heroine's singing, which is done in such a way the viewer enjoys it more each time, rather than a taxing noise to fast forward through as the producers provide tiring filler content.\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters were enticing and colourful, providing a refreshing reprieve from the blase stereotypes of females who are over sensitive and never forgive, and males who are either too brutal or too soft.  The heroine is strong, but nothing superhuman, and the male character is emotionally realistic to the experiences he owns.  I would say my only desire would have been for the secondary characters to be a bit less flat.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime carries a dark and flavorful theme throughout, and I would recommend it to everyone.",

            "content": "There goes another anime that I've really enjoyed. I felt like its been ages since I had another one that really can suck up my time with. I've literally finished the whole series without stopping. I don't usually write reviews , but I just had to write this one.\r\nWhat's more , it is a Shoujo Anime where you expect a handsome prince pops out fells in love at first sight to a not famous princess . Well no. A Shoujo, but not the typical ones. \r\nSoredemo Sekai wa Utsukushii (The World is Still Beautiful) really caught my attention after watching the 1st episode. Not justthe 1st, each of the episodes just had its way to make you continue watching . I tend to get very excited when each episode have its climax. Guess what? Every single episode has achieved that. To me, a good anime means craving for the next episode and the other.\\n\\n\r\nStory + Character 9/10 - Since this anime contains fantasy with anime logic. I'll go with the flow and not to mix whats real and whats not. As how the story flows , I fell in love with both the MCs. It is beautiful looking how these two progress after each episode. Its amazing that the story understand's a viewer mind. They make it in a way, that all viewers would want. Simply amazing.  \\n\\n\r\nArt + Sound 8/10 - Coming from a 2014 Anime, Art was good. Ah yes, the openings, endings, the song that the Female MC sung. - Tender Rain. Everything just fits . Listening twice is more than enough to love the song. I also love how the Female MC sang the song - tender rain. Judging from her character , don't you think it fits just fine? Gave an 8 , as you might realize the song 'tender rain' has been used quite often at the start of the first few episodes. But later that, the mood was spot on, just right . Instead, you wont get tired listening it over again. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10 - Not much to say here, I've clearly enjoyed myself after watching this anime. You can tell that everything was planned perfectly to make such a good romance story. Good way to attract a viewer's mind. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 9.5/10 - I don't see why such Romance/Shoujo Anime like this , is not well known. You may consider this as a typical Shoujo Anime since this is kind of romance that most people wants. All I can say that this anime is more than a level higher than average. Definitely one of the best shoujos animes out there. You will definitely like this.  \\n\\n\r\nThis is all based on my own opinion . No hard feelings . Any feedbacks is appreciated .\\n",

The leading characters of this anime are outstanding, I could not help to love that sassy young king, and I love an outgoing female like Nike. \r\nDont let the factthat the king is a \"kid\" scare you from watching this anime, he is probably my favorite male protagonist (of romance anime) ever, you can bear in mind that he is about 2-3 year younger than Nike, the female protagonist, so the age difference is not that big anyway \\n\\n\r\nThere is a uniqueness to this anime, I loved the sory and the art, it is fitting, and the music is really bringing it all together, I really enjoyed watching it, and that is why this anime receives a strong 10 from me.\\n\\n\r\nWARNING! This is an anime that gets you so hooked that you will watch all the episodes in one day. Haha :D",

            "content": "This is technically the first time I encountered an anime that had a beautiful scene every single moment. All you think at the end is \"I want more\" and \"I need to read the manga now!!!\" This is by far my number one anime of the year. Everything about the anime is astonishing and beautiful. When I mean beautiful I mean beautiful.\r\nStory: Everything about the story had a cause and an effect. They had moments where love, had, sadness come into play. You can tell that each and every scene in the story would touch your heart in a second. It was fun and hilarious.Everything was well put together. The idea of a saddened child sun king falling in love with a princess from the rain is so cute and so well developed. You can tell that they start gradually have feelings for each other. Also when the princess can't stop falling in love with him and keeps thinking about him makes me want to scream with delight. It will satisfy you, trust me.\\n\\n\r\nArt: When I looked at the art the first time, all I could think was how beautifully all the characters were made. They each had their own personality which matched how they looked like. The flowers, trees, rain had their own little sparkle in them and it was overly perfect. It was brightly colorful and when the characters have their own little emotion fit it was cute and funny.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The singing was amazing! I could never stop listening to it to the fact where I downloaded the song to my I-pad, computer, and CD. The opening song was fun and light. The character's voices didn't have any flaws and matched the mouth movements which some animes lack. I couldn't ask for a more beautiful sound than this.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Livi and Nike are my most favorite anime characters in the whole world. They were fun and loving. They had a spark to them that most animes don't contain. The side characters has their own story behind them which makes the anime more interesting. Everyone was so enjoyable and I couldn't get enough.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I love love love it! Like I said it was fun, sad, funny, and every other emotion you can think of that'll fit this anime. I could never ask for less. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: I mean of course i'll give it a 10! Why wouldn't I? It was a truly amazing anime to watch and I enjoyed every second of it. I'm not just saying it, I literally mean it and I recommend this anime to you and your friends. It's truly amazing and at the end you want more of it!",

            "content": "The World Is Still Beautiful is a shoujo fantasy romantic comedy-drama set within a fictional land where a princess of the Rain Dukedom named Nike is arranged to be married to the Sun Kingdom's young ruler Livius in order for the Rain Dukedom to maintain its sovereignty. The series is mainly focused on the growing bond between Nike and Livius, exploring Livius' traumatic past and exploring the political hostilities that erupt among both factions in response to the marriage.\r\nThe biggest strengths to this series come in the nice amount of exploration it offers up to with Nike and Livius' lives. In spite of its 12episode run, the series explores the types of rule that both the Rain Dukedom and Sun Kingdom fall under, characters within the series with varying levels of relationship to our two leads and hostilities with both sides that involve the marriage with our leads. Beyond a few shallow characters connected to the Sun Kingdom, many relevant characters within the series get enough fleshing out for you to understand their personal beliefs, connection to our leads and what desires they have for their marriage thus there isn't much in the way of black-and-white morality to this series except for the early episode arc of Nike trying to get her marriage to Livius approved by a crooked Sun Kingdom priest. The arc where Livius and Nike visit the Rain Dukedom offers the best developments in the series for me thanks to the credible and relatable concerns that members of Nike's family have with the marriage that lead them to cause the arc's main conflict in regard to Nike's power to manipulate rain.\\n\\n\r\nOur main leads also get their developments as well with fleshing out of their characters and the gradual development of their relationship. Due to Livi's tragic past, he developed a cold outlook on life and found it difficult to trust others. The presence of Nike in his life leads our king to mellow out of his cynical mentality as he comes to gradually open up to her and settle hostilities he had with close acquaintances while still maintaining his cold facade. While \"opposites attract\" style romances are nothing new in anime, the one between Livius and Nike is a convincing one thanks to the two coming to understand and trust in one another throughout the show's run. Only low points with the storytelling are some hit and miss efforts with comedy coming from spats that our two leads get into and some unexplored elements of the series when one of Nike's family members voiced their concerns about the potential abuse that could arise with Nike's power.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, the series is on the average side for a 2014 title. There is a good amount of detail and color shading put into scenery and character designs, but it is nowhere as rich and vast in detail as what titles like Nagi no Asukara and Terror in Resonance delivered that year. The animation is also a bit on the average end as well as there are noticeable shortcuts that are taken and the only notable high points with it came from Nike's use of her power to create rain.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, The World is Still Beautiful offers an excellent exploration of the developments of Nike and Livius' relationship, as well as focusing on how others connected to them are affected by the relationship. If you're a fan of shoujo anime, this is one of the more better recent offerings for the demographic worth checking out.",

            "content": "This is my first review, so bear with me if it's bad, or doesn't make sense. To be honest, I was really surprised with this show. I haven't watched a lot of shoujo, but from the ones I watched, they were all really cliche, having a strong male and an innocent female as the protagonists, such as Kimi Ni Todoke. Before I started watching this, I had expected it to be the same, but I found out that wasn't the case.\r\nStory- I thought the plot was great. Compared to other shoujo's, this has one of the most original story lines I have seen. It's notcliche in any way, and it's not too simple or too complex to where the viewer is bored or confused with what's going on. I felt as if some scenes were over-dramatic, more than they needed to be, but I didn't really feel as if it took away from the overall enjoyment of the show. And it's not all focused on lovey-dovey scenes, there is small bit of action, and comedy scenes, all balanced together keeps the story interesting.\\n\\n\r\nArt- The art/animation was well done. Colors and backgrounds popped out, and it was consistent throughout the show. Not the best, but I didn't find anything particularly wrong with it. \\n\\n\r\nSound- The music was amazing. The OP and ED were very enjoyable to listen to, and the rain song was beautiful and touching. The BGM's were placed in the right scenes, and it made the show more enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- I love the characters of this show. They are all interesting in their own way, and I didn't find myself hating any of the characters. Nike is a strong female lead, having more of a tom-boy personality than what you would see in a normal Shoujo, but she does have a girly side as well. Livius is a strong male lead, perfect for Nike. Despite his age, he is very mature tough, but he does have his weaknesses as well. As the story progresses, you get to learn more about them as characters and their past experiences, and see them change throughout the show. You also get to see how their relationship changes, their love for each other slowly blossom. Neil was more of a side character, but he added a bit of comedy and humor to show. There are more characters, such as the three old men, but this covers it for the main.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- Overall, I really enjoyed this show. Starting from episode one, I was hooked, each episode kept making me want to watch more. Does well in every aspect, and I'm surprised this wasn't more popular. If your a fan of romance like me, or just looking for good anime show to watch, then this is worth checking out. Of course, everyone had their own opinions, but I was quite satisfied with this show. Second season?\\n\\n",

It is still a puzzle why this anime has such low ratings because if anything Soredemo Sekai wa Utsukushii deserves a higher rating than it is getting.\r\nHaving had Soredemo Sekai wa Utsukushii on my system for up to a year, i finally decided to give it a watch, i initially went into it with the assumption it would be another clich\u00e9 filled garbage of an anime, but after watching the first episode i felt compelled to watch the next episode because something about it looked promising, afterwatching the second episode i just knew i would totally love this anime, \"This\"  i said to myself \"Is what i have been searching for in a romantic anime\", after finishing i came online looking for a second season, an OVA or a movie but unfortunately there was none, so here i am writing a review.\\n\\n\r\nThe story, although unique, is quite simple, what really made this a great watch was the natural development between the characters, they start out not understanding each other and gradually grow to love each other like crazy, and that to me is what i loved about Soredemo Sekai wa Utsukushii. \\n\\n\r\nI don't want to spoil it for you but if you are feeling discouraged about watching it based on its low ratings i want to encourage you to try out the first 3 episodes, you will be asking for more after you do, its better than most highly rated romantic animes on MyAnimeList, believe me i have watched them all.",

            "content": "With this anime, there were both things that I enjoyed, but there were also things that I didn't like. I rated the story as 'Fair' for a couple of reasons, mostly on the basis of my bias towards shoujo anime. I usually don't like shoujo anime and manga in its original, flowery, roses and sparkles and hot anime guys form. Although, there are, of course, exceptions. Soredemo Sekai wa Utsukushii, aka Still World is Beautiful, aka The World is Still Beautiful, is, I admit, an exception. (Toshokan Sensou is also definitely an exception...okay, so is Lovely Complex. Lovely Complex is hilarious). \r\nThe story, although amusingand depicts that there are still beautiful, pleasant things in life in the midst of all the bullshit we have to deal with as human beings, like, for example, anguish and grief and being ostracized and all the things that just aren't fair, still has the shoujo element of two characters meeting each other, not liking each other at all, and then somehow falling in love(p.s - I know this says to avoid spoilers, but it's very blatantly obvious who's going to fall in love with who. I really try to avoid spoilers). \\n\\n\r\nEven though I hardcore ship the main coupling in this anime, at the same time I coped with the whole 'tsundere-love-obvious-love-happening' thing that goes on. The story line does have a uniqueness to it that I haven't seen in other anime, which is a plus. The story is simple, however; no hardcore, complex, masterful, and well thought out plot lines and connections that exist in something like Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, Canaan, Darker Than Black, or Baccano!. It's not as plotless as something like Full Metal Panic!, however. It's just, as aforementioned, simple. Not that simple is bad. Sometimes after sapping up the intricate details that appears in anime like Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood or in shows like White Collar, I need something nice and clean cut and simple and short. Something like Soredemo Sekai wa Utsukushii, for example. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, it's also not the most realistic...well, realistic isn't the right word. Anime isn't really realistic like other types of media because of dramatic effects and whatnot that you don't notice in real life in intense situations, or aren't flared up for a dramatic effect that you can utilize in anime and other shows, movies, etc. I mean...like...accurate responses to situations and hardcore, sheer animation that properly, beautifully depicts someone shooting a gun, for example...kind of like when Re-L Mayer shot a gun in this one scene in Ergo Proxy...wragiojeijtwrj ohmygoodness the sheer amount of detail...the realism...oh yes. Shoujos aren't realistic like that. They're lighthearted and amusing. I'm usually a seinen kind of person, whose brain mentally jacks off to carefully placed details and realistic reactions to certain situations and whatnot, but regardless I was still able to enjoy this anime. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the character development, for one. I really liked the main characters. However, the two mainmainmain characters were much more fleshed out and paid attention to, overshadowing all the other less-developed characters, which I guess wasn't that hindering, but at times I wished I could have stomped into the anime and got to know the characters that I didn't get to know while watching it. \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I really liked about this anime was its emphasis on how beautiful life really is despite all of the ugly, grotesque, unpleasant chaos that's very often mixed in. One of the main characters, after experiencing one of life's not-so-pleasant things at a somewhat young age, is very cold and hardened after the fact, and there's something just so realistic about that particular character. They are human, they have good moments and equally bad, more darker moments, which I really liked while watching this. It made it easier to emphasize with them and understand why they didn't find much beauty in anything, really. I felt like I could just hop onto the bandwagon of their pain and what they've gone through and then jump off the bandwagon and understand. Also, the bond between the two main characters gradually grows stronger over the duration of the series, which was a plus. \\n\\n\r\nI liked the art style; it was pretty, but it wasn't over-the-top or generic either. It was pleasant. The sound was very impressive. One of the main themes from the anime, 'The Tender Rain', is a very beautiful song. So that gets a '10' under the sound category. \\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed watching this anime despite its drawbacks; it was very amusing, easy and fun to watch, and it wasn't hard to grasp what was going on. However, at times, the reactions of the characters and what happened was a bit too laid back and dolloped with a bit too much shoujo sparkly rosy frosting on top at times when it should have been slightly more serious because it would have made more sense, but other than that it was pretty good. I rarely got bored with this anime, which somewhat surprised me. There were a few not-too-detrimental lulls in the plot line, but it didn't make me grimace and click away from the anime. \\n\\n\r\nSo, would I recommend this anime? If you like a laid back, easy-to-understand plot and a bit of deep meaning and thought sprinkled on it, and you're willing to watch a shoujo that isn't too uncomfortably shoujo if you cringe at the term 'shoujo', then yes. This isn't exactly one of my favorite anime(Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood and Toshokan Sensou are very precious to me *u*), but it's not one of my least favorite, either. 7/10; 70%! This anime got a C. Barely passing, but it's still solid enough to enjoy. I hope you liked this review! This is my first review. Also, I don't mean to insult anyone with what they like; we all have different tastes, after all. :3",

            "content": "Soredemo Sekai wa Utsukushii. A great romance anime. This was an anime I was really looking forward to, but I waited until it finished airing. I'm just not patient enough to wait for a whole week every time after watching just one episode. Never mind, I'll start my review:\r\nStory 10/10\r\nThe story is about Nike, the fourth princess of the rain kingdom. As she lost a rock-paper-scissors match to her sisters, she has to go to the sun kingdom and marry the king. When she arrives, she finds out the king is a kid. But that apart, the king has a very closed personnality and orderspeople around. Nike, who often gets frustrated about it, tries to change him. Through the episodes, you will see how they will grow to each other, and a romance story will develop. \\n\r\nPersonnally, I thought the story was original, because I haven't really seen a story like this before. Of course, someone gets married of, but most of those story's are about a guy who is older than the main girl. And this is different in this story. \\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\r\nThe art was good, it was realistic and it fitted the characters. I liked the way everything looked, their emotions were well shown and there was also attention paid to the surroundings. I thought it was pretty well done.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\r\nI thought the voices fitted the characters very well, there were no annoying voices or sounds in this anime (thank god). I also liked the opening and ending song, as well as Nike's own song when she calls forth the rain.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10\\n\r\nBecause there are two main characters I will just talk about them:\\n\r\nNike: I already said she is the forth princess of the rain kingdom, well, if you can really call it a kingdom. But never mind that. She speaks her mind and cares a lot about others. She is also troubled by Livius' behavior and he slowly opens up to her. She is brave, and doesn't change her mind when she wants to achieve something.\\n\r\nLivius: I have no idea how old he is, but het acts like he is the same age as Nike, maybe even older. In the beginning, he is stiff, a workaholic and doesn't want ayone to say a word against him. Except from his mother, he doesn't really see anybody as his family. In the beginning, he finds Nike annoying and doesn't want her interfering with stuff. However, he gradually loosens up a bit, begins to trust Nike and wants to protect her.\\n\\n\r\nI thought both main characters where great, they stand up for themselves and for each other. They 'fight' pretty much, but that's just funny to watch. I definitely loved the way how they began to trust each other more. There relationship develops trough the episodes. Of course they have some trials to go through. It's not just an anime with a lot of happiness, then I would probably have thought it was to sweet.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nAs I think you already can see it through what I said earlier, I really enjoyed this anime. It got me addicted, so I kept watching. It has a fantasy element because Nike can do something special. Also this makes the story original. And of course, I'll say it again, I liked the romance, it was cute in it's own way. I was actually pretty glad that, even though Livius was still a boy, he didn't act like he was one. Well, he got trough a lot of grief so that made him act like that. Anyway, I enjoyed this anime really much.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\r\nYeah, I know, I know, I didn't give all the categories a 10, but still, I give the overall a 10. As someone who's fond of romance animes, I really enjoyed this anime. I had high expectations and they came true. So if you like romance animes with a small fantasy toutch, this really is an anime you should watch.\\n\\n\r\nI really hope my review helped you a bit, you should watch this anime. Don't hestitate, just watch it. That's all I can say. I loved it. I hope you will too.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Story: I can sum it up in two words: Stockholm Syndrome. That's what's going on in this anime and there isn't a more obvious example available. It isn't a true romance. The king essentially holds the girl hostage and then she gradually falls for him. She begins to see what she wants to see in him (the fact that he's emotionally damaged and needs to be loved) and soon forgets the fact that she's there against her wishes.\r\nCharacters: I'll start with Livius. He's the child of a king but since his mother was a commoner both he and his mother were treated like outcasts. Asa kid he somehow ascended the throne and became king after his mother died. He acts like a spoiled brat and nobody likes him. So how did he become king and why do people accept that he's king? If he's so hated, why hasn't anyone just killed him yet and made life better for everyone? No idea. The first questions are never really answered which bugged me. The second question isn't answered either which bugged me more. It would have been so easy to kill and replace him and nobody would have cared.\\n\\n\r\nNike is a princess from a far off kingdom that has been promised to the Sun King. She starts off as a strong willed, likable character who can be a bit stubborn at times. But over the course of the show I came to dislike her more and more. Almost certainly because she softens and somehow falls in love with her captor, the child king Livius. She has a unique ability to bring rain when she sings.\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound are both great and there isn't much to say about them. Overall I didn't enjoy the show for reasons I've given above.",

            "content": "I found this series rather uninspired. Lacking in intrigue , it tries too hard in all the wrong ways while leaving its potential strengths to languish in the derived mediocrities of the shojo genre. The plot mechanic of the age disparity between the protagonists, especially in light of their genders, was the sole unique feature that drew me to this anime (as I'm fond of unconventional romances) and partially redeems it after the fact. Perhaps I was expecting too much of this series but like an initially idealistic parent later turned sour on the realities of life; I am left simply disappointed at the wasteof potential. The suspense and drama in this series felt artificial and plainly predictable, as though they were set pieces (and not in the intriguing Machiavellian way) used to force the movement of plot or check off tropes from a list. Aside from the aforementioned plot mechanic this series was very much analogous to a stereotypical harem anime and like the rehashed harem anime, this series probably won't be well received outside its target audience aside from as a guilty pleasure. The short of it is: if you are an older veteran of anime who has a taste for the cerebral in shows or being kept on your toes as a viewer of romance/drama, then look elsewhere. If you are however a younger viewer, perhaps even a virgin to the genre, and you have a fancy for the Japanese re-imagining (i.e. stereotyping) of western high fantasy settings then this series might be for you.",

            "content": "There is something about this show that sets itself apart from other shoujo anime that have been coming out as of late. While Soredemo has its share of shoujo tropes, to me it tonally resides in a sort of genre-free zone. This series isn\u2019t a \u201ctypical\u201d shoujo fantasy or romance\u2014the genre here is simply \u201creally good\u201d. Shortly after the first episode, I found that \u2018something\u2019, it has \u2018charm\u2019. This is what has been missing in a lot of recent shoujo which enrichens the magical and alluring atmosphere of the series. Adapted from Dai Shiina's manga, \"Soredemo Sekai wa Utsukushii\" (The World is Still Beautiful), thestory follows a Princess from the Rain Principality in Nike Remercier who was pushed to have an arranged marriage to the person who conquered the world for her country, despite her unwillingness. That person is the Sun King, Livius Orvinus Ifrikia, who she later discovers is not your average King. He has a condescending attitude and not only young for his position but short in height. This is how the charming series begins, these two characters create something special that has an old-school shoujo style and feel to it. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is episodic structured though there is an overarching plot which becomes clear early on in the series. Livi has spent all his years as King in conquering the world due to unfortunate events that happened in the past that have made him grow cold and cruel, he began to distrust those around him. Nike is sent to marry Livi so her country can retain its autonomy after he demanded it. Nike who has the power to call forth the rain was the perfect settlement between the two kingdoms. After both starting off with the wrong foot, these two later develop one of the most charming and believable romances in anime. As the story progresses, Nike helps Livi as he slowly begins to realize that good still exists in this world, that it can be a beautiful place. Though only a year or two in age difference, the way the characters are designed to seem as if Nike was much older than Livi but don't let that put you off, this series proves that this can be overcome if the writing is tasteful and sensitive, and I give full credit to Shiina Dai. \\n\\n\r\nSetting aside the fact that in historical context this sort of relationship is perfectly normal, what makes it work is that the writer presents us with Livi and Nike as people, not numbers, and all a viewer has to do is look at them the same way. If there was ever a series that was made for a studio, it's Soredemo Sekai wa Utsukushii and Studio Pierrot with its old-school, fairy-tale, quasi-European look and tone. The visuals and animation are some of their best work. From the colour palette, backgrounds, landscapes and architectures, making it fit well within the fantasy themes. Character designs are creative and distinctive. Something I have found interesting was that the characters in various episodes wore different clothes ranging from formal to casual and they were well designed. Visually a spectacle reminiscent of a classic Disney film.\\n\\n\r\nThe score is perhaps one of the biggest strengths in the series. It gives off a real majestic feel, something similar to old Disney classics and really puts a mark on the themes and messages that Soredemo Sekai wa Utsukushii tries to convey to the audience. The song, \"Beautiful Rain\" (Tender Rain) by Rena Maeda who is the Voice Actress of Nike becomes a signature musical item that plays when Nike sings to call forth the rain. Her voice is sublime, as soon as the song hits the climax it tends to create a magical moment and leaves you mesmerized. The Opening song, \"Beautiful World\" by Joanna Koike instantly sets the mood, it is catchy and uplifting. The Ending song that is also done by Rena Maeda, \"Promise\" showcases her beautiful voice in a very elegant manner, it's the perfect song to end each episode on. They sure did an excellent job on the casting, again, a lot of praise to Rena Maeda on Nike's voice. It really is the heart and soul of the show, she really brings her character to life and compliments Nike's personality. Nobunaga Shimazaki had a tough task ahead of him while casting Livi's character, I thought it was an interesting choice as normally a woman would have been cast. Glad to tell you that Nobunaga Shimazaki does great, he works at capturing the dichotomy between Livi\u2019s appearance and his stature because he manages to make him vulnerable without putting on a silly attempt to sound like a child.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting characters compliment Nike and Livi greatly, especially Neil who is Livi's loyal butler and tutor who guides him through his campaign as King. His reactions to bizarre situations and silly antics that he observes or participates in are hilarious. To Highlight once again on Nike and Livi\u2019s relationship on why it\u2019s so amazing. You see two characters that deal with each other on remarkably equal terms. They\u2019re complex, strong-willed and smart people who don\u2019t want to be taken for granted.  Because of the premise\u2014Livi being young, yet a preternaturally smart and gifted Head of State\u2014you have the basis of the romance being two characters whom each want more than to be protected by the other.  It\u2019s a slyly wonderful basis for a romance story where the principals operate on equal terms, and that\u2019s exactly how it played out. Their personalities and traits clash but they make it work, there is definitely an emotional-need type connection between the two, they even look incomplete when not together.\\n\\n\r\nThe romance doesn't feel forced despite the arrangement between the two, it feels rather natural and there is a real connection between them. Take Nike's power for example. Her inspiration to calling forth the rain is by seeing the beauty in the world through the one who wishes for the rain. Livi is incapable of seeing such things at first but Nike connects with him emotionally and becomes his saviour, makes him realize how beautiful the world really is despite the trials and tribulations that life throws at you. These two have come to love and respect each other that they want to be sure the moment they choose is the right one.  They\u2019re mature enough to understand that they\u2019re still immature and have grown to love each other with patience. Thankfully, while the subject matter is taken seriously, the series itself retains a sense of light fun. The humour is multi-faceted, sometimes it's slapstick, sometimes it's a little more adult. Surprisingly, the series occasionally breaks the fourth wall, which is a delight for fans of meta-humour and this is very much created by Nike and Livi's relationship.\\n\\n\r\nSoredemo Sekai wa Utsukushii throws together a bit of everything. It's an adventure, it's a love story, there is magic, there is a monarchy, there are action sequences and comedy. The show does a careful balancing act of entertaining the audience with a bit of each, all the whilst ensuring to never take itself too seriously. There are some good suspense and a lot of heartfelt moments. There is a serenity within the series while also being fun and full of life. It's really one of the most charming series I have seen in a long time for shoujo and this was never more proudly on display than in the finale, which wore its heart on its sleeve in a way very few anime do. To put it more precisely, Soredemo Sekai wa Utsukushii is a diamond in the rough. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I really feel like this anime just has a way of getting you sucked into the story. Yes it's shoujo, yes it's romance, but it's an enchanting story being told. And it's not that typical \"oh well he's a king & I'm a princess\" *automatically falls in love* Not even close! He threw her in jail when Livi first met Nike xD It's a story that takes place in a distant era, but it's definitely not what you expect!\r\nStory: 8/10- What is to really admire about this story is that it's not that shoujo that's all about the romance and overly sweet moments. There's actions,and things you wouldn't expect a princess to ever do! It has a define plot, though it's pretty simple; but it gets it point across without being too complex. Just seeing the level of character building between the two protagonists and how they change gradually is just great. Nothing seems too sudden, but just right.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10- The art is pretty colorful. Nothing is ever bland, but just a balance of beautiful colors. The animation overall is very nice and neat. But it's nothing over-the-top. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10- The music for this anime is hands down perfect. Maeda Rena's voice is beautiful. She's the voice actor for Nike & the singer for the opening, closing, and of course the \"Tender Rain\" song! The lyrics for the songs themselves are in sync for the overall anime. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10- It's not common when I find an anime with nice development without over doing it or not enough. The main characters are a winner in this. Livi's past isn't fully exposed to the point where you know EVERYTHING, but just enough were us as the viewer is satisfied. Nike's past is  also like this. But since we meet her family later in the series, hers is more developed in a way. Overall, all the supporting characters are nicely done and aren't a nuisance ^^ But even with that, there are still some questions you might be asking yourself by the last few moments of episode 12 ;)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10- From episode one to now, I have loved every minute. Maybe it's because I am a sucker for romance, or maybe it's because this anime is a refresher. A lot of anime nowadays is becoming redundant and isn't as unique. But this anime hits home of being a new eye opener. Even with the plot being nothing completely special, just the characters themselves are enjoyable & the music. Music in this anime doesn't go wrong, at all!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10- Loved it! And I recommend this anime is anyone. :3",

Several authors write the story by giving the sweetest moment between the couple that exist in the story. And now, Soredemo Sekai wa Utsukushii continue the legacy of that classic era. Well, if you look deeply inside the plot, Soredemo Sekai Wa Utsukushi have the same typical romance comedy plot, but it's capable to represents the main feeling of the story itself. Soredemo succeed brings all the emotion on the screen, it has great plot although not the greatestplot that ever exist.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation of Soredemo Sekai wa Utsukushii is clear and neat. It has well-produced  backgrounds, and visual effects. The eye maybe a little bit different from the manga series, but it's fine though since the animation is neat.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the sound, Soredemo have  decent sound settings. The opening \"Beautiful World\" is matched with the entire series, while the ending \"Promise\" sung by Rena Maeda (The seiyuu of Nike) is more forgotten when compared with the opening song. The voice actors did decent jobs while bringing such character to the screen.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character in Soredemo Sekai wa Utsukushii is not flat, they classified in a beautiful way. There are developments between the main characters, as the story running, they learn each other past, and with that past, they can create a beautiful relationship. The other characters besides the main character is a bit flat, there has to be an explanation for this.\\n\\n\r\nSometimes exciting, sometimes not...., Soredemo has a see-saw enjoyment, I found my brain hard to deciding when I stop or when I continue to watch the series. The main enjoyment is at the edge of the story or should I say the climax. But in general, it entertains me...\\n\\n\r\nIt is recommended for the fans of Shoujo genres. Since it's a shoujo, male viewers maybe not recommended to watch this anime, some of them may found this boring. My passion in this anime is an adaptation of a second season..., well just hope that happen   \\n",

            "content": "Does rock-paper-scissors determine the fate of everything? Not really but for Nike Lemercier, the fourth and youngest princess of Rain Dukedom, she\u2019s about to find out just how much her life will change with just a game. Despite her reluctance, she is to marry the Sun King Livius, not for an everlasting relationship but for her country\u2019s sake. Facing the problem of annexation, she travels to the Sun Kingdom for a marriage, one she thought was never meant to be. And boy, was she wrong.\r\nFirst thought regarding the series primarily deals with its adaptation. The anime covers roughly 18 chapters of the fantasy shoujo manga,written by Dai Shiina. The author\u2019s expertise in the field of shoujo has earned her the 34th Hakusensha Athena grand prize in 2009. Now her current work Soredemo Sekai Wa Utsukushii (This World is Still Beautiful) is a centerpiece to her ideas. Crafted by classic shoujo themes in a fantasy setting, the series tells about a very oddball duo \u2013 a young princess and a king of a kingdom. \\n\\n\r\nDespite the show displaying some crass and generic concepts, it is surprisingly light on its feet. The show takes the direction of a fantasy shoujo and transcends it into an elevated atmosphere of energy with its characters. As the king of Sun Kingdom, Livius Orvinus Ifrikia (better known as Livius) is one such character with a huge prowess despite his age and appearance. From what we know, he was able to conquer the world, rid of government corruption, and seize power through conquest in a short span of just three years. But for someone his size and age, it\u2019s hardly believable at first. That is, until we find out more about his inner character. That\u2019s where Nike comes in who brings the best out of him. For starters though, Nike herself is shown to be a curious girl. Her journey to the Sun Kingdom ends up her losing her luggage, getting almost mugged, and treated with dismay by some of the commoners there. Rather than going vengeful at her condition however, Nike displays a more responsible personality when she is helps out some folks out of her kind heart. And from there on, it\u2019s easy to realize that Nike is a selfless girl, one with philanthropic traits and puts others above herself. It\u2019s from these traits that we see a different side between her and Livius as a couple.\\n\\n\r\nMuch to Nike\u2019s shock and perhaps some of the audience as well, Livius\u2019 appearance is not much different than those of a child. Standing perhaps at only 5 feet, he is a character who has accomplished unbelievable tasks. We also learn that Livius, as a person, wasn\u2019t always born like this. Through the resourceful flashbacks inserted into the series, it\u2019s shown that Livius\u2019 life wasn\u2019t always as glamourous as his current self. While his father is a king, Livius\u2019 mother is no more than a commoner. And after her death, it seems to awoken something inside of the child. As for that moment, his desire to set about a new world order comes to fruition. Throughout the series, Livius displays leadership traits and rules his kingdom with an iron fist. Although not necessarily violent or power hungry, he has a commanding presence with an ability to lead. Perhaps this could also be a fa\u00e7ade though. One could interpret that his ambition to conquer the world is for her mother\u2019s sake or rather for forget about his past and painful memories. Because whenever he thinks of his mother, she really would be dead in his thoughts. Thankfully, we have Nike who plays a princess, savior, and wife all the same time for this young boy.\\n\\n\r\nTaken for granted, there\u2019s much capability between Nike and Livius. They came from different backgrounds, vastly contrasting personalities, and appearance wise makes the duo look like they came from different planets. Although this isn\u2019t initially a good set up for partners, the two progresses throughout the series. They risk lives for each other and develops an attachment that goes from marriage to lovers. In essence, Nike is the light that shines upon Livius\u2019 darkened heart. It\u2019s shown in the series that Livius\u2019 personality can contrast vastly depend on various circumstances. In one instance, he becomes so jealous and angry that an order to send his own uncle to prison simply for a misunderstanding was issued. His actions could be interpreted as those of a child in this way; almost like a metaphor like a toy being taken away from him. But that\u2019s not entirely true at all, because Livius doesn\u2019t treat Nike like a toy. As the series progresses, he shows different sides of him as a person rather than a king and even develops feelings for the princess. In respect, Nike also seemingly holds similar feelings that connects the duo through their very unusual bonding. It\u2019s a fantasy story of two people coming together in all the unbelievable ways. Nike\u2019s ability to summon rain is just one such astonishing way, a technique that even make Livius in awe. \\n\\n\r\nAs their relationship progresses, there are also obstacles whether it\u2019s characters such as Livius\u2019 fianc\u00e9 Luna and Uncle, Nike\u2019s side of her family, or just being with someone with the status of a king itself. The way the show takes direction shows how strong their connection becomes on various circumstances. And responding to these circumstances become pivotal to create a dynamic atmosphere for their relationship. In retrospect, the show crafts this concept with clever development. Although it has clich\u00e9 ideas, the show portrays it as honest and charming. It\u2019s also delightful to see how the King progresses not as a ruler, but as a person doing normal things thanks to Nike. In fact, Nike display the anti-thesis of a spoiled princess. She is able selfless and kind at heart. Their constant bickering can be interpreted as amusing as they learn what it really means to be \u2018engaged\u2019. Such a simple term mean a lot in this this show for it brings out the best out of both of these characters in the end. Don\u2019t believe me? Try laying even a finger on Nike and you\u2019ll feel the wrath of a very pissed off king.\\n\\n\r\nThe show has its side of humor that is displayed with tricky bits of execution. For one, the relationship between Nike and Livius can seem a bit substantial given their contrasting appearances. It can give the audience a wrong impression with their appearances as husband and wife in a bedroom. But rather than seeing them from an inappropriate angle, it\u2019s more thoughtful to view the duo as a pair with much more to learn. What we also get from the show is also the amount of energy both appealing and emotional. For the appealing side, there\u2019s the delightful moments between Nike and Livius. The emotional aspects flirts with human nature and instinct such as insecurity, jealousy, and pride. These aren\u2019t just bestowed upon our lovable duo but to other characters such as Livius\u2019 personal butler Neil. His overprotectiveness can be borderline out of control. For Nike\u2019s side, the higher ups in her family has plans of their own to keep Nike as \u201ctheirs\u201d. Onto a more childish angle, we also get the oldest trick in the book \u2013 childhood crushes. Do understand that the show does also appeal to its more dramatic side. Like mentioned before, the show\u2019s flashbacks aren\u2019t just for show-and-tell but rather as a way to dissect piece by piece of the characters\u2019 image. We learn a lot from childhood pasts especially for Livius that we can also feel pity for.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork is bright and colorful with Studio Pierrot in charge. Known for their habits for adding anime original content (as seen from the first half of the pilot episode), there\u2019s an incentive to make this show\u2019s visuals look credible. And thankfully, I\u2019d say they pulled it out beautifully. As the title \u201cThis World is Still Beautiful\u201d, the show\u2019s animation quality is exactly that. The Sun Kingdom has lavish landscapes, natural features, and the castle that Livius resides shows his testimony in power. Character designs are also creative with decorative clothing that characters wear on traditions. Other characters also display credible appearances whether they are soldiers, maids, or even a prime minister. Perhaps the one character that contradict such credibility would be the king himself with his appearance. \\n\\n\r\nWhile soundtrack doesn\u2019t score the home run for the series, its message does. While the main OP song has a smooth pacing and coordination, it\u2019s the theme song in the show that truly counts. Nike\u2019s singing is an embodiment for symbolizing hope and rebirth. The song \u201cTender Rain\u201d is a prominent feature throughout the series that is much more than just simple water pouring down on earth. It acts as a symbolic way for Livius\u2019 progress as a character with him undergoing changes. The song itself is also sung with energy and empowerment as Nike\u2019s voice really means it for every word. Otherwise, the OST of the show balances itself well along with characters\u2019 voice mannerisms. \\n\\n\r\nSurprise is a word I would describe my feelings towards this show. What is seemingly a clich\u00e9 shoujo here is presented with an attractive appeal for its setting, characters, and ideas. Its balance of the show\u2019s story and comedy matches well. It\u2019s insightful to see how much Livius change especially after getting acquainted with Nike. And while the story is predictable with cheesy lines and moments, it\u2019s also honest and innocent. For a story to be bought out this way, it\u2019s also definitely beautiful.\\n",

            "content": "With the glaring number of praising reviews, and a decent enough of the overall, I had thought to find at least something that would temporarily be a time-killer of sorts. Unfortunately, what I found was a show riddled with problems, unbearable story and poor characters. Throughout the entire show, the only thing that stuck out was production value - something that matters the least in the show of this genre. \r\nWhat Soredemo Sekai wa Utsukushii has is not a story - it's rather an abomination, shrouded in overlapping layers of discomfort, insanity and terrible writing. Story is crippled by its inability to stay consistent, subtleor thought-provoking in any kind of a manner. By the time the torture was finally over, I could do nothing but laugh at how terrible it was. You can go as far as calling it a disgrace to the world of literature if you will ... and you wouldn't be far off. So, what's wrong with it, you wonder? \\n\\n\r\nThe premise in itself is not bad, and the first episode does, somewhat, provide a hook onto the show. However, it already began showcasing the major problems the story has - the writer had absolutely zero idea what the hell he/she wanted to do with it. Plot-hole galore is already present by the time you've watched half of the anime, and you can't help but wonder did anyone even have a grasp of what was supposed to be happening within the world created. If you're looking for a political warfare - forget it. If you're looking for economic discussion of kingdoms - forget it. If you're looking for wars - forget it. If you're looking for struggle to reign over kingdom - forget it. If you're looking for romance - forget it. This story doesn't offer any of those in the slightest measure of what should be considered acceptable. Ranging from the actions of characters that are just completely random, to the drama that's so forced you just cringe, to the sob-filled flashbacks that only add more confusion to what already is \"why and how and what\" type of a show. I won't go into much detail, but here's one: in the first episode, it's showcased that Nike is unable to use her powers while hungry. While it was done in a comical way, it still set a standard of rule within the world. Suffice to say, you can forget it. Furthermore, she made a big fuss about making rain, but each time she summons it, she's singing THE EXACT SAME SONG. The rules this world sets are ignored on every single corner. Furthermore, in the later episodes, the guards / soldiers / servants / king / everyone, let the princess partake in an event that could potentially lead to her death. No. Just, no. \\n\\n\r\nThen, we get the introduction of \"villains\". It even pains me to call them so. Their motives and reasoning are pathetic, and even more insulting is that they give up on them so quickly it feels as if it was pointless to have them to begin with. For instance, bad guy number one, was against the marriage because he felt the rain to be bad omen to the Kingdom of Sun. He even went as far as to try and assassinate the princess. Minutes come and go, rain, viola, refreshing, I approve. I won't go into more details for fear of spoiling it (to be honest, there isn't much to spoil so ... ah, well), but, rest assured, that if you're looking for a story, stay as far away as possibly can.\\n\\n\r\nSome may argue that this wasn't supposed to be a story-driven series, and that characters carry it (I'll come to them), but if you bother trying to put a front of the story, at least make sure that front doesn't fall apart before story even begins. The author clearly abandons the rules he/she set, and uses things on convenience of the characters, essentially nullifying any possible conflict that would arise, rendering it pointless in a nutshell. \\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned beforehand, the only thing worth a damn in this show is the production. I enjoyed character designs, the way they did rain on certain occasions, as well as more than a few background shots. Animation, on the other hand, is ... average at best. It does its job, but the factor of excitement is nowhere to be found, since nothing about animation excited me in this show. From the information I've gathered, another thing that's simply worth of another \"what?\" is that Nike is 17 years old while the King is 15 years old. Why is there such a difference in height between the two of them I cannot answer. This also ties in to the story - is someone who's 17 really that much more of an \"adult\" than someone who's 15? \\n\r\nOn the sound side, there were more than a few pieces I enjoyed, but I really hated the repetitive \"call down the rain\" song - it wasn't even that good to begin with. You'll be skipping both OP and ED one episode in, so don't even bother. \\n\\n\r\nNow, as far as the characters go, they aren't as terrible as the story, but they're still quite dreadful. The biggest complaint I've got is the inconsistency and the backtrack of development, or rather the sudden development. Nike is referred to as a tomboy, but as far as I'm concerned, she's a bad example of one. She's rash, at times brainless and flat out ignorant, and, while you may say it's part of her charm, I'll say it's part of why she's a terrible character. She hauls the same mistakes over and over again, seemingly, again, abandoning the principle of \"follow what you set, goddamnit\". For a breakdown: in one of the scenes, she wakes up next to the King, and she isn't embarrassed at all. Same thing happens the next time, she is. She gets pettily jealous when someone showcases affection for the King, but is a complete, brainless moron when it's the other way around. The fact that this show even mustered courage to say that she had charmed the Kingdom into her liking is just impossible. To begin with, I have no idea how she even charmed the King.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the King, his name is Livius, or Livi for short. He's introduced as heartless and lacking in compassion - by that introduction, he should have had Nike beheaded in the very first episode. But that's just a nitpick. His character takes turns in every episode, round and round, like an never-ending roller-coaster. He first lacks love, then he doesn't, then he suddenly does again, and so on and so forth. Honestly, with the way he is, the idea of him \"conquering the world\" is not just unfathomable - it's impossible. I'd rather live alone in the desert than have him act as my king. You can attribute that to the age, sure, but how was he able to conquer the world then? No, he wasn't. He acts more like a spoiled prince rather than the King, even before Nike \"changed him\". I won't dwell into much detail (for fear of spoiling, again, I guess ...), but rest assured that neither the characters nor the story can salvage somewhat above average production. \\n\\n\r\nThe only other character that's worth a damn in this show is the butler, but he's mostly just a comedic relief. Other characters are there when it's convenient or when the \"conflict\" is required. The only and only way this \"story\" progresses is when a random character, unheard of before, is introduced and our heroes must find a way to overcome the obstacle. The. Only. Way. Think about it for a moment. \\n\\n\r\nDid I enjoy SSwU? Nope. Aside from a few funny moments, this one's nothing but the soup whose main ingredient, the characters, are terrible, coupled with even worse story, and a decent production to cheat you off the foul taste. The \"resolutions\" of \"conflicts\" aren't satisfactory, the \"conflicts\" themselves are just nonsensical and boring, the writing is often so over-the-top it crosses the \"cringe-worthy\" barricade, and a few laughs that you can get from it won't satisfy you in the tiniest bit. \\n\\n\r\nDo I recommend it? If you can stuff through 12 episodes of terrible writing, just to get the predictable ending you saw coming first episode in, sure. IF you can stuff through 12 episodes of nothing but random conflicts (and I mean, NOTHING else), that somehow \"develop\" our characters, be my guest. If you can do all those things and more, and after finishing it can still say \"Yeah, I enjoyed that\", I commend you. You are bigger man than I am.",

            "content": "What does this anime remind me of? Ans, \"The King and I\" yes a classic 1956 movie (with its 1999 re-make) that you're great grandma has probably watched when she was younger and re-watch several times in some of those classic channels.......that is, if they have access to 'Turner Classics\" or \"MGM Classic, \" hey, let's face it, it was almost identical  to the classic where the king is a cold and uptight ruler and the girl is an independent outspoken individual, even thought there is that reverse thing, where in the classic it a east meets west kind of thing, here it wasmore of a west meets east and also it has the element from beauty and the beast where beauty was force stay with the beast, while in this anime  in was more of a reverse lolicon  or more like a sotacon where beauty ( I'm guessing she's somewhere between 18-21) was forced to become this kiddo's (I'm also guessing that he is somewhere between 11-13 years old) bride ( or maybe his playmate) but either way the romance and adventure really did play well or at least plotwise, so here are my ratings for this anime:\\n\\n\r\nStory: Outstanding 10.\\n\\n\r\nRefer to the explanation above. Take note the score is only for the plot where it does have some similarities with the classic movie. \\n\\n\r\nArt: Good 7.\\n\\n\r\nI like the way Nike is illustrated, though she more of a sexier version of Anna Harriette Leonowens. Also, I kinda like the Chinese Tibetan motif that were featured in the last 3 episode of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Poor 3.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I may have liked the opening theme, and Nike's song \"Tender Rain\" but for the song \"Tender Rain\", well it was touching at first, but it becomes annoying later on. Also, Livi's voice would have been better of if it was continuously  done by seiyuu Kudou, Haruka, instead of Shimazaki, Nobunaga, because an early teen's voice doesn't matured up until he is 14 years of age and frankly Livi doesn't look like he is 14. Nike's voice on the other hand should have that tsundere tone co'z quite frankly Maeda Rena's tone wasn't tsundere enough, also, I can't understand why Nike's grandma's farewell rain was done by a younger girl, it would have been more appropriate  if  Granny's farewell rain song was done by an opera singer, so its either studio Pierrot and VAP were cutting cost or Japan doesn't have any local opera singers. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Dreadful 2.\\n\\n\r\nThis is the part were I would ask......as to WTF was series creator  Shiina, Dai thinking for conceptualizing such thought about a grown up being in a relationship with a kid? Such character concept of this series' creator was enough of me to give this category a low score, let's go over the main character's\\n\\n\r\nNike Remercier- Ok, I have no problems of her marry off to a person of nobility, but my peeves about her stems from the fact that she is a person of nobility who happens to be rough around the edges, now to  me I see it as a good thing where it shows humility, what I don't like was that her suppose husband is a brat and she doesn't do anything to get away from him, in fact whatever bet she had with her sisters can be declared as null and void. Now the conflict here was how does she sees Livi, does she see him as a poor soul that she took upon herself to comfort him or has she already develop that lolicon thing for him?\\n\\n\r\nLivius Orvinus- He is another reason why I give this category a low score, I just couldn't fathom as to why a boy like him would go for a MILF like Nike, when he could have just went looking for Amaluna, also WTF was series creator  Shiina, Dai thinking for letting a kid do a man's job. Frankly, I kinda see him as a kid entering puberty and probably he can see Nike naked and do get punish and I'm thinking that he gets to  loose his virginity to her as well.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Fair 6.\\n\\n\r\nMainly, there were Episodes that I find entertain and there are those that were a drag and that's the reason why I give this category its score.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Decent 4.\\n\\n\r\nThe story plot may be good, but the real let down was the fact that this anime has that reverse lolicon thingy, but then again it was decent enough to be view by everybody, except if kids would be watching this then their parent are gonna have a lengthy explanation about the cougar and tadpole relationship.   \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "This is one of the best shoujos I've watched so far. It stands out with it's unusual setting, great and not clich\u00e9 at all characters and the great music.\r\nStory:\r\nIt was pretty original. I like the world the author created, although I couldn't understand everything about it. The story was a bit too fast paced for my taste in the first half, but it got more well balanced towards the end. It felt a bit over dramatic to me at some parts, maybe because twelve episodes are not enough to really get into the story and feel moved by the drama. I did feeled pretty movedin the last 2-3 episodes though.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art was nothing outstanding, but it wasn't bad either. I liked the way the eyes were drawned.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThis was my favourite part of this anime. The music is great. I really like the rain summoning song, it's so touching and I can never get enough of it. The opening was pretty nice too and the ending was great. The voice acting was really good too. I liked how Princess Nike didn't have a over high pitched voice like most girls in anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe two main characters were really well developed. We got to learn about their past and how they became the way they were. The way their relationship developped was really nice too, it felt realistic. Most supporting characters like the butler didn't get much development, but they were funny and interesting. Some of them could have been removed without changind anything, like the elder trio (I never understood what their role in this story was).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI really liked this anime, the first episode really got me hooked and I enjoyed most episodes a lot.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nIt is a great shoujo and I don't get why it isn't more popular. I really liked the older woman with younger man (or child here) kind of relationship. It's so unusual but worked great here. A must watch for fans of romance that are getting tired of the typical shoujos with shy girls and strong boys.",

I will try my best to ignore the story  as much as possible, so it won't ruin the fun for you.\r\n~ I never felt this good watching a shoujo anime since lovely complex.Its literally a lot similar to lovely complex too because of the height difference between the main couple and humor, what surprised me the most the animation is done by \"Studio Pierrot\", YEA YOU HEARDME RIGHT \"Studio Pierrot\" which is responsible for naruto's artwork. It has total 12 episodes, Each episode is interesting and as it starts strong and going on steadily charming,it also ended in a in a wonderful way. I feel sad for not watching this gem last year,considering the fact I am a huge shoujo fan!\\n\\n\r\nGenres-Adventure, Fantasy, Romance, Shoujo, Psychological,Comedy\\n\\n\r\nPlot- 10/10 ( No annoying love triangle, MC with a tragic past. I won't spoil anything more, just this if you are looking for lovey dovey romance and Psychological as addon to spice up things a bit, then you came to the perfect place.)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- 9/10 (Aside from main couple, side characters don't get much development, but its okay from the start you will be hooked up with Livius and its dark myster past though it remains mystery most of it because the manga itself ain't far ahead)\\n\\n\r\nArtwork- 9.5/10 (Its really rare for a shoujo adaption to have an epic artwork, not sure how many of you readers knows about this, but most of time Shoujo anime are given low budget artwork. Fortunately its adapted by a shounen studio)\\n\\n\r\nSound- 9/10 (Nike's song in the anime {It's a tender rain} is beautiful. One more thing I must tell, you must not skip the opening song as the character builds up in the opening episode after episode, it feels great to see that)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- I gave it 9 because by the end there are still some questions that left unanswered, but definitelty has high re-watch value for me!",

            "content": "I was hesitant to watch this anime, given the synopsis explained led me to believe it would be a lighthearted comedy, a genre to which I am not particularly partial.  I put off watching it for quite some time, until I had caught up with all the currently airing anime I'd been interested in, and in my idleness, I decided to watch it.  \r\nI marathon-ed this anime in two days.\r\nThe story was not the most colorful or elaborate, but it was rich in culture and backstory.  I must say, if you are a sucker for backstory, it shall be sated here, ratherthan left out to wither away in the recesses of space and time, like so many other anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe art, while well above average, fell short of remarkable.  It made the anime much more visually appealing than I was expecting, and despite the \"bishounen\" vibe throughout, the characters were not overly flowery and obnoxious in that regard.  The environment was done beautifully, with especial care given to the sky and to the castle art.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound in this anime was quite nice.  I would say it was not necessarily unique or remarkable in the everyday moments, but the anime focuses a lot around the heroine's singing, which is done in such a way the viewer enjoys it more each time, rather than a taxing noise to fast forward through as the producers provide tiring filler content.\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters were enticing and colourful, providing a refreshing reprieve from the blase stereotypes of females who are over sensitive and never forgive, and males who are either too brutal or too soft.  The heroine is strong, but nothing superhuman, and the male character is emotionally realistic to the experiences he owns.  I would say my only desire would have been for the secondary characters to be a bit less flat.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime carries a dark and flavorful theme throughout, and I would recommend it to everyone.",

            "content": "There goes another anime that I've really enjoyed. I felt like its been ages since I had another one that really can suck up my time with. I've literally finished the whole series without stopping. I don't usually write reviews , but I just had to write this one.\r\nWhat's more , it is a Shoujo Anime where you expect a handsome prince pops out fells in love at first sight to a not famous princess . Well no. A Shoujo, but not the typical ones. \r\nSoredemo Sekai wa Utsukushii (The World is Still Beautiful) really caught my attention after watching the 1st episode. Not justthe 1st, each of the episodes just had its way to make you continue watching . I tend to get very excited when each episode have its climax. Guess what? Every single episode has achieved that. To me, a good anime means craving for the next episode and the other.\\n\\n\r\nStory + Character 9/10 - Since this anime contains fantasy with anime logic. I'll go with the flow and not to mix whats real and whats not. As how the story flows , I fell in love with both the MCs. It is beautiful looking how these two progress after each episode. Its amazing that the story understand's a viewer mind. They make it in a way, that all viewers would want. Simply amazing.  \\n\\n\r\nArt + Sound 8/10 - Coming from a 2014 Anime, Art was good. Ah yes, the openings, endings, the song that the Female MC sung. - Tender Rain. Everything just fits . Listening twice is more than enough to love the song. I also love how the Female MC sang the song - tender rain. Judging from her character , don't you think it fits just fine? Gave an 8 , as you might realize the song 'tender rain' has been used quite often at the start of the first few episodes. But later that, the mood was spot on, just right . Instead, you wont get tired listening it over again. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10 - Not much to say here, I've clearly enjoyed myself after watching this anime. You can tell that everything was planned perfectly to make such a good romance story. Good way to attract a viewer's mind. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 9.5/10 - I don't see why such Romance/Shoujo Anime like this , is not well known. You may consider this as a typical Shoujo Anime since this is kind of romance that most people wants. All I can say that this anime is more than a level higher than average. Definitely one of the best shoujos animes out there. You will definitely like this.  \\n\\n\r\nThis is all based on my own opinion . No hard feelings . Any feedbacks is appreciated .\\n",

The leading characters of this anime are outstanding, I could not help to love that sassy young king, and I love an outgoing female like Nike. \r\nDont let the factthat the king is a \"kid\" scare you from watching this anime, he is probably my favorite male protagonist (of romance anime) ever, you can bear in mind that he is about 2-3 year younger than Nike, the female protagonist, so the age difference is not that big anyway \\n\\n\r\nThere is a uniqueness to this anime, I loved the sory and the art, it is fitting, and the music is really bringing it all together, I really enjoyed watching it, and that is why this anime receives a strong 10 from me.\\n\\n\r\nWARNING! This is an anime that gets you so hooked that you will watch all the episodes in one day. Haha :D",

All you think at the end is \"I want more\" and \"I need to read the manga now!!!\" This is by far my number one anime of the year. Everything about the anime is astonishing and beautiful. When I mean beautiful I mean beautiful.\r\nStory: Everything about the story had a cause and an effect. They had moments where love, had, sadness come into play. You can tell that each and every scene in the story would touch your heart in a second. It was fun and hilarious.Everything was well put together. The idea of a saddened child sun king falling in love with a princess from the rain is so cute and so well developed. You can tell that they start gradually have feelings for each other. Also when the princess can't stop falling in love with him and keeps thinking about him makes me want to scream with delight. It will satisfy you, trust me.\\n\\n\r\nArt: When I looked at the art the first time, all I could think was how beautifully all the characters were made. They each had their own personality which matched how they looked like. The flowers, trees, rain had their own little sparkle in them and it was overly perfect. It was brightly colorful and when the characters have their own little emotion fit it was cute and funny.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The singing was amazing! I could never stop listening to it to the fact where I downloaded the song to my I-pad, computer, and CD. The opening song was fun and light. The character's voices didn't have any flaws and matched the mouth movements which some animes lack. I couldn't ask for a more beautiful sound than this.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Livi and Nike are my most favorite anime characters in the whole world. They were fun and loving. They had a spark to them that most animes don't contain. The side characters has their own story behind them which makes the anime more interesting. Everyone was so enjoyable and I couldn't get enough.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I love love love it! Like I said it was fun, sad, funny, and every other emotion you can think of that'll fit this anime. I could never ask for less. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: I mean of course i'll give it a 10! Why wouldn't I? It was a truly amazing anime to watch and I enjoyed every second of it. I'm not just saying it, I literally mean it and I recommend this anime to you and your friends. It's truly amazing and at the end you want more of it!",

            "content": "The World Is Still Beautiful is a shoujo fantasy romantic comedy-drama set within a fictional land where a princess of the Rain Dukedom named Nike is arranged to be married to the Sun Kingdom's young ruler Livius in order for the Rain Dukedom to maintain its sovereignty. The series is mainly focused on the growing bond between Nike and Livius, exploring Livius' traumatic past and exploring the political hostilities that erupt among both factions in response to the marriage.\r\nThe biggest strengths to this series come in the nice amount of exploration it offers up to with Nike and Livius' lives. In spite of its 12episode run, the series explores the types of rule that both the Rain Dukedom and Sun Kingdom fall under, characters within the series with varying levels of relationship to our two leads and hostilities with both sides that involve the marriage with our leads. Beyond a few shallow characters connected to the Sun Kingdom, many relevant characters within the series get enough fleshing out for you to understand their personal beliefs, connection to our leads and what desires they have for their marriage thus there isn't much in the way of black-and-white morality to this series except for the early episode arc of Nike trying to get her marriage to Livius approved by a crooked Sun Kingdom priest. The arc where Livius and Nike visit the Rain Dukedom offers the best developments in the series for me thanks to the credible and relatable concerns that members of Nike's family have with the marriage that lead them to cause the arc's main conflict in regard to Nike's power to manipulate rain.\\n\\n\r\nOur main leads also get their developments as well with fleshing out of their characters and the gradual development of their relationship. Due to Livi's tragic past, he developed a cold outlook on life and found it difficult to trust others. The presence of Nike in his life leads our king to mellow out of his cynical mentality as he comes to gradually open up to her and settle hostilities he had with close acquaintances while still maintaining his cold facade. While \"opposites attract\" style romances are nothing new in anime, the one between Livius and Nike is a convincing one thanks to the two coming to understand and trust in one another throughout the show's run. Only low points with the storytelling are some hit and miss efforts with comedy coming from spats that our two leads get into and some unexplored elements of the series when one of Nike's family members voiced their concerns about the potential abuse that could arise with Nike's power.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, the series is on the average side for a 2014 title. There is a good amount of detail and color shading put into scenery and character designs, but it is nowhere as rich and vast in detail as what titles like Nagi no Asukara and Terror in Resonance delivered that year. The animation is also a bit on the average end as well as there are noticeable shortcuts that are taken and the only notable high points with it came from Nike's use of her power to create rain.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, The World is Still Beautiful offers an excellent exploration of the developments of Nike and Livius' relationship, as well as focusing on how others connected to them are affected by the relationship. If you're a fan of shoujo anime, this is one of the more better recent offerings for the demographic worth checking out.",

            "content": "This is my first review, so bear with me if it's bad, or doesn't make sense. To be honest, I was really surprised with this show. I haven't watched a lot of shoujo, but from the ones I watched, they were all really cliche, having a strong male and an innocent female as the protagonists, such as Kimi Ni Todoke. Before I started watching this, I had expected it to be the same, but I found out that wasn't the case.\r\nStory- I thought the plot was great. Compared to other shoujo's, this has one of the most original story lines I have seen. It's notcliche in any way, and it's not too simple or too complex to where the viewer is bored or confused with what's going on. I felt as if some scenes were over-dramatic, more than they needed to be, but I didn't really feel as if it took away from the overall enjoyment of the show. And it's not all focused on lovey-dovey scenes, there is small bit of action, and comedy scenes, all balanced together keeps the story interesting.\\n\\n\r\nArt- The art/animation was well done. Colors and backgrounds popped out, and it was consistent throughout the show. Not the best, but I didn't find anything particularly wrong with it. \\n\\n\r\nSound- The music was amazing. The OP and ED were very enjoyable to listen to, and the rain song was beautiful and touching. The BGM's were placed in the right scenes, and it made the show more enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- I love the characters of this show. They are all interesting in their own way, and I didn't find myself hating any of the characters. Nike is a strong female lead, having more of a tom-boy personality than what you would see in a normal Shoujo, but she does have a girly side as well. Livius is a strong male lead, perfect for Nike. Despite his age, he is very mature tough, but he does have his weaknesses as well. As the story progresses, you get to learn more about them as characters and their past experiences, and see them change throughout the show. You also get to see how their relationship changes, their love for each other slowly blossom. Neil was more of a side character, but he added a bit of comedy and humor to show. There are more characters, such as the three old men, but this covers it for the main.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- Overall, I really enjoyed this show. Starting from episode one, I was hooked, each episode kept making me want to watch more. Does well in every aspect, and I'm surprised this wasn't more popular. If your a fan of romance like me, or just looking for good anime show to watch, then this is worth checking out. Of course, everyone had their own opinions, but I was quite satisfied with this show. Second season?\\n\\n",

It is still a puzzle why this anime has such low ratings because if anything Soredemo Sekai wa Utsukushii deserves a higher rating than it is getting.\r\nHaving had Soredemo Sekai wa Utsukushii on my system for up to a year, i finally decided to give it a watch, i initially went into it with the assumption it would be another clich\u00e9 filled garbage of an anime, but after watching the first episode i felt compelled to watch the next episode because something about it looked promising, afterwatching the second episode i just knew i would totally love this anime, \"This\"  i said to myself \"Is what i have been searching for in a romantic anime\", after finishing i came online looking for a second season, an OVA or a movie but unfortunately there was none, so here i am writing a review.\\n\\n\r\nThe story, although unique, is quite simple, what really made this a great watch was the natural development between the characters, they start out not understanding each other and gradually grow to love each other like crazy, and that to me is what i loved about Soredemo Sekai wa Utsukushii. \\n\\n\r\nI don't want to spoil it for you but if you are feeling discouraged about watching it based on its low ratings i want to encourage you to try out the first 3 episodes, you will be asking for more after you do, its better than most highly rated romantic animes on MyAnimeList, believe me i have watched them all.",

            "content": "With this anime, there were both things that I enjoyed, but there were also things that I didn't like. I rated the story as 'Fair' for a couple of reasons, mostly on the basis of my bias towards shoujo anime. I usually don't like shoujo anime and manga in its original, flowery, roses and sparkles and hot anime guys form. Although, there are, of course, exceptions. Soredemo Sekai wa Utsukushii, aka Still World is Beautiful, aka The World is Still Beautiful, is, I admit, an exception. (Toshokan Sensou is also definitely an exception...okay, so is Lovely Complex. Lovely Complex is hilarious). \r\nThe story, although amusingand depicts that there are still beautiful, pleasant things in life in the midst of all the bullshit we have to deal with as human beings, like, for example, anguish and grief and being ostracized and all the things that just aren't fair, still has the shoujo element of two characters meeting each other, not liking each other at all, and then somehow falling in love(p.s - I know this says to avoid spoilers, but it's very blatantly obvious who's going to fall in love with who. I really try to avoid spoilers). \\n\\n\r\nEven though I hardcore ship the main coupling in this anime, at the same time I coped with the whole 'tsundere-love-obvious-love-happening' thing that goes on. The story line does have a uniqueness to it that I haven't seen in other anime, which is a plus. The story is simple, however; no hardcore, complex, masterful, and well thought out plot lines and connections that exist in something like Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, Canaan, Darker Than Black, or Baccano!. It's not as plotless as something like Full Metal Panic!, however. It's just, as aforementioned, simple. Not that simple is bad. Sometimes after sapping up the intricate details that appears in anime like Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood or in shows like White Collar, I need something nice and clean cut and simple and short. Something like Soredemo Sekai wa Utsukushii, for example. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, it's also not the most realistic...well, realistic isn't the right word. Anime isn't really realistic like other types of media because of dramatic effects and whatnot that you don't notice in real life in intense situations, or aren't flared up for a dramatic effect that you can utilize in anime and other shows, movies, etc. I mean...like...accurate responses to situations and hardcore, sheer animation that properly, beautifully depicts someone shooting a gun, for example...kind of like when Re-L Mayer shot a gun in this one scene in Ergo Proxy...wragiojeijtwrj ohmygoodness the sheer amount of detail...the realism...oh yes. Shoujos aren't realistic like that. They're lighthearted and amusing. I'm usually a seinen kind of person, whose brain mentally jacks off to carefully placed details and realistic reactions to certain situations and whatnot, but regardless I was still able to enjoy this anime. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the character development, for one. I really liked the main characters. However, the two mainmainmain characters were much more fleshed out and paid attention to, overshadowing all the other less-developed characters, which I guess wasn't that hindering, but at times I wished I could have stomped into the anime and got to know the characters that I didn't get to know while watching it. \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I really liked about this anime was its emphasis on how beautiful life really is despite all of the ugly, grotesque, unpleasant chaos that's very often mixed in. One of the main characters, after experiencing one of life's not-so-pleasant things at a somewhat young age, is very cold and hardened after the fact, and there's something just so realistic about that particular character. They are human, they have good moments and equally bad, more darker moments, which I really liked while watching this. It made it easier to emphasize with them and understand why they didn't find much beauty in anything, really. I felt like I could just hop onto the bandwagon of their pain and what they've gone through and then jump off the bandwagon and understand. Also, the bond between the two main characters gradually grows stronger over the duration of the series, which was a plus. \\n\\n\r\nI liked the art style; it was pretty, but it wasn't over-the-top or generic either. It was pleasant. The sound was very impressive. One of the main themes from the anime, 'The Tender Rain', is a very beautiful song. So that gets a '10' under the sound category. \\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed watching this anime despite its drawbacks; it was very amusing, easy and fun to watch, and it wasn't hard to grasp what was going on. However, at times, the reactions of the characters and what happened was a bit too laid back and dolloped with a bit too much shoujo sparkly rosy frosting on top at times when it should have been slightly more serious because it would have made more sense, but other than that it was pretty good. I rarely got bored with this anime, which somewhat surprised me. There were a few not-too-detrimental lulls in the plot line, but it didn't make me grimace and click away from the anime. \\n\\n\r\nSo, would I recommend this anime? If you like a laid back, easy-to-understand plot and a bit of deep meaning and thought sprinkled on it, and you're willing to watch a shoujo that isn't too uncomfortably shoujo if you cringe at the term 'shoujo', then yes. This isn't exactly one of my favorite anime(Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood and Toshokan Sensou are very precious to me *u*), but it's not one of my least favorite, either. 7/10; 70%! This anime got a C. Barely passing, but it's still solid enough to enjoy. I hope you liked this review! This is my first review. Also, I don't mean to insult anyone with what they like; we all have different tastes, after all. :3",

            "content": "Soredemo Sekai wa Utsukushii. A great romance anime. This was an anime I was really looking forward to, but I waited until it finished airing. I'm just not patient enough to wait for a whole week every time after watching just one episode. Never mind, I'll start my review:\r\nStory 10/10\r\nThe story is about Nike, the fourth princess of the rain kingdom. As she lost a rock-paper-scissors match to her sisters, she has to go to the sun kingdom and marry the king. When she arrives, she finds out the king is a kid. But that apart, the king has a very closed personnality and orderspeople around. Nike, who often gets frustrated about it, tries to change him. Through the episodes, you will see how they will grow to each other, and a romance story will develop. \\n\r\nPersonnally, I thought the story was original, because I haven't really seen a story like this before. Of course, someone gets married of, but most of those story's are about a guy who is older than the main girl. And this is different in this story. \\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\r\nThe art was good, it was realistic and it fitted the characters. I liked the way everything looked, their emotions were well shown and there was also attention paid to the surroundings. I thought it was pretty well done.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\r\nI thought the voices fitted the characters very well, there were no annoying voices or sounds in this anime (thank god). I also liked the opening and ending song, as well as Nike's own song when she calls forth the rain.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10\\n\r\nBecause there are two main characters I will just talk about them:\\n\r\nNike: I already said she is the forth princess of the rain kingdom, well, if you can really call it a kingdom. But never mind that. She speaks her mind and cares a lot about others. She is also troubled by Livius' behavior and he slowly opens up to her. She is brave, and doesn't change her mind when she wants to achieve something.\\n\r\nLivius: I have no idea how old he is, but het acts like he is the same age as Nike, maybe even older. In the beginning, he is stiff, a workaholic and doesn't want ayone to say a word against him. Except from his mother, he doesn't really see anybody as his family. In the beginning, he finds Nike annoying and doesn't want her interfering with stuff. However, he gradually loosens up a bit, begins to trust Nike and wants to protect her.\\n\\n\r\nI thought both main characters where great, they stand up for themselves and for each other. They 'fight' pretty much, but that's just funny to watch. I definitely loved the way how they began to trust each other more. There relationship develops trough the episodes. Of course they have some trials to go through. It's not just an anime with a lot of happiness, then I would probably have thought it was to sweet.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nAs I think you already can see it through what I said earlier, I really enjoyed this anime. It got me addicted, so I kept watching. It has a fantasy element because Nike can do something special. Also this makes the story original. And of course, I'll say it again, I liked the romance, it was cute in it's own way. I was actually pretty glad that, even though Livius was still a boy, he didn't act like he was one. Well, he got trough a lot of grief so that made him act like that. Anyway, I enjoyed this anime really much.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\r\nYeah, I know, I know, I didn't give all the categories a 10, but still, I give the overall a 10. As someone who's fond of romance animes, I really enjoyed this anime. I had high expectations and they came true. So if you like romance animes with a small fantasy toutch, this really is an anime you should watch.\\n\\n\r\nI really hope my review helped you a bit, you should watch this anime. Don't hestitate, just watch it. That's all I can say. I loved it. I hope you will too.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Story: I can sum it up in two words: Stockholm Syndrome. That's what's going on in this anime and there isn't a more obvious example available. It isn't a true romance. The king essentially holds the girl hostage and then she gradually falls for him. She begins to see what she wants to see in him (the fact that he's emotionally damaged and needs to be loved) and soon forgets the fact that she's there against her wishes.\r\nCharacters: I'll start with Livius. He's the child of a king but since his mother was a commoner both he and his mother were treated like outcasts. Asa kid he somehow ascended the throne and became king after his mother died. He acts like a spoiled brat and nobody likes him. So how did he become king and why do people accept that he's king? If he's so hated, why hasn't anyone just killed him yet and made life better for everyone? No idea. The first questions are never really answered which bugged me. The second question isn't answered either which bugged me more. It would have been so easy to kill and replace him and nobody would have cared.\\n\\n\r\nNike is a princess from a far off kingdom that has been promised to the Sun King. She starts off as a strong willed, likable character who can be a bit stubborn at times. But over the course of the show I came to dislike her more and more. Almost certainly because she softens and somehow falls in love with her captor, the child king Livius. She has a unique ability to bring rain when she sings.\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound are both great and there isn't much to say about them. Overall I didn't enjoy the show for reasons I've given above.",

            "content": "I found this series rather uninspired. Lacking in intrigue , it tries too hard in all the wrong ways while leaving its potential strengths to languish in the derived mediocrities of the shojo genre. The plot mechanic of the age disparity between the protagonists, especially in light of their genders, was the sole unique feature that drew me to this anime (as I'm fond of unconventional romances) and partially redeems it after the fact. Perhaps I was expecting too much of this series but like an initially idealistic parent later turned sour on the realities of life; I am left simply disappointed at the wasteof potential. The suspense and drama in this series felt artificial and plainly predictable, as though they were set pieces (and not in the intriguing Machiavellian way) used to force the movement of plot or check off tropes from a list. Aside from the aforementioned plot mechanic this series was very much analogous to a stereotypical harem anime and like the rehashed harem anime, this series probably won't be well received outside its target audience aside from as a guilty pleasure. The short of it is: if you are an older veteran of anime who has a taste for the cerebral in shows or being kept on your toes as a viewer of romance/drama, then look elsewhere. If you are however a younger viewer, perhaps even a virgin to the genre, and you have a fancy for the Japanese re-imagining (i.e. stereotyping) of western high fantasy settings then this series might be for you.",

            "content": "I\u2019ll start off this review by making it clear that I haven\u2019t read the manga and knew nothing about this story when I decided to start watching the anime, therefore my opinion is purely based on the latter.\r\nThis being said, I was less than impressed with it, in fact I\u2019m surprised that the vast majority of the reviews are positive and praise this enough to rate it with a 10\u2026 but anyway, everyone\u2019s entitled to their opinion and here\u2019s mine: Soredemo Sekai wa Utsukushii was mediocre at best. Let me break down the reasons:\r\nStory 4/10\r\nKnowing nothing about this anime or its characters, I must saythe premise was good enough to catch my eye, even though it is obvious that sotries relating to arranged marriages are nothing new, but anyway, they\u2019re my guilty pleasure. However the story fell flat. Everything happened way too fast and everything seemed to be a BIG PLOT DEVICE to get the main two characters to fall in love with each other and I must say it was not believable at all and seemed to be quite forced. \\n\\n\r\nArt 5/5\\n\\n\r\nThe art was mediocre, and even though it\u2019s not so bad that it becomes an eyesore to watch, it was somehwat unconfortable. I just can\u2019t with lazy animation and backgrounds, it\u2019s a big no-no for me.\\n\r\nAlso, it seemed to me that all the efforts were centered on the main two characters, Nike the princess and What\u2019s-his-name the (Kid) King; but even so, their design was boring and I must also say that I was not impressed by the efforts to make their clothing mildly interesting.\\n\\n\r\nSound 4/5\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was just meh\u2026 I skipped every single song in this anime, they were very annoying and the background music was very cheesy at times.\\n\r\nThe rest was ok I guess.. nothing remarkable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 5/5\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were decent, at least the main two. The heroine wasn\u2019t a damsel in distress and the King wasn\u2019t your usual main male character, he was a kid and that fact made it somewhat interesting even though the reverse lolicon scenario bothered me. The rest of the characters were 2D, mere plot devices. And that\u2019s all I can say for them, seriously.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 3/5\\n\\n\r\nThe episodes dragged, that\u2019s why I dropped this anime really fast. I normally give animes a shot even when my first impression of them isn\u2019t all that good. I at least give it the chance to present the characters, explain the main plot, etc, but when I\u2019m halfway through the third episode of an anime with a total of 12 and I\u2019m mind numbingly bored and constantly distracted with just about anything and I can\u2019t even be bothered to pay attention that\u2019s when I know for sure it\u2019s a lost cause for me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 3/5\\n\\n\r\nI really wanted to like this anime, I promise, but there were far too many flaws for me. \\n",

The story is so beautiful just as how beautiful the title of this anime is. I have never seen such a wonderful romance anime like The World is Still Beautiful. It is in it\u2019s own niche. As much as it hurts for me to say, but I am both glad and sad that there is no sequel to this show. Glad because I think 12 eps was not too short nor not too long for the binging experience but sad because Ijust wanted to see more of Nike and Livi :\u2019(    A few OVAs would be alright just to show us some episodes of their life together but I suppose ep 12 is self-explanatory as to how their everyday lives would technically be.\\n\r\nThere isn\u2019t much to say for my case apart from the fact this really hit me deep.\\n\r\nOverall, I\u2019d give it a 10/10. The \u2018feels\u2019 factor of the OSTs are too much for me (in a good and sentimental way).\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re into romance and also like fantasy and a hint of drama, I really recommend you (if you haven\u2019t seen it yet) to watch this. It will be worth it.\\n\\n\r\nThe romance is perfect. Truly a GEM.\\n\r\n(but then again, to each their own^^ :)   )",

            "content": "Shoujo. A genre catered towards women and thus, a lot of people steer clear of it; preferring the good ol' natured shounen and action that'll make their bloods pumping. \r\nI am one of those people. \r\nBut sometimes, I still delve into the deep well of this genre, hoping to find a masterpiece at the bottom. And I'm glad to proclaim that this anime is one of them. \r\nSoredemo Sekai wa Utsukushii is all about Nike who got sent off to the Sun Kingdom to marry their king who's also the World King so that her kingdom would maintain its autonomy status. Nike, being a strongwilled girl, accepted her fate and was surprised that her fianc\u00e9 is, in fact, a bratty, self-centered, and aloof child! This results to adorably hilarious interactions between them as they overcome obvious flaws and discover that despite everything, the world is still beautiful (pun intended). \\n\\n\r\nOk, I know what you're thinking. A love story between a teenage girl and a kid? Are you serious? Wait, is this even legal? \\n\\n\r\nBefore more questions sprung out, let me cut you off there and blatantly state that yes, this is about a teenager and a kid BUT the age gap is only 4 years at most. Besides, this is set in the medieval times and it's perfectly normal during that time. I know it can be uncomfortable but bear with it. Give it a chance to try to win you over because I promise you, it's worth it. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, if you deem that you can't just watch an anime between an older woman and a shotacon, well, go on and continue your journey. Let me just say you don't know what you're missing. \\n\\n\r\nNow that we got those aside, let's continue.\\n\\n\r\n~[Sound]~\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the OP and ED of this anime failed to catch my attention. It's still pleasing to listen to but forgettable. The main OST of the series which is heard almost every ep is catchy and has some beautiful meaning behind it but that's about it. It's almost played every ep and it gets tiring. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, the various versions of that song heard throughout the series helped make it a bit \"new\" and I honestly found myself still enjoying it despite the repetition. And the orchestra version is the best. \\n\\n\r\nScore: 8/10\\n\\n\r\n~[Art]~\\n\\n\r\nIt has the classic shoujo and old school feel to it which instantly reminded me of the anime I watched in the 90s and early 2000s. But the character design are unoriginal and I can find myself seeing other anime characters in the cast. That's not always a bad thing because for me, anime will always have a somewhat similarity with others and as long as the other factors are decent, then it's fine in my book. \\n\\n\r\nThere were no still shots (there was one scene but its purpose is for comedy) but there were some scenes where the characters look unnatural and derpy making it unpleasant to the eyes. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, when the heroine uses her powers, it turns magnificent. I love the ripple effects, the formation of the clouds and the likes, and paired with the song truly made it a great moment. But for me, that's not the strongest side of this anime's art. It's, in fact, the backgrounds. \\n\\n\r\nI'm a huge fan of backgrounds and I love how they were drawn in this anime. The colors harmonized beautifully creating an unforgettable sight perfect for emotionally pivotal scenes and definitely adds to the impact. \\n\\n\r\nScore: 9/10\\n\\n\r\n~[Story]~\\n\\n\r\nIt's a shoujo anime so expect to see a lot of shoujo tropes that are cheesy but because of the overall execution and the great cast, will still make it entertaining. \\n\\n\r\nThere weren't a lot of drama and it's mostly about Livius I and Nike living their lives as the Sun King and Queen respectively while growing closer and closer each day. This type of anime is perfect to those who are looking for something that can cheer them up or if they're tired of too much drama. \\n\\n\r\nSo if you found any tropes undesirable, bear with it. It gets better I promise.\\n\\n\r\nScore; 10/10\\n\\n\r\n~[Characters]~\\n\\n\r\nNow, onto the best side of this anime - its characters. This anime has one of the best ensemble out there. Everyone is just so adorably hilarious and lovable; and each of their individual quirks harmonize well with others that you can't help but get invested in them. \\n\\n\r\nNike is one of the best shoujo heroines out there. She's strong willed, determined, kind and not afraid to stand up for what's right. She also has morals and principles in life that she's willing to fight for till the end and I find that very amazing. She is the epitome of heroines and I hope I'll encounter more characters like her. \\n\\n\r\nLivius I is a good character. He's quite realistic (ironic, I know) and great character development throughout the series. He's also straightforward for his age and that's great because let's be real, dense MCs can only go so far. However, I admit that without Nike, this stoic and rude kid won't have much of an impact to me. But that's a good thing in this case since it just shows that the main characters compliment each other very well. \\n\\n\r\nThe side characters are amazing as well and despite not having a lot of screen time, they still could create an impact to the viewer and make the whole scene infinitely better. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime only got a high rating because of its characters because despite all of the tropes, they're executed well to the point that I don't mind them and just enjoy the ride. \\n\\n\r\nScore: 10/10 (I'd give it a score higher than 10 if I could.)\\n\\n\r\n~[Conclusion]~\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Soredemo Sekai wa Utsukushii is a great anime with decent sound, good art, nice story and magnificent characters. So if you can get past the age gap, well, expect a lighthearted anime that'll make you feel warm and fuzzy in the inside, laughing your worries away. \\n",

            "content": "\"It goes beyond \u00b4like\u00b4and \u00b4dislike\u00b4. That\u00b4s right. This emotion.. it\u00b4s gratitude I guess\". - Livius\r\nI often start to watch many shoujo/romance anime with a bit of skepticism, due to many of them are very stereotypical and doesn't bring something new and interesting (and don't even get me started about the damsel in distress-card that's being played way to often). But in this case I was very positively surprised. So why was \"Soredemo Sekai wa Utsukushii\" (The World is Still Beautiful) so different and great in it genres? I will get down to that know.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nThe first thing that appealed to me. The title \"The worldis still beautiful\" is a very suiting title - how two people can make the world beautiful for each other, then at least one of them lost the ability to see the worlds beauty and the other never really saw the worlds true colors. They have manage to weave together shoujo, romance, adventure and fantasy brilliantly. Instead of having cute young girl meets handsome young man who instantly falls in love, we have a tomboy princess meets.. well.. boy king. And it\u00b4s definitely not love at first sight. *small spoiler* They actually getting in to a fight and Nike (tomboy princess) is thrown in jail by the boy king Livius *end spoiler*. And from there the story pretty much kicks off. They come from totally different worlds and slowly they start to understand and open up to each other. One of most beautiful love stories I seen. The show is pretty episodic but that didnt bother me at all, they managed to smooth out the lines well. The story isnt just about the romance, we also have some political intrigues, family issues and magic. We even get some darker moments and the comedy was actually pretty great. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThe art isnt amazing overall, but absolutely more then decant. The thing that did stood out was some of the scenery\u00b4s. The sky in different times of the day, the falling rain and some silhouette of the castle and garden was absolutely stunning. Character designs was pretty great, liked them all (yes, you will run in to bi-shies). \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nI liked the OST. It managed to highlight the atmosphere in the scenes and was over all pretty beautiful - the word I\u00b4m looking for is suiting. OP song fitted the show good and was pretty catchy. Voice acting was great (watched subbed). I really liked the voice actor of Livius - he really made a good job of bringing out Livius character. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nOne of the best things about this show. Both Nike and Livius are great characters, who for just a 12 episodes show had a lot of development without losing their original self's. I liked all of the supporting cast as well, but they were not that fleshed out so you really didn't get to know them that much (besides Bard that is). So who are Nike and Livius? Let me tell you.\\n\\n\r\nNike - A teenage tomboy princess with a special gift. She can call up the rain and wind. The wind can she also use as a weapon to literately slice of blades and steal. Nike takes order from no one at all. She is also very kindhearted and clever. Nike isnt over powered by no means, but her skills do come in handy. She sees the beauty in the world, and are like the wind - she feels like a free spirit that see and do things in ways others don't. Really refreshing in this genre. \\n\\n\r\nLivius - The boy king (I think he\u00b4s around 12). Don\u00b4t appear as boy at all. He has the eyes of a much older man and can sometimes be quite cruel. When the show starts, he\u00b4s been a king for 3 years and conquered many countries. Livius has been marked by his past and become very cold and distant. He has lost the ability to see the beauty of the world. To see him with Nike's help to appreciate the beauty in the world again was heartbreaking. \\n\\n\r\nThey have one of the most beautiful relationship developments I ever seen in anime. Yes, I know I probably over use the word beautiful here but that is what it is. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI marathoned throw \"The world is still beautiful\" in a day. So yes, I enjoyed it hell of a lot. Great story, unique paring and the hardship they had to go throw was awesome. Add some nice music and scenery to it, and we have something unique and beautiful added to the shoujo/romance genres. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nGREAT is the word. Absolutely loved every second of it. Never ever was I annoyed, bored or confused. Yes, i cried and laughed to this one. The story wasnt super deep or complex, but it contained realistic elements that made it feel so much more alive. From what I heard, it is material for a second season so I have my hopes up. I really wan\u00b4t to see the rest of the journey of Nike and Livius.",

            "content": "After much googling, checking out forums and basically watching any Youtube video that even coughs up the word anime, I still end up finding rare anime that I feel that most people completely forgot to check out. Like seriously, how the heck did I miss to check out an anime like \u2018The World Is Still Beautiful\u201d. So, without further ado, I am gonna start my review!\r\nAfter losing a game of rocks, papers and scissors our main female protagonist Princess Nike no not Nike, has to marry to the Sun God or the conqueror of the world known as Livius II. And I am not evenkidding when I say that is the plot of the show. Yeah,  this lovely girl\u2019s fate was decided by a game of rocks, papers scissors. Anyway, Nike comes from a distant and secluded land and oh yeah she has some interesting powers of controlling the weather. After some troubles here and there Nike finally makes it to the kingdom where to her shock she meets Ciel, I mean Lelouch, I mean King Livius II. Who is actually only 2 years younger than her despite the fact, he looks ten to be exact.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the first time I saw the king the first thing that popped into my mind was Joffrey from Game of Thrones. And let\u2019s face it, I am pretty sure many of you got the impression that this little fella over here is something of a head chopping obsessed, whiny and worthless bitch. So, after he like threw her in the dungeon I somewhat got an impression that this guy was going to be a royal pain. However, Livius in reality is one adorable badass and the show actually does a good job of portraying him as a suitable, strong and mature king.\\n\\n\r\nWhen Nike meets him, she and the audience realizes that there is nothing childlike about him. He actually behaves like what a ruler might behave like. Sure, once or twice when you see him talk or behave you just want to pinch his cheeks or hug him to death but most of the time I completely forget that he's a fifteen year old stuck in a ten year old\u2019s body! Like seriously I do!\\n\\n\r\nAlso, some people including me thought it was hysterical that this little kid was getting engaged to what looks like a younger version of Scarlett Johansson. Now, our main female character on the other hand is a breath of fresh air. Not only is she drop dead gorgeous but she in a sense is like the show\u2019s main comic relief character. She has a wonderful personality considering the fact she is funny, stubborn, kind and just so awesome. I mean, I think the best part is that the show doesn\u2019t portray her character in such a way, which is over the top and annoying, unlike most characters with her traits tend to be like. I truly loved Nike and I loved how the show explored her character during it\u2019s run.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the show\u2019s biggest triumph is creating a successful and memorable bond between the two leads. Now, you look at these two and you're like yeah that\u2019s not gonna work. I mean, I don\u2019t mean to be rude but she kinda looks old enough to be his mom even though they are two years apart. Also, despite both of them being royalty, I was curious to how these two characters will mesh together into something wonderful.  And, I must be honest when I say that the chemistry between them is just over 9000.\\n\\n\r\nTheir interactions are funny, sweet and sometimes sad. And I know many people would just dismiss this show because of the height and age difference, but I have a feeling that if they actually sat down and watched this they would be charmed by it.  Also, I am not gonna lie I was expecting a hot and strong king and I was a little disappointed deep inside that it wasn\u2019t the case. But, then it got me thinking that if both characters didn\u2019t have contrasting personalities and looks then the show wouldn\u2019t be as epic and original compared to the heaps of romance anime out there. So, after episode two I was really glad that they chose this guy over here to be the main male character. \\n\\n\r\nThe last time, I felt like this about a romance anime was when I watched Inu X Boku SS. Actually, when I watched that show it took me five episodes or so to realize that Ririchiyo and Sousei are supposed to be love interests. I mean, it was obvious in the first episode the way they were shining the spotlight on them, but I didn\u2019t want to believe it at the time. However, this show immediately establishes the fact that these two are gonna shoot love arrows through our kokoros. And that\u2019s something Inu X Boku SS missed the mark for!\\n\\n\r\nHowever the romance between Nike and Livius is however nothing like the one between Ririchiyo and Sousei. In fact, the show despite its 12 episode limit slowly, slowly with each episode succeeded in developing their relationship. It never felt rushed despite the fact that the characters knew each other for three or so months. Also, unlike most romance anime, the show doesn\u2019t necessarily wait till the end for the two to get together.\\n\r\nNow, this is something I tend to loathe and kindly excuse in many romance anime, but I was just delighted that they made sure the two characters kissed after a short period of time. Also, it\u2019s hilarious that a couple so amazing got engaged even before Nike or we saw the king. \\n\\n\r\nThe show however focused so much on developing the main leads that they more or less disregarded the supporting cast as nothing more than just side characters that were just there for the show and not the tell. I mean, they could\u2019ve given Neil or the servants a little bit more depth so that they would have been as memorable as our two leads. Also, even if we are introduced to Nike\u2019s family towards the last few episodes properly I wish they would have done a better job giving us a taste of what they were really like. Sure, we get the idea they are wacky, caring and supportive, but they really didn\u2019t go into much detail. The only exception was the relationship between Nike and her grandmother and I am not going to talk much about that because I don\u2019t want to spoil anything.\\n\\n\r\nLivius on the other hand doesn\u2019t really have a family - well except his uncle Bard. Now, the reason why his character is so proud, diligent, hard working, miserable is due to the fact he lost his mother he loved so much. I know this may sound insensitive but the relationship between the two and flashbacks of his mother is just so clich\u00e9d at this point. I mean, honestly , I never understood why Livius loved his mother so much I mean yeah there is a the fact that all mothers well except for Medusa from Soul Eater, love their kids, but all the flashbacks and Livius\u2019 words were just not enough to convince us that the mother was anything special. She to me felt as if she was another clich\u00e9d dead parent, which sounds so mean coming out of my mouth!\\n\\n\r\nNow, the uncle on the other hand, his character was clich\u00e9d too. I mean, I have seen so many characters like him in the past and he also looks like many anime characters with his traits. There is nothing interesting about him, despite the fact he is this Casanova who loved Livius\u2019 mother and has been broken deep inside ever since. In fact, he was my least favourite character in the entire show. The arc surrounding him was nothing too spectacular and I just found him to be annoying and also useless to the plot. But, he did stir some conflict, so I will give him credit for that!\\n\\n\r\nThe fantasy elements of the show was okay, average at best. I mean, sure not every anime has rain summoning maidens in them so that works well to the show\u2019s credit. However, they didn\u2019t really dive much into the concept of nature, rain and magic or how or why Nike and her family has these powers. They merely just scratched the surface to all of these, and didn\u2019t really give it the importance it deserved!\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy on the other hand was executed perfectly and I felt it had a nice balance with the drama of the show. Like the show was flawlessly able to switch from a serious tone to a more comedic mode without any trouble which many shows tend to struggle to do. The jokes in this show was hilarious even though it was not \u2018rolling on the floor laughing\u2019 hilarious.  Also, the show even sneakily broke the fourth wall once or twice, which I thought was superb!\\n\\n\r\nThe animation of the show on the other hand was very decent and also consistent. It was not the best animation I have seen, but it was still really bright and colourful with wonderful character designs. Also, despite being a shoujo, romance I am glad that show didn\u2019t have too much sparkly, pink backgrounds which can be very annoying at times. Sure, they had some I think but nothing that would get on a person\u2019s nerve!\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending themes are nothing that extraordinary but still good for a show like this. The song \u2018Tender Rain\u2019 that Nike sings to call the rain was wonderful too, even though I felt that it was reaching \u2018Let It Go\u2019 status by being played practically during every episode. But, I still personally loved it and I feel it\u2019s going to be one of the most memorable things about the show.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the overall plot of the show was nothing too extravagant or interesting, but you watch this show for Livius and Nike. They make the show something worth watching especially for those that enjoy romantic comedies. So, after much thought I have decided to award this wonderful show with an 8 out of 10 and a recommendation to definitely to check out this freaking fantabulous show. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Where do I begin with this one? I had such high expectations for this anime, only to be met with a disappointing piece of poorly written garbage. Soredemo Sekai Wa Utskushi is an abomination of utter cringe and forced romance. In my honest opinion I have no clue what the writers were thinking, heck, I don't even know if they were thinking at all.\r\nStory: 2\r\nOh God, I actually might need a medical prescription after witnessing these writers try to create anything even close to a story. The story in this anime can be compared to a ship that broke down before the journey began, butdecided to set sail anyway! There's absolutely no real, lasting conflict that is presented throughout the entire show. No main antagonist, no rising action, no climax, no nothing! It's like watching every filler episode from Naruto and expect the plot to develop, which is absurd. If you thought that this show was going to provide political warfare, wars, or even romance, then you are sadly sadly mistaken; All it will provide you with is a fast one to your nearest emergency room.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\\n\r\nNow I have to say, despite the dreadful story, this anime certainly tries to correct itself when it comes to animation, and I used the word 'tries' for a reason. It's nothing incredibly special, but sometimes you might catch yourself mesmerized by the beauty and color of the environment. The characters aren't dull either, which provides them with a certain distinctiveness that's aesthetically pleasing. However, in general, the overall animation is only slightly above average. With only a select few scenes in each episode that make this production stand out, in terms of artwork of course.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\\n\r\nMaybe I'm being slightly generous here, because I absolutely dread the song that Nike sings to call the rain, which, may I tell you, has been milked more times than an average cow\u2019s lifespan. I think the director thought we would really like this song, which probably explains why he clearly felt no shame in gracing us with the abruptly annoying soundtrack every other episode. Well, aside from that, the opening and ending songs were actually quite enjoyable, and I found myself singing along a couple of times. The anime soundtrack is also pretty decent, incorporating many instruments widely used in medieval times, in order to set the right mood. If only the scenes matched up with some of the tearfully dramatic music, I would have reveled it a bit more, because instead, I was left cringing to the point of actual, physical pain.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 2\\n\\n\r\nIt's been a while since my mind has experienced this type of agony, but this show reminds me that it really hurts. I'm not sure how many migraines I got throughout the journey, but I certainly can't count them with one hand. What, just what in the name of sweet Neptune was the director thinking when he tried to develop these \"characters\". My cat has gone through more genuine development than every single one of these morons combined. None of the people in this anime actually follow their supposed given agendas. The king, livi, or livius, or whatever, is supposed to be a cold hearted king that managed to conquer the entire world and its kingdoms. Let's ignore the fact that he's only a 12-year-old kid with an 8-year-old body, how did someone like him manage to do something like that with such a flimsy, plastic personality. I kid you not, the boy has a new personality in every new episode. One time he's angry at everything, one time he's loving and easily flustered, and one time he's just purely arrogant and pretentious. Then comes the princess, Nike, this girl has successfully made me cringe more times than I've actually said the word. She's described as rash and brave, but all I can see is blinding stupidity. She accepts challenges that put her life in danger, when there is clearly an easier option that yields the same result. Of course, her knight in shining armor that can't even fit the armor comes to her rescue, and somehow still tolerates her every time. I swear to God I still cannot figure out why she fell in love with him or why he fell in love with her, there's just nothing that these two can do together that won't look awkward, add to the fact they have absolutely nothing in common, add to the fact that he\u2019s a child and she\u2019s almost an adult. It becomes clear halfway through the show that there isn\u2019t much to support the reasons for why they feel affection towards each other. It\u2019s just bluntly forced to keep the romance going. Next up are the antagonists, oh and what a joke they are. Calling them antagonists just doesn't even feel right. They're just a couple of lousy \"bad guys\" with ridiculously weak drives behind their actions, which ultimately makes you beg the question \"why did you do it in the first place?!\" I mean, they go through so much trouble to prove their point, but the moment anyone fights back, the moment someone makes a peep, they seem to just give up and realize that indeed, they were wrong after all. Of course, all of this incorporates dangerously meaningless dialogue that'll leave you with multiple seizures and severe brain damage.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4\\n\\n\r\nYes, sure, there were some rare moments throughout the show where I wanted to know what happens next. However, most of the time I was just spacing out. There was a time where 2 episodes flew by and I was still thinking about why a princess would wear the same clothes every single day, and then sleep in them. Another time I decided to practice how to dab midway through an episode, and spent around 15 minutes trying to perfect the move, all the while I\u2019m watching this sad and boring anime. I hadn\u2019t felt this happy finishing a show since my graduation in 2014. I felt so happy that I wanted to share the experience with all of you, so that you never make the same mistake I made.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, you\u2019re left with a bitter taste in your mouth, that just won\u2019t leave no matter how hard you rinse. Soredemo Sekai Wa Utskushi is an insult not only to the anime industry, but also, to human intelligence, because there is no way people could actually be that profoundly stupid and still be considered normal. I am willing to pay money to wipe this title off the shelves. It would be an act of charity on my part, because I\u2019d actually be helping people. If you want to end up like Leonard Shelby from Memento, then here\u2019s your chance. Otherwise, please stray clear from this dreadfully mortifying anime.\\n",

            "content": "First off: If you were going to turn away because of the obvious age difference and height difference between Nike and Livi, stick around until you finish reading this at least. \r\nI recently finished reading a manga called 'Hapi Mari' about an arranged marriage. I quickly found out there was a whole genre of this specific cliche, so I got curious and did some research, during which this anime popped up. At first, I added it to my Plan to Watch and didn't really pay much attention to it until I came across it again weeks later. Curious, I read the summary to find theLivi and Nike have an age and height difference. Usually, that wouldn't have bothered me if Livi wasn't so young. Because he is (and looks) like a child, I thought I would feel rather uncomfortable watching him parade around with a heroine that looks nearly like an adult. Somewhere in my head, however, something told me to go ahead and give it a try, so against my better judgment, I watched an episode to find myself pleasantly surprised. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the 'arranged marriage' cliche is a tale as old as time, the slightly creative take on it leaves the story more fresh and fun to watch. Since it's only twelve episodes, the anime doesn't have a very overarching plot across it other than the romance, but for a rom-com anime, it isn't all that bad. It's nothing that hasn't been seen before, but it's unique enough to grab my (very-short) attention and hold it. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is very clean, colorful, and fun. I rarely come across art that I don't like, so this isn't really a problem. Most of the clothes and settings aren't very intricate,  which I would have liked to see, however. \\n\\n\r\nSince the 'rain songs' are what the series centers around, they put some considerable effort into them. They aren't the best songs I've ever heard, but they can get me swaying a bit and are pretty catchy to say the least. \\n\\n\r\nLivi's character, while not developed extensively, is pretty layered and fun to explore, especially since he's a child. While Nike is considerably flat, she is much more fun that most other heroines, especially because she's usually the one saving Livi. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this a lot! I binged it over the course of three days (I was also finishing a J Drama and working towards deadlines at the same time... procrastination at it's finest!) and I was extremely pleased with the entertainment I got as a result. :) \\n\\n\r\nI will definetly be reading the manga as well! \\n\\n\r\nI would recommend if: you like strong heroines, you like elemental powers, you like power-hungry children, you like rom-coms, you like kissing and awkward romance, the arranged marriage cliche\\n\\n\r\nI would NOT recommend if: you are SEVERELY turned off by men being shorter/younger than women in relationships (I would still recommend watching an episode or two and giving it a try), you prefer darker themes, you don't really like romance or comedy, you're looking for something serious\\n\\n\r\nAs Livi himself says, the height difference between him and Nike won't last forever, so why all the worrying?\\n\\n\r\nHave a great day guys!!! :D",

            "content": "This is not a good fantasy anime. I don't think it's a good romance anime as well, since the plot runs pretty much on rails, which is made worse by the fact that the rails are those of a tropeish romance. But maybe you like trope-ridden romance, so let me focus on the fantasy aspects.\r\nFantasy has certain expectations, like having a setting that is fantastic without endangering the suspension of disbelief. For an instance, if the capital has access to water despite the eternal drought, why does the emperor needs a rainmaker? Why would the author make a city with no rain if that hasno effect on the city or on the people? It's like the author thought it would be nice thematically, but never gave any thinking to the possible consequences (also, there is no way that extremely green palace exists in a place without rain and let's not talk about the amount of crops needed to feed a conquering army.). I'll not mention the royal protocol problems, because anime enjoys the hell out of not adhering to protocols (mainly because their lovely princes would have to sentence people to death, since you have to remember people the royals are untouchable), but I'll have to say there is a visible lack of nobility. Those guys that wanted to oust the king/emperor, did they actually have a plan or they intended to drown the world in a succession war? I'd call it a plot hole, but there isn't much plot to speak of, since the story is mostly about the romance and any other part of the plot just goes away. I mean, the opposing nobles just gave up on their conspiracy after a minor setback. \\n\\n\r\nWhich leads me to the characters, which are generally stereotyped and mostly devoid of motivations, so that they feel like plot-puppets. Even the main characters just act the way plot expects them to, without consideration or planning. Livius is technically a tyrant, but he's a cute little tyrant that everyone likes, so that's ok, even if he tortures people or threatens to destroy your country for any reason. The dark part doesn't matter, because it's there just as window dressing: he's a dark prince, that's all. And Nike is the innocent/joyful princess that never heard of diplomacy, even though she was raised/groomed by the queen mother, possibly to succeed her, and should be at least aware of politics. But why would she,  if it's cuter and more tropeish to be an innocent flower, right? All the enforced stereotypes make for a disappointing story, is what I'm saying. \\n\r\nAnd don't get me started on Rain All The Time country and it's pointless royalty.\\n\r\nIn general, bad fantasy, author Did Not Do Research.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the rest, well, there is nothing incredible about the sound, animation or technical aspects. The character designs look a bit dated (the series is few years old) and the clothes make absolutely no sense, unless you'd care to explain why do the people from eternal summer country choose to cover head to toe (even their religion is sun-centered. You'd expect hiding from the sun to be anathema to that).\\n\\n\r\nOverall I do not recommend to anyone but the most dedicated shoujo fans.",

Saying this as my personal opinion, I could say that some of those new series can be called \"boring and nonsensical\". I could also say that, Soredemo Sekai wa Utsukushii isn't like those anime that I dropped watching.\r\nThe first episode already caught my interest, I mean, it's definitely not typical for a romantic anime to have it's heroine older, taller and more mature than his leading man. This series is too cute. I just love the love-hate yet sweet relationship of the MC. The art is beautiful,so is the voice of Nike. \\n\\n\r\nThis is pretty entertaining, some scenes are just nut cracker. I love the fact that this anime isn't just for entertainment, it has a deeper meaning to it. It reminds us that there is always beauty beneath every small things we take for granted, it tells us that despite everything, the world is still beautiful. \\n\\n\r\nA romantic anime that doesn't have a typical plot. If you're looking for that, then this is for you.",

The colours of the characters hairs were well-painted, especially Livius'.\r\nSound - 10\r\nThe sound was amazing! The song of Nike is awesome and just her voice - beautiful! ,,Tender rain\" almost made me cry. \r\nCharacters - 7\r\n*Spoilers*\r\nLivius - This ,,kid\" is really interesting character. I think he is 15. He owns the world and this had made him a bit arrogant, cold and rough. Also his mother had died years ago and deep inside he is lonely andsensitive. He changes later and becomes better person.\\n\\n\r\nNike - I am not sure about her age (probably 17). Nike is the youngest daughter of the rain country's king. She is cheerful, energetic and very kind. She is strong heroine and she isnt the typical cliche romance girl. Nike can stand for herself and she believes, that everything and everyone has beauty.\\n\\n\r\nNeil - The cliche butler character, but he was funny one.\\n\\n\r\nIfrika - The cliche flirt/pervert of every shoujo. He makes the male main character jelaous.\\n\\n\r\nAmaluna - The cliche girl, who wants to steal the love interest from MC.\\n\\n\r\nThe only problem to me is that Livi is younger than Nike and just too short.\\n\\n\r\nLivius and Nike are great drawn up, but because of all these cliche characters i will give it 7 mark.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9\\n\\n\r\nI fell in love with this anime! The romance is so cute and heart-warming. Its beautiful, filled with feels, tears and humor.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10\\n\\n\r\nI really recomend you this anime, because it will show you that the world really is still BEAUTIFUL!\\n\\n",

            "content": "I'm normally not one to write anime reviews, but after I finished watching Soredemo I just couldn't help myself. \r\nStory: 7 \r\nThe story itself is very simple - a princess is betrothed to a foreign king to save her country, only to find out when she gets there that he is only a young boy.  Sometimes simplicity is the best option to keep the overall feeling you want in the anime. If this anime had tried to do any complex plots, I believe it would have taken away from the anime as a whole. \r\nArt: 8\r\nThe artwork in the anime was very nice. Itwas simple and worked with the theme and mood of the anime. This is a shojo, romance anime and the artwork suited it perfectly. The style of course cannot be the same as anything like Attack On Titan or Sword Art Online because of the different genre, so it was very fitting and made the anime seem charming.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nWOW. I loved Nike's voice! I immediately fell in love with the soundtrack from Soredemo. Not just the songs with lyrics, but if you listen closely to the background music, it fits each scene like a glove. \"Beautiful Rains\" was a nice song, even if it was overplayed. However the version in the last episode where Nike is feeling a little sad; you can tell it through the song as well. It sounded sad and it was nice to hear that emotion in the song. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nAll of the characters in this anime were well thought out. The main characters: Livi and Nike had development throughout the series, which was very nice to see. You get to see that Love-Hate relationship that turns into one of the sweetest relationships I have ever seen in an anime before....how the writers managed that stumps me, but they must be geniuses! Also, you see very strong supporting characters that always seemed to be around. The butler was an especially strong supporting character. Overall, the characters were extremely well done!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nOkay, I LOVED this anime. If I were to base my entire rating on enjoyment I'd be giving this anime a definite 10 easily, but I have to take into account everything else for my review. This is one of those anime that can just suck you into it. It's charming and sweet with a few dramatic moments that leave you wanting more. Overall it is just a wonderful anime that deserves a chance by everyone!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8.8/10 - round up to 9/10!\\n\\n",

            "content": "Story = 3\r\n--  It was Episodically-Continuous, and that is a horrible recipe for an anime.  It gave the impression of an author simply writing an anime, but forgetting to watch the episodes.  \r\n--  A pretty fascinating concept was created for this story, but that is pretty much where the creator's ingenuity ended.  Many aspects of this story and themes talked about didn't even serve a purpose.  They could've just as easily been talking about tea and progressed the story the same way.\r\n--  The saving grace of this story, fortunately, happens to be that someone understood the selling points.It is a romance anime and meant to be marketed to shoujo lovers.  It does a pretty good job to that end, but every other aspect just seems to be the excuse for making this anime.  This just as well could have been a school anime with very minor re-arranging.  \\n\r\n--  A solid pace was set, and everything flowed into the next pretty smoothly.\\n\\n\r\nArt = 4\\n\\n\r\n--  Nothing Special and the characters were supposed to appeal to one's inner shoujo, I suspect.  Just like most mediocre anime, there are some nice spots and others that one would rather forget.\\n\r\n--  The CGI seemed completely out-of-place when used, and didn't even serve a purpose.  I suspect some Michael Bay prot\u00e9g\u00e9s were working on this anime, because lots of unnecessary effects get used.  The effects have the pompous feel of \"Hey, Look what I can do.\" \\n\r\n--  Each of the characters, at least, had their own individuality, and the scenes that were \"This Scene is Important, so be Impressed, \" those were made quite well.\\n\\n\r\nSound = 4\\n\\n\r\n-- Very good and believable voice actors chosen, and they seemed to have a very good understanding of how to handle everything.  \\n\r\n--  The singing at times gave me a shiver or two.  It was a pleasant surprise from this anime.\\n\r\n--  On the other hand, the effect-lovers even wanted to interfere with the sound.  At times it sounds like someone forgot to soundproof the recording studio.  Also, someone decided to do muffling effects to make speaking from certain places, more realistic.  This gets over-used and is even out-of-place at times.\\n\r\n-- I don't even remember this anime having OSTs, and I watched it yesterday.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters = 2\\n\\n\r\n-- Nearly all characters were horrible creations on the part of the author.  They were simply flat, contradictory existences.  Just like the story \"Flat & Contradictory\" shouldn't even be possible.  This happens because the author wanted to have characters with personalities that he or she had zero experience with.  \\n\r\n--  To establish these characters, at all times, the creator will simply use direct presentation.  After being told directly by the story about the characters; they will pretty much cease to have the traits that were just explained.  Along with that, one could say they never had those traits to begin with.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment = 5\\n\\n\r\n--  Even with all the problems above, this story is still quite likeable.  \\n\r\n--  It had more legit romance than most romance anime, and very well put-together scenes.  This anime clearly just focused on its selling points and drove it home.\\n\r\n-- If one is looking to go \"Moe Moe, Kyun Kyun, \" and get certain desired aspects out of an anime; an excellent job is done to deliver on that. \\n\r\n--  I enjoyed a good bit of this, even though I was disappointed.  This happened because, it tried to sell itself as legit and yet had worse writing than most ecchi/harem anime. \\n\r\n--  I won't forget the anime, and definitely won't watch it again.  Don't let this discourage you though.  The thing I won't forget is that, at times, it did manage to give me shivers. \\n\\n\r\nOverall = 4\\n\\n\r\nYea, I probably would still recommend this to people.  Probably really enjoyable if you're into shoujo.  It's definitely not going to convert anyone that is just trying out the genre though.",

            "content": "Is the world really still beautiful? Is it really?\r\nTo Levius,  the Sun King and basically the ruler of the World, \"Flowers are just flowers\", and \"stars are just stars\". To Levius, the world isn't all that beautiful. Soredemo Sekai wa Utsukushii, This World is Still Beautiful, is a comedic yet fulfilling and passionate tale of two lovers, their quarrels, and the Big and Beautiful World. Yes, the World is still beautiful.\r\nStory: 8\r\nSimplistic on surface, but has plenty of depth. This World is Still Beautiful focuses its story around Nike and Levius, and the clash of two completely different outlooks on life. The coming togetherof the two could only spell disaster logically, but so goes on their arranged marriage, and a breach to the hearts of not only Levius and Nike, but  the viewer as well. There is much emphasis in the multiple themes throughout the 13 episode series. Each little story is surpisingly focused, and besides the well implemented comedic relief, almost no scenes were irrelevant in the slightest. In fact, scene by scene, layers were added in character development, comedic relief, and focus to said themes. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is well paced for the most part, maybe even a tad fast  in regards to how quickly one arc progresses, but nothing seemed unnatural that threw the viewer off. The execution is pretty well done with the introduction to new characters,  New conflicts, and new lessons for Levius and Nike. \\n\\n\r\nThe sole thing that bothered be throughout was the transitions between comical and more happier tones in many of scenes to the dead serious scenes where the world doesn't look so beautiful for anymore. This more often than not is the product of several of the character's interactions and how each, Levius in particular, respond. I'll get more into the characters later, especially our main cast.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, much must be credited to the comedic side of our characters, but more importantly the completely designated comedical roles for the three advisors to Levius.  \\n\\n\r\nArt:7\\n\\n\r\nI didn't find anything to be groundbreaking, but the art style and coloring was solid overall. Animation was smooth, and special effects were well presented and added much to  more atmospheric scenes. I have no Gripes over Character designs, and the background settings served their purpose.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\\n\r\nAn upbeat Opening Sequence matched well with the comical side of the show, but I did find it rather bothersome  knowing the more serious tone the show has knack for including. Apart from that, the Song insert ~Beautiful Rain~ never seems to get old, although admittedly it does lose impact in some episodes. the soundtrack compliments each scene where it is needed, and character's don't come off as unnatural or at the very least, annoying. the ED was relatively catchy as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\\n\r\nIt is without a doubt that there exists much depth in the majority of our cast.  Levius is a prime example, having a dark history, serious nature, and too mature for his own age. Yet, Upon meeting Nike, his tone is different, and we are shown more than just a boy being himself. \\n\\n\r\nMany others within the main cast also have plenty of characterization with no lacking depth. Aside from a few cases, not many of the antagonists are considered  truly evil, and the roles some characters play varies. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter Development is Heavily emphasized and shown through Levius and Nike. While its apparent in other characters as well, the most obvious are the two lovers, so go figure.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\\n\r\nYeah, I completely forgot how much i enjoyed this show. In fact, I liked this so much, at the time of writing this review, I'm here re-watching the series to remind myself of how much i enjoyed it. I'm not picky with small details, and I had a blast with the characters' interactions with one another, and even more so the story. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8 \\n\\n\r\nThe story isn't the most impactful out there, and it surely isn't perfect, but \"This World is Still Beautiful\" offers a pleasant and enjoyable experience fitting of your average viewer. I look back and wonder to myself why I put this off after adding it to a list of many others. I highly recommend this to anyone with a thing for romances, but this show really is befitting of viewers of all interests, although I would not go into this expecting an action heavy or psychological focus.  I hope you'll have as much of a blast as I had with this.\\n\\n\r\nUntil Next Time!",

The plot itself is original and quite beautiful, and the song that Nike sang in almost every episode was a pleasure to listen to. Whenever that familiar tune was cued, a smile was brought to my face.\u00a0\r\nIt was a little weird at first to watch Nike fall in love with someone who was much younger than her, but I got used to it and came to lovethe anime.\u00a0I loved how the comedy in this anime was lowkey - that made it even funnier when something comical happened.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the anime I found little to no flaws. It was the perfect amount of romance and comedy. But... then the ending came. This is the reason the show didn't get a perfect score. The ending of this anime was so dissatisfying that it made me furious. And it's not that the show ended uncompleted, it was the WAY it ended. I don't want to say anything else in fear of spoiling, but if you plan on watching this anime, I suggest you prepare for the most disappointing ending in your life.\u00a0\\n",

But I got worried when I saw it was only 12 episodes long.\r\nThe story is there, a lot of useless filler is cut out since they have to squeeze the manga down to 22 minute chunks. But the basic story is there and it flows well. Of course the anime feels rushed because of this, their romance is rushed because it takes out a lot of filler moments.\r\nThe artwork is beautiful, I like itmore then in the manga. I mean there are some obvious \"silly\" moments where the characters are supposed to look bad so it looks bad there but it's supposed to be bad.\\n\\n\r\nThe music was lovely. Every time Nike sang, I got shivers and it actually stirred some emotions in me. I think this anime did it's best in the music.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are fine. We don't get a lot of time with them given we only have 12 episodes, so I can't really say much here.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed watching the anime, I think it pairs well with the manga.\\n\\n\r\nOverall a good anime. However I am disappointed that it only had 12 episodes and only showed the first 4 volumes of the manga. These volumes are some of the more boring ones when compared to some of the later ones. So it's a real shame we couldn't get more episodes showing some of the better volumes (the desert trip comes to mind).\\n\\n\r\nI'm not sure if the anime didn't get good ratings or if they stopped because they didn't have enough material to continue the story at that time but I'd love to see a second season of this anime. I think it deserves it!",

It's that good. \r\nI don't really know if it was Livius that got me started or the songs Nike sung, but I'm happy I got enraptured with this anime. It was very knew to me and I didn't know who Livius was because I saw it on a \"Recommend\" video on YT so I was like \"ohh.... an arranged marriage in a fantasy world between two obstinateteens? Sign me up!\" and I loved every second of how wrong I was.\\n\r\nThe songs and score were amazing and the plots gave where to character development. The hair bugged me from a little bit in the animation but I got over that it the 1st episode. So I would say to watch this anime because it's entertaining! <3",

            "content": "The synopsis is actually a little misleading in that it doesn't sound too interesting and a little wtf? to be honest. I mean, power to call rain? Right....However, the actual anime impressed me despite the lacklustre-sounding premise. In a nutshell, Soredemo Sekai wa Utsukushii is basically a character-driven romance anime. While watching, I was pleasantly surprised at the plot progression. Without spoiling anything, I can say that a mini-arc approach was taken where there was a central issue, usually involving some kind of politics, for each arc. The transition was smooth but more importantly, as a character-driven anime, we see how the main characters, Nikeand Livius, developed and how the romance grew between the (mismatched) pair. Another thing I liked about the story is how they managed to keep things simple while engaging. Each characters' motives were made very clear and it is very understandable why they chose to carry out the actions that they did. And again, about the rain summoning powers, I still do think it's somewhat cheesy but it is hardly a central focus of the anime. Of course it has its weak points. The lack of central objective/focus means that there is a very heavy reliance on the characters to carry the show, and also what I would call a loss of momentum as the show progressed. Although I would seem to be nitpicking as many slice of life shows do not indeed have any central aim, I felt like there was some kind of climax-resolution structure at around eps 4-5, after which it got a little boring and then picked up again.\\n\\n\r\nIt has got to be fortunate, then, that in this case the characters were able to carry the show, as Nike's hotheadedness and strong emotions (and naisu figurrrre oo yeah) complemented perfectly with Livius' cool and intelligence, with some nice mix-ups as the show progressed. Indeed, the main characters were hard not to like and to back them up there was a lively cast of entertaining side characters, like the trio of comical maids forever trying to stuff Nike into a corset.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was alright, for sure it didn't have to be great for a simple slice-of-life kind of show, with some noticeable poorly-drawn scenes which hinted at a lack of budget, but that's not a big issue for me. Also the rain-calling song is pretty good, and fortunately so because they repeated it like 10 times throughout the anime and you can't exactly skip it like the OP/ED so yeah. Only complaint for the sound was how sometimes the bgm was too overpowering as if purposefully trying to convey the mood. That does not sit well with me as I feel like the voice-acting if done well should be more than enough for convey emotions. Then again, not completely convinced by the performance of either of the seiyuu for the 2 main characters, especially Nikes', but then again somewhat expected as she apparently does not have that much experience, so perhaps the bgm-cover-up was necessary.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, not too bad. Heavy romance isn't really my cup of tea so maybe I would appear to be a little harsh with my final score. \\n",

            "content": "Soredemo Sekai Wa Utsukushii, or The World is Still Beautiful, was absolutely amazing and one of the only anime I enjoyed this spring. It did an outstanding job without expectation. Before this anime came out, I knew it was from a shoujo manga, and I thought it was just going to be decent, in a good way. The first episode made it pretty decent, but as the series continues, each episode grew better. I was so fascinated by the romance, and the songs. The comedy was great too. \r\nStory: 8/10 \r\nThe story is really different than most shoujo anime, there's not only romance and drama,but also actions and plot twists that will keep you wanting more episodes. I'm amused that it's a historical romance anime, I barely seen any of those this year or for a long time, besides Maoyuu Maou Yuusha, that came out 2013. \\n\\n\r\nI love the romance between Nike and Livius, even though that have a huge age and height difference, personalities, and rank in royalty. Whether perfect or not, they can still be beautiful. :) Also there weren't a lot of cliche, intense scenes, which I like about this series.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I don't like about the story is that it's pretty short for the anime. But 12-13 episodes is good enough for a shoujo anime. Also, there wasn't a huge plot, besides the engagement. Overall, there's nothing really wrong for me about the story. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nThe art was incredible as expected. There were some minor issues, but that can be simply ignored and not mattered. Most of the good efforts appears in the love scenes and the Tender Rain song, which I enjoyed the most. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nObviously, I would give it a 10, especially to the opening, ending, and the Tender Rain. Tender Rain was my favorite, it was one of the most beautiful anime songs I ever heard. I cried every time I listen to it. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nI give it an 8 because there weren't really a lot of characters. Most of the characters are supportive, and they didn't put much effort to the series, except for Nike's grandma, Bard, Neil, and Kitora. Nike and Livius are my favorites in this series, as well in spring anime. I agree that Livius can be a brat sometimes, but he's really cool and mature for a kid, and pretty badass. I don't have any complaints about Nike, she's really courageous and brave for a female shoujo protagonist. She has flaws, but I couldn't care much. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10 \\n\r\nI barely have any excuses or complaints about this anime, it's fine the way it is. I enjoyed almost every moment of it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nKeep up with the good work, Kamegaki Hajime, and Studio Pierrot and VAP! Please make a second season by any chance! I would be happier than ever. \\n\\n",

            "content": "You know how romance anime tend to either be way too fast paced or incredibly slow paced? This is something that annoys me very often, but not at all in this case. Soredemo sekai Wa utsukushii is a beautiful, fun and interesting anime that got me hooked from episode one, and by the last episode I longed for more. \r\nOh, and don't worry, it's not pedophilia. Probably. Just ignore that. \r\nStory 9/10: \r\nThe story in this anime may sound boring because of the whole \"adult princess forced to marry young king\" theme that it starts of with, but don't let that fool you! This animehas really well paced romance and character development, and has that little something about it that makes you want to see what happens next. Everything keeps a steady pace so it doesn't have the last-minute kiss kind of development, but a romance that we can clearly see and follow as it grows stronger and more beautiful than a lot of other romance anime that I've watched. \\n\r\nYou would also think that Nike and Livi would look like sister and brother, what with the age difference, but I never once thought they looked like that. From the start they looked like a boy and a girl in a relationship that would start out rough, but was soon to bloom. \\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10: \\n\r\nI can't really say that the art stood out a lot. It looked ordinary, but beautiful, something which fit this anime really well. Sometimes there was a really beautiful scene, then it would go back to the more ordinary style. The character design was very fitting to the different personalities and most of them looked really good. They didn't have any unnecessary, super moe or fan service-ish features to them, with the exception of a few side characters. \\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10: \\n\r\nAh, the music. The instrumental soundtrack mixed very well with the different scenes. It created emotion, smiles, tears and laughter. It wasn't really something I was aware of during the anime, but after listening to the tracks separately, it's really amazing. it's intense, beautiful and a joy to the ears. If you're looking for some serious eargasm, look no further. \\n\r\nThe opening and ending theme is really catchy and beautiful too. The opening has that kind of rhythm to it that makes it hard to sit still and not get chills from the awesome drums and voice. \\n\r\nAlso, Nikes rain-summoning song is just angelic. With a hint of engrish (I misspelled that on purpose) and a beautiful instrumental and vocal harmony, it makes me think of the relaxing sound of falling rain. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10: \\n\r\nThere are very few cardboard clip-out characters in this anime. By that I mean that there wasn't a generic main character, a cute and happy character or any of the typical -dere characters, with the exception of one side character. This is something I'm really happy about. These kind of characters get boring quickly and lowers the enjoyment. \\n\r\nTo start off let's talk about Princess Nike. She is a very strong-willed and brave girl who can never sit still and hates wearing pretty dresses and high heels. Pretty much the exact opposite of a typical princess, a real tomboy. But even though she may seem a little boyish, she is very gentle, likable, has a strong sense of justice and loyalty, and cares for the people around her. Oh, and did I mention that her singing can call forth rain? Now if that isn't awesome, nothing is. \\n\r\nThe only thing I found strange about Nike is that in the first few episodes Nike is dead set on the fact that summoning rain is a sacred ritual and can't be done just on someones whim, yet she calls the rain almost every other episode. A little strange, but doesn't ruin anything. \\n\r\nThen theres the Sun King Livi. This young king may seem angry, strict and unapproachable at first, but when you get to know him he's a sweet and gentle boy who really cares for his country. He works hard and tries his best to be a good king, despite his age. When he starts to care about someone, he doesn't do it half-heartedly, but at the same time you don't want to get on his bad side. \\n\r\nAll the side characters gets their fare share of screen time, but you won't remember most of their names by the end. There are a few bigger side characters that helps the plot along, but the character awesomeness award goes to Nike and Livi, by far. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10: \\n\r\nI absolutely loved this anime. With it's great paced romance, interesting characters and not too over the top settings and story, it's a relaxing, yet interesting anime that kept me smiling, laughing and crying. It does have some action, comedy and drama to it too, so it doesn't make you all depressed, but can be deep when it wants to. It just made me really happy in the end and, though I want a season 2, it isn't really necessary. It left me pleased, and that in itself is an achievement. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10: \\n\r\nThough it does have a few flaws within art, some unnecessary story and a few non-memorable characters, Soredemo sekai Wa utsukushii is a beautiful anime that will leave you smiling, awww-ing, crying and thinking \"despite the almost pedophilia, this anime is amazing!\". Definitely a recommended watch for all romance fans out there. \\n",

Rewatching now, I see the animation is pathetic. Mostly, the characters just stand there as their mouths move. Their bodies do not shift; the scenery does not change; there is absolutely motion. I immediately stopped when 10-15 minutes into episode 2, some random guards had more motion that the MCs. I usually like animations of mangas with music, because I can actually hear the songs, but the manga was much more lively than the anime. The characters may aswell be cardboard cutouts.",

            "content": "The World Is Still Beautiful\r\nArt\r\nI wasn\u2019t really sure how I was going to feel about this art. It seemed really generic and at times I was afraid it might take a turn for the worst. But instead I really just got used to it and I ended up finding it to be rather simple but still elegant. The colors come out really well and there is great contrast at times. I really loved when, in the darker moments of the story, there was a real fear that came about as a result of the way everything had shifted to a darker tone. The other thingI noticed was the amount of animation quirks that make for some kind of comic relief. Personally, I\u2019m not a huge fan of these and I think it was overused here.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is amazing. If they sold this online somewhere I would buy it, it is that good. I absolutely love the pirate style tunes and the shanty type things that you hear as the series opens. The biggest thing it reminded me though, was of the video game series Kingdom Hearts. A lot of the music sounds like it would fit right in at Traverse Town (if you\u2019ve played the game you\u2019ll understand). Another thing I really liked about the music was when Nike\u2019s singing came into play as a part of the story. This really was a great way to include even more music in this show and I think it really paid off in the end. \\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\r\nThe story here is that Princess Nike, of the Rain Dukedom, is sent off to marry the Sun King in the Sun Kingdom, where it never rains. Upon the discovery that the Sun King, Livi, is just a child and has the selfish motive of wanting her to become his play thing (making it rain whenever he pleases as a party favor) she reacts...poorly and Livi throws her in prison. Once she escapes, they begin to have this relationship and Livi starts to learn to see the beauty in the world of the stars, flowers and the earth; rather than all of the harm that it has caused him and the obsession with money and power. Once the King\u2019s true colors come out, their relationship is actually able to grow and flourish and become something that really wasn\u2019t expected.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Reflection\\n\r\n So I was pretty unsure about this show. Almost every show I watch, I go in blind, but for the reasons I stated above I was a little weary on this one. However the more that I watched the better I felt about it. The relationship between Livi and Nike is very much like that of Lawrence and Holo from Spice and Wolf (another great show if you haven\u2019t seen it). But as I grew into the characters I felt them grow into me as well. I wanted to see them get together and have a relationship of true love, because that is what I seek in life. My main gripe with the show was some translation errors (such as the title of the show being translated weird) and there were many episode titles that were off. Now I haven\u2019t decided if that is the studio\u2019s fault or Crunchyroll\u2019s, either way it was annoying. This show gave me a warm fuzzy feeling, but it also was a little rough at times and I decided to watch other things. It didn\u2019t drag me in as some other amazing shows do. But if you need a love story that has drama, singing, and even a few tears, just remember; The World Is Still Beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Rating: 7.5/10\\n",

If you're looking for an anime that focus' more on romance, this is the anime for you! I found this anime really cute! It intrigued me since episode 1. The story also shows some aspects of reality. Especially, in terms of romance.\r\nArt (8/10):\r\nIt was aired on 2014, the art isn't really that great, but it's still pretty! Sure, there are a lot of anime that was aired on 2014 & the art looks amazing, but the story makes up for it. It honestly, really isn'tthat bad.\\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10):\\n\r\nI just really love the OST! This anime is one of the anime's where I like both the opening & ending song.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10/10):\\n\r\nTheir characters are great! I can't really tell what kind of personality Nike has, though. Even though Livius' personality was cliche, I still found it adorable! I'm pretty sure he's a tsundere! I actually got attached to Livi because of his personality & his looks. So kawaii.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10):\\n\r\nOne of the best romance anime's I've ever seen! Not exaggerating, fyi. I actually re-watched this twice, because it was that good. This had me fangirling at 12AM. Yes, I even went to the extremes & rewatched it at 12AM.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (10/10):\\n\r\nThis is one of the best romance anime's I've ever seen. The story may not have much of a plot though it makes you intrigued by events and it focuses on the genres. The art was not so bad, though it could've been better, in my opinion. I really love the OST, it really fits well in the anime & the genres. I never skipped the opening & the ending. The characters, I guess are okay. I couldn't really tell Nike's personality & Livius has a cliche one. Though, I don't really mind. I still love their characters. They are just so adorbs... I rewatched this twice. It's so hard to find an anime with this kind of chemistry & unique plot.",

            "content": "This initial episode sets a nice mood, however the rest of the story fails to really live up to it.  Maybe that's because it was a bit too rushed.  \r\nThe idea of rain summoning through music is an interesting one, and does add some points of interest.  The sound track for these bits was really enjoyable and they did make some emotional connections.\r\nHowever in the end, I found the characters fairly flat and their motivations and backstories felt rushed and lacking.  I feel like it had a good bit of potential, but the story ends up losing its way somewhere.For example, I felt we needed to see more of the character's initial misunderstandings for their relationship to really feel like it had some solid tension.  Also the young king's backstory is emotional, but I felt like it lacked a good bit of depth.  There was some limited attempt to add backstory and detail, but limited number of episodes may have prevented this, or it may have saved us from a bunch of random filler, we'll never know.\\n\\n\r\nYou may find this more enjoyable than I did.  I stuck around for all the episodes because I did like the characters to some degree, and I figured I'd stick it out to see the end given the limited episode count.",

            "content": "Really hoped that this would be another anime which I would enjoy and have fun watching. However, that is not the case. Before you go any further reading this review, it is important that I tell you, I dropped this anime after watching the third episode. Why? The story of this anime did not seem interesting and was not able to capture my attention at all through the first 3 episodes. The romance was lacking and there was not exciting events or subplots to make up for it. If you are a fan of constant talking with no real meaning to the conversations then thisanime is probably for you. Watching this felt like a waste of time to me. I basically forced myself to finish watching at least 3 episodes to see if story would get more interesting, with no luck. It is possible that the story develops later on (similar to steins;gate where the story towards the end of the anime is so much better then the beginning), but seeing that it is a 12 episode anime, the best that could happen is that it gets interesting for the 3 last episodes. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and music included in this anime was fairly good, so nothing to complain about that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you are a person who enjoys hardcore romance or want excitment  when you watch animes, this isn't the one for you.",

Clearly the direction of this anime is to satisfy the hole that the lonely anime viewer experiences.\r\nThe art style is neat and unadventurous, there are no huge fight scenes or tricky trickery to be had. And the story? Typical fish out of water following love story. That said, the character breadth is truly outstanding and I feel that they were wasted in some part. We have two strong and relatable protagonists, Nike and Livi and what a pair these two make.\r\nThe jokes almost flow from each persons predicament, ruined only but the occasional overpowering possessiveness thatLivi sometimes exposes. The drama is dealt with on a episode by episode nature and at the end of the whole mess, if you've bothered to sit through some of the more cringe-worthy scenes, you exit the anime with a slight skip in your heart.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, an entertaining way to pass a weekend or two. You'll wish love was only that easy and perhaps be embolden to greater things, but only for a weekend or two.",
