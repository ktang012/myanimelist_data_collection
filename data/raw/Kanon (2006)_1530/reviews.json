            "content": "A boy named Yuuichi is moving to a town he lived in seven years ago. However, he doesn't remember anything. When living in this town, he meets a lot of girls, all with tragic stories, and he helps them.\r\nSure, the concept sounds like just about any other anime based on a visual novel would be. However, despite several other shows of that type, this actually does remarkably well. \r\nSTORY\r\nWell, to be honest, this show has got to be one of the greater shows I've ever watched, no doubt! The story is just so good it leaves me astonished at times. It starts out as apretty normal show of its genre. You're also introduced to several of the girls, but it doesn't touch upon all their stories at once. There's some comedic moments every now and then.\\n\\n\r\nAt first it might seem like it's just some slice of life series, but the story progresses  a lot from its initial stages, and as you're taken through the individual girls' story arcs, you'll be taken away. It has good a lot of good moments, some romantic, some dramatic. However, just about everything that happens in the story later on will base itself on supernatural elements (mostly miracles), which makes a contrast to the earlier parts of it. That's not really a bad thing though; I at least found it most enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nART\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in the series is really awesome too; the character designs, details in environments and everything just looks awesome. The lighting which you find in many of the afternoon scenes is pure awesomeness too; it really makes the scenes moody; and very dramatic if that's what the scene is about.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Kanon is really awesome. The girls' stories are just awesome to behold, and Yuuichi's own background with them is very intriguing, and it ends up making you wanting to know more about it. The main hero, Yuuichi, is also a very interesting character in his own right. To be short about it; they are awesome and you'll love them (at least one or two of them).\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe music in this anime is really great as well. There's a lot of nice piano themes, so if you enjoy good piano themes you'll definitely enjoy the music in this series. The show's got some good music aside that too, and the OP and ED themes are magnificent.\\n\\n\r\nThere's nothing to say on the sounds aside the music, and the seiyuu do a great job on their roles; the characters' voices are very good.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this is a lovely anime, a true masterpiece. If you like anime series based on visual novels, you'll enjoy this. If you haven't watched any anime series of that kind, watch it anyway, because you'll love it.\\n\\n\r\nTo 'Not Helpful' voters (and you 'Helpful' voters too): Feedback greatly appreciated =)",

            "content": "This was a series that allowed my emotions to run wild. Each of the characters is presented with their own tragic tale of the past. Even the supernatural and fantasy elements are carefully intertwined in the story in such a way that it does not stick out. This is truly an excellent series.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nThe development starts out rather slow and silly and can get a bit dull. I was on a hiatus with this series for almost half a year before I started watching again. It is set up like a harem series, but it is different from them, which sets it apart from otherharem series. It is not a harem in a story; it is a story with a harem. There is a difference, and Kanon does it extremely well. Look at all the anime out there. Many of them have similar plots, but what makes some better than others? The execution of the story, and this is where Kanon shines. There is a constant air of mystery behind everything: the characters, the setting, the season, and so forth. The story is emotional, dramatic, and even light-hearted at times. With this nice blend, a seemingly simple story of a new boy surrounded by a group of girls becomes a unique tale. The only major problem was that when one of the girl's arc ended, they completely disappeared in another character's arc. This style feels way too much like a visual novel, and lacks blending and character interaction.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThere is not much to say about the art and animation when it is done by Kyoto Animations because most of it is a regurgitation of what other fans have already said: absolutely amazing, gorgeous, and stunning. The setting and season of winter are extremely well drawn so that it puts the viewers into that setting. Falling snow has never look so good in an anime until now. It does not just fall; it falls in a way that I could watch it forever. The art style, though it's very clear, colorful and crisp, is a bit generic. The designs are of the eyes, a staple in these types of stories, were a bit too large and I did not like.\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\\n\r\nAh, canon, canon, Kanon. There are reasons why this series is called that, and one of the more obvious reasons is the presence of Pachelbel's Canon in D Major. Such a lovely piece, especially for one who has already played it. Besides that, the music complements the mood very nicely. When things get dramatic and sad, it is the music that allows those tears to run free. Although I did not find any one track that stood out for me (except for well, the obvious one) the music was nice and fitting. It would not be a soundtrack that I would listen to without the anime playing though. The voice acting was also very good, although every time Yuuichi opened his mouth, I immediately thought of Kyon. It does not help that those two look uncannily similar.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this series were a bit generic but that's not necessarily a bad thing with the right development and execution. They did all have their mysteries, problems and development. Every character, from the first time they appear on screen, seems to have a mysterious side. Each of them are different and stands out. And Yuuichi is such an awesome lead. He can be a bit insensitive and playful at times, but he truly is a nice guy and it's not surprising that he's so well liked among the girls. The major downside in this series is the lack of interaction among the girls. Once a girls' story arc is done, they aren't really seen all that much until the end. It would have fleshed out their characters more if they interacted more.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime all right; enjoyed it to the point I cried through episodes nonstop. It might have also been the fact that I marathoned three or four episode at once, so the water works just seemed to never stop. There were times where I laughed out loud, times where I cheered (the ending), and many times where I bawled my eyes out.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed this series immensely. It has a touch of everything: drama, comedy, supernatural elements and so forth. I thought it was a very enjoyable series despite its flaws. 8/10",

            "content": "Kanon is the the last of the Kyoto Animation animated Key visual novels that I had to see. Somehow I'd managed to watch all of Clannad, Clannad After Story and Air. While writing staff and directing staff differ slightly with each iteration, there's an incredibly clear singular style between each anime. It's a style that with each series of theirs I watch, and those inspired by its nakige formula such as Ano Hana, I can increasingly see the strings for. Strings that are made from the bloodied remains of mentally deficient little girls killed mercilessly and dangled limply from the fingers of Key writer JunMaeda as he coos \"who's now the perfect image of a woman, yes you are, yes you are\".\\n\\n\r\nHere is the general outline for a Key story arc. First you introduce a little girl. She is supposedly a teenager the same age as our asshole lead male character. However at every single turn we are establishing how childlike they are. They look 6 years old, they act like they\u2019re 6 years old, the male lead constantly treats them like they\u2019re 6 years old and outright tells them they might as well be 6 years old. Each girl has their own little quip that in one girl\u2019s case might as well be her saying \u201cgoo goo\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nThey are also depicted as fragile and weak and needing your attention. A bunch of them are in the slow process of dying, either through poorly explained illnesses or magical illnesses. They\u2019re emotionally fragile and with each arc fall apart in their own ways. One girl in particular has her own rotary functions and general maturity, what little of it there was, stripped away from her. The reasons for this shift usually comes straight out of the writer\u2019s backsides, such as a character\u2019s mum getting randomly hit by a car because we needed little girls to be more emotionally unstable.\\n\\n\r\nTheir emotional instability and life view all appears to come from when the girls were 6 years old (as in actually on this planet for 6 years, not just emotionally 6 years old). The childhood promise is the most powerful force in the world of Kanon, capable of raising the dead and conjuring ghosts. According to the world of Kanon, all relationships are born from before the age of 6 and everyone you meet since then might as well not exist. Nearly all the girls in Kanon are desperately trying to get back to the relationship they had with the male character from when they were 6.\\n\\n\r\nYou get the uncomfortable feeling that the writers believe that the 6 year old mindframe for women is the ideal. Not just so you can comfort them as they slowly die, but from a romantic standpoint too, and whenever you try to strip them off this childlike state the show punishes them for it. Kanon operates on horror movie logic where as soon as a girl displays anything resembling romantic feelings it gets stripped from them. Even if their romantic feelings come from a desire to just be together with someone because they\u2019re lonely, as soon as anything resembling romance happens is when the show starts killing them.\\n\\n\r\nThat is this nakige formula. Key aren't the only people who do it, but they\u2019re certainly the most famous. Bring in a female character. Make the male lead belittle her in s\u2019life segments for her immaturity so he can establish his place as above her. Reveal that she may have romantic feelings for her. Then strip the girl of any independence either physically or emotionally and then usually kill her.\\n\\n\r\nNormally a reviewer will say that the worst thing a piece of entertainment\u2019s can do is be boring, but that\u2019s not Kanon\u2019s problem. Certainly it is mind-blowingly boring since practically all the humour and conversations consist of a girl with no mental capacity being told by the main character how stupid she is. But the real reason I hate Kanon so much is the bits after that. The rinse and repeat of taking a little girl, stripping her of all agency and then killing her in order to draw tears from the audience, who invariably fall for it each and every time.\\n\\n\r\nNot that I blame you. The same way I don\u2019t blame people for clicking on buzzfeed clickbait articles on web advertising. They are designed in that insidious way to get you to click on them, and its only once you realise that do you stop supporting this \u201cYou Won\u2019t Believe These 8 Ways Miley Cyrus Hates Minecraft Pokemon\u201d headlines by not clicking on them. I know you think Kanon, Clannad and Air are emotional because they made you cry, but punching you in the face and breaking your nose would probably make you cry too. That doesn\u2019t make the punch a 10/10 emotional piece of high entertainment. All they are doing are taking weak creatures and killing them to draw a reaction from you. Stop falling for it. Please.",

            "content": "There is something very wrong with Key. It shows in most of their stories, but nowhere is it as obvious as in Kanon. It is a problem shared throughout the otaku industry, but once again, in Kanon it is more clear than anywhere else.\r\nThe problem seems to be a severe emotional immaturity and a nearly pathological fear of women. In Kanon, this influences nearly every female character: They are, through numerous contrivances, designed to be as non-threatening as possible. They are either so retarded that they would have no chance to function in society except by fiat of the writers, or not human, or otherwisedysfunctional and immature.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character, in turn, manages to fumble his way through the story without ever forming any kind of meaningful, human relationship with any of them, never feeling anything deeper for them than the affection one might feel for a pet, or the grief one would feel at the loss of a pet. This is even true in a literal sense for one of the poor girls, who turns out to actually be a pet.\\n\\n\r\nNone of it feels real in any way. It is a shallow fantasy, written by emotionally stunted people. It depicts a desire for human contact devoid of any risk of being hurt, or deeply affected in any way. It is really quire disturbing to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is, in a purely technical sense, very beautiful - Kyoto Animation are masters at their craft, and the art is wonderful and the direction tight. But the core of the story is rotten, and no amount of dress-up can change that.",

            "content": "Animation - 6\r\nIt' the same character design as we've all seen in Air and Clannad.  Big, glassy eyes, with proportionately large tears.  It's nothing new, but it is polished.  Animation wise, it's what we know of from Key.  Hair whipping through snow, blades of grass, and orbs of light.  No striking animation sequences, or dynamic animation at all except for a fight that Mei gets into, but nothing special.\r\nSound - 6\r\nKannon is rife with pseudo-ambient music and music box themes that would make Enya decry the milquetoastness of it all.  The opening and ending are forgettably familiar.  Therewas one good jazzy piano piece that seemed to show up when an obstacle was revealed that was quite good.  If only the rest of the music had that charm and added that much texture.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 4\\n\r\nAs has been said these characters are stock.  We've seen them all, the sick girl, the loli, the comedy duo, the rich girl, the blond-only-other-guy-in-the-whole-show, the relative with a crush, and on and on.  It's all so bland.  Mei (quiet girl), gets it right, Yuuichi (the main character) is a weak person that pretends to be strong, hurting everyone around him without a modicum of self awareness.  His selfishness disguised as selflessness knows no bounds and no one ever dares to call him out on it.  In fact, everyone loves him for it.  This phenomena results in the show having no character development for the main character at all.  In fact, I only think that one character &quot;develops&quot; and it was just her behavior suddenly changing.  Shiori's (sick girl) lack of knowing  the name of what's ailing her is the main example of  the lack of thought and depth that writers put in characters.  Of course, they only want viewers to shed tears, so the most superficial of characters is all that's needed if they can make you cry, right?\\n\\n\r\nStory - 4\\n\r\nWrong.  If Kanon were a horror story, more would make sense, because, just like every other Key series, Kanon systematically tries to murder every focus character in the male protagonists' Messiah Complex wake.  Except that  they don't even have the ball to stick to a single death in the show;  moments later the writing backtracks (once it scored the tears from viewers hearts) and magically brings characters back to life.\\n\\n\r\nIf I took this show seriously, I would think that this was some horrible misogynistic fantasy about a boy who is the only person capable of saving all these girls lives within the span of what?  Two months?  Once Yuuichi has saved the girl of the arc, we don't hear of them ever again until the end when, of course, we have to have the pussy parade to show how much the protagonist has accomplished.  Kanon is the worst offender in the Key series of trying to have some pseudo-metaphysical lore intertwine with the plot in that it directly affects these characters in the most mindboggling plot twists.  Faith healers, fox spirits, girls with magical wishes?  Furthermore, the overall plot development is set aside for the gir of the arc stories so that, by the last four or five episode they try, in futility to make the story work.   \\n\r\nTo confess, accept and lose someone you love all in the same episode, without any buildup whatsoever, what is that supposed to do?  Am I supposed to feel bad?  The writing doesn't let characters organically grow with one another in exchange for the &quot;mystery&quot; factor so that, once the leads are together, you ask yourself,   What makes her more special than the others?...you forgot about all of these girls, and didn't remember them until it was too late.  It's the same with her.  Why is she special?  Ridiculous.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 3\\n\r\nSo Kanon left a bad taste in my mouth.  I actively avoided this show, because I already knew what was going to happen once I read the synopsis, and guess what?  I was right.  I couldn't even get behind the one character that I should have liked, Jun, because he was so randomly placed, and had little impact on the story.  If anything, I had to drop my score of Clannad, because whatever originality I saw in it vaporized the moment I completed this show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 4\\n\r\nIn the show, the writers try to draw a comparison between Kanon and Pachabel's Canon in D.  If only Kanon could be so groundbreaking; instead it comes off as merely derivative and uninspired.  It is clear that Kanon was a testing ground of ideas, characters and setting for the more thematically tight (if also anemic) Air and Clannad.  Kannon forgoes plot, character, and logical development for trite gimmicks intended for the emotionally immature to shed tears of empathy, leaving the show  is thematically vacant and lacking ambition.",

It is on borderline with 10 though.\\n\\n\r\n&bull; Art -  The Art was a 10 for me, It is has incredible graphics that will not let you down. Its perfect, the surroundings look amazing and the city is like it was real! I have nothing negative to say about the graphics and Art.\\n\\n\r\n&bull; Sound -  The sound for this Anime has earned a 10. I absolutely loved the sounds and music this Anime had to offer. Again, nothing bad to say about in the category. You will not be disappointed.\\n\\n\r\n&bull; Character -  The Characters in this anime are seriously a 10. The characters in this Anime are all unique in their own ways and not to mention cute. very nice and yet again nothing horrible to say here.\\n\\n\r\n&bull; Enjoyment -  this Anime deserves a 10 because I completly enjoyed this anime, even though it had sad, happy, angry, scary moments. This has to have been one of my most enjoyed Anime's I have ever watched before.\\n\\n\r\n&bull; Overall -  The overall score i gave this anime is seriously a 10. It deserved this score because of how much i loved it and I thought everything about it was just incredible!",

            "content": "This is by far one of the most moving, heart-wrenching, and dramatic anime series I have ever watched.  It's earned a special place in my heart and I will undoubtedly buy the DVDs as well.  Everything from the story, the characters, settings and re-occuring themes within Kanon reverberate with passion and drama; a kind of quality that is hardly ever seen in most anime, yet not only have they accomplished such a feat but have raised the bar for everyone else wanting to make a lasting and memorable masterpiece.\r\nThemes of lost love, death, sickness, and the supernatural constantly propel the story forward forall of the characters, and heightened moments of tension between the male lead and the female characters create an unmatched and unrivaled level of drama with deep backstories and development.  \\n\\n\r\nAs the story pulls you into the world of Kanon, the anime presents itself in an almost mundane, slice-of-life approach that helps you to get associated with the characters.  After the setting and theme has been established, you begin to feel for these characters and to sympathize with them as the story begins to delve more into their past and what kind of stories relate to them.  Then the story makes a huge and unpredictable plot twist that turns Kanon into a nonstop rollercoaster ride that will have you glued to your seat until the very last episode.\\n\\n\r\nEach of the characters have amazingly unique and original storyline arcs , and at least one (if not all of them) is going to be a guaranteed tear jerker.  What's more impressive is how each story arc ties itself together into a main story making it feel extremely cohesive and smooth rather than disconjoined and random.\\n\\n\r\nAs per KEY's style of storytelling, the anime is heavily prevalent with storybook-style lore and magic.  This type of theme can be noticed in other types of anime in the same genre, however the means by which they use this setting along with the amazing characters and unique story help elevate the experience further rather than dampen it.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are into any form of romantic dramas, or are looking for something refreshingly unique, or something that will make you cry, or if you just want to simply enjoy a breathtakingly moving story that will leave a lasting impression on you, Kanon is a must watch if not a must BUY.\\n",

            "content": "Story:\r\nThis is by far the best storyline i have seen out of all the anime i have seen. The unique side stories between the female protagonists were deeply touching and even made my cry on every single one. Unlike a lot of anime it really showed the slice of life side of things, it hinted a minority of fantasy which was revealed fairly early on into the story. I'm going to give this a 10. \r\nArt:\r\nI must say that a good storyline and excellent artwork is rare to find in any anime, but in Kanon they got those two just right, not too realistic, nottoo cartoony, but a perfect balance in my eyes. The movement of the characters themselves were a very good pointer but the main attraction to the artwork would have to be the environmental side of things, the scenery of the forest, the city and everything else were just fantastic. 10 for this aswell.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nBoth the opening and ending themes to this anime were good, as the story progressed and more and more information about the characters were revealed the songs seemed to be more touching, as the video to it showed clips of the characters in actions, somehow reminding me of their stories. The voice actors chosen for this were just right. Aya especially, her voice was so cute and fit the character most impressively from the rest. Another 10 for this also.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nFrom my previous points you can probably already tell what i'm going to say.. the characters were brilliantly done, and the anime would be 100% ruined without any of them in. Each and every character were different in their own way, and fitted the character setting and stories behind them. I'd have to say Mai was a personal favourite, as she was brilliantly done. Another 10 for this aswell.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment factor of this anime was amazing, some bits of it were funny, whilst others were deeply heart-touching. I liked this element of the anime, as it's totally different from anything i've ever seen (I don't think i've cried like that for a very long time). So i'd have to give this a 10, as it's my favourite anime yet, and until another 'Miracle' happens, it will always stay to be as far as i'm concerned.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall i'd have to give this anime a 10/10. Theres not much more i can say apart from if you haven't watched this, i definately suggest it. It's more realistic than any other anime, with a hint of fantasy which works very well mixed in it. \\n\\n\r\nI hope this review was helpful, thanks.\\n\\n\r\nAyu-Ayu",

            "content": "For an amazing anime it had way too many flaws. I loved the characters, the story behind them and the emotions conveyed throughout the entirety of the anime. But to be honest with you there was a lot of wrong with this anime, such as how a lot of the things introduced in this anime made no sense and it was clear that the writers didn't want it to.\r\nMakoto's story arc has to be the one I love the most. She was a great character to begin with and just like Kaori she actually felt like a normal girl, but that slowly changed for betterand for worse. We also had involvement of a character named Amano where her role was to help guide Yuuichi on how to deal with the problem that was facing Makoto and Yuuichi, as she had experienced this 'miracle' before.\\n\\n\r\nAfter Yuuichi had learnt the truth, Makoto became more and more child-like, in the sense of an innocent child. She lost the ability to use her hands properly and slowly lost her ability to speak; she could only say \"Auu~\" after that. Because of this Yuuichi had to spend more time with her making her happy and showing her that he'll never leave again. During those moments, the events that followed and the music that was playing worked so well together making us adore her even more. As the viewer, we already know she is going to die so having these scenes only make the departure more depressing. Not only that but twice has the Makoto survived a fever and a sleep which brings us a sense of hope, false hope.\\n\\n\r\nEven though I cried because of this arc, the other arcs didn't do much to me. It was all because this arc had me invested and actually made sense. Ignoring the fact that she is one of the children who are Youko, this felt very realistic.\\n\\n\r\nI will not go over any of the major flaws, mostly because this will end up being a rant but partly because I forgot most of them as I've seen it done too much in other anime.\\n\\n\r\nFor a modernised '90s artwork, it looks amazing. I watched a few minutes of the '02 version of the anime and found that it was quite hard to watch, and the girls looked a lot more human in this version. Might I add Yuuichi had a complete redraw while the girls were simply updated. The backgrounds were beautiful but wasn't anything special. As I mentioned above, the background music is always working well with what is appearing on-screen and it was able to easily bring more emotion out of me as well as sounding pretty good. Also the OP and ED suited this anime very well, it showed that it was a generic love story with no real goal.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I loved the show and most of the characters as well as being interested in them, but the complexity of this anime can only go so far, however being the analytical person I am (even if I don't type them down) the flaws ruin it for me.",

            "content": "Kanon (2006) is a great Supernatural, Romance, Comedy, Drama about a boy named Yuichi Aizawa who goes to live with his cousin and aunt after not visiting them for 7 years. For some reason he has he has blocked of a part of his memories from 7 years ago but he begins to recall some of his memories, as meets some familiar faces.\r\nThis is a very well-written story which starts off developing at a leisurely pace, only introducing the characters and their surroundings. It isn't until a couple episodes in when the true story surfaces, with its intriguing plot. There's only one overall plot whichcan only be described in three words, &quot;Dreams, Miracles &amp; Memories&quot; and it's really how this all has affected the different girls that the male protagonist, Yuichi Aizawa, has encountered. It's really interesting because you never know what to expect since all the girls emit a sweet aroma of mystery.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of this anime are a major aspect to the story and because it is based on a visual novel, then there are a lot of cute girls. Although just like similar anime series like &quot;Air&quot; you can expect the girls to have the typical personalities however they are each well developed in their own way. It is really just the male protagonist that stands out from the rest and it's thanks to the performance his voice actor that Yuichi is brought to life, through his emotions and witty comments.\\n\\n\r\nJust like any &quot;Kyoto Animation&quot; production, the animation is beautifully perfect and cannot be topped. If you've seen &quot;Air&quot;, &quot;The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya&quot; or &quot;Full Metal Panic &ndash; TSR&quot; then you'll know what to expect; cute well-drawn girls, dynamic environments and fluid movements. The music is also something that helps the show, with some nice sweet melodies that go well with every situation.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this has to be one of the best romance anime series, based on a visual novel, because even with a weak plot the stories were still amazing. This anime is mostly full of cute and hilarious moments but in between all that there's plenty of tear-jerking drama, romance and even action to be satisfied with.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend this series to anyone who loves Kyoto Animation productions, or isn't afraid to show their emotions because you'll need a box of tissues for this series.\\n\r\n^_^",

            "content": "Kanon(2006) will give you a warm feeling, but the lack of character's depth and the slow story can make you turn away from it.\r\nNote: I'll stop saying Kanon(2006) and say Kanon instead, you get the point.\r\nThe story in Kanon is based around a guy related with girls. Somehow this guy suffers from amnesia, which I never knew why. He can't remember any of the past relations he had with them seven years ago. What stroked me the most is that for a 24 episodes show, it was slow. If you're not a fan of stories that graduate so slowly that you don't know where it'sgetting, and then Kanon is probably something you won't watch. However, Kanon like any other series from Key has this little touch of magic that gives you a warm feeling, so it's not a useless story after all. As for Key animations, they are probably good at shiting you with the reality of life, Kanon is no exception there. Sadly, the way Kanon is told, you would never get the build up of a strong relationship between characters, except between Mai and Yuuichi. Mai is probably the only female lead who doesn't \"disappear\". In summary, the story is light, nothing outstanding but nothing too bad.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is probably mostly annoying in the art are the girls. They all look innocent, have the same small mouth, the same face and the huge eyes. I'll tell you now, I'm not a fan of the huge eyes, and in this term, Kanon delivers. You love them? Go watch Kanon now. Still, I loved the backgrounds, the city of snow, the lighting. If you forget the characters, I\u2019d probably give art a 9.5/10.\\n\\n\r\nWhat do you get with innocent looking girls? Yes, you mostly get an annoying voice cast. I probably got tired of \" UGUUUUUUUU\" after the 10th time(which I believe was the first episode). As for the music, it goes well with the mood. Listening to Kanon music would probably make you depressive. IT IS a depressive show after all.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said in my introduction, Kanon strongly lack in character's depth. What I mean by \"lack\", I totally mean that the characters are flat. Not only the girls all look innocent, they actually act innocent for most of them. Their characteristic makes the show hard to watch, as there is not enough. However, they all have this mysterious and secret past that will hold you on watching the show only for the reason of knowing it. I'll give a thumbs to Key for this, now that's what I call marketing. Anyway, the show didn't have a strong variation of characters, that's why someone would probably think they're all the same.\\n\\n\r\nAfter all these mix of good and bad things, I can say that I actually enjoyed Kanon more than I hated it. Yes, the long moments of silence, the slow story and the flat characters is what I hated it, but you'd still get this mix of sad and happy feeling after watching it. Like most of key's animations, Kanon is a form of relaxation. You won't get any suspense, strong drama, big tragedies, but you'll feel relaxed.\\n",

            "content": "A bit disappointing, but not bad. (BTW, There are a few spoilers)\r\nEveryone seemed to have a really good opinion of Kanon 2006, so I expected the most out of it. I was left a bit dissatisfied, but was entertained nonetheless.\r\nI had a totally different idea about it before I started watching it. I thought it was going to be an anime about normal, run-of-the-mill anime people, but this is KyoAni after all. There were times when my jaw would just drop and my shoulders would shrug, connoting I didn&rsquo;t understand some details, but I did pick up its essence in the end. It was almostlike a roller coaster ride for me, except when it went down it didn&rsquo;t go so low. It had a lot of good points too; believe me when I say I got teary eyed during the last 2 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nIt also bothered me how quickly the characters would adapt to their current situation. They would cross paths with a fox which turned into a human, the spirit of a girl in comatose, a girl battling her own demons and many other weird characters, and yet they would immerse themselves in their daily lives as if nothing happened. It is anime world, after all.\\n\\n\r\nDespite their individual eccentricities, the characters were actually likable. I sympathize with the girls, and I even feared that another one would disappear after Makoto. Makoto was my favorite, I especially found her to be cute when she started to lose her human self, then Shiori, then Mai. Kyon, no, Yuiichi was also a very interesting character. He&rsquo;s mostly responsible for every chuckle and cackle I would make each episode, it&rsquo;s almost like TMoHS all over again.\\n\\n\r\nNow that I mentioned Kyon, how great is it to have Tomokazu Sugita on board? He&rsquo;s my favorite male seiyuu so far, being part of 2 other series I like, namely Honey and Clover and TMoHS of course. There&rsquo;s also the cameo of Maaya Sakamoto, my favorite female seiyuu, which made this anime sweeter for me &ndash; although she did portray a character I hated at first. Yui Horie is another name that got me. Shall we say ~uguu? Let&rsquo;s add an ~auu, ~nyuu and ~ahaha to that as well.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation is just top notch, and this is one of the most notable differences between the original Kanon and Kanon 2006. Kanon 2006 looked much more detailed (but not in a way that will strain your eyes), the characters were revamped and the backgrounds were very stunning. Plus there&rsquo;s the CG too. The CG was just breathtaking &ndash; it complimented the scenes very well, and it was of high quality.\\n\\n\r\nI wish I can say I like the music, but I found it a bit too dreary for me. Sometimes I felt like falling asleep to the opening song. I&rsquo;m not saying I hate it, I did find myself singing along whenever the OP/ED would start playing, but I wish the music was something that I liked more. The feel was very dramatic, the kind you would see in really sad shojo anime, but in a way, it does fit the theme of the anime. Also, I find that the music is well made, but again, it&rsquo;s not for me. Props for using Disney&rsquo;s Sleeping Beauty theme in episode 12. It&rsquo;s one of my favorite Disney songs.\\n\\n\r\nDon&rsquo;t you just love when there&rsquo;s little to none fanservice? I think the only hint of fan service I found was in the first episode, when Nayuki was changing her clothes. I&rsquo;m sure there were more, but they were probably not too vulgar that I didn&rsquo;t notice. It&rsquo;s quite surprising, actually. My initial thought was that Kanon 2006 would be one of those typical harem anime series, but again, it&rsquo;s KyoAni after all.\\n\\n\r\nFor making a viable remake, I&rsquo;d give Kanon 2006 a perfect 10. For entertaining me? I&rsquo;d say 7-8ish.",

            "content": "[Adapted From Original Blog Post]\r\nI\u2019ve never been extremely fond of the whole slice of life/drama series in anime. From where I stand they seem like boring, by-the-book series that never go anywhere, do anything, and have a main character that is as interesting as a window curtain. This in mind, when I go into such series, there\u2019s a certain bit of apprehension, or dread if you will, cause I know that it will be about 50% walking around at school and 45% drama that has no substance.\r\nThis doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019ve never enjoyed a slice-of-life(Clannad, SNAFU, School Days(joking)) but when I first looked at Kanon, Ijust felt the urge to laugh. A series based of a Key Visual Novel adapted by Kyoto Animation, that has 5 equally adorable girls on the cover? Right, think I got this. There\u2019s going to be some boring bloke who has some reason to be new to the setting, there\u2019s going to be one girl who has the personality and emotional capacity of a certain Evangelion character, there\u2019s going to be another girl who looks and acts about 5, and the entire cast has some kind of dark past or trauma that will rear its ugly head by the end of the series. Granted, I did get that, but it\u2019s not as straight forward as it seems. \\n\\n\r\nLets begin with our protagonist: Yuichi Aizawa, the teenager who has just moved back to a city where he spent like two weeks staying with his aunt and cousin, in order to go to school there. He actually pretty normal, but the one thing he has going for him is massive snark. He reminds me vividly of The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya\u2019s Kyon, only without the ability to occasionally keep his mouth shut. He always seems to have something to say about everyone and everything, and this wit is what drives the shows comedy. It\u2019s actually pretty funny too, and that\u2019s good, cause bland comedy and repetition get along like a toe and hangnail. Despite this, Yuichi proves multiple times that he actually cares a lot for other people, and will do anything for anybody who thinks needs his help. I really like his character, and he makes a great protagonist for the show.\\n\\n\r\nNext up is our \u201cmain girl\u201d Ayu Tsukimiya, the aforementioned 5yr old looking girl. She tends to be in the center of whatever is happening, acting like a sidekick for Yuichi and helping him with his problems. Since the show follows an ark format, this allows her to be always in the background while we concentrate on a certain girl, but always in the show. This builds a lot to her, and is crucial for the show\u2019s final ark, which just so happens to be about her. She\u2019s an eccentric and overly optimistic girl, but of course she has a dark past that shapes why she acts the way she does. Actually she\u2019s not quite as well rounded as some of the other characters on the show, but she\u2019s clearly the one the show wants to focus on. It\u2019s like being told to watch grass grow while a giant panda is floating in the sky behind you, firing gamma rays from its mouth. Yes I cared what happened to her by the end, but I can\u2019t help but feel that might be due more of the time I spent watching her than actually character likability and complexity. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the supporting cast is ridiculously strong, each with their own backstory and screen time. While I can\u2019t talk about them all, keep watch for the Misaki sisters, who probably had the best developed ark in the show, Makato Sawatari, an unassumingly complex girl whose arc came the closest to making me shed a tear, and Minase Nayuki, Yuichi\u2019s cousin, who is really hard to wake up in the morning. I\u2019m glad the show was able to build such strong characters, since the plot certainly isn\u2019t going to get of its ass and help forward the narrative is it? Character driven is something you could use to describe Kanon, and in my book, that\u2019s a good thing. \\n\\n\r\nNow the biggest problem I have with these kind of shows usually is the way they handle drama. What I hate, and what these shows usually do, is put drama in there for the sake of it. For example, I\u2019ll cry because a puppy died, yes, but it actually takes a good show for me to cry because I liked that puppy. I knew its motivations and personality; its fears and dreams, and I can see how it all built up to the event. See what I mean? It\u2019s easy to have a tragic backstory, but it\u2019s harder to make the viewer truly care. Luckily, with Kanon they avoid this problem, and whatever empathy or sadness I felt for the characters, it was because they were well built, not for the sake of it. While some characters lack true depth, I really don\u2019t have a problem with any of them. \\n\\n\r\nIf there\u2019s one thing I didn\u2019t lack how the show handled, it was the supernatural part of it. It just seemed like something thrown in there to increase the drama; because apart from when it was important to the plot, everything is typical slice-of-life. Now, the supernatural elements were OK in a anime like Clannad because they were used sparingly, just enough to give the show a sense of wonder(besides from that bullsh*t ending) but in Kanon they don\u2019t seem to really have a reason for it. OK Kanon, the fox girl I can buy, but by the time demons and ghosts are showing up, my tolerance is waning. If they wanted a supernatural theme, just make it an integral part of the show, not a catalyst for drama escalation! But I digress. \\n\\n\\n\r\n\tThe music for Kanon is really quite average. While it provides really nice ambience for the series, especially during the emotional bits, nothing here really is worth listening to on your own. As for animation, Kyoto Animation did a fantastic job. While character design in nothing of the beaten track(though that is probably more the visual novels fault more than Kyoto Ani\u2019s) the animation is lovely and high quality, as expected from this certain production studio.\\n\\n\r\n\tWhile not great, Kanon is still well worth your time if you\u2019re looking for a character driven drama. It\u2019s emotional, funny, and if you\u2019re suffering from a void from finishing your new favorite slice-of-life, probably one of the first things you should pick up. I didn\u2019t cover everything, like the lack of cohesion between the story arcs, or the amount of convenience that Yuichi would meet all these girls and make such a big impact that they would remember him like a decade later all in the span of this one visit to his aunt, but I\u2019m not going to fixate on it too much. It\u2019s good, you should watch it, and if you don\u2019t have a soul as black and dead as I do, you might just shed a tear or two. Till next time.\\n\\n\r\n\tFinal Verdict: 7(.5)/10\\n\\n\r\n\tP.S: So wait, she just recovered from that illness at the end without any explanation? Oh, nevermind.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFor this review and others, feel free to check out my blog! (Link on profile)\\n",

            "content": "Watching Kanon among all the hentai game adaptations like being dragged  to your grandma's dance party being shocked that it ain't bad.\r\nErotic visual novels... or Hentai games are they're better known, are not exactly  Shakespearean work. They typically feature some hopeless wuss boy, with way too much porno magazines under his bed and and a nose that donates vast amounts of blood whenever he seems some cleavage that's vaguely PG-13.\r\nAnd yet, for some unfathomable reason, this same hopeless guy would not only the object to sexual desire for a hot girl of every archetype, but also the school teacher (who happens to havevery large breasts), and his kid sister (who looks like they'll only hit puberty in the year 2099). Needless to say, Anime adaptations of such visual novels are generally not aimed for the Oscars.\\n\\n\r\nKanon, while not perfect,  is an unexpected gem that breaks all such traditions.\\n\\n\r\nSure, there's still a guy, Yuuichi, surrounded by many cute adoring girls. But for once, this is guy that actually *deserves* to be adored.  The dialogue in Kanon oozes with charm, and  Yuuichi is the master at cynical humour. Mix this with a dash of selflessness, and you've got a guy that you can actually see girls getting attracted to. For once, for the guys out there, this is probably one the only harem animes might improve your interactions with the opposite gender when you watch it.\\n\\n\r\nThis, combined with stunning visuals, a slow but serene soundtrack, a cast of memorable female characters, each with a story that can potentially bring out a tear, makes Kanon reign supreme as the king of animes featuring 5 different beautiful women adoring one man.\\n\\n\r\nAnd there lies Kanon's more problem... at its heart, it is still an adaptation of a hentai game. In these games, a player would make decisions, and end up with one girl. Once the girl's decided, there's very little interaction with any other. The anime adaptation attempts to details the story of every girl, and thus comes across as being a little disjointed. \\n\\n\r\nWhenever the story of one girl ends, she mysteriously vanishes from the series, as if the director fired the actor on the spot. What's more, with every girl pouring their heart out for Yuuichi, and squealing at the chance for a date, you would think that they'd get a little upset when he ends up with someone else. I'm not talking about school days here, but everyone getting along happily like 5 overly cute puppies around their master is a little far stretched.\\n\\n\r\nDespite this gripe, which in fairness, us hard to avoid. Kannon delivers. Not only is this the cream of hentai game adaptations, its also an hentai game adaptation that you can use to introduce a girl to anime, without them making up excuses like having to go dancing with their grandma the next time you meet.\\n",

            "content": "**SPOILER FREE REVIEW**\r\nKanon (2006) is one of the most beloved shoujo anime of all time; fans describe it as a touching, devastatingly sad storyline with memorable characters that make for a \"life-changing\" experience. It is highly regarded as a masterpiece that could make just about anyone cry. Well, long story short, Kanon didn't even come close to fulfilling that criteria for me thanks to one simple reason; nothing in this anime is relatable, believable, or genuine by any stretch of the imagination. This show demonstrates a complete misunderstanding of the very fundamental nature of human relationships, most notably the concept love. Rather then spilt thisreview into story, characters, sound, and art, I'm just going to go straight for why I didn't like this anime:\\n\\n\r\nThe\u00a0first problem is the characters. I don't know why the writer felt the need to write the female characters in such a way, but they are all the intellectual equivalents of a severely mentally handicapped person. Two of them in particular are so inept and immature that they literally cannot function as human beings without significant amounts of help. It gets so bad that at one point, one of the girls needs the protagonist, Yuuichi, to f*cking FEED her. Seriously. FEED her.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are unable to realize why that is a major problem, I'll go ahead and tell you: it's a major problem because this unrealistic sense of dependence and immaturity prevents Yuuichi from ever forming a normal, human relationship with any of the characters! The affection that Yuuichi develops for the other characters is comparable to the feelings you might have for a dog or cat; certainly not a human being (that turns out to be shockingly accurate for one character, haha). None of the connections between the characters feel meaningful or emotional in anyway because of how obnoxiously unrealistic the females are. Only one of them does not fall into this trap, and that one is a cardboard cut-out Yuki Nagato/Rei Ayanami clone who is completely devoid of any personality what so ever.\\n\\n\r\nThe second problem is the plot twists/major plot events. Kanon continued with it's theme of being unrealistic and unrelatable by drawing all of it's \"sad\" and \"emotional\" plot twists from sudden, tragic events that don't actually happen in real life! I can't go into detail about what these \"twists\" are, but lets just say they are poorly explained, they come out of nowhere, and they are completely fictional/supernatural.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nAgain, if you are unable to understand why this is a problem, I will explain again: If you are going to attempt to tell a love story or a story about friendship with the goal of making people sad because a tragic event happens, that only works if the tragic event is something believable that the viewer can relate to their real life! The reason that tragic moments in anime like the final story arc of Clannad: After Story worked and were legitimately sad was because the characters were relatable and the tragedies/plot twists that occurred were realistic and could actually happen! You actually were forced to sympathize with the characters because the relationships between them were real (for the most part), their environment was real, and their emotions were believable. Why couldn't Kanon have gone down that road? Instead, it simply relies on a bunch of supernatural crap that makes no sense and is more frustrating then it is sad. People can't sympathize with something that is not explained and not relatable to their lives in someway (unless they are just looking for a mindless excuse to cry).\\n\\n\r\nKanon does have its redeeming qualities I suppose, particularly the artwork. The animation in Kanon is stunning at times, but I'm not crazy bout the character design. I know that anime characters are supposed to have big eyes, but Kanon's female characters have heads that are about 50% eye. That is a bit absurd. The music was good, but not great. The OP is horrible, for example. Above average animation and music is simply not enough to save an anime from disturbingly horrible characters (Yuuichi is alright I guess) and poor writing decisions.\u00a0I don't see the appeal of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 2/10\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 2/10\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10",

            "content": "\"Can you promise me?\"\r\nThese are dangerous words, and the answer that may follow them is even more dangerous. Sometimes people say it carelessly and wont be able to keep that promise, specially kids, since they still don't know the impact some words might have.\r\nThis is the main focus of Kanon. Things that happened on the past and haven't been forgotten. Promises that were done, and haven't been kept.\r\nIt's a unusual but still very interesting theme, that fits perfectly with the style of drama-romance Key/Visual Art's have. For those who aren't familiar with their visual novels and anime adaptations yet, Kanon would be a nice start.It's above the average VisualNovel adaptations you usually find. Of course, just like any other anime adapted from a VN, it does follow that concept of dividing the story into \"arcs\" one for each character, however, Kanon did this is such a unique way that the story flows naturally making the storyline clean and easy to follow. It isn't slow paced neither rushed, and may be a little depressing but nothing like a roller-coaster of emotions. A soft and beautiful tale, that may move some to tears and others not.\\n\\n\r\nThis time, MAL did a really nice job in the summary for this series, I don't have much to add. It's concise and leaves that curiosity on the air. In order to not be repetitive I'll just do a brief introduction of it.\\n\r\nYuiichi is an average high-school boy who just arrived at a countryside town where always snows. He used to go there a lot when he was little, and he would always stay in his cousin's house. However, due to some issues that he doesn't remember very well himself, he stopped going there. Now, after these long years he returned to this city, and while the days go by he will start to remember some things and some people from his past.\\n\r\nBeing Key's 'winter' project it is interesting to find the symbolism into some elements of the story. Why a city where it is always snowing? What emotions can we attach to winter, sadness maybe? Melancholy? Nostalgia? Those metaphors are all around the series, mixes in light \"supernatural\" and \"fantasy\" elements.\\n\\n\r\nJust like that, each of the characters also have an symbolism attached to them. Most of them represent stereotypes of common anime series. The shy girl, the tsundere, the funny and friendly guy... Even though, as many may thing, they are not plain characters. These stereotypes are attached to them but what the anime wants to show is that people can, and will, eventually change. Along the series, lots of episodes are focused solely on character development and this is one of the strongest points of Kanon. It differs from most of the romance series, where only the main characters actually have some development.\\n\\n\r\nSomething nice to point out, is that this series from KyoAni is already a remake from an anime of 2002. Then, you might ask, \"why should I watch this one rather then the first?\".\\n\r\nThe answer I'd give is pretty simple:\\n\r\nBoth are based on the same VisualNovel so, despite minor differences and some changes on the ending, the story is the same. KyoAni could learn from the mistakes Toei Animation did, and improved the script, just like with a higher budget and a new technology they could go further on the animation, sound and artwork.\\n\r\nThis wasn't the first time they did an anime adaptation of a Key's VN, and the previously projects turned out really well, so, If I were you, I'd bet my chips on this one.\\n\\n\r\nLike that, the artwork and the soundtrack were a joy of sidekicks.\\n\r\nAll the light/filters effects KyoAni have in their arsenal made of artwork one of the strongest supporters for the story. This, allied with a diverse selection of piano pieces -sometimes in a cheerful mood and sometimes in a dark and sadder tone- with also a strong opening increases the emotional factor the story carries.\\n\r\nBeing I one of those people who gives a lot of value for this two topics, it is great when I can say honestly in a review that the anime managed to blend all of them very well.\\n\r\nNo complains here.\\n\\n\r\nEven though, Kanon does have some broken strings and loose ends.\\n\r\nOne of the biggest problems studios face while adapting a VN to anime is how will they write the ending. In the Visual Novel you have lots of alternative endings, each for a character or situation. During the anime producers could choose into animating all routes but when it comes to an end it needs to be decided which one will be \"the one\". They could select one or merge them all but always considering the pace of the story.\\n\r\nHere is where Kanon messes up a bit with the great story that was developed so far. Close to the end it becomes really slow paced, in a way someone with a small attention spam would soon find it boring. Just for in the last couple of episodes, finish in a incredibly fast mood. It suddenly switch from a calm pace to a very rushed final episode, making all that storyline that was elaborated throughout the whole series be obfuscated by an predicable ending. Leaving for you just that bad taste of \"what? Oh. It's over.\"\\n\\n\r\nBesides, Kanon do strikes again even in that messed ending.\\n\r\nIt doesn't try to impose emotions or feels on you like some other dramas when it comes to emotional scenes. The scenes flows naturally with a clear OST that isn't forceful which is great because this way you don't loose the focus.\\n\\n\r\nSometimes, people like refer to Kanon as \"Clannad's OVA\" or \"Clannad little sister\".\\n\r\nWhile it is funny to say that, you must be very careful if you will make an assumption like that. It is not something nice to say for someone who is new to anime, because that person won't get what you're trying to say and will loose his/her interest in this series.\\n\r\nBoth animes do share some characteristics. The setting of the story is similar and also some characters. As you would expect from two stories that share the same author. However, I would say Clannad is a romance with drama, while Kanon is a drama with romance. Both for those with strong hearts!\\n\r\nOverall, it is a story everyone should watch. And watch open minded, appreciating the ideals the story is trying to share.\\n\\n\r\nJust a end-of-review curiosity, The series name comes from the title of an composition by a german baroque composer called Pachelbel. Pachelbel's Kanon. (\"Canon/Kanon\" stands for a style, where a main melody is followed by several \"imitations\" of it, like if it is being repeated, just with crescendos and tempo variations).\\n\r\nReminds the series opening?\\n\r\nCoincidentally or not, another famous baroque arrangement is named \"-Air- on the G string\" another Key's title.\\n\\n\r\nAs always, thank you for your time! ...And yes. We all agree this kind of eroge-adapted harem is kinda clich\u00e9. But what can you do? They are also addicting as fuck!",

            "content": "There is most likely typos, but please try to overlook them.\r\nWhat lies before us here is an unique anime which is sure to leave deep marks in your heart, and make you create emotions you didn't know you even possessed.\r\nThe Anime Kanon 2006 is an adaption of a visual novel with the same name created by the company key.\r\nAlthough I haven't played the game, I can mention that it was created in 1999. This means that you shouldn't by any means compare this anime to the other adaptions of key's works (Clannad, Air & Little Busters) as Kanon was created earlier than the beforementioned. (Especiallyon things such as character design, personality and plot in general)\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nI gave the story a straight 10/10 grade. The different arcs within this series is perfectly entwined together and goes by extremely smoothly. The plotline of the show circles around the protagonist \"Yuuichi\", who travels back to his cousin's town, which he used to visit in his childhood years. The story is brought forward by the past being more and more unraveled, while Yuuichi creates deeper relationships with the heroines of the story. The supernatural aspects of the story enhances the mysterious mood which the anime tries to create.\\n\\n\r\nBy the end of the anime you will gasp and think how everything fit together. The rewatch value of this show is very high, as you might need some time to assemble all the pieces together.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nAs for character art, that's something entirely subjective. Even though you might prefer smaller eyes or more mature looking characters, I can objectively conclude that the characters are drawn very detailed. The hair and clothes have a lot of small details which enrichens the visual experience. The animation is very fluid, and the backgrounds fits the mood perfectly. If you watch the show in 1080p your eyes might have an experience of euphoria.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe music in Kanon is made by the Jun Maeda. He is known for composing key's music and his works are in the highest tier.\\n\r\nA majority of the music consists of many calming and sad tunes which is mainly performed on piano, while some is using music box. Different ambient and semi-jazzy tracks is also featured. For music lovers such as myself this grade weights pretty hard, and the music is absolutely remarkable.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED is very captivating, where the OP is more on the sad side while the ED creates a more positive mood. While the show is overall pretty tearshredding, the ED helps you to maintain a feeling of hope.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nOn my part this weights the most when I'm rating anime. The protagonist is Kanon is a lighthearted person which is incredibly easy to like.\\n\r\nAs for the heroines of the story, they are all extremely unique. Most of the heroines in the anime is rather mysterious, and very likeable overall. The character developement is brought forward very nicely, and the relationship between the characters is given a lot of thought on beforehand. The wide range of personalities and distinctiv behaviors of the characters in the series creates a lot of variety, and I can ensure you that you're gonna love at least 2 or 3 of the characters in the story.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nWhen I first watched the show in 2012 I hadn't shed a tear for many years. After completing the series I broke down in a hour of constantly crying. That was the feeling of fulfillment I had. The show sure made a great impact on me, and my life ended up being changed.\\n\\n\r\nAs for who that will enjoy this show, I dare to say that it fits for everyone.(above 14~ years, as the show is rather complex) The show features thrilling moments, a lot of sad moments and moments where you will sit in you chair and smile like an idiot for minutes.\\n\r\nThe romance in the series is remarkable compared to other series in the \"harem\" genre and also generally. Although the show is not tagged as a slice of life, I would say that it also fulfills your needs of getting a close view on the characters daily life. The series will satisfy mystery lovers to the degreed that you might not sit on the chair and wonder who the murder is, but rather figuring out how everything is put together.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\r\nBy giving 10 in all the other categories, one can easily figure out that the final rating will be 10/10. The anime is of extremely high quality and everyone should have it in their shelf collection. For me the hours I used to watch the show was the most appreciated hours before the screen of all time. (at least if we take in mind TV shows and everything being displayed on the TV)\\n\\n\r\nI hope this review was helpful, I'm not experienced with writing reviews and this was my first go.\\n\r\nI appreciate feedback on stuff that could've been done better. I might have been unclear on some parts and I apologise for that.\\n\\n\r\nAt last I wish you a nice day and a good watch~",

            "content": "\"It's called a miracle because it never happens.\" - Misaka Shiori\r\nThis review could contain some spoilers if you have not watched Clannad.\r\nKanon (2006) or Kanon for short, as a whole is a riveting story, but it left me wanting a bit more, no, I don't mean it in a good way. I'll explain it soon.\r\nStory: You have Yuuichi Aizawa, who returns to a city he used to visit after being gone for several years. He lives with his cousin Nayuki, and goes to school with her. As soon as he transfers to her school, that's when things begin to ravel, and he recollects his past.I won't explain much because I'm afraid I might spoil, but the synopsis is there for you. The story is a very entertaining one if you're a fan of drama and romance. The episodes are set up nicely, leaving you wanting to watch the next one. Don't let the cliches early in the series drive you away, as the rest of the series can change your mind about it. Keep in mind that this series has 'Supernatural' as one of the genres, so try not to judge this with realism. This may be slow paced for some people, but comparing this to Clannad (which you should not fully compare it to), the story runs at a much quicker pace.\\n\r\nRating: 9\\n\\n\r\nComparing to Clannad: I think Clannad is more popular than Kanon, so more people probably have watched that first. Keep in mind that Clannad was aired a couple of months after Kanon was done, so the similarities between the two are very high. The plot between the two are not 100% identical, but this being a Key visual novel adaptation, well I'm not saying anymore. What I'm saying is you shouldn't compare those two thinking it's the absolute same thing. The difference I can say about Kanon is that the drama and conflict isn't as forced as After Story.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The development between Yuuichi and the other characters was pretty good, but I think could have been improved on some characters. However, it's just enough to make you know a lot about them, know their relationships between the main character, and understand their feelings. The conflict and drama of Kanon really hit you hard, and that's what kept me interested in this series.\\n\r\nRating: 9\\n\\n\r\nSound: To start Kanon, Last Regrets is played as the opening, which I think is really fitting to the series and is a great song in general. However, the soundtrack is the real thing. Some of the tracks are from the visual novel, but everything is fitting throughout. Oh yeah, Canon in D.\\n\r\nRating: 10\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is comparable to Air, and looks almost identical to Clannad (e.g. Ayu looks a lot like Fuko), but nonetheless, the animations are just as good.\\n\r\nRating: 9\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: Kanon (2006) was a really enjoyable series to watch. The drama keeps you glued to your seat, and also makes you tear up in many moments. Though it left me wanting more, and supernatural elements playing a role, I was very satisfied with series, and would recommend it to anyone.\\n\r\nOverall Rating: 9",

            "content": "WOW...was my first reaction when I finished watching Kanon. IMO this is one of the BEST drama/romance animes you can watch. With amazing animation quality, incredible and touching storyline, the dynamic Key/Kyoto duo, and a bunch of super moe characters, Kanon 2006 quickly took a spot as one of my top animes and my reasons for it are:\r\nStory: Just like previous Key/KyoAni production Air, Kanon was mainly divided into different arcs for the different girls and each took a set number of episodes to unfold, each one bringing some sort of tragic or mysterious chain of events on our main character. I obviously have arcsthat I liked more than others but as a whole when you put Kanon's stories together you realize that you have just witnessed an amazing show with one of the most touching stories you can find out there. I dont wanna sound manly or anything but I have never cried while watching an anime, but Kanon 2006 has come the closest ever to making me cry for an animated character, while watching I would start to get teary eyed at the most sensitive moments and for that Kanon has a special place in me. I rounded down but my original score would be 9.4/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: With Kanon Kyoto Animation once again proved that they are kings of animation and production quality. All characters in Kanon were just amazingly well drawn and their animation were fluent and you could hardly ever see a scene where the animation would drop. Being in a city of snow, the colours of Kanon were not as bright and impressive as Air but that does not mean Kanon looked bad, all the colours used in Kanon were also bright and the show as a whole was really pretty to look at. The score of 10 stands and for a good reason.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I never really pay that much attention to sound when I watch animes but the musical backgrounds in Kanon mixed with the tragic events result in some of the most touching moments I've seen.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: When it comes to characters Kanon has plenty to choose from, with 5 main heroines and plenty of side characters Kanon is not lacking in this department. And did I mention every single one of them are just WAY TO CUTE! Kyoto has done a really great job at drawing them all and every one of them comes with a different personality resulting in the main character acting completely different towards each of them. Also since Kanon is a 24 episode series they had more time to introduce and develop each character more than in Air's 12 ep series (ep 13 does not count). The resulting mix gives you a show where you can really get emotionally attached to a character and when seeing their stories unfold you actually feel bad/good for them when an event occurs.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Despite having been depressed by this show's story many times, I can easily say that Kanon 2006 has been one of my favourite anime and I still rewatch some moments if I need some sadness in my life O_o\\n\\n\r\nOverall the second Key/Kyoto anime has been an incredible one and it shows that when you mix Key's amazing storytelling with Kyoto's amazing animation, the end result is an anime that will amaze you with the story and will drawn you in with their looks. Kanon 2006 is definitely a show that no one should miss even if you do not like the drama/romance shows, this is one of the few shows I've given a 10/10 it's that good.",

            "content": "A boy named Yuuichi is moving to a town he lived in seven years ago. However, he doesn't remember anything. When living in this town, he meets a lot of girls, all with tragic stories, and he helps them.\r\nSure, the concept sounds like just about any other anime based on a visual novel would be. However, despite several other shows of that type, this actually does remarkably well. \r\nSTORY\r\nWell, to be honest, this show has got to be one of the greater shows I've ever watched, no doubt! The story is just so good it leaves me astonished at times. It starts out as apretty normal show of its genre. You're also introduced to several of the girls, but it doesn't touch upon all their stories at once. There's some comedic moments every now and then.\\n\\n\r\nAt first it might seem like it's just some slice of life series, but the story progresses  a lot from its initial stages, and as you're taken through the individual girls' story arcs, you'll be taken away. It has good a lot of good moments, some romantic, some dramatic. However, just about everything that happens in the story later on will base itself on supernatural elements (mostly miracles), which makes a contrast to the earlier parts of it. That's not really a bad thing though; I at least found it most enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nART\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in the series is really awesome too; the character designs, details in environments and everything just looks awesome. The lighting which you find in many of the afternoon scenes is pure awesomeness too; it really makes the scenes moody; and very dramatic if that's what the scene is about.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Kanon is really awesome. The girls' stories are just awesome to behold, and Yuuichi's own background with them is very intriguing, and it ends up making you wanting to know more about it. The main hero, Yuuichi, is also a very interesting character in his own right. To be short about it; they are awesome and you'll love them (at least one or two of them).\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe music in this anime is really great as well. There's a lot of nice piano themes, so if you enjoy good piano themes you'll definitely enjoy the music in this series. The show's got some good music aside that too, and the OP and ED themes are magnificent.\\n\\n\r\nThere's nothing to say on the sounds aside the music, and the seiyuu do a great job on their roles; the characters' voices are very good.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this is a lovely anime, a true masterpiece. If you like anime series based on visual novels, you'll enjoy this. If you haven't watched any anime series of that kind, watch it anyway, because you'll love it.\\n\\n\r\nTo 'Not Helpful' voters (and you 'Helpful' voters too): Feedback greatly appreciated =)",

            "content": "This was a series that allowed my emotions to run wild. Each of the characters is presented with their own tragic tale of the past. Even the supernatural and fantasy elements are carefully intertwined in the story in such a way that it does not stick out. This is truly an excellent series.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nThe development starts out rather slow and silly and can get a bit dull. I was on a hiatus with this series for almost half a year before I started watching again. It is set up like a harem series, but it is different from them, which sets it apart from otherharem series. It is not a harem in a story; it is a story with a harem. There is a difference, and Kanon does it extremely well. Look at all the anime out there. Many of them have similar plots, but what makes some better than others? The execution of the story, and this is where Kanon shines. There is a constant air of mystery behind everything: the characters, the setting, the season, and so forth. The story is emotional, dramatic, and even light-hearted at times. With this nice blend, a seemingly simple story of a new boy surrounded by a group of girls becomes a unique tale. The only major problem was that when one of the girl's arc ended, they completely disappeared in another character's arc. This style feels way too much like a visual novel, and lacks blending and character interaction.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThere is not much to say about the art and animation when it is done by Kyoto Animations because most of it is a regurgitation of what other fans have already said: absolutely amazing, gorgeous, and stunning. The setting and season of winter are extremely well drawn so that it puts the viewers into that setting. Falling snow has never look so good in an anime until now. It does not just fall; it falls in a way that I could watch it forever. The art style, though it's very clear, colorful and crisp, is a bit generic. The designs are of the eyes, a staple in these types of stories, were a bit too large and I did not like.\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\\n\r\nAh, canon, canon, Kanon. There are reasons why this series is called that, and one of the more obvious reasons is the presence of Pachelbel's Canon in D Major. Such a lovely piece, especially for one who has already played it. Besides that, the music complements the mood very nicely. When things get dramatic and sad, it is the music that allows those tears to run free. Although I did not find any one track that stood out for me (except for well, the obvious one) the music was nice and fitting. It would not be a soundtrack that I would listen to without the anime playing though. The voice acting was also very good, although every time Yuuichi opened his mouth, I immediately thought of Kyon. It does not help that those two look uncannily similar.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this series were a bit generic but that's not necessarily a bad thing with the right development and execution. They did all have their mysteries, problems and development. Every character, from the first time they appear on screen, seems to have a mysterious side. Each of them are different and stands out. And Yuuichi is such an awesome lead. He can be a bit insensitive and playful at times, but he truly is a nice guy and it's not surprising that he's so well liked among the girls. The major downside in this series is the lack of interaction among the girls. Once a girls' story arc is done, they aren't really seen all that much until the end. It would have fleshed out their characters more if they interacted more.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime all right; enjoyed it to the point I cried through episodes nonstop. It might have also been the fact that I marathoned three or four episode at once, so the water works just seemed to never stop. There were times where I laughed out loud, times where I cheered (the ending), and many times where I bawled my eyes out.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed this series immensely. It has a touch of everything: drama, comedy, supernatural elements and so forth. I thought it was a very enjoyable series despite its flaws. 8/10",

            "content": "Kanon is the the last of the Kyoto Animation animated Key visual novels that I had to see. Somehow I'd managed to watch all of Clannad, Clannad After Story and Air. While writing staff and directing staff differ slightly with each iteration, there's an incredibly clear singular style between each anime. It's a style that with each series of theirs I watch, and those inspired by its nakige formula such as Ano Hana, I can increasingly see the strings for. Strings that are made from the bloodied remains of mentally deficient little girls killed mercilessly and dangled limply from the fingers of Key writer JunMaeda as he coos \"who's now the perfect image of a woman, yes you are, yes you are\".\\n\\n\r\nHere is the general outline for a Key story arc. First you introduce a little girl. She is supposedly a teenager the same age as our asshole lead male character. However at every single turn we are establishing how childlike they are. They look 6 years old, they act like they\u2019re 6 years old, the male lead constantly treats them like they\u2019re 6 years old and outright tells them they might as well be 6 years old. Each girl has their own little quip that in one girl\u2019s case might as well be her saying \u201cgoo goo\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nThey are also depicted as fragile and weak and needing your attention. A bunch of them are in the slow process of dying, either through poorly explained illnesses or magical illnesses. They\u2019re emotionally fragile and with each arc fall apart in their own ways. One girl in particular has her own rotary functions and general maturity, what little of it there was, stripped away from her. The reasons for this shift usually comes straight out of the writer\u2019s backsides, such as a character\u2019s mum getting randomly hit by a car because we needed little girls to be more emotionally unstable.\\n\\n\r\nTheir emotional instability and life view all appears to come from when the girls were 6 years old (as in actually on this planet for 6 years, not just emotionally 6 years old). The childhood promise is the most powerful force in the world of Kanon, capable of raising the dead and conjuring ghosts. According to the world of Kanon, all relationships are born from before the age of 6 and everyone you meet since then might as well not exist. Nearly all the girls in Kanon are desperately trying to get back to the relationship they had with the male character from when they were 6.\\n\\n\r\nYou get the uncomfortable feeling that the writers believe that the 6 year old mindframe for women is the ideal. Not just so you can comfort them as they slowly die, but from a romantic standpoint too, and whenever you try to strip them off this childlike state the show punishes them for it. Kanon operates on horror movie logic where as soon as a girl displays anything resembling romantic feelings it gets stripped from them. Even if their romantic feelings come from a desire to just be together with someone because they\u2019re lonely, as soon as anything resembling romance happens is when the show starts killing them.\\n\\n\r\nThat is this nakige formula. Key aren't the only people who do it, but they\u2019re certainly the most famous. Bring in a female character. Make the male lead belittle her in s\u2019life segments for her immaturity so he can establish his place as above her. Reveal that she may have romantic feelings for her. Then strip the girl of any independence either physically or emotionally and then usually kill her.\\n\\n\r\nNormally a reviewer will say that the worst thing a piece of entertainment\u2019s can do is be boring, but that\u2019s not Kanon\u2019s problem. Certainly it is mind-blowingly boring since practically all the humour and conversations consist of a girl with no mental capacity being told by the main character how stupid she is. But the real reason I hate Kanon so much is the bits after that. The rinse and repeat of taking a little girl, stripping her of all agency and then killing her in order to draw tears from the audience, who invariably fall for it each and every time.\\n\\n\r\nNot that I blame you. The same way I don\u2019t blame people for clicking on buzzfeed clickbait articles on web advertising. They are designed in that insidious way to get you to click on them, and its only once you realise that do you stop supporting this \u201cYou Won\u2019t Believe These 8 Ways Miley Cyrus Hates Minecraft Pokemon\u201d headlines by not clicking on them. I know you think Kanon, Clannad and Air are emotional because they made you cry, but punching you in the face and breaking your nose would probably make you cry too. That doesn\u2019t make the punch a 10/10 emotional piece of high entertainment. All they are doing are taking weak creatures and killing them to draw a reaction from you. Stop falling for it.

            "content": "There is something very wrong with Key. It shows in most of their stories, but nowhere is it as obvious as in Kanon. It is a problem shared throughout the otaku industry, but once again, in Kanon it is more clear than anywhere else.\r\nThe problem seems to be a severe emotional immaturity and a nearly pathological fear of women. In Kanon, this influences nearly every female character: They are, through numerous contrivances, designed to be as non-threatening as possible. They are either so retarded that they would have no chance to function in society except by fiat of the writers, or not human, or otherwisedysfunctional and immature.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character, in turn, manages to fumble his way through the story without ever forming any kind of meaningful, human relationship with any of them, never feeling anything deeper for them than the affection one might feel for a pet, or the grief one would feel at the loss of a pet. This is even true in a literal sense for one of the poor girls, who turns out to actually be a pet.\\n\\n\r\nNone of it feels real in any way. It is a shallow fantasy, written by emotionally stunted people. It depicts a desire for human contact devoid of any risk of being hurt, or deeply affected in any way. It is really quire disturbing to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is, in a purely technical sense, very beautiful - Kyoto Animation are masters at their craft, and the art is wonderful and the direction tight. But the core of the story is rotten, and no amount of dress-up can change that.",

            "content": "Animation - 6\r\nIt' the same character design as we've all seen in Air and Clannad.  Big, glassy eyes, with proportionately large tears.  It's nothing new, but it is polished.  Animation wise, it's what we know of from Key.  Hair whipping through snow, blades of grass, and orbs of light.  No striking animation sequences, or dynamic animation at all except for a fight that Mei gets into, but nothing special.\r\nSound - 6\r\nKannon is rife with pseudo-ambient music and music box themes that would make Enya decry the milquetoastness of it all.  The opening and ending are forgettably familiar.  Therewas one good jazzy piano piece that seemed to show up when an obstacle was revealed that was quite good.  If only the rest of the music had that charm and added that much texture.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 4\\n\r\nAs has been said these characters are stock.  We've seen them all, the sick girl, the loli, the comedy duo, the rich girl, the blond-only-other-guy-in-the-whole-show, the relative with a crush, and on and on.  It's all so bland.  Mei (quiet girl), gets it right, Yuuichi (the main character) is a weak person that pretends to be strong, hurting everyone around him without a modicum of self awareness.  His selfishness disguised as selflessness knows no bounds and no one ever dares to call him out on it.  In fact, everyone loves him for it.  This phenomena results in the show having no character development for the main character at all.  In fact, I only think that one character &quot;develops&quot; and it was just her behavior suddenly changing.  Shiori's (sick girl) lack of knowing  the name of what's ailing her is the main example of  the lack of thought and depth that writers put in characters.  Of course, they only want viewers to shed tears, so the most superficial of characters is all that's needed if they can make you cry, right?\\n\\n\r\nStory - 4\\n\r\nWrong.  If Kanon were a horror story, more would make sense, because, just like every other Key series, Kanon systematically tries to murder every focus character in the male protagonists' Messiah Complex wake.  Except that  they don't even have the ball to stick to a single death in the show;  moments later the writing backtracks (once it scored the tears from viewers hearts) and magically brings characters back to life.\\n\\n\r\nIf I took this show seriously, I would think that this was some horrible misogynistic fantasy about a boy who is the only person capable of saving all these girls lives within the span of what?  Two months?  Once Yuuichi has saved the girl of the arc, we don't hear of them ever again until the end when, of course, we have to have the pussy parade to show how much the protagonist has accomplished.  Kanon is the worst offender in the Key series of trying to have some pseudo-metaphysical lore intertwine with the plot in that it directly affects these characters in the most mindboggling plot twists.  Faith healers, fox spirits, girls with magical wishes?  Furthermore, the overall plot development is set aside for the gir of the arc stories so that, by the last four or five episode they try, in futility to make the story work.   \\n\r\nTo confess, accept and lose someone you love all in the same episode, without any buildup whatsoever, what is that supposed to do?  Am I supposed to feel bad?  The writing doesn't let characters organically grow with one another in exchange for the &quot;mystery&quot; factor so that, once the leads are together, you ask yourself,   What makes her more special than the others?...you forgot about all of these girls, and didn't remember them until it was too late.  It's the same with her.  Why is she special?  Ridiculous.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 3\\n\r\nSo Kanon left a bad taste in my mouth.  I actively avoided this show, because I already knew what was going to happen once I read the synopsis, and guess what?  I was right.  I couldn't even get behind the one character that I should have liked, Jun, because he was so randomly placed, and had little impact on the story.  If anything, I had to drop my score of Clannad, because whatever originality I saw in it vaporized the moment I completed this show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 4\\n\r\nIn the show, the writers try to draw a comparison between Kanon and Pachabel's Canon in D.  If only Kanon could be so groundbreaking; instead it comes off as merely derivative and uninspired.  It is clear that Kanon was a testing ground of ideas, characters and setting for the more thematically tight (if also anemic) Air and Clannad.  Kannon forgoes plot, character, and logical development for trite gimmicks intended for the emotionally immature to shed tears of empathy, leaving the show  is thematically vacant and lacking ambition.",

This Anime is that great!\r\n&bull; Story -  I rated the story a 9 because I thought that the fantasy thing was the only part holding it back. Although it still was a good part to have demons and miracles, buti did love how everything was put together from his memories that he forgot seven years back. It is on borderline with 10 though.\\n\\n\r\n&bull; Art -  The Art was a 10 for me, It is has incredible graphics that will not let you down. Its perfect, the surroundings look amazing and the city is like it was real! I have nothing negative to say about the graphics and Art.\\n\\n\r\n&bull; Sound -  The sound for this Anime has earned a 10. I absolutely loved the sounds and music this Anime had to offer. Again, nothing bad to say about in the category. You will not be disappointed.\\n\\n\r\n&bull; Character -  The Characters in this anime are seriously a 10. The characters in this Anime are all unique in their own ways and not to mention cute. very nice and yet again nothing horrible to say here.\\n\\n\r\n&bull; Enjoyment -  this Anime deserves a 10 because I completly enjoyed this anime, even though it had sad, happy, angry, scary moments. This has to have been one of my most enjoyed Anime's I have ever watched before.\\n\\n\r\n&bull; Overall -  The overall score i gave this anime is seriously a 10. It deserved this score because of how much i loved it and I thought everything about it was just incredible!",

            "content": "This is by far one of the most moving, heart-wrenching, and dramatic anime series I have ever watched.  It's earned a special place in my heart and I will undoubtedly buy the DVDs as well.  Everything from the story, the characters, settings and re-occuring themes within Kanon reverberate with passion and drama; a kind of quality that is hardly ever seen in most anime, yet not only have they accomplished such a feat but have raised the bar for everyone else wanting to make a lasting and memorable masterpiece.\r\nThemes of lost love, death, sickness, and the supernatural constantly propel the story forward forall of the characters, and heightened moments of tension between the male lead and the female characters create an unmatched and unrivaled level of drama with deep backstories and development.  \\n\\n\r\nAs the story pulls you into the world of Kanon, the anime presents itself in an almost mundane, slice-of-life approach that helps you to get associated with the characters.  After the setting and theme has been established, you begin to feel for these characters and to sympathize with them as the story begins to delve more into their past and what kind of stories relate to them.  Then the story makes a huge and unpredictable plot twist that turns Kanon into a nonstop rollercoaster ride that will have you glued to your seat until the very last episode.\\n\\n\r\nEach of the characters have amazingly unique and original storyline arcs , and at least one (if not all of them) is going to be a guaranteed tear jerker.  What's more impressive is how each story arc ties itself together into a main story making it feel extremely cohesive and smooth rather than disconjoined and random.\\n\\n\r\nAs per KEY's style of storytelling, the anime is heavily prevalent with storybook-style lore and magic.  This type of theme can be noticed in other types of anime in the same genre, however the means by which they use this setting along with the amazing characters and unique story help elevate the experience further rather than dampen it.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are into any form of romantic dramas, or are looking for something refreshingly unique, or something that will make you cry, or if you just want to simply enjoy a breathtakingly moving story that will leave a lasting impression on you, Kanon is a must watch if not a must BUY.\\n",

            "content": "Story:\r\nThis is by far the best storyline i have seen out of all the anime i have seen. The unique side stories between the female protagonists were deeply touching and even made my cry on every single one. Unlike a lot of anime it really showed the slice of life side of things, it hinted a minority of fantasy which was revealed fairly early on into the story. I'm going to give this a 10. \r\nArt:\r\nI must say that a good storyline and excellent artwork is rare to find in any anime, but in Kanon they got those two just right, not too realistic, nottoo cartoony, but a perfect balance in my eyes. The movement of the characters themselves were a very good pointer but the main attraction to the artwork would have to be the environmental side of things, the scenery of the forest, the city and everything else were just fantastic. 10 for this aswell.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nBoth the opening and ending themes to this anime were good, as the story progressed and more and more information about the characters were revealed the songs seemed to be more touching, as the video to it showed clips of the characters in actions, somehow reminding me of their stories. The voice actors chosen for this were just right. Aya especially, her voice was so cute and fit the character most impressively from the rest. Another 10 for this also.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nFrom my previous points you can probably already tell what i'm going to say.. the characters were brilliantly done, and the anime would be 100% ruined without any of them in. Each and every character were different in their own way, and fitted the character setting and stories behind them. I'd have to say Mai was a personal favourite, as she was brilliantly done. Another 10 for this aswell.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment factor of this anime was amazing, some bits of it were funny, whilst others were deeply heart-touching. I liked this element of the anime, as it's totally different from anything i've ever seen (I don't think i've cried like that for a very long time). So i'd have to give this a 10, as it's my favourite anime yet, and until another 'Miracle' happens, it will always stay to be as far as i'm concerned.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall i'd have to give this anime a 10/10. Theres not much more i can say apart from if you haven't watched this, i definately suggest it. It's more realistic than any other anime, with a hint of fantasy which works very well mixed in it. \\n\\n\r\nI hope this review was helpful, thanks.\\n\\n\r\nAyu-Ayu",

            "content": "For an amazing anime it had way too many flaws. I loved the characters, the story behind them and the emotions conveyed throughout the entirety of the anime. But to be honest with you there was a lot of wrong with this anime, such as how a lot of the things introduced in this anime made no sense and it was clear that the writers didn't want it to.\r\nMakoto's story arc has to be the one I love the most. She was a great character to begin with and just like Kaori she actually felt like a normal girl, but that slowly changed for betterand for worse. We also had involvement of a character named Amano where her role was to help guide Yuuichi on how to deal with the problem that was facing Makoto and Yuuichi, as she had experienced this 'miracle' before.\\n\\n\r\nAfter Yuuichi had learnt the truth, Makoto became more and more child-like, in the sense of an innocent child. She lost the ability to use her hands properly and slowly lost her ability to speak; she could only say \"Auu~\" after that. Because of this Yuuichi had to spend more time with her making her happy and showing her that he'll never leave again. During those moments, the events that followed and the music that was playing worked so well together making us adore her even more. As the viewer, we already know she is going to die so having these scenes only make the departure more depressing. Not only that but twice has the Makoto survived a fever and a sleep which brings us a sense of hope, false hope.\\n\\n\r\nEven though I cried because of this arc, the other arcs didn't do much to me. It was all because this arc had me invested and actually made sense. Ignoring the fact that she is one of the children who are Youko, this felt very realistic.\\n\\n\r\nI will not go over any of the major flaws, mostly because this will end up being a rant but partly because I forgot most of them as I've seen it done too much in other anime.\\n\\n\r\nFor a modernised '90s artwork, it looks amazing. I watched a few minutes of the '02 version of the anime and found that it was quite hard to watch, and the girls looked a lot more human in this version. Might I add Yuuichi had a complete redraw while the girls were simply updated. The backgrounds were beautiful but wasn't anything special. As I mentioned above, the background music is always working well with what is appearing on-screen and it was able to easily bring more emotion out of me as well as sounding pretty good. Also the OP and ED suited this anime very well, it showed that it was a generic love story with no real goal.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I loved the show and most of the characters as well as being interested in them, but the complexity of this anime can only go so far, however being the analytical person I am (even if I don't type them down) the flaws ruin it for me.",

There's only one overall plot whichcan only be described in three words, &quot;Dreams, Miracles &amp; Memories&quot; and it's really how this all has affected the different girls that the male protagonist, Yuichi Aizawa, has encountered. It's really interesting because you never know what to expect since all the girls emit a sweet aroma of mystery.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of this anime are a major aspect to the story and because it is based on a visual novel, then there are a lot of cute girls. Although just like similar anime series like &quot;Air&quot; you can expect the girls to have the typical personalities however they are each well developed in their own way. It is really just the male protagonist that stands out from the rest and it's thanks to the performance his voice actor that Yuichi is brought to life, through his emotions and witty comments.\\n\\n\r\nJust like any &quot;Kyoto Animation&quot; production, the animation is beautifully perfect and cannot be topped. If you've seen &quot;Air&quot;, &quot;The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya&quot; or &quot;Full Metal Panic &ndash; TSR&quot; then you'll know what to expect; cute well-drawn girls, dynamic environments and fluid movements. The music is also something that helps the show, with some nice sweet melodies that go well with every situation.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this has to be one of the best romance anime series, based on a visual novel, because even with a weak plot the stories were still amazing. This anime is mostly full of cute and hilarious moments but in between all that there's plenty of tear-jerking drama, romance and even action to be satisfied with.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend this series to anyone who loves Kyoto Animation productions, or isn't afraid to show their emotions because you'll need a box of tissues for this series.\\n\r\n^_^",

            "content": "Kanon(2006) will give you a warm feeling, but the lack of character's depth and the slow story can make you turn away from it.\r\nNote: I'll stop saying Kanon(2006) and say Kanon instead, you get the point.\r\nThe story in Kanon is based around a guy related with girls. Somehow this guy suffers from amnesia, which I never knew why. He can't remember any of the past relations he had with them seven years ago. What stroked me the most is that for a 24 episodes show, it was slow. If you're not a fan of stories that graduate so slowly that you don't know where it'sgetting, and then Kanon is probably something you won't watch. However, Kanon like any other series from Key has this little touch of magic that gives you a warm feeling, so it's not a useless story after all. As for Key animations, they are probably good at shiting you with the reality of life, Kanon is no exception there. Sadly, the way Kanon is told, you would never get the build up of a strong relationship between characters, except between Mai and Yuuichi. Mai is probably the only female lead who doesn't \"disappear\". In summary, the story is light, nothing outstanding but nothing too bad.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is probably mostly annoying in the art are the girls. They all look innocent, have the same small mouth, the same face and the huge eyes. I'll tell you now, I'm not a fan of the huge eyes, and in this term, Kanon delivers. You love them? Go watch Kanon now. Still, I loved the backgrounds, the city of snow, the lighting. If you forget the characters, I\u2019d probably give art a 9.5/10.\\n\\n\r\nWhat do you get with innocent looking girls? Yes, you mostly get an annoying voice cast. I probably got tired of \" UGUUUUUUUU\" after the 10th time(which I believe was the first episode). As for the music, it goes well with the mood. Listening to Kanon music would probably make you depressive. IT IS a depressive show after all.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said in my introduction, Kanon strongly lack in character's depth. What I mean by \"lack\", I totally mean that the characters are flat. Not only the girls all look innocent, they actually act innocent for most of them. Their characteristic makes the show hard to watch, as there is not enough. However, they all have this mysterious and secret past that will hold you on watching the show only for the reason of knowing it. I'll give a thumbs to Key for this, now that's what I call marketing. Anyway, the show didn't have a strong variation of characters, that's why someone would probably think they're all the same.\\n\\n\r\nAfter all these mix of good and bad things, I can say that I actually enjoyed Kanon more than I hated it. Yes, the long moments of silence, the slow story and the flat characters is what I hated it, but you'd still get this mix of sad and happy feeling after watching it. Like most of key's animations, Kanon is a form of relaxation. You won't get any suspense, strong drama, big tragedies, but you'll feel relaxed.\\n",

            "content": "A bit disappointing, but not bad. (BTW, There are a few spoilers)\r\nEveryone seemed to have a really good opinion of Kanon 2006, so I expected the most out of it. I was left a bit dissatisfied, but was entertained nonetheless.\r\nI had a totally different idea about it before I started watching it. I thought it was going to be an anime about normal, run-of-the-mill anime people, but this is KyoAni after all. There were times when my jaw would just drop and my shoulders would shrug, connoting I didn&rsquo;t understand some details, but I did pick up its essence in the end. It was almostlike a roller coaster ride for me, except when it went down it didn&rsquo;t go so low. It had a lot of good points too; believe me when I say I got teary eyed during the last 2 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nIt also bothered me how quickly the characters would adapt to their current situation. They would cross paths with a fox which turned into a human, the spirit of a girl in comatose, a girl battling her own demons and many other weird characters, and yet they would immerse themselves in their daily lives as if nothing happened. It is anime world, after all.\\n\\n\r\nDespite their individual eccentricities, the characters were actually likable. I sympathize with the girls, and I even feared that another one would disappear after Makoto. Makoto was my favorite, I especially found her to be cute when she started to lose her human self, then Shiori, then Mai. Kyon, no, Yuiichi was also a very interesting character. He&rsquo;s mostly responsible for every chuckle and cackle I would make each episode, it&rsquo;s almost like TMoHS all over again.\\n\\n\r\nNow that I mentioned Kyon, how great is it to have Tomokazu Sugita on board? He&rsquo;s my favorite male seiyuu so far, being part of 2 other series I like, namely Honey and Clover and TMoHS of course. There&rsquo;s also the cameo of Maaya Sakamoto, my favorite female seiyuu, which made this anime sweeter for me &ndash; although she did portray a character I hated at first. Yui Horie is another name that got me. Shall we say ~uguu? Let&rsquo;s add an ~auu, ~nyuu and ~ahaha to that as well.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation is just top notch, and this is one of the most notable differences between the original Kanon and Kanon 2006. Kanon 2006 looked much more detailed (but not in a way that will strain your eyes), the characters were revamped and the backgrounds were very stunning. Plus there&rsquo;s the CG too. The CG was just breathtaking &ndash; it complimented the scenes very well, and it was of high quality.\\n\\n\r\nI wish I can say I like the music, but I found it a bit too dreary for me. Sometimes I felt like falling asleep to the opening song. I&rsquo;m not saying I hate it, I did find myself singing along whenever the OP/ED would start playing, but I wish the music was something that I liked more. The feel was very dramatic, the kind you would see in really sad shojo anime, but in a way, it does fit the theme of the anime. Also, I find that the music is well made, but again, it&rsquo;s not for me. Props for using Disney&rsquo;s Sleeping Beauty theme in episode 12. It&rsquo;s one of my favorite Disney songs.\\n\\n\r\nDon&rsquo;t you just love when there&rsquo;s little to none fanservice? I think the only hint of fan service I found was in the first episode, when Nayuki was changing her clothes. I&rsquo;m sure there were more, but they were probably not too vulgar that I didn&rsquo;t notice. It&rsquo;s quite surprising, actually. My initial thought was that Kanon 2006 would be one of those typical harem anime series, but again, it&rsquo;s KyoAni after all.\\n\\n\r\nFor making a viable remake, I&rsquo;d give Kanon 2006 a perfect 10. For entertaining me? I&rsquo;d say 7-8ish.",

            "content": "[Adapted From Original Blog Post]\r\nI\u2019ve never been extremely fond of the whole slice of life/drama series in anime. From where I stand they seem like boring, by-the-book series that never go anywhere, do anything, and have a main character that is as interesting as a window curtain. This in mind, when I go into such series, there\u2019s a certain bit of apprehension, or dread if you will, cause I know that it will be about 50% walking around at school and 45% drama that has no substance.\r\nThis doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019ve never enjoyed a slice-of-life(Clannad, SNAFU, School Days(joking)) but when I first looked at Kanon, Ijust felt the urge to laugh. A series based of a Key Visual Novel adapted by Kyoto Animation, that has 5 equally adorable girls on the cover? Right, think I got this. There\u2019s going to be some boring bloke who has some reason to be new to the setting, there\u2019s going to be one girl who has the personality and emotional capacity of a certain Evangelion character, there\u2019s going to be another girl who looks and acts about 5, and the entire cast has some kind of dark past or trauma that will rear its ugly head by the end of the series. Granted, I did get that, but it\u2019s not as straight forward as it seems. \\n\\n\r\nLets begin with our protagonist: Yuichi Aizawa, the teenager who has just moved back to a city where he spent like two weeks staying with his aunt and cousin, in order to go to school there. He actually pretty normal, but the one thing he has going for him is massive snark. He reminds me vividly of The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya\u2019s Kyon, only without the ability to occasionally keep his mouth shut. He always seems to have something to say about everyone and everything, and this wit is what drives the shows comedy. It\u2019s actually pretty funny too, and that\u2019s good, cause bland comedy and repetition get along like a toe and hangnail. Despite this, Yuichi proves multiple times that he actually cares a lot for other people, and will do anything for anybody who thinks needs his help. I really like his character, and he makes a great protagonist for the show.\\n\\n\r\nNext up is our \u201cmain girl\u201d Ayu Tsukimiya, the aforementioned 5yr old looking girl. She tends to be in the center of whatever is happening, acting like a sidekick for Yuichi and helping him with his problems. Since the show follows an ark format, this allows her to be always in the background while we concentrate on a certain girl, but always in the show. This builds a lot to her, and is crucial for the show\u2019s final ark, which just so happens to be about her. She\u2019s an eccentric and overly optimistic girl, but of course she has a dark past that shapes why she acts the way she does. Actually she\u2019s not quite as well rounded as some of the other characters on the show, but she\u2019s clearly the one the show wants to focus on. It\u2019s like being told to watch grass grow while a giant panda is floating in the sky behind you, firing gamma rays from its mouth. Yes I cared what happened to her by the end, but I can\u2019t help but feel that might be due more of the time I spent watching her than actually character likability and complexity. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the supporting cast is ridiculously strong, each with their own backstory and screen time. While I can\u2019t talk about them all, keep watch for the Misaki sisters, who probably had the best developed ark in the show, Makato Sawatari, an unassumingly complex girl whose arc came the closest to making me shed a tear, and Minase Nayuki, Yuichi\u2019s cousin, who is really hard to wake up in the morning. I\u2019m glad the show was able to build such strong characters, since the plot certainly isn\u2019t going to get of its ass and help forward the narrative is it? Character driven is something you could use to describe Kanon, and in my book, that\u2019s a good thing. \\n\\n\r\nNow the biggest problem I have with these kind of shows usually is the way they handle drama. What I hate, and what these shows usually do, is put drama in there for the sake of it. For example, I\u2019ll cry because a puppy died, yes, but it actually takes a good show for me to cry because I liked that puppy. I knew its motivations and personality; its fears and dreams, and I can see how it all built up to the event. See what I mean? It\u2019s easy to have a tragic backstory, but it\u2019s harder to make the viewer truly care. Luckily, with Kanon they avoid this problem, and whatever empathy or sadness I felt for the characters, it was because they were well built, not for the sake of it. While some characters lack true depth, I really don\u2019t have a problem with any of them. \\n\\n\r\nIf there\u2019s one thing I didn\u2019t lack how the show handled, it was the supernatural part of it. It just seemed like something thrown in there to increase the drama; because apart from when it was important to the plot, everything is typical slice-of-life. Now, the supernatural elements were OK in a anime like Clannad because they were used sparingly, just enough to give the show a sense of wonder(besides from that bullsh*t ending) but in Kanon they don\u2019t seem to really have a reason for it. OK Kanon, the fox girl I can buy, but by the time demons and ghosts are showing up, my tolerance is waning. If they wanted a supernatural theme, just make it an integral part of the show, not a catalyst for drama escalation! But I digress. \\n\\n\\n\r\n\tThe music for Kanon is really quite average. While it provides really nice ambience for the series, especially during the emotional bits, nothing here really is worth listening to on your own. As for animation, Kyoto Animation did a fantastic job. While character design in nothing of the beaten track(though that is probably more the visual novels fault more than Kyoto Ani\u2019s) the animation is lovely and high quality, as expected from this certain production studio.\\n\\n\r\n\tWhile not great, Kanon is still well worth your time if you\u2019re looking for a character driven drama. It\u2019s emotional, funny, and if you\u2019re suffering from a void from finishing your new favorite slice-of-life, probably one of the first things you should pick up. I didn\u2019t cover everything, like the lack of cohesion between the story arcs, or the amount of convenience that Yuichi would meet all these girls and make such a big impact that they would remember him like a decade later all in the span of this one visit to his aunt, but I\u2019m not going to fixate on it too much. It\u2019s good, you should watch it, and if you don\u2019t have a soul as black and dead as I do, you might just shed a tear or two. Till next time.\\n\\n\r\n\tFinal Verdict: 7(.5)/10\\n\\n\r\n\tP.S: So wait, she just recovered from that illness at the end without any explanation? Oh, nevermind.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFor this review and others, feel free to check out my blog! (Link on profile)\\n",

            "content": "Watching Kanon among all the hentai game adaptations like being dragged  to your grandma's dance party being shocked that it ain't bad.\r\nErotic visual novels... or Hentai games are they're better known, are not exactly  Shakespearean work. They typically feature some hopeless wuss boy, with way too much porno magazines under his bed and and a nose that donates vast amounts of blood whenever he seems some cleavage that's vaguely PG-13.\r\nAnd yet, for some unfathomable reason, this same hopeless guy would not only the object to sexual desire for a hot girl of every archetype, but also the school teacher (who happens to havevery large breasts), and his kid sister (who looks like they'll only hit puberty in the year 2099). Needless to say, Anime adaptations of such visual novels are generally not aimed for the Oscars.\\n\\n\r\nKanon, while not perfect,  is an unexpected gem that breaks all such traditions.\\n\\n\r\nSure, there's still a guy, Yuuichi, surrounded by many cute adoring girls. But for once, this is guy that actually *deserves* to be adored.  The dialogue in Kanon oozes with charm, and  Yuuichi is the master at cynical humour. Mix this with a dash of selflessness, and you've got a guy that you can actually see girls getting attracted to. For once, for the guys out there, this is probably one the only harem animes might improve your interactions with the opposite gender when you watch it.\\n\\n\r\nThis, combined with stunning visuals, a slow but serene soundtrack, a cast of memorable female characters, each with a story that can potentially bring out a tear, makes Kanon reign supreme as the king of animes featuring 5 different beautiful women adoring one man.\\n\\n\r\nAnd there lies Kanon's more problem... at its heart, it is still an adaptation of a hentai game. In these games, a player would make decisions, and end up with one girl. Once the girl's decided, there's very little interaction with any other. The anime adaptation attempts to details the story of every girl, and thus comes across as being a little disjointed. \\n\\n\r\nWhenever the story of one girl ends, she mysteriously vanishes from the series, as if the director fired the actor on the spot. What's more, with every girl pouring their heart out for Yuuichi, and squealing at the chance for a date, you would think that they'd get a little upset when he ends up with someone else. I'm not talking about school days here, but everyone getting along happily like 5 overly cute puppies around their master is a little far stretched.\\n\\n\r\nDespite this gripe, which in fairness, us hard to avoid. Kannon delivers. Not only is this the cream of hentai game adaptations, its also an hentai game adaptation that you can use to introduce a girl to anime, without them making up excuses like having to go dancing with their grandma the next time you meet.\\n",

            "content": "**SPOILER FREE REVIEW**\r\nKanon (2006) is one of the most beloved shoujo anime of all time; fans describe it as a touching, devastatingly sad storyline with memorable characters that make for a \"life-changing\" experience. It is highly regarded as a masterpiece that could make just about anyone cry. Well, long story short, Kanon didn't even come close to fulfilling that criteria for me thanks to one simple reason; nothing in this anime is relatable, believable, or genuine by any stretch of the imagination. This show demonstrates a complete misunderstanding of the very fundamental nature of human relationships, most notably the concept love. Rather then spilt thisreview into story, characters, sound, and art, I'm just going to go straight for why I didn't like this anime:\\n\\n\r\nThe\u00a0first problem is the characters. I don't know why the writer felt the need to write the female characters in such a way, but they are all the intellectual equivalents of a severely mentally handicapped person. Two of them in particular are so inept and immature that they literally cannot function as human beings without significant amounts of help. It gets so bad that at one point, one of the girls needs the protagonist, Yuuichi, to f*cking FEED her. Seriously. FEED her.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are unable to realize why that is a major problem, I'll go ahead and tell you: it's a major problem because this unrealistic sense of dependence and immaturity prevents Yuuichi from ever forming a normal, human relationship with any of the characters! The affection that Yuuichi develops for the other characters is comparable to the feelings you might have for a dog or cat; certainly not a human being (that turns out to be shockingly accurate for one character, haha). None of the connections between the characters feel meaningful or emotional in anyway because of how obnoxiously unrealistic the females are. Only one of them does not fall into this trap, and that one is a cardboard cut-out Yuki Nagato/Rei Ayanami clone who is completely devoid of any personality what so ever.\\n\\n\r\nThe second problem is the plot twists/major plot events. Kanon continued with it's theme of being unrealistic and unrelatable by drawing all of it's \"sad\" and \"emotional\" plot twists from sudden, tragic events that don't actually happen in real life! I can't go into detail about what these \"twists\" are, but lets just say they are poorly explained, they come out of nowhere, and they are completely fictional/supernatural.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nAgain, if you are unable to understand why this is a problem, I will explain again: If you are going to attempt to tell a love story or a story about friendship with the goal of making people sad because a tragic event happens, that only works if the tragic event is something believable that the viewer can relate to their real life! The reason that tragic moments in anime like the final story arc of Clannad: After Story worked and were legitimately sad was because the characters were relatable and the tragedies/plot twists that occurred were realistic and could actually happen! You actually were forced to sympathize with the characters because the relationships between them were real (for the most part), their environment was real, and their emotions were believable. Why couldn't Kanon have gone down that road? Instead, it simply relies on a bunch of supernatural crap that makes no sense and is more frustrating then it is sad. People can't sympathize with something that is not explained and not relatable to their lives in someway (unless they are just looking for a mindless excuse to cry).\\n\\n\r\nKanon does have its redeeming qualities I suppose, particularly the artwork. The animation in Kanon is stunning at times, but I'm not crazy bout the character design. I know that anime characters are supposed to have big eyes, but Kanon's female characters have heads that are about 50% eye. That is a bit absurd. The music was good, but not great. The OP is horrible, for example. Above average animation and music is simply not enough to save an anime from disturbingly horrible characters (Yuuichi is alright I guess) and poor writing decisions.\u00a0I don't see the appeal of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 2/10\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 2/10\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10",

            "content": "\"Can you promise me?\"\r\nThese are dangerous words, and the answer that may follow them is even more dangerous. Sometimes people say it carelessly and wont be able to keep that promise, specially kids, since they still don't know the impact some words might have.\r\nThis is the main focus of Kanon. Things that happened on the past and haven't been forgotten. Promises that were done, and haven't been kept.\r\nIt's a unusual but still very interesting theme, that fits perfectly with the style of drama-romance Key/Visual Art's have. For those who aren't familiar with their visual novels and anime adaptations yet, Kanon would be a nice start.It's above the average VisualNovel adaptations you usually find. Of course, just like any other anime adapted from a VN, it does follow that concept of dividing the story into \"arcs\" one for each character, however, Kanon did this is such a unique way that the story flows naturally making the storyline clean and easy to follow. It isn't slow paced neither rushed, and may be a little depressing but nothing like a roller-coaster of emotions. A soft and beautiful tale, that may move some to tears and others not.\\n\\n\r\nThis time, MAL did a really nice job in the summary for this series, I don't have much to add. It's concise and leaves that curiosity on the air. In order to not be repetitive I'll just do a brief introduction of it.\\n\r\nYuiichi is an average high-school boy who just arrived at a countryside town where always snows. He used to go there a lot when he was little, and he would always stay in his cousin's house. However, due to some issues that he doesn't remember very well himself, he stopped going there. Now, after these long years he returned to this city, and while the days go by he will start to remember some things and some people from his past.\\n\r\nBeing Key's 'winter' project it is interesting to find the symbolism into some elements of the story. Why a city where it is always snowing? What emotions can we attach to winter, sadness maybe? Melancholy? Nostalgia? Those metaphors are all around the series, mixes in light \"supernatural\" and \"fantasy\" elements.\\n\\n\r\nJust like that, each of the characters also have an symbolism attached to them. Most of them represent stereotypes of common anime series. The shy girl, the tsundere, the funny and friendly guy... Even though, as many may thing, they are not plain characters. These stereotypes are attached to them but what the anime wants to show is that people can, and will, eventually change. Along the series, lots of episodes are focused solely on character development and this is one of the strongest points of Kanon. It differs from most of the romance series, where only the main characters actually have some development.\\n\\n\r\nSomething nice to point out, is that this series from KyoAni is already a remake from an anime of 2002. Then, you might ask, \"why should I watch this one rather then the first?\".\\n\r\nThe answer I'd give is pretty simple:\\n\r\nBoth are based on the same VisualNovel so, despite minor differences and some changes on the ending, the story is the same. KyoAni could learn from the mistakes Toei Animation did, and improved the script, just like with a higher budget and a new technology they could go further on the animation, sound and artwork.\\n\r\nThis wasn't the first time they did an anime adaptation of a Key's VN, and the previously projects turned out really well, so, If I were you, I'd bet my chips on this one.\\n\\n\r\nLike that, the artwork and the soundtrack were a joy of sidekicks.\\n\r\nAll the light/filters effects KyoAni have in their arsenal made of artwork one of the strongest supporters for the story. This, allied with a diverse selection of piano pieces -sometimes in a cheerful mood and sometimes in a dark and sadder tone- with also a strong opening increases the emotional factor the story carries.\\n\r\nBeing I one of those people who gives a lot of value for this two topics, it is great when I can say honestly in a review that the anime managed to blend all of them very well.\\n\r\nNo complains here.\\n\\n\r\nEven though, Kanon does have some broken strings and loose ends.\\n\r\nOne of the biggest problems studios face while adapting a VN to anime is how will they write the ending. In the Visual Novel you have lots of alternative endings, each for a character or situation. During the anime producers could choose into animating all routes but when it comes to an end it needs to be decided which one will be \"the one\". They could select one or merge them all but always considering the pace of the story.\\n\r\nHere is where Kanon messes up a bit with the great story that was developed so far. Close to the end it becomes really slow paced, in a way someone with a small attention spam would soon find it boring. Just for in the last couple of episodes, finish in a incredibly fast mood. It suddenly switch from a calm pace to a very rushed final episode, making all that storyline that was elaborated throughout the whole series be obfuscated by an predicable ending. Leaving for you just that bad taste of \"what? Oh. It's over.\"\\n\\n\r\nBesides, Kanon do strikes again even in that messed ending.\\n\r\nIt doesn't try to impose emotions or feels on you like some other dramas when it comes to emotional scenes. The scenes flows naturally with a clear OST that isn't forceful which is great because this way you don't loose the focus.\\n\\n\r\nSometimes, people like refer to Kanon as \"Clannad's OVA\" or \"Clannad little sister\".\\n\r\nWhile it is funny to say that, you must be very careful if you will make an assumption like that. It is not something nice to say for someone who is new to anime, because that person won't get what you're trying to say and will loose his/her interest in this series.\\n\r\nBoth animes do share some characteristics. The setting of the story is similar and also some characters. As you would expect from two stories that share the same author. However, I would say Clannad is a romance with drama, while Kanon is a drama with romance. Both for those with strong hearts!\\n\r\nOverall, it is a story everyone should watch. And watch open minded, appreciating the ideals the story is trying to share.\\n\\n\r\nJust a end-of-review curiosity, The series name comes from the title of an composition by a german baroque composer called Pachelbel. Pachelbel's Kanon. (\"Canon/Kanon\" stands for a style, where a main melody is followed by several \"imitations\" of it, like if it is being repeated, just with crescendos and tempo variations).\\n\r\nReminds the series opening?\\n\r\nCoincidentally or not, another famous baroque arrangement is named \"-Air- on the G string\" another Key's title.\\n\\n\r\nAs always, thank you for your time! ...And yes. We all agree this kind of eroge-adapted harem is kinda clich\u00e9. But what can you do? They are also addicting as fuck!",

            "content": "There is most likely typos, but please try to overlook them.\r\nWhat lies before us here is an unique anime which is sure to leave deep marks in your heart, and make you create emotions you didn't know you even possessed.\r\nThe Anime Kanon 2006 is an adaption of a visual novel with the same name created by the company key.\r\nAlthough I haven't played the game, I can mention that it was created in 1999. This means that you shouldn't by any means compare this anime to the other adaptions of key's works (Clannad, Air & Little Busters) as Kanon was created earlier than the beforementioned. (Especiallyon things such as character design, personality and plot in general)\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nI gave the story a straight 10/10 grade. The different arcs within this series is perfectly entwined together and goes by extremely smoothly. The plotline of the show circles around the protagonist \"Yuuichi\", who travels back to his cousin's town, which he used to visit in his childhood years. The story is brought forward by the past being more and more unraveled, while Yuuichi creates deeper relationships with the heroines of the story. The supernatural aspects of the story enhances the mysterious mood which the anime tries to create.\\n\\n\r\nBy the end of the anime you will gasp and think how everything fit together. The rewatch value of this show is very high, as you might need some time to assemble all the pieces together.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nAs for character art, that's something entirely subjective. Even though you might prefer smaller eyes or more mature looking characters, I can objectively conclude that the characters are drawn very detailed. The hair and clothes have a lot of small details which enrichens the visual experience. The animation is very fluid, and the backgrounds fits the mood perfectly. If you watch the show in 1080p your eyes might have an experience of euphoria.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe music in Kanon is made by the Jun Maeda. He is known for composing key's music and his works are in the highest tier.\\n\r\nA majority of the music consists of many calming and sad tunes which is mainly performed on piano, while some is using music box. Different ambient and semi-jazzy tracks is also featured. For music lovers such as myself this grade weights pretty hard, and the music is absolutely remarkable.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED is very captivating, where the OP is more on the sad side while the ED creates a more positive mood. While the show is overall pretty tearshredding, the ED helps you to maintain a feeling of hope.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nOn my part this weights the most when I'm rating anime. The protagonist is Kanon is a lighthearted person which is incredibly easy to like.\\n\r\nAs for the heroines of the story, they are all extremely unique. Most of the heroines in the anime is rather mysterious, and very likeable overall. The character developement is brought forward very nicely, and the relationship between the characters is given a lot of thought on beforehand. The wide range of personalities and distinctiv behaviors of the characters in the series creates a lot of variety, and I can ensure you that you're gonna love at least 2 or 3 of the characters in the story.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nWhen I first watched the show in 2012 I hadn't shed a tear for many years. After completing the series I broke down in a hour of constantly crying. That was the feeling of fulfillment I had. The show sure made a great impact on me, and my life ended up being changed.\\n\\n\r\nAs for who that will enjoy this show, I dare to say that it fits for everyone.(above 14~ years, as the show is rather complex) The show features thrilling moments, a lot of sad moments and moments where you will sit in you chair and smile like an idiot for minutes.\\n\r\nThe romance in the series is remarkable compared to other series in the \"harem\" genre and also generally. Although the show is not tagged as a slice of life, I would say that it also fulfills your needs of getting a close view on the characters daily life. The series will satisfy mystery lovers to the degreed that you might not sit on the chair and wonder who the murder is, but rather figuring out how everything is put together.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\r\nBy giving 10 in all the other categories, one can easily figure out that the final rating will be 10/10. The anime is of extremely high quality and everyone should have it in their shelf collection. For me the hours I used to watch the show was the most appreciated hours before the screen of all time. (at least if we take in mind TV shows and everything being displayed on the TV)\\n\\n\r\nI hope this review was helpful, I'm not experienced with writing reviews and this was my first go.\\n\r\nI appreciate feedback on stuff that could've been done better. I might have been unclear on some parts and I apologise for that.\\n\\n\r\nAt last I wish you a nice day and a good watch~",

            "content": "\"It's called a miracle because it never happens.\" - Misaka Shiori\r\nThis review could contain some spoilers if you have not watched Clannad.\r\nKanon (2006) or Kanon for short, as a whole is a riveting story, but it left me wanting a bit more, no, I don't mean it in a good way. I'll explain it soon.\r\nStory: You have Yuuichi Aizawa, who returns to a city he used to visit after being gone for several years. He lives with his cousin Nayuki, and goes to school with her. As soon as he transfers to her school, that's when things begin to ravel, and he recollects his past.I won't explain much because I'm afraid I might spoil, but the synopsis is there for you. The story is a very entertaining one if you're a fan of drama and romance. The episodes are set up nicely, leaving you wanting to watch the next one. Don't let the cliches early in the series drive you away, as the rest of the series can change your mind about it. Keep in mind that this series has 'Supernatural' as one of the genres, so try not to judge this with realism. This may be slow paced for some people, but comparing this to Clannad (which you should not fully compare it to), the story runs at a much quicker pace.\\n\r\nRating: 9\\n\\n\r\nComparing to Clannad: I think Clannad is more popular than Kanon, so more people probably have watched that first. Keep in mind that Clannad was aired a couple of months after Kanon was done, so the similarities between the two are very high. The plot between the two are not 100% identical, but this being a Key visual novel adaptation, well I'm not saying anymore. What I'm saying is you shouldn't compare those two thinking it's the absolute same thing. The difference I can say about Kanon is that the drama and conflict isn't as forced as After Story.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The development between Yuuichi and the other characters was pretty good, but I think could have been improved on some characters. However, it's just enough to make you know a lot about them, know their relationships between the main character, and understand their feelings. The conflict and drama of Kanon really hit you hard, and that's what kept me interested in this series.\\n\r\nRating: 9\\n\\n\r\nSound: To start Kanon, Last Regrets is played as the opening, which I think is really fitting to the series and is a great song in general. However, the soundtrack is the real thing. Some of the tracks are from the visual novel, but everything is fitting throughout. Oh yeah, Canon in D.\\n\r\nRating: 10\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is comparable to Air, and looks almost identical to Clannad (e.g. Ayu looks a lot like Fuko), but nonetheless, the animations are just as good.\\n\r\nRating: 9\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: Kanon (2006) was a really enjoyable series to watch. The drama keeps you glued to your seat, and also makes you tear up in many moments. Though it left me wanting more, and supernatural elements playing a role, I was very satisfied with series, and would recommend it to anyone.\\n\r\nOverall Rating: 9",

            "content": "WOW...was my first reaction when I finished watching Kanon. IMO this is one of the BEST drama/romance animes you can watch. With amazing animation quality, incredible and touching storyline, the dynamic Key/Kyoto duo, and a bunch of super moe characters, Kanon 2006 quickly took a spot as one of my top animes and my reasons for it are:\r\nStory: Just like previous Key/KyoAni production Air, Kanon was mainly divided into different arcs for the different girls and each took a set number of episodes to unfold, each one bringing some sort of tragic or mysterious chain of events on our main character. I obviously have arcsthat I liked more than others but as a whole when you put Kanon's stories together you realize that you have just witnessed an amazing show with one of the most touching stories you can find out there. I dont wanna sound manly or anything but I have never cried while watching an anime, but Kanon 2006 has come the closest ever to making me cry for an animated character, while watching I would start to get teary eyed at the most sensitive moments and for that Kanon has a special place in me. I rounded down but my original score would be 9.4/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: With Kanon Kyoto Animation once again proved that they are kings of animation and production quality. All characters in Kanon were just amazingly well drawn and their animation were fluent and you could hardly ever see a scene where the animation would drop. Being in a city of snow, the colours of Kanon were not as bright and impressive as Air but that does not mean Kanon looked bad, all the colours used in Kanon were also bright and the show as a whole was really pretty to look at. The score of 10 stands and for a good reason.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I never really pay that much attention to sound when I watch animes but the musical backgrounds in Kanon mixed with the tragic events result in some of the most touching moments I've seen.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: When it comes to characters Kanon has plenty to choose from, with 5 main heroines and plenty of side characters Kanon is not lacking in this department. And did I mention every single one of them are just WAY TO CUTE! Kyoto has done a really great job at drawing them all and every one of them comes with a different personality resulting in the main character acting completely different towards each of them. Also since Kanon is a 24 episode series they had more time to introduce and develop each character more than in Air's 12 ep series (ep 13 does not count). The resulting mix gives you a show where you can really get emotionally attached to a character and when seeing their stories unfold you actually feel bad/good for them when an event occurs.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Despite having been depressed by this show's story many times, I can easily say that Kanon 2006 has been one of my favourite anime and I still rewatch some moments if I need some sadness in my life O_o\\n\\n\r\nOverall the second Key/Kyoto anime has been an incredible one and it shows that when you mix Key's amazing storytelling with Kyoto's amazing animation, the end result is an anime that will amaze you with the story and will drawn you in with their looks. Kanon 2006 is definitely a show that no one should miss even if you do not like the drama/romance shows, this is one of the few shows I've given a 10/10 it's that good.",

            "content": "This is the anime that changed my point of view about love-romace-slice of life anime types. I've watched the whole Kyoto Animation-Key-Visual Art's set: Air, Clannad, and this one. I'm reviewing this one because of all the other ones (that are masterpieces as well) I really think that Kanon has to be the best between them all, also this is one of my favourites and best animes of all time.\r\nNow the story is something different from one's is used to watch, is actually the base of the success for this anime. The context of the plot is Visual Art's presentation card, they always attempt todevelop the story line the same way around: \"a boy who returns to a place he had been before, a long time ago. He doesn't remember much about it, but as he interacts with the other characters (mostly females) he finds out that he had relations with those characters in the past and, in the end, remembers it all\". Bassicaly the anime storyline is all about the importance of memories for a human being. It might sound a little to stupid but the way Visual Art's Key puts all the characters, locations and artistic material together is just so good that the story goes from stupid to a really serious and complex one and ends up being film-worthy. \\n\\n\r\nThe pace of the story may seen slow at first but when the main events from each arc do take place the quantity of information from each one is so big to digest that it feels like the story has passed from one arc to another way too fast and, when you finally finish watching the anime, you just can't wait to watch it again because you thought you didn't get the whole story. There are some magical, supernatural conflicts in this anime, but they just have the right amount of credibility in them to be part of the slice of life theme in the anime. Also (including the said supernatural and magical themes) the story has the whole package: romance, drama, humor and some, really often, heartbreaking passages that will make sure you keep your tissue pack near you until the anime is over for good. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime just looks perfect. The design of the characters and spaces are Kyoto Animation's and Key's masterwork. The city looks so colourful and real. From the buildings, to the outskirts houses, the school halls and the woods. So you could say that the city has it's own personality. The characters appereance is in a different level that most animes are. They are just so full of life, every movement is highly detailed and beautifully expressed, also the psychical aspects give each character it's own unique impression on the viewer. This is definitely a successfull formula that has worked in Air and Clannad, none other anime appeals artistically to me as much as this one does.  \\n\\n\r\nFrom the opening song to each charater's voice acting the sound is just right. The songs used in this anime are all (as you can imagine) slow and sad but of course this matches perfectly the theme setting. The voice acting is very convincing and I love that the voices sound taken just from the streets, they sound like normal persons talking to each other and the voice acting has nothing to do with elaborate voices or appealing voices, just normal voices which express the emotions of the characters in a very realistic way. So the sound is not perfect but superior from most stardard animes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are the handling that connects the base and gives it stability. I have to say that the characters this anime offers are one of the most amazing I have ever seen. Everything is perfect about them from the looks to the unique personality of each one, no doubt this is a Kyoto Animation's and Key's work. Starting with exuberant hair colors and finishing with big lively eyes the characters look so original, so different from any other anime series that, after you watch this, all the other animes will look either bad or weird. The personality of each character is just a variety of what you would find if you walk around the streets and watch any one around (of course they have that \"japaneese shy factor\" if you know what I mean). I noticed that all the female leads (except Mai) have a characteristic weird sound in they're dialect (you know the Uguuuu!, Nyuuuu! or Auuuu!). This really does make the characters more different one from another, being this like a characteristic \"spark\" each one has, but at the same time it connects all of them creating a sort of invisible bond between them.\\n\\n\r\nWell Here you have it: this is what a mix of a perfect story, art, characters, a great sound and a HUGE enjoyment factor gives as a result: a masterpiece. I didn't like this type of anime before I watched this. I always went to see the most gory and bloody anime I could find. So even if you think you don't like this kind of animes I advise you: watch this and try to say the same thing again after you had finished it. If you don't watch Kanon you are missing a unique experience in animation, a incomparable experience. The only problem I found is that, after finishing the anime, you will look down at any other anime of this type and always will compare it to this one and, for once, let's be real: there is almost nothing out there that you can compare with this anime, Kanon it's just in a whole different level.",

            "content": "\"We don't remember days- we remember moments. The richness of life lies in memories we have forgotten\" -Makoto Sawatari\r\nI have never before felt so ambivalent about a show, or writing a review for one. Generally speaking, by the end of the show, my opinions on it have solidified, and it's fairly cut and dried whether I liked it, disliked it, or really couldn't care less one way or the other.\r\n...Then I saw Kanon. \r\nThere are so many things that Kanon gets right, and at the same time, many other things that it does wrong, and that I just have a very hard time forgiving. PerhapsI'm guilty of thinking about it too hard, but we shall see. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArtwork and Animation: 7\\n\\n\r\nWhen you mention Air or Kanon, sometimes people will look at you funny, like \"You actually watched that Toei produced trash?\", but this is the Kyoto Animation version. You can clarify which one you saw very easily by saying, \"It's the one with the bug people\", and everyone will instantly know. \\n\\n\r\nYes, those enormous, compound eyed girls are back! They take front and center in Kanon. I even went into photoshop and took the area of Ayu's eyes divided by the area of her face, and 16.7% of her head is eyeball. 16.7%! \\n\\n\r\nJokes aside, the artwork in Kanon is good. The show is nearly 10 years old, and it holds up well against modern productions, while retaining the signature Kyoto feel. Expect a lot of nice natural backdrops (in the snow, no less- an excellent Christmas break anime) and cityscape. The characters always maintain a great level of detail, and everything is fairly well polished. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound and Voice Acting: 10\\n\\n\r\nI'm going to be honest here; I think Kanon probably has one of, if not THE best written dialogues I've ever heard in an anime series. The outstanding performances of the totally aside, the writing is a star in its own right here. The dialogue, while cheesy when appropriate, actually feels like real people talking to each other, conversing, throwing snide comments at each other, being indignant, the emotional highs, crushing lows, and everything that the characters go through that comes out auditorily hits every bit of the mark. \\n\\n\r\nMy hat is off to Chris Patton (Greed, FMA/B) for his portrayal of Yuichi. I don't think I've ever before identified with a character as much as Yuichi. Everything about the performance is fantastic. I don't mean this in a fan-rant kind of way, as this is my first exposure to Patton as a main character, but the nuance and feeling he put into the role is admirable. Yuichi really feels like that sarcastic, smart mouth friend. The delivery and timing of the jokes is impeccable as well- again, an excellently flowing dialogue that has few peers in the anime realm.\\n\\n\r\nBrittney Karbowski appears as Ayu- and also does a great job portraying the immature little genki girl whose innocence and na\u00efvet\u00e9 know no bounds. It's an endearing performance, for a little twit that started off as the annoying little sister character. \\n\\n\r\nEven Greg Ayres, as smoked out as he always sounds, showed out in a smaller supporting role. ADV did an outstanding job with both casting and direction of the performances.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters : 9\\n\\n\r\nWhen I said above that I didn't think I'd ever seen a character that I identified with as much as I did with Yuichi, I mean that the character of Yuichi is almost a direct transplant of my own personality. Watching Kanon was almost like watching a show with a self-insert protagonist, and easily allowed me to empathize with Yuichi. \\n\\n\r\nYuichi is that kind hearted jerk that you just can't help but like. He's always armed with a snappy comeback and sometimes takes his caustic jokes too far, but he always means well, even when mercilessly mocking his cousin Nayuki or friends. No one is safe from the snark, and Yuichi lets it fly. \\n\\n\r\nDespite his seemingly uncaring outward facade, deep inside, Yuichi is a very caring and devoted friend. The conflicts of the show revolve around the rough times that happen to him and his little group of friends, and each time, he's there for the affected party, and tries his best to be able to be sympathetic, but without being obsequious or fake. He's not a sycophantic slave boy to this collection of attractive girls he befriends; but rather a concerned and dependable brother type figure.\\n\\n\r\nIt goes without saying that the hero has to earn his happy ending (especially in a Key written Visual Novel, and Yuichi is put through a lot throughout the course of Kanon. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the other characters in the show, there are stronger ones, and weaker ones. Each has their distinctive arc in the story, and far be it from me to spoil the results of any of them, but I found the ones with Shiori, Nayuki, and Ayu to be among the stronger ones. It also helped that they were stacked more at the end of the show than the beginning. \\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5 \\n\\n\r\nAgain with firsts, I think this is the first show that I've assigned a near perfect score to characters, and a poor one to the story, but there's a very good reason for this, and my biggest gripe about Kanon in general. \\n\\n\r\nMagic. \\n\\n\r\nI understand that the show is based on the idea of \"miracles can happen\", and it's built on a cycle of character buildup, ensuing relationship, and then some kind of heartbreaking event for the characters involved. It's been used in an uncountable amount of media- some of the greatest films and literature pieces of all time use it to great effect, and it's one of the tried and true ways to make a heartfelt or tearjerker drama when done correctly. \\n\\n\r\nThe only addition to this formula that Kanon makes is the addition of a supernatural element. \\n\\n\r\nLike, they could just swap out \"this character isn't human and is dying because they can't maintain their human form\" for \"this character has an incurable, rare hereditary disease and is going to die\" and it would work ABSOLUTELY perfectly without changing anything in the show- not even the dialogue. I just cannot for the life of me understand why it has to be a supernatural cause for the illnesses of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nI hated this device in Air, and I hate it in Kanon. All they had to do was just make the characters have a scientific/medical reason for why they're ill and be done with it. It's realistic, it's tragic, and moreover, it might actually make me feel something. \\n\\n\r\nIt's not as though the writers at Key (or even Kyoto, if they changed details somewhat) are ABOVE using the \"incurable illness\" as a plot device, either, because it appears in this show too!! And guess what? I actually felt something. I genuinely felt bad for the character, and you know what? The other characters in the show did too. To a much more believable degree than for the 'shapeshifting' character, certainly. \\n\\n\r\nI cannot feel ANYTHING for some spiritual being pretending to be a person that was never human to begin with. It completely removes the all-important HUMAN element. I don't even know that the character is capable of feeling human emotions/moods/or complex brain chemical reactions known as \"love\". \\n\\n\r\n-~-\\n\\n\r\nKanon is one of those shows that, on the surface, is very sweet- but falls apart pretty quickly once you start thinking about it. \\n\\n\r\nThe next issue it has, and it's one I'm willing to overlook not only because it's so centric to the story, but because it's also one of the best parts, (but I feel it needs mention,) is an illusionary/wrong memory of a character. Another aspect of the conflict of the show is that Yuichi has lost his memories of his time spent in the city where all of this takes place, because the last time he was there 7 years ago, a traumatic event occurred, and as a result, he repressed his memories of his old friends and the times they had and spends the story recovering them.\\n\\n\r\nI absolutely refuse to believe that EVERY person in the story went along with Yuichi's delusions of the existence of this character, for several reasons. \\n\\n\r\nThere is physical evidence that this character exists, not to mention that other characters speak directly to this character. It's not like a movie where the main character believes that someone else is with them and performing the actions for them while they spectate, no, other characters besides the main character interact with this person. \\n\\n\r\nThere cannot be two of this character, due to the fact that (for the sake of the ending of the arc) this character appears again (difficult to describe this point without spoilers). As Shiro Emiya once said: \"People die when they're killed\". Also, how Yuichi manages to find an item that was apparently not given to the character as he falsely and incorrectly remembered, yet other characters comment on this character having said item. \\n\\n\r\nThere is no way anyone could go along with such an elaborate lie, unless (from an unseen perspective) Yuichi also acts out as the character he's hallucinating about, period. Yuichi explaining all the personality quirks and mannerisms of this illusory character in such an extreme detail to anyone who would have had any bearing on the story and \"remembers\" this character is just ludicrous to imagine. Again, this is where thinking about it too hard really causes Kanon to fall apart. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall: 7, 7\\n\\n\r\nI can't hate Kanon- I actually really want to like it, because the main character is the anime incarnation of myself, and the plot has several sweet moments that were rather touching; but it's just so hard to overlook the screwy plot devices in the story. \\n\\n\r\nKanon has, simultaneously, one of the best written comedy dialogues I've seen in an anime, and one of the absolute worst plot devices, ever. There are some beautiful moments and cute characters in it- I can see why it's held up as a classic heartwarming tale for the cold winter months. It definitely has an emotional appeal to it that a lesser show would have to kick two kittens and kill a lot of little moe girl characters to achieve, all while managing to be a cohesive, flowing tale. (adapting 5 routes of a VN in 24 episodes is no mean feat- especially considering Fate Stay Night is on pace for around 80 episodes for three.) \\n\\n\\n\r\nRecommend? \\n\\n\r\nYes. Where I disliked Air for the misuse of supernatural and a tangential, tacked on plot that goes nowhere, Kanon refines this and brings it back down to Earth. It's a much better paced, has much more interesting characters, and a sweet story that makes it easy to watch and hard to put down. \\n\\n\\n\r\nTl;dr\\n\\n\r\n+ Great MC, especially for fans of the deadpan snarker\\n\r\n+ Outstanding dialogue and comedy writing; among the best\\n\\n\r\n+/- Mixed story arc appeal- some are much weaker than others, especially as far as believability goes\\n\\n\r\n- Misuse of \"magic\" when it could have easily been substituted out for legitimate scientific/medical reasons. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThanks for the read, feel free to drop me a comment when you feel that fanboy/girl rage building up- or say something nice.",

            "content": "\"...It's a promise.\"\r\nI remember, about a year ago, I watched Kanon 2006. It was good and all, but at the time, I just finished watching Clannad: After Story, which became my favorite anime ever (and still is). Because of that, all I did was compare Kanon to Clannad. And because of that I didn't like it very much. I soon forgot about Kanon, and whenever it was brought up in conversation, I always said, \"Just watch Clannad. It's the same as Kanon, except 10 times better lolz.\"\r\n...What an idiotic statement that is.\r\nI recently rewatched Kanon, and decided not to compare it to Clannad at all.And what would you know, I ended up enjoying it. A lot. So much so, in fact, that I immediately put it in my favorites list here on MAL, and I don't see myself removing it anytime soon.\\n\r\nWhy did I enjoy watching Kanon so much? Well, not comparing it to Clannad did help a little, but it honestly is just an amazing series.\\n\r\nTouching drama. Hilarious and adorable comedy. Heartwarming moments that made me cry. This anime has all of that. Not only all of that, though, but the cast of characters in Kanon are so lovable and wonderful, as well... I don't know where to start!\\n\r\nWell, let's get story out of the way, shall we?\\n\\n\r\n~STORY~ The story in Kanon does start off pretty basic: Yuuichi Aizawa moves into a town that he hasn't visited for 7 years. He moves in with his cousin, Nayuki, and his aunt, Akiko. Throughout the series there are several arcs, focusing on each female character. This is the basic layout of quite a few visual novel anime adaptations, I will admit. Where the story truly shines though are the arcs that have to do with those female characters I briefly mentioned, and the relationships Yuuichi forms with each of them. And all of the arcs, literally all 5 or so of them, made me tear up. Some of them are truly sad and bittersweet, and the way they are presented is spectacular. They are all really quite original, as well. You won't see some of these stories in other slice of life anime. Some of the arcs are so original and farfetched, even, that some viewers might be thrown off by them. I personally didn't have any problem with it, as I kind of expect some supernatural stories in Key anime at this point. I really like them, actually.\\n\\n\r\n~CHARACTERS~ As mentioned previously, the characters in Kanon are great. Especially at the time that the visual novel was made (1999), they were, and I'd claim that they still are, pretty original. Some, like Ayu, may seem like a typical cutesy moe character, and you'd be kinda right. But their stories are truly unique. I grew so attached to these characters. There are quite a lot, so I won't go into TOO much detail with all of them (however, I will talk about them, so stay tuned), but I feel like I should at least go into detail about Yuuichi and Ayu.\\n\\n\r\n~ Yuuichi ~ He's the main character. I liked him so much because he is a sarcastic bastard who loves to mess around with the girls. His exchanges with some of the characters, like Ayu in particular, are hilarious. But you can just tell that he does care deeply for all of the characters... he truly does. You can feel all the pain and guilt that he feels. And then you can also LOL when he makes a joke. One of my favorite slice of life protagonists.\\n\r\nAlso, shout out to Chris Patton. He was excellent as Yuuichi.\\n\\n\r\n~ Ayu ~ UGUU That is all...\\n\r\nNah, I'm kidding. I said I'd go into detail, didn't I? And there's more to her than just her 'catchphrase.' She is a very loud character, which may annoy some. But the appeal to her loudness is that she is just so cute and fun. Ayu is very playful, and has some of the best moments and conversations with Yuuichi in the series. This may sound odd, too, but she really is such a 'bro' in most of the arcs (I don't mean that she looks or acts like a boy, although Yuuichi does tease her about that. I trust that you're smart enough to know what I mean. I'm just not smart enough to find the right word for it haha). You can almost always count on her to cheer you, and Yuuichi, up in some of the darker moments of the series.\\n\r\nNot only that, but there is a mystery surrounding her... and her past with Yuuichi...\\n\\n\r\nSo those are the two main protagonists. Other characters, such as Kaori and Aunt Akiko, get a lot of screen time in most of the arcs, as well, and you do grow to like them a ton. And then of course, other female characters get the spotlight in different arcs, as well. These characters are:\\n\\n\r\n~ Nayuki ~ \"Do you still remember my name?\"\\n\r\n- Yuuichi\u2019s cousin and the captain of the track team, she is not a morning person and always seems kinda sleepy. She is incredibly adorable.\\n\\n\r\n~ Makoto ~ \"When spring comes...it would be nice if it would last forever.\" \\n\r\n- A girl who lost her memories and likes to mess with Yuuichi. There is a lot more to her than that, but spoilers. That goes for practically all of these characters, by the way.\\n\\n\r\n~ Mai ~ \"...I'm a demon hunter.\" \\n\r\n- A quiet and cold beauty who mysteriously comes to school at night with a sword and claims that she fights demons...\\n\\n\r\n~ Shiori ~ \"It's called a miracle because it doesn't happen.\" \\n\r\n- A girl who is absent from school a lot because of some apparent cold. But, for some reason, she stands alone on the school courtyard everyday, saying that she is waiting to meet someone... \\n\\n\r\nThe arcs tie together quite nicely, and don't seem out of place. The characters develop over the course of each arc, and although not all of the arcs have the happiest of endings, they sure are quite satisfying. I always want to see how Yuuichi will deal with these situations, and how they will change him.\\n\r\nAnd lastly, I'd like to mention Kitagawa: he's the funny 'best friend' character of this series, and he gets a decent amount of screentime. The reason why I like him is, and this is the only time I will compare Kanon to Clannad, don't worry; the reason why I liked him is that he felt a lot like Sunohara, which is pretty awesome because Sunohara is my favorite best friend character of all time. Kitagawa was funny and cared for his friends, and he has a LOT more character and personality in this anime than he did in the visual novel, so I give KyoAni props for that.\\n\\n\r\n~ART/ANIMATION~ KyoAni did an amazing job with the art and animation. They actually made Yuuichi look like a human being (unlike that... other... thing that was made in 2002), and the girls are beautiful. The animation, for 2006, is really smooth and looks decent even by today's standards. It's excellent, and a pleasure to look at. It's not an eyegasm, like Nagi no Asukara, for example, but for the year it was made in, it's pretty great.\\n\\n\r\n~SOUND~ I'll get this out of the way: the dub is actually really good. I already said this, but I'll say it again: Chris Patton was awesome as Yuuichi, and made him a more likable character. Brittney Karbowski was also a pretty good Ayu, but I wouldn't say that her performance as Ayu is better than Yui Horie's. The dub isn't as moe, or cute, as the Japanese version, but if you're okay with that, then the dub should be fine.\\n\r\nThe sub is also amazing, so no problems there. Stick with sub if you want more adorable voices for the female characters.\\n\r\nThe OST for this anime is very bouncy and peppy during the normal slice of life moments. The more touching scenes have more emotional music, so it all fits nicely, no song seems out of place. The OST is really good, and I listen to it on YouTube from time to time.\\n\r\nThe OP is very slow and calming, and it's really quite beautiful. The first couple of notes really give off the feeling of winter. The ED is a very nice and happy song. I didn't ever skip either of them. To sum it up, the sound is also quite great.\\n\\n\r\nSo, all in all, Kanon is a beautiful anime, it really is. It's one of the best Key anime to date. But it can be a bit slow near the beginning for some, and especially during Mai and Makoto's arc, it can be a bit confusing and farfetched. And then I do have to mention that some people may not like Key's artstyle, so be wary of that (I personally love it though). But I assure you it all pays off in the end with it's cast of heartwarming characters, emotional and bittersweet story arcs, and great animation and OST.\\n\\n\r\nHere are my ratings:\\n\\n\r\n-Story ~ 8 ~\\n\r\n-Characters ~ 9 ~\\n\r\n-Art ~ 9 ~\\n\r\n-Animation ~ 8 ~\\n\r\n-Sound ~ 9 ~\\n\r\n-Enjoyment ~ 10 ~\\n\\n\r\nKanon has become one of my favorite anime. I am so happy that I rewatched it, and I will rewatch it many more times in the future. I hope anyone else who watches it finds this anime to be as wonderful as I did.",

            "content": "Kanon is a very special anime. I enjoyed it a lot despite the obvious major flaws it has. The flaws are so big that they would ruin almost any other anime. Kanon endured it. \r\nThe story takes place in some small Japanese town in the middle of winter. 17-years old Yuuichi Aizawa comes to the town with an intention to study at local high school. His cute blue-haired cousin accommodates him. It's been 7 years since Yuuichi had last visited this town. Strangely, he doesn't remember anything from 7 years ago. During his stay in the town, he befriends several girls: hyperactive Makoto, lonely Shiori,quiet Mai and immature Ayu. As he is helping them with their struggles, he starts to remember his previous stay in the town. Little by little. \\n\\n\r\nThe good:\\n\\n\r\nThe reason why Kanon is held in such high regard is by far the emotional impact. The anime floods the viewer with emotions in every single episode, especially in the last few ones. Another really good aspect of the anime is the art. In fact, it looks beautiful. As the anime is set in winter, most of the time we see the snow falling, but even such common scenery can look delightful. The afternoon scenes were even prettier; the sunlight was done neatly. Character art was solid, too. Perhaps their eyes could be a little smaller, but that's a nitpick. \\n\\n\r\nEvery anime of course needs a good soundtrack. And Kanon has it. The music is tranquil all the time, you won't find any fist-pumping tunes here. It's for the best, though, as the music perfectly fits the story and art. Let's move to the bad now.\\n\\n\r\nThe bad:\\n\\n\r\nI have a lot to say about the bad aspects of Kanon. First and foremost, Yuuichi sucks. His relationship with every girl I mentioned above seems like a relationship of two lovers. But then he helps the girl and moves on to another one. The one he helped before is completely forgotten as he is helping another one. Then in the end, he decides that he loves just one of them. They fall in love almost instantly without so much as a few episodes for their relationship to evolve.\\n\\n\r\nThat also shows that the pattern of the series is not done well. As with most anime, it's divided into arcs. In each arc, the main characters are Yuuichi and one of the girls. The pattern is like this: Yuuichi and the girl meet --> the next few episodes are about Yuuichi helping her --> they get extremely close --> Yuuichi remembers some of his memories --> problem is solved --> move on to another girl and forget about the previous one.\\n\\n\r\nAnother flaw is the unreality. I don't even mean the supernatural actions that occur here and there. What I mean is that for a slice of life anime, the characters don't act like real people at all. Yuuichi's total amnesia is quite stupid as well. He doesn't remember a lot of important things.\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally, the most appealing trait of Kanon is also what it drags down. The emotionality is overblown. It's too melodramatic. The characters get teary-eyed because of sentiments. Certain emotional scenes are repeated too much. All in all, it could be done with less tears.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:  \\n\\n\r\nIt probably looks like I hate this anime but no, I genuinely like it actually. It just has those flaws that are impossible to overlook plus I really wanted to comment on them. Kanon was not an easy anime to watch, but when i finished watching it, I couldn't help myself. The emotional impact was big and that's what it's supposed to be about.\\n\\n\r\nPS: note how I wrote this review without mentioning Clannad.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "\"Do you know the title of this song? It's Canon. Pachelbel's Canon. It repeats the same melody and crescendos gradually, peacefully, and beautifully. It would be nice if life changed like that: slowly but surely, while being seemingly unchanged from day to day.\"\r\n\u2014 Kurata Sayuri\r\nKanon 2006, if you don't already know, is the second attempt at adapting Key's 1999 visual novel  into the anime format.  I've not yet seen the original 2002 anime, but the visual novel was actually my first visual novel ever, and since reading it, I've watched the 2006 anime twice.  Needless to say, I wouldn't have watched 48episodes of anime if I didn't like the story.  So why the relatively low score?  Well, MAL's suggested rating scale calls 7/10 \"good,\" so there's that, but why not a 10/10 masterpiece?  Read on, and I'll explain myself.\\n\\n\r\nMAL suggests 5 categories for judging in reviews: story, art, sound, character, and enjoyment.  So first off, I'll discuss the story.  You already have a synopsis written for you on the anime's page, so I'll just boil it down to \"17 year old boy moves back to the town he left when he was 10, doesn't really remember anything, acquires harem of girls, drama ensues.\"  Now, the anime improved pretty greatly on the visual novel in some areas, which I'll get to later, but the story suffered a bit from the adaptation.  In the visual novel, there are five different story routes, one per heroine, and the choices you make decide which route you follow.  Each route takes place primarily in the month of January, and has its own dramatic and romantic happenings that don't usually bleed into other routes.  It works very well, and the stories of the individual routes (or character arcs, in the anime adaptation) are generally quite good.  Two routes in particular -- I won't say which -- stood out above the rest, in my eyes, in the visual novel, though one of those two (the one that affected me most in the visual novel, unfortunately) suffered a bit in the anime.  The other is still phenomenal, and I still teared up at one point despite having already experienced it twice before -- the first time, I have to admit, I bawled my eyes out >.> And that wasn't the only time, either. If there's one thing Jun Maeda is good at, it's creating very emotionally moving drama.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem with the anime adaptation, though, comes from trying to connect those five independent routes from the visual novel in a coherent way.  KyoAni did the best they could (the best anyone could, really), but it still wasn't quite good enough.  For one thing, it's kind of...drama-overload at times, if you know what I mean.  In the visual novel, they're separate stories, but in the anime, you basically end up getting five stories' worth of drama packed into one.  And it doesn't help that so much of it is so similar -- half the characters suffer from plot-device amnesia, and/or \"Key AIDS.\"  On their own, each dramatic happening is very well done, but all in a row, it feels a bit excessive.  Some of it just isn't even necessary -- there's one particular moment in one of the later episodes where a bit of drama just slams right into you out of nowhere, and I actually laughed out loud at how sudden and unnecessary it was.  The romance aspect suffers from adaptation decay, perhaps even more than the dramatic aspect.  There's a point in the series where Pimp Daddy Yuuichi gets the cutest kiss ever from one girl, and you're all \"awwwwwww :'3,\" but then literally one episode later, he's kissed by and confesses his love to a different girl who had barely even appeared at all in the previous several episodes.  I was re-watching it with my girlfriend, who'd never seen nor read it before, and I believe her exact words were \"whoa, what? Sudden!\"  I had to shrug my shoulders and say, \"just pretend he hasn't been involved with any of the other girls and roll with it.\"  The last problem with the story that arose from adapting all the arcs into one linear story was the final episode.  I won't spoil anything, but it's rather forced and confusing.  People say that about Clannad After Story's ending, but this is significantly harder to swallow, in my opinion.  It doesn't ruin the whole story, but it does cost it yet more points.\\n\\n\r\nNow, onto art!  As I mentioned earlier, the original visual novel came out in 1999, and the art for it was...less than stellar.  Frankly, I don't think it was any worse than the art I've seen from the 2002 anime, but it's still pretty ugly.  The 2006 KyoAni art, though, is MUCH better.  Yeah, okay, their mouths and noses are still almost comically tiny and in the very center of their faces (except for the males), but it definitely looks good if you aren't bothered by that aspect of the style.  The animation isn't always completely fluid, but it's definitely much better than average.  Even if it's 2006 KyoAni, it IS still KyoAni we're talking about here.\\n\\n\r\nSound is definitely a strong point of Kanon's, and of everything Maeda does the sound for.  His compositions set the mood perfectly, 100% of the time.  Well, other than the ED song, maybe, which is sometimes jarringly bright and cheery after a dramatic cliffhanger episode ending, but I won't hold that against it.  The OP is fantastic, and every background track is perfect.  The voice acting is solid, as well, in the original Japanese.  Not a fan of the English dub, due to uguu, auu, etc.  10/10 sound.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter...This is a bit of a tricky category.  On the one hand, the bulk of the cast are little more than one-dimensional moeblobs, but on the other hand...they are SO MOE.  I'm not usually a \"moe\" guy, but geez.  Maeda knows how to write some moe waifus.  Frankly, the romantic aspects of certain routes -- particularly the h-scenes in the original visual novel -- felt a bit awkward to me, because not only do many of the girls look incredibly young, but they also *ACT* incredibly young, often giving off less of a \"girlfriend\" vibe and more of a \"pet puppy dog\" vibe, if you know what I mean.  It's not a huge deal, since ultimately all that matters for the viewer, in this case, is that he or she becomes attached to the characters and wants (Yuuichi) to love and protect them, and I think most viewers would agree that Key was successful there.  Some people might find the characters to be \"obnoxious moeblobs,\" but most will adore them.  My girlfriend thought Ayu was annoying at first, but it didn't take too long for her to fall in love with her :P\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment is the trickiest category, I think.  I mean, typically, if I gave the other categories high scores, I'd give this one a high score, and if I gave the others low scores, I'd give this a low score, you know?  But I can't just average them together and call that my enjoyment score, because for me, it was more than just the sum of its parts.  I criticized the various failings of the story earlier, but when I first read the visual novel years ago, I adored it.  I knew the art was bad, and I knew the plot depended on too many conveniently forgotten memories and \"Key Magic,\" but I didn't care.  It made me laugh, it made me cry, it made me gasp, it made me sigh...It just moved me, emotionally, more strongly than most anything in fiction.  I really enjoyed it.  I didn't enjoy the anime quite as much, but the visual novel might have made me slightly biased compared to a viewer who's never read it.  That doesn't erase the flaws in the story that I described earlier, but they might not bother new viewers as much as they bothered me.\\n\\n\r\nSo to sum it up, Kanon is a VERY emotional, though somewhat flawed story, with solid art for its time, lovable characters, and the perfect musical score.  It's not perfect, and viewers less tolerant of forced drama, moeblobs, and \"Key Magic\" will probably tear it apart, but I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who thinks they might be interested.  Watch it in the snowy winter, with someone or something to hug when things get serious.  I think you'll enjoy it.",

            "content": "Welcome to Kanon, a place where miracles happen, a wintry town where time has stopped, a town where the lost memories of a child will unfold magical stories. A town that needs to move again.\r\nThe amount of symbolism this anime uses might be the reason why I feel this anime is magical, yet, the meaning behind it is realistic, heartwarming and bittersweet.\r\nThe story follows up Yuuichi as he is returning to the wintry town where he used to spent his childhood. He is waiting for Nayuki, his cousin: a purple (or violet?) haired girl. While Yuuichi has his memories screwed he still manages to rememberNayuki's name... kinda, but you can never tell as Yuuichi has the special ability to tease girls like a pro. Moving ahead, we reach Nayuki's home. Where her adorable mother Akiko is waiting for them. And thus Yuuichi will start his life in this cold but warm town as a transfer student.\\n\\n\r\nAs Yuuichi starts familiarizing with the highschool and its surroundings we will come to a loop. A loop where the characters from the upcoming arcs will be introduced. At first I thought that Yuuichi was trying to form a harem for himself, acting like a casanova while he teases girls non-stop, yet, I was merely fooling myself as the first arc strikes and makes me realize that this is much more than just a guy trying to be nice to everyone. In reality, the lost memories of this wintry town are clashing into Yuuichi's mind as he is trying to remember what happened in his childhood. \\n\\n\r\nUnless you live under a rock, you'll probably know that Key's works tend to go around several girls, and also, the need to be utterly tragic. Gladly, this isn't the case with Kanon as it focuses more on relationships and memories. Yet that doesn't mean that this will not be an emotional ride and have some tragic moments on it. Each arc on its own is full on substance and meaningful moments that will be important when the story approaches its end. And then, the flow of time will resume its course.\\n\\n\r\nKyoAni is known for having beautiful visuals on their anime, yet, I'm honestly surprised by the animation quality an anime from 2006 has. The backgrounds are gorgeous and full of meaning, which is lacking on KyoAni's recent works, they might have improved their animation quality, but the substance and meaning behind it's dull and may flood the screen causing an overdose of animation while the meaning gets lost behind, Violet Evergarden is a perfect example of that.\\n\\n\r\nWhile most of the time I always wonder why these anime uses such a very childish design for females, I can say that I really liked their designs as the show introduces these girls while making you get easily attached to them and feeling the need to hug them and pat their heads.\\n\\n\r\nEach arc improves the meaning behind the animation, making each moment heartwarming, and sometimes bittersweet depending on the mood, and for that, I loved it.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the animation was doing a great job on their department, the sound department made a good job portraying it's meaning into a great selection of soundtracks, depending on the mood they will either be funny, calm, sad, heartwarming or bittersweet. The voice acting was good, even for me who totally dislikes the use of very childish voices for girls, yet, the emotions put on the characters did really stand out and worked well.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said before, each character arc is really important and almost every single character is meaningful to the story... with the exception of Kitagawa Jun, who is mostly there as comic relief. (in the end, he ends being a cheerful Savior) Each girl arc has a different focus but the meaning behind each one of them will help squeezing Yuuichi's brain while having glances of his childhood, gradually recovering part of his memories. Some of these arcs might be quite fantastical and surreal, but once you know what it means you'll understand. \\n\\n\r\nKanon's characters are easy to get attached to, and you'll probably end up liking these characters unless you have a thing against Key's works or just don't like them. Either way, the characters are one of the strongest points of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10: I enjoyed Kanon from start to end, its heartwarming and bittersweet moments holds a special place in my heart as it resembles a similar story of one of my relatives. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7,6 (8)/10\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Also he does not remember anything and gradually, in this city, he meets girls \"from the past\", which involves a lot of tragic stories and helps them.\r\nTo be honest, the show is very dramatic, but it banality. Like all the rules of the studio \"Key\" and what they have always been strong, we havea school and a number of different women with different stories that are revealed in the process, and we learn about their dramatic fate. The problem with all of these ideas is that after the story of a girl, the story abruptly switches to another character, and that in the last series was still a major, it moves into the background, If not disappear from the frame at all.\\n\\n\r\nIt begins pretty standard, we show several women, but did not disclose their stories as if they are present, as ordinary characters. At first glance, it may seem that this is a standart \"slice of life\", but the story progresses at an early stage, the dream, as it were, takes us to look beyond story. And yet, in all this story is based on supernatural powers - that is, miracles, and I will not say it's bad, because that was a miracle, we must believe in it.\\n\r\nAs for the characters, they are good, for each character, made a separate character stories associated with them.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, like all works of the studio \"Key\", after about 8 episodes, the viewer becomes interested in the fate of the protagonist and supporting characters, and here is no exception. Kanon attracts attention better and better with each episode and certainly causes a lot of emotions.\\n\\n\r\nAnd most importantly, in my opinion, in this show, it's a music. Each series has a musical name, such as \"Songs without Words\" or \"The Nocturne of Farewell .\" A lot of beautiful piano in the background, which plays almost constantly. Maeda Jun - music genius, skillfully plays on the feelings at some point in the series (Not surprisingly, because he has always been good in the genres: music, drama and school).\\n\\n\r\nThe conclusion to this series is a subtle point, since in spite of a good idea and excellent execution of it, the anime does not avoid the banal situations that are based on standards, which, in turn, are not an experienced viewer can not see. However, Kanon fine plays on the feelings that course and is required by the genre drama, fans of this genre (Drama and Harem),will love it, because it is made at a good level\\n\\n\r\nKanon - it's a drama, performed at the highest level, but only within the limits of the genre, but in any case it is worthy of attention and interest the viewer.",

It has a nice blend of laughter and tears.\r\nAll the girls have their own story to tell and each of their stories have an element of drama in it. Not sure if i can say the same for Kanon (2002) cause i haven't watch it yet.\" - icemachine\r\n\"Wanna ask about the difference between Kanon and Kanon (2006) besides the ratings for the latest one is higher. If anyone has seen both versions, should I just watch the 2006 version because its better or just watch both because they're different stories\" - shoxk\r\n\"Kanon (2006) remakes, embellishes theoriginal story, and it is the easier series to find. So, really you can kind of leave the original behind if you want.\" - zewho\\n\\n\r\n\"I think one is enough, as 2006 is the remake.\\n\r\nAnyway, Kanon (2006) is a masterpiece.\" - shadowzephyr\\n\\n\r\n\"As you can see in my profile, Kanon (2006) is in my Top-5.\\n\r\nFrom the line of Key series (AiR - Kanon - CLANNAD), this anime made me cry the most often. Stories of \"strange girls\" are touching and sad.\\n\r\nI liked Kanon's atmosphere of winter, because I live in cold Siberia and I really like this season :]. Wonderful soundtrack fits excellent.\" - Buran-kun\\n\\n\r\n\"Kanon is very intresting I can't say I heard the original in 1999 but I seen this remake & heard alot of it the story & directs are very time skipin wise since you seen the past of every girl & to see Yuuichi along with the choices he makes good story but the visuals are even more impressive since this is the same pro. company that did Air, CLANNAD, & Haruhi got to say if you in to Air you'll love this\" - Otarocka626\\n\\n\r\n\"Kanon 2006 is a bittersweet anime. It has bits of everything, a great cast of characters and a mysterious plot. I loved every moment of this outstanding anime, and it is one of the very few anime that I gave a 10\\ 10.\" - Midori-tan\\n\\n\r\n\"When I've watched Kanon 2002 for the first time, I fall in love with this production. The story was holding my heart tight from the beggining to the end. Only Yuuichi was looking a little bit girlish but it was a different drawing style.\\n\r\nIn the year 2006 I saw new Kanon and it was like a thunder. When I thaught that I love this anime very much, it smashed my brain and sucked the rest of tears from my eyes making them dry.\\n\r\nFor me Kanon 2006 is the best Kyoto Animation title. Even CLANNAD (which was great) is the second after K2006 in my \"The best anime\" list.\" - Ruhisu\\n\\n\r\n\"Finally an anime I can comment on too !! Kanon is just lovely. It's the kind of anime that gives you WAFF (warm and fuzzy feeling) !!\\n\\n\r\nSomeone mentioned that its a sad anime - I disagree. There is a some sadness, but this is not a tragedy like you may think. Kanon is a heartwarming story that finishes on a nice note. It's a spoiler if I say too much on that, but rest assured, this is a good one.\\n\\n\r\nWhat's your opinion on the dub folks ? I watched the sub first, but I perfer the dub. (for no better reason that it's a dub. It's not too bad and I don't like reading subtitles)\" - chronodekar\\n\\n\r\nWe hope you have found this review useful!",

            "content": "At first glance, this anime may seem a typical harem. However, Kanon is actually an unique drama anime that rivals Clannad (both made by Kyoto Ani) in its own way. \r\nStory: 9\r\nThe plot of this anime is superbly done. This anime revolves around the daily life of Yuuichi and 5 girls. In the ordinary setting, extraordinary story unfolds. Each one of the 5 girls in Kanon has her own sad tale to tell, and all of their tragic past has something to do with the protagonist, Yuuichi. Although Kanon is not really a tear-jerker like Clannad, the revelation of the past for each girl isso powerful that it moves the audience. \\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, supernatural elements are added to the plot in a plausible way. Every arc of the story comes together in a way that makes me astonished. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nKanon has good animation and art. The animation does not leaves out tiny details like brushing off the snow from the coat. The motif of snow contributes to the romantic atmosphere of the story.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nWell, this anime's title and each episode's sub-title is based on names of types of music. The sound tracks used for this anime do not disappoint. Classical piano pieces serve as interlude during emotional scenes. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nAt first, all the girls in Kanon seems odd because they have weird habits that are definitely not normal. At the end though, everything that they do is for a reason that has to do with their past. This aspect is extremely well done, and adds to the awesomeness of Kanon. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, the (female) characters is where Kanon can still improve. The girls all have somewhat similar personalities, only slightly differing in the types of dere they are.\\n\\n\r\nSo why did the characters still achieve a score of 9/10? Well, our MC is one of the funniest characters in existence. It comes as no surprise, then, that he can \"get all the girls\", so to speak.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI had a lot of fun watching Kanon. Even though I didn't really cry even once (come close to though), the story contains a lot of emotions and catharsis. In my opinion, the best thing about this anime is that the revelation at the end of each girl's arc would shock the audience with the sheer epicness of the plot. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nI would recommend Kanon to people who like drama anime. I would recommend people watching it in a language that one is familiar with (ie. if you don't speak Japanese, watch dub).  \\n\\n\r\n*Review is rewritten",

            "content": "There don't seem to be a lot of people who dislike Kanon (2006). This fact actually baffles me because everything about this show was either mediocre or pathetic.\r\nThe characters were,for the most part, very generic. I don't mind generic characters that don't have any qualities that make them stand out, but honestly, Makoto was so freaking annoying, Mai had the personality of a spoon and Ayu is a useless cry baby. Shiori was a nice girl and Nayuki was mildly likeable. Yuichi, though, is interesting to talk about. Even though he came across as very bland, he did make me laugh at time, so Iguess I would say he was a good character.\\n\\n\r\nThe story was below average. It didn't interest me at all. That's probably because this was a very character driven story.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation of Kanon were the one plus of this anime. Everything from the characters to the background looked beautiful and very, very pretty. They were probably the reason I continued to watch. Plus it's KyoAni, so that some it up pretty well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, It didn't live up to the hype for me and was a complete flop. KyoAni anime seem to be pretty hit or miss for me, and if you read the review, I'm sure you can guess which one it was for me",

            "content": "Whenever the topic of \"Saddest Animes Ever\" comes up, usually people would point to animes made by Key. Originally a company that specializes in Visual Novels, would later have their works adapted into anime. One of which is one of their first works that would put them on the map, Kanon. But how well does this hold up after nearly 10 years? Well that's what I'm here to do.\r\nStory: At first glance, this may seem like your typical harem title. But once you get pretty far in, you'll find that it's much more than that. It starts out really slowly like most slice of lifetitles, but once the story arcs that involve one of the five main girls, that's when Kanon's true colors shine. The strength of it is easily it's perfect balance of many of it's elements. It can be really funny as well as heartbreaking. The humor's there to feel lighthearted thus making the more sadder moments hit you hard, but are also to be breathers after the sad episodes, until the next few come around. As for the drama, it's some of the best I've seen in any medium. It'll really bring tears to your eyes and if not, it'll still tug at your heartstrings. Plus, it also knows how to balance realism with the supernatural. Giving us some very out there ideas but also balancing it out with some really relate-able human drama. The story structure really stays true to the melody that it's named after. A song that repeats itself over and over adding more instruments with every repetition. If there are some issues with it is that some story elements and plot twists are only vaguely explained or implied. But despite that, it's still very well executed writing. But the story's only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to Kanon's quality.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Kyoto Animation is very well known for it's moe style and this series show's them at their best. Staying true to the original designs in the original game while also making them their own. The settings and backgrounds are absolutely breathtaking, adding tones of atmosphere to the world Key created. You really feel the cold weather these character live in, as well as all the snow falling.\\n\\n\r\nSound: While most disregard the dub, I still find it very well done. Sure it doesn't really capture the moe-ness of the sub, but give them credit for at least trying. Besides, replicating the original voices is far from an easy task, and what they were able to do was spot on. Each voice really suited the characters they were given.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is one of the best I've heard in an anime. Also adding to it's great quality along with the story and animation. Each track has a beautiful melody that captures the masterful notes you would find in Classical music, as well as making the sadder moments even more heartbreaking once played over them.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Now here's where the show's heart truly shines. Kanon really provides in giving us great and memorable characters. First the main hero, Yuichi Aizawa. At first, he can come off as a big jerk, but it's usually in the style as an older brother to his siblings. But despite this, he's truly a kind hearted guy when the show needs him to be. But he's nothing compared to the 5 main heroines. There's Ayu Tsukmiya, a short hyperactive girl who usually bumps into Yuichi, with \"Uguu\" being her catchphrase. The others include Nayuki Minase, Yuichi's cousin who he starts living with at the beginning of the story, Makoto Sawatari, a hostile one who seems to have a big grudge towards the main guy, Shiori Misaka, a girl who claims to be sick despite being outside in the snow most of the time, and Mai Kawasumi, a mysterious girl who guards the high school battling demons. Each girl has their own unique quirks that would make them seem odd at first, but later on once their story arcs kick in, they become characters that you'll really care for in the end. And on top of that, the minor characters are also really likable. Not all, but there are a select few that really leave an impact on the story. As you can see, the characters will be the main reason, why you'll like this series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: There are many words that I can describe Kanon but the main one I can call it is, beautiful. Kanon is a timeless masterpiece with a memorable story, gorgeous animation and music, and one of the most lovable character casts you'll ever see. If you're looking for something that'll give you a good cry or just looking for a good dramatic piece, this will most likely satisfy you as it did for me. Which is why I consider it my favorite Key series of all time.",

            "content": "Bottom Line: Heartwarming series, incredible remake, and an awesome classic. Its must watch!\r\nKanon (2006) is simply a masterpiece. I can confidently say it is my favorite series of all time. Produced by the infamous Kyoto Animation which also introduced international hits such as The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya and Full Metal Panic series, you wouldn't expect this series less than awesome. Kanon (2006) certainly lives up to that expectation.\r\nStory: The episodes of the anime are basically separated into \"arcs\" for each girl. Each girl has her own background story associated with Yuichi either 7 years ago or early on in [the episodes] the current timeframeof the series. Each girl struggles through her her story whatever it may be with Yuichi and grows closer to him, and ultimately a miracle takes place.\\n\\n\r\nOutstanding plot and synopsis. The flow from arc to arc was a bit rigid, but still excellent nonetheless. Kyoto Animation did a incredible done job on using the several scenarios and each girl's path and combining them together into a single story that can move an audience into tears. Kanon touches on several themes such as Memories, Miracles, the Supernatural, and of course Love. The series does have great light-hearted and comical moments as well often bringing a smile or a chuckle to your face as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe moving plot earns a 10/10 from me.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Excellent work by KyoAni (abv. for Kyoto Animation for the rest of this review). The design was simply beautiful and a great leap up from its first version (Kanon 2002). The backgrounds were incredibly detailed and well-drawn. The character designs were well-done as well, though Yuichi stuck out a bit too much compared to the rest of the large-eyed cast. But its not a very significant factor.\\n\\n\r\nThe overall presentation quality is top-notch and it gets a 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The Soundtrack contains a mix of classical instrumental music (such as Canon, hence the series name: &quot;Kanon&quot;), composed music from the original game,  a few techno songs (Such as the Last Regrets Remix Insert Song and the ED song). The only complaint I had was that the OP song was a bit tiring after a while and seemed much too long.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the OP got on my nerves for a little, it gets a strong score of 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The cast is truly unique. Probably one of the strongest points of Kanon is its lovable cast. Each is character is filled with emotions like real people. Over the course of the show you begin to develop sympathy for the majority of the cast, if not all of the cast. The only problem I having  is choosing my favorite girl from the main cast.\\n\\n\r\nThis awesome array of incredible characters earns a 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall: Really I enjoyed this series from start to finish. The story, the characters, and the flow was moving. I've rewatched the series several times and I still love it as much as the first time. It is an outstanding series, and I recommend it to anyone, even if you are not fond of drama/romance. This is definitely a series you should check out.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said at the beginning, it is my favorite series of all time and still is, it earns a 10/10",

            "content": "Kanon '06 - a remake of a romantic drama based on a popular H visual novel. As a fan of shonen mecha and action series, I really had no business checking Kanon out, but my friends' constant recommendations and KyoAni's good reputation forced me into it. Now that it's over, I can confidently say that Kanon was a ride that was worth taking.\r\nStory -- The overall story can feel a bit slow at times as it gets heavily involved in character development, but every second of airtime is meaningful - nothing is wasted here. The arcs for each individual main character all contain some excellentplot twists, and are well-coordinated - each one is more interesting than the last, and the final arc crescendoes into some of the most breathtaking human drama I've yet witnessed in anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt -- Fantastic on every level. The characters are all drawn very attractively, and the animation captures all the subtle aspects of their personalities. The girls of Kanon can seem unnervingly real at times. In addition, the snow-covered backgrounds are beautiful and add a lot to the romantic theme.\\n\\n\r\nSound -- The music is all very appropriate, enhancing the mood without distracting from the scenes at hand. A piano theme that played during certain key moments was a particular standout, although I wasn't so fond of the OP song. Voice acting was great throughout, with the voices of Yuuichi, Ayu, and Shiori being the standouts.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter -- An anime like this has to rely on its characters - they are the story, so there's no room for faults. Fortunately, Kanon comes through. Every character stands out with a unique style and personality, and the main characters genuinely grow and change throughout their stories - especially Yuuichi, who transforms from a rather plain protagonist into a strong and charismatic hero. I truly cared for the entire cast, although I found Makoto and Kaori difficult to like.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall -- The quality shines through. Although Kanon was a far cry from my beloved Gundam and Bleach, it won me over in the end. I won't forget the vicegrip feeling in my chest that I experienced as I watched those powerful final six episodes, and scenes from throughout the series will be burned into my memory for a long time. I'd recommend anyone who hasn't seen this series to pick it up and stick with it - trust me and KyoAni.",

            "content": "Kanon: Grants Your Wishes\r\nI'm just going to come out and say that Kanon was one of the most emotionally endearing animes I've ever watched. When I went into Kanon, I wasn't expecting much. I saw Clannad + After Story just before watching this and I thought if this was even remotely in the same ballpark as Clannad, I would've been happy. However, this series went above and beyond my expectations. While I wouldn't put this series quite in the came category as Clannad: After Story in regards to how emotionally traumatizing it can be, where it exceeds a series like Clannad: AS is how emotionallytouching it can be throughout the entire series. It had me filled with so many different emotions as the series progressed that by the time it was all said and done, I wasn't sure how to feel. The way it executed the emotional moments was downright fantastic. I cannot praise Kanon enough with just how well executed it was in regards to setting a mood, or atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nI found one of Kanon's biggest strengths was that mood or atmosphere and how it coincided with the story and characters. The way the animation, the music, the artistic design, the voice acting. Everything was flowing in perfect motion. Whenever you can sync all of these things up to create an authentic atmosphere in an anime, it makes it magical to watch. While I planned to watch this series over a long stretch of time, I ended up finishing it in less than two days because each episode's mood wanted me to watch the next episode immediately following. Perhaps even engrossing is an understatement to just how addictive this series was.\\n\\n\r\nThe story was actually one of the strongest I've seen in a Kyoto Animation anime. The story revolves around Yuuichi Aizawa, a high school boy who moves in with his aunt and cousin. He is returning to this town after visiting there seven years prior, but he suffers from a form of amnesia or mental block and has forgotten many of the memories from that time seven years ago. He spends much of his time meeting new friends, even some of which he had met seven years prior but fails to remember. Through these friendships, these bonds, he begins to recollecting the events from seven years ago and ultimately discovers his reason for forgetting. While the story sounds rather stereotypical, it had quite a unique vibe with it's storytelling. The way it executed each arc was remarkable. What made it all the more interesting, was how this series applied supernatural elements while still keeping a realistic feel. That's how much the atmosphere played a role in this series. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters were also quite strong in their own right. Yuuichi was a nice lead character to watch throughout the series because of how much he matured and adapted to the story. I loved all the bonds he formed throughout the series, especially with Ayu. Unfortunately, I hated Ayu...but only because now I catch myself saying \"Uguu\" every now and again. Honestly though, I loved her character and all of the characters for that matter. Nayuki, Akiko, Sayuri, Mai, Shiori, Kaori, even Jun had his hilarious and uplifting moments. The only character I'll personally say I didn't particularly care for was Makoto and that was only because I found her arc and her character to be slightly confusing and somewhat forced. It felt like it dragged on for a little too long as well. Although, I'll also admit that I am somewhat biased considering Makoto's personality was a bit of a turn-off for me, but I'm sure some fans would enjoy her mischievous personality. Overall, I found the characters and how their stories tied into each other worked incredibly well.\\n\\n\r\nI mentioned atmosphere and mood before and I cannot help but applaud Kyoto Ani for how much effort they put into this series. Tatsuya Ishihara's direction was yet again top notch and I'd even argue that perhaps his work in this series was what propelled him to become such a renowned director. Considering the follow-ups he'd have with series like Clannad, Nichijou, and Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai, it's a fair argument to make even though I did love his work in FMP: Fumoffu before this. I could probably go on for pages about the wonderful musical work Jun Maeda and Shinji Orito did for this. They are both masters in the craft of making slow, heartfelt songs that can set the mood for almost anything, especially drama and tragedy. They are a match in music making heaven. The series OP is remarkably strong with it's music and it's animation. Last Regrets by Ayana was such a beautifully depressing, yet uplifting song that set the mood for the series perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nIn regards to weaknesses, this series had very few to speak of. I did find a few here and there that had me wondering a little, but they were very few, very far between, and didn't have an overly major impact on the story. However, I felt one of the bigger weaknesses was the family back story to the Minases and Aikawas. The series doesn't make it very clear as to why Yuuichi went back to this town to attend high school and it didn't do a very good job of explaining why Akiko is a single mother and what sort of occupation she has. I mentioned this earlier, but some of the sub-plots between Yuuichi and some of the side characters are slightly confusing. They weren't all bad, but I found the Makoto arc to be rather daunting at times. I did also feel the story seemed to drag slightly a bit toward the last four or five episodes, but I did find that the last episode and a half made for a rather nice recovery in regards to the pace.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would probably call this the best \"supernatural\" anime I have ever watched. While yes, I know you could probably call something like Clannad supernatural as well, I found that anime's supernatural elements to be extremely light in comparison to this. Kanon does a remarkable job of implementing supernatural elements into a relatively normal story, or how those supernatural elements had an important tie to a somewhat normal reality. If you enjoy a supernatural anime with a realistic feel, like Ano Hana or Tasogare Otome x Amnesia, I think this is the perfect anime for you to watch. Even if you're a Clannad fan and haven't seen this, I would highly recommend it. It's not quite as grounded to reality as something like Clannad, but it's still a remarkable watch. I can certainly give this my highest recommendation, especially for those who love a good romance series.",

It all starts when Yuuchi goes to stay with his cousin, Nayuki, where he meets a bunch of new people who change his life immensely.possibly find any negative comments about this show; as I said, the story is outstanding, the art is very good, the sound is extraordinary, the characters and their development is great, as well as the development in their relationships too. I thoroughly enjoyed the anime and all of the emotion it brings. I won't give away any spoilers, but I did shed many tears throughout. From beginning to end. Also, there was not a character I didn't like, they all had the most amazing connection with Yuuchi. My favourites, especially, were Ayu, Sayuri, Makoto and Mai. Yuuchi had the most amazing connection with these characters, therefore I love this anime very much. Many points made me smile too, as well as cry as I said previously.\\n\r\nOverall, I give this a 9/10 - it was close to a masterpiece. Absolutely remarkable!",

            "content": "In the world of music, a canon is contrapuntal composition that employs a melody with one or more imitations of the melody played after a given duration.  In the anime Kanon, which uses this term as a sort of foundation for what they create, they use Johann Pachelbel's Canon in D a number of times to highlight what the term means, and it\u2019s a musical piece that is ultimately as enjoyable as the anime that draws its name from the term.\r\nStory: I won\u2019t go into the story of Kanon too deeply, but it\u2019s basically about a young man, Yuichi, who moves in to livewith his aunt and cousin, and thus returns to the town he used to visit as a kid.  It\u2019s been seven years since Yuichi was last at the town, and he has no memories of what occurred before.  Throughout the show, Yuichi will meet a number of young women who are important to his past, and for whom he holds the key to their present.  Kanon is based upon an adult visual novel and subsequent all age versions for the PC, and it revolves around individual arcs for the main female characters in the show.  Normally, this type of setup doesn\u2019t work particularly well for a full season of anime, as you\u2019d tend to lose interest when the show jumps from one arc to another.  It\u2019s a testament to how well Kanon was done that when the show makes these transitions, they\u2019re incredibly smooth and it seems more like life is simply going on, as compared to the jarring shift you might see in other shows based on this kind of formula.  Another surprising thing about this show is that Kanon has all of the basic elements to be both a \u201cHarem\u201d and predominantly \u201cMoe\u201d show, but somehow manages to sidestep truly falling into either of these pitfalls.  The characters are cute, vulnerable and all have a desire in some way or form for Yuichi, but at no point do these factors ever take over the show, they are simply characteristics that add to the whole package.  While it does start out a touch slow, Kanon\u2019s storyline quickly speeds up, and is helped along by a great deal of genuinely funny moments that don\u2019t require fan-service and cheap gags to make you laugh.  As each of the arcs slips into the next, the show builds upon itself, and truly pays homage to the idea of the musical canon for which it draws its influence.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The cast is what ultimately makes Kanon such a wonderful show to watch.  The protagonist Yuichi is so vastly different from most male characters in his role; it was incredibly refreshing to see.  Again, he finds himself in a fairly haremish type setting, yet instead of being that lovable loser that are so often pushed into this role, Yuichi has strength about him from the beginning.  He\u2019s kinda of an ass at times, and that\u2019s part of what makes him such a successful character.  He\u2019s not one of those timid type of guys you always see who spend the whole show trying to overcome some intense shyness just so they can speak to the ladies of the show, since from the beginning, Yuichi never really has a problem stating his mind, often rudely.  That\u2019s not to say he\u2019s always the ladies man, as in many situations even he\u2019s taken aback and unsure of himself, but only in the way that\u2019s natural for someone in his situations.  Yuichi is actually incredibly strong and emotional, always wanting to help others, which is a key factor in him helping the women he comes across throughout the series.  He\u2019s got his own emotional baggage, so he\u2019s not a perfect character by far, but his flaws are human, as is his strength and that\u2019s why we can empathize with him so much.  As for the ladies of Kanon, they\u2019re all quite enjoyable in their own right.  I found it rather amazing that I wasn\u2019t annoyed with any of them as the show progressed.  Some of them quite \u201cMoe\u201d by nature, but with the emotional baggage you know these girls are carrying around, that\u2019s not really a bad thing.  Again, the idea of Moe is simply creating a connection by which the viewer feels a need to see the character protected and kept safe, or at least that\u2019s the most common definition that I\u2019ve seen.  With that in mind, this is a show that revolves around you investing your time in watching Yuichi help these ladies as they struggle with their pasts, themselves, or the environment.\\n\\n\r\nPresentation: It\u2019s been said before, but Kyoto Animation really impresses with the visuals of Kanon.  The characters are well done, even if all the girls tend to have the super big eyes that are rather clich\u00e9 amongst anime.  But there\u2019s a reason, as animators have always used bigger eyes on their characters to display a sense of innocence, and that\u2019s something that\u2019s useful in a show like this.  The scenery is amazing to behold, with snowfall and sunsets that are among some of the more beautiful scenery pieces I\u2019ve seen in anime in a very long while.  There\u2019s a specific scene of a water droplet, where the moonlit background is reversed in the water as compared to the scene behind it, it was a visually stunning scene, and only one among many in this show.  The artwork was something that really caught me by surprise, and it was a very, very pleasant surprise.  The music for the show is incredibly fitting, as you won\u2019t find a lot of catchy J-pop songs here.  There\u2019s not much on the soundtrack that you\u2019d really listen to outside of the anime, with the exception perhaps being the opening, but even that\u2019s rather melancholy, but it\u2019s perfect for the mood of the show.  Johann Pachelbel's Canon in D is used in a few scenes, in order to try and continue to bring the viewer more into the show.  These soft, melodic pieces are throughout, often during many of the more emotional scenes, and I can\u2019t say enough about how well the music was used to highlight this particular series.  Music is one of those things that can either distract from a scene, or add to it.  It\u2019s obvious here that the creators were at their best in using the music for Kanon in a way that makes you feel more attached to each scene, as you can hear it, but it\u2019s only one of the many layers of depth to any given scene that makes you care.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I will be honest when I say that the main reason I picked up Kanon was because of various anime forums.  In most forums, there\u2019s always a thread about what anime made people cry the most, and Kanon repeatedly pops up, so my curiosity got the better of me.  I\u2019m truly happy that it did, because I enjoy virtually every aspect of this show.  I\u2019m not the biggest fan of most romantic comedy/harem shows/shoujo but I can enjoy them in their own rights.  With Kanon, I simply loved the show from its earlier comedy antics, to the later parts where you are invested in the characters.  There were also a handful of truly shocking and surprising scenes, and I can say that Kanon was one of the first times I had to pick my chin up off the floor, as I was caught completely by surprise by a scene; it\u2019s been a long time since that happened.  There was a point when I thought the creators were pushing the line a little bit with how much they throw at the viewers, as I thought they were beginning to do things for the sheer value to see how much emotion they could draw out of the audience.  Just when I had considered it going too far, they pulled back at the right moment and the show was ultimately not cheapened.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I really can\u2019t suggest Kanon enough.  It\u2019s officially the first true drama of its kind that I\u2019ve given a rating of a 10, so that speaks volumes about how much I enjoyed this show.  It\u2019s not particularly action oriented, so the hard-core Shonen fans out there probably won\u2019t enjoy it was much, but perhaps even they will find the cute girls here enough to keep their interest.  For anyone else who enjoys a good fantasy/drama/harem comedy with a lot of truly enjoyable characters and a show chocked full of emotion and heart, you definitely can\u2019t go wrong with Kanon.",

            "content": "Before reading any of my reviews, please keep in mind that I am a VERY harsh critic. I do not hand out 10's easily and anything I rate 7 or higher I consider recommendation worthy.\r\nIn my opinion it is necessary to watch BOTH Kanons in order to get a full appreciation of the series. So I will give my review for BOTH at the same time, comparing and contrasting what I believe to be the key advantages and disadvantages of each. I will be rating them separate however. Please keep in mind that one series is primarily drama while the other is primarily comedy. Becauseof this it is very difficult to accurately compare the two. Chances are that if you see people saying they liked one much more than the other, then they probably like that GENRE much more than the other.\\n\\n\r\nStory 5/10\\n\r\nDespite popular opinion, it is actually the original story that has the better storyline. The stories of Nayuki (8/10 &amp; 4/10) and Shiori (9/10 &amp; 2/10) were not done very well at all in the remake. Neither was Makoto's (10/10 &amp; 8/10) as they attempted to make her story ending seem light, happy and even cute which significantly lowered the impact of it. Ayu's story (8/10 &amp; 9/10) was probably done a little bit better in the remake, though I liked the way they handled the story about the hair band in the original more. Mai's story (4/10 &amp; 10/10) was obviously done better in the remake, and is the remakes biggest attraction. The main thing that the original story lacks is humor, which Kyoto Animation makes up for with interest in the remake, giving depth to an otherwise flat main male lead. The original series started slowly due to the lack of humor, unlike the remake. However, the ending was done better in the original because they did a better job with Nayuki as well as added more importance to the accidents, which the remake glossed over a bit. A nice touch in the remake is the incorporation of Pachelbel's Canon in D as a minor theme for the series.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the story in general, it wasn't really that original of an idea. Main male character returns to a town he lived in as a child, but he can't remember anything about his time there because of what appears to be a tramatic experience he had 7 years ago. He ends up spending part of the series trying to regain his lost memories of the time he spent there, and who he spent that time with. It's pretty much all been done before, but I strongly believe that something doesn't necessarily have to be completely original to be good. And Kanon was good, though you need to see both in order to better understand exactly what happened 7 years ago, and to understand why certain characters are the way they are. In other words Mai in 2006 and Nayuki and Shiori in the original, both Ayu and Makoto lack certain bits of important information in each series. Like it's predecessor, AIR, Kanon is at times very emotional. They don't call them &quot;cry games&quot; for nothing. There will be times when you will laugh (especially in 2006), there will also be times when you will cry (especially in 2002), and if you appreciate a good drama then you should find the series to be enjoyable from beginning to end. If I had to rate the overall story, then I'd probably have to rate it 8/10 for the original and 5/10 for the remake. Unfortunately the butchering of Nayuki and Shiori severely hurts my rating for 2006, otherwise it would have been 8/10. The original would have been 9/10 had Mai's story been done better. Also, Kanon had a more obvious haremish feel to it than AIR did, and had less flow between character arcs, though it didn't really affect my rating it may have if the review system worked with decimals.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\nI don't think there can really be any debate here. The art for 2006 was much, much better than the original. The original had a very obvious h-game art style. The characters had very rough designs, though the detail was good. The backgrounds were dull and flat. Overall it seemed very early-90ish, which is a bit hard to handle considering it came out in 2002. Overall I'm being generous when I give it a 4/10. You would expect them to do a better job than they did. However, Kanon 2006 was extremely visually pleasing. The art is very reminiscent of AIR TV which is a very good thing. I love the way the background art was done. The scenery was spectacular, the skies were amazing. The attention to detail was stunning with an excellent choice of colors, color techniques and appropirately placed CG enhancement. As with AIR, the thing I liked most was the eyes. The way they combine CG effects with contemporary art to make the eyes shine like that is beautiful. Kyoto Animation gets full marks from me for art, 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\r\nThe sound is pretty good for both shows, but 2006 definitely has the edge. The BGM were good for both, though I give 2006 the advantage in the theme song department. I loved Ayana's songs. Last regrets was powerful and beautiful and Kaze no Tadori Tsuku Basho was extremely catchy and uplifting. Flower and Floresence just didn't stir the same kind of emotions in me. The voice acting was good in both, the edge again going to 2006 mainly because of the one change they made from 2002 to 2006. The decision to change Yuuichi's seiyuu to Tomokazu Sugita was pure genius. His highly sarcastic tone was a perfect fit for a Key leading role. His interaction with Ayu's and Makoto's characters was pure magic. However, Makoto in episode 9 of the original was much better done than in the remake version. Overall I give the original a 8/10 and 2006 10/10 once again.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10\\n\r\nThe characters follow some of the typical Key stereotypes. Plenty of mo&eacute; provided by Ayu (very similar character to Nagamori in ONE, only difference is Ayu's mo&eacute;ness) and Makoto (sort of a cross between Nanase from ONE and Michiru from AIR, similar hairstyles too, again with added mo&eacute;ness), the quiet and seemingly unpersonable Mai (nearly identical to Akane from ONE in personality and looks almost identical to Nanase from ONE also), the childhood friend (in this case a cousin) Nayuki (sort of like Misaki from ONE personality wise) and the seemingly cheerful girl with a dark secret Shiori (similar to Kano from AIR) and of course the highly sarcastic (in 2006 anyway) main male lead Yuuichi which seems to be a Key trademark. I made no comparisons with CLANNAD, because unlike ONE and AIR it came after Kanon and thus had no influence on the series whatsoever (even though Jun wears a CLANNAD t-shirt in episode 13 of the original series, other things to watch for are ONE's Nanase making several cameos in episode 17 and 18 of 2006 and a Moon poster seen in the theater in 2006). Stereotypes aside though, they were great. Some were done better in the original (Nayuki 9/10 &amp; 2/10 and Shiori 7/10 &amp; 3/10), other were better in 2006 (Mai 7/10 &amp; 10/10, Makoto 8/10 &amp; 9/10, Ayu 8/10 &amp; 9/10, Yuuichi 2/10 &amp; 10/10). Overall I rate both an 8/10. This is due to the fact that the highly humorous nature of Yuuichi, Ayu and Makoto (as well as Akiko at times) in 2006 made it easier to watch. However, the characters in the original (despite having the same seiyuu) seemed more dramtic to me and better portrayed the more serious elements of the series.\\n\\n\r\nEntertainment 8/10\\n\r\nThe entertainment value for both series are high. The original's main source of entertainment is the more dramatic elements of the story, while 2006's main source of entertainment is the more humorous elements of the story. Depending on which you prefer it will drastically affect your opinion on which series is better. Also, a lot of people tend to like 2006 more because of Mai. As I said earlier, 2006's main shortcomings arc-wise were Nayuki and Shiori, who aren't nearly as popular as Mai. It is these 2 factors, combined with the difference in art, more than anything else that I attribute to 2006's much higher rating than the original. Maybe it was because I saw the original first, but I found that the story in the original was much more engrossing than 2006. Possibly the light atmosphere in 2006 made it easier for me to take breaks while watching, but when I watched the original I couldn't put it down. For that reason, combined with the effectiveness of the drama in the original I have to rate it a 9/10 for entertainment. It would have been 10/10 had Mai's story been done better. If you like sappy, slow paced drama, then you will love this series thoroughly. Even though I really enjoyed 2006, I have to rate it a little lower at 8/10 due to the fact that certain elements that I felt were key were missing. They did a marvelous job with Mai, but Shiori's story was confusing and Nayuki was completely glossed over. So i'm docking 2 marks for ruining 2 stories.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\r\nThough I rate them 7/10 for the original &amp; 8/10 for the 2006 version, it would actually be closer if I could use decimals. The original was more like a 7.5/10 for me. The remake was slightly better overall even though I split the category ratings 2 for each with one tied. The bottom line is; if you like drama more, then you'll probably like the original more, but if you like comedy more then you'll probably like the remake more. I tend to appreciate both roughly the same so I ended up liking both versions for completely different reasons and disliking elements of both versions for completely different reasons. In order to get a more complete story it is recommended that you watch both as the original did a poor job with Mai and the remake butchered Nayuki and Shiori. The main reason why most people like the remake more is because Mai is an extremely popular character, the art was much better and there was a lot more humor.",

            "content": "Now, I guess I should mention this is my first review on MAL. \r\nStory 10/10\r\nKanon 2006. Remake of the original Kanon series. A guy named Yuiichi goes back to a town he visited in childhood. Throughout the series, he starts to meet different girls from his past, all unique in their own way. Because Kanon is made by key, there is loads of sad and emotional parts.. If you're sensitive you might just cry your eyes out in this whole seires. Kanon is better than most harem Animes, which is why I prefer it over most harems. The Anime of kanon is very beautiful andunique.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\r\nI don't really know what to say about the art / animation in Kanon. It's decent, I guess.. I liked the kawaii bug eyes. A common thing in the kyoto animation Animes. This art style is pretty, which fits in with the beautiful, emotional plot of Kanon, making the art and the Anime unique. Different to some Animes.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\r\nThere's not much to say about the sound in Kanon, like with the art. I liked the beautiful soundtracks in Kanon that fit in the sadder moments.. I liked how calm, relaxed and beautiful the opening to Kanon was. Which is one of my favourite Anime openings of all time. I found some soundtracks quite catchy. Or is that just me?\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10/10\\n\r\nWhen Yuiichi discovers more of the girls from his past, you get to find out more about their stories. Because Kanon is a slice of life Anime, some stories may be relatable to some people watching. This makes people fall in love with the characters instantly. You could get a growing attachment to these characters throughout the seires. Making you really get into it and feeling their emotions. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nKanon is one of my favourite Animes of all time. Because of the character development and how relatable some parts of Kanon were, I really enjoyed this series. I love the soundtracks too which is why I love Kanon so much.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\r\nI rate Kanon a 10 - outstanding. Because of the beautiful plot, characters, soundtrack and how relatable Kanon is. If you like other works from Kyoto animation then I'm sure you'll enjoy Kanon. I'd recommend Kanon to anyone.. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Summary: A beautiful fairy tale of miracles and a group of high-schoolers waiting for spring.\r\nWho should watch this- People who like fantasy, drama, romance, harem, really nice animation.\r\nWho shouldn&rsquo;t- People who hate Key Animation, want tons of action (there are actually some fight scenes in here, but not a whole lot), are sick of highschool haremy stuff, hate bunnies, like cohesive plots, don&rsquo;t like fantasy.\r\nStory- 7\r\nIt&rsquo;s pretty hard to keep a cohesive plot going when Yuichi needs to have relationships with about five different girls, and KyoAni only partially succeeds.\r\nMy biggest complaint about the show is that the stories seem really disconnected.  Yuichi willhave a relationship with a girl, and then we never see or hear about her again.  Even in arcs with really heartbreakingly sad ends, Yuichi moves on to the next girl as if it&rsquo;s no biggie.   Or when two of the girls are in the hospital, he visits her once and then it&rsquo;s as if she vanishes off the face of the earth until she reappears ten episodes later.  Story arcs are really distinct from each other, which isn&rsquo;t really a good thing.\\n\\n\r\nInstead of tying the whole show together with a cohesive storyline, the various arcs are tied thematically, be echoing themes of dreaming, miracles, love, and hope.  All of the themes are wrapped up at the end, leading to a conclusion that is satisfying thematically, if not plot-wise.  I do think the last episode seemed a bit rushed, as characters that had vanished for about 7 episodes suddenly reappeared, and the episode blitzed through months of time, moving way faster than the entire rest of the show.  It was as if KyoAni was like &ldquo;crap!  Last episode, we need to finish!&rdquo;  I think Kanon would have benefitted a lot from maybe 2 more episodes, or better time allocation in the story.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, because girls only get a limited number of episodes, we miss out on some interesting character development.  A great example of this is Amano.  She could have been a really interesting character, but she only appeared in about 3 episodes, and then totally vanished.  I think the disconnected arcs bear a lot of the blame for why many side characters seem uninteresting, and more like mannequins to advance that arc&rsquo;s plot than actual people (Kuze anyone?).\\n\\n\r\nDespite all of this, the stories within each of the arcs are well told, dramatic, emotional, and often very sad.  It&rsquo;s just that when one of these great stories ends, it feels as if you lurch into a whole new show.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation-10\\n\\n\r\nKyoto Animation lives up to their usual high standard, and the animation looks absolutely gorgeous.  Character design is beautiful and backgrounds are also very detailed.  My only real critique is that some of the clothing is really weird.  Yuichi wears some of the oddest clothing I&rsquo;ve ever seen.  \\n\\n\r\nA vital part of the animation is the town that serves as a backdrop to the whole show.  The town seems to be in a perpetual winter, and its snowy charm really helps the show.  Maybe I just find snow really pretty, but the mystical and slightly surreal snowy wonderland certainly sets a terrific fantasy mood.\\n\\n\r\nLike in other KyoAni works, the animation goes the extra mile in important scenes, such as the Mai/Yuichi dance scene.  CG effects are noticeable, but don&rsquo;t really detract from the enjoyment of the show at all.  Overall, the artwork dramatically adds to the quality of the show, and so merits a ten.\\n\\n\r\nSound- 8\\n\\n\r\nKanon has a pretty good soundtrack.  Interestingly, all of the episode titles are various musical forms&hellip; which often seem to have nothing to do with the episodes.  Um, ok.\\n\\n\r\nIt&rsquo;s also weird that in a show called Kanon because of it&rsquo;s similarities to Pachelbel&rsquo;s Canon, they only play the Canon twice in the whole show.  I expected it to be some sort of recurring theme, like &ldquo;Lillium&rdquo; in Elfen Lied.  Nope.\\n\\n\r\nThat aside, the soundtrack is solid.  All of the girls have their own themes which is nice (Mai&rsquo;s is especially good).  Both the OP and ED sound very good, except that the OP ends on a discordant note, which is very strange.  Other than that, the soundtrack is unobtrusive and enhances the show, but it&rsquo;s hardly memorable.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting is quite good.  Many of the girls have their own &ldquo;catchphrases&rdquo; (for lack of a better term) and there are a ton of nonverbal uguu~s and the like.  All of the girls sound distinctive and emotions are conveyed well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters-8\\n\\n\r\nKanon is somewhat of a harem anime, so there are a bunch of different girls and only really 1 central guy (Yuichi).  Actually, Yuichi appears to be virtually the only guy in this town.  It&rsquo;s as if some plague has wiped out all the males in the area or something.  I mean, you don&rsquo;t even see guys walking around in the street, or in school hallways, or anything.  I believe there are a total of 3 male characters with lines in the whole show. Fortunately, this allows Yuichi to build his harem with no competition whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters themselves- Given that there are so many girls, I&rsquo;m sure each viewer will love some girls and dislike others (personally I loved Mai, disliked Shiori).  Yuichi is basically Kyon version 2, albeit a bit blander, so if you liked Kyon you&rsquo;ll be a fan of Yuichi.  Frankly, all of the girls are more interesting than him anyway.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the girls, they are all quite distinct and have their own unique personalities.  Kanon manages to avoid repetition through character diversity, and the girls tend to be likeable, interesting, and well developed, with some unfortunate exceptions (Sayuri and Nayuki both come to mind).  Most characters besides Yuichi and the main girls are forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- \\n\r\nKanon is far greater than the sum of its parts (to use an incredibly clich&eacute; phrase).  Its component elements &ldquo;work&rdquo; well together.  \\n\\n\r\nFor example, much of the show is fairly surreal.  But KyoAni managed to keep surrealistic events a constant in the show, as opposed to being random and annoying.  By fluctuating between the real world and the mysterious surreal world while keeping them subtly distinct, Kanon handles its fantasy nature extremely well.  And this perpetual mystery surrounding characters and places actually enhances one&rsquo;s enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nI think that is why the OP starts the way it does- with no lyrics and just shots of sunlight, trees, and snow.  Because that&rsquo;s what the show is really about.  It is a fairy tale about a group of students trapped in winter, with the hope that spring is coming, a miracle is coming, and they can begin living again.",

            "content": "Well this is my first anime review that I have ever written and felt that if anything, this had to be the first one I'd write. Kanon 2006 has a special place in my heart that no other anime could hope to fill. Clannad tried but fell just short in comparison to this masterpiece of emotion.\r\nRight I'll do this commenting on each of the bits it told me to rate.\r\nThe story is nothing short of astounding, it may seem a bit cliche or predictable at points but that is half the fun the anime provides. I guarantee if emotional anime is your thing you willfind yourself laughing and crying as the story progresses. Two points in particular spring to mind but you will see these as you watch. So I had to rate the story a perfect 10.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art in this like all of Key's more \"recent\" work is very polished and pretty to look at. If you watched Kanon 2002 first like I did and was sucked in by that plot, then this will make your eyes water as it's so much crisper. The characters and backgrounds look very good and not out of place. It fits the mood of the anime well and adds to the impact of the series very well. So I give it a 10 as well, it really couldnt have been animated any better.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound as in the emotional soundtrack really plays on the feelings of the watcher as the story progresses. Alot of the series soundtrack is a direct lift from the Visual Novel which was released in 1999 so some of it perhaps sounds a little dated. However some pieces in this anime, you will never forget and can provoke a tear or two with too much intense thought. I rate the sound a 9!\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, especially the main female ones are all very well played and unique in their own way. I've seen many anime where a catchphrase said repeatedly by a character is extremely annoying (Naruto and Believe it anyone lol) but this doesn't happen here. The VA's for the characters are pretty much bang on perfect with Yui Horie performing what I rate as her best character in Ayu Tsukimiya. You will find yourself loving and sympathising with each of the characters as the story progresses. So the Characters get a 10.\\n\\n\r\nYou string the above things together and you get a very enjoyable anime, this is the best in it's genre and Key have done a fantastic job creating this masterpiece. It's one of those anime that if they re-adapted it again with the same basic plot, I would still watch it again. I find myself rewatching specific episodes if I want to do something like force myself to cry or something. Hey it works too, so much that I love this anime. Enjoyment gets a 10.\\n\\n\r\nSo there you have it, a godly piece of animation that all lovers of a good story and characters should defintely set aside some time and some Kleenex for. Take my advice and watch this show, you will NOT be disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nMy Rating Overall: 10/10",

            "content": "A slice of life anime done differently? Naturally, that is what Tatsuya Ishihara is known for.\r\nThis anime wins on bringing in hidden points in every arc it throws at you. It will give you a little story and, subliminally, throw a curveball at you; but the ball will fly past your head if you were not paying attention and this anime is all about remembering what you saw before as they do a lot of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu in it. That is, unless you were, again, not paying attention.\r\nEach arc you will see starts off with a pattern: you will see what will be a newmain character, be thrown into their world and pretty much know this character inside out. It seems like each new addition to the cast is a fruitful one and different from the rest.\\n\\n\r\nCAUTION: Next portion of the review contains a possible spoiler. Read at your own potential risk.\\n\\n\r\nThen a sad tale or dilemma will unfold at the ending after their story is finished. For whatever reason, I had no idea why this happened as I do not recall, but it always did. Whether it be a character leaving the town, being injured or another thing, this would ultimately bring them to their demise; to appear in the next section of the anime, anyway.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime stands out a bit for throwing new main characters as you go, intrinsic to most anime, but this one always takes out the newly introduced character before the next arc begins. Rarely in a death scene, only in one I believe, the rest just temporarily phase out the character.\\n\\n\r\nThis makes for interesting story development as the main protagonist is always one-on-one with the next character. Only in rare instances did a new one make a return in the next arc or another one later. It made you ponder where they went off to.\\n\\n\r\nOne, in particular, shrouds herself from serving as the main new character until the ending, though she appears right off the bat and serves as a humorous recurring character; despite being the titular character. She makes use of this though as she has the most meaningful back-story.\\n\\n\r\nOutside the character-in-character-out routine, there are a couple more main characters that eventually stand out in the story as it progresses, but start off as pretty generic and stale at first glance. Then again, what anime doesn't do character development that way?\\n\\n\r\nThis was not exactly the most helpful review as I have not seen this anime in a while, but I remembered just enough to maybe give you some useful information concerning your choice on watching it.\\n\\n\r\nI just recall that each arc had a subliminal meaning that you had to pay attention to from the start to comprehend. That, every character held a significant meaning and that you should never shrug off a certain one; even for a second. And lastly, that the buildup to the ending is one of the better ones you will see.\\n\\n\r\nIf you have seen Clannad, Kanon will feel very welcoming to you as well. Featuring resplendent visuals, very detailed characters among other things, this anime will easily satisfy you. And, as someone whom appreciates the best that anime has to offer, Kanon will provide you with a story that you would not remember too fondly, but would not completely forget, either.",

            "content": "EDIT AS OF 3/21/2011: This review has been updated to include my thoughts on the Japanese dub.\r\n[EVEN LATER EDIT: Some of the things I printed here represent opinions of mine I no longer believe. The text will still remain the same, as a historical reference, but note this: when I first watched Kanon, I listed it as a 9. If you look on my actual list now, it says 10. In truth, it's really 9.5/10 in my book.]\r\nKanon's a pretty popular franchise amongst Japanese Pop culture enthusiasts; it was originally a visual novel for the PC (with hentai scenes, yes, go ahead and snicker ifyou want) and was first adapted into an anime series in 2002 by Toei. It was later remade in 2006 by Kyoto Animation. Most fans seem to disown the 2002 version and go with the 2006 version instead. I came into this show knowing it was a love-it-or-hate-it series; the fans say it's an emotional rollercoaster ride that is very much worth your time. The haters say people only like it because it has moe girls and tons of emotional pandering. Well, short version: I love Kanon. It's not perfect, but I love it.\\n\\n\r\nStory: Yuichi is a high school student who's come back to live in a town he hasn't lived in for 7 years. He can't remember much from when he lived there back then, but whenever someone's in need, he's always does his best to help them out. This is not an action romp; this is a slow and deliberate character study. That could turn away some people. However, it's all very well written and intriguing at the same time. 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nArt: In one word; incredible. This is easily one of the best-looking animated tv series I've ever seen. The characters are beautifully illustrated, the backgrounds are meticulously detailed, the animation is fluid, and just the way everything is rendered is just beautiful. Just watching this show is a feast for the eyes; its artwork is almost as good as an animated movie. 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The background music does it's job; it's decent, but nothing special. The opening and closing songs are nothing to write home about.\\n\\n\r\nThe Japanese dub is . . . well, Yuichi sounds good in Japanese, but most of the girl characters are forcing the moeness too much in Japanese. Imagine teenage girls sounding like five-year olds; hey, you might like that, but it sounds jarring to me. The English dub by ADV on the other hand is solid. Yuichi sounds different, but whether played by Tomokazu Sugita or Chris Patton, he sounds perfect, but the real reason I favor the English dub is the girls actually sound like real teenage girls. Not only that, but Nayuki and Akiko have beautiful English voices . . . but yeah, they suit the characters better. The only dubbed voice I didn't like was Sayuri's; there's something about her delivery that sounds off to me, but in all honestly, even though it is an unpopular opinion, Kanon sounds better in English. 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacterization: They say characterization is the most important element to good storytelling, and it's obvious the makers of Kanon took this to heart; the show has one of the most memorable casts I've ever seen in an anime. Yuichi is affable, funny, and can be mean at times, but he's also very sensitive, and very selfless; more guys should be like him in real life. All the people he meets are memorable in their own way: Nayuki is a sleepyhead, Akiko is a doting mother figure, Ayu is childish, Makoto is a \"tsundere\", Mai is quiet, and so on. The thing is, almost all of the characters are very fleshed out, and transcend their quirks. Sure, most of the teenage girls are perhaps unusually sweet, but most of the characters feel like real dynamic human beings. Everyone is charming in their own way. Oh, also, if you'll permit my saying, Nayuki, Ayu, and Makoto are just adorable! (Consequently, Makoto is now on my list of favorite anime characters.) 10/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Only two things bogged down my enjoyment. One, the first three or so episodes were rather slow. Granted, the series is establishing itself at this point, but the show didn't really hook me until episode 5 or 6, around that range. Also, I feel the ending could've been more effective. It's not a terrible ending by any means, but I feel it could've been more satisfying at the same time. Other than that, I really enjoyed this: it was funny, it was cute, it was heartbreaking, it was heartwarming, it was romantic, and it was all around a feelgood story done right. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSo then, in the end, Kanon was worthwhile. The girls weren't flat moeblobs like, say, a good number of the characters in Lucky Star. There were a lot of soap operatics too, but it didn't feel contrived. Just one word of advice: watch Kanon only if you're not afraid of indulging in your feminine sensitivities. If that's not an issue, then watch it. You won't be disappointed; if anything, I hope it'll be something you remember and cherish as time goes by.\\n",

            "content": "This is one of my favorite animes! Reasons:\r\nStory~ This story is a really touching story. I liked how we begin to learn about the characters' pasts during the story, how their pasts begin to unravel...First it starts off like any kind of slice of life story about two high high school students who are cousins. They wake up, eat breakfast, go to school, go to club activities,go home, eat, sleep..etc.. However after Yuuichi meets a few girls, it all changes...\r\nArt and Sound~ I like the animation company a lot...I think that the characters' looks really match their personnalities. Also when the characters are suppose tolook alike, they look alike. For example, Nayuki and her mother, they look alike a lot. Sayuri and her brother look alike. However, Nayuki and Yuuichi look nothing alike and they're suppose to be cousins...For the sound, there's not much to say, except that I think that the voice actors' voices match the charactes voices.\\n\\n\r\nI hope I'm not giving out any spoilers so far...\\n\\n\r\nCharacters~ I think that the animation really match the characters. It's cool how all the main characters' personnalities are so different and so it makes them all unique. The number of girls is a lot higher than the number of boys. That's it.\\n\r\n The main characters:\\n\r\nAyu: the more childish one (she's actually 17 years old)\\n\r\nMai: the anti-social girl who is isolated by her classmates\\n\r\nNayuki: the kind one\\n\r\nShiori: the polite one\\n\r\nMakoto: the one who likes to pull pranks\\n\r\nYuuichi: the boy who is surrounded by all these girls\\n\\n\r\nThis is only what I think of the characters... Oh, and sorry this review probably sucks, but I really don't know what to say here except that YOU SHOULD TRY THIS ANIME!! That's all. This is also my first review, so...I appologize that it's seriously lacking in some parts xP",

Also, a major tearjerker in many parts; this was the closest ive ever come to crying watching TV :).\r\nThe art was amazing. Quality is typical Kyoto Animation, which is perfect. There are almost no noticeable lapses in quality.\r\nSound is where it was a little weaker. Not bad, but could have been much more dramatic at times.Still, the choice of tunes  for the most part was great.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\r\nMy favorite part of the show. Moe fans will especially rejoice. The characters are extremely likable, you are bound to find at least one character that suits your taste. Each one also develops a very unique personality as the story progresses, and with so many, its a very impressive feat.\\n\\n\r\nI throughly enjoyed it. All the way through. Comedy was mixed in amounts that added a light atmosphere when needed, but never overdid it. Would have given it a 10/10 if it wernt for me not like one of the characters lol.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, an excellent show to watch, even if you are not a moe fan, or romance fan. The quality, everything was excellent and top notch. One of the best animes i've ever seen :)",

            "content": "I usually warn people to not have too high expectations of any anime, like don't expect an anime to change your life, because if you do it will ultimately fall short of such expectations. Since \"Clannad\"(2007) is more popular than \"Kanon\"(2006), know that the anime are about the same, but also quite different, it's likely you've seen \"Clannad\" already. Be sure to remember the more you blow something up the more likely it is to fall short of what you want. That Said... a Kanon is a type of music, stemming from Germany, that employs a single simple rhythm, as the song progresses new instrumentsare added harmoniously playing the same rhythm, creating layers of music. I'm sure you've heard one, you just don't know it.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\r\nA compelling tale of an ordinary young man surrounded by the extraordinary. The story is nothing if not one of experience. It is propelled by Yuuichi's hero complex, that is, his need to help others, and is kept enjoyable by his sarcastic and often times delinquent style of humor. The plot is complex, uncharacteristically so for a love story, and employs twists that are above it's genre. Overall the story is well layered, as the title suggests, and beautifully expressed.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThe visuals in this show are satisfying. It is almost always in snow, and the scenery is wonderfully drawn. The characters are well drawn, the male ones anyways. My only problem with the art is the females are all identical, which is typical for an anime portraying a host of female leads, but it is still sloppy. The eyes are so massive on the females that no room is left on the face to express differing traits. That said, they are rather charming.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nBoth subbed and dubbed voices are good, I suggest dubbed though, since there is no real visual dissimilarities between the females, the voices vary much more in English than in Japanese, which makes it a bit easier for the viewer. Both opening and ending themes are well choreographed and fit the anime well, not my thing though. The opening is a rather sad song which reflects the overall feel of the show. The background music is perfect for this anime, it amplifies the scenes well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nThis show features a Great, well-developed cast. While the families of the characters remain an overall mystery, they are unnecessary. The story employs stand alone characters which adds to the overall sad feeling of the show. There was a single, noticeable, apparent inconsistency at the very end concerning Ayu's family. Though whether it was an inconsistency or a simple misunderstanding on my part eludes me.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI usually don't go for the sappy kind of shows, but \"Kanon\" is a new breed of sappy, enlisting mystery, darkness, and a healthy dose of lighthearted comedy, this show truly is in a league of it's own. The running jokes are not overused, and there's even some nice action!\\n\\n\r\nBut like I sometimes say, ok maybe this is the second time, Go in expecting to change your life and you'll be disappointed, but go in just willing to have fun and open minded, and you'll love it.",

            "content": "**Note: Possible spoilers! Beware!!**\r\nKanon is about Yuuichi Aizawa who has come back to live with his Aunt and cousin after seven years. He always visited there when he was younger however he does not remember anything.\r\nStory: 9\r\nAs usual, the story starts out like a normal harem. Something simple, in this case, Yuuichi was transferred to the school his cousin goes to. It's normal hey? That's completely normal. You start meeting the girls who are possible lovers.\r\nGet this, it ain't a normal harem. The pacing is slow at first, making the series somewhat boring but once you get into it it's just one BAM thing afteranother.Like I said before, because the pacing was slow, the story got incredibly rushed at the end to the point that I was anxious whether the story actually had a proper good ending.\\n\\n\r\nOnto the actual story, this is the most I've cried in any anime. Even more than Clannad and Clannad in my opinion is the absolute best (that includes After Story). I have cried non-stop just watching it. Kanon is such a tear jerker. It had it's funny moments though however the anime faced more to drama and tragedy. I couldn't believe at everything that was going on all at once.\\n\\n\r\nThe overall story was just great. The plot was just incredible. I loved it though the pacing was somewhat bad, earning it a 9.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\\n\r\nI'm not surprised. KyoAni gives you the best of the best. Though KyoAni has improved in art (impossible but they did it!) over the years, the art was truly the best of 06. You can go through all anime released in 06 never finding one with as much detail to it than Kanon.\\n\\n\r\nNow KEY's productions are usually set for a certain season. For example, Air was set for Summer and Clannad for Spring. Kanon is obviously set in Winter. KyoAni has done a damn good job of executing the season. Every single thing was just beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nSince I've bought the DVD of the dub version (luckily it included the Jap version as well and subs), the quality was greatly downgraded. Because of all the whiteness from the snow and the brightening that FUNimation had done, it was incredibly hard to see. The colours were not rich and you couldn't see the outline. However if you look at an original episodes being fansubbed, though maybe pixelated (is that a word??), you can see everything.\\n\\n\r\nIt's unfortunate not to be able to view the series with great quality but I am definitely more than happy just to have watched it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was definitely not Kanon's strongest part for me. I never actually liked the OP and ED. The BGM has never stayed with me. It was just there fitting to the mood. Sound, for me, wasn't outstanding. I've heard better.\\n\\n\r\nSeiyuu however was great. The voices for each character fitted them perfectly. The catchphrases will forever stay in my heart. However seiyuu can speak in such a cute form and say the cutest catchphrases will always be a mystery to me.\\n\\n\r\nSound was good overall. nothing too special. Seiyuu gave it a boost otherwise it would be a seven.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are another strong point of Kanon. Each character had their own story to how they are now. Their reasons are reasonable. I liked most of the characters, Mai and Makoto being my favourite, but a few others were slightly to whiny for my taste. But hey, that's what we do, whine and whinge until we learn.\\n\\n\r\nEverybody changed, most for the better. The main cast for Kanon cannot be forgotten. \\n\\n\r\nThere's Ayu with her 'uguu~'; Nayuki with her heavy sleeping; Shiori with a love for sweets and 10 metre snowmen; Makoto with her 'auu~' and her failed pranks and Mai with her demon slaying sword. \\n\\n\r\nEach character is individual and real. That's what I find important in characters. None of these characters did anything dramatic...well some may have but they had their reasons. You know. But I do feel that some character's weren't explored deep enough. I would've liked for Kanon to have continued on a few more episodes to look into some characters a bit more. You'll know what I mean when you're finished with watching Kanon.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all I loved each and every character though I did find some annoying. I've never actually liked a character who wasn't the main main character. Like how in Sailor Moon, there were a ton of other main characters but Sailor Moon was like just the main character that you liked? Well that's what happened for me anyway. Loving a different character is really nice.\\n\\n\r\nEnojoyment & Overall: 10 & 9\\n\\n\r\nDon't think I'm emo or anything, I'm not, but I really do love anime that make me cry. Kanon was the most that I've cried in though I Clannad is still the best for me. I guess Kanon would come in second or third considering there's After Story. It was funny at the right time and it was just a work of art. Kanon is truly one of the best anime that you can get.\\n\\n\r\nI must warn you though, it is a very sad anime. It's very tragic. So you'll be needing a box of tissues. It will come in handy later on.",

The story is laid out beautifully, you get to see how Yuuichi's relationship with the female characters unfold, and it is wonderful.\r\nArt: 10/10\r\nPerfect.

The character of the series was one of the mostthings that I liked, With half of the girls has their own Prefixes they use intentionally\\unintentionally, UGO~, AUU~, AHAHA~, My favorite character here is Kurata Sayuri, She is so levely that sometimes I like to have a friend like her, The Main Character, Aizawa Yuuichi, Is just like Fujibayashi Kyou from Clannad, unlike most anime boys who are always tend to girls, He do some teasing that make him looks more natural\\funny. They have made a good use of the characters, Like the ending theme where Auy-Chan run on the snow, a KAWAIIIII scene Which you would stay looking at it for a while after finishing an episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is nothing you may be able to guess from watching a few episodes, You would always have some wondering, while they switching you between Comedia\\Drama from time to time, Shortly, I recommend anyone to watch this Anime, Even try to make someone who hates Anime for it's excess of Drama watch it, That would may change his\\her mind.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Kanon is what I like to call \"the prototype of Clannad\". Written by the same author, animated by the same studio, Kanon (2006) and Clannad have the exact same structure, except Clannad is written brillantly and goes beyond school life, whereas Kanon feels more life a bunch of unrelated stories and we don't follow the characters beyond their high-school years.\r\nIs it that bad though? No, I definitely enjoyed watching Kanon (2006).\r\nSTORY\r\nYuuichi comes live with his cousin in that town. He hasn't come here for 7 years, but he doesn't remember why. He meets girls that live here, he already knows them but doesn't remember them.His memories come back whenever the plot needs them to reveal the various stories that this anime tells.\\n\r\nKanon starts as a pure comedy. The first episodes are very light and fun, while introducing all the characters of the story. The anime has very innocent vibes, with all the moe and the light mood. Then, it just kicks you right in the balls with deep and tragic backstories. And it gets you all the time!\\n\r\nSuicide, incurable illness. Those are two of many things this series will do to make you feel depressed. And god does it hurt!\\n\r\nYou got it, Kanon is quite emotional. Despite the cute, innocent, naive mood, Kanon has heavy subjects that are bound to make you cry.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, it does have one major flaw: while each individual story is very nice, there's no actual overall story. The anime introduces each story, one at a time, and in the end, I just felt like \"ok, this is good and all, but what was the purpose of all this?\".\\n\r\nKanon doesn't tell anything. In fact, you could almost watch each story individually. That's how unrelated they are. Kanon doesn't feel like one big world, but more like several little stories. Good stories nonetheless. But the lack of actual story makes this show dispensable.\\n\\n\r\nBUT, despite this, Kanon does have a powerful theme : regrets.\\n\r\nAnd this is what ties everything altogether: Kanon is about people living with their regrets. It's a very strong theme, and could have been stronger if the story was a bit more consistent.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART\\n\r\nFor a 2006 anime, this is definitely good. That's to be expected from KyoAni.\\n\r\nI do have one problem though : the eyes feel blurry.\\n\r\nOf course, it's also a style of eyes that won't please everyone. But I personally don't mind this style. It's really that they are blurry, like they were on a lower resolution than the rest.\\n\r\nIt definitely brings the visuals down. Aside from that: great light effects, beautiful environments, nice animation...\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\r\nNice OST, nice seiyuus. I don't really like that each female character has \"moe manneurisms\" (like Ayu saying \"Uguu\", or Makoto saying \"Auuu\" all the time), but given that the characters are meant to be stupid, that may actually fit them.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER\\n\r\nEach main female character has a very nice and deep story to discover. But Yuuichi, the MC, is empty. He does not have any story on his own. He is related to all the girls, but in the end, their stories aren't HIS story. As a result, Yuuichi himself is just transparent.\\n\r\nThat said, he is very fun. In fact, his reactions (or also his lack of reaction) adds a lot to the comedy side of the story.\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\r\nI did not regret watching Kanon. I was surprised by how good it looks and by the depth of the stories it tells. I also loved the comedy.\\n\r\nBut the lack of actual story makes it boring after a while. It really ruins the whole anime for me. That, and the end, which just doesn't make sense.\\n\r\nIt's still a nice story. I would recommend it... if there wasn't Clannad.\\n\r\nBecause frankly, Kanon is really like a prototype of Clannad: Clannad has the same structure and same mood, but is better written, has better visuals, has a deeper MC, and has an actual story.\\n\r\nBut of course, better watch both those series!",

There he meets a lot of girls that he had known and left them there. All these girls have tragic stories that involve his actions seven years ago. In my opinion, he changes a lot of destinies when lefting this town.\r\nSTORY: 9\r\nThis series has a great story. As the Anime continues you'll find out new moments of Yuuichi's life seven years ago. You're introduced to different girls and after that you find out their stories one after another asthe plot is presented. Each of these girls have tragic stories that changed their lifes, involving Yuuichi's participation. I liked that these series included some funny moments, some tragic moments and some love moments; these moments were very good combined , which formed a brilliant ansamble.\\n\\n\r\nART: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe animations in the series is awesome. All characters are well-detailed (if you it in 720p or 1080p you'll notice this). The environment looks very good, also the lighting in scenes that involve sky is also well-made. And also, environment colours suit very good the situations that pass at that moment.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 10\\n\\n\r\nThe music in the Anime is great. It worths downloading the Soundtrack. If you enjoy the piano themes suiting moments, it means it's for you. The OP & ED themes are interesting, but I liked them only after the 2th episode and at the end they began to piss me off. But, I repeat one more time, Music in this series is Magnificent! \\n\r\nThe characters' voices suit them very well. Seiyuu had done a great job. I recommend you to watch this series with Japanese audio, so you can listen to characters' real voices. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 10\\n\\n\r\nThe main character Yuuichi is a very good example of a gentleman. He treats girls very good. Helps them when they need it. The worse part of him is when he was a child. He made some mistakes. I'm sure you'll notice them. The girls' have their own character/personality that suit them in their own way. Though you'll not some of their behaves, you'll get a good impression of the most of them.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 10\\n\\n\r\nI'm sure you'll enjoy these series, if you like Key's work an especially Jun Maeda's. If you enjoyed such series as AIR and Clannad, You'll enjoy and this. The ending of this series leaves you a good impression and feeling. It doesn't leave you with a depressed mood. Everything is revealed and all questions are answered.\\n\r\nWhat can I say now? Summing all this I can tell you that this is a must-watch/have MASTERPIECE series. If you watched series of this nature, or not, I'm sure you'll like it!",

            "content": "Moe has been a big trend in anime for the past decade. It has become one of the most recognizable, and most common staples of the media. Anime fans just can't seem to get enough of cute girls doing cute things, and the trend has spawned successful series such as Clannad and Air; as well as other series like The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya and Lucky Star, which lovingly poke fun at the trend. Kanon, along with Clannad and Air, is one of the most successful of its kind, and just about epitomizes most of what the moe trend has to offer. This of coursemakes the show an ideal specimen to examine all the ups and downs this trend brings with it.\\n\\n\r\nAfter seven years, Yuichi Aizawa is returning to the city where his cousin, Nayuki Minase, lives. Furthermore, he is actually moving in with Nayuki and her mom, while he attends high school; attending the same school and ending up in the same class as Nayuki. Although he visited Nayuki often and wandered around the city when he was young, he can hardly remember those times. However, Yuichi's memories begin to return in bits and pieces after he meets Ayu Tsukimiya, whom apparently is one of his childhood friends. He later meets an odd sick girl who hangs around his school named Shiori; a couple of strange senior girls, Mai and Sayuri; and a girl with no memory of her past or knowledge of who she is (though later she remembers her name is Makoto Sawatari). As Yuichi learns more about these girls and helps them through their troubles, the memories of his forgotten childhood continue to return.\\n\\n\r\nNow, what we have here is an interesting set-up. The fact that Yuichi has no memory of his time in the city, and that multiple girls are somehow tied to his past, whether they know it or not, grabs the viewers' attention instantly. Throw in some mysticism, and the show has effectively hooked the audience if for no other reason than they want to know what the heck is going on. Luckily, Kanon also has a healthy helping of comedy and drama (melodrama actually... calling it drama is an understatement) that will make the viewer want to stick around. This is actually very important, because the many of the revelations as to why these things are happening are quite silly, or even ridiculous when you apply logic to them. The comedy and drama go a long way to make Kanon enjoyable, and are actually the series biggest draws. The show can have you laughing at one moment, then tug on your heartstrings in the next. If the deal with Yuichi's memory and the mystical elements of the story seem gimmicky... well, that is because they are.\\n\\n\r\nMajority of the cast in this show are female, with only the exception of Yuichi; the resident comedy relief character, Kitagawa; and a few other very, very minor roles being male. This is one of the major staples of the moe trend. So is the odd personality quirks the girls posses, such as Ayu acting like a child despite being 17, Nayuki's drowsiness, Sayuri referring to herself in third person, etc. These traits are, of course, the show catering to anime fans who want to ogle at cute girls doing cute things. While there is nothing per say wrong with this, the uninitiated will be left wondering why the girls are acting this way. For his part, Yuichi makes a fine lead, countering otherwise unchecked cuteness of the girls with quick witted snark, adding more flavor to the show (especially its dialogue). Kitigawa is also a likable goof-ball but, like most of the cast here, is not all that uncommon in the sea of moe-centered anime characters.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is produced by Kyoto Animation and those who are familiar with that studio's work will be getting exacly what they expect, some high-quality, gorgeous visuals. The animation is more fluid than any slice-of-life anime that came out before KyoAni appeared on the scene, the character designs are always on model and will please moe-fans, and the backgrounds are absolutely beautiful, probably being the best thing in the package. That said, the direction here is woefully unambitious. Really, the only thing that sets it apart from other slice-of-life anime is its high quality, and if you take other KyoAni projects, Kanon doesn't really stand out (well, there is one point where two characters are fighting invisible demons, which is cool... but that is only a small part of the show). It still is a sight for sore eyes, however. Similar can be said about the music in Kanon. It is all well composed, sounds wonderful, and is amply used to support the emotion of every scene. Unfortunately, it neither sounds or is used differently than most other anime. Kanon has strong technical value on all accounts, but a general lack of creativity hold it back from reaching true technical grandeur.\\n\\n\r\nKanon is a fine example of the moe trend done right. There is a lot of comedy, drama, and cuteness to be enjoyed here. Of course, therein lies the problem. Kanon is a great moe-fest, but not a great show. The plot is, to be honest, a mess. The characters, while likable in there own right, are easily lost amongst the rest of the moe crowd. All this considered, Kanon is still worth its time. This show might not leave the longest lasing  impression, but it is sweet while it lasts.",

            "content": "\"It\u2019s called a miracle because there is a chance of it coming true.\"\r\nKanon (2006)... let me say that this is not only one of the greatest animes Key has ever made, this is one of my personal favorites. I have rewatched this series time after time, and I've even got my friends to watch it. Like all of Key's work, this entire show will have you crying in multiple scenes because of how emotional it can get. The story was beautiful, the characters were all amazing, all of that makes for an amazing anime.\r\nWhen I bought this anime, I hadn't heard anything about it. AllI knew was that it was made by Key, and since I had loved Clannad so much, that was a good enough reason to buy it. That was probably one of the best decisions I've ever made. I'll tell you upfront that no matter what kind of genre you prefer, most of you will end up liking this a lot.\\n\\n\r\nStory-wise, incredible. There were 5 stories in the entire series, all with those emotional scenes I was talking about. Almost every story involved something about Yuichi's past when he was staying with his Cousin and Aunt as a kid 7 years ago, which was a good plot to add by the way. All of it eventually leads up to the final story in the series, which was by far the saddest in the show. Each story had me on the edge of my seat, wanting to know what would happen next, so don't worry about being bored.\\n\\n\r\nI liked all the characters. Makoto and Ayu, personal favorites in the show. They're cute, well designed, just how you'd expect from Key. Top grade. But the best artwork in the show was the seasons. Most of the series takes place during the winter, so expect plenty of snow, in fact, the snow in this show was the reason winter became my favorite season. The snow was beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nI liked all of the voice actors and actresses. Brittney Karbowski: Amazing Actress. Ayu Tsukimiya: Best Character in Kanon (2006). Put them together, you get one of the greatest combinations in anime history. Brittney voices Ayu so perfectly and realistically, it's hard not to love her. Along with the voices of Tiffany Terrell, Chris Patton, Jessica Boone, and others, this show has an amazing cast.\\n\\n\r\nI'll say it right here right now, this was the first anime I've watched where I didn't hate any of the characters at all. I loved them all. Unique, funny, lovable, can't hate any of them. It's a rule in my book. \"Rule 47 Section 3: Thout shall not hate any characters from Kanon (2006). Crime punishable by me pointing drastically at you.\".\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, I'll admit the first episode started a bit slow, but after that it picked up right away. After Ayu entered the show, things never going, same thing with Makoto. Can't be bored. And believe it or not, that's also a rule in my book. \"Rule 47 Section 4: Thout shall not be bored while watching Kanon (2006). Crime punishable by me pointing drastically at you.\"\\n\\n\r\nOverall, like I said before and will remain the same, one of my favorite animes of all time. You can't be a true Key fan unless you've watched Clannad, Kanon, Air, and Angel Beats.\\n\\n\r\nI hope this review helped. Uguu...",

            "content": "Kanon is the first key visual novel ever made as well as the first key anime ever made. However when the original Kanon anime was made, it left a bad taste to fans of the original visual novel. It was only 12 episodes, and the animation and character design left much to be desired. After the anime adaptation  of keys other visual novel Air, it was proven that visual novel anime can be made right, and due to fan demand Kanon was remade and here we are.\r\nStory: Kanons story, like all key story, relies on emotional characters and situations rather than logical ones. Thatdoes not mean that this is a \u201cdumb show\u201d but if you are interested in an anime that makes you think, then I would not recommend this one.\\n\\n\r\nYuichi Aizawa, a high school student has moved to the town he has not visited in the last seven years. In this town, seven years before, something very important has happened to Yuichi, but he can't seem to remember it. So did something really happen? Or is it all just a dream?\\n\\n\r\nYuichi moves in with his aunt Akiko, and his cousin Nayuki, who has a thing for him. While living in in this town Yuichi meets several girls some of which may have a connection to his mysterious past. The girls are Ayu, who seems to live in the city and likes to say \u201cugu!\u201d. Makoto, who has quite a foxy attitude and can be violent, Shori, an underclassman who skips school due to her life threating illness but still sneaks to the schools courtyard to see her sister. And Mai an upperclassman who fights ghosts in the schools hallway at night.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The music in Kanon id say is the second best key sound track, slightly below clannad. The music fits with the emotion going on with the show, and makes sadder moments all the more powerful. The opening and ending songs are great, but sometimes when an episode ends sadly, the ending music does not fit the situation. Overall, the music does not disappoint.\\n\\n\r\nArt. The artwork has vastly improved over the original kanon anime. Eyes have proper proportion on the characters face, leaving the characters face look more expressive and less creepy. I've said this before for crest of the stars but kanon has a soft dreamy feeling, with the snow, coloring and at times relaxing music. The art works goes well with the characters and location, so nothing feels out of place.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Kanon is one of the best anime key has ever made. It has extremely engaging storyline and remember-able characters you will miss when the show is over. The only thing the original anime has over this one is the mini after story Ova which explains what the characters did when the storyline is over. Its not required but would be nice to have. So if you have enjoyed keys other work such as clannad or want a good harem, check out kanon, It is one of the best in the genre. \\n",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MASSIVE SPOILERS FOR THE ENTIRE ANIME.\r\nKanon (2006)\r\n It\u2019s really hard for me to put words down to this show. It\u2019s more difficult than it should be, but that\u2019s an issue of mine.\r\n I guess we can start with the aesthetics of Konan. I love the art-style. I love how the eyes look like they\u2019re painted on the faces, I love the way the art is rendered/drawn, I love the minor details that are shown. The girls are all cute, the setting is pretty. The colors used are in a more realistic sense, nothing ever seemed to be vibrant in anime only ways,which I feel suits Kanon really well. \\n\\n\r\n We can start with the opening used for Kanon. It\u2019s one of the best songs I\u2019ve ever heard in my life. It\u2019s the perfect song for Kanon. The animation that goes along with the song perfectly captures Kanon and its story. If the only thing I liked about Kanon was its opening, I\u2019d honestly be okay, it\u2019s that good.\\n\\n\r\n So\u2026.a lot happens in Kanon and I\u2019ll try to write down the parts that stood out most to me. Since the opening used sounds very sad I was expecting the anime to start off on a low key moment, building tension over time, but it starts out quite happily. We meet Yuuichi and Nayuki. Yuuichi is a funny character, who can be quite sarcastic and is good at being blunt with his words, an unexpected quality from a main character. The most important \u201cthing\u201d to arise from the episode is how Yuuichi can\u2019t remember any events from his last visit in the city. Shortly after, we\u2019re introduced to Ayu, an old friend of Yuuichi\u2019s. She\u2019s without a doubt a favorite of mine. Her \u201c uguu~\u201d is just so cute and she\u2019s an adorable character. Right after Ayu, we\u2019re introduced to Makoto and it\u2019s around here that Kanon shows its true colors.\\n\\n\r\n From Episode 5-10 the story turns to Makoto and her arc. It\u2019s during these 6 episodes that the story goes from a happy and blissful-like tone to one that\u2019s somber and sad. Having met Mai, the demon hunter, we learn more and more about Makoto, through her interactions and how both Yuuichi and Makoto open up to each other. From Mai we meet Amano who helps Yuuichi out during Makoto\u2019s final moments. Learning about how Makoto is a Youko and what a path like that entails is heart breaking. Throughout the arc we see Makoto slowly regress mentally and physically until the only thing Makoto can say is \u201cAuu~\u201d. This absolutely hurt to watch, I cried so much. Writing this up is bringing those emotions back up like a torrent of raging water. When Yuuichi decides to marry Makoto and they spend the last day together on-top of Monomi Hill is beautiful; as he plays with Makoto to the very last second, Makoto gets tired and sleepy, then she disappears in his arms leaving behind only her bells, this absolutely hurt me. I wouldn\u2019t be able to handle such a situation. Just watching broke me down. The story about Youko is incredibly sad. To be put through all those emotions and then to lose it all so quickly, insane.\\n\\n\r\n Episodes 11-15 then focus on Mai (Shiori too) and her demons, but it\u2019s so much more than that. The relationship between Mai and Sayuri is envious. They share a beautiful love between friends and learning more about Mai and Yuuichi is devastating. Mai\u2019s backstory is unfortunately sad, but at least it had a good outcome. Learning that Mai actually had supernatural powers to repair/fix issues is amazing. It\u2019s just so unfortunate that people had to make fun of her and ostracized her forcing her to be alone. Seeing how Mai reacted to Sayuri get hurt was both intimidating and heartbreaking. The fierce determination to destroy the demons during the ball was scary, but at the same time, entirely understandable. The realization that the demons are actually Mai\u2019s supernatural power was an unexpected twist. The fact that Mai believed so hard that demons were actually going to appear was really out there. It\u2019s as if the demons were an excuse to keep Yuuichi from leaving the city back when he visited the first time. Seeing Mai understand this revelation and attempt to take her own life was daunting. Everything about Mai and Sayuri played perfectly.\\n\\n\r\n Shiori\u2019s plot takes place in many of the later episodes, with 16-18 having the most story to them. Shiori and her health issues are an incredibly sad topic to switch to, but the way Yuuichi handles it all is amazing. I think it\u2019s the perfect way to handle a situation like that. Instead of always thinking about it and having it loom over everyone\u2019s head, don\u2019t think about it and try to have the best time of your life. Learning about Kaori either from Shiori or Kaori herself was some messed up stuff. I know that I would never be able to ignore someone like that in my life and the way Kaori does it is scary cold. Yuuichi does a fantastic job of making Shiori\u2019s last week as best as it can be, but with Kanon, I already had a feeling things wouldn\u2019t be so happy and fun for long. I\u2019m glad that in the end, Kaori opened her heart up to Shiori and tries to mend the problems she inadvertently caused. It\u2019s unfortunate that Shiori had to change the mood at the end of her birthday. Spending time alone with Yuuichi and talking about how she wishes she never became close friends with anyone hurt so much to hear. The way she disappears absolutely ruined me, as it did for Yuuichi.\\n\\n\r\n Ayu and Nayuki\u2019s plot sort of intertwine. Though Ayu is a focus for the entire show, Nayuki is left off to the side for most of Kanon. I always knew that Ayu\u2019s plot would be really sad and seeing how she was a part of so many episodes, she\u2019s probably the most important character to the show and Yuuichi. Although Nayuki and Yuuichi are cousins, I always felt sad for her; because it\u2019s pretty clear she had/has feelings for Yuuichi. Unfortunately, Ayu was the girl that Yuuichi fell for. The way Shiori\u2019s plot ends leaves Yuuichi feeling real down, thinking that she has passed away. During the 19th episode we see just how much Yuuichi and Ayu care for each other. Speaking with one another, Ayu brings up her mother and how she left her; while speaking about the moment she asks Yuuichi if he\u2019s ever felt something similar to that (A sense of total abandonment). The rush of memories for Makoto, Mai and Shiori hit Yuuichi hard, as if he hasn\u2019t taken the time to reflect on everything that\u2019s happened, this all forces Yuuichi to almost cry in front of Ayu. During this bittersweet moment, the two share a kiss and it feels magical to witness this turn of events. Ayu\u2019s plot though, is complicated and it\u2019s not easy for Yuuichi to sift out what she\u2019s missing or who she really is. The way we get flashbacks to Ayu really start to open up her story. I personally knew that Ayu was missing the doll, I had a feeling she fell of the tree, that moment was obvious, but even though it\u2019s obvious, I could never prepare myself to watch it happen. \\n\\n\r\n The last 3 episodes are when Kanon gets into maximum drama mode. Nayuki\u2019s mother Akiko being hit by a car was straight up torture. Seeing how Nayuki breaks apart as a person and forcing blame on herself really hurt to watch. When Yuuichi realizes who Ayu is and what happened so long ago was nigh on depressing. The revelations that occurred during the end were intense.\\n\\n\r\n The 24th episode was absolutely adoring. After being slayed to watch essentially 20 episodes of sad and heartfelt moments, one good episode was necessary. When we learn that Ayu didn\u2019t die, but was in a coma for seven years, made my heart skip a beat or two. Seeing how everyone was getting better, Mai and Sayuri, Kaori and Shiori (This was truly touching, I honestly thought that Shiori died, seeing her alive and well made me so damn happy), Akiko and Nayuki and lastly Ayu and Yuuichi. I couldn\u2019t have wished for a better ending. The last frame with the tree bud on top of the cut down tree and fox walking in the background, everything really did end on a good note. \\n\\n\r\n In the end, I think there are a lot of ways to describe Kanon, but I think the Opening and Ending act as a great allegory for the entire show. \\n\\n\r\n Throughout the entire show, I had an emotion/feeling occur within me that I\u2019ve never felt before. I don\u2019t know the word to describe it, but I can summarize how it felt. \u201cAs if my chest is being squeezed against, my heart being punctured over and over and over again\u201d. I cried so much during Kanon; I\u2019m really glad to have watched it.",

            "content": "Toei first tried to take this Key eroge visual novel into an anime adaptation, but created something in 13 episodes complete with plot holes and cutting the original story. Then, only four years later Kyoto Animation stepped in for the series save together with director Tatsuya Ishihara (Air). This Key show was the company\u2019s debut visual novel in 1999 followed up with Air in 2000. Not to be confused with the company\u2019s co-founder Jun Maeda, Kanon was created by Naoki Hisaya which could be why this show is the most original story from Key.\r\nKanon follows a young 17 year-old man by the name of AizawaYuuichi. Seven years ago he spent a small amount of time with his cousin in a small northern town. However, he does not remember anything from his time there due to a certain event from his past. The key to his lost memories are shown in the form of arcs in which Yuuichi encounters and spends time with the girls of his past: Nayuki (cousin), Mai (mysterious), Shiori (ill stricken), Makoto (high energy), and Ayu (sweet). Ayu is the character that spends the most time in the show with Yuuichi and truly holds the main key to his past.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is \u2018key\u2019 to the show are the emotional impacts each arc gives the audience. For some, this could be the emotional roller coaster fans are looking for. The story has a solid mixture of harem, slice of life, romance, and even supernatural and not done in a way that overwhelm the overall plot. Kyoto Animation\u2019s choice to increase the number of episodes to 24 allowed for a slower approach to the plot, character development, and staying true to the source material.\\n\\n\r\nEach character in the show gets their right amount of time and analysis for the over-arching plot. However, the characters consistently act out of their element just for the sake of advancing the story and creating more drama. The impact is there but executed in a non-believable manner.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation in the show does not quite compare to the studios previous works in Haruhi Suzumiya but comes close. However, with the 2006 update, it is clear the show is much more smooth and fluid than done previously. Even the music matches up better and sets a much more mellow tone for the atmosphere in the show. The change from drama to comedy to romance enhances scenes well.\\n\\n\r\nEach arc, as tight as the story is, does seem a bit out of place and can drag. Instances are seemingly over dramatized for the sake of drama rather than good writing. Previous arcs and even the climatic ending unfortunately all suffer from the \u201ceverything happens to work out\u201d finish. Meaning, loose ends happen to fit nicely and everything is magically resolved. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Kanon (2006 version) as much better as it is than the previous attempt, is still just a fine show and to date easily the best show from Key. The original story and easy-to-root for trope characters make for a compelling watch. It has the right amount of drama and shows how when a studio puts the care into a show, even the most average could be better.\\n",

            "content": "The KeyAni adaptations, and harem visual novel adaptations in general, are beset by a tendency to relegate some, if not every, female character to a setup for an emotional punchline (figuratively and literally, as the narrative climaxes tend to involve the central character getting maimed, physically and/or emotionally). Once sympathy is maximally bled from the girl, she is disposed of either by narrative convenience or hasty preoccupancy with the next girl. This sadistic pattern emerges naturally from the harem visual novel, but what works in a video game doesn't translate quite well onto the TV screen. Television lacks the agency and immediacy found in games,so time devoted to developing a female character and her relationship to the MC becomes wasted once she is tossed for the next, never to have an inkling of relevance outside of \"best girl\" polls again. \\n\\n\r\nWhat are some ways to remedy this narrative disease endemic to harem VN adaptations? Toei's solution was the virtue of economic storytelling. For the movie adaptations of Air and Clannad, Makoto Nakamura stripped the source materials of their character and route multiplicities, resulting in typical monogamous romance tales. Consequently, they have fairly coherent narratives, yet they feel rushed and lack the wholeness of a fully realized story. How can an adaptation avoid the aforementioned flaws of a harem VN without abandoning the harem?\\n\\n\r\nThere's a cafe scene in Kanon's fourteenth episode in which one of the characters asks the MC, Yuuichi, if he recognizes the song playing over the speakers. The piece, Pachelbel's Canon, is not only the show's namesake but its narrative foundation. Like a canon, in which a melody, the leader or dux, is introduced and played again later in some form(s) of contrapuntal imitation, the main approach employed in Kanon's structure is the reiteration of narrative on multiple diegetic levels. The most pronounced manifestation of the canon is written into the broad history of Yuuichi's time spent in the snow-covered city. Over the course of the show, the current timeline is slowly revealed to be a repetition of past events from Yuuichi's last visit, setting the musical duration at seven years. Kanon chooses to present the past in an impressively seamless manner. Instead of inserting flashbacks at narratively convenient moments via battle shounen-style, Yuuichi rediscovers his history through dreams, which doubly serve as pacing buffers between the cycles of his daily routine. By bookending each day with a dream of the past, the events from seven years prior are incorporated into the current, and the discrete timelines begin to harmonize until the past collapses into the present.\\n\\n\r\nThe first couple episodes set Kanon's rhythm; each girl is introduced into the daily routine, coming in gradually as reiterations of a similar sob story from Yuuichi's forgotten past. The schedule is thus: wake up and eat breakfast with Nayuki and Ayu; walk to school with Nayuki; eat lunch with Sayuri and Mai; skip a bit of class to meet up with Shiori outside the school; eat taiyaki after school with Ayu; foil Makoto's nighttime pranks. Yuuichi learns something new about one of the girls with each iteration: one day he realizes Shiori may have a sister in his grade; the next day, he finds out Mai's birthday is upcoming and buys an impromptu birthday gift for her. It's never really predictable which of the arcs will be explored next; the show keeps you guessing by weaving important details about different characters together. This way, each arc is developed alongside another, and the show constructs a braided narrative rather than a segmented pastiche of the MC's romantic life. Motifs shared between the character arcs include hospitalized family members, novelties gifted by the MC (especially hair bands), forlorn promises, gastronomic affinities influenced by the MC, and wishes/dreams in media res. The arcs resemble each other, and though this type of bad writing is pathological in these adaptations, it actually works, whether intended or by happenstance, in favour of the show, establishing a main theme like a canon's dux. As in a canon, where the intricacies of the leader unfurl through repetition and interplay between its followers, Kanon's characters are developed steadily at intervals in the slice of life narrative.\\n\\n\r\nThe slice of life segments are employed with expertise here, ingratiating the viewers with each girl at a steady, repetitive pace. Repetition is key, even in the comedy found in the short manzai routines or the character specific gags (for example, Akiko's special jam became more amusing with each introduction to a new character's palette). As the days repeat, the daily narrative begins to denature and break down as the voices play out to their natural conclusion. The different arcs are explored and conclude, and respective characters drop out (Makoto disappears; Mai and Sayuri are hospitalized; Shiori is hospitalized) but not completely since they are permutations of the leading melody, and their presence can still be discerned in the remainder of the show (e.g. the snow bunny reminds Yuuichi of Mai creating a snow bunny zoo for her mother instead of Nayuki's confession, the spectral Makoto watches over Yuuichi during the climax of Nayuki/Ayu's arc.) Nothing feels extra or wasted, and each arc comes to a satisfying conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nKanon is a glimpse at what the ideal harem VN adaptation should be. Repetition espouses the harem, allowing each arc to resonate on its own yet tethering it to a thematic principle. That being said, the faithfulness to the magical realism of the source material undermines the tone at times. Makoto's arc can be given a pass, as her overwhelming desire-turned-to-miraculous incarnation has mythological and folkloric roots. A relationship with a fox-turned-girl may be morally dubious, but the concept isn't entirely strange. Rather than the miracle itself, the real hiccup is the show's explanation, opting to introduce an extraneous character who has had a similar experience and can thus elucidate and dispel the mystical. The show also delves completely into Makoto's arc for three episodes, ruining the pacing by returning to the typical isolated arc structure of a harem in which the rest of the cast is largely ignored.\\n\\n\r\nMai's arc is the guiltiest of flouting aesthetic distance; dark, shounen-esque sword battles with invisible demons run completely perpendicular to the light slice of life school routine. The supernatural mechanics are given a half-assed explanation: Mai's healing powers somehow manifested themselves into fake beings with real, tangible consequences? The reasons are unidentified (not that everything needs to be; mystic and vague circumstances are often a given when dealing with supernatural phenomenon and are part of the appeal), but when a how is more or less provided, it's only natural to question the why. Her arc comes to a climax when she impales herself with her sword, after which she walks away completely unscathed. The scene is full of such bombast and unwarranted melodrama that the show, for the first and only time, truly flaunts its Key genetics. Thankfully, the subsequent arc, Shiori's, proves to be the most mature and profound, staying entirely grounded in realism and containing only one crying scene (of which is not even enacted by the arc's heroine). Interestingly, the final arc explores two characters, Ayu and Nayuki, simultaneously. As a sort of coda, the last episode restores Yuuichi's harem by revisiting the daily schedule, thus completing the Kanon.\\n\\n\r\nAs an addendum, I'd also like to praise the OP. The sweeping medium shot zoom in/outs are absolutely breathtaking; it looks as if a camera was actually used.",

            "content": "Kanon starts when our main male character, Aizawa Yuuichi, goes to live with his cousin, that he visited quite often when younger, but the deal is that he don't remember absolutely nothing of those days, but then he start being surrounded by these \"girls\" and the funny thing is the most part of them carried a little part of his past...\r\nStory:\r\nThe begging of Kanon is a little slow.. But is that a bad thing? Of course not! Because of the slow begging Kanon had the proper time to to introduce all the characters that needed and after that tell us what the Story line wouldbe. So when begins to close all the points that introduce in the early parts of the show ,you will realise that kannon is almost in the end. So that slow start is very helpful. Plus is quite enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nThis is one of the things really good about this series, not that kanon have really bad things about it, but the characters, in my opinion they are all very enjoyable, Yuuichi is a very interesting character, his personallity is just awesome, and the way that he interact with people is very realist, this may sound very simple, but it have so much anime these days that failed miserably in this area. But i need to point that i just found funny the fact that the most part of the persons that he interacts is mostly girls it puts me thinking that maybe he is trying to buid a harem, and no one realized, (Poor Yuuichi).\\n\r\nAnd the girls, also very weel done, they are all very different from each other, and that makes that the interactig between them never boring.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nI will be honest here, i was a little apprehensive in watching Kanon, because it was from 2006, and i already watched some anime from that year, (more or less) that the art was unbearable, i don't think that the Art makes an Anime, but the truth is that If the Art is Good, is a really nice bonus. And i dont think that exist anime watchers that dont like to see really good animation and Great Art. And Kanon made a really nice joob in that part. A fun fact is that you can notice that the anime is a little old just by looking in the eyes and the hair of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nI should researched a little bit before saying anything about this topic, but i think that the soundtracks are from a piano (at lest i hope so), and like everyone knows, tastes in music varies from person to person. I enjoyed the music quite a lot.. in the start. But more to the ending i was getting a little tired of hearing always that style of music. But the anime dont drop the quality because of that, is just that this kind of music is just not my favorite. However i need to say that i really like the opening, but again, the ending,  it was just not for me.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nIn the end even though I dislike some things about this anime (minor things by the way). I really enjoyed watching Kanon, and you can see that, because i am making a review (my first one by the way) if i didn't found this anime good i wouldn't make a review (maybe if i hated i would also make one). I really recommend this anime to every one. Even more if you like Mystery, Supernatural and a lot of emotional scenes. It exist a really high chance of re-watching this anime in the Future, or at lest the last episode.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThanks to all that read my review, like i already said this is my first one, and i tried my best to make it efficient and short. (Quite failed by the way).\\n\r\nIf you found something in my review that you don't agree, or if you want help me improve my reviews, you can send me a private message. By only doing that it would help me a lot.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

The whole supernatural part wasn't a plus for me but that's just my opinion. I also disliked how they kind of shoved away Mai and her friend. I would have liked it more if they kept playing a active role. \r\nIt was also quite weird how the little Ayu was wandering around and how she actually made a physical impression on everybody (once again, supernatural). I think episode 23 (the saddest episode imo) was the best though. I sometimes prefer sad endings and I think thatthey should have wrapped it up at episode 23. The happy ending was good though but that is why I gave this anime a 9/10 and not a 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nP.S.\\n\r\nThe illusions/reality totally threw me back to how season 5 of House ended. A very complex theme to incorporate in a show, but when done correctly, it can be something amazing.",

Due to the fact that all the answers are there in each episode, you just never look at the subtle clues or subtext which gives would you a hit of realisation when the ending of Kanon tells you what you've been missing out! \r\nThe story is also very enjoyable and funny, whist having 'mild' romance, which in my opinion, is the perfect middle area. Though, i'll 'only' give this a 9, as theending was -slightly- anticlimatic, almost as Key was too hurried to tie the knots off at the very last episode, to make it all fit into 24 episodes. If it wasn't for the -slightly- anticlimatic ending, it would be a solid 10.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe eyes just look straight through you. While it perhaps, isn't as realistic as clannad or the later Key animes, the type of graphics is so fitting for the storyline, and exceptional for 2006. 10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nVery melancholic background music, catchy OP and ED, what more is needed? 10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: \\n\r\nPerhaps the best feature, all the characters are all so intriguing and entirely unique. They all have easy names to remember (!) and are all so like/loveable too. While they all have their good and bad points, you can't really have a favourite...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: \\n\r\nAgain, see 'Story' for why this isn't a 10. Albeit the rest of the story is a solid 10 for enjoyment. Has the correct balance of humor, sadness, reflection and drama so it's almost certain you'll finish this with a particularly warm afterglow.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\r\nThe story arcs are intriguing and are really enjoyable. The only bad thing i can say about this is that there is no season 2, and there is no point in watching this without subs and if it's not the middle of winter outside. I.e. It is COMPULSORY to watch this anime WITH subs and in the middle of winter only, in order to feel the full effects and its warming afterglow...  \\n",

            "content": "Background Info: Key visual novels have invariably been held in the utmost high regard for their intricate, unforeseen and ingenious take on the maudlin and sappy infamous genre labeled as harem romance. Fortunately their anime adaptations generally tend to carry these distinctive and dignifying traits, albeit with inevitable constraints and alterations. Subsequent Toei animations distasteful blunder Kanon(2002), Kyoto Animation was fortunately given the opportunity to reconcile and accommodate for this complication due to antecedent triumphant Key adaptations, and produced a magnificent, majestic and  commendable remake.\r\nStory: At first glance, Kanon inadvertently, unexpectedly and perhaps even unintentionally presents itself to be just a mere addition tothe abounding and excessive list of trite harems. Don\u2019t be deceived and swayed by any imprudent first impressions, for Kanon is more extensive, intricate and not to mention calamitous than early impressions can convey. \\n\\n\r\nRegarding Kanon\u2019s story, it\u2019s rejuvenating just how avant-garde and ingenious the fundamental layout genuinely is. The plot is effectively and elegantly distributed into divergent story-arcs practically, yet still all coalesce into a specific conclusion. Each respective arc is crucial and utilized for divulging each character\u2019s unique intricacy and complexity originating from their rather deplorable pasts. \\n\\n\r\nTypically when multiple diverging story-arcs are designed to be incorporated into a solitary plot, one would logically infer such a precarious and perilous endeavor would indubitably disintegrate under its own staggering design impediments. Yet miraculously rather than emerging as a convoluted and jumbled anime that leaves you with an inadequate conclusion, it\u2019s quite the opposite. In fact, each subsequent arc emerges more spectacular and riveting than the preceding, each consisting of distinct varying themes throughout. \\n\\n\r\nThemes: For Kanon, Kyoto Animation emphatically possessed a fanatical aspiration to attain greatness for the series, and they certainly did, in fact it almost reaches near perfection. The manner in which the varying themes are incorporated and integrated together is quite ingenious and inventive in practically every aspect. The style in which the themes consummately support one another is profound and wondrous. No individual theme is prominent or prevailing during any point within the progressing plot. \\n\\n\r\nThe comedy is hilarious and convivial, especially since it\u2019s always unforeseen, without being incongruous and contrived. Drama in addition to the Slice of Life elements were magnificent and remarkable despite some overdramatizing. Unfortunately, the Romance tends to be frivolous and scanty at times, albeit for the predominant duration still manages to be distinguished and meritorious. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Each character is riveting, captivating, and very dynamic, with imperfections and shortcomings, as well as unique strengths. They genuinely resemble real people evolving rather than static and stable characters with facile archetypical personalities that are being dragged along by the story. The seiyuu cast chosen for Kanon was indubitably superlative, seasoned professionals that were very enthusiastic as well as devoted to contributing their utmost for this astounding adaptation, and by no means disappointed. Their near excellence is in part a direct result of a predominant majority re-voicing their character roles, or previous contemporary work with Kyoto Animation. \\n\\n\r\nArt: The landscape and background art is serene, vibrant, and angelic with a surreal radiant tonality emanating. Motion animation is where Kyoto Animation excels so it\u2019s no surprise that every miniscule motion is awe-inspiring. However when KyoAni gets aroused and is eagerly awaiting to flex its glamorous technological muscles onto your screen, you will immediately be blow away with breath-taking sensations and likely defecate.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Overall the music throughout Kanon, whether it be the exhilarating and omnipotent OP and ED songs or the serene, sublime BGMs, are exquisite.  \\n\\n\r\nMessage: The imperative and essential message in Kanon is conveyed in a rather obscure and roundabout manner, likely overlooked by the passive viewer. As our fellow protagonist Sayuri Kurata acutely and adequately proclaimed while listening to Canon, \u201cIt would be nice if life changed slowly but surely, while being seemingly unchanged from day to day\u201d. This statement within Kanon itself is very ironic since the bewildering title itself originated from composer Johann Pachelbel\u2019s Canon. Canon is merely a melody and crescendo that gradually repeats itself, in a beautiful and peaceful manner.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Kanon is an inventive and well executed senimental anime that consists of an abundant variety of admirable qualities. It audaciously dares to venture where no previous harem romance has gone before, and exceeds expectations in the taxing process. Yet despite all its intricate, groundbreaking and sophisticated characteristics, gallant effort and innovative, not to mention superbly clever augmentations just simply weren\u2019t enough to bring Kanon to perfection. \\n\r\nWistfully, in the end, Kanon is still hindered and handicapped by its premise and fundamental origins, a mere adaptation that desperately aspires to differentiate itself from its origins. Though it still achieves in making a notable/distinguished name and reputation for itself among the list of very remarkable, outstanding and meritorious anime. Despite all of Kanons unfortunate deficiencies, it still is a truly excellent and accomplished anime that was certainly well above its competitors and kindred alike that deserves more praise than it\u2019s frequently given. \\n\\n\r\nIn addition to my conclusion I would like to take this time to thank seiyuu Tomoko Kawakami-sama for all her glamorous and fabulous work she did for anime. While struggling through several harrowing years of cancer she unwillingly had to sacrifice what she loved doing for the remainder of her life. Kawakami sadly passed away in 2011 despite several extensive surgeries, may she forever rest in peace, she will certainly be missed. \\n\\n\r\nAny feedback would be sincerely appreciated, will readily listen and discuss any opinions concerning the quality or layout of my reviews as to better future reviews. These reviews are designed to assist the viewer, not to merely state my opinions of it just for fun, thanks!\\n",

            "content": "This was a disappointment. I was expecting something as great as Clannad, but I guess I set my standards too high.\r\nThe story is fine and pretty creative, but everything else about the show ruins it for me.\r\nThe art is nearly identical to Clannad, except for one thing. For some reason, their eyes are all blurry and it's very odd as to why they did this.\r\nWhy does every girl in the show need a special weird noise like \"uguu\"? That's all for sound.\r\nNow, the art is the same style as Clannad, but that gives it no excuse to look like carbon copies of Clannad's characters, justwith different colors. Like that bag carrier guy. Isn't he just color swapped kouhei? And the girl he's with seems so much like Kyou. And the uguu girl, isn't that ushio? Finally, the main character. He looks like if Kyon from Haruhi and Tomoya had a child this is what he'd look like. This isn't really a BAD thing, but it distracted me from actually watching and enjoying the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, meh. I felt oddly melancholic when watching this and so I didn't want to watch anymore. Also, I realize just now most of this review is comparing the characters with other characters from other series... Whatever, I didn't enjoy Kanon the end.\\n",

            "content": "**Spoilers**\r\nI can't believe what I just watched. This has to be the worst addition to the clannad,air genre of anime. Yuuichi is one of the most detestable protagonists I have ever encountered. Now youmight be asking why,well it's all thanks to two problems. His lack of memory regarding his trip to the town 7 years ago. Also how he is a massive asshole to the women in his life. So let's start off with the first girl we see,Makoto. So she is supposedly the reincarnation of a fox that Yuuichi helped out when he was at the town last and had to leave behind when break was over. Now she is a person and is in love with Yuuichi. So already we're using the sad animal card which is just incredibly lazy and obnoxious. After a while her form begins to deteriorate and her mental state begins to degrade as well. So Yuuichi loving makoto decides he's going to stay with her until she \"dies\" and he does. He stays with her skipping school and only making sure she is happy. What a nice guy,right? So on one of her final days she remarks she wants to marry Yuuichi. On her final day Yuuichi takes her to the hill they meet and does a little wedding ceremony. Nothing mind blowing but a nice little story. Immediately afterwards Yuuichi is FIGHTING DEMONS IN SCHOOL AT NIGHT! What the hell?! So his classmate mai can see demons and he decides to help her fight them. A bunch of stuff happens (some really nice looking fight scenes) and both mai and sayuri end up in the hospital after the \"demons\" are expelled. Not once does Yuuichi go to or is it implied that he went to the hospital to visit them after the initial visit. Keep in mind they were in there for months. Next is the sickly girl Shiori,after a lot of hanging out Shiori and Yuuichi go on a date and things really progress from there. So this already feels greasy and the whole Makoto thing which wasnt long ago at this point. So Shiori kisses him on her last night that she is able to move freely because after that night she will be in the hospital and most likely die. Very sad but Yuuichi really loves her so he's ganna support her. Nope. He never once goes to visit her as she is DYING! Instead of visiting his dying girlfriend in the hospital he elects to start showing interest in this annoying girl called ayu. She's your generic moe loli and generally obnoxious. So they end up kissing as his GIRLFRIEND IS DYING IN THE HOSPITAL! And of course ayu is some spooky specter and says she cant be together with Yuuichi anymore. So after what feels like any endless amount of flash backs to this goddamn bench he remembers that seven years ago SHE FUCKING DIED IN HIS ARMS! WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU MEAN HE FORGOT ABOUT THAT?!?!?!?!?!?! I dont even understand how this is a thing. He forgot his friend died in his hands. For Christ sake there's a line of stupidity and this show left it wayyyy in the read view mirror. So some more stupid bullshit happens and we arrive at the last episode. Turns out spooky ghost girl is actually just in a coma and wakes up when Yuuichi  finds out about it. Also Shiori the sickly girl is all fine now. Great. Also the two girls that got fucked up by the demons are fine now too. Wonderful. And the show explains the spooky ayu as a illusion Yuuichi did himself so he wouldn't be a sad panda. So what about all the people ayu interacted with? Is my boy Yuuichi actually itachi in disguise and put them all in his genjutsu? In conclusion Yuuichi is a piece of shit and I hope he tackles a train. This show is trash,you'd be better off watching clannad.",

            "content": "I really believed that this anime was going to have a similar plot line to many others and over all was going to be very boring. I finally decided to take a chance with it when several people kept recommending it to me. As I continued to watch though episode and episode I knew I was very wrong about Kanon, this anime is very different then most.\r\nStory 9/10: At first like I said I felt like this anime was slow, I didn't really know what was going on, at even some points I was totally confused. After the anime progressed the backgrounds about the girlsslowly started to unravel and I felt my self being drawn into the show, wanting to find out more and more. It actually has a great concept throughout the whole anime. It, personally touches me in a different way then maybe other people since I have actually have experiences like the ones shown in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10: The art in the anime was fantastic, they drew everything so well, especially the environment and snow. It made me feel like I was actually part of the show. I  loved how they drew the characters as well.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10: The sound was fantastic, I could hear them clearly though out the entire anime and the music was incredible. The music they selected fitted perfectly in the anime and what was going on during the time.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10: Each character seemed to pop out at me. Their very unique and creative personalities was one of the main things that really drew me into the show. I liked how they all had their own style. I also like the fact that not all characters got along at first like they usually do in some animes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10: Watching this was very enjoyable, not once was I ever truly bored with it. It always seemed like their was something new happening in each episode and they really never dragged anything on longer then it needed to be.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10: I give it a 9 overall, I really don't like just handing out 10s since I think that nothing is ever perfect. I really recommend anyone that is into  romance animes with some tragedy in it. It is a really great anime and I feel like everyone should at least give it one chance.",

            "content": "Kanon is one of Key's best work with its' broad and various character types, masterful storytelling, and how it challenges the characters to deal with the hardships of life; such as rejection, problems within family relationships, tragic and life threatening accidents, etc..., and how they overcome those obstacles. I wish Key had continued making stories centered on the Kanon characters in their own After Story...such as meeting Yuuichi's parents, Yuuichi and those he cares for experiencing life as adults, and the like.\r\n          Nayuki is my favorite girlof the series because she is a total sweetheart. I equally love the primary heroine Ayu too, she's a cutie and quite quirky, and the friendship she and Nayuki share is adorable. Mai and Sayuri are characters I'm fond of too and what they share as friends is very endearing. Makoto is quite a vivacious character and her lively nature is entertaining to see, a shame what befalls her though later into her arc. With Shiori, she is a good character, but all I can see her in regards to a relationship with Yuuichi is like siblings. Nayuki, Mai, or Ayu are my top choices for Yuuichi's romantic prospects.\\n\\n\r\n          Im happy that this 2006 version cast Tomokazu Sugita as Yuuichi, he's an amazing seiyuu and Mariko Kouda's Nayuki was so moe. Akiko is my favorite Key mom, she has a lot of great qualities that I admire about her...even though she has that mysterious bad jam she makes...it's ingredients are one of the fun mysteries of anime. All in all, Kanon 2006 is an anime I highly recommend.",

            "content": "Part of the trio of Key Animations lovely animations, this one doesn\u2019t hold back. The simple and cute story mixed with a little bit of comedy and the art style of a simple dating sim game works with the type of music and slight cuteness that one would understand from this. Although this is praised so much, there are some things that seem like they were just lost or done rather badly.\r\nI could see this show being practically a mirror dimension of Clannad. We have the plain main character, the small cute girl, the dense girl, the strong silent type, the sickly type, and soon. We get the same characters from Clannad and almost the same storylines as well. And yet, the storylines also fit with some of the magical feel that Air has too. If you want me to list out a way of watching the two shows, I say start with Air or Clannad, then go to Kanon, then the other one. They seem to blend into each other. Instead of the girl being the one losing memories, it\u2019s the boy.\\n\\n\r\nThe storylines are rather sweet and I just love the romance involved in it but I feel we don\u2019t get enough time with any of the characters at all (except the main character). It should have been longer if they were going to do this type of show and give us a bigger variety to the show. If you\u2019re giving us a harem, then make it a harem, not a half assed one.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is special, most of the time beautiful, soft but well detailed. The times that it lacks actually don\u2019t take much away from the show as they are few and far between. I do have to say after seeing some pictures of the older one, I believe this artwork to be much better. I do ask how wise the girls are wearing the really short skirts in the snow and not looking one bit cold. Seriously, why do they do that? And I also wonder the only adult that really is shown looks like she is the same age as her daughter. Other characters really do look like they have the same face, looking like they just changed the girls eye color and hair color.\\n\\n\r\nThe English voices are not really Moe but they don\u2019t try to be. I like that about the show. There is a sense of two worlds in the show because of the English and the Japanese dub being slightly different. The music is what makes the show in how awesome it is most of the time. I love hearing the piano pieces and really want to the sound track to it.\\n\\n\r\nI love the show even though the troubles they have in it and the odd non-moe characters the English dub gave me. I really feel that even though Key\u2019s shows aren\u2019t really the best, they are something to check out.",

            "content": "Even though shows of this type generally don't really stand out and at times they can be very generic, this particular show had a lot going for it right from the start.\r\nFirstly, this anime is basically made by the same team that gave us AIR a few years ago. And, much like AIR, Kanon is based on a video game by Visual Art's/Key, who seems to have a knack for creating storylines that have a certain edge of tragedy around them. That time, I didn't expect AIR to be very good when we started watching it, but it was. It took perhaps the most MOE'ishcharacter designs I had ever seen and actually created an involving story around them, one that, granted, kinda bombed near the end, but nevertheless took me completely by surprise.\\n\\n\r\nThe original Kanon didn't hold the same promise, but sadly ended up being too short for its own good, amongst other minor flaws. Given that this new remake has twice the episode number along with greatly improved visuals can only mean that Kanon 2006 is better in every respect. And while I haven't watched the original, in my opinion by far enough to say that I am certain that this version of Kanon IS an improvement on the original by this magnitude.\\n\\n\r\nSo, basically, the only hurdle you -- as a viewer -- will have to overcome is this:\\n\\n\r\nLOOK INTO MY EYES....\\n\\n\r\nThis is pretty much the facial designs of every single female (save one) in this show, regardless of age. Indeed, the MOE levels of this show is damn well near critical condition, and it will turn away some of its prospective viewers. All the same, given the art of the old show, Kyoto Animation has done an admirable job of having the characters at the very least look their ages for the most part. (The only exception that comes to mind being Nayuki's mother, who don't really look all that older than her daughter.)\\n\\n\r\nNot only that, but the viewers also has to deal with two of the characters, namely one Ayu and one Makoto, expressing their discomfort by utilizing onomatopoeticon that will throw viewers into diabetic shocks. \"Ughuuu.\", Ayu mumbles each time Yuuichi chastises her. \"Auuuu\", Makoto whines when her prank plans fail, or when she too gets chastized. Couple that with the eyes you can see above here, and you got some hurdles to overcome.\\n\\n\r\nOnce you do, however, you might be surprised to find that Kanon is a quite effective character-driven drama, where the characters and their personality traits and backstories gives Kanon its backbone. And they all have backstories that will be explained in, I assume, greater detail than the original Kanon.\\n\\n\r\nThe first bonus in this show compared to similar shows come in the form of Yuuichi himself. He's surprisingly outspoken for a male romantic/harem lead, even snarky at times. In fact, he's fairly reminiscent of a certain Kyon from another wonderfully funny show I've watched. By no means is he a jerk, though, except perhaps when strictly necessary.\\n\\n\r\nThe girls are... an interesting bunch, and it's mostly about them the show is centered. Most of them do share a past with Yuuichi that the show will explore in turn. On a positive note, very few of them share a romantic interest in Yuuichi, which allows the show to avoid falling into the same kind of haremish trappings that made Shuffle such a monumental piece of crap. Meetings and circumstances, as they were, are handled mostly through character interaction, with flashbacks filling in the blanks as the past is revealed more in detail. Add to that the subtle workings of supernatural elements, used to great effect in the backstories of those involved, and you got yourself a proper mystical drama.\\n\\n\r\nMake no mistake, though; Kanon is not always a happy story. Depending on your perspective regarding a lot of the scenes, tragedy plays a large role in how things end up, and Kanon will on more than one occation have you trying to force lumps in your throat back down again. It's a curious thing, too, seeing a scene where an incredibly strong desire paves the way for a miracle to happen, and the steep price to be paid for it is nonetheless what makes the first arc's conclusion so poignant, despite the several elements that would convince you otherwise at first glance of this show.\\n\\n\r\nBear in mind that I generally don't like tragic shows, and that goes double for shows that are tragic for the sake of being tragic and also for the sake of coming off as artsy or just plain weird. Kanon is neither of these. Rather, Kanon makes use of the tragic or near-tragic elements in the show to make you appreciate the lighter moments even more. And, unlike AIR, at no point does Kanon jump the shark trying to be too big for its own britches with its ending.\\n\\n\r\nI am delighted to see that Kanon has been shown the same courtesy as AIR by being picked up for US release. It's been a compelling show from beginning to end, with very few dead spots (no pun intended.) Having finished Kanon, Kyoto Animation has turned its eyes towards the next Visual Art's title, namely Clannad. And if I can expect the same lush animation and gorgeous art as in this show, along with the same strength of character, then I definitely will be looking into that as well. As it is, Kanon 2006 comes with my heartfelt recommendations. Look past the MOE design and the huge eyes, and look towards the story behind it. You'll be very glad you did.",

            "content": "A, \"mysterious\" voice resembling a little girl narrates her, \"dream\" of snow falling upon a town known to have some, \"supernatural\" power (also said by the protagonist's aunt)...\r\nWhat a nice, but very, \"Key-ish\" way to start off this series. Usually, when Key introduces a girl's arc, there's always a supernatural element that correlates with what is currently happening or going to occur between the protagonist and the girl.  \r\nNow, I wanted to watch this because I adore Key animes and also, because of the winter season and vibe, I felt like why not go whole hog with watching an anime that takes place duringthe winter.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is overall, pretty well done in comparison to the 2002 version in terms of art and music. Also, I find the story to be quite interesting, but a little cliche in terms of the harem-esque feel from Key except, these girls help the protagonist, Yuichi, have recollections of memories of the town he often visited as a child and somehow, forgot.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of progression and flow, it was really nice how even though each arc particularly focuses on 1 girl, they DON'T completely focus on that one girl and omit the other characters. In fact, it was quite unique that Key did, let's just say, \"house keep\" on what the other girls, who aren't part of the particular girl's arc, but will be soon, are doing so that as viewers, we can keep a mental note as to who was who, which was viewer-friendly to those who can't remember people's name like moi, myself. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, there were some flaws I found in this anime. I felt like most of the arcs, even though the flow of progression in the anime was good, it was satisfactorily executed. From a, \"biased\" point of view, I'm not a big fan of the whole reincarnation idea that was presented in the 1st arc and for that particular part to reappear in one of the last episodes of the anime, surely had me confused. Also, the 3rd arc that involved the frail girl, Shiori, was pretty insignificant in terms of contributing to Yuichi's character development. In fact, it played no role in it except for repairing family ties between herself and her older sister. So clearly, this arc in my opinion, was a cop out. Now, my MAIN problem with this anime is that each girl in their respective arc were played as pawns for plot device purposely to increase Yuichi's character development and once their arc were cleared and satisfied, they become spectators and just give subtle hints to once again, increase Yuichi's character development.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I did mention about these girls being a plot device to Yuichi's character development as a negative, BUT in terms of executing Yuichi as a changed person, well, that's my positive. He wasn't the same person as he was in Episode 1. In fact, I grew to like him and he developed really good character development (due to the girls) and that line he said, \"I've been living in a dream...\" was like the, \"Ah-ha!\" moment for him in terms of self-discovery and it aided him to help escape from his dream from ever becoming a realistic tragedy (aka a Happy Ending).\\n\\n\r\nLong story short, light hearted comedic and supernatural anime that pulls at your heart strings, with great art, animation, and music with ONLY the protagonist undergoing excellent character development. I would recommend this to someone who's open for interpretation and loves how supernatural events modernize to a slice of life situation. My actual rating of this anime including decimals is 8.6/10.0.",

Because without it, we can't remember anything what happened to our lives.\r\nIn 1st - 3rd episodes I thought that this anime is boring. But when I watched the next episodes, I laughed, I became serious and my tears appeared without me noticing.\r\nFor me this is the best anime that made by Key.\r\nThis boy is Aizawa, Yuichi.\r\nAizawa Yuichi often visited his cousin, Nayuki, in the city when he was young. But one dayhe needs to move to his own town/city.\\n\\n\r\nAs he returned to he's cousin's house and planning of staying there, he suddenly forgot all what happened seven years ago, but as he encounters the 5 mysterious girls he was capable of remembering his memory little by little.\\n\\n\r\nThe first 5 - 9 episodes(?) is all about Yuichi and Makoto.\\n\r\nMakoto suddenly appeared at front of Yuichi and she said that she can't remember anything even her house, her name, her parents... so Yuichi had no choice but to take her to his cousin's house. As times goes by, Yuichi remembered of a fox that was became his bestfriend and it named Satoko which is also the same as Makoto's. Later it reaveled that Mokoto is a fox, which his best friend before. She made a miracle and transformed in human. Later on Makoto disappeared 'cause one of the ingredient to make a miracle is \"Life\"\\n\\n\r\nThe 10 - 14 episodes(?) is all about Yuichi and Mai.\\n\r\nYuichi met Mai at his new school in his cousin's city. \\n\r\nMai is so mysterious so Yuichi got interested in her. Yuichi discovered that Mai is always at school to haunt a demon. Yuichi is so surprised because of that.\\n\r\nYuichi and Mai became close and he bacame his lunchmate together with Sayuri (Mai's bestfriend). One day his cousin, Nayuki, gave her a headband with bunny style.XD at that moment Yuichi remembered that he already met Mai seven years ago. When they were young they're always playing at the ground with full of grasses.\\n\r\nYuichi hastily goes to Mai and he explained everything and he also said that the demon are created by her own heart.\\n\r\nAnd he also discovered that their school is their field where they used to play.\\n\\n\r\n15 - 19 episodes(?) is all about Yuichi and Shiori.\\n\r\nYuichi met Shiori when Shiori got filled with snow by the \"bump\" of Ayu on the tree when Yuichi is chasing Ayu.\\n\r\nYuichi always see Shiori at their school not wearing uniform and he thought thay she was waiting someone.\\n\r\nYuichi and Shiori got close and they were always meet at the school ground. Yuichi discovered that Shiori has an illness that can't be healed even with using a medicine and he also discovered that she is the little sister of Kaori.\\n\r\nKaori is avoiding and denying that she has a little sister, 'cause she don't want to hurt if the time comes that Shiori's  gonna die.\\n\r\nYuichi, as protagonist, do anything to make their bonding and relationship became alive again. And he made it. Kaori is now taking care of Shiori at the hospital.\\n\\n\r\nThe 20 - 24 episodes(?) is all about the past between Yuichi and Ayu and Yuichi and Nayuki.\\n\r\nNayuki is Yuichi's cousin. Even though that they are cousin, Yuichi can't remember all what happened between them.\\n\r\nLater on, Nayuki made a snow bunny and she asked Yuichi if he remember anything. Yuichi only remember a little because of it.\\n\r\nThen, one day. Nayuki's mother, Akiko, had a car accident (this is where I cry). Nayuki blamed herself 'cause she think that if she had never said to her mother to buy a strawberry cake she will never got to this accident. So she cried and cried and cried. Yuichi remembered. Yuichi remembered that seven years ago he is crying at the bench and Nayuki go to him and gave him a snow bunny but Yuichi crashed and destroy the snow bunny.XD\\n\r\nBut Yuichi wondered why did he do it to Nayuki.\\n\r\nAyu. Ayu is so very mysterious girl. Ayu always attack as a greeting to Yuichi.\\n\r\nOne day Ayu brought Yuichi at her school at the forest. As they reached the school they saw a cut tree, Yuichi was so surprised because Ayu suddenly cried.\\n\r\nAyu look at her bag but her bag was empty. Ayu ran to the other part of the forest and she dug 'cause she might found the item that she's missing. Yuichi helped her, as they finished digging Ayu said \"sorry\" to Yuichi 'cause this time they might not meet this time. Yuichi cried and he wants to discover the past of them. Now, Yuichi remembered that he had a friend where they used to play to a very big tree  and the name od his friend is \"Ayu\". Ayu likes to climb at the tree so because of that Yuichi became scared ''cause she might fall. \\n\r\nYuichi gave Ayu a gift and he said that he's gift can grant 3 wishes. Ayu asked 2 wishes so Yuichi is waiting for the third wish but Ayu said that it is enough. They buried the angel toy(the gift) somewhere at the forest and whoever found this angel toy will have a one wish.\\n\r\nLater on they had a chit chat at their school while Ayu was on the branch of the tree and Yuichi is on the foot of the tree. After finishing their conversation, Yuichi let Ayu to come down, but Ayu wants to stare at the whole city more. Then, a strong wind blows up and because of that Ayu fell.\\n\r\nAfter remembering that Yuichi went to the forest and find the toy. Many thigs happened after that. \\n\r\nLater on he found the toy and he went to the \"school\" (School because in their past they said that this tree is gonna be their school) As he went to the school he found Ayu and he gave back the toy to her. He ask for the third wish now. Ayu said that her last wish is to forget her.(this is where i cried. T_T) But Yuichi said that he can't do it.\\n\\n\r\nNow. it all make sense! This is why he dumped Nayuki.\\n\r\nAfter that, many miracles happened! Mai healed, Shiori healed and also Akiko was healed! maybe that's Ayu last wish.XD\\n\r\nYuichi also discovered that Ayu is not dead she is still alive! hooray!XDD\\n\r\nAyu is confined at the hospital because of the accident.

            "content": "Kanon is a truly touching story in my eyes, it affected me quite emotionally, at times making me laugh and smile, while others made me cry. It remains to this day my favorite Key work. The KyoAni version of Kanon is truly a beautiful masterpiece and it is an anime that deserves the love it gets from fans who love the series. I love how all the elements of the series flow naturally, and the touching stories of our main characters and those around them. I came to love all of them and found qualities that I admired in each of them. The music isvery beautiful and the BGM for this series is among my favorites. The gorgeous artwork of the winter setting is a sight to behold and I just love the sunset scenes that accompany the snowy backdrop. The character designs are an improvement on the 2002 Toei version overall.\\n\\n\r\n*Yuuichi Aizawa-I loved how much he cared for each of the girls he's connected to and how he tried to be a good person to all of them. Yuuichi also has a fun sense of humor whenever he's being a tease.\\n\\n\r\n*Ayu Tsukimiya-Her child-like charisma is what moved me the most about her and how she was always true to herself, Ayu was in every way an angel, with her sweet and bright nature.\\n\\n\r\n*Nayuki Minase-A personal favorite of mine, I loved her kind and gentle nature she possessed, Nayuki is a loving and caring person to everyone around her and I love how she has such a positive attitude.\\n\\n\r\n*Makoto Sawatari-Despite her tsundere personality, Makoto is one of those rare ones I like, I loved her fun presence, she was like a ray of sunshine and loved the free spirit she is.\\n\\n\r\n*Mai Kawasumi-This cool beauty is amazing, from her talent as a swordswoman to how she is protective of her best friend Sayuri Kurata, I love every aspect to Mai's character and how multi-faceted she is.\\n\\n\r\n*Shiori Misaka-Even with all the things she had gone through physically and emotionally, despite all of that, she maintains her kind and sweet nature and lives her life to the fullest.\\n\\n\r\nI loved Tomokazu Sugita's performance as Yuuichi, Yui Horie as Ayu Tsukimiya, Mariko Kouda as Nayuki Minase, Yukari Tamura as Mai Kawasumi, and Yuko Minaguchi as Akiko Minase most of all. Each of them did a great job as their respective character and the dub voices did a good job as well, bringing their own charm into the character.\\n\\n\r\nEach of the stories for the Kanon cast touched me in more ways than one, such as the strong value of bonds between family and friends and to believe in hope and miracles, no matter how small. I also enjoyed how the series challenged the characters in difficult situations and set obstacles for them to overcome and face, and each was handled in a realistic manner. I believe that with everything that the characters go through, the rewards in the end are each deserved and not handed out to them out of pity. I truly reccommend Kanon 2006, and I say again that IT IS definitely worthy of the love it gets and is deserving of being a masterpiece, to give this beautiful series a 5 or lower, to not be touched by the story and it's characters, is in my opinion an insult to a great and inspirational anime.",

            "content": "First review so I shall try my best to give a fair assessment. I also shouldn't have any spoilers; the most I'll reveal is \"During this character's arc...\"\r\nStory: As a huge fan of Clannad and Clannad AS, Kanon met my expectations for another fantastic slice of life drama. Since the story follows a progression which focuses on one heroine at a time, it is easy to follow and avoids forcing the viewer to keep track of multiple arcs at the same time. But if you have seen Clannad, be wary that there are many similarities between that and Kanon, which may lead to predictable endings.Nonetheless, the tales are gripping and will induce tears. However, I would say the story does fall off a little bit after the first heroine's arc; it becomes a little repetitive since almost all the heroines have a supernatural element to them. \\n\\n\r\nArt: If you're a fan of Key's style, you'll enjoy this art. Really beautiful animation of nature as always. \\n\\n\r\nSound: I would say this was this anime's weakest aspect. For Clannad fans, they know part of what made Clannad so tear-jerking was the superb music choice. In Kanon however, I felt like some of the songs didn't fit the mood at all, or they didn't exemplify the mood enough. I would honestly say better music would've bolstered the anime enormously. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I love the protagonist: he is funny yet kind. The heroines themselves all have fantastic personalities and you will definitely fall in love with them immediately. The writers did a great job varying the heroines' personalities as we have the kind and innocent ones, the badass ones, the shy one etc. But once again, Clannad shares the same kind of distribution, so it could get boring for Clannad fans. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I had fun watching this anime. My expectations may have been a bit high because I know it was produced by the same studio as the one that made Clannad, but it certainly didn't disappoint. Anyone who likes romantic slice of life dramas mixed in with some supernatural elements should watch this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of this genre. Key does an amazing job doing what they do best: character development. If you enjoy watching growth and relationships develop, definitely watch this anime.",

            "content": "I will start by saying that this is in my top 3 most favorite anime list.\r\nThe things i loved the most are: \r\nThe storey and howcapturing it is and how every episode is important to the overall understanding of the storey. I dont think a single episode is irrelevent to the jigsaw of the main storey.\r\nI love the character art and how detailed they are as well as the weather and environment art like snow fall and busy towns, it adds a sense of reality to the scenes rather than having a barren wasteland resemblance.\r\nThe sounds in Kanon are great. The characters voices really suitthem well. Eah character have their own theme, which play everytime they appear. characters in the background will have their own conversations rather than just being quiet which again is a mirror of reality.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are arguably the cutest, funniest and most different to each other i have seen so far in an anime. Yuichi multiple times which is funny to watch and adds humor to the \"darkness\" of the storey. All characters seem to have sad (or in one case, life threatening) misfortunes or pasts which makes you feel for them. \\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment of this anime was through the roof! I looked forward to every episode so much and wish i could rewatch it (whilst forgetting what happens).\\n\\n\r\nOverall i give Kanon a rare 10/10 because, as the rating describes it: A masterpiece! I certainly recommend watching it.",

            "content": "So after a friends recommendation I watched Kanon another of what I call a feel series much like Clannad. Overall the series is good and makes for something that you can watch if you are looking for a slice of life that can pull a few heartstrings. \r\nThe story of Kanon is similar to other slice of life anime with similar themes. Our main character Yuuichi is the protagonist who finds himself caught in the affairs of others while dealing with his own demons of the past. The story is divided into four arcs for the main female characters Yuuichi associates with. You got Makotothe funny girl with amnesia, Mai the quiet girl who is mysterious, Shiori the weak girl who like ice cream in the cold and Ayu the nice girl who will continuously say \"Uguu\". Yuuichi has his own story about getting used to the town he forgot which is something that develops as he helps the other characters find their way. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is pretty good and has its fare share of touching moments. This series focuses more on what happens when a great amount of time has passed rather then what has currently happened. All the characters stories are center on the change of a persons and state of mind and what has happened to the world around them as time passed. It focuses on how places we once cherished are long gone or long changed while the friends once close years ago are long forgotten.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in the series is good in my opinion for an anime made in 2006. some of the animations are smooth and things are really shiny. The character designs are pretty average I would say considering most of the cast are wearing uniforms ninety percent of the time. The animation and art really shine in the knight scenes where light is used in an effect to emphasis change and mystery. \\n\\n\r\n The music of this series is pretty much an average anime soundtrack apart from the main theme. I have been watching the subbed version of the anime where the voices are Japanese. Some of the voice acting is average most of the time in terms of emotion. However in scenes where it really mattered the sadness in characters voices brings you a bit closer to them. \\n\\n\r\nThe Characters of Kanon are interesting especially the four main girls whom which I won't say much of to avoid spoilers. Makoto for example I did not really like her at first but came to like her character the more I learned about them. Mai is one of those quiet characters that I usually like a lot in a series and I have come to admire them when they display emotion. Shiori I felt had a really short arc but made a good impact on the main character when they're arc ended. Ayu backstory had the most impact on me when they got into her character in her arc. \\n\\n\r\nYuuichi is a pretty plain MC at first but he becomes a love him or you hate him character as the story goes on. He is more of a character trying to redeem himself then to better himself as he come into some conflict with his own past. In the end I have come to like his character. The other supporting characters are only there to help carry the story a bit further while Yuuichi Aunt and Cousin are the most strongest because they have a major impact on him. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the series as a whole and am glad where they left it where most of the lose strings are tied up. My overall rating for this would be a nine out ten. \\n",

            "content": "For those of you who have seen Clannad/Afterstory, I highly recommend you watch Kanon (2006). There are striking, nostalgic similarities between the characters, arcs, and music, but like Clannad, Kanon offers a unique story that can be described as truly magical and touching. \r\nStory: Although at first Kanon may seem like having a straightfoward story, the anime does an extremely good job of culminating the events together towards the end. However, by no means is the story linear, as there is much interpretation involved with understanding the plot. Like Clannad, Kanon heavily uses supernatural elements in the story, but in my opinion, has better integrationof those elements into the story, creating an immense feeling of surrealism. The twists in this story, especially prevalent in the end, will likely be mindboggling. Together, this is what made the ending of Kanon so memorable and beautiful in my viewpoint, but at times, also confusing. \\n\\n\r\nArt: Stunning. That's all I have to say about the snowy scenery in Kanon. The setting really adds to the \"feel\" of the anime. The first thing that pops into my mind when I think of Kanon is the snow, and the animators did an amazing job incorporating it into the story and themes. \\n\\n\r\nSound: Kanon has a great range of musical pieces that I can only describe as peaceful but also saddening, reminiscent of Clannad. Combining the music together with the art, Kanon does an amazing job of portraying a dreamy theme that is the basis of the entire story and its name. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Without a nearly as captivating story in the beginning and middle, the thing that kept me watching was definitely the characters. The character personalities and appearances seem similar to Clannad, but personally I liked them more. In my opinion, there was more development and connection for the general cast of characters (although I would have liked a bit more for some more significant ones). \\n\\n\r\nThe only reason I gave this anime a 9 is because I believe it had so much potential to really tug on audience emotions, but did exploit it as much as Clannad did. Overall, if you can't get enough of Clannad and want to watch a less sad, but a bit more magically heavy version of it, I highly recommend Kanon.",

            "content": "Kanon has been a huge emotional turmoil and hurdle to get over. To summarize, its good.\r\nFirstly, the aesthetics of the anime is simply bewildering. It is an anime released during late 2006 but oh my god, what a beautifully animated piece of art. The details, the emotions and even the clock on the wall is so beautifully animated. I dare say that it rivals modern anime in this aspect. Please do not look at the image put up here, it does not do it justice.\r\nThe sound definitely hit the sweet spot. The music used were perfect and fitting.\r\nThe story is good, very good. However, itdid not fully satisfy me. The reason is because the overall concept of the anime was well thought of. There are certain elements that just didn't tie well together. I had questions when the anime ended. The story had a conclusion but it didn't conclude to my standards. I had questions but no answers.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Kanon is the biggest reason you should watch the anime. The main character is not generic. This means that I do not identify him in categories like \"dumb and useless\" or \"overpowered\". He carves a personality for himself, stays loyal to it and broadcast it as who he is. This applies across the board towards all other characters but for the main characters who is the core of the story truly speaks for himself. \\n\\n\r\nOn the whole, Kanon is outstanding. It is an anime that tells a great story which is delivered through beautiful animation and soundtrack. The story which is brought to life because of the characters. Thus, Kanon was enjoyable which is the main criteria towards any series. If you are passing by, pick it up.",

You will experience every human emotion while watching this anime. You will cry, you will laugh, you will want to punch one of the characters in the face. Another thing is that this show will make you think, and it will try to get you to solve the puzzle that was Yuichi's past. Living in America, there is hardly any shows on television that make you think, there just mindless reality shows and stupid cartoons.But Kanon was a breath of fresh air. Some people say that anime is stupid, and I think that because they don't want to use their brain.\\n\r\nI loved all the characters in Kanon, except for one. They all have different personalities and likable traits. Nayuki likes strawberries, Mai is the quiet girl, Sayuri talkes in third person, ther is a lot more I could say about the girls, but I don't want to make this too long.\\n\r\nBottom Line is, this show is amazing, and it had everything in it, from demons to a damaged sister relationship. So check out this anime, and if you don't, your really missing out on a masterpiece.",

            "content": "Story: A very well done Slice of life with a supernatural side, Kanon is one of the best animes I have seen in quite some time. It tells the story of a boy who moves back to a town he used to visit 7 years ago, however he can\u2019t seem to remember anything about the town or its inhabitants. You get to follow along on his journey meeting others and uncovering his past , the good side and the bad side. 9/10\r\nEnjoyment: Incredibly fun , however it hits you with a brick sometimes. 10/10\r\nArt: Kyoto Animation did some amazingly good art but I found theeyes to be an incomplete work , near to the depth of newer KyoAni works but not quite there. The backgrounds are very well done and so is the scenery. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters are all very well rounded and just about all of the main characters receive back story and arcs for them. These characters are easy to fall in love with and I found it to be a major plus to the series. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSounds: Pretty much this has amazing sound. It works for the settings 99% of the time and is one of the most lovely soundtracks I\u2019ve ever heard in an anime. OP and ED are great, and the characters are voiced wonderfully \u2026 well in Japanese at least I never gave the English dialogue a chance. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is one of the best anime I have ever watched. 10/10\\n",

            "content": "Promise is your trust and your relationship with a person, it centers your own sense of devotion to your word and to your recipient. However promises tend to backslide because of the amount of pressure and demand that is settled on someone when they are bound by their own word. This concept alone is the reason why I consider \"kanon (2006)\" prodigious.Once again I will say that I rated this anime 10/10 which solely based on my own enjoyment, most of the time my enjoyment does not reflect on how good an anime is, but this one did, surprisingly. That aside Lets get started.\r\nStory 10/10:\r\nAsI said earlier, I consider this anime prodigious just because of its original concept,promise, most of the time shows with this concept tend to fall off because of its predictability in its outcome and its loss of something \"original\".\\n\r\nThe story is slow paced, but this slow pace is exactly the reason why its viewers continue to watch from one episode to another. What I love most is the atmosphere of mystery in the whole story, its characters, the histories and the \"truth\", I can also say that its story  is VERY emotional. The only thing that throws of the story is the fact that after each arc(around 5-6 episodes per arc) the girls tend to be somewhat forgotten,but they still appear in flashback of the main protagonist, that aside I still rate its story 10/10 because it added something \"original\" to the concept of promise in shows.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10:\\n\\n\r\nI have to admit, even though this anime was released back in 2006 the art is quite impressive, every single detail is well made from something major, the characters, the setting, to the minor stuff like the background, before and after flashbacks and the exact weather( honestly who the hell gives detail to rain. snow, and even falling leaves during fall).\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10:\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is stunning, it was able to set the proper mood in every moment be it a sad one or a happy one and even an adrenaline rush moment. The sound in my opinion will really make you emotional.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10:\\n\\n\r\nCharacters is what differentiates a bad anime from a good one, this alone states that the characters for this show are awesome. The protagonist is not your average \" what am I supposed to do?\" , \" why are all these things happening?\", he tends to become unresponsive to the things around him but sooner or later (after deep realization of what's happening)he always comes up with  a way to find things out, and whats more he was able to solve all these with the skill deduction and common sense, which by the way most protagonist lack( no offense). The girls were also remarkable they all had their  mysteries about them, their developments and their ups and downs.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall 10/10:\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime because of its originality, to be quite honest this anime was able to make me feel emotional and even sad, at the same time its was able to make me laugh and even puzzled. It was also amazing that they ( the writers) had the knowledge to make a protagonist that had the skills of deduction in terms of  \"solving the riddle\" and common sense. Overall I recommend this anime to people who would like to try something different or maybe people who like to take an emotional ride. Well that's the end of my review if you have any criticism feel free to comment me or pm me. Good night and Enjoy!!!",

I couldnt find almost anything wrong with it, it flowed very well. Along with the art and sound it just made it better. The characters were pretty well done. It starts off with a non-hooking first episode. Its kinda wierd, it didnt have anything besides the main character Yuicchi, going to his cousins house. Its like if i didnt hear anything good about it, and watched the first episode i probably wouldnt continue. But if your going tostart it, continue, really this anime was amazing. Some people may disagree or agree with me on the first episode. But i really sat there like soooo whats happening?\\n\\n\r\nI would suggest to almost anyone besides those Shonen Straight out action guys whos favorites are Naruto, One Piece, and Dragon Ball Z. \\n\\n\r\nHave fun watching!",

            "content": "In a city called Amnesia. Wait, sorry, that\u2019s not it. In a city where the main character has terrible amnesia, everyone is prone to sickness and accident, and echoes of better things to come echo resoundingly (namely, Clannad), there\u2019s a guy named Yuuichi. He\u2019s moved in with his aunt, as he did seven years previously. His memories of that winter break are really hazy, borderline Elfen Lied syndrome. But he met a lot of people and affected a lot of lives in that break, and his return is the culmination of what he started seven years before. This is set off by the perky andcute Ayu, a girl he knows, but doesn\u2019t know. This continues with a chance meeting with a mischievous girl named Makoto and continues from there.\\n\\n\r\nKanon has the same set up as Clannad in that Yuuichi meets a host of girls who have some problems that he attempts to quell. The romantic interest is hard to guess because he seems so close to so many girls, but in the end there is one constant girl who he winds up with. A lot of the same elements as Clannad come up as well, especially prevalent being the supernatural aspect and the coma. Of course, this is the precursor to Clannad and should be treated as such now that we can look back at it. While it has a lot of failings, it is the start.\\n\\n\r\nKanon\u2019s story isn\u2019t great, but it\u2019s not bad. The problem with the story is how forced the depressing parts seem. I don\u2019t  know how many times the series tries to make me feel bad for characters by having their parents or themselves come down with unnamed diseases. The first time it was boring and cheap, the fourth time it was stupid. The series doesn\u2019t leave many characters without scarring and while I can commend it for having balls, I can\u2019t commend it for continually forcing me to watch scene after scene of shocked and sad characters after finding out their friends or family have been hurt or come down with disease. There are certain points where you will have a shocked expression sitting on your face because a  bad thing has come out of left field. though, and these are the most effective.\\n\\n\r\nMakoto, Mai, and Shiori\u2019s sections of the story are all decently done, but none of it really stands out. The gradual progression of the disappearance of Makoto is nicely done and may be the only subtle part of the series. You know what\u2019s going to happen, and you feel for Makoto. Mai is different in the fact that none of what she does is really dramatic, I felt like I was watching a supernatural high school action anime instead of a drama. The part about her mother was groan-worthy, especially because it was the second sickness in the series. The drama came more so at the end of this storyline, and was fairly stupid in my opinion. Shiori\u2019s section, for me, was pretty archetypical and boring. It made nice progress character development-wise, but was otherwise nothing exciting and brought up the fourth instance of sickness (the third being Aunt Akiko). And then more happens to Aunt Akiko and this was one of the few moments I was left with my jaw dropped. As I said, it came out of nowhere and it hurt pretty bad.\\n\\n\r\nWhere the story is good is with the final section, dedicated to Ayu. As I watched it, I felt like I was watching Tomoya and Fuko from Clannad getting together. I was seeing characters I already know. And I was so happy too. I knew what was coming, but it was still emotionally riveting and dramatic to watch this storyline unfold, and an especially happy moment at the end. I felt that the romance between Ayu and Yuuichi was a little rushed, and he didn\u2019t seem as into her as he did Shiori or the other girls, but nonetheless it was still heartfelt.\\n\\n\r\nThe series as a whole can be considered forced drama, but there are moments that are seriously heartfelt and well done. And a lot of the good drama comes from the excellent cast of characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are really moe, but that\u2019s okay. The personalities are all different, and while some are archetypical, some are a little different. Each character develops and grows on you, even Yuuichi, which I find commendable. Usually the main male character is someone you could give a crap less about, a piece of cardboard being thrown around and rejecting any advances while simultaneously being an asshole to everyone he meets. Yuuichi is the opposite. While he is a snarky and sarcastic guy, he is, at heart, good. He does everything he can to help these girls and the fact that he cries over one of them just goes to show how different he is from the rest. He knows the right way to deal with everything, and while his seeming amnesia is a nuisance (though part of that is explained later on) he\u2019s overall the best character in the entire show.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and Jun is Sunohara.\\n\\n\r\nWhy bring all this stuff about Clannad up? Because if you liked Clannad, you\u2019ll love Kanon. If you loved Kanon, you\u2019ll love Clannad. There are a lot of similarities, especially in the style of how the show progresses, but both provide great drama and great characters.\\n\\n\r\nIn Kanon there\u2019s only that one problem of forced drama, though; the fact that bad things are prone to happen to everyone. And while the happy ending is nice, you spend the entire show feeling like you\u2019re being made to cry or feel bad. As stated, there are points where things work and painful scenes are painful, there are points where it\u2019s boring as hell.\\n\\n\r\nDespite all the issues, it\u2019s still a thoroughly enjoyable anime. I laughed, I cried, I met new friends and found myself meeting old ones in different bodies. Never is it bad, it just never hits the stride that Clannad eventually will.\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re looking for drama and characters you\u2019ll grow to love, then give Kanon a shot.",

But anyways; he forms a romance with 5 girls through the anime. The romance however was pretty decent. They could had done more work on the character development on the romantic side of things. But love isn't the only thing about this anime. The main story is; when Yuuichi travels back to I think his home town, he re-unites with his childhood friends. But for some reason, Yuuichi doesn't remember any of them, nor the layoutof the town it self. And minor spoiler alert, all 5 of those girls are his childhood friends. \\n\\n\r\nAnd now that we have discussed a small run-down of the story, we are now moving on to my least favorite part of this anime. And that's the drama. Now since I liked Clannad, I was kinda expecting it to be kinda like that, and it is, but THEY MILKED IT WAY TOO MUCH! I'm not gonna tell you what happens, but you'll understand for yourself. I found  this anime to be very clich\u00e9, and easily predictable. And because of that, I am giving this anime an 8 out of 10, because that really did kill the experience for me.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nNow this isn't a bad anime. I actually found it to be very good, but that drama was milked a little too much. But this anime is defintly worth a watch; if you're a fan of the romantic drama genre. Me? I'm more of a fan of romantic comedy's, so you might enjoy this anime more if you love drama. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 8 out of 10 [Very Good].",

But Aizawa Yuuichi has a bad memory so he forgot a lot of things that were happened seven years ago and tried to remind of them gradually. Since the anime is remade from the visual novel with the same name, Aizawa Yuuichi-san will have different storied with different girls. And I think these characters are similar:\r\n  * Tsukimiya Ayu \u2248 Ibuki Fuko\r\n  * Minase Akio \u2248 Sanae Furukawa\r\n  *Kitagawa Jun \u2248 Sunohara Youhei\\n\\n\r\nMy favourate character is Tsukimiya Ayu, because she is a kawaii loli desu, just like Ibuki Fuko in CLANNAD. She regards taiyaki as her favourate food and Ibuki Fuko in CLANNAD regards starfish as her favourate things.\\n\\n\r\nMy second favourate character is Sawatari Makoto, who is kawaii too and says kawaii \"Auu~\" from time to time.

The asshole with the heart of gold, the potential harem situation, the \u2018one best friend\u2019 guy, the inexplicable deaths and suffering, and more suffering. All that good stuff.\r\nKanon is chock full of weird and wonderful characters, and as long as you don\u2019t mind the gender imbalance (about 10:2), then there\u2019s something for everyone.\r\nYuuichi Aizawa moves backto a town he used to stay in for the winter, and immediately becomes reacquainted with some old friends he\u2019d completely forgotten about. Huh. Weird.\\n\\n\r\nHis aunt and cousin keep prodding his memory, to see if any synapses fire, but it seems poor Yuuichi is a complete amnesiac about the whole situation. The show does a very good job at keeping you suspicious about this, until it sideswipes you completely by having several characters sustain horrific accidents, with little to no warning sometimes. However, all the time you\u2019ve invested in getting to know the characters isn\u2019t a waste, because once Yuuichi gets his memory back, and finds out why he left in the first place, the granddaddy of Deus Ex Machinas happens, and everyone miraculously recovers!\\n\\n\r\n...so yeah, a less than ideal finish. But don\u2019t let that put you off watching it. It has some brilliant humour, a solid storyline (sans the above), and a really likeable bunch of characters. It\u2019s not their best, but it was certainly a good starting point. After all, with future references and cameos, you could say it was Kanon by name, Canon by nature.",

The intro, BGM and just the characters in general are all great. While the beginning is a little slow to start in my opinion, it has a few funny scenes to help out during that time. Then, when the good part starts. Things get serious and it becomes a series that literally had me in tears. This show literally made me looking for anime like this or even better than this, when it first aired. I was now exploringand holding other shows to this standard or higher because it was one of the first anime I had watched that gave me so much emotion in it. So, should you watch this? Yes, you will not regret it when you complete this series.",

            "content": "Kanon, like the Pachelbel composition that supplied its name, flows gently and warmly, a tender tugging of heartstrings possessing fathomless depth of heart.  It is quiescent and bittersweet, nearly as despairing as comforting, its direction instantly recognizable to most but no less capable of sweeping the audience along in its wake.\r\nBeset by tragedy, framed by the cruel iniquities of life and the merciful concessions of a magical world, Kanon trudges on, resolute and passionate.  These Key visual novel-based series have reputations for being \u201cfeel factories\u201d \u2013 shamelessly melodramatic, exploitative of characters\u2019 plight for the sake of provoking reactions from the audience \u2013 andsuch a judgment would not be unjustified, but perhaps premature in regard to Kanon.  The characters do suffer, both outwardly and inwardly, due to random misfortune, each other, and themselves; no tale can be told without some of the players enduring hardship for the telling.  Kanon is not cruel.  It employs coincidence and callbacks, but rarely contrivance; perhaps some of the situations are unrelatable, at least in literal aspect, but the show never reaches such a fantastical mood that it becomes the dire, farcical tear-jerker it is sometimes painted as.  \\n\\n\r\nThe obvious appeal of Kanon is the timeworn conceit of one amiable, inoffensive male lead whiling away the episodes with a variety pack of cute girls, but the show is packed with aesthetic detail that opens a much different angle of attraction, and one unique to Kanon.  Nestled in a snow-capped country town where time seems to bear little urgency and every day brings with it endless opportunities, Kanon begins as a relaxing, easygoing show, a gorgeously consumable work of classic moe.  The dreamlike environs slowly fade into color with a distant voice-over from Ayu, who opens many episodes with a sad, nostalgic observation to herself.  Pillowed drifts blanket the scenery, illuminated by the soft light of streetlights and sunset; the color palette, while not dull, is hardly striking, favoring basic, strong, wholesome hues.  The girls speak in soft, airy voices, each one of them equipped with their own adorable catchphrase.  Their character designs, though perhaps somewhat out of fashion now with their feathery hair and gigantic eyes, are stylish and appealing, both incredibly sharp in comparison to the 2002 anime and mellow enough to live up to the moe aesthetic.  The mood is calm, the temperament warm and reassuring, like a hearty fire in the midst of a roaring winter.  Most of the time, nobody even makes any sudden movements.  Enriched by strings and chimes from the heart-wrenching OP to the catchy ED, Kanon\u2019s soundtrack perfectly embodies and enhances the show like few other soundtracks (smart move borrowing so heavily from the source material there).  More than anything else, Kanon is calm and soothing, a wintry wonderland straight out of a fairy tale that cannot be extricated from its pure, snowy trappings.\\n\\n\r\nIt would not take long for any viewer to ascertain whether or not they have the wherewithal to sit through 24 episodes of a Kanon-like show, and Kanon is nothing if not a genre show in that it fully relies on the audience buying into the premise and aesthetic in order to go anywhere.  In that sense, Kanon may be nothing greater than an excellent example of its genre, proof that nothing in this world can defeat Kyoto Animation when it sets out to make a cute show.  As such a work, however, Kanon is exquisite.  The girls\u2019 arcs (routes, in a former life) are sometimes clich\u00e9, sometimes unexpected, but always delivered with enough attention to audio/visual landscapes and natural performances to inspire every last iota of narrative.  As the show progresses, of course, the drama heightens and circumstances take marked turns for the worse (a famously emotional work like this can\u2019t remain sunny and innocuous forever, after all), but somehow, in the midst of the suffering that plagues the characters, Kanon never loses its grip on its enveloping atmosphere.  The show isn\u2019t wanton in its destruction, nor does it hold the viewer\u2019s hand so much that the misfortunes lose their impact and urgency; Kanon walks the line between. \\n\\n\r\nWhen criticism must be voiced, it may be levied at the usual suspects: the protagonist, Yuuichi, who is sensitive, good-humored, and attractive in that barely-descript way that only the male leads in these romantic schemes can muster; the format, which has been revisited so often that its hackneyed conceit barely warrants comment; the ability of the show to move from one relationship to another without seeming to lose steam or dwell on the past; etc.  For myself, these complaints held little weight, as I, in accordance with my previous descriptions, set as much stock in the show\u2019s atmosphere as in its narrative, but nonetheless found the narrative highly compelling and became invested in each arc even though the \u201ctrue route\u201d is obvious.  The characters are easy to love and easy to cheer for.\\n\\n\r\nKanon is flushed with spirit and earnestness, and whether or not the concept is tiresome has no bearing on this show\u2019s execution of it; Kanon is competent and well-designed, but more than that, heartwarming and lovely.\\n",

            "content": "This is one of my favorite anime series of all time. I will always hold this series dear, for it is beautiful. Forgive me if I sound overly emotional and cheesy, but I really love Kanon 2006. Everything about it is amazing.\r\nStory: 9\r\nThe story in Kanon starts off simple at first, then becomes much more complex as the story progresses. It starts off with Yuichi Aizawa, who returns to his hometown where he spent his childhood. He moves in with his cousin Nayuki Minase, and as he befriends some of the people in the town, he starts to remember some of his suppressed memories ofhis childhood, which cause lots of drama and tear-jerking scenes to follow. Really, the stories were all developed amazingly, save for Nayuki's. I won't spoil any of it, but I do feel that Nayuki's arc wasn't focused on as much as the others, which is a shame since it is one of my favorites. However, besides that, every other story was unique and touching, and I even cried at points.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nThe art is great, and the animation is one of the best I have seen, even more so than the animation in some of the anime series of now. Some find the facial proportions of most of the female characters to be strange, considering how big the eyes are and the mouth placement and all that, but honestly, I didn't really see much wrong with that. I thought the art was cute. Plus, the backgrounds are super detailed and very realistic.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nThe voice acting is phenomenal, and the music (all of the music) is superb, as expected from Key and Kyoto Animation. Each voice actor/actress puts their all in each character, and they are all very emotional and passionate. The music sets the atmosphere for the scenes flawlessly. The opening and ending songs are wonderful, also.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nEach character is developed fully, and even the male protagonist's character is developed a lot. Unlike lots of male leads in harem series, Yuichi has personality and charm. Although some of the girls admittedly fell under some of the harem personality stereotypes, this wasn't too much of a problem.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nThis anime, in my opinion, was very enjoyable. The funny moments made me laugh, and the sad moments made me emotional, and even made me shed tears. I felt attached to all of the characters. Every factor mentioned in this review contributes greatly to the enjoyment of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nI have a tender spot for this anime, for it is one of the few that has really made me feel a vast series of emotions. The ending made me feel happy, and I love every character and, well, everything about this series. Every time I watch it, I still feel the same emotions as I did when I first viewed it. There is a vast amount of good anime, but few anime series are this astounding.",

            "content": "Memories are a mysterious thing\u2026 when you remember something, you are positive that what you remember is true, but memories can play tricks on you. Sometime the mind chooses what it wants to remember, and disregards what might be a painful or sad event. Memories are like a canon. A canon is a simple melody played repeatedly and after each line, a new melody is played on top of the existing melody, until it grows more complex. This (admittedly complicated) analogy ties very neatly into Kanon.\r\nAnother fantastic Key anime, Kanon is all about vague memories, and discovering how different memories tie together. I will notgo into plot points, save that it begins with the main character, Yuuichi, transferring to a small town to live with his Aunt Akiko, and cousin Nayuki. He meets a number of eccentric characters as the days go by, such as Ayu, a rambunctious squirt who is never without a cry of \u201cuguu,\u201d Shiori, a quiet, beautiful mystery of a girl, Asuka Lan- oh sorry, I mean Makoto, the loud one with a soft side, aka tsundere, and Mai and Sayuri, two seniors with a strong connection. Suffice it to say, Yuuichi gets close to each one of these girls, and makes for a very deep story. \\n\\n\r\nThis will not be a long review, but to start, I have never been this attached to any shows characters as much as in Kanon. I cried during this show more times than I care to admit, particularly during one tear-jerking scene in ep 9. In addition, during the last 3 eps, I think I had tears in my eyes the entire time, but thankfully they changed to tears of joy at the end. It\u2019s rare to see an anime this well put together, and able to make you care about its characters this deeply. I particularly love the use of Pachabel\u2019s Canon in D, throughout the show, as well as \u201cOnce Upon a Dream\u201d from Sleeping Beauty during a certain scene. As far as I know, that\u2019s what that song is from\u2026 if anyone cares to correct me on that fact, go right ahead. If I had to complain about anything, it would be Yuuichi\u2019s school chum, Jun. In my opinion, he only exists to break the mood of the show, except for one hilarious scene with Yuuichi. Other than Jun, I have no real complaints about this show. I only have praise for its characters and its story development, and its powerful emotion that it carries. It comes strongly recommended from me. \\n",

            "content": "A quick review of my favourite anime of all time (so far). My first written review!!! AHHHH!!!\r\nStory:\r\nThe story is not your typical harem as people might make it about to be whenever they see the word 'harem'. It plays out like a slice-of-life comedy in the beginning which may seem like a harem to most people, but the jokes are not as O.T.T as other harems in the past. Though with that, people might be incredibly bored throughout because all they are seeing is a slice-of-life comedy, nothing is progessively changing with the exception of the character interactions, which are very entertaining. Then it takesa cleverly thought out tonal and atmosphere change around the near halfway point and transforms into a deep and emotional journey and experience. This helps it's once bored audience to be one the edge of their seats and to be invested in what is happening to our beloved characters. But the story is just a catalyst to the real heart of the anime, but I'll get to that later. It's also worth noting that the story is very well written. Easily one of the best anime screenplays I've seen. As the dialogue is witty and natural. There is also a lot of subtext and undertones.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nKanon is one of Kyoto Animations finest works. It is simply wonderful. The character designs are moe granted, but the character animation is very fluent and the designs are at least consistent. The backgrounds are one of the best I've ever seen on how it's so detailed on how they draw snow. The lighting successfully compliments the atmosphere of the show, exposing us to daytime to afternoon to moonlight. In short, the art is phenomenal.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI watched this series in dub rather than in sub because watching animes in English is just how I prefer it. Anyway, the dub is  one of the more bearable dubs I've watched despite having our characters looking so adorable. Many people have been complaining that the dub doesn't even try to attempt at being cute and incorperating moe, but I don't think that they were intending to have moe into the dub and that for me works better because you don't want to have cute girls to hinder your enjoyment of the show or overshadow the characters personalities and traits. The performances in the dub are well acomplished beacuse they actually have the emotions right off the bat. And they overall fit the characters, yes that goes for Ayu as well!\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is not only my favourite anime soundtracks, but one of my favourite soundtracks, period. I just adore it. While the kind of tracks they have might not be the most original thing out there, they are well worth remembering after a YEAR first watching it. The tracks consist of a full orchestra. It mainly consist of canons which are pieces of music are on loop, but have a definitive ending and leaves you with a different feeling each time. The happier music has the piano,drum beats, wind and if you listen closely you can hear a synthesizer. But for the emotional scenes you have full on strings and a piano, they are just a beautiful sound and are they ones I remember the most, but I do appreciate the happier tunes too. It is a very clever score and unmistakeably beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nBut the real heart of the show lies in the characters. The cast is literally what made the show for me. They have so many varying personalty traits that it feels like that you're not seeing the same character twice. Another thing that is so great about them is that they have so much mystery to their character, going back to the story serving as a catalyst and having all this mystery pile up on each other makes up for some of the best moments of the series as you're constantly figuring out to find out the secrets of the girls. Speaking of which, while the girls maybe cute, they are constantly being put in situations that real life people unfortunately face, which on paper may sound very much melodramatic as it can possibly can be, but these characters are so distinctivly human that it pays off. It also shows that Yuichi shares genuine chemistry with the girls, well that is mainly due to the fact that he met most of the girls seven years prior.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThis series was enjoyable from beginning to end always successfully getting a reaction out of me. This may seem like a cute show at first but it evolves into something unimaginable, like a dream, which is coincidentally one of things the series talks about! While a happy and inspirational show, it was also a tragically sad and realistic story with supernatural elements involved. And some of the moments are so depressing, it's easily one of the saddest piece of media I've ever seen and one of the few to actually make me cry to something that isn't animal related. I would love to talk about these moments, what effect they had on me and the ending, but it would just ruin it for you. Kanon is something that should be seen to believe, because not only is it my favourite anime of all time, it's the anime that actually change my life, make new friends, made me a better person and was the anime to make me an otaku and to believe that without anime I would've been lost in this world, but I still but family, friends and school first!\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nKanon (2006) is not only a brilliant anime, but brilliant television. It's just wonderful. The story and its characters are well written and deeply developed, the animation is brillant and the music is beautiful. It is definitely a 'diamond-in-the-rough' in the harem genre, but also an experience. I would definitely recommend it to anyone because I believe it is the most realistic drama I've ever seen. It's my favourite of the three Key visual novels to anime adaptations and would be my favourite anime for quite a long time. Just go watch it now while you still can!\\n\\n\r\nTo see more reviews from me, check out IrishAnimefan on YouTube. Sl\u00e1n.",

            "content": "Kanon 2006 has a lot of emotions in it. How shall I describe it? An anime of many miracles... cute, funny, sad, its a relationship builder. Yes, I think that's a great way for describing it, a relationship builder. A boy who makes many friends while staying with his aunt, as a child. And then completely forgetting them, only to become friends with them all over again seven years later. Theres a very little bit of action, not much. And not every moment made sense until the end of the anime.\r\nI think it surprised me how real the characters made the anime feel. I reallydid get lost inside that world somehow. To regain his memory, Yuuichi had to go through a lot of trials, he had to lose and regain them to realize their importance. To me this anime had a sweet and yet tragic taste. A never ending dream, and yet at the same time, reality. I think this anime deserves its rating of nine because it really did keep me glued to my seat this time around. \\n\\n\r\nBut I really should be honest; it took me three tries to get through this anime. Okay, so I started watching Kanon (2006) a few years back. I couldn't decide if I wanted to watch it in English or Japanese at the time. So I tried watching the first episode in japanese but out of curiosity I started it over and swiched to english. Normally I'd be fine just watching an anime in japanese with subs, but after hearing the voices in english it sort of just stuck. I decided to watch it in english because after making it through the first episode I realized that most of the voice actors I had grown up listening to.\\n\\n\r\nAt that time I only got to about episode 7 or 8 before I moved on to watch something else. I decided I'd watch it some other time. Finally this year I started watching it from the beginning again. And before I knew it I was far beyond where I stopped the first time. I was able to finish all 24 episodes in about 4 days, that's how much I enjoyed it.",

            "content": "Ok now this is a very difficult anime to review, mainly because, well, it\u2019s not really an anime everyone talks about even if you've seen it. But here goes.\r\nStory - The story is fairly simple going and has a new \"main\" (I use the word main loosely here) plot every 5 or so episodes because they slowly introduce new characters and their problems until the big finally which I can guarantee not a single one of you will see coming, but its great no matter how you look at it. For the vast majority of the episodes it serious with a load of comedy thrownin and even if you see it coming it\u2019s still one of the funniest things you'll see. But it does have its serious side, like the death of a character and romance between friends and the first plot you're given is the main character trying to regain his memories of this town from when he was young.\\n\\n\r\nArt - well the art in this I basic the only bit that really stands out is the \"demons\" that we see latter in the series and to be totally honest their not all that special either but don\u2019t get me wrong the animation is good but it just doesn\u2019t stand out.\\n\\n\r\nSound - now this is basically the same as the art, nothing really stands out, and the only real praise I can give the sound is there are some really good voice actors used and an interesting catchphrase for one of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - well in Kanon (2006) there\u2019s a character for everyone there\u2019s your moe there\u2019s your clown, the hopeless one, the sporty one I think there literally is a character for everyone and everyone will love little Ayu-Ayu.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall - this is an anime that is you don\u2019t see it you're missing out big time, heck, every time I\u2019ve been to a convention (most recently Wai-con 09) somehow I always end up talking to at least one person (who I meet there) about Kanon (2006) and how good it is and how everyone should see it, so be there or be square!\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n{{Please feel free to message me to tell me how I can/could improve my reviews to make them more helpful.}}\\n",

            "content": "Kanon may not be the best anime I've watched, but it's still an anime worth watching. \r\n  Production wise, I think they did a fine job here. The animation is pretty gorgeous to look at. The crisp backgrounds and design of the characters make the tone really stand out. Combine that with the stellar sound, and it stands out even more. The soundtrack, meanwhile, matches perfectly with every scene being presented. Its use of Piano and strings creates a rather vivid feeling for the setting as well. The acting was done rather well, they were able to voice the characters fluently withoutproblems.\\n\\n\r\n  The story however, although not bad, wasn't all that perfect. Its flaws are mostly is attributed to the characters of the show. Now, they're not bad, in fact I rather liked the majority of them. At their best, they were funny and interesting. The interactions they have, although a bit unnatural at times, still felt rather genuine in others. At their worst, however, they tend to be bland, confusing, and forgettable. There are some characters that get thrown under the rug once their role was done. It made their existence rather meaningless since they were only shown for exposition or to create unneeded tension. \\n\\n\r\n  The bright side though, the story itself was able to hold its own as it went by, for the most part. The mixture of real and supernatural elements was done well here. It's relevance to both the setting and characters was the concept's greatest strength. The show's other strength lies with its tone, being able to tie in humor and drama perfectly without them interfering with one another. Even though the drama can be forced in some parts, it's few and far between.\\n\\n\r\n  Overall, I really enjoyed this anime. Although not perfect, the story and characters were really well written. The production value was what made it better. So, I recommend you check it out when you can.",

            "content": "It takes a lot of talent to make a pure slice of life interesting. In order for it to have a unique feeling, the characters and their interactions have to be compelling, while the dialogues need something to keep us wanting more; that's the trickiest part, it can be done in multiple ways but is at the same time hard to get right. The conversations can be humorous, dramatic or just intelligent but they have to offer something to the audience. Does Kanon (from this point on I'm going to refer to it by title only, I always mean the 2006 version) capture manage topull this off?\\n\r\nIn my opinion, it doesn't. Luckily, it really isn't a slice of life.\\n\\n\r\nAdmittedly, in the beginning it is, which is exactly why I find the first 6 or 7 episodes to be rather underwhelming. I get that there are several characters that must be developed and there are events to build up to but there's far too much padding and mindless cute banter for me not to fall asleep. The same could be accomplished in two or three episodes with little missing. It is a prime example of what many people think when they think \"slice of life\": it's cutesy, pretty stupid and annoying. This part I didn't like, even if I do understand the writers needing it to set up mysteries and introduce us to the cast. It didn't help that half of the plot relies on amnesia, which befalls like three out of six main characters; the anime was even honest to enough to straight up comment on that.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the rest of Kanon is by no means like that. It gets dramatic quickly and never drops the ball, resulting in a complete and touching story. Even though the series is arc-based, the parts are tightly connected and almost all come down to the lead's past, which is the main intrigue, as expected with amnesia as a main plot device. One of the arcs doesn't, really, it seems to be an issue the writers just wanted to comment on, possibly a tribute. It could be written out easily but is still identifiable and intense enough, so I didn't mind it. Speaking of amnesia, surprisingly there are good explanations for each character having it, not just for the sake of moving the plot, like this plot device is often utilized. Kudos to the writers on that one. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, the anime is very well-written once the story actually gets going. So much so that, while with 3 out of 5 main girls magic is directly involved in their subplots, there is never too much of it, just enough to justify the situation. It is used only as a means to make all this possible, and there is no explanation whatsoever but it is kept promptly out of focus and doesn't feel as a cheap writer's tool, just as a starting point for the plot. It's done in a pretty clever fashion, for example, at one point the show features a demon fighter, and, although the entities are real, they are invisible, so they feel more as a symbol of a threat than actual demonic beings. There is a surprising amount of symbolism later on, practically on the subject of dreams and acceptance, all well-handled. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are, in fact, not all that important here. The lead, Yuuichi, is a pretty boring \"good guy\", even though he has an interesting past. Most of the girls he interacts with don't have that much of a personality either, just a trait or two to make them stand out. Some are pretty unique, especially Mai; Shiori's case has been seen countless times but is interesting because of the angle they have decided to take. Others are mostly your typical \"cute anime girls\". The only thing that's important about them and what makes them so different is their relation to Yuuichi's past. So, we have a unique case here: a slice of life which, in fact, isn't character-driven. Which is why it doesn't work that well in the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nThe art certainly doesn't help the characters stand out. Kyoto Animation is often criticized for making everyone look the same, and while I normally don't agree (say what you want about Haruhi but it's definitely not the case there), it is sadly true here. All the female characters look the same; the only two things that differ are hair and eye color. I'm also not a big fan of the eyes that take up half the face. So, the job of making the characters memorable falls on the voice actors, who, thankfully, were up to the task. With this kind of animation, they are responsible for conveying the personalities, and they do a good job. None sound generic, I never had trouble telling one voice from the other.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'd say Kanon has a great and compelling story, everyone's problems seem surprisingly real despite supernatural constantly being mentioned. The characters, if generic, are identifiable, partially because they fall under the \"Every man\" category because of it. For me, the show was held back by its slow start and art style but I still enjoyed the hell out of it. Easily an eight out of ten, nine if you don't mind this kind of animation.",

The story started out with the main character slowly gaining pieces of his memory back. Most of the people he met were connected to his childhood. The story was pretty much interesting.\r\nThe art for me took a little time to get used to, it has been awhile since I've watched an anime where the females have way bigger eyes than the males, but it was really no big deal, the art was pretty good.\r\nThe sound was amazing. The opening theme was very good and verycalming.\\n\r\nThe characters are all lovable. There isn't a single character you will dislike. They have unique quality. The makers did a good job at giving characters in an anime that aren't the same as other anime.\\n\r\nOverall I really did enjoy this anime, it was really one of my favorites. I wasn't really expecting much from the main picture but it goes to show not to judge a book by it's cover. There are a lot of twists and turns that may leave you speechless. Also if you are someone who liked Clannad than you will love this, its pretty much the same feeling to it. This is recommended for people looking for Drama, Comedy with a touch of Romance and Supernatural.",

            "content": "Part two of the Key/KyoAni collaborated trilogy continues their moe fan service that drives many male otaku insane for some reason and the emotional rollercoaster anime, only this time there is a few changes from the last series. For one, it\u2019s longer than 12 episodes and while it may not be as different from the other Key/KyoAni shows, it\u2019s\u2026\u2026something that going to be explained once we get into the review.\r\nTeen-aged Yuichi used to visit his aunt and cousin Nayuki all the time as a kid, but it has been seven years and his memory of that time has faded. Now he has come to livewith them to finish out his high school career beginning with the winter semester, and winds up in his cousin's class. During his first few days in town he (literally) runs into Ayu, a small girl with a winged backpack that, after some prompting, he eventually remembers he used to know, and starts hanging out with her. An encounter with an amnesiac girl named Makoto, who can only remember that she has a grudge against Yuichi, results in Makoto coming to live at his aunt's house, and he also meets an assortment of other girls, including Nayuki's friend and classmate Kaori, the mysteriously truant Shiori, and upperclassmen Sayuri and Mai. As pleasant as things are, though, mysteries abound. What happened to Makoto's memory? Why can't he remember more? And what other secrets lurk in this town?\\n\\n\r\nOK, I got to know, most of the time so many things happen in this show with so many storylines, often end quickly (very quickly) or get back seated until the end of the series but other than that, there was a change of pace in this type of show. Usually, one of the female characters suffer from amnesia, not knowing their past and it gets retreaded throughout but this time, the main male character Yuichi is the one to have that. I don\u2019t know what other Key/KyoAni show does that but it\u2019s something fresh. It also has that formula to really make you either sad or it wants you to cry (very hard) when you hear the side stories of someone that got sick from\u2026\u2026..well, something (They will never mention what sickness they got. Possibly the convenience sickness) and/or some other very tragic heartbreaking story and most of the time, I was immersed in some of those parts but mostly the lighter side of the anime; the antics that makes it seem less overly dramatic but genuinely funny.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of being genuinely funny, the main character Yuichi is actually one of my favorite characters on the show; he\u2019s the type of guy that can work his sarcasm in being funny without trying to, can be jokey without being a douchebag, and also someone I gave a damn about, but unfortunately I can say the less for the female characters or the half-harem section of the characters. They aren\u2019t very strong character types with the standards of it being the sweet one, sickly one, H.M.G.I.C. (Head Moe Girl in Charge), tsundere, etc. it\u2019s your basic anime traits in female characters just like in the last entry, only they\u2019re slightly noticeable.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is a better effort from Kyoto Animation here than in Air, as it did felt livelier and very vibrant. The character designs are still the same as their other Key efforts with the big-eyed moe girls and the older characters looking the same age as the girls and even the main girl Ayu appears to be a small child but she\u2019s actually 17. Yeah, I\u2019ll say they don\u2019t want to age their characters when they should have. The music is pure Key signature, meaning that it does sound like it\u2019s from a visual novel and yes, I know this is based on a visual novel but I wish it didn\u2019t always sound like that. I thought of the opening theme as soft and quiet building up every time it plays and it matches the tone of the show to a tee.\\n\\n\r\nI watched the English dub of this by ADV Films (although FUNimation took over N.A. distribution rights) and while people say that it isn\u2019t very moe like the Japanese version, it\u2019s actually subjective to say that. I would\u2019ve been annoyed if I watched it in the Japanese as I\u2019m glad that the English dub didn\u2019t try to go that route (plus, the actresses did sound annoyingly cute in their own way). Noted performances include Chris Patton as Yuichi, a relatively then-unknown Britney Karbowski as Ayu, and Jessica Boone as Nayuki.\\n\\n\r\nFINAL VERDICT: Honestly, after watching this, I prefer this show to Air in terms of them being actually longer so the story didn\u2019t go too fast, but I did felt like I gotten lost watching some of the episodes in plot and the sappiness and sadness were played in for dramatics. Like Air, I would say you should stream before you even think of buying the show.\\n",

Although I think this show has some great humor the arc it's progressing through really seems poor and much of what goes on I find very annoying.  Although I like most of the characters, mikoto is one that I went from accepting as a normal addition to pissing me off.  I really don't think the show connects well between it's supernatural element and the reaction of it's characters.  Now, that's kinda hard to put out since I can't really force howsomeone would react to the supernatural, but even in a genre that deals with escape from reality, this show is quite aggravating in a way I don't usually have to deal with.  I guess if you're gonna watch the show, it's not going to be something really special, and you kinda have to be someone who watches it just to pass the time.  It's not really engaging or interesting enough for me, and I was pretty disappointed by being led here from clannad.",

            "content": "A very touching anime which is put together magnificently whether it be the way that each of the characters are developed or each of the unique stories which the characters hold.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nThis story like many other key titles tends to send your heart on a journey in which some moments you will be left laughing and at other times to the point where tears start to roll down your face.\r\nIt splits each girl's story into arc's in which Yuichi has to help them tackle the problem that they face. This may seem like a simple and quite cliche'd concept but  they conduct it beautifullyto make you feel as if you were there, so when they want you to be sad you will and when they want you to be happy you will as well.  Each girls story don't feel similar and each one unravels in a different way which keeps the anime refreshing. However like I find in a lot of key anime's, they tend to discard characters once there arc is done.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nWhat can I say about the art of Kanon? Well it is gorgeous with a varieties of colors which are used well to set the mood of what's happening currently in the anime. The characters are all well designed and although they may not appeal to all I personally liked the way in which they were designed. Although it was quite reminiscent of some other key titles.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI find that sound in these types of anime is always very important to the way in which you feel. Kanon hits it bang on with the way that they wish to make you feel. I never found that there was a song that was distinctively out of place with the scene. The voice acting of each characters was quite distinct and crisp so you don't mix up them, overall this was quite a big aspect for me about the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nEven though I felt initially that the characters were quite samey to others I'd seen before the way in which they unveiled there back stories made them seem different. Yuichi was a really good character, he's quite unique for a lead as there is almost two sides of his character. At some times he'll be quite jokey and funny, but when things get serious he fits that role perfectly as well. The beauty of the characters is that there mystery that is continuously presented is what really the driving force of you wanting to keep going onto the next episode.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime a lot.The way they blended each aspect they were going for whether it be the supernatural side of things or the slice of life side made it overall quite an enjoyable experience that I would recommend for others to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it may not be every bodies cup of tea but personally I found it quite a dazzling anime so 8/10 \\n\\n",

            "content": "I tried by best to avoid spoilers.\r\nStory - \r\nKanon is a slice of life anime, set in a wintery town. The overall anime appears to take place during winter and ending with the melting of the snow into spring. The story itself also bears a faint resemblance to a musical Canon... where each of the notes (Characters sub plots) come together and harmonise. The main character is recovering the memories of his child hood  and he has returned to the snowy village. The story is funny at times, it had me in stitches and some of the on going gags are pure genius. \r\nHoweverthis slice of life breaks to reveal a down tempo, the plot develops into an emotional kicker.At times I was close to dropping the anime because it because very very depressing. However I stuck with it and like a true canon it came together and really provides a shocking ending. The plot is carefully written and every character is loveable in their own way. Each shine through the plot.\\n\r\nThe plot gets full marks from me as I feel it developed nicely and was very cleverly written.\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound- \\n\r\nArt wise there is some nice settings and the town becomes very familiar throughout. The sound for the anime is nice our opening theme plays and develops throughout, Pachibel's canon in D is also played through out as well as some more classical tunes. The music fits nicely as they all develop and harmonise. The pieces are mainly in minor however our opening theme and the canon are written in major, Signalling that our sad plot is dotted with hope. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - \\n\r\nEach character has their own personality which sparkles and each has a well developed back story. I at first disliked a few characters however by the end I loved them all. They grow on you through the very well written plot. The plot develops as one by one the back stories and explanations on each character is given.\\n\r\nYou will love the array of personalties gained.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall - \\n\r\nOverall this anime is certainly one I would recommend, If you are a lover of slice of life this is an anime for you. Also music lovers may gain some pleasure from this anime due to its mirror of the canon. Anyone looking for a good laugh will fall for Kanon's humour and wit.",

A troubled teenage boy helping a group of troubled teenage girls to overcome their problems and, at the same time, he learns how to overcome his.  Though, Key really pulled something off with both of these shows.  Sure they both begin the same way.  A cryptic monologue that is explained at the end of the story, an unintentionally-rude, teenage boy who helps about five teenage, girls.  They even have the mutual aspect of having at least one of the main, female charactersand the main, male character meet as children and part ways because of tragic accident (Kotomi and Tomoya; Yuichi and Ayu).  Though, don't let these similarities fool you.  Kanon's storyline travels down a completely different route, compared to Clannad.  One that is both unique and meaningful.  The dramatic dialogue isn't cheesy, there are some \"slice of life\" lessons worth holding onto, powerful symbolism, and a little bit of fantastic mystery (or mysterious fantasy, if it helps).\\n\\n\r\nI did notice that, sometimes, when mystery and fantasy are tied together, the story becomes hard follow (Clannad is the perfect example).  Though, don't worry, the story is cleared up, nicely.  You won't have to search for a forum that explains what actually happened at the end.  \\n\\n\r\nJust let the progress and you will see that this anime was shockingly, well written.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nI just realized how much I have typed so far so allow to paraphrase.  The show kicks ass! Watch it!\\n\r\nBye",

            "content": "WOOT first review.  This anime has just replaced D N Angel as my favorite anime of all time.  The story was just great.  I never thought an anime would ever make me cry and this one made me cry three times.  The art is one of the best ive seen in a while and the music and sounds they use are great.  I fell in love with every character but there is a few i like more than others.  I will say again this is my favorite anime and if you like a good story (and dont mind cryinglol) then i suggest this to you",
