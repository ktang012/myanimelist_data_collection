            "content": "**this review will contain minor spoilers**\r\nYoshiki Tanaka, you may not recognize his name but you've undoubtedly heard of his highly acclaimed behemoth Legend of the Galactic Heroes; a seminal war epic that influenced many series in its wake, with a legacy that still ripples through the world of anime and manga to this very day. When I heard that another one of his creations were going to get the anime treatment with Arslan Senki, my interest was immediately piqued. I was expecting another grand series with rich themes of political warfare, larger-than-life moments littered throughout and a far-reaching cast of developed personalities to carry itthrough. I was expecting a show that handled its content with a sense of gravitas, leaving no room for shortcuts. I was expecting something with a discipline, where proper writing and coordinated planning wasn't just an afterthought. And as if to solidify the deal even further, I found out that the character design work and manga adaptation of Tanaka's work was done by Arakawa Hiromu of Fullmetal Alchemist fame. The person behind one of the greatest war epics of all time partnered up with the person responsible for what's arguably one of, if not, the best shounen of all time. With such promising creators taking the helm, what could possibly go wrong?... Well, as it turns out, everything can. \\n\\n\r\nArslan Senki was an anime that attempted all of the qualities expected from a Yoshiki Tanaka work but done so with none of the nuance or tact. It's juvenile in presentation but takes things seriously, it relies on implausible scenarios but pretends to be strategic, and it reeks of abused literacy devices in substitution for proper storytelling. Arslan Senki was simply a war epic that wanted to wear big boy pants while still not knowing how to tie its own shoelaces. \\n\\n\r\nThe primary focus of Arslan Senki was a common tale that has been told many times over. A timid prince turned gallant leader slowly building his support and will to reclaim the throne that was stripped away from him. For all intents and purposes, the story itself was a coming-of-age just seen through the eyes of a more privileged individual. This isn't exactly a bad thing as long as the writing is solid. After being betrayed by factions within his own kingdom, Arslan, the crown prince of Pars, found himself fending for his life with everything around him being thrown into turmoil. This 1st season follows Arslan as he finds himself befriending new allies and growing out of his naivety with each new obstacle he's forced to encounter.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself was fine but the way it was handled was anything but. Writers often use characters within a story as plot devices to either move or manipulate the narrative to their liking. In order to make such an underhanded, yet necessary ploy less noticeable, the writers would evenly distribute the abilities or relevance among several characters, as a means to avoid turning any given individual into a Mary Sue/Gary Stu. So you can have a character who excels at X but not Y and vice versa. And while the set abilities and roles of the characters involved in Arslan were indeed separated, they only manage to avoid being Mary Sues/Gary Stus to only become HAX beyond probability instead. \\n\r\nNarsus was a HAX tactician to the point where no matter how unfathomable or detrimental the circumstances, he would asspull a strategy just in the nick of time to save everyone's asses. Daryun was a HAX warrior that made mincemeat out of hundreds of men with no visible signs of fatigue or any human tenancies to speak of. Gieve was simply HAX at life, as he seemingly found a way out of death flag territory time after time again with little in the way of proper explanation as to why. Falangies, for no God-given reason, turned into Trinity and walked through a barrage of arrows like she was auditioning for The Matrix. And finally, there was Arslan himself, a character that's so much of a goody-two-shoes, that if he was tossed into the Game of Thrones universe, he would have been dead in 5 minutes tops. There's being nice and then there's being unrealistically lenient, Arslan was the latter. He might as well be a Care Bear. \\n\\n\r\nThe implausibility of the characters wasn't the only problem that made itself apparent, the scenarios were equally as mentally challenging in that regard. To just name one example, we had a horse jump 20 feet into the air and landed a perfect mount onto a rampaging elephant to rescue someone at mid-gallop. And remember, this occurrence took place in a world that tried to be as realistic as possible. Something that felt inherently contradictory when the audience is shown actions akin to a Looney Tunes cartoon.\\n\\n\r\nThe show required a high suspension of disbelief to buy into it. It placed the characters up against impossible odds only for the outcome to always be the same. There's no struggle to become better. There's no uphill battle to the top. There's no fight that posed a challenge, despite the handicap they're constantly placed in. All that we ended up with was a HAX team of misfits that plowed through obstacles like they're the Justice League. When the outcome always manage to be the same, why bother to get invested? Trying my best to avoid comparisons here but this is why Legend of the Galactic Heroes is constantly held in such high regards. The outcome wasn't determined, both sides took causalities, suffered losses and had no jarring plot armor to speak of. It was relentless, it had tension, and it wasn't a one-sided victory. Arslan Senki never demonstrated any of these attributes and just ended up being too idealistic for its own good. \\n\\n\r\nAnother left-field issue that reared its ugly head was the random inclusion of magic midway through the series, which was up to that point, a \"realistic\" depiction of war. The show spent most of its duration trying to build a war drama where everything was grounded in reality but out of nowhere tossed in a new genre that was previously nonexistent. It single-handedly sabotaged its own foundation. This isn't like other medieval titles similar to Berserk, where there were foretelling signs of supernatural occurrences scattered throughout its runtime. No, Arslan never gave any indication whatsoever that magic would have worked its way into the narrative. The supernatural elements of Arslan just hits you like a Mack truck and if unprepared, can break any semblance of immersion that was established beforehand (that is, if you even had any immersion, to begin with). \\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation for the show were appalling, not only by modern standards but in general. There are titles in the mid-80s that show better fluidity and attention to detail than this. It doesn't even rise to mediocre status. Not even the inclusion of Arakawa Hiromu's character designs could save the numerous times the animators had inconsistent models. This was derp central folks! Picasso face pandemonium! Every time a character was presented at a different angle, the act of looking disturbingly off-putting was guaranteed. This was made even worse by the deplorable usage of CGI. It was breathtakingly bad, seeing hoards of CGI fodder soldiers, animals and other objects just plastered across landscapes with no effort to conceal them. I'm talking PS1 level graphics here. The kind of mismanagement expected from the early 2000s when CGI integration was still being played around with. It was truly a messy patch job, apathetically slapped together in a way that's too obvious to give it a pass. \\n\\n\r\nIf this anime had any saving graces, it would be in the music department. The show had grand sound to it that really helped in placing you in the middle of the action (even if the \"action\" was hoards of CGI dummies). The Iron Age vibe was captured quite well. The opening and ending themes were all pretty decent as well, and while not as important, even the cut-scene tapestries was a nice tough. None much of an auditory standout in its respective season but still serviceable nonetheless. And really, that's the bottom line with Arslan Senki as a whole, it's just serviceable but never becomes anything more. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Arslan Senki proved to be a challenging watch. It wasn't eye-candy, it wasn't smart and it was far from enthralling. What little it attempted to accomplish has been done better elsewhere to a much more successful degree \u2014 hell, almost everyone staffed to create this thing has a better version of this lying around. It barely managed to scrape by and when you take into consideration the creative minds behind the project, it's quite disheartening. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe show had a somewhat decent start but after a few episodes, what seemed like a sturdy foundation turned out to be a house of cards. I wanted to like this show but it kept on giving me reasons not to. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4.5/10\\n\\n\r\nArslan Senki was an overlooked title that has little to no hype behind it... and you know what? I hope it stays that way. Unrealistic to anyone paying attention to it and insulting to the eyes of anyone who watches it, Senki was an anime that had the backing of proven creators to become something great but spewed out a mishmash of bad ideas instead. It may have had good intentions but good intentions aren't enough to make a good anime.",

            "content": "When thinking about Arslan Senki, I tend to think of this show as a mixture of fantasy adventure, war drama, and a story that really emphasizes the journey of a young prince. Arslan Senki (The Heroic Legend of Arslan) is a show that chronicles more than just the making of a hero. It delivers a tale of adventure that should be remembered like a legend. For its themes and storytelling, I can safely say that this show is one hell of a ride.\r\nBased loosely on the novels and adapting the plot of the manga written by Yoshiki Tanaka, Arslan Senki is essentially a war story.In a role that requires more than larger than life dimensions, it is epic in an old-fashioned sense. And how does it achieve that? By its sheer ability to show its rich story.\\n\\n\r\nThe setting takes place in an alternative version of the Middle East. And from the beginning, we learn of a warring conflict that erupts between two factions \u2013 Pars and Lusitania. At a young age, we meet Arslan and he witnesses the reality of war; bloodshed, chaos, and death by the Lusitanian forces. The premise also establishes that Daryun, a former high ranking military officer gets acquainted with Arslan. The story then goes on to show the adventures of Arslan, Daryun, and others as they struggle to regain Pars. As with the way the premise sets up, there\u2019s a whole load of potential with its direction. In particular, there\u2019s character growth that really becomes evident for Arslan. In addition, we see character relationships that expands beyond just military acquaintances such as the relationship between Arslan and Daryun.\\n\\n\r\nIn the beginning though, we must first learn to understand who Arslan is. Thankfully, the pilot episode does just that as we see a young Arslan from the Kingdom of Pars deal with an escaped young kid. Turns out, the kid is a prisoner that escaped and is from the nation of Lusitania. The most important part however is his reasoning for hating slavery. In essence, the show prints an image into the audience\u2019s mind that conflicting ideologies can break out conflicts that leads to bloodshed, war, and death. It\u2019s also clearly evident that Pars and Lusitania have different views on social equality. In particular, religion and slavery become prominent aspects of inspiration for characters\u2019 motivations. I also have to give some praise for the show\u2019s ability to show its reality of war. It isn\u2019t shy to deliver violence when it comes to content. And by doing so, we can see how far some nations can go to get their message across.\\n\\n\r\nWhile essentially showing that Arslan is a na\u00efve young man, he is also known as the prince of Arslan. By holding such title, the people of Pars seems to hold a respect for him. In particular, we meet others that join him and Daryun along the way helps him in his quest to restore Pars. The journey they take involves obstacles while Arslan himself learns about different views of various countries and factions. For Arslan himself, the young man becomes more confident and even seems to be able to influence some others. His relationship with the people traveling with him demonstrates his loyalty and selflessness. In particular, Arslan and Daryun has a dynamic relationship as the two are nearly inseparable. There\u2019s a mutual feeling of respect the two holds for one another and Arslan treats him like a friend rather than a soldier. In his group, Arslan has a diverse range of characters. There\u2019s Narsus who plays the role of a tactical genius as well as Elam who serves him while developing a respect for Arslan himself. Joining them is Farangis, a priestess archer with a cold yet courageous attitude. We also meet Gieve, a traveling musician and curious adventurer with an infatuation towards Farangis. All these characters come from different backgrounds but forms a group to fulfill Arslan\u2019s ambitions. Throughout their journey, we learn more about each of them individually while characterizing their roles to define their finest moments. In retrospect, they also bring out the best of Arslan\u2019s character as he leads them with a solid ambition.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that stands out about the writing of the story is that each episode adds more and more to the bigger plot. While there is some pacing issues at times, it never derides from the premise. We see the journey that Arslan undertakes towards Pars while also witnessing the political and wartime affairs that they face. The obstacles Arslan encounters are met with various results almost each time but we always learn something new about their world. While the show isn\u2019t always able to capture the interest of the audience, it does present it in a way that is clever in terms of story development. Along the way, we also meet Silver Mask, a character that serves as the antithesis of Arslan. He is cruel, bloodthirsty, and prideful with an intent to capture the throne of Pars himself. As leader of the Luistania army, there\u2019s a sharp contrast between him and Arslan\u2019s personality. Almost each time he is shown on screen, there\u2019s ruthlessness that is enforced as Silver Mask stops at nothing to achieve his goal. What does this tell about such an antagonist? It means that Arslan has a huge obstacle that he must overcome in order to prove himself as a worthy prince.  \\n\\n\r\nThe world fiction of Arslan Senki is fantastic. Although labeled as a fantasy adventure, there\u2019s little actual fantasy elements that is adapted with the story. It exists though. There are a few instances when magic is presented but the war story elements of the series is what stands out the most. The Kingdom of Arslan is also well structured with impressive architectural design to give off its resourceful feeling. Similarly, Luisitania is a place of prosperity that can easily be seen with their welfare. Later on in the show, we are also introduced to the kingdom of Sindra with interesting aspects of its own alongside its cast of prominent characters.\\n\\n\r\nFor everything that Arslan Senki does right, there are also some parts that can be forgettable. In particular, the comedy sometimes feels a bit oddly timed. While it\u2019s mostly tolerable, there\u2019s a bit of repetitiveness going on. Some of the supporting characters are also easily forgettable with what they have to offer. Not to mention, a few of them are stereotypical with their ideologies; in particular the antagonists. The romance aspect of the show is also quite stale as Gieve tries to hopelessly win the heart of Faraganis while being rejected every time. Later on, Narsus attracts the attention of a young girl that becomes a bit of an annoyance for him and the audience. Finally, the plot of Arslan Senki may not be for everyone. While I personally enjoy the direction of the story, patience may be tested for some viewers as the pacing isn\u2019t entirely stellar. In addition, Arslan is a character that people may or may not like depending on personal preferences. If you don\u2019t believe me, just ask Silver Mask himself.\\n\\n\r\nUnquestionably, there\u2019s a familiarity with the character designs. Anyone who has seen Full Metal Alchemist would know this from first glance as Arslan looks like Edward Elric in terms of physical resemblance. After all, the character designs are based on the Hiromu Arakawa\u2019s version of the manga for its adaptation. In essence, the character designs are fitting for someone like Arslan. He is young with his signature silver hair, compassionate personality, and resilient youth. On the other hand, there\u2019s Daryun who stands out as a warrior with his iron clad-like armor and signature spear. In fact, almost everyone in Arslan\u2019s group stands out in some way whether it\u2019s Narsus\u2019 shoulder-length hair or Faraganis\u2019 fierce nature. While I\u2019m not a big fan of all the character designs, I do believe that Studio Lerche captured the intention of the manga when it comes to artwork. Additionally, we have cruel weapons the historical ages, war elephants, and other instruments of war with a decent degree of realism. Violence is no stranger to this show so expect some uncensored violence and blood to be spilled. However, what I give praise for is that Arslan Senki never goes overboard with its violent nature. It\u2019s just enough. And finally, the action is blockbuster hit that is hard to ignore and qualifies with classic moments.\\n\\n\r\nArslan Senki is also known for its breathtaking soundtrack. The war-like drama orchestra combined with the riveting nature of the show brings out each episode to life. The OP and ED theme songs are also memorable for its ability to tell a story just by its scenario of important scenes. However, the real strength comes from the voice actors and actresses. Each character demonstrates a personality that we can find fitting for their role. Whether it\u2019s Daryun\u2019s undying loyalty or Silver Mask \u2019s ruthlessness, it\u2019s very believable. Speaking of which, I had some doubts at first with Yuki Kaji playing the role of a main antagonist. However upon seeing Silver Mask\u2019s voice and role on screen, it\u2019s actually quite fitting.\\n\\n\r\nWhy should you watch Arslan Senki? In the end, it\u2019s up to perspective. If you\u2019re interested in a war story with interesting storytelling, strong characterization, and the journey of a prince, then you\u2019re in for a treat. Each episode expands on the story that keeps the audience wanting for more. Each episode shows us more about the characters that we want to know. And each episode captures the reality of war really is like in their world. Despite some concern with the comedy and pacing of the story, there is a lot of fun watching the show in the end.  It\u2019s not just about fighting to win a war but also making a difference for the young prince known to the world as Arslan.\\n",

My expectations for the story weren't really high especially have reading some of Kingdom (sorry low blow yeah I really should even mention Kingdom this is about Arslan Senki...) Anyway like said before the story is good but I did feel the pacing for episodes 17-23 could have been a bit better because I did indeed loose quite a lot of interesting in the semi-slice of life in a army they had going on during those episodes. Which is why Ipersonally can't give this an 8 so a 7.5 will do.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation (8/10) Very Good\\n\\n\r\nThe art is very good and the animation (at least for episode 24 that is was amazing) everything else as far as animation was either just good or sub par. It definitely wasn't really consistent when it came to animation and art style it would go from looking good to looking mediocre quite a few art style derps here and there but not on a Toei level. With that being said if the anime actually looked like what those still pictures looked like at the end of the first outro man it would have been amazing. The CG didn't bother me as is wasn't used too much.\\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10) Masterpiece/Outstanding\\n\\n\r\nNothing wrong in the sound department as the Openings and Endings are amazing well chosen for such a series, the voice actors were outstanding (JP VA) and the sound effects on weapons clashing sound real authentic. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8/10) Very Good\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Arslan Senki are very good also. With 25 episodes they did a good job fleshing out the cast and making everyone in the protagonist's group feel relevant and that's what you are suppose to do. Obviously Daryun stole the anime the dude is a best and he reminds me so much of Zhao Yun even their names kind of sound alike.. come to think of it Arslan reminds me of Liu Bei and Narsus of Zhuge Liang... hmmm maybe that's why I like them so much because I'm a giant ROTK fan.. anyway if those characters are inspired by those people it doesn't bother be because I loved them all.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10) Very Good\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment for this season of Arslan Senki was a roller coaster if I do say so myself. I'm not going to lie I wasn't excited every Sunday to quickly watch this anime because like I said around episodes 17-23 my interest was at an all time low to the point were I had to put it on semi-hold and let episodes pile up, because it just felt like when I watched 1 episode a week (as far as episodes 17-23 are concern) it kind of felt like i wasted my time. But episode 24 was amazing! BUT 17-23 at least to me was the least enjoyable...\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10) Very Good\\n\r\nMore Specifically (8.30/10)\\n\\n\r\nThere are multiple reasons why I chose to watch Arslan Senki when I first heard about an anime adaptation of this series was coming.\\n\r\n1) It's a war series and I apparently like those\\n\r\n2) The manga was drawn but the artist and mangaka of FMA so that stood out\\n\r\n3) The picture and character first shown when announced looked cool to me (yes that counts for something)\\n\r\nAnd just going off of those 3 things alone I wasn't disappointed by Arslan Senki I'm glad I chose this series and the end of this Season definitely left it inconclusive and a lot of openings for a second season. Hopefully it gets one because it deserves one.",

            "content": "The Heroic Legend of Arslan is an adventurous tale of how a young prince is driven out of his own kingdom, and how he must become a man worthy of leading his people to reclaim his kingdom. The whole series is about war and its stratagem. This show exceeded my expectations in several areas, which is why I felt compelled to write a review.\r\nStory:\r\nI want to start with the plot since it is what impressed me the most here. It is very rare to come across a historical and non-supernatural war anime that is this good. Each battle scene is carefully planned out. This isone of those series like NGNL or Log Horizon, where strategy is the most interesting thing about the story. But on top of that, there is plenty of revenge, betrayal, and other plot twists that keep the story\u2019s edge sharp. \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that impressed me about the plot was how well each episode was planned. There was never a single episode where I felt like I was wasting my time. I\u2019ll admit Arslan Senki has a rather slow story, like most war series. However, this is simply because it takes time to unravel every piece of the plot. The audience is offered several viewpoints from different angles so that no part of the story is overlooked. Even during the parts that are slow, each episode contributes to the plot and/or character development.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe characters are an important aspect to Arslan Senki. The character development of Arslan himself is very pertinent to the story. Prince Arslan is your typical heroic, young male MC: kind, gullible, easy to trick or manipulate, believes all people are good, hesitant to kill another human.\\n\\n\r\nThe other main characters in Arslan\u2019s fugitive travel party protect, advise, and counsel the Prince on his journey to find more loyal followers. They also teach him how to be a ruler worthy of leading his kingdom, while keeping his ideals intact. Arslan\u2019s relationships with his 5 loyal friends also develop throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation:\\n\r\nThe most notable point in this anime\u2019s art style is the detail of colorful Persian patterns. I often find my eyes fixated on the pattern of a character\u2019s clothing, a carpet, a wall tapestry, or other patterned things in the background. The color pallet of the artwork for this series fits well to the ancient Persian setting.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, as for the animation, there\u2019s one blinding CGI spoof in episode 1. Please don\u2019t judge the whole series. After that one mistake, the CGI is not disruptive anywhere else. Swordplay scenes are well done.\\n\\n\r\nSound & Music:\\n\r\nOP 1 and ED 1 are both superbly done. I didn\u2019t care as much for the second set of OP/ED.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is a very good fit to the setting and time period. The sound effects for each weapon are all accurate. And the voice acting fits well to the characters and setting too. \\n\\n\r\n-----\\n\\n\r\nArslan Senki has a few flaws here and there, so it really wasn\u2019t perfect. But it is still far above average. I consistently enjoyed watching the show each week throughout the season. If you are interested in watching a good war anime, I definitely recommend this one. Each episode of Arslan Senki was well worth watching the whole way through.",

            "content": "Prestigious parents often bear a burden of expectations for their children. Much to the doteful disappointment of the audience however, \u201cThe Heroic Legend of Arslan\u201d turns out to be something of a black sheep. Lovechild of original creators Yoshiki Tanaka (LOGH) and Hiromu Arakawa (FMA: B), Arslan shines a bright glow of mediocrity under the shadow of its peers. \r\nArslan bases itself on the manga, which in turn bases itself on the original novel, which at last takes inspiration from a loosely compiled set of Persian tales. If you weren\u2019t already familiar with the term \u201csuspension of disbelief\u201d, then you\u2019ll be quite capable by theend of the 25th episode. The story begins climatically as the \u201cundefeated\u201d king of Pars is defeated by the Lusistinian [European infidel] army after Pars is betrayed. Our titular main character, Arslan, is then thrust into seeking the crown because apparently, inexperience and innocence are signs of excellent leaders. Along the journey, Arslan attracts several companions who force the plot forward, exploiting an array of stupidly overpowered abilities. \\n\r\nIf this summary sounds somewhat familiar, it\u2019s because you\u2019ve already watched Akatsuki no Yona. As it turns out, \u201cthe King returns\u201d is hardly an original plothook. Arslan fails to differentiate itself from this association. Case in point, Arakawa goes as far as to replace Daryun\u2019s sword from the novel with a spear, in a direct parallel to Yona boyfriend #1. The most disappointing thing about Arslan\u2019s story however is not predictable plot structure, but rather the entire journey we take up to the final episode (queue 2nd season). When Arslan encounters problems, solutions are always in stock. Any meaningful consequences the story has to offer are whimsically avoided. The utter lack of tension stems from the fact that characters are never seriously threatened. This is fairly attributable to the abysmal performance of enemy soldiers, who switch on their autistic mode when faced with the slightest manifestation of \u201cenemy planning\u201d. Such mighty power seemingly retains divine superiority above all things, no matter how terrible the planning actually sounds. Antagonists rarely attempt to think of counter tactics, or even provide a contingency plan. There is little semblance of planning beyond the word \u201ccharge\u201d, as depicted by the Silver Mask who just cannot resist the opportunity to place himself in the most dangerous position possible, imitating the likes of Bronze LoL players. And even though they constantly outnumber Arslan\u2019s forces, there is never an attempt to use superior numbers to any tactical advantage whatsoever. In simpler terms, they demonstrate a consistently remarkable incompetency.\\n\r\nBut if tactical engagements become so predictable, then what does Arslan have left to surprise us? Magic, apparently. If you had any more than a sniffle of expectation for rationality left, then you\u2019re oft for a nasty awakening. Slightly more halfway through episode 12, xx_sketchy_pedo_assassin11_xx phases through the ground like a clipping ragdoll, staring menacingly at Daryun\u2019s behind before attacking [torpedoing] him. Just\u2026 why? Like many characters, magic exists solely because the writers were too lazy to provide coherent explanations for events in the story, shortcutting the pacing of plot progression. This has the added effect of cheapening out the audience\u2019s expectations. When it is revealed that the only reason Pars even lost in the first episode was because of \u201cmagic\u201d, Arslan\u2019s entire premise falls apart. Given how ridiculous most of the non-magical events in the anime already are, there doesn\u2019t seem to be much difference.\\n\\n\r\nThe prime instigator for the intellectually-triggering planning is Narsus, Arslan\u2019s near-omnipotent advisor. The party constantly relies on Narsus to deal with nearly every possible situation. Need tactical genius? He draws out half-baked bat-shit strategies and maneuvers like they were Yu-Gi-Oh cards. Political know-how? He may have only had court experience for a few years, but he acts the part of a cunning court wife. Family man? Somehow, this guy finds the time halfway through the series to pick up some random hobo broad. Definitely one of the less-human characters. \\n\r\nDaryun serves as Narsus\u2019s \u201cDynasty Warrior\u201d-esque counterpart, rescuing Arslan himself countless times. He goes beyond the physically impossible, as in episode 12 where he blitzes through time and space, bullet-timing several eurocucks in order to save the prince [princess] from xx_sketchy_pedo_assassin11_xx. I took a few moments to laugh at how ridiculous this shit looked when I saw it, but then I realized that they no longer had any intention of making Daryun even vaguely human. Yona at the very least justifies boyfriend #1 by pitting his efforts against attractive dragon boys. The only time Darius even appears to struggle is during his fight against the giant, where Darius appeared to be on the verge of defeat. Or at least, until we learn that he was faking effort all along so he could one-shot his opponent. Again.\\n\r\nGieve and Falangies serve little purpose beyond filling in as niche solutions to problems, what with Gieve\u2026 being there, and Geese inflicting Stormtrooper-level aiming at will (not that they would have hit anything anyway). Gieve constantly attempts to woo her in an effort at comedy relief, but their relationship doesn\u2019t get any deeper than the surface. Beyond that, I fail to understand why they even exist in the show.  \\n\r\nIt\u2019s precisely because of the swiss-knife efficiency of his party that Arslan himself undergoes minimal growth all throughout the series. The constant coddling reduces him to the role of \u201cfigurehead king\u201d. His first foray into battle actually seems to inspire PTSD in him, as he deals with the horror of slaying a man- Or so you\u2019d think. A few episodes later, he\u2019s back to happily sniping down cavalry. Likewise, he gives minimal thought to his companion\u2019s continuous slaughter of men, instead opting to save his compassion to slaves. In fact, Arslan bases the majority of his motivation for kingship on the abolishment of slavery. In the same manner as post American civil-war, he eventually learns that simply removing slavery does not always make a happy slave- Or so you\u2019d think. Towards the end, he proceeds to announce his intention to eradicate slavery without bothering to plan for an afterwards\u2026 But that\u2019s okay since his companions are so terribly OP he never truly needs to learn from his mistakes. This ignorance appears to be something of superior monarchal quality however, since it is the only reasoning his companions provide when asked why they serve Arslan. A truly remarkable display of loyalty. \\n\r\nOf special note is Etoile, a fanatical tsundere crusader who\u2019s given a chance to rise above the communal pit of shame. Her kidnaping-adventure with a young Arslan is what first inspires him to reassess Pars\u2019s slavery, later serving as justification for seeking the crown. Their third meeting performs likewise, spurring excellently reasonable motivation in our timid prince. He finally begins to somewhat confidently takes the role of decision-maker; a quality lacking throughout the rest of the series. It seems that out of all the characters in Arslan, Etoile is the only one that doesn\u2019t pamper or take advantage of him. There is an attempt at backstory in the second half, but sadly, it is rushed over quickly and reduced to nonimportance.\\n\\n\r\n\tAlthough sound design is not a common aspect of discussion, the usage of JoJo-like sound effects in combat is very overt. Scenes depicting heavy impacts are accompanied by a blearing amount of bass. What works in JoJo should, nevertheless, stay in JoJo. It sounds terribly misused in an anime that struggles to convey justification, instead suggesting that it merely exists to sound \u201ccool\u201d.  \\n\r\nDespite sharing Brotherhood\u2019s character design, Arslan\u2019s general art and animation is a far flung fantasy of a comparison. The opening battle introduces us to a use of CGI that is heavily parodied by modern cinema. An ineffectually zooming camera cuts across a blob-like engagement between two factions of generic, faceless soldiers for an inordinate period of time. This use of clay-soldiers seemingly holds true for any fight that involves large groups. Suffice to say, it is quite ugly. 2D horse animations are frequently terrible, closely mirroring the infamous \u201cquality\u201d horse animation in Spice and Wolf. For a series that sees fit to utilize horses in every single battle, you\u2019d think that they\u2019d have at least put some effort into this regard. \\n\r\nBattle choreography is similarly held in lesser regard. Characters often show little understanding of any martial technique that isn\u2019t a left or right slash when using swords. In fact, Gieve in episode eleven parries the same exact L/R pattern THREE times in a row, a brilliant example of what it might be like to fight Kirito\u2019s mook reincarnation. There are of course, two exceptions to this. In the first OP, animator Satoshi Kimura (probably him) makes excellent use of 3D backgrounds in the Daryun vs Silver Mask duel to incorporate a rotating 360 degree shot around the fight, an innovative technique that not nearly enough animators take advantage of. The penultimate episode\u2019s fight (once again featuring Darius and Edgelord) similarly excels. After whiffing his thrust, Daryun gores into a pillar, lodging his blade deeply into the structure. But instead of trying to free his blade, he gouges across the fucking thing into a follow-up horizontal swing. This no-fucks personality painted by animation certainly doesn\u2019t come across when all we see is character mindlessly one-shotting mass produced soldiers for several episodes.\\n\\n\r\n\tIn the end, perhaps you could say that this particular heroic legend just wasn\u2019t the kind for me. You could go on to suggest that warfare was never a crucial element to the story, and that perhaps, the emphasis of Arslan should be based on its portrayal of woefully ignorant royalty identifying problems within his Kingdom\u2019s internal practices, and going on both a physical and figurative journey to his maturity. But no matter how deficiently optimistic you choose to put it, Arslan never intended itself to be something great. Instead, Arslan basks quite happily in the rays of averageness, and we contentedly conclude that there really shouldn\u2019t have been much to expect anyway.",

            "content": "As someone who is a big fan of fantasy, Arslan Senki was right up my alley and it did not disappoint me. \r\nI wasn't expecting to enjoy it as much as I did, to be honest. The first episode was kind of 'meh' for me, but I stuck with it, and by the second episode I was like a ravenous beast; I needed more, more, more. I caught up on the show that day and watched weekly after that.\r\nWhat I enjoyed most was the moral compass this series is guided by, or rather, Arslan is. He's a just, fair young man with a very goodhead on his shoulders. His growth from a rather wimpy kid who only knows what he's been taught to someone who sees the world without judgement in the sense that if he disagrees with it, it isn't automatically seen as \"the wrong thing\", he just doesn't agree. \\n\\n\r\nYou can't help but root for Arslan as he starts his journey with Daryun, Narcissus and the others to reclaim Pars after it has fallen to Lucetania, because you want to know what kind of leader Arslan has it in him to be. \\n\\n\r\nEach character has the remarkable capacity for growth, and they do. Arslan's company grows to the point where if you were to place the old them and the new them beside each other, the differences would be stark. I love that, and in a series like this, surrounded by war and politics and religion, it's definitely necessary.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was phenomenal as well! Honestly, I think that's one of my favourite things, aside from the characters. The way everything was animated was simply gorgeous. \\n\\n\r\nThe music, also, was grand. It helps sweep you up into the moment. With each swell of the music, you're left sitting on the edge of your seat. What's going to happen? What's going on? Honestly the composer should receive some kind of reward for this. They capture the show beautifully in their music.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly now that I'm finished, I want to go back and watch it all again. I adore this anime and I can't wait for the second season. 2016 can't come fast enough!",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nThis introduction is difficult for me because I have no experience with war. Sure, I have historical knowledge, but I have never taken part in violence of that magnitude. I do not seek out confrontations, instead I seek out calm. I prefer friends over fights as it were. That is just who I am.\r\nI therefore must rely on the words of others here, rather than my own. There are a lot of famous phrases about war. \u201cWar. What is it good for? Absolutely nothing.\u201d A famous lyric sung by Edwin Starr. \u201cWar. War never changes.\u201d Aniconic statement of the Fallout video game franchise. \u201cWar is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength.\u201d Irony of monumental proportions, written by George Orwell and taken from his classic 1984. Each medium \u2013 from music to games to literature \u2013 thinks the same simple thought: war is always bad.\\n\\n\r\nAt least, that is how the vast majority of people think nowadays. Go back far enough, and you will discover that war was often the norm. Arslan Senki sits in this latter camp, portraying war, succession, and politics in anime form. Whether or not the show delivers a solid performance, though, is still up for debate.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nArslan Senki sets itself up as a prolonged adventure. A lot goes on, and a lot has yet to happen. Still, the anime covers a lot of ground in its first season, from big themes to involved battles. Again, there is a lot of plot left to get through, and while the show could be in a better spot the anime is not outright horrible either.\\n\\n\r\nThe narrative clearly states the end numerous times. \u201cAnd thus, the boy would become king\u201d and the title of the show The Heroic Legend of Arslan \u2013 where legend implies an immense level of fame achieved through exploits and success \u2013 spell out a complete win for Arslan. Thus, what matters is not where the plot ends up but how the plot gets there. What makes up the majority of the plot is the demonstration of war. Swinging swords, strategizing against the enemy, and the before-and-after effects. That last point is important because the downtime is where the show puts the most attention on its larger ideas.\\n\\n\r\nThese themes are heavy. War. Slavery. Religion. Arslan Senki targets ideas that are wide in scope and are therefore a bigger challenge to explore properly. The first two more or less see adequate development, especially war and its misgivings. War brings more than just death; war brings betrayal, camaraderie, fear, suffering, and understanding, all of which the narrative shows time and again. From the sacking of Ecbatana to the victory at Saint Emmanuel, the byproducts of war are interlaced throughout the experience. Slavery likewise plays a prominent role. Slaves\u2019 mistreatment, Ecbatana\u2019s fall, Narsus\u2019s background, Arslan\u2019s relationship to his people, and Kashan\u2019s persuasion are each examples of the ways in which slavery is explored, remaining relevant for much of the season. For both of these themes on war and slavery, the anime also manages to include the grotesque sides. Displaying the severed head of a traitor and the killing of captives proved that the show was not afraid to venture into the more unsightly aspects of these themes.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, the anime missteps with its religious theme. In the beginning, Yaldabaoth and the idea of conflicting ideologies has a major role in how the plot proceeds. The overzealous nation of Lusitania demolishes the powerhouse that is Pars because of their devotion to their god. Following the opening arc, however, religion is pushed to the wayside. The concept of religion is brought up later on with Hermes who denounces religion as nothing more than a farce, but a huge chunk of the plot ignores religion and its influence on not just the events but also its other themes on war and slavery. Of course, Falangies and Estelle are characters whose very traits revolve around religion, but they are not prominent enough within the narrative to add weight to this important idea.\\n\\n\r\nArslan Senki has an even bigger glaring problem in its narrative that is best described as a plot contrivance. Specifically, the enemy\u2019s dark sorcery is the home for too much convenience. Besides Falanngies\u2019s apparent ability to communicate with the Djinn, the anime almost entirely focuses on the believable aspects of war. Horses, castles, and spears make up the vast majority of the content. The tiny sliver that does not encompass the realm of the real is the evil magic that Hermes has at his disposal. This ally of his can materialize from the portals he makes, he can traverse quickly over land, and he can even bring others through the darkness.\\n\\n\r\nSimply incorporating this into the show automatically introduces potential issues. One, the bad guys can be saved whenever the show chooses \u2013 this happens near the end of this season. Two, the bad guys can appear whenever the show chooses \u2013 this happens during the splitting-up in the mountains as the troupe heads for Peshawar. Third and lastly, the bad guys can kill Arslan whenever the show chooses \u2013 this never happens but that is exactly the issue. For instance, in the final fight between Arslan and Estelle, the darkness not appearing to eliminate the young prince, despite him being alone and despite him fighting for his life, makes little logical sense given the anime\u2019s overall context. Granted, this dark sorcery is used quite sparingly. But this is still an unfair crutch that removes natural progression of the plot and instead favors a tool that artificially pushes the narrative where Arslan Senki needs it to go.\\n\\n\r\nAnother minor grievance is the anime\u2019s unwillingness to remove key players. It is fair to assume that Arslan, Daryun, and Narsus would continually live following each encounter. Arslan is the main protagonist and both Daryun and Narsus are vital to the crown prince\u2019s success. However Falangies, Gieve, Elam, Jaswant, and Alfreed, characters who are by and large not that important to earning Arslan\u2019s glory, are barely affected. The same can also be said of the enemy. Other than Kharlan (who died early) and Hermes (who is the main antagonist), Bodin, Xandes, and Guiscard are figures that still have a presence despite not doing much or meaning much to the narrative. Given Arslan Senki\u2019s penchant for war, not having any of these heroes or villains eliminated reduces the believability the show strives for. Again, to be fair, this is the first season of the series, meaning it is entirely possible that some of the aforementioned characters will perish in due time. But when the only truly harrowing moment is when Elam is wounded protecting Arslan, and even then the wound is not as life threatening as it could be, the narrative once again comes off as unfairly guided rather than naturally progressing.\\n\\n\r\nSimilarly and seemingly unnatural is, at first glance, the Sindhura arc. However that entire ordeal centers on three concepts. One, bolstering the credentials of Arslan. Joining ranks with another country and staying loyal to this country demonstrated his abilities as a trustworthy leader, giving him the necessary clout to establish his decrees. Two, recruiting Jaswant into his party. While much happens during this arc, one of the most important aspects is having Jaswant join Arslan\u2019s gang as further proof of his trustworthiness and his ability to unite disparate people. Three, the conflict is representative of Arslan\u2019s battle against Hermes. The clashing brothers, the power struggle, and the throne succession questions, combined with the capabilities of those rulers and their relationship to their father, mirror Arslan\u2019s own difficulties abroad. This in turn gives Arslan the chance to understand that birthright is not all that is needed to become king.\\n\\n\r\nYet this arc introduces an inherent problem: displacement of focus. While these qualities of this portion of the narrative are intentional and purposeful, this long stretch of episodes takes away from the main point of contention, namely Pars, Ecbatana, and Hermes. For a time, Arslan Senki becomes less about Arslan and his fight to win the throne and more about this aside that, ultimately, means very little to the grander goals at play.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime has other positives. The season ends on a total victory for Arslan, achieving a full-circle framing for the narrative that brings about a sense of closure to his initial defeat. The anime also has other negatives. The anime fails to give competent world-building. Other rival countries, terrain traversed, and societal life are barely investigated. Altogether, the anime does not entirely miss the mark with its narrative but there is definitely room for improvement.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nWhere Arslan Senki falters hardest is in its art and its animation.\\n\\n\r\nTo clarify, the anime\u2019s character designs are partially exempt from most of the issues. Most notable are their \u201ccrispness\u201d, the defined outlines and vibrant colors of the characters heavily contrasting with the backgrounds they find themselves on. The paleness of Falangies and Arslan, the intricate outfits of Alfreed and Daryun, and the striking eyes of Jaswant and Gieve make them almost pop out of the screen, their looks alone defining them. However their designs are more than just visually pleasing, holding symbolic purpose as well. Arslan\u2019s white hair symbolizes his innocence as a child and purity as a leader. Furthermore, his androgynous depiction is a clever way to highlight that Arslan is a ruler representing everyone. Daryun dons black armor, black representing strength and power, both of which the knight carries in spades. And Narsus\u2019s comparatively lackluster appearance actually reflects his deceptive nature; he does not stick out like everyone else, making perfect sense for the genius strategist. This type of analysis can be applied to each character, proving the strength of each of their designs.\\n\\n\r\nThe same kind of strength cannot be attributed to the rest of the anime\u2019s artistic and animation direction. There are three big problems with the art. First, the main setting. The mountains, the plains, and the forests inherently provide dull stages for the actors to use. Indeed, watching a bunch of rocks or seeing the group traverse through dense foliage is not the most impressive sight. Arslan Senki attempts to switch things up with the occasional fortress or encampment, but the majority of the show finds itself on the boring side of life. This problem stems from the second: the frequent battles. Due to the war theme, these mountain passes, open fields, and trees are needed because that is where war normally takes place. So while the places are not too enticing, their inclusion is forced. The battles, in turn, introduce the third problem: the CG. By far the worst aspect of the art is the CG. Its blocky textures are a negative, but it is the reused sequences \u2013 soldiers with the exact same faces standing right next to one another or the same set of animations used, just with reskinned people \u2013 that truly hamper the anime. The reasoning for using as much CG as the show did was to combat (coincidentally) the battles. Their size and frequency ultimately meant that resources were spread thin, this lacking CG art and animation having to be relied on more so than wanted.\\n\\n\r\nConsequently, actual animation follows suit. Much of Arslan Senki has animation of a level that is not what one would consider favorable. It is not just the calmer times, where the characters talk with one another without too much hair or body movement. The battles likewise see a downgrade. The camera often pans high to give a lot without showing too much action. The camera zooms in a lot, too, swords, bows, and halberds used but without finesse or choreography. Combined, the anime never really shows extensive fighting, resulting in less overall animation. The actual animation peaks during the first fight between Daryun and Hermes. The rest of the show, however, tends to keep most objects and people from moving too much. Again, the anime is not devoid of animation, but given the focus on war and battles \u2013 alongside the questionable CG work \u2013 the amount provided is sorely less than appropriate.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nArslan Senki is a classic case in anime when it comes to a singular main character and the many side characters that support him or her. In question form, how much is \u201cenough\u201d for the supporting cast?\\n\\n\r\nRealistically, nobody else matters besides Arslan. This is a story about the young boy, so do the side characters really matter that much? Daryun, Narsus, Falangies, Elam, Alfreed, Gieve, and Jaswant constantly surround the young prince, but this is not their story. As such, many of these characters have very little known about them. Falangies in particular gets the brunt end of the stick; she has zero noteworthy scenes, and outside of her temple disciple background and her ability to hold her liquor, nothing else worthwhile is known about her. She effectively sits on the sidelines making a comment or two during this initial tale. So it begs the same question as before, does having so little about specific characters negatively impact the show\u2019s execution when all that matters is Arslan?\\n\\n\r\nA difficult question to answer because that line in the sand is not definitive. For example, Jaswant is arguably the best of the side characters: the audience learns of his background, the audience witnesses his intriguing and parallel relationship to Arslan, and the audience eventually understands the Sindhuran\u2019s own convictions. Daryun, on the other hand, is the \u201cBlack Knight\u201d of unparalleled strength with an equal amount of devotion to Arslan. But the viewer does not learn anything else about him. His background is never shown, he seemingly has no flaws, and his relationships except to those of Arslan and Narsus are rarely expounded on. All of these problems, yet he was next to Arslan since the very beginning of their journey. Most of the supporting cast are somewhere between Jaswant and Daryun in terms of strength. Alfreed gets multiple venues of motivation, Gieve more or less tags along, and so on. Again, expecting extensive development for the entire cast is a fruitless endeavor. But to focus on each of them so minimally as Arslan Senki did?\\n\\n\r\nOf course, similar to Jaswant, there are other exceptions. Hermes stands as a wonderful antagonist, even if the narrative unfairly uses him as it sees fit. As Arslan\u2019s foil in more ways than one, Hermes is a man whose rage knows no bounds. Driven by revenge, the former king\u2019s son does not want the throne so much as he wants his cousin\u2019s and his uncle\u2019s head, doing whatever it takes \u2013 such as murdering his own people or betraying those he has joined \u2013 to achieve his ends. He is scarily powerful, maniacal, and technically in the right. His family was killed and his home was taken for yet-to-be-fully-revealed reasons, so his actions are not entirely unfounded. Still, this burning desire to kill those who have wronged him drives everyone away. This contrasts heavily with Arslan, whose behavior naturally draws people to him. However this fiery rage also symbolizes Hermes\u2019s eventual downfall. His one weakness are flames, caused by the trauma of his family\u2019s original slaughter. This fact alone makes Hermes a well-rounded character simply because he is not infallible just as Arslan is. For now, it remains to be seen if Hermes can be saved or if his inner fire will consume him, but as it stands Lord Silver Mask is not just a worthy opponent for the crown prince but also one of the strongest characters of the cast.\\n\\n\r\nEstelle (disguising herself as Etoile) is also worth mentioning. Initially the audience is introduced to a boy whose belief in his ideals pushes him where he needs to go. When Arslan and the boy grow up, the two meet again, only to part ways still butting heads. For a time, it appears that the boy no longer has a spot among the cast until the show reveals that he is not a he but a she. Estelle infiltrates Arslan\u2019s keep to inspire him unintentionally (once again), she inadvertently causes the fall of the Keep of Saint Emmanuel, and she, oh so slightly, begins to expand her narrow-mindedness. Arslan has a unique relationship with the girl; while mutual feelings of romance have yet to bloom (a guess, since a king needs a queen and the narrative is screaming for it to happen), the pair hold different approaches to the same ideas of life. Similar to Hermes and the rest of the cast, she has yet to fully develop as a character. But as is the norm with the first season\u2019s characters, she is poised for greatness later on down the road.\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair towards everyone that is not Hermes or Estelle, some leniency is warranted. This is only the first season of the anime. A second season is on the horizon and will, presumably, be a two-cour show as well. Meaning these separate problems \u2013 Falangies forgotten about or Daryun hardly experiencing hardship \u2013 will most likely be addressed later on. So for now, it is not that absurd to assume that the characters will get the attention they deserve in due time. That is, the first season essentially gave us the characters and their respective characterizations (however slight they might be) in preparation for their eventual growth in the coming season.\\n\\n\r\nAssuming much of the side cast can be overlooked, at the minimum it is then fair to expect Arslan to carry more weight than considered normal. Therefore, and keeping in mind the split seasons, the final question, how does Arslan fair as a character at this point? He started as a wimp. Na\u00efve of the world beyond the capital\u2019s walls, his first taste of war is utter defeat. He sees his friends die, his subjects perish, and his father taken in the span of an evening. Obviously unable to do much of anything by his lonesome, he enlists Daryun who directs him to Narsus, and there the true adventure begins. Along the way, Arslan gains more followers, usually of different creeds. A former slave, a bard, and a nomad are but a sampling of the people that pledge themselves to Arslan.\\n\\n\r\nTheir variety is precisely what gives Arslan his edge. He is not incredibly strong like Daryun. He cannot wield a bow like Falangies. He cannot cook meals like Elam. But what Arslan can do is lead. A leader is not someone who can annihilate his foes or has immeasurable riches. A leader is someone who gains the utmost trust of those he leads. Arslan does this through his kind heart, his empathetic nature, and his reliance on others. That last part is important because that is exactly what Daryun, Narsus, and the rest do. They might not change but they support, and in turn morph, Arslan into the kind of king he will need to become. Arslan is far from that conclusion, but in the short span of time he has fought to earn his rightful spot on the throne he, like Hermes and Estelle before him, is more than ready for what lies ahead.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, those previous questions will always remain heated points of contention. But for Arslan Senki, Hermes, Estelle, and Arslan do more than enough (this season) to overlook the lack of support for the supporting characters.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe first opening theme mixes rock and acoustics, providing a sound that simultaneously does and does not fit the atmosphere of the anime. The combination is weird but the strangeness gives the piece some much needed \u201coomph\u201d. The fast lyrics, alongside the adrenaline-filling instruments and back-and-forth vocals, also give the piece a certain allure that works to get the audience in the mindset needed for the show. The second OP takes a similar approach, but less determined and more emotional in its presentation. Unfortunately, only the repetition in the middle and end is memorable, the rest of the piece a cacophony of sound and lyrics as opposed to a coherent piece of music.\\n\\n\r\nIt is not until the first ending theme is heard that the true formidability of the music is heard. The incredible vocalist, the mood-setting instruments, and the beat of the track propel the piece away from \u201cjust another ED\u201d to \u201can ED worth remembering\u201d. Even the simple \u201cah\u201d as the song concludes demonstrates the power contained within. The only problem with the first ED is that it gave way to the second which is, understandably, a step down. True to Kalafina form, the track is both mysterious and grand in scope, a nice fit for the direction of the anime. The women both share and trade the spotlight, turning the piece into a swirling harmony of singing that is soothing on the ears (also true of most Kalafina pieces). While not as strong as its previous ED, the second one does what it can to fill the first\u2019s shoes and at the minimum finds a decent spot among the legendary tale of Arslan.\\n\\n\r\nThe remainder of the soundtrack is often of orchestral origins. Resounding drums, deep violins, and sharp trumpets are heard, perfect for that feeling of war. Given the Western and European setting, many of the pieces also incorporate vibes of a similar nature. Stringy guitars and simple flutes place the audience in the correct location and time period without coming off as overbearing. Other tracks are mysterious, violins and harps cloaking the viewer in a veil of the unknown, such as when Hermes visits Andragoras. Other tracks are lighter, such as when Arslan has his new troops trained, soft pipes uplifting the mood. And although the OST does not contain any noteworthy pieces, they do their job nicely enough throughout the season.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, voice acting in Arslan Senki sees about average performances overall. Wataru Hatano as Jaswant uses a surprisingly deep voice that works quite well. Yuusuke Kobayashi as Arslan is relatively new to the field, his childish voice a bit too kiddy for the king-to-be. And Shirou Saitou as Bodin is supposed to sound furious but instead sounds like he needs to clear his throat.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nPart of the reason why I was not liking this one as much as I probably should have is the characters. Falangies is beautiful but so little was given about her she was not that enticing. Gieve teasing Falangies was amusing, but not that funny because that is all his person became. Narsus is intelligent but he is a rather dull person to see on-screen. Arslan likewise fails to leave a lasting impression. He is nice and gentle, but he does not really do anything throughout the season other than yell out names and continually learn from those around him. \u201cPresence\u201d is the right word; nobody in the cast had a presence that affected me. No one is cute or funny or cool. They are all just\u2026there. And to be fair, that kind of realness not only makes sense for the anime but also means a lot to other people. However I would have liked to have seen a teeny tiny bit more eccentricity, considering how flavorful everyone seemed. Hermes might count, but listening to him throw a hissy fit each time he made an appearance got old quickly.\\n\\n\r\nThere was one shining ray of hope that pierced my heart, though, and that was when Estelle revealed her true identity. Seeing her slightly smaller height-wise compared to Arslan, her boyish attitude compared to Arslan\u2019s girlish one, and the encounters they had in the past, immediately caught my attention, setting my romance-gears in motion. I always wondered if Arslan would find a lover, let alone who it might be. Falangies? She is an adult and he is a child. Alfreed? She has fallen for Narsus (Elam has a shot I believe). Tahamine? The time period makes such incestuous relationships not too farfetched but that would be out of left-field. Therefore Estelle is the one for Arslan. All I wanted from the moment they talked in the castle and in the prison cell was for the anime to continue to explore their complex relationship. Of course I knew (and know) that the anime was not (and is not) going to head full-force in that direction \u2013 this is an anime about war and Arslan\u2019s journey to become king, not some romantic-comedy. But the romantic in me yearns for more. As such, I remain hopeful for the upcoming continuation.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless of the characters and the potential romance, the other entertainment factor of Arslan is the fights. There is approximately a battle every other episode, be it a duel or a large-scale conflict. The show does its best to diversify each one: one skirmish uses fog to mask a trap, another still lures a battalion onto a thin sheet of ice to send them to a watery grave, and another involves stampeding elephants. Despite the show constantly changing tactics, I never once found myself emotionally invested in the anime. Perhaps it was because I \u201cknew\u201d that the show never had the guts to kill off any of the main cast, but I was never cheering for Daryun nor was I clapping as Narsus\u2019s plan worked flawlessly per usual. The fights were not boring per se, but as I was with the characters I was not invested in whatever the show happened to dish out.\\n\\n\r\nArslan Senki is the start of a journey, a start that got off on the semi-right foot. The characters are primed and ready to go and the music at times is easy on the ears. But the poor art and animation direction, combined with the less-than-stellar narrative, bring everything down further than the show would like. Hopefully the next iteration does not follow war\u2019s path and instead changes for the better.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fine, heavy themes of war and slavery, theme on religion forgotten, unwarranted plot contrivances, intriguing parallel narrative in the Sindhuran arc, and mixed structural decisions\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Bad, very nice character designs, poor artistic direction, and below average actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, while many of the supporting characters have yet to actually do much of anything they \u2013 alongside Hermes, Estelle, and Arslan \u2013 have promising starts\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fine, good first OP, bad second OP, fantastic first ED, good second ED, okay OST, okay VA performances\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Fine, an uninteresting cast, uninvesting battles, and a dash of potential romance provide a competently entertaining beginning to this tale\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 5/10",

            "content": "Arslan Senki is a truly great anime. I was hesitant to watch it when it released, despite taking a liking to the synopsis, but I was swayed to give it a go with the beautiful art style (IMO).\r\nThe first episode took a turn quicker than I expected. I was launched straight into the story and it was amazing. They relayed the story in a fast-paced but certainly not rushed span over 25 episodes very cleanly. Once the story started to heat up we were given the ties to the loose ends and openings to new developments without breaking the story or overdoing it. Not manyseries can do that smoothly. \\n\\n\r\nThe fact that \"good always prevail\" wasnt plastered over each battle, gave relief to me. Not that it wasnt given but things happen in this anime where a hero isnt always there to save the day. The inner workings of war and history really give more depth without being boring to the viewers!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters were evenly distributed in screen time but still left mystery to some development. New ones came and went and they still gave enough progression for the enemy to give characteristics to the show.\\n\\n\r\nArt as mentioned was what truly swayed me into watching this anime. It  has beautiful work, easy on the eyes and no movement left out.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtracks were fitting and committing to the situations. Both OP's and ED were great! \\n\\n\r\nI was drawn in to this anime through adventure and was captivated by the actiona and drama to be left with attachments, suspense and ample room for development.",

            "content": "Let me just start off with saying this. I just finished this series and I feel pretty happy. Not sad, not angry, or frustrated. Just happy. I think its important to note this because when it really comes down to it, anime, no any art form is supposed to inspire feelings. These feelings are what make our lives more enjoyable and become important pieces of ourselves. This anime made me smile. So if you take anything away from this review, first take away that it is worth watching and will make you feel the spirit of adventure and kindness. \r\nI would say the story isexcellent. It is thought provoking, has few plot holes and  leaves the viewer with a sense of mystery after each episode. This story really hits the ground running. After looking back from the first few episodes, a lot has happened. It isn't because I forgot but merely because there is so much going on that by the end, the events that happened at the beginning have tied together with the end. One another note, the story isn't complex (different than being eventful). There aren't many side stories going on and each iteration of the plot ends up meeting back to the main story. So in summation, the story is bulky but not confusing, which could be a nice break if any of you have just finished a confusing or saddening series. This anime heavily emphasizes the disputes of crusaders. The main enemy group, is a kingdom of religious warriors (this is not a spoiler). Much like in the Crusades by the Catholic Church in real life, these people are always trying to force their rules and views on their opposition. It really makes you think about what is truly right. On a side note, I have been raised Catholic so I really felt some neat feelings while watching this anime. Anyone with a religious belief, or even without one but with a belief in something, can understand the idea that \"your way is the only way.\" It is hard to think around it. But this anime really shows you how horrible it looks when you try to force your ideals on others. Overall, great story. Nice and simple, but filling and somewhat mysterious. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is great. So many characters make such an imprint in your mind that you wish this series had more episodes just to see more art. it isn't what makes this series work, but it definitely doesn't hold the rest of the anime back. Some of the LARGE scale fights look a bit dinky at times but that is only because I assume it is tiresome for the writer to make never ending soldier images. The single combat is done very well, which is a big plus. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound actually didn't really catch my attention but the fact that I was feeling emotions from the scenes that mattered is a good indicator that the sound made a difference. I wish I had more to note on the music but it was what is was; not that bad but didn't leave a mark like others have done. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters and their development was what really made this anime. Not only will you fall in love with the art of many of the people, you will grow to feel for many of them. Each has their own subtle role to fill but you aren't really told what they are. Sure, you have the main character acting as a kingly figure, but everyone else is kind of on their own. Each character also changes over the course of meeting the main character, Arslan. What I find especially astounding is how well even some of the enemies tie together (I won't spoil anything but it is done pretty well). From the very beginning, the main character is exposed to all sorts of evils and treachery. He kills people but hates it, he cares for people but learns to do his duty. As the characters progress, you will question if what they do is right, and will wonder what is going on for each of them. Truly an intriguing set of characters.   \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed this series with vigor and admiration. It is done well and although I grade it an 8, that is merely a baseline. It may suit people better than others but if you watch it you will surely leave it feeling happy and enabled to do good in the world.",

            "content": "So I'm back to anime and I decided to start by reviewing Arslan Senki. An anime that I was really hyped for basically because of the name ''Arakawa Hiromu''. For the few people that might don't know she is the creator of one of the most successful manga of all time called ''Fullmetal Alchemist''. But she doesn't stop there as sh is also the creator of the really interesting school life ''silver spoon'' which is a title that makes you want to drop everything and attend an agricultural school. So generally speaking Arakawa has a really respected name in animanga community and seeing her newtitle called ''Arslan Senki'' getting an anime adaptation I believe lots of us were more than excited to see the results which were... utterly disappointing. And here are the reasons.\\n\\n\r\n''Arslan Senki'' started of with a humble first episode and as it was going on everything showed that it was going to be the hidden gem of the spring season (that wasn't so hard though the spring season was horrible). And indeed the first three episodes were more than enough for building the hype. The fights were really good and the story was developing slowly but with a steady and interesting pace and it also set some good questions about religion and war. And few episodes before reaching the middle this series looked like a realistic anime that could be a masterpiece. But only until the middle. Because after that Arslan Senki became entirely ridiculous. Suddenly we  had supernatural entities and people who could jump from their horses to the backs of elephants (!). And ok I may exaggerating a little bit too much so let's just say that Arslan is not a realistic anime. That still doesn't excuse the stupid characters that fell to the childish war techniques that the supposed master tactician called Narsus was setting. Neither the fact that after a while we were seeing exactly the same thing!!! Arslan and his gang arrive to a place with peaceful purposes but the king of this country is evil and tries to set a trap to Arslan's army without of course any luck.\\n\\n\r\nArtistically also the anime had a lot of problems. The animation was horrible. Even initially you could say that it was mediocre but at least not so dreadful as it was in the latter episodes. The poor CGI graphics made thing even worse. The soundtracks were good there were some memorable and interesting works. The openings were performed by Uverworld and NICO touches the walls (personal favorite Japanese band) and while good if you have heard  other songs from those two bands you will admit that were not their bests. The voice acting didn't have any exceptional performances because the characters didn't have anything interest to make anyone stand out.\\n\\n\r\nWhich brings me finally to the characters. Arslan was plain boring as the protagonist. I really hoped for an extremely good development but in the end this development didn't come. Daryun was too perfect for me and Narsus was also boring as hell. In fact the only character that I actually liked was Gieve's character but near the end he disappears leaving us with all the uninteresting characters. The character design was also disappointing. It seemed like  Arakawa was trying not to copy FMA's artwork but she ended up copying FMA's artwork after all. Silver Mask while initially an interesting villain as the story progressed he became a cliche villain that you can find in another twenty anime or so.\\n\\n\r\nOk I know that I shouldn't blame so much Arakawa because she doesn't have any connection with the anime apart from the source material. So in order to be fair I maybe should read the manga because the anime had a really open ending without any resolution. Now if you should  watch the anime my answer is no. While it starts really promising the creators don't know what they want destroying this was a story that could be really good. You will not believe that the creator of the manga is also the creator of our all time favorite FMA\\n\\n",

            "content": "I didn't want to watch Arslan Senki but boredom bit my ass and here we are, pals.\r\nIt's all about some prince's journey who tries to get his city back because people betrayed him. Nothing new here. This is Akatsuki no Yona minus the romance (but no worries, the harem is still there) meets the Eastern setting of Magi meets Kingdom but without the captivating warfare narrative. I won't say it lacked action because it got plenty but it definitely lacked something that would have made the story enthralling. The mystery behind Arslan's identity was a good start. However, this subplot was not developed fully whichleft me with lots of unanswering questions.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters don't change and are often one dimensional -- there are little development and even less growth. They are pretty much all OP and often find easily their way out of desperate situations. For a story that is character-driven, they didn't evolve much.\\n\\n\r\nPlease, tell me which one is the brightest banana in the bunch because they all seem like (endearing) losers to me:\\n\r\n- There is the good guy with white hair (of course he has white hair). He's so innocent and righteous and wants to save everyone because this is the right thing to do, right? In real life, my precious son Arslan would have gotten killed faster than Ned Stark. Did I mention he has white hair? #specialsnowflake\\n\r\n- The invincible dude who only got two words in his mouth: 'Your Highness', and oh boy, that's one hell of a talent waste for Hosoya Yoshimasa. Even that ambiguous loyalty for Arslan was off-putting at times. Does he love him like a mother or a lover? Don't know, can't tell. But choose, mate, you can't do both.\\n\r\n- The one more OP than Aizen and Madara combined. He knows everything but tells no one, always gets what he wants and his plans never fail because he's so clever. Plus the bishie is voiced by Namikawa Daisuke. I'm telling you, perfect. Wait. He does have one flaw: he can't draw. Oh, my bad. Let's not forget there are two kids vying for his attention -- one seeing him as a father figure and the other as a lover but the dude is a blank sheet of paper who gives no shit.\\n\r\n- Then there's the priestess who's there because?? Who knows? Maybe they needed someone with boobs to please everyone. I'm still waiting for the reason she serves our precious Snowflake Prince but I guess it's in the trash with the other character developments I should have got.\\n\r\n- And finally, the other bishie who can do anything but sing? Funny thing since he's supposed to be a minstrel but the dude doesn't know how to rhyme. He may be the funniest character in that show but I feel like there is a heavy story behind his playfulness. Why does he hate royalty? Why does he travel and where does he go? Why a troubadour knows how to ride a horse, use a bow, spar with knights and seduce women but can't make fucking rhymes? So many questions, Grieve, come back and answer them.\\n\r\n- I forgot the spy who comes from a loosely-inspired India and acts as the only diversity in this cast of happy misfits and the religious fanatic named '\u00e9toile' which means 'star' in French. If their goal was to make me cringe, it is a success.\\n\\n\r\nDespite that, this bunch is lovable. Lovable idiots who are so naive I wanted to engrave my head on the wall.\\n\r\nBut still better than the antagonists. We got a hothead boy with daddy issues, who got facial burn and is voiced by Yuki Kaji but I swear it's not Shouto from My Hero Academia. And for some reasons, everyone follows him because of plot convenience. Also, there is this country invading the land of our heroes, sacking the capital, burning the books and all instruments of knowledge, waging wars that kill millions of people so they could convert those same people to the religion of a god with an unpronounceable name. Japanese are truly amazing. They know how to make one-dimensional characters like no one else.\\n\\n\r\nNonetheless, this anime teaches interesting human values. It tackles the infamous subjects of slavery and religion, despite how ridiculous their depiction of religion is. It stays roughly shallow but I'd like to thank them for the effort. \\n\\n\r\nIt's a shame though. The beginning promised a tale of blood and vengeance with a complexed protagonist on an epic journey to regain his home, internally torn as he's discovering more about the world and his own identity. Sadly, it failed to deliver.\\n\\n\r\nI'd love to criticize the art but there is not much to say. The OST was gorgeous to hear, it's perhaps the redeeming point of this anime. The seiyuu's acting was on point and the opening and ending were wonderful to listen and watch. Especially the first ending signed Eir Aoi who got me more hyped than the actual anime.\\n\r\nThe average viewer will not notice the 'subtle' mix of 2D and 3D which was hideous yet funny to see. The fights were well animated but the battles... Please don't let this studio ever animate a battle again. As I said, characters are freaking stones, so they don't do lots of facial expressions but on top of that, they move like legos and honestly, it was hilarious to watch. Now don't get me started on the horses' animation, I've said enough already.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it lacked some conflict to create an engaging tale. Characters were nice but did not reach their potential. I'm lowkey disappointed because I was waiting for more from the guys that brought us Fullmetal Alchemist and Legend of the Galactic Heroes but it still entertained me. I'm not sure if I'll remember it tomorrow though.\\n\\n\r\nPS: There is this fabulous scene where a black guy with abs jumps on an elephant while riding his horse. Thank me later.",

            "content": "I'll be honest, I was somewhat reluctant to watch this show.  I had just finished the amazing show known as Akatsuki no Yona (Yona of the Blushing Dawn) and was not particularly interested in watching another, probably not as amazing, show of similar genre and plot.  In the end, I'm glad I watched it though.  It's certainly not the most perfect of shows, but it definitely had it's high points.  So, ladies and gentlemen, here is my opinion of the show Arslan Senki, aka The Heroic Legend of Arslan.\r\nStory: 8\r\nThe plot of this show was surprisingly satisfying.  Yeah, it hadmany similarities to Akatsuki no Yona, but so did Zankyou no Terror (Terror in Resonance) to Death Note, and I still enjoyed that show despite the fact.  While at first it may seem like any other story that we've seen thousands of times before, what sets it apart is where they take that plot.  Other than the bare base of it, the show ended up being very different from AnY, which is why I was glad I didn't skip over it.  The use of strategy blended with epic action provided an excellent presentation of the art of war.  It was different enough to keep it interesting, but also familiar enough so that it almost felt nostalgic, like a storybook one would read as a child.  And while I was a little bored in the beginning, as the series progressed I could feel myself becoming more and more invested and interested, to the point where I just couldn\u2019t wait for the next episode to come out.\\n\r\nThe only reason I didn\u2019t give the story a 9 was because at times the battles seemed too perfect.  I mean, when you have an expert strategist so all of your plans go perfectly and a warrior who might as well have been a Greek god, what more could a prince want?  Throw in a couple other amazing fighters to the gang, and you\u2019ve got the most convenient team of all time.  Now sometimes this set up can work; just look at No Game, No Life.  But unfortunately, Arslan Senki doesn\u2019t pull this off as gracefully as No Game.  While I was certainly enjoying the show, tension just wasn\u2019t part of that enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5\\n\r\nI\u2019m going to give you one name to encompass my feeling of the character designs in this show: Arakawa Hiromu.  Don\u2019t recognize the name?  Perhaps you\u2019ll recognize her as the creator of Fullmetal Alchemist then?  Yes, the creator of Fullmetal Alchemist designed the characters for this show, so of course they\u2019re fabulous and gorgeous.  They\u2019re colorful and interesting to look at and simply wonderful.  Of course I\u2019d expect nothing less from Arakawa-sensei.  The only negative thing I can think of is that Arslan looks kinda girly, but hey, little details.\\n\r\nSo you may be asking yourself why I gave Art a 5 when here I am singing the praises of the design.  Well, I\u2019ll tell you.  The animation.  It.  Was.  BAAAAAD.  Okay, BAAAAAD may be an exaggeration, but it was definitely not good.  The movements were stiff and jumpy and unnatural, and watching those horses move physically hurt me.  Now, I won\u2019t fault them too much for horses because they are one of the trickiest animals in existence to animate, and finding a well animated horse in an anime is a rather rare sight.  What I will fault them for is the CG.  The horrible, horrible CG.  In my eyes, CG should mostly be used on non-living things: cars, magic and effects, and other inanimate objects.  Sadly, that\u2019s not what animation studios use it for.  They use it for things like monsters and large crowds of people, living things in other words.  And looking at what they\u2019ve given me, I\u2019ve decided for myself that living things simply move too complexly and noticeably for CG to animate and still make it look natural within the rest of the series.  Arslan Senki essentially did everything I DON\u2019T want studios to do when they use CG.  Not only did they use it on large crowds of complexly moving, fighting warriors, they had the gall to give us up-close shots of horrendous CG warrior faces as they awkwardly jerked around.  Not even the beauty of Arakawa Hiromu\u2019s creations could fix the terror that was the animation.  Everything about it just screamed \u201clow-budget\u201d which is a real shame indeed.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nI\u2019m a little conflicted over the opening and ending tracks.  The songs themselves were great; I mean, you can never go wrong with NICO Touches the Walls (Hologram - OP 2 of FMA: Brotherhood) or Kalafina (Magia - ED of Madoka Magica), but I wonder just how well these songs really fit with the show.  I mean, I guess they work, but sometimes I couldn\u2019t help but feel like the creators just said to themselves, \u201cHey!  These bands are popular!  If we use their music, we\u2019re sure to get views!\u201d  The only song I really felt went well with the series was the first ending, Lapis Lazuli by Aoi Eir, and then halfway through the series it was\u2026 well\u2026 replaced.  As for the OST, it was pretty standard, though I will admit that it fit the show much more naturally than the OP and ED.  It\u2019s got your classic \u201cwe\u2019re off to war!\u201d epic battle music with lots of horns and brass, but nothing that really stands out from the ordinary.  Then again, do you really want the OST to stand out all that much?  It did its job, and it did it fairly well, so I\u2019m not going to fault it for that.\\n\r\nAs far as voice acting goes, Arslan Senki is pretty average in that regard as well.  The voices fit the characters well, but they seem kind of\u2026 how to put it\u2026 flat.  There just wasn\u2019t a whole lot of variety to how the actors said their lines.  One character would always sound like he\u2019s shouting while another always sounds sassy while another always sounds apathetic while another always sounds growly.  This made the characters themselves seem kinda two-dimensional, which is hardly a good thing.  Then again, this isn\u2019t exactly uncommon in the majority of anime out there.  Does that make it forgivable?  Maybe for some, but for me?  Not really.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7\\n\r\nAs I said about 5 sentences ago, the voice acting puts a damper on the characters themselves.  They seem kind of flat whenever they talk, like their manner of speech is their most defining feature.  However, this is partially made up for by the writing.  Throughout the course of the show, some of the major characters get their share of development, and you begin to care for them after a certain point.  There\u2019re two major problems here, though.  One: only some of the characters get developed.  The others are just kind of\u2026 there.  There\u2019s nothing wrong with them as a character, but we just haven\u2019t been given a reason to really care about them yet.  We get a bit of that in the sequel, Fuujin Ranbu, but this isn\u2019t a review of the sequel, now is it?  The second problem is the delay.  You don\u2019t really begin to become interested in the characters until a few episodes in, which makes the beginning a little slow.  I think you\u2019re supposed to like Arslan from the beginning, but even with him it takes a while to see what he\u2019s really made of.  As far as characters go as a whole, they\u2019re enjoyable enough, but it\u2019s a slow burn before you get to the real meat.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nI\u2019m the kind of watcher that can forgive a lot of sins so long as the plot and characters are good, because that is where my main enjoyment comes from.  Arslan Senki was a show I was really quite interested in, but even with my forgiving nature there was too much blatantly wrong with it to fully immerse myself in the experience.  That\u2019s not to say I didn\u2019t enjoy it; however, if it wasn\u2019t for the underwhelming character portrayals and horrific CG, I might have enjoyed this show much, much more.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\r\nYou can tell that this show has a very solid foundation (if you didn\u2019t know, the show is based off a very successful novel series) and a whole lot of potential.  What\u2019s a shame is that it just didn\u2019t have the resources necessary to fully realize this potential.  What we did get, however, wasn\u2019t terrible; I\u2019m sure the common anime watcher will have little problem deriving enjoyment from this show.  Is it a masterpiece?  Unfortunately, no.  Is it still good?  You bet.\\n\\n\r\n(A note on my ranking scale: My average anime score is 7.  This is because I rate on quality and enjoyment, not in comparison to other works.  A 5 would be something I was completely indifferent to, and since I somewhat enjoy most shows I watch, my average is 7)",

            "content": "Arslan Senki captivated me from the moment I began watching. From its music to its diverse and loveable cast of characters, this anime has so much to offer to its viewer that it merits two play-throughs to get the full benefit. There\u2019s already a pretty good synopsis written above so I\u2019ll spare you that and jump right into the review.\r\nArt: 8\r\nWhile the vast majority of the art is fantastic the CGI is rather noticeable and jarring at times. Though, I do completely understand the reasons for utilizing this technique. They needed to animate massive armies numbering in the tens of thousands. To do so byhand or traditional methods would be tedious and a waste of time/resources. Everything else was spectacular \u2013 from the set pieces to the characters themselves. You can easily ascertain the tone of a particular scene by the art alone. When telling a story art, sound, and characters all have to work together to illustrate the plot, and this anime succeeded in that regard.\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nLet me just say that the soundtrack is PHENOMINAL. It\u2019s so damn good that I play it on repeat while I\u2019m gaming. It\u2019s different from most soundtracks that you\u2019ll hear in other anime, and fits the tone and setting extremely well. As far as audio/sound effects are concerned \u2013 they are expertly done. Something as simple as the swing of a sword sounds full and believable. When a powerful character enters the scene your ears are greeted by heroic (or menacing) fanfare and a specialized soundboard. When the iconic characters, such as Daryun, swing their weapons about its something akin to a hurricane. When they make contact you can almost feel the impact. Everything about these characters sounds powerful and epic.\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\r\nIt\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve fallen in love with a cast of characters. Arslan Senki presents us with what I like to call a \u201cHero Themepark.\u201d Basically this is a show that centers around a set of heroes who are, aside from a few bumps and bruises, seemingly invincible. Though this concept applies to the villains as well. So what happens when these epic, near-invincible characters collide? Some of the highest octane, nail-biting action you\u2019ve ever seen in an anime. When a character is defeated or dies it feels like a god has been slain, and it changes your perception of the victor entirely. \u201cHe/she is far more powerful than I thought.\u201d You\u2019ll see these heroes take out entire waves of enemies all by themselves. Daryun\u2019s name alone strikes fear into the hearts of enemies.\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nThe series is a MUST WATCH, and is severely undervalued. You can find it on Hulu or Gogoanime. The story, characters, and music are all on point and work together to bring one of the best series of 2015. If only season 2 wasn\u2019t 8 episodes long\u2026wtf man. \\n",

            "content": "I like anime with action and mystery, but it is my first time seeing an anime about war and knights, so I didn't expect too much for Arslan Senki. But it was absolutely great ! \r\nStory : 9 / 10\r\nThe story is really interesting. It shows the war in its very aspects, such as barbarity, the motivation of both sides : Pars and Lusitania. Neither of them are clean, since Pars use slavery and Lusitanians kill those who don't believe in their god. The young prince Arslan will have to restore its kingdom, but it won't be easy. The different battles are epic, sometimes violent,but they were well-done according to me. Moreover, the anime is not just about war,  we have some magic into it (although it wasn't well-developped), mystery, and also funny moments. Plus, the relationship between the characters is pleasant. We know why they are here. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters : 9/10\\n\r\nThis anime has great characters ! At first, I thought that Arslan would be annoying, since he was always protected by Daryun, but he's a good character. He's kind and he gradually becomes mature. He realizes the atrocity of the war, but he also tries to understand the motivations of his ennemies. Moreover, he isn't weak. Then, we have Daryun, one of the most powerful warrior in Arslan's side who can be overprotective, Narsus the excellent strategist (all of his ideas were impressive), Elam the cute and loyal servant, Gieve the funny and highly skilled poet, and Farangis the beautiful archer (at first I was afraid that she would be only there for the fan service but fortunately it was not the case). I enjoyed their personality, their strength, their skills, and they made me laugh a lot. At the opposite, we have Silver Mask as the main antagonist, who is eager to become the king of Pars. He's strong and scary, and one of the best ennemies I've ever seen in an anime. And as the story progresses, different protagonists make their appearances, in both sides. Alfreed was annoying at first but she was also funny and useful during battles, just as Kishward, Jaswant... And the conflict between Rajendra and Gadevi during the Sindhura arc was really interesting, without forgetting Etoile who comes back during the second half of the show, and also in the end.\\n\\n\r\nArt : 9/10\\n\r\nI really like the chara-design, it is similar to those of the manga, illustrated by Hiromu Arakawa, and the moves of the characters during the battles were really fluid (I agree that sometimes there were some problems, but they were minors, and I was so enthralled by the show that it didn't matter for me.\\n\r\nThe backgrounds were absolutely amazing. Colors were beautiful, and they also took care to do oriental style backgrounds, especially when the protagonists are in Sindhura.\\n\\n\r\nSound : 9/10\\n\r\nThe ost perfectly stick with the different events, especially during the battles, and emotional moments such as in the last episode (spoilers : when Etoile is coming to say a prayer for the fallen soldiers of Lusitania). I also enjoyed the openings and endings. Both of the openings are dynamic, and I really like the ending \"One Light\" by Kalafina.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I really enjoyed this anime. It became one of my favorites. I didn't expect that. The two last episodes were amazing, epic and beautiful. But it has an open end, some mysteries still remain, so I hope for a second season.",

            "content": "So to start of this is one of those anime there you should watch atleast 3-4 episodes before judging and here is why. \r\nThe story is one of those fantasy tales we have heard of in old books about the boy in the high castle learning that life isnt so easy or nice as he has thought all his life protected in the bossom of his parents. That kinda made me become a little wary since those types of stories have either one of those things. It has the most cheesiest plot ever invented to how the main character becomes turn around and becomes therightfull ruler in his fathers eyes or just keeps behaving like a spoiled child to the end of the anime until he finally realises hes wrong. This anime fortunately didnt either one. Characters i will go back to but story wise thats just a summary that its not that bad. The story was better than i would expect with great battles and good tactics shown in the entire series. It kinda reminds me of how Game of thrones could be without needed to put  sex , dragons or boobs in. It has its own style that defines it and it takes it time not pushing anything to far and it doesnt rush past what should have been. Eventhough i say all is well with it there are cheesy parts i felt like they could have made alot more brutal and could have needed some evil ish scenes. \\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound both feels nice and fits with the movie the opening is a much watch even if you dont watch the anime since its that addictive. \\n\\n\r\nAlas we come to characters. Yes it has it share of interesting characters and i dare tell you if anyone comes to me telling how  overpowered someone is here that thats the clear definition of not having watched it. Specially the main character hes probably one of the weakest battle and skill wise i have ever seen. He follows mostly what people tells him to and he lacks any form of planning and yes this is the to be King. Not being overpowered or too strong is one thing but the only good thing this guy have going for him is his faith in everyone who walks up to him. Naivity has a name and thy name is Arslan. The rest of the characters have a more interesting variation but i give the characers 6 because some of them just doesnt feel in any way much original. \\n\\n\r\nI learned to enjoy it after watching 4 episodes since before that i wanted to throw the main character down a pit and tip boulders down the pit. The battles and scenes are well made, many of the characters can be called good fitting the story but its just good for me nothing more. It doesnt have that factor alot of other anime has. It has its own feel but not so high that it deserves any higher then 7. \\n",

            "content": "Arslan has a great premise with a medieval setting thats hard not to like but its like a bowl of boring pasta without the chilli sauce. . . ye get me. . .\r\nThe Heroic legend of Arslan or Arslan senki was first a fantasy novel series by Yoshiki Tanaka and was later adapted to manga a second time with illustrations by Hiromu Arakawa. So thats what got adapted to anime in 2015.\r\nIts a story about a naive kid prince who is fated to be a ruler. His comrades appreciate what his ideals are but also know that things wont be so easy,  loyalties growstronger as the prince slowly walks down a righteous path to true royalty and becomes a true king of the people. . .  Well i think thats whats up...\\n\\n\r\nAfter looking at the 2015 spring anime chart i thought daymn arslan has some competition, will it be one of the good ones?\\n\r\n            What i like. I like the kids development. . . He starts off annoying me but as the end of the series drew near i thought he was becoming someone i could watch another season of. The supporting characters are needed with these kind of mains and they do pretty good. Narsus's strategy, Daryun's strength all to important when i guess, raising this kid into a ruler.\\n\r\n             I thinks this is the lightest this show will be. . . what i mean is that a darker under story is all to evident in the first season and it staying as light hearted as the first season, is unlikely and thank god for that, we need a  darker undertone so that the gravity of his ordeals aren't forgotten the next day. \\n\r\n          I like the villain. . . he has his own ordeals and some of mystery. I see him becoming good at the end, realising his path was broken from the start.\\n\\n\r\nI didnt like arslan at the beginning but was happy i stuck with him because he does grow on you. His character is kind of bland in the beginning and slowly he gets more interesting as he grows up with these awesome support characters.\\n\r\n         My biggest problem was the lack of oomphf of this series i get that its political at times and they do that in a way where im not sleeping through dialogue, so nice one i guess but comparing this to other 2015 spring anime the edge was not there.\\n\\n\r\nDo i recommend Arslan Senki? Ye i do, its a mellow ride that i enjoyed. Might be because im a fan of war stories, strategy and a ruler thats for the people or it could of been because i was playing total war and wanted a story similar to what i was doing, either way i rated this quality viewing. .  . \\n",

The plot itself is pretty direct and there are not much twist, which can be a good thing as it keeps the viewer on track and the easiness to grab the message the creator is trying to convey. \r\nThe winning point for this anime is definitely its characters. Character development is pretty decent , and most of them are like-able even withantagonists. Daryunn and Narsus are amazingly done and written. One represents the mind and the other the sword of the MC, Arslan, guiding him through the hardships if warfare and to succeed as a ruler of a kingdom\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this is a enjoyable anime if one is interested in military affairs, as it greatly stresses on war strategies and the values of being a great ruler.",

            "content": "**this review will contain minor spoilers**\r\nYoshiki Tanaka, you may not recognize his name but you've undoubtedly heard of his highly acclaimed behemoth Legend of the Galactic Heroes; a seminal war epic that influenced many series in its wake, with a legacy that still ripples through the world of anime and manga to this very day. When I heard that another one of his creations were going to get the anime treatment with Arslan Senki, my interest was immediately piqued. I was expecting another grand series with rich themes of political warfare, larger-than-life moments littered throughout and a far-reaching cast of developed personalities to carry itthrough. I was expecting a show that handled its content with a sense of gravitas, leaving no room for shortcuts. I was expecting something with a discipline, where proper writing and coordinated planning wasn't just an afterthought. And as if to solidify the deal even further, I found out that the character design work and manga adaptation of Tanaka's work was done by Arakawa Hiromu of Fullmetal Alchemist fame. The person behind one of the greatest war epics of all time partnered up with the person responsible for what's arguably one of, if not, the best shounen of all time. With such promising creators taking the helm, what could possibly go wrong?... Well, as it turns out, everything can. \\n\\n\r\nArslan Senki was an anime that attempted all of the qualities expected from a Yoshiki Tanaka work but done so with none of the nuance or tact. It's juvenile in presentation but takes things seriously, it relies on implausible scenarios but pretends to be strategic, and it reeks of abused literacy devices in substitution for proper storytelling. Arslan Senki was simply a war epic that wanted to wear big boy pants while still not knowing how to tie its own shoelaces. \\n\\n\r\nThe primary focus of Arslan Senki was a common tale that has been told many times over. A timid prince turned gallant leader slowly building his support and will to reclaim the throne that was stripped away from him. For all intents and purposes, the story itself was a coming-of-age just seen through the eyes of a more privileged individual. This isn't exactly a bad thing as long as the writing is solid. After being betrayed by factions within his own kingdom, Arslan, the crown prince of Pars, found himself fending for his life with everything around him being thrown into turmoil. This 1st season follows Arslan as he finds himself befriending new allies and growing out of his naivety with each new obstacle he's forced to encounter.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself was fine but the way it was handled was anything but. Writers often use characters within a story as plot devices to either move or manipulate the narrative to their liking. In order to make such an underhanded, yet necessary ploy less noticeable, the writers would evenly distribute the abilities or relevance among several characters, as a means to avoid turning any given individual into a Mary Sue/Gary Stu. So you can have a character who excels at X but not Y and vice versa. And while the set abilities and roles of the characters involved in Arslan were indeed separated, they only manage to avoid being Mary Sues/Gary Stus to only become HAX beyond probability instead. \\n\r\nNarsus was a HAX tactician to the point where no matter how unfathomable or detrimental the circumstances, he would asspull a strategy just in the nick of time to save everyone's asses. Daryun was a HAX warrior that made mincemeat out of hundreds of men with no visible signs of fatigue or any human tenancies to speak of. Gieve was simply HAX at life, as he seemingly found a way out of death flag territory time after time again with little in the way of proper explanation as to why. Falangies, for no God-given reason, turned into Trinity and walked through a barrage of arrows like she was auditioning for The Matrix. And finally, there was Arslan himself, a character that's so much of a goody-two-shoes, that if he was tossed into the Game of Thrones universe, he would have been dead in 5 minutes tops. There's being nice and then there's being unrealistically lenient, Arslan was the latter. He might as well be a Care Bear. \\n\\n\r\nThe implausibility of the characters wasn't the only problem that made itself apparent, the scenarios were equally as mentally challenging in that regard. To just name one example, we had a horse jump 20 feet into the air and landed a perfect mount onto a rampaging elephant to rescue someone at mid-gallop. And remember, this occurrence took place in a world that tried to be as realistic as possible. Something that felt inherently contradictory when the audience is shown actions akin to a Looney Tunes cartoon.\\n\\n\r\nThe show required a high suspension of disbelief to buy into it. It placed the characters up against impossible odds only for the outcome to always be the same. There's no struggle to become better. There's no uphill battle to the top. There's no fight that posed a challenge, despite the handicap they're constantly placed in. All that we ended up with was a HAX team of misfits that plowed through obstacles like they're the Justice League. When the outcome always manage to be the same, why bother to get invested? Trying my best to avoid comparisons here but this is why Legend of the Galactic Heroes is constantly held in such high regards. The outcome wasn't determined, both sides took causalities, suffered losses and had no jarring plot armor to speak of. It was relentless, it had tension, and it wasn't a one-sided victory. Arslan Senki never demonstrated any of these attributes and just ended up being too idealistic for its own good. \\n\\n\r\nAnother left-field issue that reared its ugly head was the random inclusion of magic midway through the series, which was up to that point, a \"realistic\" depiction of war. The show spent most of its duration trying to build a war drama where everything was grounded in reality but out of nowhere tossed in a new genre that was previously nonexistent. It single-handedly sabotaged its own foundation. This isn't like other medieval titles similar to Berserk, where there were foretelling signs of supernatural occurrences scattered throughout its runtime. No, Arslan never gave any indication whatsoever that magic would have worked its way into the narrative. The supernatural elements of Arslan just hits you like a Mack truck and if unprepared, can break any semblance of immersion that was established beforehand (that is, if you even had any immersion, to begin with). \\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation for the show were appalling, not only by modern standards but in general. There are titles in the mid-80s that show better fluidity and attention to detail than this. It doesn't even rise to mediocre status. Not even the inclusion of Arakawa Hiromu's character designs could save the numerous times the animators had inconsistent models. This was derp central folks! Picasso face pandemonium! Every time a character was presented at a different angle, the act of looking disturbingly off-putting was guaranteed. This was made even worse by the deplorable usage of CGI. It was breathtakingly bad, seeing hoards of CGI fodder soldiers, animals and other objects just plastered across landscapes with no effort to conceal them. I'm talking PS1 level graphics here. The kind of mismanagement expected from the early 2000s when CGI integration was still being played around with. It was truly a messy patch job, apathetically slapped together in a way that's too obvious to give it a pass. \\n\\n\r\nIf this anime had any saving graces, it would be in the music department. The show had grand sound to it that really helped in placing you in the middle of the action (even if the \"action\" was hoards of CGI dummies). The Iron Age vibe was captured quite well. The opening and ending themes were all pretty decent as well, and while not as important, even the cut-scene tapestries was a nice tough. None much of an auditory standout in its respective season but still serviceable nonetheless. And really, that's the bottom line with Arslan Senki as a whole, it's just serviceable but never becomes anything more. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Arslan Senki proved to be a challenging watch. It wasn't eye-candy, it wasn't smart and it was far from enthralling. What little it attempted to accomplish has been done better elsewhere to a much more successful degree \u2014 hell, almost everyone staffed to create this thing has a better version of this lying around. It barely managed to scrape by and when you take into consideration the creative minds behind the project, it's quite disheartening. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe show had a somewhat decent start but after a few episodes, what seemed like a sturdy foundation turned out to be a house of cards. I wanted to like this show but it kept on giving me reasons not to. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4.5/10\\n\\n\r\nArslan Senki was an overlooked title that has little to no hype behind it... and you know what? I hope it stays that way. Unrealistic to anyone paying attention to it and insulting to the eyes of anyone who watches it, Senki was an anime that had the backing of proven creators to become something great but spewed out a mishmash of bad ideas instead. It may have had good intentions but good intentions aren't enough to make a good anime.",

            "content": "When thinking about Arslan Senki, I tend to think of this show as a mixture of fantasy adventure, war drama, and a story that really emphasizes the journey of a young prince. Arslan Senki (The Heroic Legend of Arslan) is a show that chronicles more than just the making of a hero. It delivers a tale of adventure that should be remembered like a legend. For its themes and storytelling, I can safely say that this show is one hell of a ride.\r\nBased loosely on the novels and adapting the plot of the manga written by Yoshiki Tanaka, Arslan Senki is essentially a war story.In a role that requires more than larger than life dimensions, it is epic in an old-fashioned sense. And how does it achieve that? By its sheer ability to show its rich story.\\n\\n\r\nThe setting takes place in an alternative version of the Middle East. And from the beginning, we learn of a warring conflict that erupts between two factions \u2013 Pars and Lusitania. At a young age, we meet Arslan and he witnesses the reality of war; bloodshed, chaos, and death by the Lusitanian forces. The premise also establishes that Daryun, a former high ranking military officer gets acquainted with Arslan. The story then goes on to show the adventures of Arslan, Daryun, and others as they struggle to regain Pars. As with the way the premise sets up, there\u2019s a whole load of potential with its direction. In particular, there\u2019s character growth that really becomes evident for Arslan. In addition, we see character relationships that expands beyond just military acquaintances such as the relationship between Arslan and Daryun.\\n\\n\r\nIn the beginning though, we must first learn to understand who Arslan is. Thankfully, the pilot episode does just that as we see a young Arslan from the Kingdom of Pars deal with an escaped young kid. Turns out, the kid is a prisoner that escaped and is from the nation of Lusitania. The most important part however is his reasoning for hating slavery. In essence, the show prints an image into the audience\u2019s mind that conflicting ideologies can break out conflicts that leads to bloodshed, war, and death. It\u2019s also clearly evident that Pars and Lusitania have different views on social equality. In particular, religion and slavery become prominent aspects of inspiration for characters\u2019 motivations. I also have to give some praise for the show\u2019s ability to show its reality of war. It isn\u2019t shy to deliver violence when it comes to content. And by doing so, we can see how far some nations can go to get their message across.\\n\\n\r\nWhile essentially showing that Arslan is a na\u00efve young man, he is also known as the prince of Arslan. By holding such title, the people of Pars seems to hold a respect for him. In particular, we meet others that join him and Daryun along the way helps him in his quest to restore Pars. The journey they take involves obstacles while Arslan himself learns about different views of various countries and factions. For Arslan himself, the young man becomes more confident and even seems to be able to influence some others. His relationship with the people traveling with him demonstrates his loyalty and selflessness. In particular, Arslan and Daryun has a dynamic relationship as the two are nearly inseparable. There\u2019s a mutual feeling of respect the two holds for one another and Arslan treats him like a friend rather than a soldier. In his group, Arslan has a diverse range of characters. There\u2019s Narsus who plays the role of a tactical genius as well as Elam who serves him while developing a respect for Arslan himself. Joining them is Farangis, a priestess archer with a cold yet courageous attitude. We also meet Gieve, a traveling musician and curious adventurer with an infatuation towards Farangis. All these characters come from different backgrounds but forms a group to fulfill Arslan\u2019s ambitions. Throughout their journey, we learn more about each of them individually while characterizing their roles to define their finest moments. In retrospect, they also bring out the best of Arslan\u2019s character as he leads them with a solid ambition.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that stands out about the writing of the story is that each episode adds more and more to the bigger plot. While there is some pacing issues at times, it never derides from the premise. We see the journey that Arslan undertakes towards Pars while also witnessing the political and wartime affairs that they face. The obstacles Arslan encounters are met with various results almost each time but we always learn something new about their world. While the show isn\u2019t always able to capture the interest of the audience, it does present it in a way that is clever in terms of story development. Along the way, we also meet Silver Mask, a character that serves as the antithesis of Arslan. He is cruel, bloodthirsty, and prideful with an intent to capture the throne of Pars himself. As leader of the Luistania army, there\u2019s a sharp contrast between him and Arslan\u2019s personality. Almost each time he is shown on screen, there\u2019s ruthlessness that is enforced as Silver Mask stops at nothing to achieve his goal. What does this tell about such an antagonist? It means that Arslan has a huge obstacle that he must overcome in order to prove himself as a worthy prince.  \\n\\n\r\nThe world fiction of Arslan Senki is fantastic. Although labeled as a fantasy adventure, there\u2019s little actual fantasy elements that is adapted with the story. It exists though. There are a few instances when magic is presented but the war story elements of the series is what stands out the most. The Kingdom of Arslan is also well structured with impressive architectural design to give off its resourceful feeling. Similarly, Luisitania is a place of prosperity that can easily be seen with their welfare. Later on in the show, we are also introduced to the kingdom of Sindra with interesting aspects of its own alongside its cast of prominent characters.\\n\\n\r\nFor everything that Arslan Senki does right, there are also some parts that can be forgettable. In particular, the comedy sometimes feels a bit oddly timed. While it\u2019s mostly tolerable, there\u2019s a bit of repetitiveness going on. Some of the supporting characters are also easily forgettable with what they have to offer. Not to mention, a few of them are stereotypical with their ideologies; in particular the antagonists. The romance aspect of the show is also quite stale as Gieve tries to hopelessly win the heart of Faraganis while being rejected every time. Later on, Narsus attracts the attention of a young girl that becomes a bit of an annoyance for him and the audience. Finally, the plot of Arslan Senki may not be for everyone. While I personally enjoy the direction of the story, patience may be tested for some viewers as the pacing isn\u2019t entirely stellar. In addition, Arslan is a character that people may or may not like depending on personal preferences. If you don\u2019t believe me, just ask Silver Mask himself.\\n\\n\r\nUnquestionably, there\u2019s a familiarity with the character designs. Anyone who has seen Full Metal Alchemist would know this from first glance as Arslan looks like Edward Elric in terms of physical resemblance. After all, the character designs are based on the Hiromu Arakawa\u2019s version of the manga for its adaptation. In essence, the character designs are fitting for someone like Arslan. He is young with his signature silver hair, compassionate personality, and resilient youth. On the other hand, there\u2019s Daryun who stands out as a warrior with his iron clad-like armor and signature spear. In fact, almost everyone in Arslan\u2019s group stands out in some way whether it\u2019s Narsus\u2019 shoulder-length hair or Faraganis\u2019 fierce nature. While I\u2019m not a big fan of all the character designs, I do believe that Studio Lerche captured the intention of the manga when it comes to artwork. Additionally, we have cruel weapons the historical ages, war elephants, and other instruments of war with a decent degree of realism. Violence is no stranger to this show so expect some uncensored violence and blood to be spilled. However, what I give praise for is that Arslan Senki never goes overboard with its violent nature. It\u2019s just enough. And finally, the action is blockbuster hit that is hard to ignore and qualifies with classic moments.\\n\\n\r\nArslan Senki is also known for its breathtaking soundtrack. The war-like drama orchestra combined with the riveting nature of the show brings out each episode to life. The OP and ED theme songs are also memorable for its ability to tell a story just by its scenario of important scenes. However, the real strength comes from the voice actors and actresses. Each character demonstrates a personality that we can find fitting for their role. Whether it\u2019s Daryun\u2019s undying loyalty or Silver Mask \u2019s ruthlessness, it\u2019s very believable. Speaking of which, I had some doubts at first with Yuki Kaji playing the role of a main antagonist. However upon seeing Silver Mask\u2019s voice and role on screen, it\u2019s actually quite fitting.\\n\\n\r\nWhy should you watch Arslan Senki? In the end, it\u2019s up to perspective. If you\u2019re interested in a war story with interesting storytelling, strong characterization, and the journey of a prince, then you\u2019re in for a treat. Each episode expands on the story that keeps the audience wanting for more. Each episode shows us more about the characters that we want to know. And each episode captures the reality of war really is like in their world. Despite some concern with the comedy and pacing of the story, there is a lot of fun watching the show in the end.  It\u2019s not just about fighting to win a war but also making a difference for the young prince known to the world as Arslan.\\n",

My expectations for the story weren't really high especially have reading some of Kingdom (sorry low blow yeah I really should even mention Kingdom this is about Arslan Senki...) Anyway like said before the story is good but I did feel the pacing for episodes 17-23 could have been a bit better because I did indeed loose quite a lot of interesting in the semi-slice of life in a army they had going on during those episodes. Which is why Ipersonally can't give this an 8 so a 7.5 will do.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation (8/10) Very Good\\n\\n\r\nThe art is very good and the animation (at least for episode 24 that is was amazing) everything else as far as animation was either just good or sub par. It definitely wasn't really consistent when it came to animation and art style it would go from looking good to looking mediocre quite a few art style derps here and there but not on a Toei level. With that being said if the anime actually looked like what those still pictures looked like at the end of the first outro man it would have been amazing. The CG didn't bother me as is wasn't used too much.\\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10) Masterpiece/Outstanding\\n\\n\r\nNothing wrong in the sound department as the Openings and Endings are amazing well chosen for such a series, the voice actors were outstanding (JP VA) and the sound effects on weapons clashing sound real authentic. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8/10) Very Good\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Arslan Senki are very good also. With 25 episodes they did a good job fleshing out the cast and making everyone in the protagonist's group feel relevant and that's what you are suppose to do. Obviously Daryun stole the anime the dude is a best and he reminds me so much of Zhao Yun even their names kind of sound alike.. come to think of it Arslan reminds me of Liu Bei and Narsus of Zhuge Liang... hmmm maybe that's why I like them so much because I'm a giant ROTK fan.. anyway if those characters are inspired by those people it doesn't bother be because I loved them all.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10) Very Good\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment for this season of Arslan Senki was a roller coaster if I do say so myself. I'm not going to lie I wasn't excited every Sunday to quickly watch this anime because like I said around episodes 17-23 my interest was at an all time low to the point were I had to put it on semi-hold and let episodes pile up, because it just felt like when I watched 1 episode a week (as far as episodes 17-23 are concern) it kind of felt like i wasted my time. But episode 24 was amazing! BUT 17-23 at least to me was the least enjoyable...\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10) Very Good\\n\r\nMore Specifically (8.30/10)\\n\\n\r\nThere are multiple reasons why I chose to watch Arslan Senki when I first heard about an anime adaptation of this series was coming.\\n\r\n1) It's a war series and I apparently like those\\n\r\n2) The manga was drawn but the artist and mangaka of FMA so that stood out\\n\r\n3) The picture and character first shown when announced looked cool to me (yes that counts for something)\\n\r\nAnd just going off of those 3 things alone I wasn't disappointed by Arslan Senki I'm glad I chose this series and the end of this Season definitely left it inconclusive and a lot of openings for a second season. Hopefully it gets one because it deserves one.",

            "content": "The Heroic Legend of Arslan is an adventurous tale of how a young prince is driven out of his own kingdom, and how he must become a man worthy of leading his people to reclaim his kingdom. The whole series is about war and its stratagem. This show exceeded my expectations in several areas, which is why I felt compelled to write a review.\r\nStory:\r\nI want to start with the plot since it is what impressed me the most here. It is very rare to come across a historical and non-supernatural war anime that is this good. Each battle scene is carefully planned out. This isone of those series like NGNL or Log Horizon, where strategy is the most interesting thing about the story. But on top of that, there is plenty of revenge, betrayal, and other plot twists that keep the story\u2019s edge sharp. \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that impressed me about the plot was how well each episode was planned. There was never a single episode where I felt like I was wasting my time. I\u2019ll admit Arslan Senki has a rather slow story, like most war series. However, this is simply because it takes time to unravel every piece of the plot. The audience is offered several viewpoints from different angles so that no part of the story is overlooked. Even during the parts that are slow, each episode contributes to the plot and/or character development.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe characters are an important aspect to Arslan Senki. The character development of Arslan himself is very pertinent to the story. Prince Arslan is your typical heroic, young male MC: kind, gullible, easy to trick or manipulate, believes all people are good, hesitant to kill another human.\\n\\n\r\nThe other main characters in Arslan\u2019s fugitive travel party protect, advise, and counsel the Prince on his journey to find more loyal followers. They also teach him how to be a ruler worthy of leading his kingdom, while keeping his ideals intact. Arslan\u2019s relationships with his 5 loyal friends also develop throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation:\\n\r\nThe most notable point in this anime\u2019s art style is the detail of colorful Persian patterns. I often find my eyes fixated on the pattern of a character\u2019s clothing, a carpet, a wall tapestry, or other patterned things in the background. The color pallet of the artwork for this series fits well to the ancient Persian setting.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, as for the animation, there\u2019s one blinding CGI spoof in episode 1. Please don\u2019t judge the whole series. After that one mistake, the CGI is not disruptive anywhere else. Swordplay scenes are well done.\\n\\n\r\nSound & Music:\\n\r\nOP 1 and ED 1 are both superbly done. I didn\u2019t care as much for the second set of OP/ED.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is a very good fit to the setting and time period. The sound effects for each weapon are all accurate. And the voice acting fits well to the characters and setting too. \\n\\n\r\n-----\\n\\n\r\nArslan Senki has a few flaws here and there, so it really wasn\u2019t perfect. But it is still far above average. I consistently enjoyed watching the show each week throughout the season. If you are interested in watching a good war anime, I definitely recommend this one. Each episode of Arslan Senki was well worth watching the whole way through.",

            "content": "Prestigious parents often bear a burden of expectations for their children. Much to the doteful disappointment of the audience however, \u201cThe Heroic Legend of Arslan\u201d turns out to be something of a black sheep. Lovechild of original creators Yoshiki Tanaka (LOGH) and Hiromu Arakawa (FMA: B), Arslan shines a bright glow of mediocrity under the shadow of its peers. \r\nArslan bases itself on the manga, which in turn bases itself on the original novel, which at last takes inspiration from a loosely compiled set of Persian tales. If you weren\u2019t already familiar with the term \u201csuspension of disbelief\u201d, then you\u2019ll be quite capable by theend of the 25th episode. The story begins climatically as the \u201cundefeated\u201d king of Pars is defeated by the Lusistinian [European infidel] army after Pars is betrayed. Our titular main character, Arslan, is then thrust into seeking the crown because apparently, inexperience and innocence are signs of excellent leaders. Along the journey, Arslan attracts several companions who force the plot forward, exploiting an array of stupidly overpowered abilities. \\n\r\nIf this summary sounds somewhat familiar, it\u2019s because you\u2019ve already watched Akatsuki no Yona. As it turns out, \u201cthe King returns\u201d is hardly an original plothook. Arslan fails to differentiate itself from this association. Case in point, Arakawa goes as far as to replace Daryun\u2019s sword from the novel with a spear, in a direct parallel to Yona boyfriend #1. The most disappointing thing about Arslan\u2019s story however is not predictable plot structure, but rather the entire journey we take up to the final episode (queue 2nd season). When Arslan encounters problems, solutions are always in stock. Any meaningful consequences the story has to offer are whimsically avoided. The utter lack of tension stems from the fact that characters are never seriously threatened. This is fairly attributable to the abysmal performance of enemy soldiers, who switch on their autistic mode when faced with the slightest manifestation of \u201cenemy planning\u201d. Such mighty power seemingly retains divine superiority above all things, no matter how terrible the planning actually sounds. Antagonists rarely attempt to think of counter tactics, or even provide a contingency plan. There is little semblance of planning beyond the word \u201ccharge\u201d, as depicted by the Silver Mask who just cannot resist the opportunity to place himself in the most dangerous position possible, imitating the likes of Bronze LoL players. And even though they constantly outnumber Arslan\u2019s forces, there is never an attempt to use superior numbers to any tactical advantage whatsoever. In simpler terms, they demonstrate a consistently remarkable incompetency.\\n\r\nBut if tactical engagements become so predictable, then what does Arslan have left to surprise us? Magic, apparently. If you had any more than a sniffle of expectation for rationality left, then you\u2019re oft for a nasty awakening. Slightly more halfway through episode 12, xx_sketchy_pedo_assassin11_xx phases through the ground like a clipping ragdoll, staring menacingly at Daryun\u2019s behind before attacking [torpedoing] him. Just\u2026 why? Like many characters, magic exists solely because the writers were too lazy to provide coherent explanations for events in the story, shortcutting the pacing of plot progression. This has the added effect of cheapening out the audience\u2019s expectations. When it is revealed that the only reason Pars even lost in the first episode was because of \u201cmagic\u201d, Arslan\u2019s entire premise falls apart. Given how ridiculous most of the non-magical events in the anime already are, there doesn\u2019t seem to be much difference.\\n\\n\r\nThe prime instigator for the intellectually-triggering planning is Narsus, Arslan\u2019s near-omnipotent advisor. The party constantly relies on Narsus to deal with nearly every possible situation. Need tactical genius? He draws out half-baked bat-shit strategies and maneuvers like they were Yu-Gi-Oh cards. Political know-how? He may have only had court experience for a few years, but he acts the part of a cunning court wife. Family man? Somehow, this guy finds the time halfway through the series to pick up some random hobo broad. Definitely one of the less-human characters. \\n\r\nDaryun serves as Narsus\u2019s \u201cDynasty Warrior\u201d-esque counterpart, rescuing Arslan himself countless times. He goes beyond the physically impossible, as in episode 12 where he blitzes through time and space, bullet-timing several eurocucks in order to save the prince [princess] from xx_sketchy_pedo_assassin11_xx. I took a few moments to laugh at how ridiculous this shit looked when I saw it, but then I realized that they no longer had any intention of making Daryun even vaguely human. Yona at the very least justifies boyfriend #1 by pitting his efforts against attractive dragon boys. The only time Darius even appears to struggle is during his fight against the giant, where Darius appeared to be on the verge of defeat. Or at least, until we learn that he was faking effort all along so he could one-shot his opponent. Again.\\n\r\nGieve and Falangies serve little purpose beyond filling in as niche solutions to problems, what with Gieve\u2026 being there, and Geese inflicting Stormtrooper-level aiming at will (not that they would have hit anything anyway). Gieve constantly attempts to woo her in an effort at comedy relief, but their relationship doesn\u2019t get any deeper than the surface. Beyond that, I fail to understand why they even exist in the show.  \\n\r\nIt\u2019s precisely because of the swiss-knife efficiency of his party that Arslan himself undergoes minimal growth all throughout the series. The constant coddling reduces him to the role of \u201cfigurehead king\u201d. His first foray into battle actually seems to inspire PTSD in him, as he deals with the horror of slaying a man- Or so you\u2019d think. A few episodes later, he\u2019s back to happily sniping down cavalry. Likewise, he gives minimal thought to his companion\u2019s continuous slaughter of men, instead opting to save his compassion to slaves. In fact, Arslan bases the majority of his motivation for kingship on the abolishment of slavery. In the same manner as post American civil-war, he eventually learns that simply removing slavery does not always make a happy slave- Or so you\u2019d think. Towards the end, he proceeds to announce his intention to eradicate slavery without bothering to plan for an afterwards\u2026 But that\u2019s okay since his companions are so terribly OP he never truly needs to learn from his mistakes. This ignorance appears to be something of superior monarchal quality however, since it is the only reasoning his companions provide when asked why they serve Arslan. A truly remarkable display of loyalty. \\n\r\nOf special note is Etoile, a fanatical tsundere crusader who\u2019s given a chance to rise above the communal pit of shame. Her kidnaping-adventure with a young Arslan is what first inspires him to reassess Pars\u2019s slavery, later serving as justification for seeking the crown. Their third meeting performs likewise, spurring excellently reasonable motivation in our timid prince. He finally begins to somewhat confidently takes the role of decision-maker; a quality lacking throughout the rest of the series. It seems that out of all the characters in Arslan, Etoile is the only one that doesn\u2019t pamper or take advantage of him. There is an attempt at backstory in the second half, but sadly, it is rushed over quickly and reduced to nonimportance.\\n\\n\r\n\tAlthough sound design is not a common aspect of discussion, the usage of JoJo-like sound effects in combat is very overt. Scenes depicting heavy impacts are accompanied by a blearing amount of bass. What works in JoJo should, nevertheless, stay in JoJo. It sounds terribly misused in an anime that struggles to convey justification, instead suggesting that it merely exists to sound \u201ccool\u201d.  \\n\r\nDespite sharing Brotherhood\u2019s character design, Arslan\u2019s general art and animation is a far flung fantasy of a comparison. The opening battle introduces us to a use of CGI that is heavily parodied by modern cinema. An ineffectually zooming camera cuts across a blob-like engagement between two factions of generic, faceless soldiers for an inordinate period of time. This use of clay-soldiers seemingly holds true for any fight that involves large groups. Suffice to say, it is quite ugly. 2D horse animations are frequently terrible, closely mirroring the infamous \u201cquality\u201d horse animation in Spice and Wolf. For a series that sees fit to utilize horses in every single battle, you\u2019d think that they\u2019d have at least put some effort into this regard. \\n\r\nBattle choreography is similarly held in lesser regard. Characters often show little understanding of any martial technique that isn\u2019t a left or right slash when using swords. In fact, Gieve in episode eleven parries the same exact L/R pattern THREE times in a row, a brilliant example of what it might be like to fight Kirito\u2019s mook reincarnation. There are of course, two exceptions to this. In the first OP, animator Satoshi Kimura (probably him) makes excellent use of 3D backgrounds in the Daryun vs Silver Mask duel to incorporate a rotating 360 degree shot around the fight, an innovative technique that not nearly enough animators take advantage of. The penultimate episode\u2019s fight (once again featuring Darius and Edgelord) similarly excels. After whiffing his thrust, Daryun gores into a pillar, lodging his blade deeply into the structure. But instead of trying to free his blade, he gouges across the fucking thing into a follow-up horizontal swing. This no-fucks personality painted by animation certainly doesn\u2019t come across when all we see is character mindlessly one-shotting mass produced soldiers for several episodes.\\n\\n\r\n\tIn the end, perhaps you could say that this particular heroic legend just wasn\u2019t the kind for me. You could go on to suggest that warfare was never a crucial element to the story, and that perhaps, the emphasis of Arslan should be based on its portrayal of woefully ignorant royalty identifying problems within his Kingdom\u2019s internal practices, and going on both a physical and figurative journey to his maturity. But no matter how deficiently optimistic you choose to put it, Arslan never intended itself to be something great. Instead, Arslan basks quite happily in the rays of averageness, and we contentedly conclude that there really shouldn\u2019t have been much to expect anyway.",

I have a love for medieval style anime (the genre of medieval in general as a matter of fact), and I enjoy fight scenes. Arslan Senki gave me so much of that. \r\nPrince Arslan went through a time of maturation and development that you could progressively see throughout the entire series andyou were rooting for him along the way. I hope there is a season 2 and I will continue reading the manga. I hope the video game comes here to the States. If you haven't seen Arslan Senki, I highly recommend you do.",

            "content": "As someone who is a big fan of fantasy, Arslan Senki was right up my alley and it did not disappoint me. \r\nI wasn't expecting to enjoy it as much as I did, to be honest. The first episode was kind of 'meh' for me, but I stuck with it, and by the second episode I was like a ravenous beast; I needed more, more, more. I caught up on the show that day and watched weekly after that.\r\nWhat I enjoyed most was the moral compass this series is guided by, or rather, Arslan is. He's a just, fair young man with a very goodhead on his shoulders. His growth from a rather wimpy kid who only knows what he's been taught to someone who sees the world without judgement in the sense that if he disagrees with it, it isn't automatically seen as \"the wrong thing\", he just doesn't agree. \\n\\n\r\nYou can't help but root for Arslan as he starts his journey with Daryun, Narcissus and the others to reclaim Pars after it has fallen to Lucetania, because you want to know what kind of leader Arslan has it in him to be. \\n\\n\r\nEach character has the remarkable capacity for growth, and they do. Arslan's company grows to the point where if you were to place the old them and the new them beside each other, the differences would be stark. I love that, and in a series like this, surrounded by war and politics and religion, it's definitely necessary.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was phenomenal as well! Honestly, I think that's one of my favourite things, aside from the characters. The way everything was animated was simply gorgeous. \\n\\n\r\nThe music, also, was grand. It helps sweep you up into the moment. With each swell of the music, you're left sitting on the edge of your seat. What's going to happen? What's going on? Honestly the composer should receive some kind of reward for this. They capture the show beautifully in their music.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly now that I'm finished, I want to go back and watch it all again. I adore this anime and I can't wait for the second season. 2016 can't come fast enough!",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nThis introduction is difficult for me because I have no experience with war. Sure, I have historical knowledge, but I have never taken part in violence of that magnitude. I do not seek out confrontations, instead I seek out calm. I prefer friends over fights as it were. That is just who I am.\r\nI therefore must rely on the words of others here, rather than my own. There are a lot of famous phrases about war. \u201cWar. What is it good for? Absolutely nothing.\u201d A famous lyric sung by Edwin Starr. \u201cWar. War never changes.\u201d Aniconic statement of the Fallout video game franchise. \u201cWar is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength.\u201d Irony of monumental proportions, written by George Orwell and taken from his classic 1984. Each medium \u2013 from music to games to literature \u2013 thinks the same simple thought: war is always bad.\\n\\n\r\nAt least, that is how the vast majority of people think nowadays. Go back far enough, and you will discover that war was often the norm. Arslan Senki sits in this latter camp, portraying war, succession, and politics in anime form. Whether or not the show delivers a solid performance, though, is still up for debate.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nArslan Senki sets itself up as a prolonged adventure. A lot goes on, and a lot has yet to happen. Still, the anime covers a lot of ground in its first season, from big themes to involved battles. Again, there is a lot of plot left to get through, and while the show could be in a better spot the anime is not outright horrible either.\\n\\n\r\nThe narrative clearly states the end numerous times. \u201cAnd thus, the boy would become king\u201d and the title of the show The Heroic Legend of Arslan \u2013 where legend implies an immense level of fame achieved through exploits and success \u2013 spell out a complete win for Arslan. Thus, what matters is not where the plot ends up but how the plot gets there. What makes up the majority of the plot is the demonstration of war. Swinging swords, strategizing against the enemy, and the before-and-after effects. That last point is important because the downtime is where the show puts the most attention on its larger ideas.\\n\\n\r\nThese themes are heavy. War. Slavery. Religion. Arslan Senki targets ideas that are wide in scope and are therefore a bigger challenge to explore properly. The first two more or less see adequate development, especially war and its misgivings. War brings more than just death; war brings betrayal, camaraderie, fear, suffering, and understanding, all of which the narrative shows time and again. From the sacking of Ecbatana to the victory at Saint Emmanuel, the byproducts of war are interlaced throughout the experience. Slavery likewise plays a prominent role. Slaves\u2019 mistreatment, Ecbatana\u2019s fall, Narsus\u2019s background, Arslan\u2019s relationship to his people, and Kashan\u2019s persuasion are each examples of the ways in which slavery is explored, remaining relevant for much of the season. For both of these themes on war and slavery, the anime also manages to include the grotesque sides. Displaying the severed head of a traitor and the killing of captives proved that the show was not afraid to venture into the more unsightly aspects of these themes.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, the anime missteps with its religious theme. In the beginning, Yaldabaoth and the idea of conflicting ideologies has a major role in how the plot proceeds. The overzealous nation of Lusitania demolishes the powerhouse that is Pars because of their devotion to their god. Following the opening arc, however, religion is pushed to the wayside. The concept of religion is brought up later on with Hermes who denounces religion as nothing more than a farce, but a huge chunk of the plot ignores religion and its influence on not just the events but also its other themes on war and slavery. Of course, Falangies and Estelle are characters whose very traits revolve around religion, but they are not prominent enough within the narrative to add weight to this important idea.\\n\\n\r\nArslan Senki has an even bigger glaring problem in its narrative that is best described as a plot contrivance. Specifically, the enemy\u2019s dark sorcery is the home for too much convenience. Besides Falanngies\u2019s apparent ability to communicate with the Djinn, the anime almost entirely focuses on the believable aspects of war. Horses, castles, and spears make up the vast majority of the content. The tiny sliver that does not encompass the realm of the real is the evil magic that Hermes has at his disposal. This ally of his can materialize from the portals he makes, he can traverse quickly over land, and he can even bring others through the darkness.\\n\\n\r\nSimply incorporating this into the show automatically introduces potential issues. One, the bad guys can be saved whenever the show chooses \u2013 this happens near the end of this season. Two, the bad guys can appear whenever the show chooses \u2013 this happens during the splitting-up in the mountains as the troupe heads for Peshawar. Third and lastly, the bad guys can kill Arslan whenever the show chooses \u2013 this never happens but that is exactly the issue. For instance, in the final fight between Arslan and Estelle, the darkness not appearing to eliminate the young prince, despite him being alone and despite him fighting for his life, makes little logical sense given the anime\u2019s overall context. Granted, this dark sorcery is used quite sparingly. But this is still an unfair crutch that removes natural progression of the plot and instead favors a tool that artificially pushes the narrative where Arslan Senki needs it to go.\\n\\n\r\nAnother minor grievance is the anime\u2019s unwillingness to remove key players. It is fair to assume that Arslan, Daryun, and Narsus would continually live following each encounter. Arslan is the main protagonist and both Daryun and Narsus are vital to the crown prince\u2019s success. However Falangies, Gieve, Elam, Jaswant, and Alfreed, characters who are by and large not that important to earning Arslan\u2019s glory, are barely affected. The same can also be said of the enemy. Other than Kharlan (who died early) and Hermes (who is the main antagonist), Bodin, Xandes, and Guiscard are figures that still have a presence despite not doing much or meaning much to the narrative. Given Arslan Senki\u2019s penchant for war, not having any of these heroes or villains eliminated reduces the believability the show strives for. Again, to be fair, this is the first season of the series, meaning it is entirely possible that some of the aforementioned characters will perish in due time. But when the only truly harrowing moment is when Elam is wounded protecting Arslan, and even then the wound is not as life threatening as it could be, the narrative once again comes off as unfairly guided rather than naturally progressing.\\n\\n\r\nSimilarly and seemingly unnatural is, at first glance, the Sindhura arc. However that entire ordeal centers on three concepts. One, bolstering the credentials of Arslan. Joining ranks with another country and staying loyal to this country demonstrated his abilities as a trustworthy leader, giving him the necessary clout to establish his decrees. Two, recruiting Jaswant into his party. While much happens during this arc, one of the most important aspects is having Jaswant join Arslan\u2019s gang as further proof of his trustworthiness and his ability to unite disparate people. Three, the conflict is representative of Arslan\u2019s battle against Hermes. The clashing brothers, the power struggle, and the throne succession questions, combined with the capabilities of those rulers and their relationship to their father, mirror Arslan\u2019s own difficulties abroad. This in turn gives Arslan the chance to understand that birthright is not all that is needed to become king.\\n\\n\r\nYet this arc introduces an inherent problem: displacement of focus. While these qualities of this portion of the narrative are intentional and purposeful, this long stretch of episodes takes away from the main point of contention, namely Pars, Ecbatana, and Hermes. For a time, Arslan Senki becomes less about Arslan and his fight to win the throne and more about this aside that, ultimately, means very little to the grander goals at play.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime has other positives. The season ends on a total victory for Arslan, achieving a full-circle framing for the narrative that brings about a sense of closure to his initial defeat. The anime also has other negatives. The anime fails to give competent world-building. Other rival countries, terrain traversed, and societal life are barely investigated. Altogether, the anime does not entirely miss the mark with its narrative but there is definitely room for improvement.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nWhere Arslan Senki falters hardest is in its art and its animation.\\n\\n\r\nTo clarify, the anime\u2019s character designs are partially exempt from most of the issues. Most notable are their \u201ccrispness\u201d, the defined outlines and vibrant colors of the characters heavily contrasting with the backgrounds they find themselves on. The paleness of Falangies and Arslan, the intricate outfits of Alfreed and Daryun, and the striking eyes of Jaswant and Gieve make them almost pop out of the screen, their looks alone defining them. However their designs are more than just visually pleasing, holding symbolic purpose as well. Arslan\u2019s white hair symbolizes his innocence as a child and purity as a leader. Furthermore, his androgynous depiction is a clever way to highlight that Arslan is a ruler representing everyone. Daryun dons black armor, black representing strength and power, both of which the knight carries in spades. And Narsus\u2019s comparatively lackluster appearance actually reflects his deceptive nature; he does not stick out like everyone else, making perfect sense for the genius strategist. This type of analysis can be applied to each character, proving the strength of each of their designs.\\n\\n\r\nThe same kind of strength cannot be attributed to the rest of the anime\u2019s artistic and animation direction. There are three big problems with the art. First, the main setting. The mountains, the plains, and the forests inherently provide dull stages for the actors to use. Indeed, watching a bunch of rocks or seeing the group traverse through dense foliage is not the most impressive sight. Arslan Senki attempts to switch things up with the occasional fortress or encampment, but the majority of the show finds itself on the boring side of life. This problem stems from the second: the frequent battles. Due to the war theme, these mountain passes, open fields, and trees are needed because that is where war normally takes place. So while the places are not too enticing, their inclusion is forced. The battles, in turn, introduce the third problem: the CG. By far the worst aspect of the art is the CG. Its blocky textures are a negative, but it is the reused sequences \u2013 soldiers with the exact same faces standing right next to one another or the same set of animations used, just with reskinned people \u2013 that truly hamper the anime. The reasoning for using as much CG as the show did was to combat (coincidentally) the battles. Their size and frequency ultimately meant that resources were spread thin, this lacking CG art and animation having to be relied on more so than wanted.\\n\\n\r\nConsequently, actual animation follows suit. Much of Arslan Senki has animation of a level that is not what one would consider favorable. It is not just the calmer times, where the characters talk with one another without too much hair or body movement. The battles likewise see a downgrade. The camera often pans high to give a lot without showing too much action. The camera zooms in a lot, too, swords, bows, and halberds used but without finesse or choreography. Combined, the anime never really shows extensive fighting, resulting in less overall animation. The actual animation peaks during the first fight between Daryun and Hermes. The rest of the show, however, tends to keep most objects and people from moving too much. Again, the anime is not devoid of animation, but given the focus on war and battles \u2013 alongside the questionable CG work \u2013 the amount provided is sorely less than appropriate.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nArslan Senki is a classic case in anime when it comes to a singular main character and the many side characters that support him or her. In question form, how much is \u201cenough\u201d for the supporting cast?\\n\\n\r\nRealistically, nobody else matters besides Arslan. This is a story about the young boy, so do the side characters really matter that much? Daryun, Narsus, Falangies, Elam, Alfreed, Gieve, and Jaswant constantly surround the young prince, but this is not their story. As such, many of these characters have very little known about them. Falangies in particular gets the brunt end of the stick; she has zero noteworthy scenes, and outside of her temple disciple background and her ability to hold her liquor, nothing else worthwhile is known about her. She effectively sits on the sidelines making a comment or two during this initial tale. So it begs the same question as before, does having so little about specific characters negatively impact the show\u2019s execution when all that matters is Arslan?\\n\\n\r\nA difficult question to answer because that line in the sand is not definitive. For example, Jaswant is arguably the best of the side characters: the audience learns of his background, the audience witnesses his intriguing and parallel relationship to Arslan, and the audience eventually understands the Sindhuran\u2019s own convictions. Daryun, on the other hand, is the \u201cBlack Knight\u201d of unparalleled strength with an equal amount of devotion to Arslan. But the viewer does not learn anything else about him. His background is never shown, he seemingly has no flaws, and his relationships except to those of Arslan and Narsus are rarely expounded on. All of these problems, yet he was next to Arslan since the very beginning of their journey. Most of the supporting cast are somewhere between Jaswant and Daryun in terms of strength. Alfreed gets multiple venues of motivation, Gieve more or less tags along, and so on. Again, expecting extensive development for the entire cast is a fruitless endeavor. But to focus on each of them so minimally as Arslan Senki did?\\n\\n\r\nOf course, similar to Jaswant, there are other exceptions. Hermes stands as a wonderful antagonist, even if the narrative unfairly uses him as it sees fit. As Arslan\u2019s foil in more ways than one, Hermes is a man whose rage knows no bounds. Driven by revenge, the former king\u2019s son does not want the throne so much as he wants his cousin\u2019s and his uncle\u2019s head, doing whatever it takes \u2013 such as murdering his own people or betraying those he has joined \u2013 to achieve his ends. He is scarily powerful, maniacal, and technically in the right. His family was killed and his home was taken for yet-to-be-fully-revealed reasons, so his actions are not entirely unfounded. Still, this burning desire to kill those who have wronged him drives everyone away. This contrasts heavily with Arslan, whose behavior naturally draws people to him. However this fiery rage also symbolizes Hermes\u2019s eventual downfall. His one weakness are flames, caused by the trauma of his family\u2019s original slaughter. This fact alone makes Hermes a well-rounded character simply because he is not infallible just as Arslan is. For now, it remains to be seen if Hermes can be saved or if his inner fire will consume him, but as it stands Lord Silver Mask is not just a worthy opponent for the crown prince but also one of the strongest characters of the cast.\\n\\n\r\nEstelle (disguising herself as Etoile) is also worth mentioning. Initially the audience is introduced to a boy whose belief in his ideals pushes him where he needs to go. When Arslan and the boy grow up, the two meet again, only to part ways still butting heads. For a time, it appears that the boy no longer has a spot among the cast until the show reveals that he is not a he but a she. Estelle infiltrates Arslan\u2019s keep to inspire him unintentionally (once again), she inadvertently causes the fall of the Keep of Saint Emmanuel, and she, oh so slightly, begins to expand her narrow-mindedness. Arslan has a unique relationship with the girl; while mutual feelings of romance have yet to bloom (a guess, since a king needs a queen and the narrative is screaming for it to happen), the pair hold different approaches to the same ideas of life. Similar to Hermes and the rest of the cast, she has yet to fully develop as a character. But as is the norm with the first season\u2019s characters, she is poised for greatness later on down the road.\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair towards everyone that is not Hermes or Estelle, some leniency is warranted. This is only the first season of the anime. A second season is on the horizon and will, presumably, be a two-cour show as well. Meaning these separate problems \u2013 Falangies forgotten about or Daryun hardly experiencing hardship \u2013 will most likely be addressed later on. So for now, it is not that absurd to assume that the characters will get the attention they deserve in due time. That is, the first season essentially gave us the characters and their respective characterizations (however slight they might be) in preparation for their eventual growth in the coming season.\\n\\n\r\nAssuming much of the side cast can be overlooked, at the minimum it is then fair to expect Arslan to carry more weight than considered normal. Therefore, and keeping in mind the split seasons, the final question, how does Arslan fair as a character at this point? He started as a wimp. Na\u00efve of the world beyond the capital\u2019s walls, his first taste of war is utter defeat. He sees his friends die, his subjects perish, and his father taken in the span of an evening. Obviously unable to do much of anything by his lonesome, he enlists Daryun who directs him to Narsus, and there the true adventure begins. Along the way, Arslan gains more followers, usually of different creeds. A former slave, a bard, and a nomad are but a sampling of the people that pledge themselves to Arslan.\\n\\n\r\nTheir variety is precisely what gives Arslan his edge. He is not incredibly strong like Daryun. He cannot wield a bow like Falangies. He cannot cook meals like Elam. But what Arslan can do is lead. A leader is not someone who can annihilate his foes or has immeasurable riches. A leader is someone who gains the utmost trust of those he leads. Arslan does this through his kind heart, his empathetic nature, and his reliance on others. That last part is important because that is exactly what Daryun, Narsus, and the rest do. They might not change but they support, and in turn morph, Arslan into the kind of king he will need to become. Arslan is far from that conclusion, but in the short span of time he has fought to earn his rightful spot on the throne he, like Hermes and Estelle before him, is more than ready for what lies ahead.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, those previous questions will always remain heated points of contention. But for Arslan Senki, Hermes, Estelle, and Arslan do more than enough (this season) to overlook the lack of support for the supporting characters.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe first opening theme mixes rock and acoustics, providing a sound that simultaneously does and does not fit the atmosphere of the anime. The combination is weird but the strangeness gives the piece some much needed \u201coomph\u201d. The fast lyrics, alongside the adrenaline-filling instruments and back-and-forth vocals, also give the piece a certain allure that works to get the audience in the mindset needed for the show. The second OP takes a similar approach, but less determined and more emotional in its presentation. Unfortunately, only the repetition in the middle and end is memorable, the rest of the piece a cacophony of sound and lyrics as opposed to a coherent piece of music.\\n\\n\r\nIt is not until the first ending theme is heard that the true formidability of the music is heard. The incredible vocalist, the mood-setting instruments, and the beat of the track propel the piece away from \u201cjust another ED\u201d to \u201can ED worth remembering\u201d. Even the simple \u201cah\u201d as the song concludes demonstrates the power contained within. The only problem with the first ED is that it gave way to the second which is, understandably, a step down. True to Kalafina form, the track is both mysterious and grand in scope, a nice fit for the direction of the anime. The women both share and trade the spotlight, turning the piece into a swirling harmony of singing that is soothing on the ears (also true of most Kalafina pieces). While not as strong as its previous ED, the second one does what it can to fill the first\u2019s shoes and at the minimum finds a decent spot among the legendary tale of Arslan.\\n\\n\r\nThe remainder of the soundtrack is often of orchestral origins. Resounding drums, deep violins, and sharp trumpets are heard, perfect for that feeling of war. Given the Western and European setting, many of the pieces also incorporate vibes of a similar nature. Stringy guitars and simple flutes place the audience in the correct location and time period without coming off as overbearing. Other tracks are mysterious, violins and harps cloaking the viewer in a veil of the unknown, such as when Hermes visits Andragoras. Other tracks are lighter, such as when Arslan has his new troops trained, soft pipes uplifting the mood. And although the OST does not contain any noteworthy pieces, they do their job nicely enough throughout the season.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, voice acting in Arslan Senki sees about average performances overall. Wataru Hatano as Jaswant uses a surprisingly deep voice that works quite well. Yuusuke Kobayashi as Arslan is relatively new to the field, his childish voice a bit too kiddy for the king-to-be. And Shirou Saitou as Bodin is supposed to sound furious but instead sounds like he needs to clear his throat.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nPart of the reason why I was not liking this one as much as I probably should have is the characters. Falangies is beautiful but so little was given about her she was not that enticing. Gieve teasing Falangies was amusing, but not that funny because that is all his person became. Narsus is intelligent but he is a rather dull person to see on-screen. Arslan likewise fails to leave a lasting impression. He is nice and gentle, but he does not really do anything throughout the season other than yell out names and continually learn from those around him. \u201cPresence\u201d is the right word; nobody in the cast had a presence that affected me. No one is cute or funny or cool. They are all just\u2026there. And to be fair, that kind of realness not only makes sense for the anime but also means a lot to other people. However I would have liked to have seen a teeny tiny bit more eccentricity, considering how flavorful everyone seemed. Hermes might count, but listening to him throw a hissy fit each time he made an appearance got old quickly.\\n\\n\r\nThere was one shining ray of hope that pierced my heart, though, and that was when Estelle revealed her true identity. Seeing her slightly smaller height-wise compared to Arslan, her boyish attitude compared to Arslan\u2019s girlish one, and the encounters they had in the past, immediately caught my attention, setting my romance-gears in motion. I always wondered if Arslan would find a lover, let alone who it might be. Falangies? She is an adult and he is a child. Alfreed? She has fallen for Narsus (Elam has a shot I believe). Tahamine? The time period makes such incestuous relationships not too farfetched but that would be out of left-field. Therefore Estelle is the one for Arslan. All I wanted from the moment they talked in the castle and in the prison cell was for the anime to continue to explore their complex relationship. Of course I knew (and know) that the anime was not (and is not) going to head full-force in that direction \u2013 this is an anime about war and Arslan\u2019s journey to become king, not some romantic-comedy. But the romantic in me yearns for more. As such, I remain hopeful for the upcoming continuation.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless of the characters and the potential romance, the other entertainment factor of Arslan is the fights. There is approximately a battle every other episode, be it a duel or a large-scale conflict. The show does its best to diversify each one: one skirmish uses fog to mask a trap, another still lures a battalion onto a thin sheet of ice to send them to a watery grave, and another involves stampeding elephants. Despite the show constantly changing tactics, I never once found myself emotionally invested in the anime. Perhaps it was because I \u201cknew\u201d that the show never had the guts to kill off any of the main cast, but I was never cheering for Daryun nor was I clapping as Narsus\u2019s plan worked flawlessly per usual. The fights were not boring per se, but as I was with the characters I was not invested in whatever the show happened to dish out.\\n\\n\r\nArslan Senki is the start of a journey, a start that got off on the semi-right foot. The characters are primed and ready to go and the music at times is easy on the ears. But the poor art and animation direction, combined with the less-than-stellar narrative, bring everything down further than the show would like. Hopefully the next iteration does not follow war\u2019s path and instead changes for the better.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fine, heavy themes of war and slavery, theme on religion forgotten, unwarranted plot contrivances, intriguing parallel narrative in the Sindhuran arc, and mixed structural decisions\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Bad, very nice character designs, poor artistic direction, and below average actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, while many of the supporting characters have yet to actually do much of anything they \u2013 alongside Hermes, Estelle, and Arslan \u2013 have promising starts\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fine, good first OP, bad second OP, fantastic first ED, good second ED, okay OST, okay VA performances\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Fine, an uninteresting cast, uninvesting battles, and a dash of potential romance provide a competently entertaining beginning to this tale\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 5/10",

            "content": "Arslan Senki is a truly great anime. I was hesitant to watch it when it released, despite taking a liking to the synopsis, but I was swayed to give it a go with the beautiful art style (IMO).\r\nThe first episode took a turn quicker than I expected. I was launched straight into the story and it was amazing. They relayed the story in a fast-paced but certainly not rushed span over 25 episodes very cleanly. Once the story started to heat up we were given the ties to the loose ends and openings to new developments without breaking the story or overdoing it. Not manyseries can do that smoothly. \\n\\n\r\nThe fact that \"good always prevail\" wasnt plastered over each battle, gave relief to me. Not that it wasnt given but things happen in this anime where a hero isnt always there to save the day. The inner workings of war and history really give more depth without being boring to the viewers!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters were evenly distributed in screen time but still left mystery to some development. New ones came and went and they still gave enough progression for the enemy to give characteristics to the show.\\n\\n\r\nArt as mentioned was what truly swayed me into watching this anime. It  has beautiful work, easy on the eyes and no movement left out.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtracks were fitting and committing to the situations. Both OP's and ED were great! \\n\\n\r\nI was drawn in to this anime through adventure and was captivated by the actiona and drama to be left with attachments, suspense and ample room for development.",

            "content": "Let me just start off with saying this. I just finished this series and I feel pretty happy. Not sad, not angry, or frustrated. Just happy. I think its important to note this because when it really comes down to it, anime, no any art form is supposed to inspire feelings. These feelings are what make our lives more enjoyable and become important pieces of ourselves. This anime made me smile. So if you take anything away from this review, first take away that it is worth watching and will make you feel the spirit of adventure and kindness. \r\nI would say the story isexcellent. It is thought provoking, has few plot holes and  leaves the viewer with a sense of mystery after each episode. This story really hits the ground running. After looking back from the first few episodes, a lot has happened. It isn't because I forgot but merely because there is so much going on that by the end, the events that happened at the beginning have tied together with the end. One another note, the story isn't complex (different than being eventful). There aren't many side stories going on and each iteration of the plot ends up meeting back to the main story. So in summation, the story is bulky but not confusing, which could be a nice break if any of you have just finished a confusing or saddening series. This anime heavily emphasizes the disputes of crusaders. The main enemy group, is a kingdom of religious warriors (this is not a spoiler). Much like in the Crusades by the Catholic Church in real life, these people are always trying to force their rules and views on their opposition. It really makes you think about what is truly right. On a side note, I have been raised Catholic so I really felt some neat feelings while watching this anime. Anyone with a religious belief, or even without one but with a belief in something, can understand the idea that \"your way is the only way.\" It is hard to think around it. But this anime really shows you how horrible it looks when you try to force your ideals on others. Overall, great story. Nice and simple, but filling and somewhat mysterious. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is great. So many characters make such an imprint in your mind that you wish this series had more episodes just to see more art. it isn't what makes this series work, but it definitely doesn't hold the rest of the anime back. Some of the LARGE scale fights look a bit dinky at times but that is only because I assume it is tiresome for the writer to make never ending soldier images. The single combat is done very well, which is a big plus. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound actually didn't really catch my attention but the fact that I was feeling emotions from the scenes that mattered is a good indicator that the sound made a difference. I wish I had more to note on the music but it was what is was; not that bad but didn't leave a mark like others have done. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters and their development was what really made this anime. Not only will you fall in love with the art of many of the people, you will grow to feel for many of them. Each has their own subtle role to fill but you aren't really told what they are. Sure, you have the main character acting as a kingly figure, but everyone else is kind of on their own. Each character also changes over the course of meeting the main character, Arslan. What I find especially astounding is how well even some of the enemies tie together (I won't spoil anything but it is done pretty well). From the very beginning, the main character is exposed to all sorts of evils and treachery. He kills people but hates it, he cares for people but learns to do his duty. As the characters progress, you will question if what they do is right, and will wonder what is going on for each of them. Truly an intriguing set of characters.   \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed this series with vigor and admiration. It is done well and although I grade it an 8, that is merely a baseline. It may suit people better than others but if you watch it you will surely leave it feeling happy and enabled to do good in the world.",

            "content": "So I'm back to anime and I decided to start by reviewing Arslan Senki. An anime that I was really hyped for basically because of the name ''Arakawa Hiromu''. For the few people that might don't know she is the creator of one of the most successful manga of all time called ''Fullmetal Alchemist''. But she doesn't stop there as sh is also the creator of the really interesting school life ''silver spoon'' which is a title that makes you want to drop everything and attend an agricultural school. So generally speaking Arakawa has a really respected name in animanga community and seeing her newtitle called ''Arslan Senki'' getting an anime adaptation I believe lots of us were more than excited to see the results which were... utterly disappointing. And here are the reasons.\\n\\n\r\n''Arslan Senki'' started of with a humble first episode and as it was going on everything showed that it was going to be the hidden gem of the spring season (that wasn't so hard though the spring season was horrible). And indeed the first three episodes were more than enough for building the hype. The fights were really good and the story was developing slowly but with a steady and interesting pace and it also set some good questions about religion and war. And few episodes before reaching the middle this series looked like a realistic anime that could be a masterpiece. But only until the middle. Because after that Arslan Senki became entirely ridiculous. Suddenly we  had supernatural entities and people who could jump from their horses to the backs of elephants (!). And ok I may exaggerating a little bit too much so let's just say that Arslan is not a realistic anime. That still doesn't excuse the stupid characters that fell to the childish war techniques that the supposed master tactician called Narsus was setting. Neither the fact that after a while we were seeing exactly the same thing!!! Arslan and his gang arrive to a place with peaceful purposes but the king of this country is evil and tries to set a trap to Arslan's army without of course any luck.\\n\\n\r\nArtistically also the anime had a lot of problems. The animation was horrible. Even initially you could say that it was mediocre but at least not so dreadful as it was in the latter episodes. The poor CGI graphics made thing even worse. The soundtracks were good there were some memorable and interesting works. The openings were performed by Uverworld and NICO touches the walls (personal favorite Japanese band) and while good if you have heard  other songs from those two bands you will admit that were not their bests. The voice acting didn't have any exceptional performances because the characters didn't have anything interest to make anyone stand out.\\n\\n\r\nWhich brings me finally to the characters. Arslan was plain boring as the protagonist. I really hoped for an extremely good development but in the end this development didn't come. Daryun was too perfect for me and Narsus was also boring as hell. In fact the only character that I actually liked was Gieve's character but near the end he disappears leaving us with all the uninteresting characters. The character design was also disappointing. It seemed like  Arakawa was trying not to copy FMA's artwork but she ended up copying FMA's artwork after all. Silver Mask while initially an interesting villain as the story progressed he became a cliche villain that you can find in another twenty anime or so.\\n\\n\r\nOk I know that I shouldn't blame so much Arakawa because she doesn't have any connection with the anime apart from the source material. So in order to be fair I maybe should read the manga because the anime had a really open ending without any resolution. Now if you should  watch the anime my answer is no. While it starts really promising the creators don't know what they want destroying this was a story that could be really good. You will not believe that the creator of the manga is also the creator of our all time favorite FMA\\n\\n",

            "content": "I didn't want to watch Arslan Senki but boredom bit my ass and here we are, pals.\r\nIt's all about some prince's journey who tries to get his city back because people betrayed him. Nothing new here. This is Akatsuki no Yona minus the romance (but no worries, the harem is still there) meets the Eastern setting of Magi meets Kingdom but without the captivating warfare narrative. I won't say it lacked action because it got plenty but it definitely lacked something that would have made the story enthralling. The mystery behind Arslan's identity was a good start. However, this subplot was not developed fully whichleft me with lots of unanswering questions.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters don't change and are often one dimensional -- there are little development and even less growth. They are pretty much all OP and often find easily their way out of desperate situations. For a story that is character-driven, they didn't evolve much.\\n\\n\r\nPlease, tell me which one is the brightest banana in the bunch because they all seem like (endearing) losers to me:\\n\r\n- There is the good guy with white hair (of course he has white hair). He's so innocent and righteous and wants to save everyone because this is the right thing to do, right? In real life, my precious son Arslan would have gotten killed faster than Ned Stark. Did I mention he has white hair? #specialsnowflake\\n\r\n- The invincible dude who only got two words in his mouth: 'Your Highness', and oh boy, that's one hell of a talent waste for Hosoya Yoshimasa. Even that ambiguous loyalty for Arslan was off-putting at times. Does he love him like a mother or a lover? Don't know, can't tell. But choose, mate, you can't do both.\\n\r\n- The one more OP than Aizen and Madara combined. He knows everything but tells no one, always gets what he wants and his plans never fail because he's so clever. Plus the bishie is voiced by Namikawa Daisuke. I'm telling you, perfect. Wait. He does have one flaw: he can't draw. Oh, my bad. Let's not forget there are two kids vying for his attention -- one seeing him as a father figure and the other as a lover but the dude is a blank sheet of paper who gives no shit.\\n\r\n- Then there's the priestess who's there because?? Who knows? Maybe they needed someone with boobs to please everyone. I'm still waiting for the reason she serves our precious Snowflake Prince but I guess it's in the trash with the other character developments I should have got.\\n\r\n- And finally, the other bishie who can do anything but sing? Funny thing since he's supposed to be a minstrel but the dude doesn't know how to rhyme. He may be the funniest character in that show but I feel like there is a heavy story behind his playfulness. Why does he hate royalty? Why does he travel and where does he go? Why a troubadour knows how to ride a horse, use a bow, spar with knights and seduce women but can't make fucking rhymes? So many questions, Grieve, come back and answer them.\\n\r\n- I forgot the spy who comes from a loosely-inspired India and acts as the only diversity in this cast of happy misfits and the religious fanatic named '\u00e9toile' which means 'star' in French. If their goal was to make me cringe, it is a success.\\n\\n\r\nDespite that, this bunch is lovable. Lovable idiots who are so naive I wanted to engrave my head on the wall.\\n\r\nBut still better than the antagonists. We got a hothead boy with daddy issues, who got facial burn and is voiced by Yuki Kaji but I swear it's not Shouto from My Hero Academia. And for some reasons, everyone follows him because of plot convenience. Also, there is this country invading the land of our heroes, sacking the capital, burning the books and all instruments of knowledge, waging wars that kill millions of people so they could convert those same people to the religion of a god with an unpronounceable name. Japanese are truly amazing. They know how to make one-dimensional characters like no one else.\\n\\n\r\nNonetheless, this anime teaches interesting human values. It tackles the infamous subjects of slavery and religion, despite how ridiculous their depiction of religion is. It stays roughly shallow but I'd like to thank them for the effort. \\n\\n\r\nIt's a shame though. The beginning promised a tale of blood and vengeance with a complexed protagonist on an epic journey to regain his home, internally torn as he's discovering more about the world and his own identity. Sadly, it failed to deliver.\\n\\n\r\nI'd love to criticize the art but there is not much to say. The OST was gorgeous to hear, it's perhaps the redeeming point of this anime. The seiyuu's acting was on point and the opening and ending were wonderful to listen and watch. Especially the first ending signed Eir Aoi who got me more hyped than the actual anime.\\n\r\nThe average viewer will not notice the 'subtle' mix of 2D and 3D which was hideous yet funny to see. The fights were well animated but the battles... Please don't let this studio ever animate a battle again. As I said, characters are freaking stones, so they don't do lots of facial expressions but on top of that, they move like legos and honestly, it was hilarious to watch. Now don't get me started on the horses' animation, I've said enough already.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it lacked some conflict to create an engaging tale. Characters were nice but did not reach their potential. I'm lowkey disappointed because I was waiting for more from the guys that brought us Fullmetal Alchemist and Legend of the Galactic Heroes but it still entertained me. I'm not sure if I'll remember it tomorrow though.\\n\\n\r\nPS: There is this fabulous scene where a black guy with abs jumps on an elephant while riding his horse. Thank me later.",

            "content": "I'll be honest, I was somewhat reluctant to watch this show.  I had just finished the amazing show known as Akatsuki no Yona (Yona of the Blushing Dawn) and was not particularly interested in watching another, probably not as amazing, show of similar genre and plot.  In the end, I'm glad I watched it though.  It's certainly not the most perfect of shows, but it definitely had it's high points.  So, ladies and gentlemen, here is my opinion of the show Arslan Senki, aka The Heroic Legend of Arslan.\r\nStory: 8\r\nThe plot of this show was surprisingly satisfying.  Yeah, it hadmany similarities to Akatsuki no Yona, but so did Zankyou no Terror (Terror in Resonance) to Death Note, and I still enjoyed that show despite the fact.  While at first it may seem like any other story that we've seen thousands of times before, what sets it apart is where they take that plot.  Other than the bare base of it, the show ended up being very different from AnY, which is why I was glad I didn't skip over it.  The use of strategy blended with epic action provided an excellent presentation of the art of war.  It was different enough to keep it interesting, but also familiar enough so that it almost felt nostalgic, like a storybook one would read as a child.  And while I was a little bored in the beginning, as the series progressed I could feel myself becoming more and more invested and interested, to the point where I just couldn\u2019t wait for the next episode to come out.\\n\r\nThe only reason I didn\u2019t give the story a 9 was because at times the battles seemed too perfect.  I mean, when you have an expert strategist so all of your plans go perfectly and a warrior who might as well have been a Greek god, what more could a prince want?  Throw in a couple other amazing fighters to the gang, and you\u2019ve got the most convenient team of all time.  Now sometimes this set up can work; just look at No Game, No Life.  But unfortunately, Arslan Senki doesn\u2019t pull this off as gracefully as No Game.  While I was certainly enjoying the show, tension just wasn\u2019t part of that enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5\\n\r\nI\u2019m going to give you one name to encompass my feeling of the character designs in this show: Arakawa Hiromu.  Don\u2019t recognize the name?  Perhaps you\u2019ll recognize her as the creator of Fullmetal Alchemist then?  Yes, the creator of Fullmetal Alchemist designed the characters for this show, so of course they\u2019re fabulous and gorgeous.  They\u2019re colorful and interesting to look at and simply wonderful.  Of course I\u2019d expect nothing less from Arakawa-sensei.  The only negative thing I can think of is that Arslan looks kinda girly, but hey, little details.\\n\r\nSo you may be asking yourself why I gave Art a 5 when here I am singing the praises of the design.  Well, I\u2019ll tell you.  The animation.  It.  Was.  BAAAAAD.  Okay, BAAAAAD may be an exaggeration, but it was definitely not good.  The movements were stiff and jumpy and unnatural, and watching those horses move physically hurt me.  Now, I won\u2019t fault them too much for horses because they are one of the trickiest animals in existence to animate, and finding a well animated horse in an anime is a rather rare sight.  What I will fault them for is the CG.  The horrible, horrible CG.  In my eyes, CG should mostly be used on non-living things: cars, magic and effects, and other inanimate objects.  Sadly, that\u2019s not what animation studios use it for.  They use it for things like monsters and large crowds of people, living things in other words.  And looking at what they\u2019ve given me, I\u2019ve decided for myself that living things simply move too complexly and noticeably for CG to animate and still make it look natural within the rest of the series.  Arslan Senki essentially did everything I DON\u2019T want studios to do when they use CG.  Not only did they use it on large crowds of complexly moving, fighting warriors, they had the gall to give us up-close shots of horrendous CG warrior faces as they awkwardly jerked around.  Not even the beauty of Arakawa Hiromu\u2019s creations could fix the terror that was the animation.  Everything about it just screamed \u201clow-budget\u201d which is a real shame indeed.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nI\u2019m a little conflicted over the opening and ending tracks.  The songs themselves were great; I mean, you can never go wrong with NICO Touches the Walls (Hologram - OP 2 of FMA: Brotherhood) or Kalafina (Magia - ED of Madoka Magica), but I wonder just how well these songs really fit with the show.  I mean, I guess they work, but sometimes I couldn\u2019t help but feel like the creators just said to themselves, \u201cHey!  These bands are popular!  If we use their music, we\u2019re sure to get views!\u201d  The only song I really felt went well with the series was the first ending, Lapis Lazuli by Aoi Eir, and then halfway through the series it was\u2026 well\u2026 replaced.  As for the OST, it was pretty standard, though I will admit that it fit the show much more naturally than the OP and ED.  It\u2019s got your classic \u201cwe\u2019re off to war!\u201d epic battle music with lots of horns and brass, but nothing that really stands out from the ordinary.  Then again, do you really want the OST to stand out all that much?  It did its job, and it did it fairly well, so I\u2019m not going to fault it for that.\\n\r\nAs far as voice acting goes, Arslan Senki is pretty average in that regard as well.  The voices fit the characters well, but they seem kind of\u2026 how to put it\u2026 flat.  There just wasn\u2019t a whole lot of variety to how the actors said their lines.  One character would always sound like he\u2019s shouting while another always sounds sassy while another always sounds apathetic while another always sounds growly.  This made the characters themselves seem kinda two-dimensional, which is hardly a good thing.  Then again, this isn\u2019t exactly uncommon in the majority of anime out there.  Does that make it forgivable?  Maybe for some, but for me?  Not really.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7\\n\r\nAs I said about 5 sentences ago, the voice acting puts a damper on the characters themselves.  They seem kind of flat whenever they talk, like their manner of speech is their most defining feature.  However, this is partially made up for by the writing.  Throughout the course of the show, some of the major characters get their share of development, and you begin to care for them after a certain point.  There\u2019re two major problems here, though.  One: only some of the characters get developed.  The others are just kind of\u2026 there.  There\u2019s nothing wrong with them as a character, but we just haven\u2019t been given a reason to really care about them yet.  We get a bit of that in the sequel, Fuujin Ranbu, but this isn\u2019t a review of the sequel, now is it?  The second problem is the delay.  You don\u2019t really begin to become interested in the characters until a few episodes in, which makes the beginning a little slow.  I think you\u2019re supposed to like Arslan from the beginning, but even with him it takes a while to see what he\u2019s really made of.  As far as characters go as a whole, they\u2019re enjoyable enough, but it\u2019s a slow burn before you get to the real meat.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nI\u2019m the kind of watcher that can forgive a lot of sins so long as the plot and characters are good, because that is where my main enjoyment comes from.  Arslan Senki was a show I was really quite interested in, but even with my forgiving nature there was too much blatantly wrong with it to fully immerse myself in the experience.  That\u2019s not to say I didn\u2019t enjoy it; however, if it wasn\u2019t for the underwhelming character portrayals and horrific CG, I might have enjoyed this show much, much more.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\r\nYou can tell that this show has a very solid foundation (if you didn\u2019t know, the show is based off a very successful novel series) and a whole lot of potential.  What\u2019s a shame is that it just didn\u2019t have the resources necessary to fully realize this potential.  What we did get, however, wasn\u2019t terrible; I\u2019m sure the common anime watcher will have little problem deriving enjoyment from this show.  Is it a masterpiece?  Unfortunately, no.  Is it still good?  You bet.\\n\\n\r\n(A note on my ranking scale: My average anime score is 7.  This is because I rate on quality and enjoyment, not in comparison to other works.  A 5 would be something I was completely indifferent to, and since I somewhat enjoy most shows I watch, my average is 7)",

            "content": "Arslan Senki captivated me from the moment I began watching. From its music to its diverse and loveable cast of characters, this anime has so much to offer to its viewer that it merits two play-throughs to get the full benefit. There\u2019s already a pretty good synopsis written above so I\u2019ll spare you that and jump right into the review.\r\nArt: 8\r\nWhile the vast majority of the art is fantastic the CGI is rather noticeable and jarring at times. Though, I do completely understand the reasons for utilizing this technique. They needed to animate massive armies numbering in the tens of thousands. To do so byhand or traditional methods would be tedious and a waste of time/resources. Everything else was spectacular \u2013 from the set pieces to the characters themselves. You can easily ascertain the tone of a particular scene by the art alone. When telling a story art, sound, and characters all have to work together to illustrate the plot, and this anime succeeded in that regard.\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nLet me just say that the soundtrack is PHENOMINAL. It\u2019s so damn good that I play it on repeat while I\u2019m gaming. It\u2019s different from most soundtracks that you\u2019ll hear in other anime, and fits the tone and setting extremely well. As far as audio/sound effects are concerned \u2013 they are expertly done. Something as simple as the swing of a sword sounds full and believable. When a powerful character enters the scene your ears are greeted by heroic (or menacing) fanfare and a specialized soundboard. When the iconic characters, such as Daryun, swing their weapons about its something akin to a hurricane. When they make contact you can almost feel the impact. Everything about these characters sounds powerful and epic.\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\r\nIt\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve fallen in love with a cast of characters. Arslan Senki presents us with what I like to call a \u201cHero Themepark.\u201d Basically this is a show that centers around a set of heroes who are, aside from a few bumps and bruises, seemingly invincible. Though this concept applies to the villains as well. So what happens when these epic, near-invincible characters collide? Some of the highest octane, nail-biting action you\u2019ve ever seen in an anime. When a character is defeated or dies it feels like a god has been slain, and it changes your perception of the victor entirely. \u201cHe/she is far more powerful than I thought.\u201d You\u2019ll see these heroes take out entire waves of enemies all by themselves. Daryun\u2019s name alone strikes fear into the hearts of enemies.\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nThe series is a MUST WATCH, and is severely undervalued. You can find it on Hulu or Gogoanime. The story, characters, and music are all on point and work together to bring one of the best series of 2015. If only season 2 wasn\u2019t 8 episodes long\u2026wtf man. \\n",

It was only later on that i found out that it is by the same guy who created the amazing Legend of Galactic Heroes.\r\nArslan is your generic war story and it is selfaware of that. Instead of throwing in overly artistic/philosiphical/psychological elements it stays true to its genre. That may be cliche for some, but if you like that kind of story (and enjoy JRPGs like Suikoden^^) Arlsan will be an amazing and emotional ride for you with an amazing presentation.

            "content": "I like anime with action and mystery, but it is my first time seeing an anime about war and knights, so I didn't expect too much for Arslan Senki. But it was absolutely great ! \r\nStory : 9 / 10\r\nThe story is really interesting. It shows the war in its very aspects, such as barbarity, the motivation of both sides : Pars and Lusitania. Neither of them are clean, since Pars use slavery and Lusitanians kill those who don't believe in their god. The young prince Arslan will have to restore its kingdom, but it won't be easy. The different battles are epic, sometimes violent,but they were well-done according to me. Moreover, the anime is not just about war,  we have some magic into it (although it wasn't well-developped), mystery, and also funny moments. Plus, the relationship between the characters is pleasant. We know why they are here. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters : 9/10\\n\r\nThis anime has great characters ! At first, I thought that Arslan would be annoying, since he was always protected by Daryun, but he's a good character. He's kind and he gradually becomes mature. He realizes the atrocity of the war, but he also tries to understand the motivations of his ennemies. Moreover, he isn't weak. Then, we have Daryun, one of the most powerful warrior in Arslan's side who can be overprotective, Narsus the excellent strategist (all of his ideas were impressive), Elam the cute and loyal servant, Gieve the funny and highly skilled poet, and Farangis the beautiful archer (at first I was afraid that she would be only there for the fan service but fortunately it was not the case). I enjoyed their personality, their strength, their skills, and they made me laugh a lot. At the opposite, we have Silver Mask as the main antagonist, who is eager to become the king of Pars. He's strong and scary, and one of the best ennemies I've ever seen in an anime. And as the story progresses, different protagonists make their appearances, in both sides. Alfreed was annoying at first but she was also funny and useful during battles, just as Kishward, Jaswant... And the conflict between Rajendra and Gadevi during the Sindhura arc was really interesting, without forgetting Etoile who comes back during the second half of the show, and also in the end.\\n\\n\r\nArt : 9/10\\n\r\nI really like the chara-design, it is similar to those of the manga, illustrated by Hiromu Arakawa, and the moves of the characters during the battles were really fluid (I agree that sometimes there were some problems, but they were minors, and I was so enthralled by the show that it didn't matter for me.\\n\r\nThe backgrounds were absolutely amazing. Colors were beautiful, and they also took care to do oriental style backgrounds, especially when the protagonists are in Sindhura.\\n\\n\r\nSound : 9/10\\n\r\nThe ost perfectly stick with the different events, especially during the battles, and emotional moments such as in the last episode (spoilers : when Etoile is coming to say a prayer for the fallen soldiers of Lusitania). I also enjoyed the openings and endings. Both of the openings are dynamic, and I really like the ending \"One Light\" by Kalafina.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I really enjoyed this anime. It became one of my favorites. I didn't expect that. The two last episodes were amazing, epic and beautiful. But it has an open end, some mysteries still remain, so I hope for a second season.",

            "content": "So to start of this is one of those anime there you should watch atleast 3-4 episodes before judging and here is why. \r\nThe story is one of those fantasy tales we have heard of in old books about the boy in the high castle learning that life isnt so easy or nice as he has thought all his life protected in the bossom of his parents. That kinda made me become a little wary since those types of stories have either one of those things. It has the most cheesiest plot ever invented to how the main character becomes turn around and becomes therightfull ruler in his fathers eyes or just keeps behaving like a spoiled child to the end of the anime until he finally realises hes wrong. This anime fortunately didnt either one. Characters i will go back to but story wise thats just a summary that its not that bad. The story was better than i would expect with great battles and good tactics shown in the entire series. It kinda reminds me of how Game of thrones could be without needed to put  sex , dragons or boobs in. It has its own style that defines it and it takes it time not pushing anything to far and it doesnt rush past what should have been. Eventhough i say all is well with it there are cheesy parts i felt like they could have made alot more brutal and could have needed some evil ish scenes. \\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound both feels nice and fits with the movie the opening is a much watch even if you dont watch the anime since its that addictive. \\n\\n\r\nAlas we come to characters. Yes it has it share of interesting characters and i dare tell you if anyone comes to me telling how  overpowered someone is here that thats the clear definition of not having watched it. Specially the main character hes probably one of the weakest battle and skill wise i have ever seen. He follows mostly what people tells him to and he lacks any form of planning and yes this is the to be King. Not being overpowered or too strong is one thing but the only good thing this guy have going for him is his faith in everyone who walks up to him. Naivity has a name and thy name is Arslan. The rest of the characters have a more interesting variation but i give the characers 6 because some of them just doesnt feel in any way much original. \\n\\n\r\nI learned to enjoy it after watching 4 episodes since before that i wanted to throw the main character down a pit and tip boulders down the pit. The battles and scenes are well made, many of the characters can be called good fitting the story but its just good for me nothing more. It doesnt have that factor alot of other anime has. It has its own feel but not so high that it deserves any higher then 7. \\n",

            "content": "Arslan has a great premise with a medieval setting thats hard not to like but its like a bowl of boring pasta without the chilli sauce. . . ye get me. . .\r\nThe Heroic legend of Arslan or Arslan senki was first a fantasy novel series by Yoshiki Tanaka and was later adapted to manga a second time with illustrations by Hiromu Arakawa. So thats what got adapted to anime in 2015.\r\nIts a story about a naive kid prince who is fated to be a ruler. His comrades appreciate what his ideals are but also know that things wont be so easy,  loyalties growstronger as the prince slowly walks down a righteous path to true royalty and becomes a true king of the people. . .  Well i think thats whats up...\\n\\n\r\nAfter looking at the 2015 spring anime chart i thought daymn arslan has some competition, will it be one of the good ones?\\n\r\n            What i like. I like the kids development. . . He starts off annoying me but as the end of the series drew near i thought he was becoming someone i could watch another season of. The supporting characters are needed with these kind of mains and they do pretty good. Narsus's strategy, Daryun's strength all to important when i guess, raising this kid into a ruler.\\n\r\n             I thinks this is the lightest this show will be. . . what i mean is that a darker under story is all to evident in the first season and it staying as light hearted as the first season, is unlikely and thank god for that, we need a  darker undertone so that the gravity of his ordeals aren't forgotten the next day. \\n\r\n          I like the villain. . . he has his own ordeals and some of mystery. I see him becoming good at the end, realising his path was broken from the start.\\n\\n\r\nI didnt like arslan at the beginning but was happy i stuck with him because he does grow on you. His character is kind of bland in the beginning and slowly he gets more interesting as he grows up with these awesome support characters.\\n\r\n         My biggest problem was the lack of oomphf of this series i get that its political at times and they do that in a way where im not sleeping through dialogue, so nice one i guess but comparing this to other 2015 spring anime the edge was not there.\\n\\n\r\nDo i recommend Arslan Senki? Ye i do, its a mellow ride that i enjoyed. Might be because im a fan of war stories, strategy and a ruler thats for the people or it could of been because i was playing total war and wanted a story similar to what i was doing, either way i rated this quality viewing. .  . \\n",

The plot itself is pretty direct and there are not much twist, which can be a good thing as it keeps the viewer on track and the easiness to grab the message the creator is trying to convey. \r\nThe winning point for this anime is definitely its characters. Character development is pretty decent , and most of them are like-able even withantagonists. Daryunn and Narsus are amazingly done and written. One represents the mind and the other the sword of the MC, Arslan, guiding him through the hardships if warfare and to succeed as a ruler of a kingdom\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this is a enjoyable anime if one is interested in military affairs, as it greatly stresses on war strategies and the values of being a great ruler.",

Hiromu Arakawa is a mangaka who can turn a simple tale of adventure into an enthralling legend. Each endearing comic aside, and every detail of plot and action, adapted out dispels that magic. I couldn't understand the reviewers who ranked FMA:Brotherhood far below the manga, when the body of it was adapted almost exactly. I understand them now. \r\nThe final act of this anime runs to a predictable close, by a predictable route. Good monthly manga can get away with this; the timescale of release evokes ourheroes' long, hard struggle. Weekly anime can't escape damage from a predictable close, not even good ones.\\n\\n\r\nAnd this anime is good; the dialogue is full of spark and novelty, characters are all very memorable, and the central struggle is at least epic in scale. The protagonists have some excellent dramatic moments, but most of the villains are really far too unambiguous for a 'historical' manga. The series really is too morally simplistic at heart, and, again, the director seemed lacking in the focus of Akakawa's manga panels. Practically every change from the source manga that I can see weakens the story, which has to rush through the manga's material, and was never going to conclude the whole novel series in any case.\\n\\n\r\n I'd recommend this series mildly, but the final act is quite a slog.",

            "content": "Arslan Senki or otherwise known in English as The Heroic Legend of Arslan, is a story about the crown prince of Pars, Arslan, as he embarks on a journey to retake the fallen kingdom of Pars from the Lusitanians with the help of his loyal sevants. \r\nIt's an adaption of Hiromu Arakawa's manga adaption of Yoshiki Tanaka's novel by the same name and who is also celebrated for the war-epic Legend of the Galactic Heroes.\r\nStory:\r\nAs I've stated above, it's a story of a crown prince who embarks on a journey to retake the fallen kingdom of Pars. This kind of story, a prince who retakesa kingdom, has been very much told from time to time. If I were to compare it, it's like Fire Emblem. But one should not look at it as a whole since the most important is the journey itself on HOW he retakes the fallen kingdom.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a coming-of-age story, drama,war and tactics. With the use of its colors, one also expects that it is also grounded in reality. But take heed my friend, I was blown away when \"magic\" appeared out of nowhere. This is the kind of anime where magic should not even be needed to further the story.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nTo be honest, for me, the art was a beauty when it's focused on a character's face or a particular character. ( one to two characters ) The art falls deeply when it is not focused on a character or when there are too many characters to draw.\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion, budget has something to do with this. Sometimes the art was great, then becomes average, then it becomes lacking. If it had a greater budget, especially since it's historical one should expect luxurious clothes, palaces, castles and locations, my eyes would've cried in sheer joy.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nThe animation is good when there are one to one fights ( amazing when daryun vs hermes ) but falls flat sometimes in horses and in massive scales of armies because the CGI was so below-average.\\n\\n\r\nLighting:\\n\r\nI need to separate this, because in Arslan Senki, when it's daytime there is light. But when there are some scenes that happen in hidden places, like sewers, one must expect that in undergrounds it is dark so the staffs should do something about the lighting, but in Arslan Senki, when it is dark, it is literally dark. Dark in a sense that, soldiers fighting in the sewers can barely be seen anymore. I am not joking.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nPretty good in my honest opinion.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe characters are enjoyable but they lack back-story and developments ( Arslan is excluded ). In this war-drama I expected those characters that didn't have experiences in war before be shocked but it's never dived upon ( Arslan included ).\\n\\n\r\n( I don't know how I would take this matter in my hands, because in those times, warring kingdoms and all, it must have been \"normal\" for them to see people die. But to see people die getting sliced and stabbed to death, do they also take that as \"normal\"? )\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI'm a sucker for historical,war, strategies and throne-rivalries, so I enjoyed the heck out of Arslan Senki. It's the only anime I watched in the spring season.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like playing Fire Emblem, then you would surely like this.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nIn all its glory, Arslan Senki is enjoyable. Enough to satisfy you. But it is without flaws. \\n\\n\r\nFlaws:\\n\\n\r\n-Magic\\n\r\n-Character Developments\\n\r\n-Animation\\n\r\n-CGI\\n\r\n-Lighting\\n\r\n-Budget\\n\r\n-Unbelievable scenes ( Horse on top of a raging elephant, surrounded with archers and not even getting a scratch )\\n\\n\r\nAs of now, I'm waiting for the announcement of a 2nd season because it sure felt like there is one.",

            "content": "Heroic Legend of Arslan is a fantasy-adventure anime focused on the efforts of young prince of Pars, Arslan, and several of his supporters trying to reclaim their kingdom after it is taken over by the strongly religious neighboring nation of Lusitania. While gathering allies to help support his cause, Arslan and his allies come to learn more of the prince's origins and that someone among Lusitania's ranks is seeking to claim rights over the throne to Pars.\r\nWhile Arslan proclaims itself to be a fantasy-adventure title, there are actually little elements of fantasy to be found within the series beyond a few minor enemy threats. Instead,the series is mostly focused on exploring the hostilities between Pars and Lusitania with the repercussions of slavery, religious fanaticism and ruling under an absolute monarchy being explored throughout the series as Arslan tries making sense of the problems occurring within both kingdoms while traveling with his allies. These repercussions are what drive the conflict of the series as Pars' absolute rule and enslavement of those they conquered later lead to Lusitania usurping their rule, while turning out no differently from the corruption brought about through Pars' rule thanks to their religious fanaticism and those in power exploiting it for their personal gain. These elements are nicely explored as they help to shape Arslan's beliefs on how he would like to change things with the hostilities between Pars and Lusitania, and create genuine conflict out of Arslan and his allies trying to reclaim rule over Pars.\\n\\n\r\nIn regards to the developments of Arslan and his comrades, our titular hero gets prominent focus and development for the majority of the series as he becomes exposed to the hardships and corruption found with influential political and military leaders he encounters throughout his quest, as these experiences help to shape his beliefs on what sort of rule he would want to enforce while under the guidance of his allies. A few of the major enemy threats in the series also get fleshed out in regards to their background and motives, like the mysterious Silver Mask, the Lusitanian soldier Etoile and members of the Shindra kingdom encountered later in the series. However character development is mostly nonexistent with the members of Arslan's group as they only get enough fleshing out to provide basic details on their backgrounds and the personality types they will regularly exhibit throughout the series, existing solely as advisers or protectors to Arslan without having any defined characteristics that make them stick out as characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe lack of characterization with Arslan's allies were not the only issue I took up with this series. The middle of its run does drag a bit during the episodes where Arslan and his group are within Shindra where they face resistance from Pars or Shindra forces, with the group able to conveniently overcome each threat. The way in which the conflicts get overcome at this point reek of laziness as it seemed like the show's writers were trying to pass off each conflict as something that the group's tactician, Narsus, anticipated and planned out yet many instances of this are not explored or hinted to throughout the middle of Arslan's run. In addition, the series lacks a proper conclusion as Silver Mask and those among Lusitania's ranks are still at large to oppose Arslan and his allies at a later time beyond the TV anime's run.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I suppose my thoughts of Arslan are a bit mixed. While I did enjoy seeing the gradual developments of Arslan's character and the exploration of hostilities between Pars and Lusitania, the lack of fleshing out on Arslan's allies, the dragged out middle part of the show and the lack of a proper finale do hurt the show's quality to a good degree. Still, it is a decent fantasy-adventure title that you don't find much of out of anime nowadays and is still worth a look if you crave titles of the genre.",

            "content": "I think ancient warfare ranks alongside football right at the top of the list of things that bore me to death, so I didn't begin this series with the highest of expectations. Having the source material being shonen doesn't help either. Although the show does depict atrocities you might imagine from this setting, the presentation is bland and sanitised. Furthermore, with army commanders depicted not simply as leaders but practically gods with superhuman strength and fighting ability, this isn't merely a fantasy with strong military themes, but a teen fantasy with all the potentially fun parts of the subject matter (see Game of Thrones) cutout. \\n\\n\r\nNonetheless, for all the blandness of its setting and shonen implausibility, Arslan Senki tells a compelling story through a medium where having a coherent plot increasingly looks like an outdated fad. It's a story about conflict and the ideological factors that beget it. The main character, Arslan, struggles with the illegitimacy of his claim to the throne and the hypocrisy of his ideals, but his compassion and self-reflection inspire loyalty and bring together a cast of loyal followers who become strong characters in their own right. Hard decisions have to be made along the way, and the allies he has to make aren't always ideal. \\n\\n\r\nThere's definitely a sense of real-world connection and complexity to the political themes which gives the series a unique character, certainly no accident as the story is from the same man who wrote Legend of the Galactic Heroes. It's still maybe a tad too lighthearted, but that also makes the characters and their chivalrous banter all the more likeable. \\n\\n\r\nTo top it off, Arslan Senki is simply a good overall production. While I'm no fan of the mostly generic musical score, the animation is good (although there are a tad too many stiffly animated 3D soldiers) and unlike some other two-cour series, it maintains that standard throughout without any blatant or noticeable errors. \\n\\n\r\nArslan Senki ends only a fraction of the way through the story, but a second season is allegedly already in the pipeline. While I started off being prejudiced - to an extent I still am - towards its genre and artstyle, Arslan Senki hooked me with its epic story and scope. I look forward to its continuation.",

            "content": "This is a unique series with many familiar elements. It\u2019s set in a fantasy world that\u2019s almost, but not quite, identical to ancient Persia. Arslan is the crown prince, and soon enough the rightful claimant to the throne of Pars. Despite being a fantasy setting the fantastical elements are kept to a minimum and the story is mainly about young Arslan learning how to rule. The series generally feels like a historical epic, with massive battle scenes and constant textural identification of characters and their ranks to keep up clear on what\u2019s going on.\r\nThe plot is that of high politics. Arslan has to figure outwhat actions to take to achieve his goals and also what battles to fight and when to fight them. It\u2019s generally well done, although it can dawdle a bit on some fairly mundane issues. Fast pacing is not generally a virtue of this series. It spends the last twenty episodes or so not really getting Arslan any closer to his \u201ccapital\u201d of Ecbatana. The series could have done with trimming off a few episodes. Battle scenes were awe-inspiring and well done. The scale of these battles and the tactics involved were sensible and well conceived. This is one of the few anime out there that can do epic well. While the personal side of combat is never forgotten, the large scale battles between nameless hordes is shown on a scale that few Japanese productions can achieve.\\n\\n\r\nWhile there are clear heroes and villains, the goals and responsibilities are not so black and white, starting with the question of whether Arslan has the strongest claim to the throne or not. The evil Lusitanians have some good ideals, notably of freedom and equality, but are let down by a religious fanaticism that justifies anything. This is laid out early on by a Lusitanian soldier who comically goes on with noble sentiments about the equality of all mankind only to then express the view that heretics and nonbelievers are inherently inferior and must be purged. Alas, the religious beliefs are kept at that level of crazy and we get little nuance in the harsher end of that spectrum, to the point where Arslan can lecture people on religious tolerance in a particularly patronizing and simplistic way. The flip side of all this is that Pars is a slave-owning society who treats war captives barbarically. I thought they handled this idea far better, with Arslan\u2019s confusion over why anyone could possibly object to slavery for the defeated feeling very genuine and his arguments that they should just submit and they\u2019d be happy feeling suitably detached from any personal experience. In short, there\u2019s good and bad things to be said about both sides.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are probably the least interesting part of the series. Arslan himself is a caring, sweet guy. A bit too much of both to be frank. His most distinguishing character trait is his niceness. Daryun and Narsus (a transliteration error for Narses?) are his chief subordinates. Daryun is pure honorable unstoppable warrior, and his invulnerability reduces the tension of many of the more dangerous seeming battle scenes. Narsus is a bit more interesting. He\u2019s essentially the chief strategist, a very Japanese position and probably the least Persian-influenced character here. He\u2019s always right, which reduces the tension of battle scenes considerably. On the bright side, his obsession with his (abhorrent) artwork at least gives him a comic and human side.\\n\\n\r\nThere are other characters as well, though none of them have as important a role. Gieve is the typical cunning rogue, always trying to seduce or steal from somebody. Falangies is a priestess of Mithras and a great fighter. She probably has other character traits as well, though not many. Elam is Narsus\u2019 page and fits into the slightly worshipful servant role. Etoile is about the only interesting side character for me. Etoile is a Lusitanian soldier with an honorable streak who likes Arslan (despite not knowing he\u2019s Arslan) and has generally good ideals that come into conflict with the way the world works. Alas, there\u2019s not much of a role for a character like that. Silver Mask is the antagonist. That\u2019s really all that can be said about him. As might be gathered from the name he wears a mask to hide his identity, but when he takes it off we realize that (gasp) it\u2019s someone we\u2019ve never seen before. But I guess some of the other characters have. Seriously though, does nobody get suspicious of a guy wearing a mask? I feel like if he was on my side I\u2019d find out who he was under that. People who hide their identities generally have a good reason.\\n\\n\r\nAs a fan of Persian history I found myself very interested in this series. It\u2019s hard for me to judge how others will see it. Despite what people say it\u2019s not really about the life of Cyrus the Great. While Arslan has some family similarities to Cyrus, the story as a whole draws from all over Persian history, particularly the Byzantine/Persian wars which are a strong influence for the presentation of the Lusitanians. Another influence for them is obviously the Crusades, with the religious crusade and immensely French names (Guy of Lusignan was the last king of Jerusalem). Sassanid (3rd-7th century AD) influences are more common than Achaemenid (6th-4th century BC) ones for the people of Pars (itself the ancient name for Fars, Iran). While we do get the capital of Ecbatana, we also get marzbans, Middle Persian names like Shapur, and powerful eastern nomad conglomerations. On the whole it works better than it should.",

            "content": "\"And thus, the boy would become king.\" - Pretty much every episode's tagline\r\nArslan Senki is one of those anime that really needs to get a second season. Not because it's that great, but because it's source material basically forces it to. Apparently, the novel series (not light novels, mind you) is still running with 14 parts published. No matter how many seasons the anime gets, it won't be enough to completely adapt the books.\r\nBut does it work as an anime? In short: Yes, it's pretty good. It's flaws prevent it from being anything great but if you like this kind of story it'll be agood watch and you'll be left wondering where things go at the end.\\n\\n\r\nStory: [8/10]\\n\r\nIt should be pretty clear to everyone watching after just a few episodes just how much this is part of a larger work. A lot of time is spent on worldbuilding and directly and indirectly setting up characters and plotlines for later, or at least that's what i imagine certain small scenes and lines to be. Now, the plot is actually incredibly straightforward. If you've read the intro before watching the first episode you can more or less see most of what's coming the next few episodes for the rest of the season. But that's not neccessarily bad. It feels like a lot of the plot will go deeper as it continues, and almost none of the developments feel cheap or unrealistic. And that's where Arslan senki almost shines: it gives us a glimpse of how this world operates without being too nice about issues like war and slavery without getting stuck in the potential angst. Aside from that i enjoyed the pacing, everything keeps moving steadily without ever rushing or dwelling on an issue. A rarity as far as anime goes, and it helps to keep one interested in the developments.\\n\\n\r\nI have to be somewhat harsher on the characters. All of them work, they're all well-written, and they serve clear purposes to the story. Yet I can't shake the idea that some of them received too little time to properly show their colours early on. A priestess shows up a few episodes in and she's clearly important among the supporting cast (as her character design shows), but there is far too little time spent on her personality and motivation. Her subsequent appearances are devoid of much meaning, the same way her cool scene in the semi-final episode is robbed of it's charm. Perhaps I should just say that she's the only character whose name I flat-out forgot and I don't even care. The main cast does get enough attention, especially Arslan, though it's clear he has a lot of room for growth left for another 13 novels or so. Oh well, he's 15, i can cut him a break.\\n\\n\r\nSpecial note for the villains: they're all pretty great. The character designs help, but each of them has a clear personality, motivations, goals and means. The exception would be Kharlan's son, who seems to be thrown in there just to have Daryun fight someone strong, and apparently that has to be a named character.\\n\\n\r\nArt: [7/10]\\n\r\nThe characters designs will look familiar to anyone who has seen anything made by Hiromu Arakawa before (basically everyone who has seen FMA, so yeah, everyone), and that's a good thing as far as i'm concerned. The designs are great, the animation in the fight scenes is convincing while balancing on the edge of realism (anime-level) and exciting, and i really like the way Pars looks, it genuinely seems like a country with it's own culture and customs, and good art is vital for that. None of it is genius, but none of it is in any way bad.\\n\r\nExcept for the CGI. In these kinds of stories, the big battles are supposed to be a bit of a treat for those who care about them (like me), in which we get to see a lot of budget get wasted on a lot of gorgeous drawings and animations of armies gloriously stabbing the hell out of each other. The CGI takes the edge off of that, which pretty much sucks bigtime. It's not horrible, the opening battle at Atropene still looks appropriately horrifying, but later on the feel of the armies is really kind of hollow.\\n\\n\r\nFurther remarks:\\n\r\nI can barely remember any of the music, which is both a good and a bad thing. I suppose i'll listen to it when the ost comes out, but for now i'm kind of disappointed that the epic story of Arslan becoming king and reconquering his country didn't have a few cool songs that i remember right after watching the (season) finale. The second OP was really great, but even that was mostly just the first 20 seconds. Still, it got me hyped for the episode every time i heard it.\\n\r\nI can't compare this anime to the OVA because I haven't seen the latter. Doubt I ever will, but with 20+ years between them I don't feel like it's a bad idea to remake a story, especially with the new art.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict: [8/10]\\n\r\nHonestly, this show has a lot of things going against it. It has to cram a lot of characters into a short amount of time, deliver huge amounts of exposition, and end on a somewhat unsatisfying note in the hope of a sequel. Or ten. Still, the one thing I feel after finishing it: I want more. I want to know how the battles go from here. I want to know how Arslan deals with the hard issues, I want to see him grow more. I want to know how Silver Mask and the Lusitanians go from here, I want to see how the characters on the side develop, and how Arslan reacts to his parents. The anime's biggest flaw is how it's based on a huge series of novels. But maybe that's also one of it's greatest strengths.",

            "content": "DAAARRRYYYUUUNNNN!!! - The Heroic Legend of Arslan review\r\nThe Heroic Legend of Arslan is about the kingdom of Pars that has fallen to the hands of the Lusitania kingdom. Now Arslans, the young prince, must take arms and gather the remaining Parsian soldiers throughout the country in order to take back the capital of Ecbatana and become the crown King of Pars. While this isn\u2019t a Three Kingdoms or Warring states type show with intense war battles, it tells quite an engaging story with a \u2018magical\u2019 twist to it.\r\nArslan is the pampered prince of Pars whom is different from the rest of royalty because he seeseveryone as equals. In his maiden battle, he is weak and fragile however of much potential. As Pars falls, Arslan along with Daryun move on to find companions. The friends that they gather become attracted to Arslan because of his progressive mindset in difference to an enslaving and iron fist king unlike his father, the former king. Daryun is like the Zhao Yun of the Three Kingdoms in Arslan; the legendary warrior renown and feared as the Black Knight. He has epic scenes like the one where he got a huge adrenaline boost in spite of Arslan\u2019s endangerment in one of their battles. I\u2019m saying it is heart thumping once you see it. He serves as a loyal warrior and protector to Arslan and pretty damn hot. I\u2019m not gay but I would totally **** Daryun\u2019s ****. Ah, then we have the pragmatic Narsus who reaches out his tactical skills to Arslan after collecting Arslan\u2019s ambitions and resolve in align to his. He is well rounded in battle as well, offering more fire power to the prince\u2019s army. \\n\\n\r\nFor the other main characters in Arslan\u2019s group: Gieve, Falangies and Elam, they serve important plot points and aspects however not so vital like Daryun and Narsus. Gieve is a mysterious musician whom is surprisingly skilled in all aspects of combat, and does have his epic entrance when he spares one of the captured Marzban ending his suffering with an arrow to the head. Falangies was more of a convenient skilled members to join the group who already had sworn loyalty prior to joining Arslan, but we\u2019ll have to see until we learn more about her character in the next season, if there is. Elam is helpful at times and uncovering little by little of the sub plot with Etoile but that\u2019s really all he has offered as a character thus this entire season. \\n\\n\r\nNow onto the main villain, Silver Mask, he\u2019s quite a charming guy once you get to know him. He has a legitimate beef against Arslan and Andragoras III, the former king. Once he reveals who he is, it ushers quite a rush of both sympathy and excitement because of his contained backstory, however still mysterious as to what actually happened. While he has temporarily allied himself with Lusitania, he also has mysterious accomplices who support his goals, who use mystical powers in a world that probably doesn\u2019t know or has forgotten of its existence. And because of that twist, I can\u2019t wait to see what they will offer in the next season.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation is consistently well done. Though I do feel the CGI is quite awkward for the most part. It distorts the consistency in atmosphere when compared to the traditional drawn art. And for the most part, feels out of place. The animation is at its best when the fight scenes are shown. Daryun getting his adrenaline boost like I mentioned before had spectacular animation and it was just beast. As well as his fight against Silver Mask in the final battle. The clash of the sound of the swords feel so satisfying. It gets you drooling for more action. The movement of the characters in moments like this are a welcome joy and a pleasant viewing. It is the one of the most engaging aspects of the Arslan. The voice acting is well done. It captures the essence of war and battle, though from what we\u2019ve seen in a minimal score. Though never dividing your attention to the details.The first opening fits with the series. It makes itself unique and at home with the show, the animated scenes and art captures the elements of the era the show takes place and its characters. The second opening felt quite generic for the most part. It used uninspiring shots and cliche that we\u2019ve seen countless times in other anime. The endings for the most part are very hopeful. Let\u2019s leave it at that.\\n\\n\r\nArslan is an underrated show, I believe it is, that deserves more attention for its engaging story and the mysteries that surround the phenomenal aspects in the world of Arslan. With that said, I say it\u2019s time I give The Heroic Legend of Arslan a solid 8/10 with a Daryun seal of approval. While the cast as a whole is strong, none of the characters really stand out in face of the entire anime industry. The story has evolved into something I\u2019m curious to see but not something I\u2019d kill to know. The beginning starts off a bit generic but slowly becomes its own in a pleasant way. However even with that said, Arslan proves to be a great watch and something I can recommend if you\u2019re into the clashing of swords and arrows piercing the flesh of soldiers fighting for their cause, whether it\u2019s right or wrong. I\u2019m off to work on my comic now",

            "content": "(This is a spoiler-free review adapted for this site)\r\n[Synopsis]: At the young age of fourteen Arslan (Kobayashi, Yuusuke), the crown prince of Pars and son of King Andragoras III embarks on his maiden battle against Lusitania, a neighboring country, where he loses everything. The Lusitanian forces overwhelm the formidable Parsian army through trickery and deceit and Arslan's once glorious kingdom falls to the invaders. Bereft of both allies and a home to return to he and his trusted retainer Daryun (Hosoya, Yoshimasa) venture onward from the battle and begin gathering heroic allies to their cause in an attempt to take back Arslan's throne and recoverthe capital of Ecbatana. \\n\\n\r\n[Characters]: \\n\\n\r\nIn classic form of the historical drama genre, Arslan Senki offers a large host of characters - Arslan's own company featuring as many as seven diverse characters ranging from a master tactician in Narsus to a priestess of Misra in Farangis. With that said, the show is heavily focused on Arslan as its story most primarily concerns his growth as a person and as a leader and the actual development and characterization of those close to him and those he encounters on his journey take a back seat to this. Each individual character is introduced with a compelling enough template for them to get by within the story and a good many of them do well within the show as they are presented such as Narsus and Daryun who are appealing due to their logical thinking and overwhelming strength respectively. \\n\\n\r\nArslan himself is quite interesting in terms of characterization however the show mishandles him in some ways that ultimately cheapens his growth and maturation. In the beginning of the show we are introduced to a fledgling prince who, despite being kind and eager to learn, is ignorant of the outside world in relation to the kingdom of Pars. He is ineffective with a weapon on the battlefield and lacks faith in himself and so all in all he represents great opportunity, if not a little too obviously so, to grow as a character. The show develops him quite well at first, translating his willingness to learn and improve upon himself while still being young well into his character's actions and dialogue. One chief example of this is in his initial thoughts on slavery - rather than agree with Narsus who claims that the slaves of Pars should be freed and that it is wrongful to enslave them in the first place, he takes the sentiment into account but reserves his ultimate judgement on the matter despite feeling the same way. This reservation of character speaks volumes about Arslan in that he is aware of how ignorant he is of the greater implications of these grand decisions and his reticent attitude towards them is an engaging attribute. \\n\\n\r\nThough Arslan was characterized quite intricately early on, we see this dull over time as his beliefs become more resolute and he lacks the deliberation and carefulness he featured early on. In some ways this was a way for the show to mature him however a great many of the earlier concerns such as the implications of slavery within the kingdom are dismissed rather than decided upon in an intellectual way. Alongside this inability to follow through on earlier character traits, Arslan acts incredibly foolishly at times in part due to his kind-hearted nature combined with his initial innocence however these actions seem awkward and out of place in the latter parts of his story. I think that ultimately Arslan turned out to be an interesting character though his mismanagement hurt the show for me a good deal due to its heavy reliance on him rather than other members of the cast to produce compelling dialogue and further the story.\\n\\n\r\nTo add a quick note concerning the rest of the cast, a decent number of them are quite compelling and fit well within the world such as the enigmatic and twisted 'Silvermask' or the traveling musician and rogue Gieve however there were a choice few characters that impacted the story and the setting very poorly and damaged the cast irreparably. In the historical drama setting most of the characters presented made a lot of sense but the show also introduced a handful of characters such as Elam, Alfreed, and Etoile who felt out of place among the other cast members and within the world itself. They each occupied more typical character archetypes than the rest of the cast and the effects of seeing an otherwise engaging dialogue be thrown off by a stereotypical 'tsundere' dynamic grew increasingly more tiresome. Furthermore, these characters didn't have a whole lot of purpose behind them and it constantly felt as if events warped themselves in such a way in order to give them some form of relevance. As much as I'd like to say that the positive elements of Arslan's characterization and a few other characters made the shortcomings of these people trivial, this was not the case and they were provided with more than enough screen time to often detract from the setting and story.\\n\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]:\\n\\n\r\nWhile Arslan Senki stumbled a bit in terms of its cast and their characterization the greatest weakness of the show was in its art and animation. Though the show presented a good few scenes of high quality animation over the course of its full 25-episode run, far too many of the episodes faltered extremely noticeably in character design, movement, and general art style. This is saddened all the more by the presence of Arakawa Hiromu's designs which were otherwise quite appealing and in her classic style where the quality drops affected them to the point that the characters did not even resemble themselves at times. The art direction wasn't all that bad and there were a handful of interesting shots each episode but the execution was what truly marred the visuals of the show and the quality drops were so frequent and so noticeable that I can list no more significant and impactful shortcoming of the show than this. \\n\\n\r\nAs if to make matters worse, Arslan Senki also relied a great deal on CG in order to deliver its farther reaching scenes such as its great battles and countless banners of horsemen. Due to the historical setting of the show this was definitely a case where the usage of CG was due to either budgetary concerns or because of their difficulty of execution rather than to achieve a certain aesthetic by means of the CG. Arslan Senki did not make good use of this technique, especially early on - the CG soldiers and horses pop out of the frames far too noticeably to be forgiven and I found that they constantly broke whatever immersion the show could offer with their sharing of the same face, their robotic movement, and their general aesthetic delivery. I will give credit to the show however for its improvement in this category in the latter episodes however - while the show does not actually improve within this technical aspect it does do a far better job at times masking the presence of the CG by using fast, zooming, overhead shots of the battle and darting between the soldiers at ground-level as they clashed. The quality drops and poor implementation of CG hurt the show a good deal and I wouldn't recommend the show to anyone who gets annoyed by these things as they were highly noticeable and consistently resent.\\n\\n\r\n[Story]:\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Arslan Senki was perhaps the area in which it showed the most potential and where it most succeeded. The idea of a coming of age story involving a prince and a return to his kingdom is by no means an original story however Arslan sets itself apart in several ways by raising interesting questions early on concerning the nature of Arslan's enemy and Arslan's own lineage. Alongside this the story does a good enough job nurturing Arslan and teaching him new things in order for him to grow as a person and a leader though at times this appears a bit hamfisted but is forgivable due to the purpose of the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe story of Arslan lends itself well to its world and setting as the places and countries all feel legitimized within the plot after their introduction and the manner in which the plot unfolds was compelling enough to keep my interest even amidst the other major short comings of the show. One point of concern in respect to the world of Arslan Senki was in how it handled the presence of magic. For the most part, the world is quite like ours however the blatant appearance of something magical does not occur until nearly half way through the show. Though the presence of sorcery and the like is eluded at as early on as Arslan's maiden battle, it comes off as the kind of typical smoke and mirrors kind of magic often discussed in similar historical action shows and seeing its manifestation later on felt out of place. While there is is no rule that says that the world of Arslan should have no magic in it the way in which it is handled and introduced was problematic in my eyes as it felt inconsistent and its presence far too spread out along the length of the show to feel natural to the world setting. Hopefully the implementation of magic becomes more obvious in the future as it would work well for the show whether it is used often or not. \\n\\n\r\n[Music]:\\n\\n\r\nThe music worked well for the show and was one of the more memorable elements of it while not appealing to me beyond its own context. It was medieval, it was heroic, and the instrumentation of the soundtrack never felt out of place. Perhaps the only qualm I have in this area was that the show had a tendency to fall back into certain songs each episode that made them feel a tad overused rather than featuring other songs more often though due to the positive influence of those choice songs on the story and presentation of the show I find this fairly forgivable. \\n\\n\r\n[Final Thoughts and Rating]: \\n\\n\r\nArslan Senki was certainly a mix of pros and cons all throughout and I think it can be summarized as a show with great ideas, an interesting premise, and an awesome art style that was executed poorly. Arslan was interesting even given his less than stellar characterization as he offered a very explicit and intricate way of thinking that I found appealing and this trait won out for me over his negative attributes. Similarly, the plot of the show kept me watching despite the many production issues and visual problems the show exhibited and so I have to admit that I found the show at least compelling to the point that I could tolerate its flaws rather than dismiss them. I think, if the show does receive a future installment which it very likely could due to the length of its source material, it could turn out quite well if the production value was increased. \\n\\n\r\nRating: 6\\n\\n\r\nI gave Arslan Senki a 6 primarily because the plot intrigued me enough to keep watching and by means of its occasional mystery elements it set itself far enough apart from other similar stories to avoid becoming forgettable. I can't find it in myself to rate the show any higher as its visuals were lacking in the extreme and a small number of the characters from the cast were infuriating in their design and personality in such a way that they majorly detracted from certain character relationships and dialogue exchanges. \\n\\n\r\n[Recommendations]:\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend Arslan Senki to any fans of the historical action genre as it exemplifies all of the conflicts, intrigues, and settings that make the genre interesting. The action of the show is quite good and there were a handful of beautiful action scenes sprinkled throughout the show however elsewhere the choreography was lacking and the animation poor and so I wouldn't cite these choice few triumphs as reason enough for one to pick up the show due to its action alone. To go hand in hand with my comments from earlier, I wouldn't recommend the show to anyone who is bothered extensively by quality drops as it was far and away the biggest problem for the show and even a novice of the medium will be able to pick out the differences in quality from shot to shot due to their overt nature.",

            "content": "This anime is forever going to be one of my favorites. Mind you, I started watching it from the very beginning with very high expectations because, well, Hiromu Arakawa. Then I realized that it was more similar to Fullmetal Alchemist not only in art but in terms of the story than I initially thought. Though it is a remake of a series of OVA which was based off a novel, this new version is a much crisper, much more dynamic anime than its predecessor. \r\nThe characters are very enjoyable \u2013 both in their design and the way they evolve throughout the story. Particularly Narsus andDaryun, who are both amazing in their own ways (and funny as well). My only critique is the over-sexualization of some female characters (namely, Farangis and the Queen of Pars), but what can you do? It's anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is absolutely fantastic \u2013 the OST and the OP/ED songs are all very enjoyable to listen to. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I think Arslan Senki has lots of potential for season 2 and I cannot wait for it to come out whenever it does. If you like adventure animes were friendship tends to save the day more often than not, this is a must-see.",

The best way to describe Arslan is that it is a smartly written and extremely fun adventure. For the most part, the characters are simple, but they are all likable, funny, bad ass, or just plain cool enough that you won't care that they are not the most complex charactersin the world. Watching the cast of heroes interact with each other and the adventures they go on are all fun to watch. The series does some deeper aspects like a villain with surprisingly good motivations, a lot of interesting political and strategic maneuvering, and some thoughtful commentary about our history.\\n\r\nThe animation and music are both very good, with the exception of some CGI that looks a bit questionable, but honestly that is more of a nitpick. The show has a fun group of main characters, good action, some nice humor, some surprisingly good romance, some bad ass moments, and a lot of really fun adventure.\\n\r\nIf you are looking for a fantasy or adventure series that knows when it has to be deep and emotional, and when it can just be an entertaining adventure then I couldn''t recommend The Heroic Legend of Arslan highly enough.",

            "content": "This is a decent fantasy anime that both eschews and embodies many of the issues common to fantasy anime.\r\nFor one thing, drawing on ancient Persia as a setting is a very cool choice, as it's fairly underutilized and lends the show a fresh and exotic coat of paint. On the other hand it does fall into the typical anime-set-in-the-pre-modern-era trap of grotesque historically inaccuracy when it comes to numbers and scale: expect big battles with classical era armies somehow consisting of hundreds of thousands of men.\r\nBut that's not really a strong criticism, given that it is a fantasy anime, and historical inaccuracies like that don'treally have much impact on the overall quality, they are more of a personal peeve. What does detract greatly from the show is how horrible these massive battles look. Every battle scene gives you long panning views of big, grotesque CGI armies, of copy pasted spearmen and knights. It looks absolutely terrible, but fortunately these large battles are used sparingly - when the show recedes in scale and settles into a more conventional fantasy story scale of a small party of people, the animation is no longer an issue, and the characterisation and pacing shines.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters aren't groundbreaking or deep by any means, but they do fill their archetypes well and act consistently. The cast is a little oversaturated, meaning some accessory characters are starved for screen time and some early prominent ones become basically side characters, but even in their limited exposure they make enough of an impression to still feel like actual characters.\\n\\n\r\nHowever the pervasive cancer of boring shonen morality mars any thematic depth this series might have. Arslan discusses slavery with all the nuance of dismemberment. There is a flagrant ethical code transposed from contemporary society and applied to this setting, in order to win the viewers sympathy and support for the protagonist. \\n\\n\r\nWhile this does not ruin the adventure or fun in this show, it does prevent it from feeling like a really special pseudo historical drama. Which is fine, as it never really tries to be outside of phonetic references to real world historical locations and titles.\\n\\n\r\nI would definitely recommend this series to anyone who enjoys historical fantasy with minimal fantastical elements, especially if they have a love of romanticism in their fiction.",

One of the reasons I love this anime is that the main character (Arslan) isn't just the stereotypical \"strongest of them all\" character, but a young boy. Many of the characters aren't entirely good or bad either, which makes it interesting.\r\n*Next part may contain minor spoilers\r\nThe only fault for this anime however, is that the tactician (Narsus) is able to predict everything, which became a little boring after a while. The battle strategies always went soothly and exactly ashe planned it to go. This made him a little too perfect, with Arslan being able to go to him to solve every problem he encountered. \\n\\n\r\nOverall however, I greatly enjoyed watching this anime and hope that the 3rd season comes out soon!! :)",

            "content": "Arslan Senki is the kind of show that I didn't really appreciate fully until I had finished the last episode. It was a good show and I enjoyed every episode I watched, but I rarely found myself hyped to watch the next episode. It wasn't until the end that I sat back and realized how enjoyable the entire show as a whole was even though it was really slow-paced.\r\n The story is your typical \"fight for your right to the throne\" angle with the righteous versus the not-so-righteous. The story doesn't do much early on as it mostly spends the first half introducing all thecharacters in Arslan's party and developing them. The story really begins to pick up about halfway through though because once the characters and the two sides of the fight for the throne are well established, the large-scale battles begin. The story itself gets better each episode, as plot points such as questions about Arslan's legitimacy to the throne (he is a green-eared 14 year old after all) and the danger of other parties getting involved in what should be a two-sided war between Lusitania and Pars are introduced to add some flavor to what is usually a rather bland story setting. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the strongest characteristics of the show is how it handles all the battles. Early on, the main characters are very often outnumbered or in a bad position and it takes careful planning and cunning strategy to win their battles. Once the large battles begin in the second half, that same strategic approach to each battle still holds true. There's no rage-mode power-ups, no \"protagonist arrives at the last second to save the day\" moments, or things like that. Each side's strategists lay out a realistic battle plan and execute it, and the strategy that is better executed wins. The downside to the fights is that it never really felt like Arslan and his party were ever in any true danger of losing- even when they were vastly outnumbered. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are good overall, but some of them are hit-or-miss. Arslan is hard not to like. He's extremely good-natured and cares for his subordinates, and his wish to reclaim the throne is based more off of what he hopes to accomplish for the people than it is about whether or not he deserves the throne in the first place. Daryun, his right-hand man, is possibly the strongest character on the show and his fights never fail to impress. Narsus is the brilliant strategist who has a love for painting despite the fact he is terrible at it. Elam is Narsus' apprentice and the group's trap and recon specialist. Farangis is a beautiful archer woman who follows Arslan despite not being a Parsian. Gieve is a comical musician who loves women. Alfreed is the daughter of a bandit-chieftain and loves Narsus while having a healthy rivalry with Elam. \\n\r\nAll of these characters are likeable but only Narsus, Gieve, and Arslan really feel developed. Farangis is honestly little more than fan service, and Elam and Alfreed don't do much besides fight for Narsus' attention. Daryun is just hopelessly powerful and outside of teasing Narsus for being a bad painter, offers little beyond his fighting ability. \\n\\n\r\nThe art on the show is average across the board. There's never a moment where it really looks bad, but there's also never a moment where it looks especially good. It is consistent at the very least. The characters are well-done and the animation of the large army-on-army fights is done very well. The landscapes are often times below average quality. The animation for the one-on-one sword fights is also very good. It's mostly just the lack of detail they put into the environments that is really in the bad area- most everything else is either average or good.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound on the show is one of the strong points. Both of the OPs were among the best of their respective seasons, and the endings were solid but not great. None of the battle music or anything was really memorable, but it all fit really well into the setting. Most of the music just flowed nicely alongside the clashing of swords and stomping of hooves; it did a good job of just simply doing its job. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I really did enjoy Arslan Senki. The first half was slow, but the second half had a good number of pivotal moments and was set up well by the slow-going first half. The story is surprisingly engaging considering how predictable it is. The show does a good job of making sure what is on-screen is entertaining even though you know what is going to happen next. The characters were overall likeable despite half of the main party not really getting any development, but the roster overall was actually pretty strong. The animation and art were consistent and the fights looked nice, but the environment quality was really lacking. The sound was very good despite not being memorable. I'd definitely recommend this anime to anybody, especially if that person likes medieval-style settings or battles that are based more on strategy than power. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8:10",

            "content": "Plot and Story Line\r\nYou know, I sometimes really get surprised by the ratings on MAL. Arslan Senki is ranked as #643 and has a rating of only 7,91. An Adventure, Action, Historical and Fantasy anime like this really deserves a higher ranking. \r\n\"The Heroic Legend of Arslan\" takes place in the prosperous kingdom of Pars. In the kingdom's capital Ecbatana the young Prince Arslan is growing up and taught how to become a good future ruler like his fearsome and undefeated father, King Andragoras. But despite all his effort,  Arslan doesn't seem to have what it takes to become a real ruler. \r\nAs a14-Year-Old-Boy, Arslan goes to his first battle where he confronts defeat, loosing nearly everything he'd got. Together with Daryun, a high-ranked officer of the Parsian army, he escapes the battlefront and begins his journey and our adventure. His mission, taking back his empire, and becoming the ruler of Pars. \\n\r\nThe first thing you would think, oh it's again one of that stories where the prince needs to take back his kingdom from the bad guys. It is in one way, but there are many other paths that this anime takes until the very end. The main story line does follow Arslan's way to a great leader, but with the episodes more characters and background stories are introduced making this anime so good as it is. \\n\r\nWhen talked about the main plot, it does kinda look cliche, but it kinda surprises you with every episode that follows. You always have that thoughts: \"No Arslan, please!\" or \"Why are you...ah, never mind\"!. And despite everything you continue watching because it is so interesting. And also, the thing I found so good about this anime is how it makes you think about the connections to real kingdoms from the past. If only every History lesson had been animated, maybe I would have even tried to study it. Also one of my good friends started watching it, and liked it mainly because of this historical connections.  The main story appears to be a cliche story you've already seen before, but is actually an intriguing, awesome and interesting story due to all the various characters that get engaged by the time, together with their skill, characteristics and special appeal. \\n\r\nIn addition to this epic story comes also a lot of action with action-loaded fights that really make you fall in love with Arslan Senki more and more. You have the strong and irreplaceable warrior Daryun, the brilliant tactician Narsus, the strong and beautiful Falangies and much more Arslan's fellows that help him on his way back to the throne. \\n\r\nTrue it does not surprise me since the producer of Arslan Senki are the same producers of well known anime like Attack on Titan, Fullmetal Alchemist, Code Geass, The Blue Exorcist, Darker than Black, Angel Beats etc. \\n\r\nAnd for the end of this review section I want to mention the favorite thing about Arslan Senki. The plot twists and \"story surprises\". The interesting thing is that these are definitely immense twist and enormous surprises but they don't come that suddenly. They kinda make their way slowly into the story. It does not come like a lone BOOM!, but more like a Drum-Roll with a BANG! at the end. ( I really have ridiculous ways of describing things). I hope you get what I am trying to say. \\n\r\nIn short, Arslan Senki is an interesting and epic story you really shouldn't miss. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nIt is again one of these anime where it is hard to take just a few characters to talk about. If I discussed every important character from this anime I would go on talking until the morning. I really would like to talk about Falanies, Gieve, Alfreed etc, but let's just concentrate on these three:\\n\\n\r\nARSLAN is our main character in the story. As a kid Arslan has always been very cute and curious always wanting to explore and learn more. Arslan is also a very naive and gentle person that always thinks in an optimistic way. Even though  Arslan doesn't look like the strongest warrior, he has a great heart for every person, even for his enemies. He is an intelligent and charismatic young boy that has his whole life in front of him. But the thing that fascinates me the most about Arslan is that despite being 14, Arslan still behaves in a mature way, whether it is about his kingdom, war or just relationships with people around him. In the end I want to say that Arslan is definitely my favorite main character so far. \\n\\n\r\nDARYUN is the strongest warrior of the story. Not only is he strong, and very skillful, he is also very clever and intelligent always trying to find the best way to win. His main task in the anime is to protect Arslan, and you can clearly see his passion and loyalty trough the whole anime. He does take his \"job\" very serious, and so he doesn't let other emotions out. That's the thing I kinda didn't like about the character of Daryun. We don't get to know the Daryun that lies beneath the armor. I hope the next season brings us more information about Daryun or a good background story about his past. \\n\\n\r\n NARSUS is the character I love the most in this anime. He is so quick-witted and crazy, yet so skillful and smart. Not smart, brilliant. He is the tactician of every battle \\n\r\nalways outsmarting the opponent. He does look like he is hiding something, something about him is mysterious but I can't grasp it. And that's exactly what makes him so interesting, and makes me love him so much. And by the way, who would have ever thought that the only wish of the once well known chief adviser of Pars would be to become the royal painter. He is such a cool guy and trust me you'll love him. Can't wait to see what will happen to him in the next season. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\r\nArslan Senki has a great animation, which is in my opinion a not so surprising fact because it is a 2015 anime. It is awesome and the style is perfect.\\n\r\nI loved the landscapes and the looks of all the castles and backgrounds. I really don't know what to write in this section. Here is a cute pic for you (xD). \\n\r\nWell, if I may add I loved the second opening. Here a You Tube link if you want to see..",

            "content": "*This review takes consideration of the 2nd season*\r\nDENKA! DENKA! DENKA! DENKA!\r\nThis anime aims for that historical fantasy world where 'massive' or 'epic' fits perfectly; shown through its huge army battles, the large scale strategies and tactics of war, the heavy politics of land and rule, and the importance of leaders in the fight for faction objectives.\r\nOur main cast surrounds Prince Arslan and his close court of leaders. I struggle in describing them as under Arslan because that is what makes him different to the other heads of the world.\r\nWhile inexperienced and rather dependent, Arslan has an opened eyed outlook to his people and of others.It's from his equality world policy and good mentality that makes people wish to serve him. For example, the biggest upset for others of power against him is that he wishes to abolish slavery.\\n\r\nHe slowly grows in understanding, in strength, and in power, while making sure that what he does is what he believes to be good.\\n\r\nThis of course, includes the amazing support he has from his allies, each who are unique and shown to be just as important as him. The uplifting camaraderie as they travel is always fun to see.\\n\\n\r\nIt reminds me of why I love the Fire Emblem series so much; all these individuals who can make a nation great while showing why they themselves are so special to the masses and to each other.\\n\\n\r\nNot only do I love the characters, my ears surrender in joy and my mind gets grabbed of it's attention whenever I hear its soundtrack. Those songs still speak power in my memories. They fit the world and the settings so well.\\n\\n\r\nMy mother called it the Lord of the Rings anime, in the sense of all the different armies, the massive battles and the important fights and individuals seen inside them. Even country to country, culture and politics, lands to travel, its all so grandeur and large.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, I fall back to describe it as large or epic, straying away from typical small cast of 4 or 5 friends squabbling over small things. Every piece on this chessboard has meaning and purpose.\\n\\n\r\nA fair warning to those who hate CGI in anime, while I'm not personally bothered by its uses, it wasn't exactly synergistic at times in its scenes.\\n\r\nAs well as the second season which threw its budget efforts at even more CGI animation at the sacrifice of having only 8 episodes, a glaring difference to the 25 it has at the start.\\n\\n\r\nStill, I do believe the pacing to remain unhurt, one gets a sense of progression and accomplishment as Arslan commands his army. Taken in by its historical life and thirsting for it thanks to all those similar Chinese movies my dad has shown me (Oh you know the ones.), its an amazing watch to see a country in action.",

Or why are some characters too overpower?\r\nThe anime does really conect with the World History, I am talking about the cristianismo and the realtionship against some religions in the region of the Constantine Empire.\r\nBut in general it is a good anime, it could be better if it were more realistic in combat andwar.",

            "content": "Arslan Senki Anime Review Season 1\r\nOVERALL: 9/10\r\nPLOT: 8/10\r\nThe story focuses on a young prince who has been somewhat driven out of his kingdom due to some incident in the past. This story mainly focuses on how will he manage to get the kingdom back and make the right choices to change the bad ways and rules that the previous generation takes. I won't say that this story is a unique one because fighting over a crowse is quite common in a monarchy, I think. What I'm interested the most is that origin of Prince Arslan which specifically not tackled in this season. I doubt thathe is the son of Andragoras and his queen. However, there might be something in the past which leads to him being the prince. I love this anime, mainly maybe because it is historical. The action on it is also good and how every character choose whomever they believe also affects plot. It comes to the point where they needed to pick on being on the right side eventhough it is doubtful. Or pick on the wrong side just because it is a must. I do love the strategy used by the characters, the way they overcome any incidents and the way human think on certain situations that doesn't benefit them. For me, the season 1 successfully hang the viewers leaving questions on their mind. There are so many questions which needed a clear answer which I know will be answered at the possibly next season. How I hope for that.\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 8/10\\n\r\nI love the characters. I love Daryun, Narsus and Gieve. Haha. \\n\r\nWell, the strongest one, the intelligent and the handsome one are always the character who get an appreaciation, isn't it? \\n\r\nHowever, the protagonist which we can see in other anime series and stories is always the weak one. The helpless one. What I think in my character view is lacking is the softness of Arslan. He is too dense or too weak that he is always needing the help of his subordinates. Well, maybe I'm just expecting him to show something which is new since it is a common thing to be helpless in an adventure genre if you are the protagonist. But there are some scenes where I so love his character, the time where he get mad when one of his subordinate is in danger. I do want to watch some more of it. I understand that he is young and a heavy burden was placed on his shoulder. However, I am still wanting more expression from him.\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 10/10\\n\r\nI enjoyed watching this series, really. I love historical anime. Much more, I am feeling the same kind of joy in watching it. It has the same aura as Akatsuki No Yona which is my favorite one. I was also awed at every fighting in this series. The movement is very detailed for me. As well as the expression of the characters who is fighting. There's no certain word I can think of to express that I really love this anime, also. Swear!\\n\r\nENDING: 9/10\\n\r\nDo you know the feeling when you're already too excited on what is happening on the series you are watching? Then as the episodes gone by, you realize that you will be hanged? All the question you have left unanswered. You want more but you can't always gave what you want. Watching this anime feels like I've just read a prologue of a book or story. The story starts in the ending. Well, I still love this ankme even if I have to wait for the next season. I just need to know where is Gieve. Just kidding.",

            "content": "The Heroic Legend of Arslan was, for me, an enjoyable show, but ultimately not a very good one. The show never does anything so badly that it becomes straight-up horrible, but it also suffers from too many problems for me to give it a solid recommendation. The show starts out with great potential for a sweeping, epic story of politics and war, but ultimately devolves into a series of predictable events with two-dimensional and absurdly overpowered characters.\r\nFor the first half of the show, events proceed in a (relatively) believable and intriguing fashion. The concept of a prince forced out of his kingdom setting out ona quest to reclaim his lands is not a bad one to start from, and could lead to a number of interesting political issues, intriguing characters, and epic battles. I personally am I quite the fan of well-written epic stories, and I was hoping that Arslan Senki would proceed in this direction. During the first half of the show, the story was at least enjoyable and interesting, although hampered by some character issues I will get into later. However, by the time the second half of the show came around, it became increasingly clear that the show was less interested in displaying an epic and complex tale and more interested in a series of predictable and repetitive battles. The narrative stakes in the story end up quickly vanishing almost completely at this point because Arslan's army of character he has gathered prove themselves to be so absurdly overpowered that they make it through battles with ease. The show never takes the opportunity to give Arslan a real obstacle in his quest- he and his army simply overpower everything in their path. I found this to be very unfortunately and a waste of the legitimate potential the series have.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Arslan Senki prove themselves to be as problematically predictable and straightforward as the story. Many of the villains are so over the top that they become ridiculous, a problem that affects even the relatively decent first half of the show. As for Arslan's army, each of the characters he encounters tends to have one or two traits that make up their entire personality. Daryun, his bodyguard, is the stereotypical loyal soldier, his tactician Narsus is the endlessly resourceful, refined noble, and so on. None of the characters ever truly change or develop, which is particularly problematic in the case of Arslan himself. I have read that many do not like Arslan at the start of the anime, as he is portrayed as relatively timid and insecure, yet idealistic and caring. Honestly, I have no problem with this. I personally tend to be far more annoyed by brash and hot-headed types of characters that by ones like Arslan. However, the problem is that his personality never really changes throughout the story. He does not necessarily have to become a harsh or overly assertive person to be a good leader, but he consistently shows a heavy degree of naivete throughout the show that one would think he would eventually outgrow. However, this never happens, leaving him a static character and ultimately an uninteresting one.\\n\\n\r\nWhile watching Arslan Senki, I legitimately enjoyed parts of it. I initially found the battles and struggles between different powers in Arslan's world intriguing. The characters were certainly nothing special, but were at least serviceable. Perhaps Arslan Senki's biggest problem is that it ultimately stagnates, never really moving on from the same kind of formula seen early in the show, merely repeating the same events again and again. Overall, I will not call Arslan Senki a terrible show or even a bad one. It is instead a mediocre show that could have been much more.",

            "content": "Arslan Senki is *arguably* one of the best of the select few animes that has military & strategic planning involved. Not to mention that it actually has a plot to work with even though it may appear to be quite shaky. There are tons of aspects that may be pointed out that may ruin the show for many, but that does not mean it can be considered as garbage. According to my standards, it scores pretty good in general.\r\nTo start with, let's talk about the \"plot.\" Considering that this isn't really one of those shows that expressly states what the series is about, it isable to let the audience get the gist of story even at the pilot episode. The series did well in terms of plot progression even though it got derailed several times for world building and character development. I commend its author for writing up a story that actually makes sense when it involves war and politics.\\n\\n\r\nAnother great aspect of this show is its character and character development. The only downside is that most of these characters are geniuses or exemplified warriors. They are so strong, up to a point that it's absurd how most of them can destroy their enemies because of \"natural talent\" or \"divine protection.\" These characters are unique, but I can't say that they don't fall into particular archetypes. One thing is for sure though, the series didn't lag behind when it comes to character development. So you can look forward to that, especially when the series is nearing its end.\\n\\n\r\nNext up is its art and animation. I have no qualms about its art, but I have to mention that it is very similar to one Anime (FMA-B, if you know it). With regard to animation, it seemed okay with me when it came to general scenes and battles. It is acceptable even though they used CGI most of the time (general and/or extra characters), because the animation was definitely amazing when it needed to look amazing.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the sound aspect, there's nothing to worry about. It may be generic every now and then, but most of the voice actors are widely known--so that's a bonus.\\n\\n\r\nGenerally speaking, Arslan Senki has basically all of these things: plot, plot armor, eye candy, cliches, military strategems, dark magic, black/dark knight, cross-dressers, tsunderes, a kuudere, a giant noob, annoying characters, annoying extras, funny moments, mind-blowing moments, \"wtf moments,\" and a lot of other things.\\n\\n\r\nStory7/10 (2.8)\\n\r\nCharacter5/10 (1.25)\\n\r\nArt / A 5/10( 1)\\n\r\nSound 4/10 (0.6)\\n\r\n5.65/10=>6\\n\\n\r\nBarely made it to the point where it's worth a watch, if you ask me. Although, unlike most shows, this one is enjoyable enough that you might binge watch all episodes in a day. (entertainment value isn't factored into rating because it depends on personal preferences, thus the score 6/10.)",

            "content": "If you've seen Yona of the Dawn and Tales of the Abyss you'd have a pretty good handle on how this story plays out. One thing that's different about either of those shows is that the main character isn't intensely unlikable in the first episode. The King and Queen are rather cold toward our Prince and indeed seem to ignore most of the time. He tries to live up to their expectations and do the right thing (which isn't always the same thing), which is a nice bend on the genre of deposed royalty trying to regain power. Another strong point of this anime isthat he actually LISTENS to his advisors to not do stupid, crazy things like charge at the head of an army because he will be killed (he really would). \\n\\n\r\nThe anime is nondescript. There is a lot of CGI when there are massive battles, but raging about that is a losing battle (heh). At least it gives you an idea of scope instead of just really close up still motion fights with lots of yelling.\\n\\n\r\nWhat loses points for me is the worldbuilding was imperfect. Throughout the first...12 episodes of the anime it looked as if there was no overt magic aside from the generic \"legends and prophecies\" stuff they generally have in fantasy stories. Suddenly there's a guy who can teleport anywhere and attack. Then we find out that one of the main group is protected by a god and can calmly walk into a hail of arrows and none will touch her...and so can the person she designates. \\n\\n\r\nTension broken. At this point I'm just trying to reshape how the world looks and operates. It's a bit like if you're watching a noire detective story and suddenly aliens show up in the middle of it. Yes, you could have both a mystery and aliens, but it's kinda startling to have ZORG from BLXKSLJF be part of the mystery in the final few chapters. No, I don't accept it.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the bad guy also has some Bond villain level of stupidity. He's on the cusp of winning or killing someone twice and goes \"Eeeeh, no. It's not 'the right time' or 'you aren't scared of me enough' and just...DOESN'T KILL THEM. WHY?\\n\\n\r\nThis is lazy writing.\\n\\n\r\nThe other thing I hated about this anime was the sound engineering. I watching the anime and someone started to pound on the drums. The sound mixing was jarring, the sound of each drum began and ended fairly sharply, as if it wasn't an actual drum but a midi file being played in a loop and not properly overlapping the next one. That may seem minor compared to the rest but it really was jarring and distracting when the sound doesn't come together.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I'd say it's not worth watching yet as the second season isn't complete yet and there's no telling how silly this will go, but once the second season is out it might be interesting to see. The main character is a white hat who is supposedly not very good at fighting but is able to survive all battles as an untried warrior with no major injuries at all and has a near-invincible guardian who shows up at all times to save him.",

The use of CG is fairly noticeable, but I didn't think detracted from the story, and even though the main group of characters are too OP to be real people I found myself rooting for the main group the entire time.  \r\nAfter readingthe wiki I can see that they did have this series plotted as two long OVAs, which I will watch next because the main vibe I get from this story is that this would have made a much better series of movies like Berserk than an anime.\\n\r\nThere is one thing that I found utterly unacceptable, and can't for the life of my figure out how the animators thought it would be cool to add in.  So minor ----SPOILERS---- but seriously how the fuck does a horse JUMP on top of an elephant, like WTF how does that even happen.  If you look at the height of an elephant standing next to the other characters how on godly hell does a horse jump up that high.  I'm sure the animators thought it was cool, and then they got the horse up there and it doesn't even DO ANYTHING, it just jumps right off...... like WTF man, why make your horse do that when you could have ridden next to the elephant, climbed up it's side, and then fought on top of the elephant.... Was that really necessary to make your horse jump up on it's head???!!  ----\\n\r\nEnd of minor rant.----  I'm sorry. Anyway, if you have spare time and like the fantasy-shonen themes in this anime watch it, but if you can't deal with the minor weird details that make it unrealistic (ahem the elephant) then I'd suggest stay away.",

            "content": "It's a good anime, but it lacks emotion, good story but without something big that causes impact, \r\nthere are many mistakes and something was forgotten in history, \r\nThe characters are nice, but they lack history and developments\r\nit is very predictable and cliche In many scenes, the Prince 'Arslan' does not do anything and is not frustrated by being weak in wanting something better for himself.\r\n He is always protected when in danger, always being saved, the script is weak and \r\ntotally predictable - Adventures are cool, not a Bad Anime, \r\nHad the potential to be better but..\r\nThe season 2 proves the mistakes, lost the wayonly 8 episodes and totally meaningless.\\n\\n\r\nJust my opinion respect to all, and srry my f*** english .",
