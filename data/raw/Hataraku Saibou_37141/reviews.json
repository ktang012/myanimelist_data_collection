            "content": "Cells At Work is an educational series about how the human body functions on cellular level. Its source material was originally released in the Japanese science magazine called Gross Biological Stuff and Geeky Nerdy Shit Weekly, now made into an anime format to ensure the misinformation of this shonen comedy reaches a wider audience. \r\nI refuse to use the reddit meme phrase \"\"as a\" biology major\" to back up my rhetoric with titles -- moreover, majoring biology requires bit more than reading 3 wikipedia articles about cells -- so instead I will say this series has a pretty interesting take on something that could becalled pseudo-science. I am still deeply disappointed that this wasn't like 'Moyashimon' -- the most accurate series about agriculture ever created, or like 'Once Upon a Time...Life' -- the French animation franchise produced in the 70's and 80's, \"Life\" being only one of the many parts of it. Instead, we have a comedy series that can be enjoyed the best by completely excluding its settings. However, I like comedy as well... unfortunately, that's where this show really flops. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening song (lyrics and opening animation) alone are the perfect alarm to everyone who expected this to meet the shonen demographics as this is the most childish shit opening I recall ever seeing. Turns out the series is not much better. \\n\\n\r\nOur story centers around this female red blood cell who never finds her way to where she is supposed to go because she is dumb, and this white blood cell dude who is always at the right place at the right time like the hero he is. Reddo girl runs from place to another and discovers bacteria and whatever nasty shit, followed by mr. white rekking them like he is Saitama from One Punch Man. That's pretty much the entirety of the series as it is nothing but below average fighting tournament shonen disrespecting its settings with references that only appear smart to people who aren't -- and centering around 2 extremely uninteresting characters. None of this would be a problem if the series was clearly aimed for children, but unfortunately all of this is just childish: great many children shows are more mature than this, moreover, children series tend to have charm which this one is missing completely. \\n\\n\r\nI am personally huge fan of Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, but after constantly witnessing barely mediocre series from David Production, I am starting to think they will be one franchise miracle and not much more. Cells at Work's biggest achievement is strengthening this thought. This is the seasonal anime series that I really wanted to like. Unfortunately that has proven to be hard because it sucks. I can recommend seasonal anime watchers to watch the first episode and decide after that if this is worth of it or not, but personally, I say it's not worth much. \\n\\n\r\n*edit, changed one word to less offensive form",

            "content": "\"The human body is the best work of art.\" - Jess C. Scott\r\nScience is the study of everything around us. From the early stages of our universe, to the ancient civilizations in the past that leads us to our modern and technological society. Then we come to society. What makes a society even? The people. Humanity have transcended and evolved for generations and generations and will continue evolving like an endless cycle of life.\r\nWhat does a human compose of? Cells, organs, organ system, tissues, atoms, molecules, ions and so on and so forth. This things, particularly the cells, are the ones that keeps on givinghumanity life as we know it. From RBCs transporting oxygen throughout the body, to the WBCs fighting and defending our body against foreign invaders. Truly, the human body is indeed the best work of art. And then an anime based on this heroic beings finally aired this Summer 2018 as being one of the unique anime this season.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThis anime \"Cells At Work.\" doesn't have a chronological order in terms of the plot because, as we know it, the story of it is about the cells of our body. What they do against diseases, injuries and other life-threatening phenomenons that can happen to our body. Each character or cells of the story contributes on every episode because of their functionality. For example, the Blood Circulation episode which is of course mainly for Red Blood Cell, while the Thymocytes episode is about the childhood life of Killer, Regular, and Helper T Cell. We get to know on each episode how artistic, beautiful and smart the author of Cells At Work manga (which the anime based on) in plotting out different things about the cells different capabilities based on their real life counterpart. It is honestly very hard to make a manga or anime out of this characters as cells on our body are really hard to describe on, draw to different anime characters and have traits on them contributing to a anime world full of cells. For example, White Blood Cell (Neutrophil) is killing those bacteria, viruses or any type of foreign invaders with a knife and sprayin them afterwards. That is one of the smart moves I've seen that the author applied to be on an anime character because if they base it on the real WBC then it will just look.... weird and hideous as the WBC on our body actually engulfs and then digests the invader with enzymes, powerful enough to kill it (Phagocytosis). Another example of how the anime presented White Blood Cells' migration process to being like them passing through pipes and killing the enemy. Another smart move of the author is the settings and environment of the story. I love how each place whether it is the heart, lungs, or even the stomach have details that we viewers can understand and is accurate to the real life progression of this organs. From the heart being like a temple/shrine depicting how holy or important it is to the normal places where cells are on their apartment buildings, its easy to say the artist of the anime or manga really work so hard on this anime. We also cannot forget how the anime have some comedic elements revolving the adventures of the Red Blood Cell. This element is not that important but if you look at it, it does as it makes the show more entertaining not overall being a show to present only what cells are doing. It also have dramatic elements from the fight scenes and especially the Cancer episode. Who would've thought some of us audience gets pity on cancer just because how dramatic the scene was. Another great factor of Cells At Work is that it is an educational anime where everyone can watch it even though you have a failing grade in Biology or you just hate it. It provides small and summarized text about a certain cell, method, disease and pathogens which makes it very informative not only fun to watch. Overall, the story's accuracy comparing it to the real life cells and systems are just a masterpiece to look at as well as its representation of the cells on their role on any biological terms (or the episodes).\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nIn terms of characters, we get to see alot of characters here since this is literally about your body which comprimises of trillions of cells. Its diversity of characters, fitting them all together with no one being as important as any one because of their functions makes the show a worth to watch if you're interest is Biology. We have the RBC's who carry oxygen through our body, WBC that defends us from pathogens as well as Macrophages, T-Cells, B-Cell and NK-Cell. (there are alot more so I ain't going to list those cells). Then the pathogens either a virus, bacteria or even cancer have roles to the story depending on the episode where they shine to be the antagonist threatening our human body. What I like about the characters is that even though they all have different purposes, on some instances everyone needs to be there, working out together to counter either a scrape wound, virus attack or cancer. I can say as well that we humans are the hidden characters as well on the story. Why? Because if you take a look at the episodes of Cells At Work, on some instances, our cells cannot do anything on their own. For example, the heat stroke episode, where every cell in the body are already dying of heat and just praying for the heavens to rain and then suddenly a big tube coming from the heavens showed up to provide a solution to our body (Transfusion). Hence, characters in Cells At Work is literally just your heroic cells but turn into a more artistic view on TV.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nSince the producer of this anime is David Production, which is the company that made Jojo's art phenomenal, I can see some instances that the art is reflected to Jojos'. For example is the faces of the Killer T-Cells and White Blood Cell, especially when Naive T-Cell turned into a bulky man. The visuals of the anime are really well-done and fits its theme. Who knew Platelets can be this cute?.. Aside from it being well-done, the art of the settings like I said earlier are a genius way to represent the human body systems in a manner that everyone can understand. Not like showing some microscopic things that we the audience that are not professionals on the field of Biology cannot understand at all. Its creativity on everything along with the character designs already a worth to watch anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI cannot stress out how much I love the Opening and Ending of this show. The opening is really catchy. Having lyrics about the cells on how they work and work and we see them doing their functions on the opening is a great way to start or introduce the characters. The ending song is probably my most favorite by ClaRiS so far. It is a song where you can sing along (well you can try even if you don't know japanese) and it makes you feel really joyful. It is also a song to take away your stress. No issues at all on the background music as they all fit the sequence.\\n\\n\r\nOverall thoughts and Enjoyment:\\n\r\nAs a student who loves studying Biology, I totally enjoyed this show. The fact that anime can transcend even into our bloodstream is just amazing when you look at it. I always have the moment of excitement when I watch this because I can relate some of what's happening because of Biology class. It is very creative, very well-done and a masterpiece. This shows that anime can literally make everything good. Overall, I really really love this show and it is such a fine work of art as well as a masterpiece. I recommend you to watch this if you like a summarize version of what's happening on our human body everyday.\\n",

            "content": "It\u2019s almost impossible to ignore biology when it comes to the human body. Hataraku Saibou (Cells at Work!) has the confidence to be its own series. It\u2019s like you take the cartoony Osmosis & Jones and turns it into an educational exploration. The human body is complex and that alone really made me wonder how this show could capture its magic.\r\nI\u2019d say making this show takes a creative mind and the audience should feel connected when watching this anime. Right from the start, the show reveals the human body and what it\u2019s made up of which is essentially red blood cells. It takes place inan anonymous person but one should presume that it\u2019s healthy until it faces conflicts inside. This is where the meat of the show really comes in. The human body is vulnerable and we face consequences every day in our lives.\\n\\n\r\nBut that\u2019s not really the problem, is it? The main course of the anime is composed of human body anatomy. Main characters are composed of Red Blood Cells, in particular one girl voiced by Kana Hanazawa. There\u2019s also a variety of others cells that includes white blood, Killer-T, Macrophage, Memory, and in general, the types that you\u2019d find in any human body. Let\u2019s face it, our human body is made up of trillion of cells. Every cell has its own role whether it\u2019s providing oxygen, getting rid of carbon dioxide, or muscle strengthening. Manga creator Akane Shimizu made this work through innovative thoughts of the actions going on in our bodies.\\n\\n\r\nWith 6+ volumes and counting, the show is only consists of 13 episodes. It became obvious that the story had to limit itself with exploring the full potential of what the human body can do. However, I will say right off the bat that this shouldn\u2019t be something to overlook. Because the more I watched this show, the more I realized how informative it can be. Surprisingly enough, the details of the human body is explored with an accurate representation. There\u2019s information that details with the context of the cells while also examining at the invaders that enters our body. This include germs, virus, and any foreign pathogen that threatens a person. From the first few episodes alone, we realize that our human body is very vulnerable if we don\u2019t take care of it. God gave us our bodies but didn\u2019t make us immortal. Hataraku Saibou definitely shows why.\\n\\n\r\nNaturally, anyone coming into this show should be wondering how the plot will be structured. While not following a direct linear plot, there\u2019s common recurring themes with pathogens invading the human body. The major selling points of the show is examining how our body works with an innovative way of storytelling. Every action has a consequence and it\u2019s easy to see why. The first few episodes shows this when a group of Pneumococus bacteria attacks a red blood cell before being recused by a white blood cell. The traditional concepts of the show is how characters deal with their problems like the way our human body does. As I mentioned before, our body is very vulnerable and is exposed every day. Even a simple wound opens opportunities for catastrophe if the body isn\u2019t prepared enough. This almost happens in some of the earlier episodes. Other times, the body may not be ready in the first place such as against cases of allergies, heat waves, or food poisoning. When it comes down to it, I think the creator really looked at exploring our bodies\u2019 problems in many ways.\\n\\n\r\nWhen the show deploys its character cast well, it\u2019s definitely hard to take eyes off of them. From the variety of cells to the foreign pathogens, there\u2019s colorful cinematography. It would be nice to live in a world where our body is perfect but accidents happen. When they do, your body has to fend them off or there could be disastrous consequences. This is where our cells comes in to take care of the problems and the action in this show wastes no time to showcase that. It\u2019s thrown with an innovative style such as the White Blood Cells brutalizing pathogens or Macrophages showcasing their terrifying skills. Even the cute little platelets in this series has their own duties by reconstructing our body. Many other T-Cells (Helper, Regulatory, Effector) perform their own duties to make sure our body is healthy. I\u2019m not going to lie though, watching this series reminds me to take care good of our own bodies. Realistically, more people die by diseases than any other causes in the world. You can blame that on heart disease, cancer, strokes, infections, etc. The big picture here is that the show also feels very real when we see what our body can do.\\n\\n\r\nCreative ideas take a creative mind. And I say this with the belief that we definitely needed a talented staff and studio to make this show believable. Thankfully, director Kenichi Suzuki applied his craft that made the show as stylish as it can be. His previous work with Jojo: Stardust Creators and Drifters can occasionally be noticeable with the amount of bizarreness going on. There\u2019s personality injected into the various characters while cinematography is beautifully crafted. There\u2019s also respect to be given to talented voice cast too especially for taking on the roles of these characters. Everyone in the show felt meaningful and there\u2019s not one moment that should be discarded as meaningless. Similarly, the theme songs has a playful energy and atmosphere that never leaves the show.\\n\\n\r\nI won\u2019t say this anime is easy to watch from first glance. It\u2019s about the human body and in my many years of watching anime, there\u2019s very few that took on this concept. (the closest one that came to mind is Moyashimon) As such, Hataraku Saibou is quite unique with how it manages its ideas, selling its craft, and making it into a reality.",

            "content": "This series was one of the most unique ones that most have been anticipating since the start of the year, and when it arrived in the lackluster Summer season, aside from the certainty that does not disappoint, it is entertaining to the mildest degree, while having a lot of *pokes* at the function of the most important system: us human beings.\r\nNow, I don't care that whether you have studied subjects that are close to this, but I'm fairly certain that no matter our background as people whom have learned about cells in one way or another, Hataraku Saibou, or Cells at Work!, will definitely pleaseyour senses that you are learning about yourself, and the cells that work hard to be able to sustain you in the long run and grow stronger. With that said, everyone, be it otaku or non-otaku, have at least witnessed this anime, and it really broke the conventional walls that this is something that speaks to everyone, as it did magnificently.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is as clear-cut as it gets: Everything that you see within a microscope, are your daily drivers, the cells at work where every funcion is as important as the other. Now, I get it, it's a series that's worth the educational take, but thankfully it's not like a heavy plot pointer of info-dumped force-wrecker, and at least just demonstrates just about right and doesn't force it on us, which is a good thing. And as usual, the Black Clover aesthetics come back with the usual body-explaining capped-repeat to make sure that you understand what is going with your own body, and then addresses the episodic issue at hand. Honestly though? This is about as entertaining as it gets for anime to get very personal with its viewers, and it succeeds well in that regard.\\n\\n\r\nThe host of characters, oh sorry I mean cells, are the strongest suit of the series. As with portraying the exact minute details of the cells right down to the extreme, I'd say this is a faithful adaptation of the human body. I mean sure, we all know what the Red (Erythrocyte) and White (Neutrophil) blood cells (voiced by the wonderful Kana Hanazawa and Tomoaki Maeno) do and their properties that keep our body safe from harm, but have we ever wondered: \"What about the other cells, like the silent killers Macrophage, the disease-preventing killer and helper T cells, the body reconstructing Platelets (ravioli, ravoli, don't lewd loli platelets!), the weak-willed but strong Eosinophil, to name a few?\" The monster designs were weird as hell, especially for the viruses like the mucus-grotesque cedar pollen ones that are easy to kill to the major ones that could cause a disease that could cause serious consequences like heat stroke, hemorrhagic shock and food poisoning. Overall, props to character designer Takahiko Yoshida for his pretty work here.\\n\\n\r\nDavid Production, the same studio behind Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, was a surprise pick for a studio to work on because their work of repertiore really varies from strength to strength, and adding to this, Hataraku Saibou becomes a fan favourite due to their quality of work done here. For example, the \"sneeze\" segment (that was meant to feel like an explosion) right at Episode 1 was hilarious and insanely funny, and right after that in Episode 2 we're introduced to the children-like loli platelets (which has become a favourite meme and the pivotal point of the \"pressing the loli cheek\" smiles), not to mention that to put the icing on the cake, the killer T cells in Episode 3 are the perfect reference to Jojo with the bastardized character figure and the single ponytail hair, that was anything but a fine reference. And in order to make our cells feel like they're at \"real\" work, the action scenes around the white blood cells in all types against the numerous viruses with the bloody scenes and over-the-top action. The reason for the drop in score is because some episodes had a minor drop in quality (but not by much), but it is still a visual treat nonetheless. With careful planning and perfect replication, this is a good series to boot its animation quality.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is one where it might get on your nerves, but for what it is, I liked it a hell lot. The OP which is just a collaboration work between the character VAs for Red and White Blood, Killer T and Macrophage really sounded like the mission to keep the human body working, is mundane but the essence is what gives it a home-run strike. There was one episode where the OP was replaced with Killer T and Macrophage VAs, and people are wondering what was that, and that's just the 2nd cour of the song, which still is good to boot. And oh good god the ED, ClariS nails it once again (as is with every song that they made) with the happy visuals and tones. The background scenes were just as adequate to provide much needed movement for the overall setting, and it's A-OK!\\n\\n\r\nIf there was that one definite show that will stand the test of time, it will be this one, much lauded for its \"breaking the fourth wall\" attention that aside from many casual anime watchers, EVEN the workers of true professions (doctors etc.) find that this anime is really a testament to how much knowledge it is given and took all of that into great consideration to keep it as linear as real life as possible. For the Summer 2018 season alone, this one could be many people's AOTS material and for excellent reasons. if you were skeptical of how the anime medium takes cells into consideration, I highly, HIGHLY plea you to watch this anime, it's definitely very responsive, reliant and relatable to all of us as imperfect human beings. Now, if you excuse me, I'm gonna take notes and learn as much as I can to regulate my body for the better!\\n\\n\r\n...Or is it, waiting until the spin-off, Cells at Work! BLACK to be made???",

            "content": "The Summer season of 2018 seemed to rely heavily on original adaptations when compared to the previous seasons of the same year, especially Spring, when more than half of the top ten most popular anime on this site were sequels. Various well-received returning and continuing anime fought for the position of best show of the cour, all of them with very high ratings; but new releases also held up competently, bringing both classic manga and recent visual and light novels to the screen, along with its fair share of originals.

Brought to life by David Production, the show also acted as a testament of the staying power of the relatively new studio as one of the most relevant producers in activity today.\\n\\n\r\nIn a year that kicked off with the lovely Earth-chan springing up everywhere and followed on with other original creations like Tidepod-chan and Explorer-chan, it was guaranteed that the next anime with characters based on inanimate objects would generate a large amount of buzz. And with the premise of showing us a fantastical interpretation of the adventures of the cells in our bodies, Hataraku Saibou drew in countless viewers and absolutely left its mark on the community. As a Pharmacy student, I waited eagerly for this show to start ever since it was announced, and the final result was still way beyond my expectations.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 7\\n\r\nSome people describe Hataraku Saibou as an educational anime, a label with which I disagree. Its purpose is pure, unadulterated entertainment, only using scientific concepts as a background, quite like how the Fate franchise handles History in its unique way. Hataraku Saibou avoids simply relying on its gimmick. Its structure is similar to many popular anime, particularly from the shonen genre/demographic, and incorporates exciting action scenes, short but well-crafted character arcs and frenzied twists in the latter parts of each episode. The first episode is a excellent summary of the basic formula and will most certainly captivate everyone who's open to the experience within its 24 minutes. Personal opinion incoming: anyone who didn't enjoy the conclusion of that first episode, where after a long chase, a lone germ is contained and put inside a missile named \"Sneeze\" which is then launched and detonated as cells all around rejoice and salute may be just too cynical to enjoy any work that's more light-hearted than Berserk.\\n\\n\r\nLatter episodes up the game by incorporating more intricate concepts that interpolate artistic vision and scientific knowledge, such as Memory Cells being portrayed as conspiracy theorists who warn other cells against an improbable catastrophe - just the way we know how allergy works - taking that chance to present conflicts among the characters. Drugs are represented as robots whose actions expire after a certain time and are seen as a total mystery by the human-styled cells. There are also episodes that provide backstory to some of the main characters and a moving redemption arc for a major villain later on.\\n\\n\r\nART: 7\\n\r\nOverall, the art style is nice and the animation is decent, though there is some variation in quality at times. The recycling of sequences and some visible bail-outs in regards to animation were noticeable in the TV broadcast, though DP is already known for its drastic retouches in its blu-ray releases. The overtly detailed and vibrant backgrounds may just be the greatest part of the art direction. Location design gets increasingly captivating with every new episode and we also have a major change in ambience in a final, more serious arc. The visual gags, one of the most universal aspects of Japanese comedy, are also very solid. Fights are extremely over-the-top, with blood flying everywhere and staining the white bodies of the Neutrophils, something which decidedly requires some effort to animate. The carefulness of the work is even surprising, knowing that at that moment, David Production was also busy with the year-long series Captain Tsubasa '18 and the much expected new season of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 10\\n\r\nAaaand here we have the strongest suit of Hataraku Saibou. The character design is simply one the best and most charismatically handled in recent memory, with the likeness of the main characters featuring heavily in fanart sites and in social networks. Even without any given names or complex backstories for many of them, we see an incredible, unique method characterization whose charm lies in its simplicity and faithfulness to the original concept - the human body itself. Knowing the biological properties of the cells beforehand, one can already expect some of the characters to have some specific traits, such as the Macrophage being an insanely powerful fighter. The Basophils and T-cells were also other personal favorites of mine. The monster design is spectacularly creative and all of the locations, as I implied before when praising the backgrounds, are evocative and very well-constructed. Trust me, you'll find yourself eagerly waiting to see how the next group of cells or organs look like.\\n\\n\r\nAnd of course, there's still the moe side of it all. The Platelets, for one, were an instant hit with the anime community and it's very easy to see why. The show goes all out on wives, too; fan favorites include Macrophage, NK Cell and Eosinophil. Fan theories, like the main character being a defective sickle cell, also run wild, showing the strong engagement that's already formed between these amazing characters and the fandom.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 7\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is fairly competent, with tense tracks playing during the fights and crises faced by the characters, triumphant fanfares at arc conclusions and comfy mood music during the Slice of Life sections. The opening theme is a fun collaboration among the voice actors; the ED is more on the generic side, but that is already decent enough for ClariS. Nevertheless, who steals the scene in the sound department are the CVs themselves, an all-star cast of seiyuu such as Kana Hanazawa, Daisuke Ono, Tomokazu Sugita, and a personal favorite as the narrator: Mamiko Noto. The snippets with them exclaiming the show's title between breaks will put a smile on your face.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 10\\n\r\nYour mileage may vary on this one. Over the past few years I've been studying Histology, Immunology, Hematology and Microbiology, among many other subjects, and all of them converge into the deliciously entertaining mix that is Hataraku Saibou, covering my overlapping interests in both Biology and anime.\\n\r\nYet, in my opinion, the final result is so ridiculously appealing that being overtly familiar with the subject matter is not a prerequisite to fully enjoy the series. One might even learn a thing or two here, or just sit back and enjoy the ride.\\n\\n\r\nHataraku Saibou is definitely worth the try as one of the most relevant anime from its season and hopefully, it will stand the test of time, bringing along the adaptations of the manga's next chapters and of its spin-offs.",

After the initial shock you quickly realize that despite its originality this anime is incredibly generic (does that make sense? i dunno but thats how i felt while watching this).\r\nStory: There is no story, this is kind of a simpsons slice of life where at the end of the day everything isfine and dandy. Episode 12 and 13 were the most entertaining of all of them because the story felt real even if just a little. Sadly i personally felt that the ep 13 was the worst animated of all them so it took a little bit of the magic of the finale to this anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt: It's David Production. It's good.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The VA's were perfect and both the opening and the ending are incredibly catchy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Probably the lowest point of the anime and the most cringy side of the anime fanbase stems from this part. \\n\r\nAside from probably the MC the rest of the characters hold no value.\\n\r\nYeah yeah platelet is cute but its a one trick pony that on my opinion exhausts its charm fairly quickly.\\n\r\nWhite Blood Cell is interesting but we never get to know him at all so he ends up at being plain and it feels like he is just a secondary character that its there. \\n\r\nIn the last episode we barely see him a few seconds until the finale.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: If you like gag mangas where nothing really matters then you might enjoy Hataraku Saibou.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: The show lacks value and intensity.  If i were to be a weeb i still wouldnt like it because there is no waifu material fight me.\\n\r\n If i were to treat Hataraku Saibou as a normal anime i wouldnt give it more than a 6.",

            "content": "This is one of the laziest shows I've ever seen.\r\nLazy characters. The main characters are each one of the cells of your immune system: red blood cell, white blood cell, etc. There is little reason to care about any of them, because they act similarly to their comrades and lack any defining traits that separates them from the trillions of cells like them. And any minuscule defining traits these characters show are being incompetent at their jobs or having backstories that don't matter in the slightest in regards to their development.\r\nLazy setting. Before we stray too far away from the topic of how many cellsthere are, this show does an abysmal job at representing how many cells actually exist in this world, and when being a cell of a body entitles you to have a human, sentient form or not. If blood cells can have human forms then why not every other freaking cell that exists in your body? Why can't parietal cells, ones that secrete stomach juices, be characters, huh? Why can't Melanocytes make a cameo alongside the loli platelets? Why do nutrients look like human food? This sounds like I'm picking apart something that's meant to be a quirky world that doesn't need to make sense, but it just looks and sounds so superficial and stupid. Especially when you consider...\\n\\n\r\nLazy story. Generic germs fight, anime explains what these germs do, generic cells fight back, anime explains what cells do. It honestly feels like you're watching a boring animated biology lecture for your school project. And even if you wanted to learn, it confuses you with these uncreative representations of how things look and work that you'll end up not learning anything.\\n\\n\r\nLazy execution. There are no stakes. Our main character cells don't die during times they should have. Are you seriously trying to tell me a premature red cell can fare against a big germ in a direct confrontation? Or that a hit from one of the deadliest afflictions of the human body against one white cell doesn't kill it? NO. And this is a problem because the show themes these events as suspenseful and tense, not to mention it fluctuates between comedy and drama in such a disingenuous way, always making comedic light or emotional moments of events that don't call for it.\\n\\n\r\nLazy comedy and drama. The drama derives of the cells not thinking they're good enough, then they become good enough, in the same episode. The comedy derives from characters' overreactions, characters which we discussed are boring and generic as they come.\\n\\n\r\nJust a lazy, lazy show.\\n\\n\r\nArt is good, stiff at times but still pretty decent. Nothing noteworthy of the soundtrack, OP and ED kinda suck but eh that's subjective. The design of the white blood cells is honestly great. It's just that I cannot fathom how it was thematically correct to have white blood cells have such unique designs, and yet have every other cell be a human in a uniform. WHY?!?\\n\\n\r\nThe only reason I stuck around for so long was to see how they tackle the most interesting and deadly disease, you know the one. And it lasts one and a half episodes. No one dies except an unimportant crowd of cells that have the word \"Cell\" written on their white t-shirts. Lazy.\\n\\n\r\nI'm so done. I don't get why people find this show funny, creative or emotionally investing in any regard.",

The mere gimmick itself got me to episode 4, but the show's writing wouldn't find itself out of place in a stereotypical 5/10 shounen show. It becomes so cliche at point that I found myself cringing a bit, especially in this fourth episode. The show does a lot of fun things with it's setting butit never uses it for interesting story telling. The characters are a bit flat and 2dimensional (ha ha) and are about as developed as a loaf of bread.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is alright, it wouldn't find itself out of place among the ranks the average seasonal anime show, but nothing more than that. There was even an example of a clip of animation being used four times in the fourth episode, which just seems incredibly cheap to me. The shots are never impressive and the scenes are never noteworthy. It just seems like a the camera was plopped onto the scene, but never in any interesting ways, which isn't atypical to your standard anime but is definitely a point against it. \\n\\n\r\nIf you think that this gimmick alone is enough to stomach mediocre writing, okay to bad animation, decent sound, and flat characters then you should give it a watch. It's still enjoyable regardless and if you think you'll like it based on the concept you will probably like it.",

            "content": "Who would\u2019ve thought that such a series existed that had an imaginative way to learn about how the body's blood system works. I haven\u2019t come across anything like it in my time as an avid fan of anime so from that alone you can\u2019t help but be intriguingly interested. Hataraku Saibou (Cells at Work!) is a unique and terrifyingly accurate depiction on what actually happens during your body's never-ending fight against outside antigens, diseases and injuries. Whilst a semi-educational anime on human biology, rather than being boring, this anime is full of life and it includes elements of both shounen action and great comedy, allowingits audience to enjoy themselves while learning about how things function within the human body. From the smallest scrape to the most vicious bout of the common flu, everything that affects your system on the inside affects the day-to-day life of the trillions of cells keeping your body running smoothly. We then get to see how the body reacts to these injuries and bacteria and how the cells work together to combat or fix the issues at hand. \\n\\n\r\nLiterally, the story is in the title but these body cells of ours take humanoid form and are in this fantastical real-world-like city that is our body, which is constantly invaded by foreign agents. All the cells resemble people but the infections, bacteria, germs, viruses all look like monsters\u2014e.g. an influenza virus turns cells into zombies etc. Not sure what their jobs are? No worries, Cells at Work! explains it to you in the most digestible way. We follow the adventures of a Red Blood Cell, AE3803, who is our cheerful and spunky heroine who is unfamiliar with the blood vessels, causing her to get lost often while delivering goods. Her main task is to deliver oxygen, carbon dioxide and nutrients all over the body like the rest of her kind. There are lots of potential dangers along the way given the main narrative but the White Blood Cells are here to protect everyone. One recurring character, for example, our hero the White Blood Cell (Neutrophil) U-1146, who is part of the force that acts as the body\u2019s initial defence against foreign invaders and infectious diseases. He\u2019s depicted as a savagely violent man who is also polite. When the bad bacteria advances on our heroine, the White Blood Cell appears and attacks it until its eliminated. When this occurs, they are great action sequences and bloody violent but when you think about it, what the human body does to protect itself is quite violent to those invaders.\\n\\n\r\nFor being an anime about the human body, Cells at Work! is surprisingly accurate. Even little things are thought about, including the way that the Red Blood Cells have reversible jackets for when they are carrying oxygen versus when they are carrying carbon dioxide. Or scenes where White Blood Cells break through the ceiling, exclaiming that they can pass between veins. It is clear that extensive research was done before the careful planning of this series. There is plenty of adventures and even a potential love interest between our hard-working Red Blood Cell protagonist and the mysterious but powerful White Blood Cell agent who protects her. There is a real chemistry with those two and their history goes way back to events prior to the main story, there is an alluring charm to their relationship that makes you want more of it. There are other recurring characters like the buff Killer-T Cell, the strong NK Cell, the Macrophage, Fat Cell, Helper T Cell, the adorable Platelets and many more. They appear in a monster/catastrophe-of-the-week type of format and get to see their specific roles and how they protect the body from such things.\\n\\n\r\nDavid Production is the studio behind the revamped JoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure series and their works with it some of the best in the industry, but you can kind of see that their busy schedule with other projects started to show in the animation here for some parts\u2014maybe not enough time but there were serval times where the quality drops and you can see some short-cuts like recycling a lot of sequences\u2014e.g, like Platelets directing traffic. But either than that it\u2019s still pretty good and I like how the animation goes wild in the action sequences and how blood sprays all over the White Blood Cells (Neutrophils) when they eliminate the monsters, they become drenched in it, it\u2019s a nice touch because they are literally white (even their clothes) and visually it looks cool. Character designs are really great a lot are so distinctive like how the Neutrophils are all plain white, Platelets look like children and Killer-T Cells are built like soldiers. The backgrounds get progressively detailed and introduce a new facet of the world with each passing episode as it goes through different sections of the body and the architecture designs along with the colour palette are beautiful. Most of this is credited to the mangaka in Akane Shimizu. \\n\\n\r\nThe Opening to this anime really outshines the Ending, it really is catchy and you can\u2019t help me in a good mood and even sing along as embarrassing as that may sound, but its true! \u201cMission! Ken Kou Dai Ichi\u201d is actually done by the some of the voice acting team, our heroine (Kana Hanazawa), U-1146 (Tomoaki Maeno), Killer T Cell (Daisuke Ono) and Macrophage (Kikuko Inoue). Its upbeat, cheery and has a lot of energy. And speaking of the Seiyuu, they all had strong performances especially our heroine who is the heart and soul of the series. I think the choice for the narrator was spot on given the educational aspect, like a Siri type of tone and it makes sense since the narration is info dumping the details of the human body. With so much information coming at you, the added wording on the screen can be a bit much at times. The included text is usually helpful, providing context for characters and narration on how the body is dealing with specific changes. It gives just enough information to be informative but admittedly it can be slightly burdensome to read them. \\n\\n\r\nCells at Work! is clearly an anime you can\u2019t watch without thinking given how informative and accurate it is. Even the humour often stems from interactions between the characters and their various roles within the body which mean you can only truly enjoy this series if you are able to understand what\u2019s actually going on. As entertainment, the fights between all the different germs, bacteria, viruses and the body's systems keep viewers interested. But the real value here is the creativity in explaining the human body and how it works. This is genius work here, who would have thought that the tropes of shounen action and comedy and a tour of anthropomorphising the human body's circulatory system would mesh so well? That\u2019s the brilliance of Akane Shimizu. I wish for this anime to be used to help students understand and remember the biology information they have learned in school, in a much more entertaining way.\\n",

            "content": "This is my first review so it's probably not going to be that good, but I'll try.\r\nFirst off I'd like to say that I've always had a love for media that takes a concept and personifies it, and I also have a fascination for biology, so this anime was already perfect for me. The comedy is hilarious and I found myself laughing a lot of times, which I don't tend to do with most comedies.\r\nStory: 9\r\nThere isn't much of a standard story, of course, the basic is that we follow the cells in our body, working in their special fields, in a city-like setting.\r\nBut theseries is episodic, where we get to learn more about a different cell each episode. We even get to learn about the viruses and bacterias! I like that a lot, it's very enjoyable and educational! But with each episode having different focus points and plot, there will probably be episodes I love and some I didn't enjoy as much, so far I like them all tho!\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThe art isn't outstanding, but I do find that the design of the characters and the setting in which they live is very creative and nice! I like that the organs and functions of the body is represented as little people or as buildings and structures! And the animation is perfectly fine too! As an animator myself I could not do any better lol!\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nGot to be honest, I'm not good with reviewing sound at all, but for me, it was quite nice to listen to! I found the soundeffects to be appropriate and the voice actors are awesome! Also, the theme song is catchy and cute.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\r\nThis is the best part of the series, the main cast is lovable, and they are simplistic, they have one purpose and they stick to that purpose, none of them really have any sad, depressing backstory or anything, they are straight to the point, lovable and funny! I love them all, especially best girl Macrophage.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime so much! It had me laughing so many times, I would rewind scenes that would make me laugh the hardest, and learning about all the cells and viruses in the middle of the plot was lovely, and I love the narrators voice very much!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nSo far this is the best anime I've watched in 2018, but I don't watch everything seasonal so I can't say if there's anything that's possibly better than this, but from everything I've seen, this is my favorite, and I am excited to watch more episodes.\\n\\n\r\nWe are Cells at Work!",

            "content": "Hataraku Saibou might be one of if not the best educational anime out there. While feeding you information on a pretty wide variety of biology and anatomy related topic it managed to mix it with a healthy dose of comedy, action and drama without feeling any of those feeling tacked on.\r\nThe show revolves around a human body being represented as one huge city, inside which the human looking cells diligently go about doing their jobs the keep everything in good condition. Just from this it should be clear that there\u2019s plenty of artistic license taken when it comes to depicting a human body and everythingwithin in but the show remains surprisingly faithful the topic and doesn\u2019t mislead the viewer or try to distort facts enough to make a narrative out of it. \\n\r\nIf have a google search license you can try and find a bunch of threads where an actual doctor breaks down what happens in the episodes in detail to see the full extent of it. Even something that might seem unrelated to biology or unrealistic might turn out to be rooted deep in reality. The show won\u2019t go on explaining you a lot of this stuff cause a lot of it is fairly advanced but it\u2019s nice to know that author has a good understanding of what he\u2019s working with and dedicated to implementing into the world and story. Maybe people with more specialized knowledge will be able to get a lot more enjoyment out of this show than the average viewer.\\n\\n\r\nNot that you need to know anything at all to enjoy this show. The main narrative is usually centered around things that a easier to explain like how blood circulates, what body does to combat various types of bacteria and viruses, how allergy or heat stroke affect your body, what happens when you get a wound, etc. On top of that we\u2019re usually seeing this all from the perspective of our clueless protagonist,AE-3803, a clumsy red blood cell who just recently started her duty of delivering oxygen and nutrients to other cells. \\n\\n\r\nWith this premise show manages to effortlessly go between comedy, drama and action incredibly smoothly. First of all there a lot of SoL and humorous bits that usually revolve around how characters interact with each other or their environment which all feel fresh even if you\u2019ve seen similar gags before simply because of the premise. There\u2019s not that many comedic anime I can really connect to but this one managed to get a solid laugh out of me almost every episode. It helps a lot that this time around pretty much every joke is based on something every living human can probably relate to. \\n\\n\r\nEach episode also usually has some form of treat present in one way or another. For example aforementioned wound is a disaster for cells in and of itself but a wound also means that it\u2019s easier for germs and bacteria to get in and try to start mess inside your body. When it\u2019s nothing serious the show will stick to just starting a hilarious bloodbath with battle crazy neutrophils but surprisingly enough there\u2019s more nuance to be had here. \\n\\n\r\nWhile it\u2019s obviously a step away from the more scientific elements of the show, at times we get to see how cells feel about what\u2019s happening in your body and about their dangerous but important duty to keep the host safe and working. It might not teach you anything new but I\u2019d bet a lot of people leave this show wanting to take better care of their body after seeing a dramatic depiction of what we consider completely trivial. Things like cells inside your body being created and taught how to do their job or how much of a threat it can be to get a cold or go on without proper nutrition. Part of makes this seemingly nonsensical dramatic part work is that it doesn\u2019t quite linger on anything to act like you should be on the edge of your seat, waiting to see if the body will manage to overcome the problem that you likely faced yourself many times but instead smoothly transitions into solution and a sweet and cheerful conclusion of everything being put into order and cells celebrating another victory for them and the body they live in. Show\u2019s finale was extremely satisfying because it took everything I mentioned before and put them in a tight package during the final episodes that took the show to a new high on almost every level except for visual.\\n\\n\r\nProbably most unfortunate part of HS is that while it\u2019s an very entertaining and wholesome show, I feel like its strength most of the time come from the manga and anime doesn\u2019t quite offer that much compared to it. Sure, having everything voiced is nice but the visual department is lacking a lot. There are many places where instead of proper animation we get to see a shaky screen or a camera pan over a still frame or short animation loop, which is shame cause when action in HS can look pretty cool when depicted well. A lot of the shots feel like an uninspired panel to panel adaptation which almost never looks good when brought over to a different medium. Color palette is pleasing enough to the eyes during brighter sections of the show but when it shifts to darker colors it starts to look very dull when uninteresting shots are couples with poor color composition, last two episodes are one of the few exceptions where they show that those sections could\u2019ve looked much better. This is once again the biggest downfall of the show to me cause it constantly affect the quality of scenes that could\u2019ve had much more impact.\\n\\n\r\nMusic is a bit of a mixed bag too but it leans towards a better side. While there\u2019s plenty of fairly generic tracks that do their bare minimum to enhance the scene, the battle tracks are pretty damn good across the board. They do a great job of adding to the scale and threat when a disaster occurs. Either way the characters are talking so often that music is rarely allowed to take over, at times even being mixed so low that you can barely notice it\u2019s there at all.\\n\\n\r\nWhile not at all flawless, Hataraku Saibou is still a great package overall that I can recommend to pretty much everyone. It\u2019s relatively unique in its premise and execution. It will probably teach you something new about your body and possibly make you appreciate it just a bit more.",

Indeed,the two main characters ,red/white blood cell,impressed you a lot,but the supporting characters are also memorable .I have a hunch that I would hardly forget the adorable platelets,the serene but also aggressive maids macrophages,the eerie ninja basophil ,the virile and muscular T-cells ,the miserable and doomed cancer cells,and so on.Each of them is so individual and subtly created in reference with their practical functions in real life.To be frank,David Production ,as well as the writer Shimizu has the techniques in making you infatuated with the characters created and immersive in that fantastic world setting.\\n\r\nHowever,it is a bit ironic that your cells are living in such a society\uff0cwhich you might call Utopia or authentic Communism without exploitation and sordid currency circulation system\uff08well\uff0cregardless of the fact that they don\u2019t have an option to select their occupations \uff09,whereas you are being compelled to struggle hard ,work like a dog,and watch Hataraku Saibou at the same time as eating instant noodle to appease your hunger. From this perspective,we might find more resonances from the manga Hataraku Saibou Black rather than this TV series(lol).\\n\r\nNevertheless,don\u2019t be crestfallen by comparison,see,they are always bouncy rather than being jaded,protecting you and fighting for you relentlessly without a pause.Consequently\uff0cshall we give them some positive responses ? :\uff09\\n\r\nIn a word,I hope you enjoy the show !",

            "content": "While there is no denying that Hataraku Saibou is unique and innovative, people seem to believe this, by itself, makes it a great anime. It does not.\r\nDon't get me wrong, I enjoyed this anime, and thought it would be a great idea to teach kids about biology, but the anime itself is lackluster.\r\nStory: 4/10\r\nA slice of life anime that follows the daily activities of a red and white blood cell. We get to see in detail how the body reacts to different problems and learn more about how the body works. HS gets points for accurate biology and for a novel idea, but unlike yourtypical SOL anime, It's impossible to relate to the characters, because A) They're blood cells. And B) They're tropes, exaggerated with the intent to amuse kids. Also, since episodes are designed to be stand alone, it defeats the purpose of a SOL anime.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition to this, because the story is sub-par and to make sure they appeal to kids, they also made it a shounen battle anime. Where nobody important ever dies, the good guys always win, and it's the weak character we were just introduced to who doubts themselves only to be the hero and defeat the bad guy at the end. But it's also a Shounen battle anime, where we don't really care about any of the characters, and villains are introduced and defeated in single episodes which is very tedious.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\r\nNothing mind blowing or innovative, but it's still good quality, and pleasing to look at. Excpet the fight scenes. Boy are they lacking in excitement.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nMeh. Nothing bad. Just nothing memorable, or catchy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 4/10\\n\r\nOh boy. I mean, I know they're cells. One of trillions of virtually identical cells, but that's still not a good reason to make them all the same. You could literally swap out the main characters in HS, for another of the same cell, and the series would be exactly the same. All characters are tropes, and no attempt is made at development, aside from hints at some kind of attraction between Red and White.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the first 2-3 episodes. It was very educational, and biologically correct, which I really enjoyed, but then I realized that a novel idea and biological accuracy were the only things this show had going for it. I think the entire anime maybe got a handful of chuckles out of me, which as a gag anime, is quite pathetic. It became a chore to watch the following episodes, hoping against hope that maybe the show might develop into something good. (It doesn't). \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe gimmick of following the Cells in your body is interesting, but not enough to put up with such a boring story, bad writing, and 2D generic trope characters who you don't care about. If anyone remembers the show Ozzy and Drix, it was a similar idea, but one much better executed (albeit with worse art).\\n\\n\r\nIf I ever have kids, I might watch it again for educational reasons, but aside from that, I never want to see this show again.\\n",

            "content": "Cells At Work is an educational series about how the human body functions on cellular level. Its source material was originally released in the Japanese science magazine called Gross Biological Stuff and Geeky Nerdy Shit Weekly, now made into an anime format to ensure the misinformation of this shonen comedy reaches a wider audience. \r\nI refuse to use the reddit meme phrase \"\"as a\" biology major\" to back up my rhetoric with titles -- moreover, majoring biology requires bit more than reading 3 wikipedia articles about cells -- so instead I will say this series has a pretty interesting take on something that could becalled pseudo-science. I am still deeply disappointed that this wasn't like 'Moyashimon' -- the most accurate series about agriculture ever created, or like 'Once Upon a Time...Life' -- the French animation franchise produced in the 70's and 80's, \"Life\" being only one of the many parts of it. Instead, we have a comedy series that can be enjoyed the best by completely excluding its settings. However, I like comedy as well... unfortunately, that's where this show really flops. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening song (lyrics and opening animation) alone are the perfect alarm to everyone who expected this to meet the shonen demographics as this is the most childish shit opening I recall ever seeing. Turns out the series is not much better. \\n\\n\r\nOur story centers around this female red blood cell who never finds her way to where she is supposed to go because she is dumb, and this white blood cell dude who is always at the right place at the right time like the hero he is. Reddo girl runs from place to another and discovers bacteria and whatever nasty shit, followed by mr. white rekking them like he is Saitama from One Punch Man. That's pretty much the entirety of the series as it is nothing but below average fighting tournament shonen disrespecting its settings with references that only appear smart to people who aren't -- and centering around 2 extremely uninteresting characters. None of this would be a problem if the series was clearly aimed for children, but unfortunately all of this is just childish: great many children shows are more mature than this, moreover, children series tend to have charm which this one is missing completely. \\n\\n\r\nI am personally huge fan of Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, but after constantly witnessing barely mediocre series from David Production, I am starting to think they will be one franchise miracle and not much more. Cells at Work's biggest achievement is strengthening this thought. This is the seasonal anime series that I really wanted to like. Unfortunately that has proven to be hard because it sucks. I can recommend seasonal anime watchers to watch the first episode and decide after that if this is worth of it or not, but personally, I say it's not worth much. \\n\\n\r\n*edit, changed one word to less offensive form",

            "content": "\"The human body is the best work of art.\" - Jess C. Scott\r\nScience is the study of everything around us. From the early stages of our universe, to the ancient civilizations in the past that leads us to our modern and technological society. Then we come to society. What makes a society even? The people. Humanity have transcended and evolved for generations and generations and will continue evolving like an endless cycle of life.\r\nWhat does a human compose of? Cells, organs, organ system, tissues, atoms, molecules, ions and so on and so forth. This things, particularly the cells, are the ones that keeps on givinghumanity life as we know it. From RBCs transporting oxygen throughout the body, to the WBCs fighting and defending our body against foreign invaders. Truly, the human body is indeed the best work of art. And then an anime based on this heroic beings finally aired this Summer 2018 as being one of the unique anime this season.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThis anime \"Cells At Work.\" doesn't have a chronological order in terms of the plot because, as we know it, the story of it is about the cells of our body. What they do against diseases, injuries and other life-threatening phenomenons that can happen to our body. Each character or cells of the story contributes on every episode because of their functionality. For example, the Blood Circulation episode which is of course mainly for Red Blood Cell, while the Thymocytes episode is about the childhood life of Killer, Regular, and Helper T Cell. We get to know on each episode how artistic, beautiful and smart the author of Cells At Work manga (which the anime based on) in plotting out different things about the cells different capabilities based on their real life counterpart. It is honestly very hard to make a manga or anime out of this characters as cells on our body are really hard to describe on, draw to different anime characters and have traits on them contributing to a anime world full of cells. For example, White Blood Cell (Neutrophil) is killing those bacteria, viruses or any type of foreign invaders with a knife and sprayin them afterwards. That is one of the smart moves I've seen that the author applied to be on an anime character because if they base it on the real WBC then it will just look.... weird and hideous as the WBC on our body actually engulfs and then digests the invader with enzymes, powerful enough to kill it (Phagocytosis). Another example of how the anime presented White Blood Cells' migration process to being like them passing through pipes and killing the enemy. Another smart move of the author is the settings and environment of the story. I love how each place whether it is the heart, lungs, or even the stomach have details that we viewers can understand and is accurate to the real life progression of this organs. From the heart being like a temple/shrine depicting how holy or important it is to the normal places where cells are on their apartment buildings, its easy to say the artist of the anime or manga really work so hard on this anime. We also cannot forget how the anime have some comedic elements revolving the adventures of the Red Blood Cell. This element is not that important but if you look at it, it does as it makes the show more entertaining not overall being a show to present only what cells are doing. It also have dramatic elements from the fight scenes and especially the Cancer episode. Who would've thought some of us audience gets pity on cancer just because how dramatic the scene was. Another great factor of Cells At Work is that it is an educational anime where everyone can watch it even though you have a failing grade in Biology or you just hate it. It provides small and summarized text about a certain cell, method, disease and pathogens which makes it very informative not only fun to watch. Overall, the story's accuracy comparing it to the real life cells and systems are just a masterpiece to look at as well as its representation of the cells on their role on any biological terms (or the episodes).\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nIn terms of characters, we get to see alot of characters here since this is literally about your body which comprimises of trillions of cells. Its diversity of characters, fitting them all together with no one being as important as any one because of their functions makes the show a worth to watch if you're interest is Biology. We have the RBC's who carry oxygen through our body, WBC that defends us from pathogens as well as Macrophages, T-Cells, B-Cell and NK-Cell. (there are alot more so I ain't going to list those cells). Then the pathogens either a virus, bacteria or even cancer have roles to the story depending on the episode where they shine to be the antagonist threatening our human body. What I like about the characters is that even though they all have different purposes, on some instances everyone needs to be there, working out together to counter either a scrape wound, virus attack or cancer. I can say as well that we humans are the hidden characters as well on the story. Why? Because if you take a look at the episodes of Cells At Work, on some instances, our cells cannot do anything on their own. For example, the heat stroke episode, where every cell in the body are already dying of heat and just praying for the heavens to rain and then suddenly a big tube coming from the heavens showed up to provide a solution to our body (Transfusion). Hence, characters in Cells At Work is literally just your heroic cells but turn into a more artistic view on TV.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nSince the producer of this anime is David Production, which is the company that made Jojo's art phenomenal, I can see some instances that the art is reflected to Jojos'. For example is the faces of the Killer T-Cells and White Blood Cell, especially when Naive T-Cell turned into a bulky man. The visuals of the anime are really well-done and fits its theme. Who knew Platelets can be this cute?.. Aside from it being well-done, the art of the settings like I said earlier are a genius way to represent the human body systems in a manner that everyone can understand. Not like showing some microscopic things that we the audience that are not professionals on the field of Biology cannot understand at all. Its creativity on everything along with the character designs already a worth to watch anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI cannot stress out how much I love the Opening and Ending of this show. The opening is really catchy. Having lyrics about the cells on how they work and work and we see them doing their functions on the opening is a great way to start or introduce the characters. The ending song is probably my most favorite by ClaRiS so far. It is a song where you can sing along (well you can try even if you don't know japanese) and it makes you feel really joyful. It is also a song to take away your stress. No issues at all on the background music as they all fit the sequence.\\n\\n\r\nOverall thoughts and Enjoyment:\\n\r\nAs a student who loves studying Biology, I totally enjoyed this show. The fact that anime can transcend even into our bloodstream is just amazing when you look at it. I always have the moment of excitement when I watch this because I can relate some of what's happening because of Biology class. It is very creative, very well-done and a masterpiece. This shows that anime can literally make everything good. Overall, I really really love this show and it is such a fine work of art as well as a masterpiece. I recommend you to watch this if you like a summarize version of what's happening on our human body everyday.\\n",

            "content": "It\u2019s almost impossible to ignore biology when it comes to the human body. Hataraku Saibou (Cells at Work!) has the confidence to be its own series. It\u2019s like you take the cartoony Osmosis & Jones and turns it into an educational exploration. The human body is complex and that alone really made me wonder how this show could capture its magic.\r\nI\u2019d say making this show takes a creative mind and the audience should feel connected when watching this anime. Right from the start, the show reveals the human body and what it\u2019s made up of which is essentially red blood cells. It takes place inan anonymous person but one should presume that it\u2019s healthy until it faces conflicts inside. This is where the meat of the show really comes in. The human body is vulnerable and we face consequences every day in our lives.\\n\\n\r\nBut that\u2019s not really the problem, is it? The main course of the anime is composed of human body anatomy. Main characters are composed of Red Blood Cells, in particular one girl voiced by Kana Hanazawa. There\u2019s also a variety of others cells that includes white blood, Killer-T, Macrophage, Memory, and in general, the types that you\u2019d find in any human body. Let\u2019s face it, our human body is made up of trillion of cells. Every cell has its own role whether it\u2019s providing oxygen, getting rid of carbon dioxide, or muscle strengthening. Manga creator Akane Shimizu made this work through innovative thoughts of the actions going on in our bodies.\\n\\n\r\nWith 6+ volumes and counting, the show is only consists of 13 episodes. It became obvious that the story had to limit itself with exploring the full potential of what the human body can do. However, I will say right off the bat that this shouldn\u2019t be something to overlook. Because the more I watched this show, the more I realized how informative it can be. Surprisingly enough, the details of the human body is explored with an accurate representation. There\u2019s information that details with the context of the cells while also examining at the invaders that enters our body. This include germs, virus, and any foreign pathogen that threatens a person. From the first few episodes alone, we realize that our human body is very vulnerable if we don\u2019t take care of it. God gave us our bodies but didn\u2019t make us immortal. Hataraku Saibou definitely shows why.\\n\\n\r\nNaturally, anyone coming into this show should be wondering how the plot will be structured. While not following a direct linear plot, there\u2019s common recurring themes with pathogens invading the human body. The major selling points of the show is examining how our body works with an innovative way of storytelling. Every action has a consequence and it\u2019s easy to see why. The first few episodes shows this when a group of Pneumococus bacteria attacks a red blood cell before being recused by a white blood cell. The traditional concepts of the show is how characters deal with their problems like the way our human body does. As I mentioned before, our body is very vulnerable and is exposed every day. Even a simple wound opens opportunities for catastrophe if the body isn\u2019t prepared enough. This almost happens in some of the earlier episodes. Other times, the body may not be ready in the first place such as against cases of allergies, heat waves, or food poisoning. When it comes down to it, I think the creator really looked at exploring our bodies\u2019 problems in many ways.\\n\\n\r\nWhen the show deploys its character cast well, it\u2019s definitely hard to take eyes off of them. From the variety of cells to the foreign pathogens, there\u2019s colorful cinematography. It would be nice to live in a world where our body is perfect but accidents happen. When they do, your body has to fend them off or there could be disastrous consequences. This is where our cells comes in to take care of the problems and the action in this show wastes no time to showcase that. It\u2019s thrown with an innovative style such as the White Blood Cells brutalizing pathogens or Macrophages showcasing their terrifying skills. Even the cute little platelets in this series has their own duties by reconstructing our body. Many other T-Cells (Helper, Regulatory, Effector) perform their own duties to make sure our body is healthy. I\u2019m not going to lie though, watching this series reminds me to take care good of our own bodies. Realistically, more people die by diseases than any other causes in the world. You can blame that on heart disease, cancer, strokes, infections, etc. The big picture here is that the show also feels very real when we see what our body can do.\\n\\n\r\nCreative ideas take a creative mind. And I say this with the belief that we definitely needed a talented staff and studio to make this show believable. Thankfully, director Kenichi Suzuki applied his craft that made the show as stylish as it can be. His previous work with Jojo: Stardust Creators and Drifters can occasionally be noticeable with the amount of bizarreness going on. There\u2019s personality injected into the various characters while cinematography is beautifully crafted. There\u2019s also respect to be given to talented voice cast too especially for taking on the roles of these characters. Everyone in the show felt meaningful and there\u2019s not one moment that should be discarded as meaningless. Similarly, the theme songs has a playful energy and atmosphere that never leaves the show.\\n\\n\r\nI won\u2019t say this anime is easy to watch from first glance. It\u2019s about the human body and in my many years of watching anime, there\u2019s very few that took on this concept. (the closest one that came to mind is Moyashimon) As such, Hataraku Saibou is quite unique with how it manages its ideas, selling its craft, and making it into a reality.",

With that said, everyone, be it otaku or non-otaku, have at least witnessed this anime, and it really broke the conventional walls that this is something that speaks to everyone, as it did magnificently.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is as clear-cut as it gets: Everything that you see within a microscope, are your daily drivers, the cells at work where every funcion is as important as the other. Now, I get it, it's a series that's worth the educational take, but thankfully it's not like a heavy plot pointer of info-dumped force-wrecker, and at least just demonstrates just about right and doesn't force it on us, which is a good thing. And as usual, the Black Clover aesthetics come back with the usual body-explaining capped-repeat to make sure that you understand what is going with your own body, and then addresses the episodic issue at hand. Honestly though? This is about as entertaining as it gets for anime to get very personal with its viewers, and it succeeds well in that regard.\\n\\n\r\nThe host of characters, oh sorry I mean cells, are the strongest suit of the series. As with portraying the exact minute details of the cells right down to the extreme, I'd say this is a faithful adaptation of the human body. I mean sure, we all know what the Red (Erythrocyte) and White (Neutrophil) blood cells (voiced by the wonderful Kana Hanazawa and Tomoaki Maeno) do and their properties that keep our body safe from harm, but have we ever wondered: \"What about the other cells, like the silent killers Macrophage, the disease-preventing killer and helper T cells, the body reconstructing Platelets (ravioli, ravoli, don't lewd loli platelets!), the weak-willed but strong Eosinophil, to name a few?\" The monster designs were weird as hell, especially for the viruses like the mucus-grotesque cedar pollen ones that are easy to kill to the major ones that could cause a disease that could cause serious consequences like heat stroke, hemorrhagic shock and food poisoning. Overall, props to character designer Takahiko Yoshida for his pretty work here.\\n\\n\r\nDavid Production, the same studio behind Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, was a surprise pick for a studio to work on because their work of repertiore really varies from strength to strength, and adding to this, Hataraku Saibou becomes a fan favourite due to their quality of work done here. For example, the \"sneeze\" segment (that was meant to feel like an explosion) right at Episode 1 was hilarious and insanely funny, and right after that in Episode 2 we're introduced to the children-like loli platelets (which has become a favourite meme and the pivotal point of the \"pressing the loli cheek\" smiles), not to mention that to put the icing on the cake, the killer T cells in Episode 3 are the perfect reference to Jojo with the bastardized character figure and the single ponytail hair, that was anything but a fine reference. And in order to make our cells feel like they're at \"real\" work, the action scenes around the white blood cells in all types against the numerous viruses with the bloody scenes and over-the-top action. The reason for the drop in score is because some episodes had a minor drop in quality (but not by much), but it is still a visual treat nonetheless. With careful planning and perfect replication, this is a good series to boot its animation quality.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is one where it might get on your nerves, but for what it is, I liked it a hell lot. The OP which is just a collaboration work between the character VAs for Red and White Blood, Killer T and Macrophage really sounded like the mission to keep the human body working, is mundane but the essence is what gives it a home-run strike. There was one episode where the OP was replaced with Killer T and Macrophage VAs, and people are wondering what was that, and that's just the 2nd cour of the song, which still is good to boot. And oh good god the ED, ClariS nails it once again (as is with every song that they made) with the happy visuals and tones. The background scenes were just as adequate to provide much needed movement for the overall setting, and it's A-OK!\\n\\n\r\nIf there was that one definite show that will stand the test of time, it will be this one, much lauded for its \"breaking the fourth wall\" attention that aside from many casual anime watchers, EVEN the workers of true professions (doctors etc.) find that this anime is really a testament to how much knowledge it is given and took all of that into great consideration to keep it as linear as real life as possible. For the Summer 2018 season alone, this one could be many people's AOTS material and for excellent reasons. if you were skeptical of how the anime medium takes cells into consideration, I highly, HIGHLY plea you to watch this anime, it's definitely very responsive, reliant and relatable to all of us as imperfect human beings. Now, if you excuse me, I'm gonna take notes and learn as much as I can to regulate my body for the better!\\n\\n\r\n...Or is it, waiting until the spin-off, Cells at Work! BLACK to be made???",

            "content": "The Summer season of 2018 seemed to rely heavily on original adaptations when compared to the previous seasons of the same year, especially Spring, when more than half of the top ten most popular anime on this site were sequels. Various well-received returning and continuing anime fought for the position of best show of the cour, all of them with very high ratings; but new releases also held up competently, bringing both classic manga and recent visual and light novels to the screen, along with its fair share of originals. Among the new names of Summer 2018, Hataraku Saibou (Cells at Work!) deservedly warranted muchattention, establishing itself as one of the most hyped shows over the course of its successful run. Brought to life by David Production, the show also acted as a testament of the staying power of the relatively new studio as one of the most relevant producers in activity today.\\n\\n\r\nIn a year that kicked off with the lovely Earth-chan springing up everywhere and followed on with other original creations like Tidepod-chan and Explorer-chan, it was guaranteed that the next anime with characters based on inanimate objects would generate a large amount of buzz. And with the premise of showing us a fantastical interpretation of the adventures of the cells in our bodies, Hataraku Saibou drew in countless viewers and absolutely left its mark on the community. As a Pharmacy student, I waited eagerly for this show to start ever since it was announced, and the final result was still way beyond my expectations.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 7\\n\r\nSome people describe Hataraku Saibou as an educational anime, a label with which I disagree. Its purpose is pure, unadulterated entertainment, only using scientific concepts as a background, quite like how the Fate franchise handles History in its unique way. Hataraku Saibou avoids simply relying on its gimmick. Its structure is similar to many popular anime, particularly from the shonen genre/demographic, and incorporates exciting action scenes, short but well-crafted character arcs and frenzied twists in the latter parts of each episode. The first episode is a excellent summary of the basic formula and will most certainly captivate everyone who's open to the experience within its 24 minutes. Personal opinion incoming: anyone who didn't enjoy the conclusion of that first episode, where after a long chase, a lone germ is contained and put inside a missile named \"Sneeze\" which is then launched and detonated as cells all around rejoice and salute may be just too cynical to enjoy any work that's more light-hearted than Berserk.\\n\\n\r\nLatter episodes up the game by incorporating more intricate concepts that interpolate artistic vision and scientific knowledge, such as Memory Cells being portrayed as conspiracy theorists who warn other cells against an improbable catastrophe - just the way we know how allergy works - taking that chance to present conflicts among the characters. Drugs are represented as robots whose actions expire after a certain time and are seen as a total mystery by the human-styled cells. There are also episodes that provide backstory to some of the main characters and a moving redemption arc for a major villain later on.\\n\\n\r\nART: 7\\n\r\nOverall, the art style is nice and the animation is decent, though there is some variation in quality at times. The recycling of sequences and some visible bail-outs in regards to animation were noticeable in the TV broadcast, though DP is already known for its drastic retouches in its blu-ray releases. The overtly detailed and vibrant backgrounds may just be the greatest part of the art direction. Location design gets increasingly captivating with every new episode and we also have a major change in ambience in a final, more serious arc. The visual gags, one of the most universal aspects of Japanese comedy, are also very solid. Fights are extremely over-the-top, with blood flying everywhere and staining the white bodies of the Neutrophils, something which decidedly requires some effort to animate. The carefulness of the work is even surprising, knowing that at that moment, David Production was also busy with the year-long series Captain Tsubasa '18 and the much expected new season of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 10\\n\r\nAaaand here we have the strongest suit of Hataraku Saibou. The character design is simply one the best and most charismatically handled in recent memory, with the likeness of the main characters featuring heavily in fanart sites and in social networks. Even without any given names or complex backstories for many of them, we see an incredible, unique method characterization whose charm lies in its simplicity and faithfulness to the original concept - the human body itself. Knowing the biological properties of the cells beforehand, one can already expect some of the characters to have some specific traits, such as the Macrophage being an insanely powerful fighter. The Basophils and T-cells were also other personal favorites of mine. The monster design is spectacularly creative and all of the locations, as I implied before when praising the backgrounds, are evocative and very well-constructed. Trust me, you'll find yourself eagerly waiting to see how the next group of cells or organs look like.\\n\\n\r\nAnd of course, there's still the moe side of it all. The Platelets, for one, were an instant hit with the anime community and it's very easy to see why. The show goes all out on wives, too; fan favorites include Macrophage, NK Cell and Eosinophil. Fan theories, like the main character being a defective sickle cell, also run wild, showing the strong engagement that's already formed between these amazing characters and the fandom.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 7\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is fairly competent, with tense tracks playing during the fights and crises faced by the characters, triumphant fanfares at arc conclusions and comfy mood music during the Slice of Life sections. The opening theme is a fun collaboration among the voice actors; the ED is more on the generic side, but that is already decent enough for ClariS. Nevertheless, who steals the scene in the sound department are the CVs themselves, an all-star cast of seiyuu such as Kana Hanazawa, Daisuke Ono, Tomokazu Sugita, and a personal favorite as the narrator: Mamiko Noto. The snippets with them exclaiming the show's title between breaks will put a smile on your face.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 10\\n\r\nYour mileage may vary on this one. Over the past few years I've been studying Histology, Immunology, Hematology and Microbiology, among many other subjects, and all of them converge into the deliciously entertaining mix that is Hataraku Saibou, covering my overlapping interests in both Biology and anime.\\n\r\nYet, in my opinion, the final result is so ridiculously appealing that being overtly familiar with the subject matter is not a prerequisite to fully enjoy the series. One might even learn a thing or two here, or just sit back and enjoy the ride.\\n\\n\r\nHataraku Saibou is definitely worth the try as one of the most relevant anime from its season and hopefully, it will stand the test of time, bringing along the adaptations of the manga's next chapters and of its spin-offs.",

            "content": "Hataraku Saibou or Cells at Work has been highly praised despite his lack of story and the lack of characters just because it's unique and innovative.\r\nIf Hataraku Saibou can do something is to show that originality is not a guarantee of a good anime.\r\nThe show lacks something that i still cannot precisely explain. After the initial shock you quickly realize that despite its originality this anime is incredibly generic (does that make sense? i dunno but thats how i felt while watching this).\r\nStory: There is no story, this is kind of a simpsons slice of life where at the end of the day everything isfine and dandy. Episode 12 and 13 were the most entertaining of all of them because the story felt real even if just a little. Sadly i personally felt that the ep 13 was the worst animated of all them so it took a little bit of the magic of the finale to this anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt: It's David Production. It's good.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The VA's were perfect and both the opening and the ending are incredibly catchy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Probably the lowest point of the anime and the most cringy side of the anime fanbase stems from this part. \\n\r\nAside from probably the MC the rest of the characters hold no value.\\n\r\nYeah yeah platelet is cute but its a one trick pony that on my opinion exhausts its charm fairly quickly.\\n\r\nWhite Blood Cell is interesting but we never get to know him at all so he ends up at being plain and it feels like he is just a secondary character that its there. \\n\r\nIn the last episode we barely see him a few seconds until the finale.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: If you like gag mangas where nothing really matters then you might enjoy Hataraku Saibou.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: The show lacks value and intensity.  If i were to be a weeb i still wouldnt like it because there is no waifu material fight me.\\n\r\n If i were to treat Hataraku Saibou as a normal anime i wouldnt give it more than a 6.",

            "content": "This is one of the laziest shows I've ever seen.\r\nLazy characters. The main characters are each one of the cells of your immune system: red blood cell, white blood cell, etc. There is little reason to care about any of them, because they act similarly to their comrades and lack any defining traits that separates them from the trillions of cells like them. And any minuscule defining traits these characters show are being incompetent at their jobs or having backstories that don't matter in the slightest in regards to their development.\r\nLazy setting. Before we stray too far away from the topic of how many cellsthere are, this show does an abysmal job at representing how many cells actually exist in this world, and when being a cell of a body entitles you to have a human, sentient form or not. If blood cells can have human forms then why not every other freaking cell that exists in your body? Why can't parietal cells, ones that secrete stomach juices, be characters, huh? Why can't Melanocytes make a cameo alongside the loli platelets? Why do nutrients look like human food? This sounds like I'm picking apart something that's meant to be a quirky world that doesn't need to make sense, but it just looks and sounds so superficial and stupid. Especially when you consider...\\n\\n\r\nLazy story. Generic germs fight, anime explains what these germs do, generic cells fight back, anime explains what cells do. It honestly feels like you're watching a boring animated biology lecture for your school project. And even if you wanted to learn, it confuses you with these uncreative representations of how things look and work that you'll end up not learning anything.\\n\\n\r\nLazy execution. There are no stakes. Our main character cells don't die during times they should have. Are you seriously trying to tell me a premature red cell can fare against a big germ in a direct confrontation? Or that a hit from one of the deadliest afflictions of the human body against one white cell doesn't kill it? NO. And this is a problem because the show themes these events as suspenseful and tense, not to mention it fluctuates between comedy and drama in such a disingenuous way, always making comedic light or emotional moments of events that don't call for it.\\n\\n\r\nLazy comedy and drama. The drama derives of the cells not thinking they're good enough, then they become good enough, in the same episode. The comedy derives from characters' overreactions, characters which we discussed are boring and generic as they come.\\n\\n\r\nJust a lazy, lazy show.\\n\\n\r\nArt is good, stiff at times but still pretty decent. Nothing noteworthy of the soundtrack, OP and ED kinda suck but eh that's subjective. The design of the white blood cells is honestly great. It's just that I cannot fathom how it was thematically correct to have white blood cells have such unique designs, and yet have every other cell be a human in a uniform. WHY?!?\\n\\n\r\nThe only reason I stuck around for so long was to see how they tackle the most interesting and deadly disease, you know the one. And it lasts one and a half episodes. No one dies except an unimportant crowd of cells that have the word \"Cell\" written on their white t-shirts. Lazy.\\n\\n\r\nI'm so done. I don't get why people find this show funny, creative or emotionally investing in any regard.",

It becomes so cliche at point that I found myself cringing a bit, especially in this fourth episode. The show does a lot of fun things with it's setting butit never uses it for interesting story telling. The characters are a bit flat and 2dimensional (ha ha) and are about as developed as a loaf of bread.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is alright, it wouldn't find itself out of place among the ranks the average seasonal anime show, but nothing more than that. There was even an example of a clip of animation being used four times in the fourth episode, which just seems incredibly cheap to me. The shots are never impressive and the scenes are never noteworthy. It just seems like a the camera was plopped onto the scene, but never in any interesting ways, which isn't atypical to your standard anime but is definitely a point against it. \\n\\n\r\nIf you think that this gimmick alone is enough to stomach mediocre writing, okay to bad animation, decent sound, and flat characters then you should give it a watch. It's still enjoyable regardless and if you think you'll like it based on the concept you will probably like it.",

            "content": "Who would\u2019ve thought that such a series existed that had an imaginative way to learn about how the body's blood system works. I haven\u2019t come across anything like it in my time as an avid fan of anime so from that alone you can\u2019t help but be intriguingly interested. Hataraku Saibou (Cells at Work!) is a unique and terrifyingly accurate depiction on what actually happens during your body's never-ending fight against outside antigens, diseases and injuries. Whilst a semi-educational anime on human biology, rather than being boring, this anime is full of life and it includes elements of both shounen action and great comedy, allowingits audience to enjoy themselves while learning about how things function within the human body. From the smallest scrape to the most vicious bout of the common flu, everything that affects your system on the inside affects the day-to-day life of the trillions of cells keeping your body running smoothly. We then get to see how the body reacts to these injuries and bacteria and how the cells work together to combat or fix the issues at hand. \\n\\n\r\nLiterally, the story is in the title but these body cells of ours take humanoid form and are in this fantastical real-world-like city that is our body, which is constantly invaded by foreign agents. All the cells resemble people but the infections, bacteria, germs, viruses all look like monsters\u2014e.g. an influenza virus turns cells into zombies etc. Not sure what their jobs are? No worries, Cells at Work! explains it to you in the most digestible way. We follow the adventures of a Red Blood Cell, AE3803, who is our cheerful and spunky heroine who is unfamiliar with the blood vessels, causing her to get lost often while delivering goods. Her main task is to deliver oxygen, carbon dioxide and nutrients all over the body like the rest of her kind. There are lots of potential dangers along the way given the main narrative but the White Blood Cells are here to protect everyone. One recurring character, for example, our hero the White Blood Cell (Neutrophil) U-1146, who is part of the force that acts as the body\u2019s initial defence against foreign invaders and infectious diseases. He\u2019s depicted as a savagely violent man who is also polite. When the bad bacteria advances on our heroine, the White Blood Cell appears and attacks it until its eliminated. When this occurs, they are great action sequences and bloody violent but when you think about it, what the human body does to protect itself is quite violent to those invaders.\\n\\n\r\nFor being an anime about the human body, Cells at Work! is surprisingly accurate. Even little things are thought about, including the way that the Red Blood Cells have reversible jackets for when they are carrying oxygen versus when they are carrying carbon dioxide. Or scenes where White Blood Cells break through the ceiling, exclaiming that they can pass between veins. It is clear that extensive research was done before the careful planning of this series. There is plenty of adventures and even a potential love interest between our hard-working Red Blood Cell protagonist and the mysterious but powerful White Blood Cell agent who protects her. There is a real chemistry with those two and their history goes way back to events prior to the main story, there is an alluring charm to their relationship that makes you want more of it. There are other recurring characters like the buff Killer-T Cell, the strong NK Cell, the Macrophage, Fat Cell, Helper T Cell, the adorable Platelets and many more. They appear in a monster/catastrophe-of-the-week type of format and get to see their specific roles and how they protect the body from such things.\\n\\n\r\nDavid Production is the studio behind the revamped JoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure series and their works with it some of the best in the industry, but you can kind of see that their busy schedule with other projects started to show in the animation here for some parts\u2014maybe not enough time but there were serval times where the quality drops and you can see some short-cuts like recycling a lot of sequences\u2014e.g, like Platelets directing traffic. But either than that it\u2019s still pretty good and I like how the animation goes wild in the action sequences and how blood sprays all over the White Blood Cells (Neutrophils) when they eliminate the monsters, they become drenched in it, it\u2019s a nice touch because they are literally white (even their clothes) and visually it looks cool. Character designs are really great a lot are so distinctive like how the Neutrophils are all plain white, Platelets look like children and Killer-T Cells are built like soldiers. The backgrounds get progressively detailed and introduce a new facet of the world with each passing episode as it goes through different sections of the body and the architecture designs along with the colour palette are beautiful. Most of this is credited to the mangaka in Akane Shimizu. \\n\\n\r\nThe Opening to this anime really outshines the Ending, it really is catchy and you can\u2019t help me in a good mood and even sing along as embarrassing as that may sound, but its true! \u201cMission! Ken Kou Dai Ichi\u201d is actually done by the some of the voice acting team, our heroine (Kana Hanazawa), U-1146 (Tomoaki Maeno), Killer T Cell (Daisuke Ono) and Macrophage (Kikuko Inoue). Its upbeat, cheery and has a lot of energy. And speaking of the Seiyuu, they all had strong performances especially our heroine who is the heart and soul of the series. I think the choice for the narrator was spot on given the educational aspect, like a Siri type of tone and it makes sense since the narration is info dumping the details of the human body. With so much information coming at you, the added wording on the screen can be a bit much at times. The included text is usually helpful, providing context for characters and narration on how the body is dealing with specific changes. It gives just enough information to be informative but admittedly it can be slightly burdensome to read them. \\n\\n\r\nCells at Work! is clearly an anime you can\u2019t watch without thinking given how informative and accurate it is. Even the humour often stems from interactions between the characters and their various roles within the body which mean you can only truly enjoy this series if you are able to understand what\u2019s actually going on. As entertainment, the fights between all the different germs, bacteria, viruses and the body's systems keep viewers interested. But the real value here is the creativity in explaining the human body and how it works. This is genius work here, who would have thought that the tropes of shounen action and comedy and a tour of anthropomorphising the human body's circulatory system would mesh so well? That\u2019s the brilliance of Akane Shimizu. I wish for this anime to be used to help students understand and remember the biology information they have learned in school, in a much more entertaining way.\\n",

The comedy is hilarious and I found myself laughing a lot of times, which I don't tend to do with most comedies.\r\nStory: 9\r\nThere isn't much of a standard story, of course, the basic is that we follow the cells in our body, working in their special fields, in a city-like setting.\r\nBut theseries is episodic, where we get to learn more about a different cell each episode. We even get to learn about the viruses and bacterias! I like that a lot, it's very enjoyable and educational! But with each episode having different focus points and plot, there will probably be episodes I love and some I didn't enjoy as much, so far I like them all tho!\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThe art isn't outstanding, but I do find that the design of the characters and the setting in which they live is very creative and nice! I like that the organs and functions of the body is represented as little people or as buildings and structures! And the animation is perfectly fine too! As an animator myself I could not do any better lol!\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nGot to be honest, I'm not good with reviewing sound at all, but for me, it was quite nice to listen to! I found the soundeffects to be appropriate and the voice actors are awesome! Also, the theme song is catchy and cute.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\r\nThis is the best part of the series, the main cast is lovable, and they are simplistic, they have one purpose and they stick to that purpose, none of them really have any sad, depressing backstory or anything, they are straight to the point, lovable and funny! I love them all, especially best girl Macrophage.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime so much! It had me laughing so many times, I would rewind scenes that would make me laugh the hardest, and learning about all the cells and viruses in the middle of the plot was lovely, and I love the narrators voice very much!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nSo far this is the best anime I've watched in 2018, but I don't watch everything seasonal so I can't say if there's anything that's possibly better than this, but from everything I've seen, this is my favorite, and I am excited to watch more episodes.\\n\\n\r\nWe are Cells at Work!",

            "content": "Hataraku Saibou might be one of if not the best educational anime out there. While feeding you information on a pretty wide variety of biology and anatomy related topic it managed to mix it with a healthy dose of comedy, action and drama without feeling any of those feeling tacked on.\r\nThe show revolves around a human body being represented as one huge city, inside which the human looking cells diligently go about doing their jobs the keep everything in good condition. Just from this it should be clear that there\u2019s plenty of artistic license taken when it comes to depicting a human body and everythingwithin in but the show remains surprisingly faithful the topic and doesn\u2019t mislead the viewer or try to distort facts enough to make a narrative out of it. \\n\r\nIf have a google search license you can try and find a bunch of threads where an actual doctor breaks down what happens in the episodes in detail to see the full extent of it. Even something that might seem unrelated to biology or unrealistic might turn out to be rooted deep in reality. The show won\u2019t go on explaining you a lot of this stuff cause a lot of it is fairly advanced but it\u2019s nice to know that author has a good understanding of what he\u2019s working with and dedicated to implementing into the world and story. Maybe people with more specialized knowledge will be able to get a lot more enjoyment out of this show than the average viewer.\\n\\n\r\nNot that you need to know anything at all to enjoy this show. The main narrative is usually centered around things that a easier to explain like how blood circulates, what body does to combat various types of bacteria and viruses, how allergy or heat stroke affect your body, what happens when you get a wound, etc. On top of that we\u2019re usually seeing this all from the perspective of our clueless protagonist,AE-3803, a clumsy red blood cell who just recently started her duty of delivering oxygen and nutrients to other cells. \\n\\n\r\nWith this premise show manages to effortlessly go between comedy, drama and action incredibly smoothly. First of all there a lot of SoL and humorous bits that usually revolve around how characters interact with each other or their environment which all feel fresh even if you\u2019ve seen similar gags before simply because of the premise. There\u2019s not that many comedic anime I can really connect to but this one managed to get a solid laugh out of me almost every episode. It helps a lot that this time around pretty much every joke is based on something every living human can probably relate to. \\n\\n\r\nEach episode also usually has some form of treat present in one way or another. For example aforementioned wound is a disaster for cells in and of itself but a wound also means that it\u2019s easier for germs and bacteria to get in and try to start mess inside your body. When it\u2019s nothing serious the show will stick to just starting a hilarious bloodbath with battle crazy neutrophils but surprisingly enough there\u2019s more nuance to be had here. \\n\\n\r\nWhile it\u2019s obviously a step away from the more scientific elements of the show, at times we get to see how cells feel about what\u2019s happening in your body and about their dangerous but important duty to keep the host safe and working. It might not teach you anything new but I\u2019d bet a lot of people leave this show wanting to take better care of their body after seeing a dramatic depiction of what we consider completely trivial. Things like cells inside your body being created and taught how to do their job or how much of a threat it can be to get a cold or go on without proper nutrition. Part of makes this seemingly nonsensical dramatic part work is that it doesn\u2019t quite linger on anything to act like you should be on the edge of your seat, waiting to see if the body will manage to overcome the problem that you likely faced yourself many times but instead smoothly transitions into solution and a sweet and cheerful conclusion of everything being put into order and cells celebrating another victory for them and the body they live in. Show\u2019s finale was extremely satisfying because it took everything I mentioned before and put them in a tight package during the final episodes that took the show to a new high on almost every level except for visual.\\n\\n\r\nProbably most unfortunate part of HS is that while it\u2019s an very entertaining and wholesome show, I feel like its strength most of the time come from the manga and anime doesn\u2019t quite offer that much compared to it. Sure, having everything voiced is nice but the visual department is lacking a lot. There are many places where instead of proper animation we get to see a shaky screen or a camera pan over a still frame or short animation loop, which is shame cause when action in HS can look pretty cool when depicted well. A lot of the shots feel like an uninspired panel to panel adaptation which almost never looks good when brought over to a different medium. Color palette is pleasing enough to the eyes during brighter sections of the show but when it shifts to darker colors it starts to look very dull when uninteresting shots are couples with poor color composition, last two episodes are one of the few exceptions where they show that those sections could\u2019ve looked much better. This is once again the biggest downfall of the show to me cause it constantly affect the quality of scenes that could\u2019ve had much more impact.\\n\\n\r\nMusic is a bit of a mixed bag too but it leans towards a better side. While there\u2019s plenty of fairly generic tracks that do their bare minimum to enhance the scene, the battle tracks are pretty damn good across the board. They do a great job of adding to the scale and threat when a disaster occurs. Either way the characters are talking so often that music is rarely allowed to take over, at times even being mixed so low that you can barely notice it\u2019s there at all.\\n\\n\r\nWhile not at all flawless, Hataraku Saibou is still a great package overall that I can recommend to pretty much everyone. It\u2019s relatively unique in its premise and execution. It will probably teach you something new about your body and possibly make you appreciate it just a bit more.",

Indeed,the two main characters ,red/white blood cell,impressed you a lot,but the supporting characters are also memorable .I have a hunch that I would hardly forget the adorable platelets,the serene but also aggressive maids macrophages,the eerie ninja basophil ,the virile and muscular T-cells ,the miserable and doomed cancer cells,and so on.Each of them is so individual and subtly created in reference with their practical functions in real life.To be frank,David Production ,as well as the writer Shimizu has the techniques in making you infatuated with the characters created and immersive in that fantastic world setting.\\n\r\nHowever,it is a bit ironic that your cells are living in such a society\uff0cwhich you might call Utopia or authentic Communism without exploitation and sordid currency circulation system\uff08well\uff0cregardless of the fact that they don\u2019t have an option to select their occupations \uff09,whereas you are being compelled to struggle hard ,work like a dog,and watch Hataraku Saibou at the same time as eating instant noodle to appease your hunger. From this perspective,we might find more resonances from the manga Hataraku Saibou Black rather than this TV series(lol).\\n\r\nNevertheless,don\u2019t be crestfallen by comparison,see,they are always bouncy rather than being jaded,protecting you and fighting for you relentlessly without a pause.Consequently\uff0cshall we give them some positive responses ? :\uff09\\n\r\nIn a word,I hope you enjoy the show !",

            "content": "While there is no denying that Hataraku Saibou is unique and innovative, people seem to believe this, by itself, makes it a great anime. It does not.\r\nDon't get me wrong, I enjoyed this anime, and thought it would be a great idea to teach kids about biology, but the anime itself is lackluster.\r\nStory: 4/10\r\nA slice of life anime that follows the daily activities of a red and white blood cell. We get to see in detail how the body reacts to different problems and learn more about how the body works. HS gets points for accurate biology and for a novel idea, but unlike yourtypical SOL anime, It's impossible to relate to the characters, because A) They're blood cells. And B) They're tropes, exaggerated with the intent to amuse kids. Also, since episodes are designed to be stand alone, it defeats the purpose of a SOL anime.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition to this, because the story is sub-par and to make sure they appeal to kids, they also made it a shounen battle anime. Where nobody important ever dies, the good guys always win, and it's the weak character we were just introduced to who doubts themselves only to be the hero and defeat the bad guy at the end. But it's also a Shounen battle anime, where we don't really care about any of the characters, and villains are introduced and defeated in single episodes which is very tedious.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\r\nNothing mind blowing or innovative, but it's still good quality, and pleasing to look at. Excpet the fight scenes. Boy are they lacking in excitement.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nMeh. Nothing bad. Just nothing memorable, or catchy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 4/10\\n\r\nOh boy. I mean, I know they're cells. One of trillions of virtually identical cells, but that's still not a good reason to make them all the same. You could literally swap out the main characters in HS, for another of the same cell, and the series would be exactly the same. All characters are tropes, and no attempt is made at development, aside from hints at some kind of attraction between Red and White.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the first 2-3 episodes. It was very educational, and biologically correct, which I really enjoyed, but then I realized that a novel idea and biological accuracy were the only things this show had going for it. I think the entire anime maybe got a handful of chuckles out of me, which as a gag anime, is quite pathetic. It became a chore to watch the following episodes, hoping against hope that maybe the show might develop into something good. (It doesn't). \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe gimmick of following the Cells in your body is interesting, but not enough to put up with such a boring story, bad writing, and 2D generic trope characters who you don't care about. If anyone remembers the show Ozzy and Drix, it was a similar idea, but one much better executed (albeit with worse art).\\n\\n\r\nIf I ever have kids, I might watch it again for educational reasons, but aside from that, I never want to see this show again.\\n",

            "content": "Hataraku Saibou is an abstract interpretation of how the human body operates as a system, portraying the human body as a society of people (or rather cells) in which all these people have certain tasks to do. This system is constantly under attack, with the main drive of the series being to showcase how this society endures all of the threats placed upon it. There's not exactly a market for this type of show since biology, an exact science, represented as an abstract concept, by being rebuilt into a system that retains the basic notions within the exat science and changed into something else, isnot exactly something that rolls off the tongue, just like this description of the show. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, I find that this show can be a good experience for anyone that enjoys observing how systems work, as the show mainly deals with how this society works and how it keeps itself alive as well and the body they are within. Every cell has a role within the body which mostly revolves around it remaining functional. The average episode presents a certain issue that is occurring inside the body and then the cells combat things such as diseases, injuries and even allergies to solve it. Through this episodic process a variety of cell types are presented, as well as how they act within the body and what role they have. The general purpose of each cell is there, as well as that of every ailment, so you can get a general idea of how everything works inside your body if you lacked the knowledge. Observing the imagination behind the parallels between how the human body behaves normally from ailments that we have all suffered and how they are presented on screen can have great entertainment value as well. As long as you do not expect a comprehensive and realistic interpretation of the body, you can find some enjoyment out of observing this system at work.\\n\\n\r\nThe series itself is simple and it has an outlandish idea, which can bring a lot of appeal to itself. But I can foresee it being a negative experience if you seek meaning out of the system it presents. You see I consider that in world building whenever you create a setup, two rules often determine its quality. The first rule, is that you can easily change the setup of the world and the story would continue making sense. The second rule is that while the setup the series has is not mandatory to its success, the fact that it was setup that way enhances the experience in a way changing it would not. In the case of this show, changing the setup would cause the series to lose both appeal, and stop functioning properly. What it presents only functions in its own box. There's not a lot to analyze the series on, and all you an take in is how the author reimagined the body working as. As a result the world is flawed and this very thing can cause problems, which it indeed does.\\n\\n\r\nFor instance, while the system created within the story and how the body breaks down whenever it suffers of a certain problem can be interesting, the characters couldn't be any further from being interesting. You see, the cause of this is essentially due to the show doing a great job at showing what every cell is capable of and their duty. The setup they are part of forced them to act in only an one note way because that's the only way they will make sense in it. Because of this, every character is entirely predictable and there is little to no variation in how these characters act. So whenever the series either tries to do that dumb japanese character driven style of humor, you can predict every joke to come and find it unfunny as a result. Not to mention that because all characters retain the same behavior consistently and a lot of them are copy pastes of each other, not only are the jokes predictable from the very start, but they also get repeated. A lot. So it is hard to even consider this show a comedy. The second issue characters have is that, since you know the exact behavior they will have or are supposed to have, you know exactly what character arc they will have. This is a critical issue when presenting backstory episodes, which are inconsequential and meaningless since you can end up having to sit through 20 minutes of something you could determine on your very own in 30 seconds about the characters. Since the characters are only interesting when related to the system and how they combat an internal problem, focusing on them individually is gonna hurt the watching experience.\\n\\n\r\nI also have to warn you, that because the series has an episodic format, if the basic essence of what the series does is not going to grip you from the very beginning, things won't change whatsoever later down in the series. Characters don't have any motivations and it's not like the body evolves or has any plotlines happening inside of itself, as the goal of this series is not to tell a story, but present the author's way of envisioning how the body works. There's no story for you to consume, and as a result there's nothing you can want or expect out of this series. What you see is what you get and the decision can be comfortably made by your level of interest in biology and how well battle shounen tropes resonate with you, as the series does treat itself as such during action moments. Which the series contains plenty of. Your first experience with the series can easily be used as your point of reference in regards to continuing to watch this series or not as it constantly delivers the same experience over and over, except for the times it attempts to be character driven.\\n\\n\r\nHataraku Saibou is a pretty simple experience despite its original idea. It suffers of a great deal of flaws but it is fairly easy to decide whether or not to watch it. If you enjoy the idea behind the basic premise of the show, I am sure that at the very least the show can be interesting. As long as you do not expect anything complex and just watch for entertainment value, it shouldn't have much difficulty to get you there. It's also a very low risk series to try out since, by the time your first experience with the show is done, you know exactly how every future episode will be structured and can form healthy expectations. As long as the backstory won't harm you, you should be good if you determine this is something you can enjoy. However, all this series presents you is an idea and a system. It presents you with no story, no noteworthy characters and a world that you know exactly how will behave. It has the static feeling of a slice of life but also contains battle shounen elements, which is an odd combination that I can see failing for a lot of people. But at the same time I can just as easily picture people being charmed by it due to what it presents being one of a kind and something closely related to everyone.",

            "content": "*Disclaimer*\r\nJust personal scratch.\r\nAdvised, possible spoilers.\r\nOpinion & Informal\r\nArt: 5/10 I wasn't too impressed by the art. It was fine at times and it was sort of just bad at other times. For example, one of the few instances where I thought the art wasn't up to par was episode 10 with the (I forgot the exact name) with the hazmat suit character (later finding out it's just macrophage). If you want to take a look, during the foot bath/drinking chug by hazmat suit cell, just look at how that was drawn. Almost zero dimensionality and shading. You can even see they dropped frames during the chuganimation. The proportions and anatomy of the characters was fine for the most part but there were some questionable instances of quality control such as the episode with the activated killer T cell. The bit where it shows a frontal shot of the newly activated killer T cell has really questionable looking arms; those arms look like they were drawn by an Art 101 student. There weren't any impact shots that really left an impact. None of the instances of art showcase in this show left me with any good impressions. Many shots and expanses were reused multiple times throughout the show. For example, the red blood cell transport junction expanse was used at least 5 times in those 13 episodes. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 4/10 The animation wasn't good, objectively. Objectively. However, just because a show has bad animation, doesn't mean it's bad. A good story can easily make terrible animation a masterpiece. As a reminder I'm talking about animation here, not story. I'm going explain why the animation in this show was bad. There were was a more than usual amount of shortcuts taken. I'm not impressed when there are unfitting shortcuts in a 13 episode show. Multiple freeze shots, pan shots, repeat shots, and reused animation. Freeze shots were used in place of a lot of the action. For example, the sequence begins with white blood cell charging at the germ and the last frame of the sequence is a still shot of the slash post completion. Freeze shots are okay, but it sort of felt it was used more than other methods of action animation shortcuts such as pan shots. The pan shots were also shortcuts taken for the action. It's the same thing except it pans the frame to simulate some sort of movement. Repeat shots were most noticeable in episode 10: things like animated slashes that are repeated once or twice to extend the sequence and present impact. Finally, why was there a need to use semi-extended flashbacks, multiple times, in a 13 episode show? Episode 10 is also an example of where multiple flashbacks where used. My last gripe is how the exposition was used as a way to save on animation. For example, any introduction (or reintroduction, another shortcut) on a cell or germ was a 10-20 second expositional freeze shot. Overall, the shortcuts that you would normally see in a 100+ episode shounen were used in this 13 episode show. I understand budget limitations, but I would prefer source:translation flexibility such as cutting out the action for more biology class instead of terribly animated action.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6/10 The character designs were neat and fitting. None of the designs seemed too off. Other than character designs, it was somewhat stale to make their personalities tied to their cell function. There wasn't too much flavor to the characters other than their outward interactions. In other words, it didn't feel like any of the characters actually thought. They seemed like they were acting because they were their cell. White blood cell was the only slight exception. What I mean is that killer T cell acted like killer T cell. Killer T cell, despite his own backstory episode's contents, he still seemed like a meat-head in all other interactions. I feel like, \"because it's my job\" was just a cop-out for skimping on the character development. \\n\\n\r\nPlot: 6/10 It was such an interesting idea. I actually wouldn't have minded if the whole show was just a biology class, but I think it tried to hard to humanize or individualize some of the characters. Killer T cell and the commander didn't need their own episode because they were side characters with almost zero appeal and flavor (to me personally). \\n\\n\r\nDevelopment: 4/10 A 13 episode show just so happened to have 2 filler episodes. The first was the killer T cell dedicated episode. The second was the return of Staphylococcus episode. Why does killer T and the commander get their own episode? The premise and plot of that whole episode was just ugh. Macrophage is probably way more popular than those two losers so why didn't she get a dedicated episode? Why couldn't have there just been another informational episode such as showcasing the functions of certain organs, the synthesis of proteins or DNA replication.? Red blood cell never really developed substantially throughout the whole show. She was still prone to getting lost, just a bit less than when she was first introduced. I thought it was interesting to see the state of their world, the body in which they reside, change as a result of things such as heat stroke, cancer cell proliferation, and major blood loss.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 5/10 The OP and ED songs were okay. The bgm was average too. The soundboard was sort of lacking and there was no sound design to note.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: 5/10 A more traditional open-ended ending for the future: gives a super short cameo of each of the characters as it builds up to the MC marching onward to the future. There were no questions to be answered and it didn't create any new ones. A pretty uneventful and unmemorable conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10 I thought it was okay. The only things I disliked about this show were the animation and direction it took in character development. \\n\\n\r\nEdit: 3/25/19\\n\r\nSmall grammar and punctuation fixes \\n\\n",

            "content": "Ever wondered what is actually happening in your body? But are you too lazy to go and pick up a biology book? Fret not, because Hataraku Saibou (Cells at Work!) is here to get you interested using anime-fied cells. All your cells are now anime characters, designed to be the personification of their respective cells. And they are working really hard to make sure your body stays alive well and healthy.\r\nHataraku Saibou is a parody of your cells inside the body. It uses the scientific base as a setting or premise, then adds their own twist to make it more interesting and exciting to watch.At times, it adds momentarily pause to a scene to explain the scientific basis of a cell, virus, or event that's happening. It is mainly a comedy, and it won't focus too much on making everything as scientific as possible.\\n\\n\r\nWe will mainly follow two main characters, a Red Blood Cell and a White Blood Cell (more specifically a neutrophil). The Red Blood Cell is terrible at directions, and this will be a running gag that is used occasionally. The Red Blood Cell and White Blood Cell that we follow will get involved every time something is happening to their world (our body), be it a wound, invasion of bacterias, or cancer. This anime looks at each cell's actual real functions, then create a character that does that job, while adding fitting stereotypes. The result is that each cell as a character has their own trait that will be easily recognizable when you watch the show.\\n\\n\r\nHataraku Saibou is episodic. Each episode (or sometimes two) usually tells about one disaster that has struck the body. The disaster and problems that appear does not incite suspense, because you can predict that the disaster is resolved by the end of the episode. Instead, it's interesting to see how the anime handles the problems that happen and how it's going to be represented. The scenes usually switch around between action and comedy. A lot of the comedy is from hyperbole and parody, while the action is from the various types of white blood cell fighting and killing the antigens. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation of the action looks great on the surface, but a portion is actually just still frames with a few effects added in. This can also apply for the animation in general. It may look fine on the surface, but some parts may feel cheap to some people. So it feels like a mix of good parts and bad parts. This anime also uses CG to animate some parts like walking crowds of cells.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Hataraku Saibou is a good and entertaining comedy that parodies the human body. Characters are stereotyped according to their real cell functions. They are used for comedy alongside the problems encountered by the body. The animation may feel cheap at times, but it is good enough to not be bad. Give it a try and you might find enjoyment out of it.",

Biology is a boring subject but this anime allows us to find out the cells in our body and their purpose in the most amusing way ever! Our body functions like a city where cells live together and work together keeping the \"city that is constantly in threat\" safe.\r\nThe anime explains bio in a fun and interesting manner and I'm pretty sure research was put in to make this possible because it seems that everything portrayed was pretty accurate!\r\nso, having said, I highly recommendthe anime to just about anyone especially those looking to learn about cells in a more fun and less boring way!",

Here's how the show works. The cells in your body are personified into a gigantic colony of blue collar workers, with the normal bodily functions are represented as machinery. So far so good, but here's the catch. Most of the characters are one dimensional and uninteresting, and the character design are just the same 10 models repeated a million time. I think this isan intentional decision by DP, since human cells are just mindless organic robots. But for characters in a show, this gets boring real quick.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnd the show tries to explain the functions of each type of cell through little snippets of narration. Each time a cell does something new on screen, the show pauses and goes \"this cell does this through the use of this to do that\". It's kinda annoying how the show keeps doing this every now and then.\\n\\n\r\nCurrently Hataraku Saibou has 2 tags on MAL: comedy and shounen. The main problem I have with this show is that it is not a shounen anime. the overall tone of the show feels like it's likely aimed at a younger demographic with a basic recipe of\\n\r\n-Life in a human body sure is nice and peaceful\\n\r\n-Oh no there's a virus/bacteria what do we do now\\n\r\n-Look there's a whatever-cell here to save the day\\n\r\n-Whatever-cell beats the foreign entity with the power of biology and narration\\n\r\n-The body is safe again\\n\r\nWash, rinse, repeat.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOh yea almost forgot \\n\r\nThe fight scenes are bad. Even terrible. Everything looks cheap and dull, every action is just a static image on a flashy rushing background. Accompanied by an absurd amount of blood and gore.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, 4/10",

Cells of the human body to be precise. \r\nI never really liked studying so I kind of disliked this show at first.. Anyway, it has a very unique plot and storyline. Japan never ceases to amaze you.... Even Cells have been affected by the Japanizing beam.\r\nThe artstyle is centered around making everything, especially the characters as cute as possible and the anime knows it as well. \r\nYes, this is a series you can watch with the family regardless of the bloody fight scenes.Since this anime is child-friendly, older audience might find it boring. \\n\\n\r\nI fall asleep during my biology class in school. To be honest, I also fell asleep many times when I was watching this show. This proves that the education from this anime is legit. \\n\\n\r\nOddly enough, parents can watch this along with their kids because there is a sense of humour for adults that kids would not understand. \\n\\n\r\nSo.. regarding recommendation if you should watch this series is... If you're really into biology, then this series is for you.. If you only want to see this because you stumbled upon it as an internet fad and you want to see it for meme material, then I suggest you think twice about it.. Because you're only going to drop the series after the first episode, I guarantee it. \\n\\n\r\nIt was a decent show to be honest. I can't say much though.",

            "content": "Tl;dr\r\nPros:\r\n1. The way the cells and human body is designed is creative.\r\n2. The soundtrack is really good.\r\nCons:\r\n1. The story is repetitive and bland for the entire first half.\r\n2. The characters are just walking tropes and uninteresting.\r\nAs someone who studied biology in high school, let me just say that it isn't exactly super exciting. And I quite like biology. So it is nice to see an anime that has such a creative take on how cells look like and how the human body is transformed into a city. If you took biology, you will know that this is way better than boring walls of text filledwith technical jargon to memorise. In particular, I like the design of the various organs, such as the heart being a temple with a drum to represent the heartbeat and the lungs being a futuristic factory pumping oxygen into gas tanks.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is also pretty stellar. There are many tense moments in Hataraku Saibou and the soundtrack does a great job of enhancing that feeling. It makes the fights against dangerous pathogens all the more intense. After all, if not for our immune systems these pathogens will kill us quickly. The ED is also very cheerful, giving a feeling of hope and peace as each disaster is averted.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the praising stops there. Hataraku Saibou is very shallow in terms of content. To put an analogy, it is a gift box that has been wrapped up real pretty, but containing absolutely nothing within. For the first half, each episode uses a rinse and repeat method: Red Blood Cell is directionally challenged, a pathogen invades, Red Blood Cell finds herself in grave danger, White Blood Cell comes to her rescue, \"die germ!\", but it didn't work, new immune cell comes to the rescue. The series got old really fast and it was aggravating to watch each episode just to find the same story again and again and again. The story does get better towards the end when the story starts to focus more on other health issues besides pathogens but even then, it isn't super interesting or unique enough to be worth watching the preceding episodes.\\n\\n\r\nAnd to make the mediocre story worse, the characters suffer from the common anime mistake of making one-dimensional characters based on tropes. Red Blood Cell is constantly lost, Killer T Cell is an angsty military bufflord, White Blood Cell is a stalker because he doesn't dare to confront Red Blood Cell etc. The characters are hardly likable and show no growth as a character, making the series even harder to sit through.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, while Hataraku Saibou is amazing at its visuals and soundtrack, its story and characters are just so terrible it makes the anime difficult to enjoy. And ultimately, an anime is only as strong as its weakest link, and Hataraku Saibou's insufferable story and characters really bring down its quality.",

There's no story or continuity and the characters are just cardboard cutouts with no personalities. The two leads, Red Blood Cell and White Blood Cell, only exist so you have someone to follow or root for during each episode.\r\nThe art gets a 5/10 because the character designs mostly fall flat and the backgrounds seem a little too far removed from the actual environment they're in. Most of the time it just looks like they're in some generic city, which feels like a missed opportunity for more creativelocations. The bacteria and virus character designs are better than the designs for the cell characters, who are all very generic; the cell characters don't visually represent what they are enough. This is particularly egregious for the white blood cells: Literally just generic dudes wearing a generic cap and generic clothes, but they have a white color pallette. Oooh, so creative. /s\\n\\n\r\nHowever, what turned me off most was the overuse of exposition break: Throughout each episode I've seen, the show will pause to deliver exposition on whatever bacteria or bodily function is being introduced, and it often goes on for too long. Unless you're watching this specifically for the educational value, these get very disruptive very quickly. I decided to watch this to be entertained, so the only thing those exposition breaks did for me was take me out of the story. \\n\\n\r\nFor what it is\u2014a cute educational series about the human body\u2014it's fine, but as someone who prefers character above all else and easily gets bored of the monster-of-the-week setup, it's just not for me.",

            "content": "Who would have thought that an anime based on the daily life of the cells of the human body would be one of the revelations of the year 2018? Based on the manga of the same name, written by Akana Shimizu, Hataraku Saibo has enchanted both locals and strangers. I do not lie when I tell that I think I have learned more from this series than in my entire school life with my biology classes. And, it is not secret that even doctors and specialists recommend the series for its veracity, precision and ingenuity. I must also confess that the videos of doctors commentingon the series are some of the most enjoyed as a complement to this journey, as it not only validates the resources and narrative proposals of the series from the theoretical, but also complements the knowledge that it tries to extend to the audience. 'Learning was never more entertaining' is one of the phrases that is used a lot to describe this series and, clearly, I can not agree more.\\n\\n\r\nIn general, the series tells the adventures and misadventures of two of our protagonists: The red blood cell AE-3803 - the main thread of the adventure - and a white blood cell U-1146. Also, in each chapter we are faced with a problem that can range from a cold to the appearance of cancer cells, which will also involve the introduction of new cells (characters) that will enrich the cast and win our hearts. While the series takes the format of a narration of particular stories that will involve the characters depending on the case treated, not providing a complex linear proposal, the characters and narrated cases are made enjoyable, fun and witty. How do our cells work in different scenarios? The series responds to this question through an approach that uses comic and action quite well, which means that, for example, the elimination of a bacterium is entertaining or that the elimination of cancer cells gives us a bloody grief.\\n\\n\r\nThe anthropomorphization of our cells and their environment (the human body) is also made in a good way, since it is also quite entertaining to discover all the references that are sometimes camouflaged (eg, the hat and the reversible jacket of our protagonist ). Although the quality of the animation is untidy in some parts, the visual proposal fulfills the task quite well. I must also emphasize that the design of characters and the visual proposal to portray this type of story fascinates me and it seems quite intelligent (claps for the mangaka for tremendous proposal). Likewise, the music accompanies the series well, providing energy and a fun atmosphere to the story. The OP becomes iconic with its sticky \"1 2 3 4. We are Cells At Work. 1 2 3 4. We are hataraku huu \"and not to mention the cast of endearing voices that give life to the cells.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, the series is a light entertainment worthwhile. I would say, clearly and simply, that it is a series that makes you happy. With adequate doses of comedy and a lot of constant energy from the plot and its characters, is a series that is easy to follow. In addition, it raises interesting and more than informative stories that makes you interested in the characters aka the cells of the body, and want to investigate more about them (their nature, their functioning, etc). Therefore, the series also plays an educational role that works, an element that very few products can boast. In short, one of the most interesting proposals of the year 2018. 7.5/10.\\n\\n\\n",

The problem is that it quickly becomes stale, since every episode is almost the same, but with a different health problem. The ending is pretty anticlimactic. [SPOILERS] They should have had saved cancer for the end and somehow combined it with hemorrhagic shock. Since it's pretty stupid how theygot rid of the cancerous cell without chemotherapy or something like this.  [END OF SPOILERS]\\n\\n\r\nYes, the comparison with Osmosis Jones is inevitable. With the difference that the western movie (and its subsequent cartoon) is better because the plot lines are different between the episodes, when Cells At Word doesn't even has any plot to keep the public watching and continuously interested. \\n\\n\r\nAnd seriously. People are saying \"I learned more from it than from biology classes\", but this is pretty dumb. You shouldn't skip classes and put your trust in an animated TV series. It would be pretty stupid to do something like this. Come on, you don't even remember the name of the cells other than white and red blood cells. It may work as a complement, but not as a substitute.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Hataraku Saibou is nice to watch, but nothing more. Storywise, Osmosis Jones may not be brilliant, but is actually better than this.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Hataraku Saibou is a Japanese animated show which could be considered an example of the \"anime de wakaru\" genre in which the main focus is to explain -- in a brief and concise manner, the basic outline pertaining specific subjects or topics, the aforementioned being human physiology, in this case.\r\nJust like every other work of its kind, it employs its characters and/or anthropomorphic beings to represent concepts or ideas which are necessary to convey the meaning behind what is being explained, this is essentially an alternative way of learning which relies on visual input rather than a pragmatic approach, but my complaints with these kindof shows are always the same, not enough information -- which is the most common problem rather than oversaturation or irrelevant information, and also the fact that some of them treat their audiences like \"dummies\", hence the name of this sort of works in English \"[subject] for dummies\" those two points are pretty much my only two problems with Hataraku Saibou.\\n\\n\r\nI'm fairly sure that at some point when I was a pre-grad I was reading this book on human physiology and thinking to myself \"wow, the whole opsonization and antigen presentation process in cell-mediated immunity sounds like a huge police taskforce performing a raid on some organized criminal organization\" because it felt to me as if the major histocompatibility complex was essentially like, a preset identification system for every citizen who was born in the human body, so whenever there was something that didn't seem like it belonged in there they would go like \"hey you, we need to ask you some questions\" and then it was like sometimes bacteria can get away with showing something similar to an ID that would allow them to enter the body bypassing the macrophages in the epithelial cell barrier or actually using them, maybe hiding inside one of the law-abiding citizens or on the other hand they would be stopped by one of these officers somewhere around one the checkpoints within the reticuloendothelial system and then they would discover they don't have an ID and they would get killed on the spot else they get an arrest warrant, which is proliferation in a nutshell, everything seems so suitable for a professional police investigation team that can use high-end technology like genetic profiling and other cool intelligent weapons like complement, cytokines and basically hack into the machinery of the human body on a mollecular level in order to create an inflammatory cascade and thwart the strategies used by the different pathogens that could invade the human body, because I feel that at the same time most bacteria don't even \"break into\" the bloodstream killing everything they see, they are more like silent, sneaky criminals that operate in the margin of society, unbeknownst to the unsuspecting citizens working under the direction of the central nervous system and its respective administrative branches, the endocrine, respiratory and circulatory division, an extremely organized system functioning everyday for the greater good (homeostasis), everything seemed to fit so perfectly in my mental image of some kind of hive-like society fighting against foreign criminals.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that is the exact reason why looking at this whimsical portrayal of the human physiology leaves me a bit disappointed, because I feel that it clashes with my own vision of what I learned back in med school, that which I consider to be factual, but at the end of the day, I feel it would be unfair to judge this anime as a work with educational value for people like me, because we already know the immune system, the hypothesized/demonstrated workings behind infection and inflammation, the pathogenic mechanisms of virulence, the Bohr effect, haematosis, hypersensitivity, humoral and cellular immunity, glyconeogenesis, we know more or less how it goes, we don't need anyone acting it out in front of us to understand it.\\n\\n\r\nBut there those out there who don't have the slightest clue, and this sure helps some of them to, start understanding how it works at a very basic level, without delving too deep into the details, which isn't necessarily a good thing, you see, now we have people R34'ing platelets because they are small and cute.\\n\\n\r\nTechnical:\\n\\n\r\nThough I have to make it clear, I can't say I'm absolutely disappointed, the fact my personal view of gijinka acting out human physiology doesn't match the one of this show doesn't make it garbage per se, and at the same time I could spend a lot of time rambling on how this doesn't work the way they did it because it's nonsense (like how there's a distinct lack of professional APCs doing some kind of work, it's like they don't care about their function besides the B cell \"using\" antibodies), but I won't.\\n\\n\r\nInstead I'll just say that the enucleation ceremony made me all giddy inside because it was so damn cute but then again I couldn't help but to wonder how the hell did a pathogen get into the bone marrow (and a pseudomonas at that), viruses depicted as fungi was hilarious to see but it's strange how it works, the macrophage depiction was more or less spot on, and while I think the professional phagocytic cell line could use some work, most of them had a very aesthetically pleasant design even if they didn't use half of all their known cytotoxic weapons, the naive Lymphocyte antigen recognition without any background on thymic selection part was awkward I don't think people understood what it meant or what was actually happening, I had a lot of problems wrapping my head around the \"allergic\" immune response, like how does a RBC even carry corticosteroids? they are transported by proteins but the fact it was a robot was a nice touch even if it was overly demonized .. probably, now I didn't like that the neoplastic cell was so plain, they normally can do all sort of things, even replicate the \"abilities\" of other cells.\\n\\n\r\nI can only praise what they did with pulmonary/peripheral circulation, I got to know the names in Japanese without having to look them up, but then I was a bit disappointed that they left the coronary arteries out, it should be priority 1 when exiting the thoraxic aorta, overall, I'd say it was great to see, the use of the imagery was creative and memorable, which I believe is key in explaining haemodynamics, and Mamiko Noto's voice narrating in the background .. 10/10, so props for that (obviously auditive learner here *wink*).\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\\n\r\n\"At least it's not CG\" and unfortunately that's all about I can say, and this is a problem in the sense that, the strong point of this show can only be be its visuals, I can't stress this enough because it already happened to other shows like Inuyashiki, this is where it was meant to go full power and shine, it's all about those looks, the impressions that it will create on people who learn visually, but regrettably I didn't feel especially impressed by anyone in particular (.. except the macrophage .. and only to an extent because of the frills which remind me a lot of the pseudopodia) things I can praise, the RBCs were fairly detailed, you can tell they put a lot of thought in their character design plus the ID tag for adult hemoglobin erythrocyte was a nice touch but still.\\n\\n\r\nRecently the quality of animation has been dropping and being an old timer I can notice when you're skimping on resources, but they did keep the CG to a bare minimum, which is something I can appreciate, I personally wouldn't have minded if this show had been only 15 minutes per episode with the sort of quality we got in Shinryounaika, but that's my personal opinion, other people will look back and say this is the animation they got when they were growing up probably, fighting scenes were awfully simple at times, with still frames and everything, though I have to say bacteria in general were lackluster, I'm guessing it's because the work itself is meant to be about physiology rather than pathophysiology but I'm an infectiologist and this kinda hurts me (.. bacteria can be cute too you know ..), the clot formation was nice but lacking in technical terms because platelet activation was not emphasized enough, and once again, one of the most memorable scenes was the one with the erythrocytes in the right atrium -- very nice and aesthetically pleasant.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I can't say I consider this a very educational show, but I would say that it almost does the job in a way, children will probably look at this and think about how cells are so cute (..and maybe some adults will too), but there's a lot more to it than what you see and at the same time it's more about the entertainment and the visuals than the educational factor (which is the reason why I'm substracting a bit from the final score) but hey, you get to learn new names that you probably didn't know before, and the next time you look at a blood test results, you can finally put a face on each of those names and remember what they do, course things like RDW and MCH are just not gonna make any sense to you so don't expect too much either.",

            "content": "Cells at Work is one of those odd animes that turn out to be much better than you would expect it to be.  This educational anime teaches the viewer all about how your immune system works, by having various cells represented as anime characters going about their day inside of one of the sickest human bodies to ever be born.  Seriously, whoever this is should be dead 10 times over.  \r\nThe premise of the anime is simple: A ditsy red blood cell, creatively named: \"Red Blood Cell\", bumbles around the human body getting lost more often than Roronoa Zoro.  She alwaysbumps into trouble in the form of viruses and bacteria that take the shape of monsters and has to be saved by a White Blood Cell, (also creatively named: \"White Blood Cell\".)   White Blood Cell pretty much makes this anime, as he and his fellow White Blood Cells gorily butcher all viral intruders into this sick person's body.  When they can't handle it, more specialized combatants enter the fray like Macrophage, Killer T Cells and NK Cell, etc... and massive bloody fights ensue.  They aren't amazing fights, as this is an educational comedy and the animation is pretty standard, but there's pretty much one every episode.    \\n\\n\r\nIt's very simple, but very endearing because of the likable characters.  It gets unexpectedly tense at the end, but it's pretty much a light hearted anime. It would almost be a children's anime if not for the wild amounts of gore created by the White Blood Cells.  As a bonus, you'll come away learning more about your immune system than you ever thought.  You'll probably forget about it all within a few months.  But, at least you'll know what a Macrophage does for a while.   \\n\\n\r\nThere's really not much more to it than that.  It's simple, funny, educational and bloody.  Oddly bloody.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoy.  \\n\\n\\n\\n",

Not only because it is totally relatable to me, but in a way how a Japanese animation would handle such story line that takes a long time to perfectly depict in a hyped show, incorporating slice of life elements whilst giving the gift of education.\r\nStory itself is self-explanatory, and so as the characters, and that's what you'd totally expect from it. To be honest, it is not boring--if you totally get the scientifical gist of the show.\r\nThe artof the show is worth mentioning, as it produced by David Productions, the powerhouse that lead to the memefiable JoJo (which by the way would take me a lot of convincing to watch it finally). The utilization of CGI is well-executed that it is barely visible as portrayed.\\n\\n\r\nThe only downside of the show was its choice of music. I have no great deal with its OSTs, however, the pizzazz that will make you at least remember the show fails to do so.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, enjoyment for the show is a plus for me. It's a quick escape from the imagination of our isekai-infused minds and focus on a fantasy story based on real physiological events on our body.",

            "content": "That irony when the anime/manga teaches you about the in-depth analysis on almost every aspect of the human system than what it was being taught on your science class.\r\nIt's weird that the animes of 2018 this year is pack of more weirdness, unique characters and storylines, newer seasons and other overused/misused tropes for the past 10 months. And back on between mid-April to June when IGN, Kotaku and others announced an \"Anime that's all about the blood cells.\"\r\nAt first, on paper, it sounded like a stupid idea to look forward to. But after patiently waiting for this anime to be finished airing, I've decided towatch it to know what's the fuss is all about. And it turns out, I've learnt something besides entertaining myself in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnter \"Hataraku Saibou\" or \"Cells at Work!\" is a David Production anime series that tells the story of our blood cells and how they keep us at being alive and well, 24/7, 365 days a year. And in this 13-episodic series, I really had to consult my trusty google search, wikipedia and other doctrine sites to confirm these kinds of things that I haven't heard on my experience in both Elementary and High School days.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I'm gonna say, I've learnt everything what I could grasp upon just to understand the human anatomy and how do they do it while laughing my a** off to almost cried on the final episode of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nBasically, the plot is just put it into story for the entertainment. But behind of all that is that you are ACTUALLY learning from it and the anime gives you every piece of information about what are those characters are, how they affect the other cells and the internal organs in general, the cause and effect, etc.. It's honestly pretty unique for this type of anime to do this kind of trope. I don't know what are the other animes that serves both as an entertainment and educational in one package, but as a first time watching this anime with that kind of execution is, surprising, not that boring or cringey than what I've watched on TVs, especially western cartoons that tried their best to fuse the two one another and fail miserably to get as many audience as possible.\\n\\n\r\nBut in terms of executing comedy, Red Blood Cell's airhead-ness is always used as the main comedy device for every single episode. Which is kind of hilarious but it kinda worns out to me everytime they show her doing miserably at her work. Fighting sequences, however, is pretty bland. While some can takes for about 30 to a minute while watching mostly White Blood Cell slashing his ways onto defeating the antigens or Killer-T Cells punching their way thru the enemies, it's not that kind of a good one. But, I'm not always looking into that or expecting much of that anyways.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is great. I haven't heard David Production before until I realize they are also known for developing some of the Jojo's series (which I'm not a big fan of), it is not bad.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound in Cells at Work! is pretty much you would expect in this anime. The BGM is full of orchestrated scores consists of tones depending on the execution and how it needs to be represented. And I as what I expected, the scores are pretty much great. The opening and ending songs are also great as well. And Hana Kanazawa's portrayal as RBC and the other VA too are fantastic as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development is almost non-existent until the every end of the anime shows the determination of Red Blood Cell. The other cells however from the other episodes also has a good execution to this one. It honestly, kinds of a bit slow as we all know the anime is purely educational with some plot going on from here to there. But it safe to say that even though we almost didn't see that, we had some of it and the execution of it is not that bad to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nOverall enjoyment, the anthropomorphic cells at Cells at Work! never fails me to give me a 9/10 due to how they've delivered this anime overall. It is surprising to say that this anime really packs a punch when it comes to the information given surrounding from Circulatory, to Respiratory to Digestive System. I'm kinda looking forward to the other Systems that they've did not tackle like the Nervous System, the production system (which is what I'M really looking forward to!) and others. So there you have it, Hataraku Saibou, a surprising example of entertainment and education fuse together and having a positive chemical reaction with a lot of love.\\n\\n\r\n- Does it deserve my attention? Yes.\\n\\n\r\n- Is it recommendable? ABSOLUTELY, especially if you have any friends or relatives who are interested learning about the functions of the system of the human body or those who are doing some research about it or taking a course relate to it.\\n\\n\r\n- Does it need a Season 2? HOPEFULLY! AND I WOULD GLAD TO WATCH IT IN A HEARTBEAT.",

            "content": "Hataraku Saibou is a very enjoyable and educational show that seems to be a bit polarizing, with some people praising or ridiculing the light-hearted and slice-of-life feeling of this 13-episode run. I will admit that I got tired of the show about halfway through the season, and only picked it up a few weeks later as the lack of a contiguous plotline and limits to character development made it hard to binge with so many other great anime out this year. \r\nAs a watcher, I feel that this isn't a show you should binge but rather enjoy periodically.\r\nSPOLIERS:\r\nThere isn't really much of a story inthis anime, and the major development in the show seems to more about the cells themselves rather than the body they're in. There is a lot of screen time given to the main ship in the show between the red and white blood cell, but it doesn't really develop into anything. And sadly, it can't really since they're cells.\\n\\n\r\nWhile there was an attempt to significantly expand the depth of the various blood cell characters in the middle of the season, I feel that it didn't really lead to anything. For example, the entire episode devoted to the childhood rivalry between the Killer T cell and Helper T cell didn't really give us anything other than a few chuckles.\\n\\n\r\nBut there is definitely some really good content here. Hataraku Saibou isn't that serious of a show, and at times seemed to poke fun at anime itself with the fight scenes. I also found the analogies that the show makes to real biology to be very clever. Platelets being lolis carrying coagulation factor and fibrin sheets, white blood cells being patrol officers, red blood cells carrying oxygen and sandwiches on occasion down \"highways\"... it was very creative and fun.",

However its not more than a bit of fun, at least in terms of its story and characters.\r\nCells at work takes places in the human body and every episode there is a new threat, a new evil germ or condition which threatens it, its resolved and we move on to the next one, that is it. Its fun seeing all the bloody fights and the characters themselves are charming and so is this show in general, but there isn'tanything to this narrative. Villains are fun but incredibly one note and super evil, characters don't really get much development, and the story is monster of the week.\\n\\n\r\nI guess the simplicity and repetitive nature comes from the concept, its more about showing cells and science in an imaginative and charming way, whilst still having a good level of accuracy. It does succeed here, but its still very simple and underdeveloped in terms of plot, story and characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and action looks good, there is nothing to complain about here, no shitty CG, the action sequences do look well choreographed.\\n\r\nThe music is something I didn't really notice that much, though I loved the opening and quite liked the ED. The general OST did its job but was rather forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's it..... this is one of my shortest reviews but there just isn't much to say here. Its a rather charming show, its concept is pretty unique it contains a love of biology and is well researched. BUT there is nothing to it, its monster of the week, no plot or character development, its simple, charming, but nothing more than a bit of fun, because its very underdeveloped. I enjoyed my time with this, but due to how shallow and repetitive it is, it only gets a 6 from me.",

            "content": "\"What a nice concept!\", I say. Rather than having a hard time of reading textbooks, encyclopedias and such like that, why not try to watch this anime \" Cells at Work!\" instead?\r\nThe first cell introduced is the Red Blood Cell. Her job is to transport oxygen and nutrients to all parts of the body (well, we all know that) become a delivery girl in the story (sugoii deshou?!). Next is the Neutrophil (a White Blood Cell), that takes  a first move in killing foreign substances (such as bacteria and the like). Platelets are like toddlers... No, they are kawaii toddlers that fix damaged vesselsand the like, and then the rest of the cells were later introduced.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, what's so special about this anime?\\n\\n\r\nEach episode has it's unique situations (more likely, conflicts and problems) dealt by these cells. Cancer cells were also included on the plot and makes you feel touched why they have to be born if they were going to be killed after all. Bacterias are striving to conquer the world... I mean the entire body but eventually slain LMAO. And makes you looking forward for another tragedies to happen (that was negative-- but it doesn't matter at all).\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and art were surprisingly good especially with the badass Neutrophil splatters blood everywhere (I wonder if it is a smaller version of Red Blood Cells). It is satisfactorily good.\\n\\n\r\nThe music has a remarkable opening and ending song that makes you feel like humming while doing other things by that (I swear).\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, It is a masterpiece for me. Even non-anime fans are influenced to watch this anime no matter what just to satisfy their curiosity. And eventually they become one of us (you know what that means). If you already know all the concepts of this field (what I mean is biology field), a graduate or whatsoever, then you must see also how they create a story with a fine plot on it. If not yet, then LEARN HERE! After all, this isn't just for entertainment, it's also LEARNING!\\n\\n\r\nI hope this could be a helpful review.",

            "content": "There is one concept of entertainment that is easily said than done yet it is a very important concept that could bring education or learning process into a better and funner side. That concept is edutaiment. Edutaiment is a concept that merge both education and entertainment in one same media at a purpose to make learning process better and easier to be understood. Hataraku Saibou or Cells at Work! is certainly an anime that successfully bring the concept of edutaiment while keeping the two elements those are education and entertainment on point and with a high standard of accuracy. This made Hataraku Saibou is morespecial than other show in this Summer 2018 season.\\n\\n\r\nYes, the accuracy. One thing I really wanted to praise from Hataraku Saibou is its accuracy on bringing information about cells and how they are working in our body while having those cells anthropomorphized into human men or women. There are so many doctors in YouTube proofed this right by having an explanation side by side while watching the anime. Being a stubborn person I am, I tried to proof myself the accuracy of this anime by asking help from a friend of mine who is currently studying around medical sciences since I am more like an engineering student myself and I am no expert in medical science or biology. \\n\\n\r\nTo keep the eligibility of the answers, I asked her one question first and let her know the connection of my question to the anime right after she finished her answer for that one question. First, I asked her to choose between three cases I took from the anime and she chose the case that took place in last two episodes that is Hemorrhagic Shock. Then I asked her to describe generally about this and she answered,\\n\\n\r\n\"In simple, if there's a wound in body and it is big enough that could cause bleeding, you could bleed in a huge amount of blood. That sudden blood loss would make your body got into a phase called Hemorrhagic Shock. Hemorrhagic Shock came from two different words those are Hemorrhagic for bleeding and Shock for its sudden nature. A huge amount of blood loss in a short time could make your body unstable and this short time instability could lead your body into shock and have many symptoms like fainting.\"\\n\\n\r\nI was a bit shocked by the answer to be honest. When I asked the question, I did not expect every major point that Hataraku Saibou explained would be accurate to my friend's explanation. Hataraku Saibou described that Hemorrhagic Shock happened when the body loses massive amount of blood due to external injuries or internal bleeding and the instability in your body could leads into shock and resulting in fainting. In the anime, this instability is shown by high blood pressure and ended with no red blood cell left to transport the oxygen to whole body. After that, I asked her about how to treat this Hemorrhagic Shock and she answered,\\n\\n\r\n\"Blood transfusion. First, we need to stop the bleeding while transfusing new blood so the blood volume in our body come back to normal.\"\\n\\n\r\nYes! Even the solution for this case alone is so much on point. In Hataraku Saibou, we got to see that the body got blood transfusion hinted by how the new red blood cells look different from the original red blood cell from the body and how the new red blood cell who have very distracting eyebrows told us about their journey before their arrival. With that, I conclude that Hataraku Saibou has a huge accuracy to the real fact and that is a huge kudos to the writer of this anime or even the creator of the source material as they had done their homework to keep this edutaiment anime in a high standard of accuracy.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the story and character, I really love how the story flows and how the characters grow. Our main character, Red Blood Cell, seemed could not stop herself from getting lost which worries Senpai Red Blood Cell and of course White Blood Cell. I love the determination of Red Blood Cell who despite her flaws, she still wanted to move forward and do her job. It really motivates me to do a better work on my real life. My favorite plot of this anime is of course the part involving Cancer cell. I love it since they successfully made me sympathize with the major villain, Cancer cell, without making him too likable. In my opinion, a good story is where you could sympathize with the villain while still wanting to root for the good guys and that is a huge kudos for the writer.\\n\\n\r\nNext, we are going to the animation department. I really love the character design and art style of this anime and I really love the animation of this anime. The animation of this anime worked by the famous studio who works on JoJo's Bizzare Adventure series, David Production. And I admit they really love to brag about working JoJo since even when the drawing style of this anime is different from JoJo, they still managed to slip JoJo references to their art and animation style especially the part where the muscle bounded Effector T-Cell came out. It feels like this studio was already predicted the next thing everyone will said after this scene is \"Holy sh*t, is that a motherf**king JoJo reference?\" and it seemed everyone fall for do the JoJo reference. Aside from JoJo reference, the action sequences are very well animated and this anime has the most beautiful animation for the season next after Hanebado!, so this is a huge kudos for the studio.\\n\\n\r\nBy the way, have you check out that ending for Hataraku Saibou by ClariS? I don't know why but I felt the song is very fit from exhausting day of working and it is perfect to end an anime about cells at work. Yeah, roll credits.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime is a pinnacle of edutaiment concept in anime industry and I think this praise is not coming from me only. There are so many doctors or biologists or experts who praise this anime for its accuracy yet fun representation. With equally great story line, characterization, art style, and animation, this anime surely stood up above any anime in this season as this anime become a breakthrough for the community. Now, I really wish they continue this anime into a second season. Or maybe, they adapted the darker version of the manga that is Hataraku Saibou Black. Both options are still open and I will be waiting for one of them to come.\\n\\n\r\nAnd please, guys. Stop lewding our little platelets. I mean it.",

This is obviously a funny, cute, and kind of childish anime, so don't start watching if you're not into the type. \r\nEnjoyment (9/10)\r\nI'm not sure what age this is for, because on one hand, it's kind of childish and on the other, it has a lot of blood and stuff. ButI don't mind the blood and tolerate childish humor, so I enjoyed this very much!\\n\r\n                   This is good to take a break from serious stuff.\\n\r\nI might watch this in a lot of years from now when I have kids.\\n\\n\r\nThe Story (7/10)\\n\r\nCute anime, with a simple but still a bit thrilling story. The fun is on seeing how they represent actual functions of the body, in a very very good drawing style, and very pleasant animation. Still, it can be a little repetitive, so don't watch this if you're expecting an enormous plot twist that will blow your mind. This is something you can enjoy without much thinking.\\n\r\nI give it a 7 (good) and not a 6 (fair) because the concept is pretty original, in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters: (7/10)\\n\r\nYeah, the characters are really simple and more or less stereotypes, but it's okay, I mean, this is supposed to be fun, and it really gives you a positive vibe. The overall friendliness of the main character will take over!\\n\\n\r\nSound: (9/10)\\n\r\nThe voice acting is flawless, I think, even though I don't really focus on that, and the music is just great, it's appropriate and the Intro and Outro are kind of catchy describe the style of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading this review :)\\n",

            "content": "It\u2019s not the first case of anthropomorphization of our insides and using human body as a setting for story. While the idea is interesting, Hataraku Saibou got much more popularity than I expected. After watching it, I still don\u2019t fully understand reason behind it. No, it\u2019s not bad anime, but it absolutely failed at what I expected from a title using such setting due to two things:\r\n 1. We got a lot of info dumps that should\u2019ve been better integrated into actions instead of having narrator explain everything - I feel that part got better later.\r\n 2. Way too much action. For the most partthis anime felt like Monster of the Week kids show.\\n\\n\r\nDespite those major flaws, I consider it a pretty fun anime, mostly thanks to characters. They are very one-dimensional and simple, but I enjoyed seeing their actions and interactions, even if they were a bit cheesy at times. Their personalities made them very easy to get attached to. And while majority of villains were boring, maniacally cackling nobodies, there still were some nice surprises among them.\\n\r\nCute characters design, colourful art and casual use of blood splatters helped a lot with comedy and gave Hataraku Saibou a light and relaxed feeling. I really appreciate that even in serious moments this series newer got too dark or edgy, keeping the overall nice atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019d also like to praise music in this anime - and to be exact, good usage of background music to add to some scenes. Many series fail at it, or don\u2019t even attempt, which automatically puts Hataraku Saibou at \u201cabove average\u201d level.\\n\\n\r\nOne more thing I need to mention is educational value: there is pretty much none. Please stop. The only thing I learned from this anime are english and japanese names of things I knew from middle school biology. I\u2019m all for learning while having fun, but people try to sell it as something very educative, which is an overstatement.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I\u2019m a bit disappointed, but I don\u2019t regret watching it. It was a fun anime despite its flaws and I\u2019m sure everybody will be happy with a change of pace Hataraku Saibou offers among all the usual settings.\\n\r\nI just wish we got more platelets.\\n\\n",

They make it easy for you to keep track of whats happening even if your not interested in the backstory of how everything works.\r\nThe art is good, its no godlike art style, but its kind of like above middle class.\r\nSound idk the sounds are made.\r\nCharacters are cool, but theytry to add like a love interest thing with some of the main important cells, and tbh it kind of ruins it for someone who wants to learn, but its good for people who do not just watch the history channel for fun.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, I enjoyed it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall would recommend to anyone who likes science, would recommend to anyone taking a science class such as Chemisty/Anatomy/Forensics, would maybe recommend it if you just like learning, and would probably still recommend it even if you vomit at the fact that some crazy anime stuff is happening inside you.",

Doesn't feel boring for each episode.\r\n- Creative world building\r\nCons: \r\n- I know it's not supposed to be extremely realistic, as it is still animation, but some of the diseases presented as enemies are WAY deadlier in real life than are represented in this show.  While tons of people can, and have, survived such things as cancer, hemorrhages, etc.The way they are presented here makes it seem like the body can fight these off without hardly any effort when in fact it doesn't. \\n\r\n- Some other minor inconsistencies (I.E. how is the person all these cells are in not dead by now?  How are all these cells surviving so long? etc.).  \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nThis was fun.  As someone who grew up loving science and loved shows like the Magic School Bus as a kid, this was right down my alley.  Body swapping, and anthropomorphism are two common tropes in entertainment I never get tired of, and seeing Japan take on these kinds of tropes always adds something different and original from what I expect.  If you're like me and enjoy this kind of mildly educational, but fun, stuff, this is the series for you.",

            "content": "Pretty much every edgy insecure young male that watches anime knows Studio David Production from one particular show I don't even think it's worth to mention because it's so overhyped in my opnion, but I learned to get to know Studio David Production's work for the first time with the anime 'Cells At Work!'.\r\nI always was kinda interessed in how your body worked ever since I was a kid, so I wasn't a stranger for the concept. Since we have a Japanese older anime called 'Seimei no Kagaku: Micro Patrol' that I have seen as a kid not even once but twice dubbed on akids channel in my country. Be sure not to get lost while your delivering your oxygen. 1 2 3 4, We Are Cells at Work!\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10 (Very Good)\\n\r\nThis anime is about you. More to be precise your cells in your body. Every cell in this anime are anthropomorphic: From the red blood cells to the cute little platelets the internet all pretty much heartly welcomed. Each has their own job in the body to keep your body alive. 24 hours a day & 365 days a year. In this anime we follow one of the red blood cells named AE3803 (let's call her Red Blood Cell-chan for now), is new on her job and has trouble navigating through the body. A white blood cell, U-1146 (We're going to call him White Blood Cell-kun for now), bumped into Red Blood Cell-chan. He decides to help Red Blood Cell-chan while on duty to stop bacteria and germs that doesn't belong in a healthy body.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the idea of anthropomorphic cells isn't new and been done a lot of times already and even done here in the west, it doesn't mean you can't enjoy this show. This show is probably the best anime created for Summer 2018 and if I think about it even perhaps for the year 2018 in my eyes if I really want to crown Cells at Work! the title \"Anime of 2018\".\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10 (Very Good)\\n\r\nThe artstyle and the animation is very lovely and I really think it does combines very well with the action and humor you will get on your plate. Even though it's very wierd to see blood within blood. How does that even work? Let's classify and file it under as just \"anime physics\"?\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10 (Great)\\n\r\nSame goes for the music: No doubt about it; great. The opening song is very cheerful and I ever since I heard the opening song for the first time, I always felt like wistling along. The voice acting were done great as they really suited the charathers very well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10 (Great)\\n\r\nWith every kind of cell being an character and there being so many different types of cells in your body, there are a ton of characters who make multiple appearances, but it isn't too hard to distinguish the main characters. You have Red Blood Cell-chan, a young girl wich is a redhead who gets lost all the time, White Blood Cell-kun, an odd strange fellow for sure, but he has a secret softy side, the cute little platelets who are perhaps the most adorable characters of this anime and perhaps the main reason why you should check out this anime in the first place since they are voiced by Maria Naganawa (She also voiced Kanna from Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid, mind you). We have Macrophage, a deadly cell who kills cold blooded bateria with a smile, Memory Cell being the treu book worm of the show and the Killer T Cells that fit very wel being portayed. All these characters are really joyfull to see interact with eachother.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10 (Great)\\n\r\nNot only is this anime really charming and the humor gave me some good chuckles, I really liked they also have putted some info about the charathers you will see trough the series. Some people may dislike this, but since I'm a huge science nerd, I really enjoyed it they gave you information trough the episodes. I even learned a new small fact thanks to this show I didn't knew!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10 (Great)\\n\r\nThis is not only a really good anime for anime fans, but I also think this is just a good show for everybody young and old. Even for persons that don't watch anime on a highly basis, I highly recommend to watch this anime if you want to understand the cells in your body a bit more. Maybe just a minor nit-pick that there was only one episode that felt a little off below the normal quality you get to see as the show, but that's maybe just me. Cells At Work! still is in my point of view deserves the title \"anime of 2018\" and is a must-watch! If you still haven't taken care of your body yet, just give this anime a chance. No doubt you'll change your mind.",

            "content": "TL;DR: Risking itself in doing multiple tasks, but it turns out becoming an anime that you can't miss out!!!\r\nI remembered the days I was watching shounen anime and most of them are often really shallow and repetitive, I know someone may disagree with my point of view, but most shounen anime doesn't really impress me much, as main characters are being ignored and they just focus on one or two characters, the storytelling is even most likely omitted, they just focus on one theme then all episodes are all similar, which is really boring to me. I really want to try to find a goodshounen anime, but I can't.\\n\\n\r\nCells at work, on the other hand, is really impressive. It has satisfied me more than I expected. This is not really a typical educational anime, which each episode is the narrator talking about how each cell functions in different circumstances. They're all inserted with different personalities and the varieties of this show has become one of the main features of this anime.\\n\\n\r\n+Many character varieties\\n\r\n+Many story elements (comedy, shounen, passions)\\n\r\n+being educational in an interesting way\\n\\n\r\n-Perhaps some episodes need more explanations \\n\r\n-Due to its varieties, viewers may not enjoy it entirely\\n\\n\r\nGenerally, the characters have many varieties, we have red blood cell, who is acting like clumsy, she seems to be very useless in most situations and requires help from others. White blood cell, which seems to be the one who is very helpful and energetic and able to know clearly how the body works.These are just two examples from the anime and I can already write a few sentences about them. You can see that each character is being organised thoroughly to fit into the personification. You might ask about that will there be any inconsistencies with its educational theme? I can tell you the answer is clearly no. Each character is still referring to their functions according to Biology, they are just being added some flavours to become more interesting to look at and I can say that it's not easy to do that. It's indeed really risky to do two tasks at the same time, but cells at work has nailed it at the end.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, some characters even have a whole episode to talk about their past events, while being educational. For instance, there's an episode about red blood cell and white blood cell being taught by Macrophage, how they face the obstacles and challenges among bacteria. Most shounen anime are unable to do that, they just focus solely on their themes, like Food Wars, which is about Souma cooking dishes and facing obstacles. It's entertaining enough for people who like insane cooking challenges, but what about people who don't? What about for people looking for an interesting story? It's kinda questionable in my opinion (you can refer to my previous review for more details), but cells at work can do so. Each episode has shown enough character personalities and stories, while being educational in a comedic way. It doesn't really solely focus on its educational values, but focus on many other aspects as well, clearly the writers have put many efforts in this anime. Hence, it's more enjoyable in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps in some situations, I think some episodes that Cells at work needs more elaboration, like the episode about fever, the problem hasn't fully solved yet, but it ends up in a rush and moving on to the next disease, maybe because of the episode limit. Also, as it has many varieties to offer, viewers may not enjoy all the elements that this anime offered due to their preferences. However, I think at the end at least you will get something enjoyable apart from its educational values and I think this is a kind of anime that everyone would enjoy watching it.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is in a simple style and it's crafted perfectly to fit into the main theme. Maybe if more colour visuals are used, it'd be more better. Voice actors are great, here we have Hanazawa Kana, voiced as Red Blood cell and platelet voiced by Naganawa Maria, which is the voice actor that has also voiced as Kanna from Dragon Maid and they all fit into the characters well. Sound effects are used in many scenes. The op by characters and the ed by ClariS are also very great to listen as well.\\n\\n\r\nStory:9/10 (S)\\n\r\nAnimation:8.5/10 (A+)\\n\r\nSound:9/10 (S)\\n\r\nCharacter:9/10 (S)\\n\r\nEnjoyment:8.5/10 (A+)\\n\r\nOverall: 8.85/10 (A+)",

            "content": "This show should not be viewed for its story.  It is a personification of our bodies that is brimming with character.  On the surface, Hataraku Saibou is very much a bland edutainment series, but in some moments you can see a lot of humanity.  \r\nOverall, I would recommend this to anyone who is suffering in high school biology class and anyone who is simply looking for a good Killer T(ime). \r\nStory:\r\nHataraku Saibou does not have the most interesting story.  You can easily generalize it with this formula: \r\n1. Everyday life ruined by wound.\r\n2. Red gets scared.\r\n3. New biological problem introduced\r\n4. Whiteand gang fix problem.\\n\r\n5. The end\\n\\n\r\nFor better or for worse, Hataraku Saibou's strength does not lie with it's story, but rather with its characters.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nDavid Productions has down a wonderful job designing the characters of the local inhabitants within us.  It is easy to identify who is what based on their clothing, expression, and physical build.  The world is watercolored and has a friendly atmosphere which nicely contrasts with the rough dystopian-like setting whenever problems occur.  \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe opening music is so catchy.  There is a sense of teamwork and harmony that rides with the upbeat rhythm of song.  While it's OST isn't the most unique or memorable, it does a great job setting the tone.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nAgain, it is easy figuring out who is what based on design and personality.   Small details can reveal a lot of character for some characters.  For example, Red's cowlick can reveal that she is in fact a sickle cell, which explains her clumsy nature.  There is a surprising amount of character development for a edutainment series.  Notable characters include Killer T, Helper T, and Cancer.\\n\\n\r\nWhile trope-y the very characterized personalities really help bring out a sense of a diverse, yet harmonic world.",

            "content": "Biology wasn't my favorite subject in school. Except for the reproduction chapter nothing stook out for me as particulary interesting and the only things I remember from it are some random trivia. I now regret never continuing with that class, because Hataraku Saibou has me interested in my body all over again. Put on your cap and grab your oxygen, this is my review of Hataraku Saibou.  \r\nStory: 9/10\r\nThis anime is about cells in your body. Every cell in this anime is an anime character: From the red blood cells to T-cells. Each has their own job in the body to keepit alive. One of the red blood cells, AE3803 (let's call her red blood cell-chan for now), is a rookie and has trouble navigating through the body. A white blood cell, U-1146 (I hate these names. Now he is white blood cell kun), coincidentally bumps into red blood cell-chan. He decides to help red blood cell-chan with navigating the body while trying to defeate all kinds of bacteria. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the idea of personificating cells isn't new, going this directions is pretty damn creative. It is probably one of my favorite settings in anime so far, even if the world building can get repetetive at times which I will explain later.  \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nThe artstyle and the animation are pretty good.. but nothing that spectacular. The action scenes are most of the times slideshow images which isn't bad, but it feels there was low-effort put into it. It is still really nice to look at it.  \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nSame goes for the music: Pretty good, but nothing noteworthy. The opening is very charming but admittendly not the kind of song that I would put on loop and the ending is great but it isn't ClariS best work.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nWith every kind of cell being an character and there being so many different types of cells in your body, there are a ton of characters who make multiple appearances, but it isn't too hard to find the main characters. You have red blood cell-chan, a cheerful girl who gets lost all the time, white blood cell-kun, a pretty strange fellow but is still enjoyable, the platelets, the most adorable characters of this year and the main reason why you should check out this anime, Macrophage, a deadly cell who kills bacteria with a smile, and Killer T, a very aggresive cell. All these characters are really fun to see interact.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nNot only is this anime really fucking charming and the humor hilarious at times, it also was really informative and I learned a lot about cells, like how cells come to earth and that apparently T-cells exist. Actually, I didn't know the majority of the cells in the anime that they exist. Sadly, the information that you get from this anime is also the biggest downside. It can sometimes feel that they tell you way too much and it can ruin the pace of the anime at times. The anime can also repetetive at times because of its episodic nature. Still, I really enjoyed my time with this anime.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nThis is not only a really good anime for anime fans, but I also think this is just a good show for everybody, even non-anime watchers. This is a good contender for a starter anime and I highly recommend to watch this if you want understand cells in your body more.",

            "content": "Please note this review is intended to be read by those that have finished watching Hataraku Saibou and while care has been taken to minimise story related spoilers there may still be spoilers within character analysis.  You have been warned. \r\nBased off a popular manga of the same name Hataraku Saibou which is also known by its English name Cells At Work is a comedy and shounen genre anime that gives us the rather unique opportunity to see what will happen if the many cells that live within our body were to be given not just the appearances of human beings but also uniquepersonalities of their own and allow us to see the kind of struggles that they go through as they fulfill the various functions that they have been taught within our bodies.\\n\\n\r\nThis idea of converting the many cells that we know exist inside our bodies but we know little about in actuality into humanoids that have differing personalities and allowing us to see the kind of struggles that they put in as they set about the task of managing our bodies day in and day out I felt was an interesting premise as it proved to be not just a fascinating experience but also one that was educational as well due to the knowledge that we gain from seeing how they deal with various situations that happen to the human body. The first episode did an excellent job of not just introducing to us the large and wonderfully designed world of the human body but also in introducing a host of characters that will serve to be great leads as we get to see their struggles as they alongside billions of other cells work hard to keep our body moving. \\n\\n\r\nTaking place deep within the human body that serves as the main stage of the series Hataraku takes place in a large and well-designed town whose various districts form each of the bodies major organs that are linked to each other via countless blood vessels that within the series take the forms of countless long passageways. Each organ within the series in addition to being seen as its own district also has unique themes that are tied to it, for example, the heart the bodies most important organ is seen as a giant shrine while the origin of the cells the Red Bone marrow is seen as a school.\\n\\n\r\nThe overall story that makes use of such a rich setting follows the life of two characters the rookie Red Blood cell a clumsy and na\u00efve cell that has a uncanny ability of always getting lost and running into invading bacteria and germs and the white blood cell her opposite number who while an efficient killer of invaders and germs is actually a soft-spoken and gentle person by nature that while unrecognized and looked down upon by other cells still does his best to protect them from harm. While polar opposites in personalities these two soon strike up a strong friendship and assist each other as they not just go about their jobs of keeping the body running and healthy but also learn to grow and develop as individuals as they confront and overcome one threat after another. Joining them in this unknown war inside us is a host of characters and allies that include the Calm and patient Helper T cell, the proud and boisterous Killer T cell, the quiet but logical Regulatory T cell, the brave but lonely Eosinophil, and the gentle and cheerful Macrophage. Together these cells while varying greatly in temperament and motivation must learn to work together as they protect not just their homes but also us from a wide range of wacky germs and bacteria that seek to break into our body and cause havoc.   \\n\\n\r\nU-1146 \\n\\n\r\nU1146 voiced by veteran voice actor Tomoaki Maeno of Kiznaiver and Log Horizon fame is one of the main characters of the series and one of Red Blood Cells friends within the series. Better known as White blood cell within the series it can be seen that white blood cell is a stoic, hardworking and dependable person that while acknowledging the views that other cells have for him and his kin still approaches his assigned role with motivation and tenacity. While very loyal to his job as one of the bodies foremost defenders it can be seen that white blood cell while intelligent can also be somewhat slow to react to new changes in the situation which is seen in a number of scenarios where the germs and bacteria gain the advantage due to their unorthodox tactics. While seemingly brooding and not one for small talk it can be seen that this is but merely his surface personality as beneath this it can be seen that White blood cell is someone that is surprisingly kind and caring to others and can be quite honest with his own opinions. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, while honest it can be seen that White blood cell is also someone that can be overly harsh on himself at times shown when he blames himself for not reacting fast enough to a crisis or to save an innocent cell from harm. However, rather than letting this cause doubt within him this instead has the opposite effect as it serves to provide White blood cell with the extra motivation that he needs to fulfill his duties and protect his fellow cells better. \\n\\n\r\nAE3803 \\n\\n\r\nAE3803 voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Kana Hanazawa of Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei and Infinite Stratos fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. A rookie Red blood cell that had just started on the job some weeks ago from the onset it can be seen that Red blood cell was someone that was earnest, hardworking and cheerful and was someone that tried to do the best that she can in the roles that she had been assigned to. However, within the series, this is offset by her clumsy and ditsy nature and her seemingly uncanny ability of being able to get lost on the most simple of routes. An ability that also had the unfortunate effect of leading her to locations where germs and bacteria would arise from too often hilarious results. However, despite her seemingly series of misfortunes, it can be seen that Red blood cell is someone that really loves her job and similar to her counterpart White blood cell see\u2019s it as an important duty. As a result of this and also because of her friendly nature it\u2019s perhaps unsurprising that Red blood cell not only managed to forge a strong friendship with White blood cell that not only allowed both to make their first friends but also allow each to find strength from seeing each other\u2019s actions and develop into better cells that are more effective at their roles than their pasts selves. \\n\\n\r\nWhile ditsy, clumsy and evidently someone that had a poor sense of direction at the beginning of the series as the series goes on this begins to change. While very loyal to her job as the series goes on and Red Blood cell realizes just how vital her role as a RC cell is to the body she gradually realizes that getting scared of every little thing isn\u2019t just lowering her efficiently but also that of the countless other cells that work alongside her as well and as a result not only becomes braver but also willing to improve herself by both learning her routes and trying to do tasks herself a development that I felt was a welcome one and one that showed just much she had learned from seeing how hard the other cells were working. \\n\\n\r\nHelper T cell \\n\\n\r\nHelper T cell voiced by veteran voice actor Takahiro Sakurai of Food Wars and Grancrest fame is one of the main support characters of the series and is one of Red Blood and White Blood cells allies within the series. A member of the T cells subtype of white blood cells Helper T cell from the onset can be seen to be someone akin to a general that\u2019s commanding a frontline not just in terms of attitude but also in terms of regalia and station as he commands the defense from a space that can be seen to be a close match to a military command center. A calm composed and intelligent person by nature Helper T cell as benefiting someone that\u2019s akin to a general is someone that\u2019s patient, perceptive and fast thinking and can be seen to be someone that\u2019s capable of seeing the larger picture. Unlike his subordinate killer T cell Helper T cell is someone that is seen to value not just teamwork but also efficiently as well and as a result, can be seen to have a rather turbulent but also amusing relationship with him something that I feel was quite funny considering the differing personalities that they have. While a logical and sometimes cold person by nature Helper T cell is undoubtedly one of the bodies most vital cells in their endless fight against the bacteria and the germ.  \\n\\n\r\nKiller T cell\\n\\n\r\nKiller T cell voiced by veteran voice actor Daisuke Ono of Durarara and Attack on Titan fame is one of the main support characters of the series and is one of Red Blood cell and White Blood cells allies within the series. A member of the T cells subtype of white blood cells like his superior Helper T cell Killer T cell from the onset can be seen to be someone that\u2019s loud, confident and proud of his status of being a part of the elite anti bacteria division. As a result of this Killer T cell is someone that can be quite intimidating to others and inadvertently causing most cells to view all white blood cells as psycho\u2019s that are obsessed with strength and thus cells to avoid. As a result of this personality, it's perhaps unsurprising that Killer T cell is someone that\u2019s quick to anger and doesn\u2019t like asking others for help even if the situation is outside of his ability to deal with. Indeed, it can be seen that unlike the majority of other cells Killer T cell is someone that seems to view friendships with disdain. \\n\\n\r\nDespite his intimidating and loud nature, it can be seen that Killer T cell is someone that\u2019s dutiful, responsible and is very proud of his job and surprisingly is someone that can respect those that have a strong motivation to fight and willing to offer them help and advice when needed. While certainly loud and brash Killer T cell I thought was the type of cell that they needed to act as the backbone of the frontline. \\n\\n\r\nRegulatory T cell \\n\\n\r\nRegulatory T cell voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Saori Hayami of Owari no seraph and Darling in the Franxx fame is one of the main support characters of the series and is an important ally to White Blood Cell and Red Blood cell. A member of the T cells subtype of white Blood cells Regulatory T cell from the onset can be seen to be a calm, composed and quiet person that performs her role within the series with both professional grace and effortless efficiently something that stands her in good stead as the second in command to her superior Helper T cell. While professional and calm Regulatory T cell is also someone that\u2019s patient and perceptive easily able to determine the main roots of a problem and suggest countermeasures to her superior. Ironically despite being the second in command of the defense effort, she has her hands full with keeping the likes of killer T cell and Helper T cell from taking each other on a role that will no doubt give others a headache. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEosinophil \\n\\n\r\nEosinophil voiced by veteran seiyuu Mao Ichimichi of Digimon Tri and Youkoso fame is one of the main support characters of the series and is one of White Blood cell and Red Blood cell\u2019s allies within the series. A type of white blood cell Eosinophil from the onset is shown to be someone that\u2019s brave, tenacious but also quiet. While the great majority of white blood cells within the series are shown to be looked down upon it can be seen that this has had a much larger effect on her as it ensured that she had few if any friends and thus making her both lonely and quiet and ensuring that she has very low self-esteem. While acknowledging her lack of strength when compared to other immune cells like Macrophage and being especially sensitive to being called weak by others it can be seen that Eosinophil is still someone that will work hard to protect her fellow cells and willing to step up to face dangerous threats no matter the odds arrayed against her. This shows not just her responsible nature but also how dedicated she is to her job even if others view her with nothing but disdain. \\n\\n\r\nWhile originally someone that had very low self-esteem that\u2019s seems out of place for an immune cell Eosinophil\u2019s gradual overcoming of her fears within the series and in the process winning the respect of her fellow cells I felt was done well within the series and showed that sometimes the strongest cells are those that are able to step up at the right moment and do their assigned role without fear. \\n\\n\r\nMacrophage \\n\\n\r\nMacrophage voiced by veteran seiyuu Kikuko Inoue of Fullmetal alchemist Brotherhood and Rosario to Vampire fame is one of the main support characters of the series and is one of White Blood cell and Red Blood cell\u2019s allies within the series. A type of white blood cell Macrophage from the onset can be seen to be someone that is calm, positive, kind and gentle and is someone that\u2019s more in line with a mother figure than anything else. An intelligent, fast thinking, cheerful and perceptive person by nature Macrophage is someone that evidently loves her job as while allowing her to take down evil invading germs and bacteria also allows her to interact with and help raise new cells into their assigned roles. As a result of this varied skill set and unique personality, it can be seen that Macrophage not only has the respect of her fellow cells but also the utter fear and despair that the many bacteria and germs have for her something that is quite surprising for a single cell. \\n\\n\r\nThe character of Macrophage I felt was quite the interesting one that was helped by not just her versatility but also of the fact that her unique mannerisms only served to highlight that while graceful and beautiful she was also someone that was capable of wrecking great havoc on any invaders with her prized hatchet that takes advantage of her impressive strength. Seeing an assassin also take up the role as a cleaner and childcare worker I felt was quite intriguing.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nAMV \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation, I felt that the character designs for the series characters were pretty well designed and animated within the series. Each of the characters within the series which within the context of the story are types of cells that were given human form I felt while unique in appearance also matched well with the duties that they play within the body via their unique quirks like for example the red and white outfits that are worn by Red and White blood cells who deliver oxygen and handle intruders, the office like attire of Regulatory T cell who deals with trouble between cells and the military like outfit worn by Helper T cell. The character design for Macrophage in particular I felt was quite unique as it gave not only a unique appearance to her, but it was also one that matched well with the fact that she was a hybrid cleaner and assassin in function as well. In terms of locations I felt that the series did a really good job of transforming the inside of the body into something that most humans would recognize which is a town and I felt that it also featured quite a variety of terrain that not only gave each section of the body a unique theme but also in a way that made sense to the viewers. The combat animations within the series of which there were many I felt was pretty well done that was helped greatly by both the fluidity of the animations but also by the creative depiction of the many types of germs and bacteria that the immune cells must deal with every day.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMusic wise I felt that the series OST did an excellent job of providing good background music to the many scenes within the series being calm and peaceful when everything is going well and dramatic and tense when things go south. The series made use of one opening and ending theme which was Mission Ken Kou Dai Ichi which was sung by Kana Hanazawa, Tomoaki Maeno, Daisuke Ono and Kikuko Inoue who voiced the characters of Red Blood Cell, White Blood Cell, Killer T and Macrophage respectively and CheerS which was sung by ClariS. While the opening theme had the positive and cheerful tone that gave the feeling that it will be another cheerful day at work the ending theme gave the impression that it was thanking us for our hard work. Both of these themes I felt matched well with the series main subject of cells defending us day in and day out from evil bacteria and germ and a war that we didn\u2019t know existed within us.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of voice acting, I felt that the voice cast of the series did an excellent job of portraying their assigned characters whether they were main ones or supporting ones. In particular I felt that Kana Hanazawa, Tomoaki Maeno, Takahiro Sakurai, Daisuke Ono, Saori Hayami, Mao Ichimichi and Kikuko Inoue who portrayed the characters of Red Blood cell, White blood cell, Helper T cell, Killer T cell, Regulatory T cell, Eosinophil and Macrophage respectively all did an excellent job portraying their assigned characters. In addition, while I didn\u2019t cover them I also felt that Maria Naganawa and Aya Endou who portrayed the important characters of the adorable platelet and the ever-helpful Sempai Red Blood cell also did a great job portraying their respective characters. While she doesn\u2019t have a character of her own within the series I felt that the series narrator veteran seiyuu Mamiko Noto also did an excellent job of not just introducing us to the various organs within the body but also in explaining the functions that the various cells, bacteria and germs have in an easy to understand manner. This I felt was helped greatly by Mamiko Noto\u2019s prided calm voice. \\n\\n\r\nOverall conclusion \\n\\n\r\nOverall Hataraku Saibou I felt was quite the fascinating anime that had among its strong points a unique premise, entertaining story, well-designed characters, excellent voice acting, creative character and enemy designs and well-designed combat scenes. \\n\\n\r\nThe first thing that comes to mind when looking at what Hataraku Saibou is that unlike most animes this season it feels less of anime but more like an educational program that aims to teach its audience about the various cells that exist within the body and how they each contribute in helping to protect us from the many bacteria and germs that we encounter each day. In an anime season in which we have seen samurai heroes, vampires disguised as coffee makers and demon lords that are more cute than threatening such a fresh change of subject and premise I felt was not just surprising but also incredibly refreshing as well. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall premise of the series is naturally the unseen war that rages beneath our very skin and one that pits the bodies countless cells against the countless invading bacteria and germs that enter the body every minute of the day. This premise I felt was quite interesting as until now very few animes feature the human body as its main setting and as a result being able to see inside a world that we humans seldom get to see and understand unless of course you\u2019re a doctor was something that was fascinating to me. This premise was helped greatly by the fact that each of the cells that live within the body were not just given unique appearances but also in the fact that the series takes great pains to ensure that each cells function within the series is accurate and explained in a easy to understand manner and thus matching well with the premise that this anime\u2019s main purpose rather than show how cool cells are which they are is to educate the viewers on how they work together inside us to protect our bodies from harm.  \\n\\n\r\nThe overall story of the series I felt made great use of the series premise by not just showcasing the unique characteristics and personality of each cell but also of the duties that are unique to them by making use of a great variety of bacteria and germs that invade the body. While the series made use of the common villain of the week formula that we so often see in both animes and tv shows the series also took great care to make these relevant to the series premise by not just introducing us to the nature of the germs and bacteria that invade the body in an episode but also of the overall threat that they pose to the body. This way of both showing us the immediate short-term threat and the effects that it has on the larger picture I felt was well done and helped greatly by the large variety of illnesses that the studio managed to squeeze in. \\n\\n\r\nAdditionally I also felt that the series did an excellent job at showing the kind of decision making that the cells make as they deal with major decisions and I felt it was nice that we got to see not just what the overall strategists like helper T cell would do but also how the frontline immune cells like White blood cell, Macrophage and Killer T cell would react when sudden threats that are different to what they encounter in their daily activities erupt suddenly. This aspect I felt served to remind people that the defense of the body is a job that\u2019s fulfilled by countless cells that all work together for one purpose which I felt matched well with the series main purpose. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Hataraku Saibou was an anime that I really enjoyed and was definitely one of the best animes this season and was one that was not just entertaining but also educational as well. As a final score I would say that Hataraku Saibou easily deserves a final score of 10/10. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

There\u2019s also some sort of story, as this show follows daily lives of a few cells (cells are represented as humans, while human body itself is represented as aworld). And then we have viruses and bacteria which have shape of monsters or something that looks like some sort of Pok\u00e9mon on crack. \\n\\n\r\nMaybe it\u2019s the feeling of nostalgia or simply curiosity that made me start watching this\u2026 Either way I don\u2019t regret it, as I find this show really enjoyable. \\n",

Unlike most mainstream anime that follows an overpowered character without any real character development which is then followed by predictable outcomes to every problem/obstacle, the character might come across (Dragon Ball series). Hataraku Saibou is a simple anime with a simple plot but it does it so well that it creates a masterpiece, without the need of overpowered characters and unnecessary characters to make the main protagonist seem even more powerful in comparison. All itpresents are characters that have their flaws but analogize it with every character no matter how small their roles are, there is a reason behind it.\\n\\n\r\nI can truly say this is one of a kind anime, who would've thought an anime about what goes on inside the human body will actually be good. The art and animation fit story perfectly, the characters have the personalities you would expect and overall the feeling the anime presents is wonderful.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, sorry I'm not much of a writer but I highly recommend watching this anime you won't be disappointed!",

            "content": "Cells at Work (Hataraku Saibou) is a solidly entertaining summer TV series.\r\nIt is often touted as the Japanese answer to Osmosis Jones and Once Upon a Time...Life, and both comparisons are accurate.\r\nAlthough it is an educational series at heart, Cells at Work is also quite entertaining. It functions as a battle shounen sprinkled with facts about the human body and a dash of characterization here and there.\r\nThe main character is a ditzy but well-meaning Red Blood Cell, and her counterpart is the stoic, germ-slaying White Blood Cell. Their interactions are surprisingly compelling for two anthropomorphized cells, and the extended cast of characters is also good.\r\nTheJojo-esuqe Killer T Cells and the adorable Platelets are the most memorable supporting characters so far, but many of the additional cells are given a chance to shine over the course of the series. \\n\\n\r\nEach episode has featured a new enemy in a \"monster of the week\" format, and new cells or bodily systems have been concurrently introduced.\\n\\n\r\nThe episodic nature has worked well so far, although a sinister enemy introduced this week (episode 6) could end up being the big bad for several episodes.\\n\\n\r\nTo summarize, Cells at Work is an entertaining anime. Its audience is primarily students and teens, but the show's cast of characters is varied and endearing enough to appeal to a broader group of fans. You don't have to be a biology expert to enjoy this fun, action-filled, and occasionally dark summer anime.\\n\\n\r\nRatings: \\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10. No over-arching plot, but the developing cancer cell subplot is quite interesting.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10. Colorful, good action scenes, distinct and unique character designs.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10. Good sound effects and soundtrack. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10. A fun cast filled with Jojo references, moe characters, and a cute MC.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10. Light summer fare that actually teaches you something.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.5/10. Nothing groundbreaking, but it is an entertaining battle shounen with a unique setting and memorable characters.",

            "content": "Before you say this anime doesn't deserve a 10, shut up, this is a preliminary review, let me have this pls.\r\nBest way I can describe this beautiful anime is Inside Out meets One Punch Man, which to me instantly spells jackpot.\r\nYou see, there's two things in this world I adore. The first one is anthropomorphic animals/objects/things. The second one is Biology jokes and references or Science jokes in general. This show covers both.\r\nFrom the cute concave hat of Erythrocytes to the \"KILL\" spelling hats of CTLs (Literally called Killer T Cells), the attention to detail is astonishing. That's basically the main reason I love thisshow so much. It's like it was tailored made for Science geeks.\\n\r\nLet me put it like this; I firmly believe this is an anime you could show your college professors and NOT feel embarrased about. That's super rare.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is pretty good, the story is unique aswell, and the musical score is on point, but what's most important is that this show is flooded in creativity, well executed creativity. At the end of the day that's what matters the most, at least for a comedy in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nNo one wants to hear a joke they've been told a thousand times already, that's exactly why this anime works, because where else can you find something like this?\\n\r\nThe closest thing I can think of is those old Biology cartoons they used to show us in school. In a way this is exactly that, but more complex.\\n\\n\r\nIt's as if those elementary school cartoons somehow got adapted to the level many of us are currently at, which feels refreshing. As if they had grown with us.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally I wouldn't use the show as a teaching tool though. Jokes hit much better when you already understand what they're about.\\n\\n\r\nThat's not to say the general public should be discouraged from watching it. I think what you need in order to understand this show is AT MOST a highschool diploma, which most people here already have, so if you have the time, definitely give it a watch.",

            "content": "Hataraku Saibou or Cells at Work is an educational anime which is actually a bit surprising given the amount of gore involved.\r\nThere isnt too much of a story to it, each episode is generally episodic where most of what happens in prior episodes doesnt matter. Each episode explains how things works in the body and has the body's cells protect it from germs, viruses ect. For the most part it revolves around a Red blood cell that often gets lost trying to do her job and is a magnet for germs'viruses and a white blood cell that tends to always appear at the nick oftime and massacres germs. What little story there is revolves around the interaction between the two and stopping the Villain of the episode. There might be one or two two part episodes in the short series.\\n\\n\r\nArt work is nicely done. It doesnt blow you out of the water but it looks good and I cant say I noticed any parts where the quality dropped like in other anime when they tend to show characters at a distance. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter wise there is a some development and the characters are likeable. They feel like real people with personalities even if it is not to a deep extend.  I found it enjoyable as a short anime. I wouldnt go as far as recommending it but if you are looking for something to watch it might be worth adding this to your list.",

            "content": "You know what this show reminds me of? Saturday Morning cartoons. Completely cheesy, sometimes nonsensical writing. Animation that definitely cuts corners sometimes. Heavy handed lessons. And yet, I enjoyed it very much.\r\nI have actually been reading the manga before getting into the anime, and honestly i prefer the manga. The pacing in the manga just flows better, and the art looks better too. I was slightly disappointed in how much the anime relied on recycled shots and still images. The manga has the educational bubbles that you can read if you want to get an understanding of the biological basis, which I found to beinformative while not too intrusive. In the anime, however, the entire story pauses while a narrator reads this bubble, which often wrecks the pacing. I feel the show would have served better to let the narrative point to the science without stopping to fully define all the terms.\\n\\n\r\nThe plots and villains of each episode vary from intriguing to old school dumb, like the fact that every villain monologues and is evil for the sake of being evil. Occasionally, the show provides an intriguing narrative and antagonist, such as the episode that deals with cancer cells. The tropes and narrative conveniences reminded me very much of Saturday Morning Cartoons, and despite my criticisms, I often had a smile on my face and felt vaguely nostalgic.\\n\\n\r\nOne bright spot in the production in my opinion was the soundtrack. The orchestral music was lush, but also often playful. It may have not have always been used in quite the right moment  narratively, but the music itself was well made. Also, the use of traditional Japanese drums to represent the heartbeat was I think a brilliant move. It got my heart pumping!\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, the show isn't really that amazing, but it is fun!",

            "content": "Summer 2018 is undeniably one heck of a ride with all of the most hyped and anticipated anime be it sequels or original adaptions but there is one particular unique anime that stands out from the rest of the titles and that is Cells at Work! or also known as Hataraku no Saibou. Japan never fails us in providing us anime that contain personifications of inanimated objects or living things like Houseki no Kuni (anime about gems) and Kemono friends (anime about wild animals) and both of them were breaths of fresh air in the modern anime industry and Cells at Work is no execption.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY : (7)\\n\\n\r\nthe rest of the plot takes place in a personified human body where billions of trillions of anthropomorphic cells are living there, working all day without taking a break at all just like our real life body cells. it also focuses on two main characters, the red blood cell who always get lost whenever she goes and a relentless white blood cell who always gets his job done fighting invading pathogens.  to be specific there is almost no plot in the entire episodes each of the episodes tells a single story about each of the cells specific functions and what they contribute to the human body. there are some laughs here and there but the most crucial is how the narrator explains the functions of the cells whenever they make their first appearance to the point that it already becomes an educational tool for those who dont have any background in biology which is a good thing indeed as a lot of anime nowadays are lacking it. \\n\\n\r\nART : (8)\\n\\n\r\nthe series was made by a studio that Jojo fans are familiarized with, David Production. While most of their works are not really that groundbreaking, the visuals in this anime is actually decent. i really love how bright the settings are not to mention the graphical expressions of the characters as they interact with each other. Unfortunately, the background settings are not really that great. its average at best with all of the dull looking buildings which can be an eyesore to some people. one thing that i want to praise is how accurate they designed the pathogens. for instance, the bacterium actually do have those tentacles-like parts which are something that are attached to real life bacterium. with all of these amazing details and how each of the anthropomorphic cells look very different from each other, the studio did their best. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND : (8)\\n\r\nim going to start with the opening and ending songs. for starters, the OP song is quite catchy to listened to although some people may actually dont like it that much. What amazed me is that the seiyuus are actually the ones who sang the song. as for the ending, i feel like it is charimastic and relaxing in the sense of like after all of the chaotic moments in a particular episode (yeah im not kidding) and this song plays, it will put a smile in your face. and most crucially, the voice actors notably the famous Kana Hanazawa who played the role of Erythrocyte chan she really did an absolutely splendid job heck some people solely watched cells at work just because she played a role of the main character it shows how many people adored her voice although she appeared in dozens of anime that it some people got bored with it. the other seiyuus also performed a great job potraying each of the characters professionally. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER : (9) \\n\\n\r\nif there is one thing that im going to praise a lot,it would be the cast of the cells mainly Miss Red Blood Cell chan. Kana Hanazawa is perhaps the best seiyuu which fits her clumsiness and overreactions most of the times. Some might found our cute RBC quite a bit annoying with her trademark of being lost in almost every episode but that is how she is. Mr White Blood Cell on the other hand, is the complete opposite of her. Being one of the few blood cells in the human body's immune system to annihilate any invading pathogens. He can be quite serious and ruthless most of the times but from the inside, he's actually kind hearted always protecting RBC from the shadows. Other than that, probably the most lovable character by the fandom is of course adorable little Platelet chan,another important cell which helps to coagulate wounds. although her appearance is not that frequent but whenever she did, it always sent smiles to our faces. Of course there are other great characters as well i can gurarentee that you will find them likeable. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : (9)\\n\\n\r\nLike i said earlier at the begining of the review, this anime is a breath of fresh air that not only it serves as a form of entertainment but at the same time viewers can also learn a bit of two about the characteristics and functions of the cells which these anthropomorphic cells professionally displayed in the show. Unfortunately, the pace can get a bit repetitive in nature due to the fact that almost every episode begins with pathogens invading the body, a new cell is introduced to destroy them and the end. there are however some episodes that change the pace which makes it less daunting to watch especially the last episode which in my opinion is very dark and gritty. but overall Hataraku no Saibou is a fantastic anime which even non anime fans will find it enjoyable. if you dont have anything to watch and looking for something fresh and new also if you are passionate in biology just like i am, then this show is worth the watch!\\n\\n\r\nOverall : (8.6)\\n\\n",

However, midway through the show, there are glaring issues with the anime that become really apparent that ruins the entire experience. \r\nCharacters: \r\nThe cells in the show are depicted as humans which their attire and personality derived based on whatthe cells do. Killer T and white blood cells(wbc) are arrogant killing machines, killer T being more arrogant wheras wbc are more endearing with the red blood cells(rbc). Platelets are extremely adorable but why are they depicted as kids? Subsequently, the \"plain\" cells and rest of rbc are assholes who go beyond what backdrop characters do. An example of this is at Ep 4 which sees the introduction of kousankyuu which, according to the show, kills parasites. The ep starts of with kousankyuu protecting a rbc from germ but failed to kill it since thats not her specialty. The other rbc and \"plain\" cells are at the  back shittalking about her inability. You cant help but go \"why?\" at that scene as that was literally someone risking their life to protect another but to be looked down due to her inability. Though the ep ends with her redemption, you cant help but feel that kousankyuu should have let those who looked down on her in the first place to die.\\n\\n\r\nSpecific examples aside, one glaring issue for me was the use of CG in the show. The rest of the rbc who are travelling along 3803 are obviously CGs but they are done so poorly that they appear to be moonwalking forward while pushing their carts. Also there will be specific scenes where you can see several of the background rbc having identical movement.\\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\r\nIm gonna skip out commenting on how the character designs and environment are indicative of what they are suppose to represent since 1) im shit at biology, 2) Im not an art expert. However, i will say there are several scenes where the art is extremely lazy which makes it particularly disappointing considering how much hype this show's gotten (Ep7 21:40, 3803's head is scaled disproportionate to how she is in the immediate next frame 21:45\"s still image.)\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nIt borders between slice of life and educational, however, there are world building concepts that seem to fall apart if you think about them for more that 3 seconds. Ep 3 ending shows that the platelets have created a net to close up an abrasion wound and the ep ends with 3803 and 1146 being stuck to the sticky net along with other cells to create a scab. I never took biology as a subject so i could be wrong but isnt a scab something that falls off as \"dried blood\" when the wound has recovered? Platelet mentioned this at the end of the ep which based on that would mean that 3803 and 1146 will be expelled out of the body when the wound is closed up. Might be nitpicky but this small things kinda ruins the viewing experience. Again, i could be entirely wrong and even if im right, the issue can be fault on its source material, the manga.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: \\n\r\nI came to this show excited, with all the fan art about the characters and how adorable platelet is in those small clips you see on the internet. However, beyond the cute character designs, hataraku saibo is plagued with multiple issues that stops it from being a classic. The issues i've highlighted are minor and probably nitpicky but are things that can be ratified if the team behind it put just a bit more effort and attention to detail to make it better. At the end of the day, it boils down to a neat concept that has gone to waste due to the accumulation of minor faults.",

            "content": "Hataraku Saibou or Cells at work is the best anime which unfortunately underrated in otaku/anime community. \r\nThe release time pf this anime, when gems shows/seasons airing was also affect its rating and ranking as well. \r\nThis anime have different story which base on how human body work with Anime twist.\r\nThis anime is not only for nerds and geeks as many people qouted,in fact everybody can watch and understand about human cells and thier working with amazing anime twists.\r\nThis show is definitely a gem of this season because it focus on something we thought of boring as hell and make that very interesting to watch.\r\nWhy iliked?\\n\r\nWell for starter this show based on human body cell, how they are different, what kind of work they are perform etc. Basically it is all about human internal function. So it should be booring when i first checked it out. But when i started watching this show. I instantly\u00a0 fall for it, the very first episode i watch, i suck into that world and i just love how autor/director/team portrait this booring theme to very interesting way.\\n\r\nThey include various ups and downs, how hard our body work for survive.\\n\r\nHow they cell deliver, fight and protect which make this series worth to watch for entertainment and knowledge purpose also.\\n\r\nAlso they use little notes throughout series which help us to understand which cell is working what in body. So it is easier to understand story and background of characters\\n\r\nLets talk about art style, art style is between good to very good but i assure you that it will not affect the fun you have while watching this series.\\n\r\nStory i already discribed in short with my personal rating of 10.\\n\r\nMusic is also good and voice actors gave there maximum for their character to live on screen. \\n\\n\r\nWhy i disliked? \\n\\n\r\nBasically i have nothing to point out bad in this series. But few things i noticed which shold improve further. \\n\r\nFirst of all there are many outside interferences both positive and negative to our bodies. There are very less positive interferences shown in this show. \\n\r\nWe take many medicines in our life and they should be appear in anime as well but anime creators skip it. \\n\r\nMore fight sequence may be increase the curiosity of viewers. \\n\r\nArt styles can more in depth. \\n\\n\r\nConclusions\\n\r\nThis show is must watch in my opinion. You can learn and enjoy at same time after watching this show. Story and enjoyment is 10 out of 10. My personal overall rating is 9 out of 10 for this anime show.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal points. \\n\r\nYou need dictionary sometime and consult professional to under stand events if you want in dept knowledge about events in series.",

            "content": "This is my first review. May contains spoiler.\r\nInitially, I think this anime has a unique premise. It must be great. It's not, but enjoyable enough.\r\nStory 5/10:\r\nThis is basically an educational anime about blood cells in our body. However, while it is mostly accurate, some of them is not. For example:\r\n1. How can erythrocyte and eosinophil meet again?\r\n2. Why does erythrocyte carry nutrient?\r\n3. Anisakis is too powerful.\r\nAnother one is that when it is true in the real body, it makes no sense in the story, like:\r\n1. Lack of red blood cell causes winter? (Because heat travels via blood by convection better than via cells by conduction,since there is no blood fluid here, this reason cannot be used for this anime)\\n\r\n2. Where do medicine, transfusion fluid, and other blood cells come from? (By going to the doctor and get a recipe for medicine and transfusion, but nowhere are we given the reason why in this anime) This is the classic example of deus ex machina.\\n\r\n3. How can transfusion fluid save the day? (In this anime's setting, it will either causes a flood or not enough to combat dehydration)\\n\r\n4. Why is the hassle of training a white blood cell when it will just be helper T cells? (Helper T cells don't fight here, although the test will be very important in the real body)\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10:\\n\r\nGood but generic. Nothing to comment.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10:\\n\r\nI can't comment about the sound, but the OP is great.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 6/10:\\n\r\nGeneric character, with cells with the same type have similar personality. The only exception is erythrocytes and (to an extent) eosinophil. Macrophages would be great if it is just for one cell instead of entire macrophages. Also, the cancer cell is good.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10:\\n\r\nDespite that, this anime manages to attract my interest for its funny moments (although too few for a comedy), heartwarming moment, and one great arc (cancer arc).\\n\\n\r\nOverall 6.6/10.\\n\r\nIf you have time to waste, I recommended watching this anime. However, be sure to double check everything that comes from this anime. Also if your anime taste is refined (as I am not), you may dislike this anime.",

            "content": "Osmosis Clones: An Unserious Review\r\nThere are plenty of unusual demographics in anime. There are mecha fans, hopeless romantics, hentai addicts, so on and so forth. Cells At Work tailors to a very specific demographic indeed: the shounen-fan-medical-student.\r\nCells At Work tries its hand at fusing comedy with shounen tropes. Although neither of these do anything outstanding, they gel together well. The comedy is enough to make you smile without breaking your ribs, and the fight scenes are typical bloodfests. But the real quirk here is the science behind it all. It\u2019s easy to see that the writers have done serious research into the field. The anthropomorphisedbiological accuracy is enough to make a pathologist squeal in delight. Proper cell names are used, entire episodes are based around physiological conditions, and the presentation grabs the attention of viewers who couldn\u2019t give two dendrites about biology.\\n\\n\r\nAs clever as the underlying facts are, they can obstruct the narrative from time to time. Whenever something new and interesting happens, the action will freeze to make time for an explanation of what this cell is, and why it\u2019s doing what it\u2019s doing. Call me a purist, but I\u2019d rather not have my epic shounen fights paused so that Lovely Narrator Lady can explain why Staphylococcus Aureus is a nasty pathogen. \u201cShow-don\u2019t-tell\u201d is a staple of good storytelling \u2013 one that Cells At Work sometimes forgets. Even then, the narrative doesn\u2019t have mush to boast about anyway. It\u2019s heavily serialised with minimal continuity and frequent flashbacks. While not necessarily bad, there are a few missed opportunities for decent character arcs.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of characters, they\u2019re the real heart (haha) of the show. Our cellular main characters Red Blood Cell and Neutrophil (White Blood Cell) make for some entertaining viewing. Neutrophil is the classic badass soldier with a heart of gold, while Red Cell is made entirely of sugar, haemoglobin, and waifu material. I do wish Red Cell were a little less ditsy, and that Neutrophil didn\u2019t have to run to her rescue every other episode, but the chemistry (enough of these puns) between these two is enough to make up for it. This show\u2019s characters, both main and supporting, are consistently engaging. Episode 7 had me feeling actual human emotions. For a villain, no less. That hasn\u2019t happened since Thanos.\\n\\n\r\nCells At Work has plenty of errors in its genetic makeup, but its core skeleton is solid and reliable. It has heart. It has nerve. It has brainpower to match. If you\u2019re looking for a red-blooded shounen anime with high levels of dopamine, direct your retinas no further than this show.\\n\\n\r\nOn a related note, I think I have a pun infection.\\n",

            "content": "Well, how can I say this, Cells At Work is by far the most educational anime I have seen so far in my history of watching anime. Not to mention its the first time I've seen such show focuses mainly on the interior of the human body, other than Ozzy and Drix. The whole concept concentrates primarily on immunology and injury-response of cells in our body, and yet we haven't seen its involvement in reproduction. It is fascinating how directly pathology/biology explanation can be made so interesting and provides valuable information. \r\nStory: 8 \r\nIn the early half of the season, each week we get tosee how different cells respond to different bacterial invasion into our circulation and organs. Each week we received new lectures on how each cells function (& formed) within the specific area of the body/infection. It fascinates me how narrative the information was provided and application of their duty to the disease. Not to mention we get to witness amazing relationship development between cells to add an entertainment touch to it. Also, comedy was added to provide laughter rather than the boring teaching of functions. The story was directed well to captivate dramatic scenes such as fights between bacteria, and yes, cancer itself. The final episode was icing on the cake as we witness how determined the cells are to keep the body alive.     \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8 \\n\r\nFantastic character design especially with the details of the clothing of macrophages and T-Cells. The splashing of blood from bacteria characters was unique and well animated to provide suspense of its eradication. The scenery was magnificently enlivened to represent the interior of the human body parts in a fictional way.  \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9 \\n\r\nThe opening was quite catchy to get the audience excited for the episode with the characters saying its title. Additionally, provides good tunes to create energy in the music. As for the ending, nothing beats ClariS, as a big fan of their music they did not disappoint with the beautifully written piece to provide cheerful rhythm to end the episode. As for background music, especially during fight scenes, was well adapted to the environment to elicit the right feeling to the scenes.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9 \\n\r\nMy girl Macrophage is by far my favourite as she is deadly and beautiful with a deathly smile to make my day. Platelets were the stand out favourites for the anime community with the endless memes, clips and merchandises off for grabs, especially with the talent of Naganawa, her amazing childish voice made Platelets the most loveable characters of this series. The RBC and WBC appeared every episode to provide a comedian and romantic development as the season progresses, not to mention they knew each other since their development in the bone marrow. The T-Cells offer much more brutality feeling to them, which reflects how T-Cells are supposed to be in our body.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8 \\n\r\nSaying that I enjoyed this show is an understatement. Not to mention I upload weekly reaction videos on YouTube on this fantastic series. Each week provides different challenges which make this show the most enjoyable and reflects how educational-flow as the season progresses as each week offers new valuable information to fill my knowledge gap. A good mix of action and comedy, and yes kawaii platelets scenes, sums up how amazing this series is. Providing a bit more social development will push its ranking.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I highly recommend watching this anime as it provides valuable biology information weekly, and guaranteed fictional description to reinforce the learning.  \\n\\n",

            "content": "So what happens when you put education, anime, and Japan's constant need to make everything cute to the point that they anthropomorphize everything from animals to navy vessels all together?\u00a0 This.\u00a0 This is that result.\u00a0\u00a0\r\nStory:\r\nIn the human body, there are trillions of cells that work in all hours of the day to protect the body that they're in to ensure its survival.\u00a0 But given the body's apparent fragility in terms of how permeable it is and the very nature of nature itself causing mini mistakes within an organism's body, the life of the cells is constant battle against those that threaten the body they inhabit.\r\nStructuredas an episodic series, each episode of Cells at Work features the body where our resident red blood cell AE3803 encounters various pathogens and bodily conditions that make her otherwise normal workday as a red blood cell of transporting nutrients and oxygen to various cells around the body a living nightmare as the constant threat of death is almost always right around the corner.\u00a0 As a result, Hataraku Saibou is one of those shows that you watch for its novelty, being a creature/situation of the week kind of show with a lot of charm to its quirky and unique setting, especially since the show teaches a lot about basic circulation/blood biology with a few intricate concepts and fun facts thrown in to mesh with the narrative.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ VERY unique show\\n\r\n+ Educational!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nAE3083 is primarily the cell that the show focuses on, being a red blood cell with terrible direction sense (ironic for a cell whose job is being a biological deliveryman) and is usually in trouble since she's a target being the kind of cell made to help other cells prosper.\u00a0 Wanting to be actually good at her job, the series doesn't really do much to develop her character, but instead gets lost and ends up as being involved in the various incidents the show presents by virtue of just being there.\\n\\n\r\nThe other primary character is U1146, a neutrophil (common white blood cell) that's usually first on the scene whenever a rogue antigen shows up on screen.\u00a0 Compared to his compatriots in the cast, U1146 is the primary director for the most of the show's more 'humanizing' moments, as his desire to understand and get to know the various cells around him who by their nature, also work just a single job and do that job their entire lives shows up from time to time and gives some surprising depth to a primarily comedic/education based series.\\n\\n\r\nVarious other cells like the macrophages, dendrite cells, brain cells, killer T cells, B cell, and the ever loved Platelets (who are portrayed children due to their smaller size compared to other blood cells) add in a diverse and memorable cast because everyone gets their moment in the spotlight thanks to a convenient narration by Mamiko Noto to describe their function, made even more apparent when the show tackles a situation where their specific functions/job is needed in order to solve the situation at hand.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Surprisingly a good amount of character depth\\n\r\n+ Extremely memorable cast of characters\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nMade by David Production, aka the 'Jojo's Bizarre Adventure' company, Hataraku Saibou is a pleasant mix of cute, funny, and incredibly violent, as the life of AE3083 is filled with lots of running away/avoiding the massive amounts of problems that the body she lives in encounters, before the white blood cells come in and slash away at their foes, spilling massive amounts of blood before their fallen foes bear comedic X's over their eyes.\u00a0\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nWhat's more than the show's bright colors and pleasant to look at style is the structure of the world, since the body we're shown is structured like a human society, with many organs portrayed as unique buildings, blood vessels as long sidewalks that all of the blood cells use to traverse, and the cells as people who live within the apartment blocks that represent their location in the body.\u00a0 It's one of those things that's more genius the more you think about it, due to the idea that a body is just a massive society of smaller beings is made into a literal sense.\u00a0\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Hilariously easy switches between violence and comedy\\n\r\n+ Very creative world\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\n\"Mission! Ken\u30fbKou\u30fbDai\u30fbIchi\" sung by the seiyuus of AE3083, macrophage, U1146, and Killer T cell is a very memorable song, being an upbeat almost band-like song with a catchy beat that replicates the quirkiness of the show to a tee.\u00a0 Very rarely do I find seiyuu songs as memorable as this, and this is definitely one of the better ones in recent memory.\u00a0 By comparison, its ED sister of\u00a0\"CheerS\" by ClariS is a more pleasant song with less energy, and instead gives a nice \"Good work!\" conclusion to the episode's current problem.\u00a0 It's a satisfying listen, worth repeats to moments of unwinding, like after a hard day's work.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nHataraku Saibou was never a show that I really had on my radar when I first heard about it.\u00a0 Through virtue of the internet spreading the first episode like wildfire, it eventually became one of those things that just ended up on my list, and eventually something that I really looked forward to watching every week.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nSuffice to say, Hataraku Saibou was a very enjoyable (and educational) experience that was one of those episodic romps that was worth the time invested into it.\u00a0 Hearing Hanakana scream at the top of her lungs as AE3083 was running away from a different pathogen every week was somehow funny every time, and the show's consistent quirkiness left me without many complaints to make since I enjoyed every episode regardless of what it was about.\u00a0 True the mini arcs and humanization of blood cells did give me a bit of an existential crisis given the fact that the show manages to get the audience to pity CANCER of all diseases, but all in all, definitely a fun watch.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nA definite recommendation for those wanting something truly unique in their anime watching experience.",

            "content": "Well LA learned alot about the body...in all it's crazy bloody glory way, who says that anime can't be educational?\r\nHataraki Saibou is about the body and all the functions it does in a daily basis. Hataraku Saibou follows AE3803, a red blood cell with no sense of direction where she continuously gets ambushed by germs, viruses and bacteria where U-1146, a white blood cell comes in to take the threat down. Hataraku Saibou's narrative structure mainly follows AE3803 as she goes through some events in the body that is daily for us but a MAJOR event life threatening event in the body, be it heatstroke, bacteria infesting the body, circulation and even dealing with the early phases of cancer!\\n\\n\r\nFor the most part we do get some level of development when it comes to AE3803 and U-1146, mainly of how they met as well as the typical \"they knew each other in childhood\" as well. These two gets the most growth mainly to due them being the narrative focus of many episodes, we of course get to see the functions of other cells in our body with some development form them as well, like Killer T Saibou voiced by Daisuke Ono, Macrophage voiced by Kikuko Inoue and the Platelets voiced by Maria Naganawa who are pretty much in every episode, with some one off episode cells like Eosinophil voiced by M.A.O and NK Saibou voiced by Toa Yukinari.\\n\\n\r\nHataraku Saibou by all means and purposes anthropomorphize our body's cells and tells us useful information about body with great amount of accuracy which is helped by the narrator voiced by Mamiko Noto giving us the information about each cell every episode (though yes, the narrator repeats ALOT of the information we already know at times, making her sometimes repetitive but for someone who isn't exactly a biologist or a doctor no less helps even with it's repetitiveness and gives us information on hand as to what's going on). Hataraku Saibou by all means makes learning about the body and how it functions both cool and educational to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nHataraku Saibou's atmosphere for the most part has the moe aesthetic towards itself especially with some of the cells like the Platelets, red blood cells and Macrophage BUT also goes JOJO levels of crazy action that comes it's way, from the blood-hungry white blood cells to the much more buff Killer T cells and finally the Macrophage cells which perfectly sums up what Hataraku Saibou is like...moe silk yet has steel underneath. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation done by David Production also easily makes the comparison to Jojo's and it quite obviously shows but David Production didn't skimp on the production value of this anime, being rather detailed and sure it has some reusable content, but nonetheless from the vibrant atmosphere, distinct character designs, the crazy bloody filled action and the sheer amount of various destruction of our body in animated form is grand to say the least. David Production outdid themselves!\\n\\n\r\nAs for voice acting, the entire voice cast is great and LA really didn't have a problem with ANY of the cast members. This might be because of so many well known voice actors in this anime such as Kana Hanazawa, Kikuko Inoue, Saori Hayami, M.A.O, Mamiko Noto, Aya Endou, Tomokazu Sugita, Tomoaki Maeno and Maria Naganawa and if LA had to give MVP, then....Tomoaki Maeno as U-1146 and Kana Hanazawa as AE3803.\\n\\n\r\nHataraku Saibou takes looking into the human body and makes it both funny, action packed and more precisely accurate and LA really liked it and even if it has an episodic format to itself and some running gags, that is a small determent to an anime that's this bombastic, educational or not, Hataraku Saibou is a good anime, from it's characters, episodic plot, well animated and voice acted and the daily chaos our body through shown in animated form.\\n\\n\r\nAnd to think LA didn't even make one Osmosis Jones references....wait F-",

            "content": "This review was edited to fit the spoilers rules of MAL.\r\nAs you can asume reading the premise this anime is not only trying to be a comedy about the human body (keyword: trying) is also an educational parody. Every single episode feature a new type of cell, showing what they can do, how they behave and why they important. These kind of ideas are usually easy to handle because are aimed to kids and they don't have a lot of critical thinking, they just want to watch some cartoons with silly characters doing silly things and if you can teach them some basic knowledge atthe same time go on but this is not for kids what probably explains why most of the characters are waifus for desperate otakus.\\n\\n\r\nThe main problem of Hataraku Saibou is not other than the core idea of the show because the only way known by the writers to give information is through extensive monologues full of complex medical terms that no average person knows or remember from school because is not the kind stuff you use in your daily life unless you are a doctor. This happens several times per episode, even in the middle of a battle, which by the way are not very exciting for the total lack of tension, strategies or a higher budget but these are not manly men in flamboyant clothes so what can you expect.\\n\\n\r\nComedy is another important issue. Nobody tell a joke ever or made something funny with some exceptions, all the humor is based around overreaching. Apparently most mangakas thinks that cute anime girls doing cute things are inherently funny (protip: they are not).\\n\\n\r\nTalking about cute girls, the designs in this anime are so dull. These are not cells at work. These are people working in a fabric made of metal and concrete not a human body. You can made fun of how cheesy was Ozzy and Drix but at least that show had a recognizable setting.\\n\\n\r\nAt last, I wouldn't like to focus too much in one single episode but this is something outrageous that need to be said. [SPOILER WARNING] from this point on, of course.\\n\\n\r\nIn episode seven cancerogenous cells are victimized as innocent children that didn't asked to be created, tha are merciless hunted by the other cells, called by names and hated without reason.\\n\\n\r\nSo I don't know if you already knew this but\u2026 cancer kills. A lot. Why would we feel bad about cancer? Even in a alternate dimension were this is less offensive, the process of spreading was showed like a sabotage operation which requires a lot of planeation, so he could desists of his vengueance at any point to show them that cancer cells can be good (I can belive I just wrote that) but no, he proved they were right by acting like what everyone expected from cancer and he was still whining whenever they called him a monster.\\n\\n\r\nHataraku Saibou is plain bad. Is too complicated to be educational, too bored to be a comedy, characters are shallow and forgettabl,e and honestly you probably watching it only for the memes. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.",

I am a sucker for good storytelling and characters, but I normally don't seek out science related anime. However white blood cell is so badass, I can't stop watching the show, every time I see him, it's the best day ever. I love how the anime is trying to show us how the cells in body live and work together. Every episode helped me appreciate all the work my body does on a daily basis. If you wantto learn more about your body and the processes that go on, you should definitely watch it! I love how the characters match their functions and how their personalities are interesting. Every time we got a backstory or spend time a character, the more I loved them.",

            "content": "Cell's at Work at it's core is an educational Saturday morning show. Made to be more entertaining than usual with cute and colorful characters. It is fun and has a good unique premise.\r\nI wanted to wait until the whole season is over but given the episodic nature of the show, what I think of the show right now will most likely be the same as it is when it is done. \r\nOverall, the show is really enjoyable. Cute characters like the Platelets will be all over anime conventions for years to come. Red and White Blood Cells will be represented plentifully too. But I feellike the art is kind of meh. Nothing exceptional but it works as it is.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is nothing too special as well. It works but nothing memorable comes out of it. \\n\\n\r\nWhat makes the show flowing are the characters though. Pun intended. Our main red blood cell (AE3803) is clumsy but I can't find a way to hate it. White Blood Cell U-1146 is the show's main badass along with the other supporting immune cells like the Killer T, Eosinophil, and Macrophage.\\n\\n\r\nI can't say the same for the villains as they are all, to put it bluntly, kind of shit. An exception might be Cancel Cell but so far he's just in an episode and a half. I hope he does show up to be the main villain at the finale or someone more interesting that what we have been given so far.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're still on the fence about this show, my review is not really glowing but I would very much recommend it. It is really enjoyable. Not amazing but it does what it aims to be perfectly.",

While the idea is great, and the cast is filled with amazing and talented names even for the side characters, the execution is a bit off in later episodes.\r\nAs of now I've seen around 2/3 of the episodes they have planned for this season and I'm pretty sure the structure won't change too much over the last 1/3. Not to say it's a bad thing, but it gets a little repetitive when each and every episode is filled with a similar event just involvingdifferent side characters. \\n\\n\r\nOn an educational point of view I'll probably remember more from this than I will from any of my science classes, but from an anime perspective it just lacks that deep and meaningful story-line to push it anywhere past the \"good\" range. If I had to compare it to another anime it would be like the first few episodes of Bleach where all Ichigo does is kill Hollows. \\n\\n\r\nStill an entertaining anime, but I wouldn't recommend to anyone who doesn't like repetitive events.",
