            "content": "The lack of popularity surrounding Hunter x Hunter (2011) has always confused me, especially after catching up to it six months ago. For an anime that seems to do everything right, it isn't talked about a lot at a popular level. Neither has it been successful in garnering a fan base similar to that of SNK or SAO. I decided to write this review to do the show justice. If a show this good is still flying under your radar or if you are discouraged from watching this because of its \"childish appearance\" then reading this review is a must.\r\nStory:\r\nHxH is about a young boynamed Gon who embarks on a journey to find his father. After learning that his father left him at a young age to become a Hunter, Gon decides to follow in his footsteps not only to find him, but also to see what was so special about the profession that made his father choose it over him. Although a story of finding one's father is simple, it is the path that is taken towards this end that makes the series truly special. HxH is made up of several arcs that are all extremely well-written, which brings me to the best part of the series, the writing. Hunter x Hunter (2011) boasts one of the finest writing in the world of shonen; the depth and flow of the story, enthralling characterizations, strong dialogue and impressive world-building are all crafted into a fascinating tale that can absorb viewers into lengthy marathons. \\n\\n\r\nThe amount of variety that is packed into HxH's story is also very impressive. HxH successfully dabbles in several genres in six story arcs tackling survival, fighting tournaments, crime thriller, virtual realities, war and politics. Not only that, the series is also able to undergo significant tonal shifts with ease (light to dark and vice versa). Sometimes, these shifts in tone occur after an arc ends though other times, it even occurs mid-arc. Another thing about HxH is that its arcs are connected with one another, with each arc naturally following the one before it. This creates a natural transition that highlights what the series really is, a journey. As for pacing and development, they are excellent. For the most part, HxH is very well paced. The series does a fantastic job at keeping its viewers engaged, time will fly by as you watch most episodes and you'll find yourself breezing through the show. Excluding two recap episodes, HxH has no filler episodes. Due to this, story progression is solid with the plot moving forward with each episode.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough HxH initially gives off a light hearted impression, it gives off a good one. Not the kind of \u201clight heartedness\u201d that makes you say \u201cthis is childish and below me\u201d but the kind that appeals to everyone. HxH gives off that classic and charming shonen vibe that has been lost in recent years, and it does so with its head held up high. Eventually though, the series takes a dark turn. Although most HxH story arcs are light hearted, both Yorknew and the Chimera Ant arc are two of the best and darkest arcs shonen has to offer. Yorknew can be described as a dark thriller in a big city. The central theme of the arc is revenge and it is similar to Death Note in terms of thrill and atmosphere. On the other hand, the Chimera Ants arc can be described as an attempt by the Hunters Association to control an outbreak of a dangerous man-eating species. It is the darkest and most thematically powerful arc in the series tackling themes such as identity, human nature and survival of the fittest. The arc has drawn comparisons to Yu Yu Hakusho\u2019s Chapter Black for its seinen-like nature and is similar to Shingeki no Kyojin, where the protagonists experience a strong sense of despair in the face of a vastly superior, hostile species. The series undergoes major tonal shifts in both arcs with the color palette, music, atmosphere and amount of violence changing significantly. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, what sets the series apart from other battle anime is its unorthodoxy and unpredictability. Shonen tropes and storytelling methods are undermined throughout the series. The main character for example, Gon, fails more than he succeeds. Power-ups based on emotion or willpower are non-existent and fighting in the series is radically different from other battle anime. The main protagonist is not the main focus of every arc either. At certain points in the series, you could even say that Gon has taken a supporting role, especially during the later portions of the CA arc where he isn't given as much focus due to the grand scope of the story. The standard battle anime formula of \u201close-train-win\u201d is also undermined. Although there is training, it does not always translate to a victory, nor does it propel the protagonists over or to the same level as their main adversaries in terms of strength. For the most part, the protagonists assume the underdog role. Although they have incredible potential, they are still kids who have a lot to learn. In terms of storytelling, unpredictable developments are commonplace. One thing that continues to amaze me with this show is how it leads viewers into thinking that the story will progress in this direction, only to change course and arrive at a completely different outcome. A good example of this would be the series' arcs which often end in an anti-climatic manner. Basically, there are a lot of scenes and story developments that you won\u2019t see coming because they defy conventional shonen storytelling or are unpredictable in their own right.\\n\\n\r\nThe series' unorthodoxy can also be seen in its fights which are primarily cerebral. In addition to being well-executed, HxH fights are smart and involve a lot of strategy. Raw power is a factor but it is not the factor that decides battle outcomes, actual power (nen abilities), experience and strategy are all taken into account. If a main character is outclassed by an opponent in all or most categories, he is likely to lose. Moreover, main characters are not given any special treatment in combat. This smart approach to fighting is further enhanced by nen, a unique and complex power system held by defined rules. The concept of nen, its principles, aura types and many applications on the battlefield reveal the huge amount of thought that was put into it. I still remember having to pause episodes, even research a bit during its introduction, just to digest it in its entirety. \\n\\n\r\nThe appearance and writing of the series also create an effect of cognitive dissonance, the simplistic look of the show mentally conflicts with the brilliance and unorthodoxy of its writing. As new viewers delve deeper into HxH, they realize that there is much more to the show than its cover art and synopsis suggest. Expectations of the series being immature, simple or generic are progressively overturned as the show reveals its surprising underbelly.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nAs for sound, HxH has a line of great soundtracks that started off decent but got better as the series progressed. With the exception of a few minor characters, the voice acting in this series is excellent. As a person who has never seen the old series it\u2019s hard to believe that these aren't the original voices because they fit extremely well, especially those of Gon, Killua and Hisoka whose voice actors do a perfect job of capturing their characters. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nHxH also has great art and animation. It amazes me how a long-running series like HxH delivers consistent quality animation episode after episode, especially during the fights. The series does a great job of capturing facial expressions and everything from the lighting, shading and colors adjust perfectly depending on the mood of the scene or the tone of the arc. As one reviewer (nagaiyume) said, the bright colors of the show might need some getting used to, though it is usually fans of the old series who have this problem. Personally, I think it fits the show perfectly. It adds to the charm of the series by complementing its sense of adventure, uplifting atmosphere and unique appeal as a shonen that looks simple but is actually remarkably deep. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nAlthough HxH\u2019s primary strength lies in its writing, its characters come pretty damn close. HxH has a huge cast of characters. They have quirks, dreams, inner demons, world views and overall, really likable personalities. To top it off, most of them don\u2019t follow generic character archetypes. Although some may initially come across as \u201cgeneric\u201d, these assumptions are gradually undermined as the series progresses. \\n\\n\r\nIf there's one thing I want to emphasize in the character department it would be the series main villains. When it comes to characters, this is where the show shines the brightest. HxH villains are extremely well-written (with the exception of the Bomber who won't apply to most of what I'll say below). Not only are their characterizations independently impressive, they are also distinct from one another; no two villains are the same. This distinctness does not only apply within the series but outside of it. You won't find another Hisoka, Chrollo or Ant King in any other anime. This is what makes HxH villains so compelling, in addition to having really impressive characterizations, they are also original. Although I excluded one out of the four main villains from most of what I wrote above, all HxH villains do have one thing in common. Each villain strikes fear into audience, the series does a good job of establishing the level of danger these characters bring to the story and our protagonists. \\n\\n\r\nNegatives:\\n\r\nHowever, while HxH is a great series it isn't perfect. The series doesn't have a strong start, it takes three episodes for show to get going. I've seen a lot of people drop HxH early and it sucks because the first two episodes don't capture the series at all. Things start to get mildly interesting in the third episode, after that, the series just gets better and better. HxH also suffers from occasional BGM misuse. There are odd sound choices for some scenes. Sometimes they don\u2019t really fit, other times they don\u2019t fit it all. Lastly, the Chimera Ant arc also has minor issues with both Togashi and Madhouse to blame. Togashi\u2019s fault lies in his writing during the middle of the CA arc which I think, pales in comparison to the rest of the series. HxH has made a name for itself for holding a consistent high level throughout its run; it\u2019s a series that\u2019s just so engaging and easy to marathon. However, I believe this consistency took a hit mid-CA arc (due to handling of the story and pacing) specifically, episodes 89-98. Don\u2019t get me wrong though, I think there are a fair number of good episodes within that 9-episode stretch but unfortunately, they are surrounded by mediocre episodes that break the consistency of an otherwise exceptional arc. Madhouse\u2019s fault lies in its adaption of the manga chapters comprising episodes 113 and 115, which were dragged out in order to have episode 116 handled by their best animation team. Episode 113 was actually well paced except for one atrocious sequence while episode 115 as a whole was generally poorly paced.\\n\\n\r\nA clarification about the \"slowed down pacing\" of Chimera Ant arc:\\n\r\nIf you\u2019ve been reading up about HxH, you\u2019ve probably seen some people complain about the \u201cpoor pacing\u201d during the \u201cnarration heavy episodes\u201d of the CA arc. Well if you\u2019re wondering how much truth is there to this statement and were going to ask me about it, my answer would be it depends.\\n\\n\r\nAt episode 111, the palace invasion (climax of the CA arc) begins and narration begins to play a huge role in episodes in order to (1) pack a whole level of depth into the story and (2) increase dramatic tension. Rather than a high octane \"action fest\" people would expect from a shonen arc climax, the palace invasion takes a psychological heavy route wherein a character\u2019s thoughts and mental state are given more focus than the actual action. This psychological focus together with the narration slows down the pace considerably in the sense that episodes begin to cover a lot less in narrative time. However, despite this \u201cslowed down pace\u201d, the pacing of these episodes remain solid with good amount of manga chapters being covered during each of these episodes and the duration of scenes being on point (except for episodes 113 and 115 which I mentioned earlier in this review).\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, it depends if the narration works on you or not. If you like the psychological approach and experience an increase in suspense then you\u2019ll have no problems with the pacing and are in for one helluvah of a ride. However, if you don\u2019t like the psychological approach and feel that the narrator\u2019s heavy presence breaks your immersion then you\u2019re in for a grueling experience. Of course, there are other combinations such as liking the psychological route but not feeling the immersion or maybe the narration just didn't work on you completely. Well, if this happens to be the case then you\u2019ll end up with mixed feelings. On the bright side, most people who end up watching the invasion end up enjoying the narration. However, if you happen to be one of the good number of people who end up not liking the narration don\u2019t worry, only episodes 111-118 of the palace invasion have heavy narration. After episode 118, the narration begins to decrease and episodes eventually reach a point where they are \u201cback to normal\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nHeads up to people looking for action:\\n\r\nAlthough I love the fighting aspect of the series and consider it to be a strong plus, I\u2019ll leave this out there for the sake of subjectivity. HxH does not cater to everyone. Although fights in the series are well-executed, they are also short (1-10 minutes) and happen less in comparison to other battle anime. Moreover, the focus on strategy in battles might be off putting to people who prefer fights with more brawn and less brain. If you're expecting an action heavy series like Yu Yu Hakusho then you will be disappointed. This is because HxH is a series that relies on its story to reel in viewers. Personally, I think this is how fighting in shonen should be done. Fighting should be able to entertain and also make you think. It shouldn't drag on for too long at the expense of the story without leaving you underwhelmed. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\nHunter x Hunter (2011) is an intelligent battle anime with a fantastic story, excellent characters and fights that involve a lot of strategy. Separating it from most of its genre, the series subverts shonen tropes and boasts unpredictable plot progressions that make it truly unique.\\n\\n\r\nOverall scores:\\n\r\nStory: 10/10 (Outstanding)\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10 (Outstanding)\\n\r\nArt: 9/10 (Great)\\n\r\nSound: 8/10 (Great but occasionally misused)\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10 (Extremely high)\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10 (Masterpiece)",

            "content": "---The review contains spoilers---\r\n\u201cYou should enjoy the little detours. To the fullest. Because that\u2019s where you\u2019ll find the things more important than what you want\u201d. (Hunter Election Arc).\r\nI don\u2019t have words enough to describe what was this 148 episodes for me.\r\nI'll not spend this review talking about the Synopsis, because It\u2019s right here on MAL.\r\nI need to tell you, why you must watch this masterpiece, and what it represents to me.\r\nFirst of all I\u2019m gonna talk about the final episode. I felt Joy, sadness, angry (Togashi hurry up with the manga! hahah), and of course, satisfaction. Satisfaction because I heard my friends (you NEEDto watch it), because it wasn\u2019t time wasted, because those 148 episodes, and the nights that I spent watching, were worth, really. Hunter x Hunter is a complex anime, a peculiar story, something that, certainly, will mix up with your feelings, with your thoughts, with your conception of a Shonen. \\n\\n\r\nWhat do I mean? It\u2019s not that simple. But I\u2019ll try to clarify: Don\u2019t think that you\u2019re about to find predictable arcs. Don't think that the heroes gonna always beat the villains (In some parts of the story... nobody wins). Don\u2019t think that training and good skills can ensure that you'll defeat an enemy, sometimes you'll need more than that. Behold what humans can be (and Togashi show us really well in Chimera Ant Arc). Behold what friendship can be, in all it\u2019s complexity. You\u2019re not gonna see in this anime that kind of Main Character that is AWESOME for no reason, no training. Togashi will make you understand the personality of the characters and their powers. Power, I mean, Nen or aura (vital energy), similar to what we see in other shonens like, Dragon Ball (Ki) or Naruto (Chakra). It's presented to us really well how the \"Nen system\" works. The explanations are long in some episodes, but simple to understand. \\n\\n\r\nTalking now about the animation: Hunter x Hunter is breathtaking . Indeed, it can be said that Madhouse did an excellent job with the remake . I was amazed with what I saw in some episodes. I confess that many of them I've watched over and over again, just to observe the details of the animation, and not only what was happening in the story ( Episode 131 I\u2019ve watched 4 times ). In the end , I'm grateful that Madhouse animated Hunter x Hunter from the beginning .\\n\\n\r\nThe characters.. oh they are unique, really. It's quite impressive how Togashi gave to them a variety of personalities. You'll not gonna enjoy only the four main characters (although many consider that the main are Gon and Killua, since the story focuses more on the two of them from a certain phase). Hunter x Hunter have a significant  character development on the supporting ones too, and, of course in the villains (you'll love them, believe me).  I don't have a favorite character in this show. It's impossible to choose one. Watch it and you'll experience what I'm saying.\\n\\n\r\nYou mean this show has nothing bad?\\n\r\nYes it has.\\n\r\n1) The worst thing in this show is: It ended.\\n\r\nOkay, joking aside, I think is the worst part is the beginning. You have to watch 4 or 5 episodes to feel in the mood to still watching. Many people just gave up in the first episodes. I can ensure you, go on and watch it til the end. \\n\r\nParticularly I don\u2019t like so much The Hunter Exam Arc, the first arc of the story. If you compare with the other arcs it\u2019s really not the best one. I have in my heart this two arcs: Chimera Ant Arc and Yorknew city Arc.\\n\\n\r\nThe second thing many fans of the show complains a LOT, is the Opening song. Why? 148 episodes, different openings, but... THE SAME SONG. For me it wasn't a problem at all. I love the song, and... I think I watched the opening \u201cone hundred and forty-eight\u201d times and I sang it. Hahaha. But I really wanted to see a new song too.\\n\\n\r\nThe third thing is totally my personal opinion: the narrator. Your first contact with him will be in the begining of the early episodes. He will explain what is a Hunter.\\n\r\nThe narration it's something that we don't see a lot in other animes. I like it, it's brilliant and I totally understand that this add gives the anime the suspense and it's particular style. \\n\r\nThe advantage of having a narrator, in my opinion, is the ''observer factor''. Instead of exploring the point of view of all the characters, we have that peculiar element that seems to know everything and adds important information to the audience. \\n\r\nBut, eventually, the narrator annoys me, specially in the Chimera ant Arc. I mean: we see what's going on, it's not necessary an explanation! \\n\r\nOf course that the ''narration effect'' will depend on the way you receive it. Sometimes will give that \"slow motion\" you'll need to absorb what's going on, but in a few episodes it's really overused. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I have to thank above all, you Togashi Yoshihiro. You're brilliant. You can make unique characters, outstanding plots. You still go on, and on,  in successive hiatus in the manga, and everyone complains a lot (even me), but then what you show to us is so amazing that makes it worth waiting. Thank you for exist and for this awesome masterpiece.\\n\r\nFor you that didn't watch it yet, do not be fooled by the first few episodes or with the synopsis. Both of them will give you the impression that you're about to see a generic shounen. Insist. This is a kind of anime that in each episode everything seems to evolve: the story, the setting, the characters. You will be hooked, unable to stop watching .\\n\r\nAnd then my friend, you will start to feel pain. Yes, pain, when you realize that you're at the 100\u00ba episode and there is only 48 episodes left.\\n\\n\r\nEmbrace this adventure called Hunter x Hunter! xD",

            "content": "At first, when I read the synopsis of hunter x hunter (2011) (for the rest of this review will be called hxh as abbreviation) I could not quite deduce the rationality of this show being scored and reviewed with such praise as it receives on a daily basis. I am sure many of you ,who are planning to pick up this show sometime soon, are thinking the same as I did before watching this show and I will do my best to change any contravening opinions towards this series.\r\nStory: 9\r\nAs you all have likely read the synopsis of hxh, it certainly stands out from mostother shounen ever made. There is a kid that decides to go on an adventure, for a particular purpose, meets friends, becomes stronger and eventually defeats powerful opponents. It doesn't come off as a very complex or intriguing story/plot, nor is there a generic/forgettable cast and an amassed other facts that would remind you of how forgettable this show probably is. Believe me it's not.\\n\r\nBeyond the first few episodes which this generalised speculation derives from, you will see that hxh differs from most shounen in terms of intelligence (strategic battles, clever arcs and plot) and the pacing of the whole show throughout each arc is outstanding. The absence of fillers throughout the 148 episodes ( excluding recaps) makes this show that much less frustrating to watch.\\n\r\nYou may have heard an arc in particular, that the MAL community keeps on raving about: the Chimera Ant arc. Without throwing any spoilers in this review, the hype is worth it. This arc is, by most fans of the franchise, seen as a masterstoke and with good reason. The previous arcs create a substantial build-up to the C.A arc which makes the emphasis and usefulness of the arc that much more prominent.\\n\r\nHowever, the only factor that prevented my rating of a 9 to a 10, was the slow start and the half-open ending; while it not bad and was a good conclusion to the show, left the viewer rather unsettled with the whole experience.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\\n\r\nWhere hxh really shines is in the shows' magnificent cast. As stated in my introduction, typically, most shounen do not have the best cast of characters that anime has brought out to the community, and more often than not defeat their enemies using the all-mighty force that is  'the power of friendship(!)' which brings sweet victory and joy to the protagonists of the show. Forget this ever existed in anime when watching hxh, as the sincere friendship that is witnessed between the main cast is nothing short of magnificent. It is realistic and evolves over a long period of time.\\n\r\nWhat makes the characters of hxh further at a stand-point, is that the antagonists are (for the most part) just as likable as the protagonists. Every character is very well developed ( every = any character that mattered to the story) and therefore does not make you want to spurt out the words \" Wow, this character sucks \" , with the exception of the bomber which, when watching the series, you will notice that had no real purpose for doing things to the extent that he did.\\n\r\nFinally, I will talk about my three favorite characters of the series:\\n\\n\r\n1. Gon\\n\\n\r\nI love Gon. At first he seems like your everyday generic protagonist that has no potential to evolve as a person. He comes across as useless and annoying.Then along the way something happens to him; something that is rarely in a protagonist like him. This is called ' Character Development '. The development that Gon receives throughout the series is fantastic and will make you love him until the end. He truly is desperate to find his father and the audience can see how he never throws in the towel.\\n\\n\r\n2. Killua\\n\\n\r\nThere's something really likable about white-haired guys in anime and Killua does not fall short in this aspect. He has a broad and complex backstory, and again, like Gon, significant development, which is seen to play a phenomenal role to how realistic the friendship between Gon and Killua is. His background as an assassin and his scarring childhood coupled with his raw talent and one-of-a-kind personality makes him a lovable and three-dimensional character.\\n\\n\r\n3. Meruem\\n\\n\r\nWithout spoiling much, Meruem is truly an unbelievable antagonist. At first you envision he is ruthless for no purpose, and comes off as a cliche and rather irritating being. With the meeting of another character you see how he evolves and how his facade in his personality makes him one of the best,if not the greatest character in the series.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation: 10\\n\\n\r\nWhen watching an anime that has a plethora of episodes such as hxh, one would expect a decline and rise in animation from time to time. However, Madhouse did a terrific job at keeping the animation and art as consistent and fluid as possible. The amount of money that was spent purely on budget really surprised me and the animation only gets better as the series progresses. When entering the C.A arc, you will see that Madhouse used their best animators to produce stunning images intertwined \\n\r\nwith outlines, shadows and fluency that serves as 'eye-candy' when watching the series. Battle sequences are as well a proof of how much effort is poured into this show, as the studio does not tend to cut corners, e.g using the same background over and over again.\\n\r\nThe opening and endings' animation improves significantly st time progresses, which blows my mind when comparing the differences in appearance. That is to say, the animation was brilliant at the start of the anime as well.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe opening: 'Departure'  is used throughout the entire anime although it switches between two different versions of the song, as well as changing the animation sequence each time, and this amazes me as every opening suits the anime perfectly! I did not skip the opening even once when watching the series; instead I stared smiling and singing along to the music.\\n\r\nThe endings are all fantastic in my opinion, and I love all the songs that are presented to the audience at the end of each episode. The order for me goes \\n\r\n1>4>2>3>5=6  (5 & 6 are different sections of the same song) but I love them all nevertheless.\\n\r\nThe ost of the anime is one of the best I have heard in any anime. My personal favorite is ' A kingdom of Predators'. It consists of a great variety of orchestra (mostly in the C.A arc) and lots of violin and piano that can be heard as well. However, sometimes the ost is not played at the most appropriate moments which prevents a score of 10 being given.\\n\r\nMonumental credibility must be given to the voice actors, and for Gon in particular, which is seen especially at episode 116, the mere brilliance that is spurted as 'emotions though words' is extraordinary. The only complaint that I sometimes hear arriving from people is that the narration in the C.A arc ( for around 10 episodes) is irritating and overwhelms the episodes, making them seem extremely slow-paced. I tend to  disagree with this argument , as the pacing seems to only benefit by the narration of those episodes, as it was a crucial moment in the series where narration was essential. I hope you won't find this narration an issue, since I certainly didn't.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nWow what a joyful ride this was. It keeps you hooked from early on and urges you to watch the next episode after experiencing the wonderful ending of each arc. The enjoyment factor, of course, originated from the entirety of the show. If any of the above were to be done poorly, the show would not come out to be nearly as enjoyable as it was. I not once felt bored during this series, and I believe that the pacing is fabulous. There's not a single moment that leaves the viewer wanting to skip ahead or fast-forward. As a result, I am almost certain that you will watch this show, engulfed by the brilliance of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\\n\r\nBelieve me when i tell you this: this show is a near masterpiece; as close of a masterpiece as a show of this genre gets. Don't be fooled while watching this anime, and drop it due to its slow start, as you may miss out on a truly miraculous experience.\\n\r\nThank you for reading my review of Hunter x Hunter (2011). Have a great day. RedInfinity out.",

            "content": "\"I see now... Yes... I see... You had me in checkmate from the start.\" - Meruem \r\nHunter x Hunter 2011 is incredibly well appreciated within the myanimelist community, however it never managed to grow a fanbase as large as the ones from other popular Shounen Series like Fairy Tail, Naruto, Bleach... Maybe it's because the series is much younger and I sincerely hope that one time HxH will be as popular as Naruto, because it just deserves it so much. I\u2019ve never seen a better Shounen Series, no a better Anime series before. Hunter x Hunter deserves every single praise it gets. It takes Shounento a whole new level. \\n\\n\r\nAt first glance, I wasn\u2019t too excited to watch Hunter x Hunter, in fact I even wanted to drop the Series after 3 episodes. Everything seemed like your stereotypical Shounen with an annoying protagonist in a scenario, where everything is happy throughout and the fights being overly predictable all the time. Oh, how wrong I was.\\n\\n\r\nAs I\u2019ve already mentioned, the story of HxH looks like the one of every single Shounen and it seems, that it won\u2019t offer new elements and topics. My thoughts were completely vanished before the tenth episode. Although the main idea of the young boy Gon trying to become Hunter and finding his father is very simple, the story gets incredibly deep and complex from time to time. The writing is spectacular throughout, the path\u2019s taken by the main characters to achieve their goals are incredibly creative and unpredictable, every arc offers new topics and even new genres, which couldn\u2019t be attached any better. In conclusion, HxH is the most marathonable Anime I\u2019ve seen so far.\\n\\n\r\nThe fighting system \u201cNen\u201d is very complex and offers near to a thousand different possibilities to fight. There are almost no emotion based Power-Ups in this Anime, most fights are decided by pure tactics, which makes the fights so interesting, at least for me.  \\n\\n\r\nThe story is divided in many different story arcs, like almost every long running Shounen. As I\u2019ve already mentioned, almost every arc sets up things differently. For example, the first arc \u201cHunter exam\u201d and the \u201cGreed Island\u201d arc have much of an adventure feeling, while arc the fourth arc \u201cYorknew City\u201d emphasizes much on thriller elements. Most of the arcs take a while to get things set up, for example the \u201cChimera Ant\u201d arc takes a while to get things set up perfectly, to finish in the most epic way possible with the best use of the genre \u201cDrama\u201d I\u2019ve ever experienced. \\n\\n\r\nThe pacing in Hunter x Hunter is very fast in general. Just compare the amount of chapters the Manga has in comparison to the amount of episodes. That means no fillers at all (if you don\u2019t count the two summery episodes near the beginning), no stupid fanservice, just straight forward Story, which is perfect in my book.  \\n\\n\r\nThe Animation is nearly perfect, that just shows how good Madhouse Animations are in general. The consistent Animation throughout this long Series seriously amazes me. Characters Design is top notch, backgrounds fit the scenery and atmosphere almost every time and facial expressions are done right. I don\u2019t know what specifically is criticize able in this section. \\n\\n\r\nConcerning the Sound, HxH offers a variety of different soundtracks, with true masterpieces in it. Soundtrack wise the Series offered nothing really memorable in the first episodes, but it got better and better when the story progressed, with scenes which couldn\u2019t be accompanied with a certain soundtrack any better. The voice actors did a very good job overall, especially the ones of Gon and Hisoka, which just fit their character perfectly in every scene. \\n\\n\r\nBesides the perfect writing, the second big strength of HxH are the characters and especially their development. Starting with the main character, Gon, his development is absolutely impressive in any way. In contrast to almost every other protagonist in a Shounen Series, Gon fails more than he succeeds and learns from his mistakes. The second main character, Killua, is written perfectly and his backgrounds, intensions etc. are very interesting. The other two members of the starting crew are Kurapika and Leorio, both having their own intentions, good development and understandable backgrounds as well.\\n\\n\r\nHowever the biggest strength of HxH character wise are the antagonists. They\u2019re written so perfectly and unique, you just can\u2019t hate them. You won\u2019t find another Hisoka, Kuroro or Meruem in another Anime, they\u2019re just too unique and likeable.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\nOverall, I have to say I\u2019m simply impressed by Hunter x Hunter in every regard, it\u2019s definitely the best Anime I\u2019ve seen so far and it won\u2019t be easy to fill the void after the Series ended. If you look for a Shounen, which is outstanding in terms of writing, story progression, character development and uniqueness, you have to watch Hunter x Hunter. While it has some weaknesses and rather mediocre episodes from time to time, those little mistakes can easily be overlooked due to the overall extremely high quality of all the other aspects. \\n\\n\r\nStory (9/10)\\n\r\nArt/Animation (9.5/10)\\n\r\nSound (9/10)\\n\r\nCharacters (10/10)\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10+/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall (10/10)\\n",

            "content": "After reading the many overwhelmingly positive reviews about this show, I've decided to write a more realistic, honest and unbiased opinion-driven review about this show.\r\nMany people have said how amazing this show is, and that it's incredibly unique and special. Did I? Well yes......and no.\r\nI am probably one of the very few people that didn't consider this series a masterpiece\r\nStory: \r\nHunters are people who hunt. Whether it is criminals, treasures, rare creatures or even food, they will hunt it.\r\nWe have the story of Gon, a young boy living on Whale island, aspiring to become a hunter like his father, Ging, a legendary hunter who abondonedhim while he was born to chase his dream. Gon also wants to meet his father and find out why he abondoned him while he was a baby.\\n\r\nTo become a hunter, he must pass the dastardly difficult hunter exams, which has an extremely low success rate. Along to way to the exams, he meets a few friends, rivals and a creepy paedo clown, hence beginning the first arc. After that, the concept of nen is introduced, which is basically the life force and magical power source of the series. The concept of nen is actually pretty cool, and it's more complicated to use than some other powers like alchemy and chakra, and it's creativity is often shined upon in fights. However, creativity can destory things aswell, and sometimes nen can be used as an over complicated ability with too much time used to explain different powers.\\n\r\nAfter the exams, there are arcs all varying in tones and stories and this is where problems arise. Some are dark, and some are light. Some arcs are excellent and others are well......terrible dog shit.\\n\r\nNone of the arcs are linked well together and are very disjointed and inconsistent. \\n\r\nInstead of focusing on an overall story, the arcs feel like a bunch of mini-stories building up to a main one, and they focus way too much on the individual arcs instead of an overall story, making it seem like a huge mess. One day, you've got a crime thriller, another one a video game, and then a bug apocalypse. One of the most critcally acclaimed arcs in the series, to me felt like a 60 episode filler, and that experience was not enjoyable at all. It baffles me on how people say it is a masterpiece, but everyone is entitled to their own opinion. The pacing in this arc was unbelievably bad, as was the horrible story and enemy designs (not the main villains though...they were badass).\\n\r\nThe best arc by far is the yorkshin city arc, which doesn't come until episode 40- something.\\n\r\nWhat's more disappointing is that the story of hunter x hunter had huge potential to look into the life of a hunter, but the hunter aspect of the show is not explored much. The final aspect that irked me about the story was over-using narration to the point of unbearable commenting into the smallest of details of the story complicating itself tenfold.\\n\r\nNow, what was good about the story? A decent amount, actually. In the earlier arcs of the series it felt a lot different from other shonen and the individual arc storytelling was actually working very well, as each arc had a purpose to the overall story. Each arc was well written, well paced and had it's fair share of enjoyable and memorable moments. Also the annoying narrator had much less to say. These earlier arcs were much more interesting and intriguing and didn't bore me the way the later arcs did. Really, the quality of the series started degrading by the end of the yorknew city arc.\\n\r\nThe early arcs didn't feel like fillers and contributed something, whereas the later arcs were just random and only inflicted minor things to the story, but did more to the development of the characters, which is not a bad thing, but dragging it out for 60 episodes is a crime in it's own right. Overall the story in hunter hunter varied from being amazing to a total dump. However \"the total dump\" is considered great by everyone, so you should check up the chimera ant arc anyway, you'll probably like it. What the entire story did well were the fights. All of them had wits and brains and didn't take an entire episode just to charge up an attack or talk for hours before the fight. (*cough* Dbz and naruto.)\\n\r\nHowever, when nen (the series' fighting system) kicks in the story downgrades hugely.\\n\r\nInstead of focusing on the story, we need to sit through pointless training regiments and stupid explanations of the usage of nen. Not to say i hate the series' fighting system, but in my opinion, it is far too complex and uninteresting and it sacrifices decent storytelling and replaces it with boredom. (Yes, it can be boring- if you've got a short attention span don't bother watching the later arcs)\\n\r\nAnd last thing I want to note is that the chimera ant arc's story was just horrible and boring- mostly due to its snail pacing.\\n\r\nThere were many plot holes (why would the hunter association send two under experienced twelve year olds to get rid of the ants? Why didn't netero just bomb the nest to begin with?)\\n\r\nand unnecessary plot points (the whole episode with gyro for example).\\n\r\nBut above all, it was boring, and I fell asleep watching it.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway story: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nFluid, colourful and bright, the animation is done very well. The large scale battles were animated gorgeously , and they are a joy to watch.\\n\r\nCharcater design wise is a mixed bag. Most of the characters are designed very well, in contrast to the godawful drawings from the manga. However, the chimera ants' design are absolutely horrendous. I know they are chimeras but while I was watching I thought to myself \"Wft is this?!\"\\n\r\nThe design for the chimera ants isn't the animation studio's fault though. The source material is to blame.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe ost is very good, but they do tend to re use the same tracks often so there can be a lack of variety. They also tend to forget earlier songs later in the series.\\n\r\nVoice acting wise, it's done superbly. All the voice actors blend and personalise their characters excellently and they display a lot of emotion and effort as they voice act their roles.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nNow this category is a bit difficult to review and I'll explain why later.\\n\r\nThe main cast consists of Gon, Killua, Kurapika and Leorio, but I'll focus mainly on Gon and Killua. There are other characters, ususally most important on seperate arcs and i will talk a little about them.\\n\\n\r\nGon is a 12 year old kid who is, in my opinion, an improved and more realistic version of kid Goku from the original dragon ball, except for the fact that he's not insanely over-powered.\\n\r\nThis makes it a good and bad thing. Good is that he's not only a more unique take on your usual happy go lucky young male protagonist, but that he's got layers of emotion to his character and has a rock-lee type moral to keep on getting stronger and improve yourself. Gon is steroeotypical and non stereotypical at the same time, and he's a badass little kid who strives on becoming stronger. The negative is that....he's still got a lot of the same thing. Gon can have a rather predictable personality. One minute he's a clueless little kid for comic relief and the other, he's crying when someone dies. He also doesn't get much development until much later in the show.\\n\r\nAll in all he's a decent take on your normal protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nKillua is the white-haired, slanted-eyed guy that's everyone's favourite and rightfully so. He's got a similar, but ultimately different ego compared to his best friend Gon's and he's got layers to his likable personailty and ferocious alter-ego as a darkness-fueled assassin. He's a cool laid back guy that has some serious skill and family relationships. He can seem pretty harmless at first, but piss him off and he'll tear you to shreads. Killua is the one that powers the dynamic and entertaining relationship between him and Gon, and he's a fan favourite character that definitely deserves it.\\n\\n\r\nNow what about the other main characters? THERE ARE NONE. That's right, don't be fooled by the artwork of the anime with gon,killua and the two others (Kurapika the blond cross-dresser and that tall dude with the glasses and suitcase who is Leorio). The other two guys only make appearances in the first arc and the Yorkshin, and then they are forgotten and become irrelevant which is a huge shame and it offends them as characters.\\n\r\nBasically, there's Gon and Killua and then everyone else. Gon and Killua are the only characters prominent throughout the series.\\n\r\nWell, Kurapika and Leorio could be called \"important\" side characters so I'll talk a bit about them.\\n\r\nKurapika is a blond-haired badass who is driven by revenge and everything that Sasuke Uchiha should have been. Because a certain organisation wiped out his clan, he desires to hunt that group down and get his revenge. He's also a complex character with layers to him and he's got one of the coolest powers in the show.\\n\r\nhowever, he only appears in about 40 episodes, which really sucks. We don't know what happens to him when the series ends either.\\n\\n\r\nLeorio is used as a comic relief guy early in the show and portrayed as a bad tempered, money obsessed businessman but he becomes more likable as the series goes on and develops his character with the little screen time he has. Long story short, he is a pretty entertaining and funny character that's certainly not useless.\\n\\n\r\nThe side characters and villains are great in their own right but it still irks me that they don't have much screen time until a certain arc, which is a shame.\\n\r\nKillua's family, the Zoldycks are a group of professional Asassins and most of them have a great and powerful presence and each have a set of their own unique personalities. It's a shame that they don't have much screentime.\\n\\n\r\nNetero, the chairman or, boss of the hunter organisation is a pretty complex guy too- you don't know if he's serious or not, you can't just read him like an open book. He's like master roshi or jiraiya with added insanity.\\n\r\nBisky is a mentor to Gon and Killua and she's a bit of a tsundere with a fearsome alter-ego.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in the chimera ant arc were truly horrible however. \\n\r\nNone of the new hunters in that arc were memorable or likable imho. Moving on.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes the series truly shine, however, are the villains. Whether it is a perverted clown, an evil brother, an insanely buffed steroid- addicted wild man, a calm, but truly evil mastermind or a bunch of powerful chimeras, all are interesting and wild in their own way.\\n\\n\r\n7/10 (for the lack of screentime for certain characters)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: it kinda depends. Some episodes have you on the edge of your seat and some may bore you with more dialogue. However, sometimes I did not enjoy the show simply because it tried too hard to over complicate things and over using narration. Other episodes could be amazing, however.\\n\r\nSome episodes were foreshadowing and building up to later events, and they  range in quality too.\\n\r\nEdit 16/07/15 \\n\r\nI am not saying that hunter x hunter is a bad anime- I'm just saying it's not for me. I thought the first third of it was really good and well written but after the yorknew city arc I just felt it became boring and that it wasn't the same as before.\\n\r\nI know im going to get plenty of hate for bashing the chimera ant arc, but remember it's just my opinion.\\n\r\nBut whatever, you can just be a fanboy and laugh at me for giving naruto and fairy tail higher ratings than the \"masterpiece\" that is hunter x hunter.\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nVerdict:\\n\r\nA good show, but it gets some praise that it doesn't deserve- it's pretty damn overrated.\\n\r\nIt is a pretty well written (for the most part) show with good themes and morals, with good fights and characters. Yes, it can get dreary and over-complicated at times but you can get over it from the entertaining characters and fights.\\n\r\nA major downside was.....the series didn't connect with me.  The story and characters, and the world (which is very extravagant and unique) wasn't very relatable and the entire series is nothing but fighting.\\n\r\nHell, the characters aren't even relatable if I'm being honest. We don't get to see them being real people if you ask me, we only see them fighting.\\n\r\nIf gon and killua and the rest were more fleshed out, the series would definitely be better. They are usually in situations where they have to fight people, it wouldve been nice to see them interacting in normal situations.\\n\r\nAnother problem for me was the lack of comic relief in the later arcs, and also in the chimera ant arc the show tried WAAAY too hard to be dark and edgy, it didnt feel natural.\\n\r\nBasically what i'm saying is everything I didn't like about the series was in the chimera ant arc.\\n\r\n If you want a series focused on battles, this may be the one for you.\\n\r\nHowever, the biggest flaw was the ending.\\n\r\nI know it wasn't the studio's fault but my god it is anti-climactic.\\n\r\nWhat happened to the zoldycks? Leorio? Kurapika? Gon? Gon's adopted mum? The phantom troupe?\\n\r\nWe shall never know.\\n\r\nHunter x hunter is not a masterpiece, or a special shounen which everyone claims it is, but there are a few things that make it special and differenciate it from other battle anime. Now you may think what i said about the negatives of the show are all bs, but remember, it's my honest opinion.\\n\r\nIf I only rated the first 58 episodes of the series I'd gladly give it 8 or 9 out of 10. However, since i need to take all of the arcs into account, my final score is 6/10.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10 (fair)\\n\\n\r\nArc ratings\\n\\n\r\nHunter exam 9/10\\n\r\nZoldyck family 6.5/10\\n\r\nHeavens arena 7/10\\n\r\nYorknew city 10/10\\n\r\nGreed island 5/10\\n\r\nChimera ant 3/10\\n\r\nChairman election 8/10\\n\\n\r\nPlease send feedback if you agree or disagree with my opinion on the show!",

            "content": "Heed my warning and heed it well: If you so choose to watch the gracious series that is Hunter x Hunter (2011), watch it well past the first few episodes. Though the first few episodes make the entire series as a whole seem bland, if you think this way, you're wrong and you should feel bad. Really really bad. Think of it this way: the series is a marathon runner. A good runner prepares himself and warms up for the long arduous journey ahead (ie. HxH). The bad runner carelessly takes off from the start with no preparation and eventually dying down halfway through becauseof poor preparation (ie. SAO, although the first half was somewhat enjoyable, the second half obviously sucked). HxH takes a while to be set in motion, but its part of winning the marathon. Preparation is essential. Listen, give yourself the first 25 episodes, and you'll see that it actually IS good and well worth your time -- and it gets much much much much much much much much much much much much much much much much much much better. Much better. In fact, I created an account with the sole purpose to explain why Hunter x Hunter is a must-watch.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I shall ACTUALLY explain....\\n\\n\r\nStory (10/10): Gon Freecss is a 12 year old boy, and an aspiring hunter with a taste for adventure. Sound familiar, eh? His father, Ging, left the newborn Gon, without leaving many clues to where the father had ventured to. Sound even more familiar, eh? Well don't assume that this is like any other cliched storyline, because it's far from it. Throughout his journey, he gains the acquaintance of Leorio (an aspiring doctor), Kurapika (a special-eyed boy enveloped in a deep vengeance for the killers of his tribe), and soon enough Gon's closest friend, Killua (a member of the highest skilled assassin-family, showing the most potential). Throughout the group's journey, each of the character's story play an essential role in driving the plot forward, and oh how the plot thickens.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is constantly evolving and constantly moving, sparing no slack in pace. If you hate filler, you will love this show especially. It will constantly keep you hooked. If you've just started the series, keep watching I tell you, keep watching. It keeps getting better.\\n\\n\r\nArt (10/10): Now I'm no art aficionado, but I can tell when too bright is too bright and too dark is too dark. All I can is that it's well balance and is pleasing to the eye. Now it's not seizure-inducing like NGNL, but it get's the job done in an enjoyable manner. The palette, uh, looks nice, and uh, stuff. Yeah. There's no \"you're trying too hard\" to be expected in the artistic representation of Hunter x Hunter. Edit: and once you get to the end of the Chimera Ant arc, I give you my solemn word: you will not be disappointed with the conglomeration of art and sound and the overall feeling. No spoilers.\\n\\n\r\n*Sound (10/10): Now this is my FAVORITE part. Part of what makes a series whole is the great sounds that go on behind it. I absolutely adore the music that went on behind the story. It did what I find other series have a hard time perfecting. When intrigue is being produced, music that correctly suits the situation will be presented, and in turn your intrigue will be piqued. When you're on the edge of your seat biting your nails, music adds to that experience. I believe it sets a tone for the story, and does it in an extremely efficient way. However, the only fault is that the music does not fit perfectly sometimes, but it isn't enough to irritate someone. It still gets the job done, and helps steep one's mind into the story further. And possible the BEST part of the sound portion of HxH is the inclusion of Gustav Holst's \"Jupiter\" from \"The Planets.\" It's a beautiful song and it's inclusion in the series legit made me shed a tear m8.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (10/10): No stone is left unturned in the realm of character development. Every character has a specific motive driving them and the drive to accomplish it. There's an explanation for every character's purpose -- and then it develops farther and farther. Think of Gon, the main character, as the main line. As Gon progresses, new characters come into contact with him, creating an infrastructure of development, moving forward at the same pace as Gon. The development only expands around Gon at the same time as Gon ventures about.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10): Need I explain my enjoyment further? The rating clearly declares my sentiment towards the series. The only thing that I DON'T enjoy is that the series is ending at only 148 episodes. That's right, only. By the time you go through the 145 episodes I've gone through, you'll feel how I feel to realize that there's only 148. 148 does not do this series justice. All I, as well as I'm sure anyone else who has ventured through the series thus far feels is that there should be more. and more. and more. and more. There's much more to be explored! Given, there are only 350 chapters (at the moment) of the manga, and the anime finishes quite close. My only hope, and I'm sure I speak for many others, is that the series picks up maybe even a year or 2 later, when there is more of the manga for the anime to run off of -- and not take 10 years to reboot and recontinue. All I can say is we want more, and more is an understatement.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR - Watch Hunter x Hunter (2011) past the first season, instantaneously become addicted, and see why this underrated series should be not underrated nor overrated, but rated with high regard. You will not be disappointed. Just watch it. 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nPS. People who give this show less than a 9 eat children.",

            "content": "I often see people complain about a lack of originality when talking about anime titles without giving it proper thought. The very idea of \"being original\" is within itself a fallacy, especially when referring to any form of storytelling. Everything in one way or another draws inspiration from something else and seeking out \"original\" content shouldn't be an end goal for viewers. What one should look for is how the content itself is presented. A typical story setup is only hindered by the writer and execution of said story. Proper execution and presentation can often be what makes or breaks a show. And even ashow with a formulaic setup can be refreshing if handled properly. \\n\r\nNowhere is this more evident than with Hunter X Hunter (2011). On paper it's a standard fare shounen with all the commonalities and tropes that you'd expect from the demographic. But when presented what we get is arguably some of the best materiel you can ever expect from a battle shounen. No it isn't a \"masterpiece\" like many would constantly proclaim it to be but it certainly reaches ambitious heights very rarely seen with a genre that is usually juvenile at best. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI'll try to refrain from reciting the synopsis:\\n\\n\r\nThe story, like I've already stated before, is nothing special. It can easily be summed up as character driven arcs with each core cast having their own objectives they wish to accomplish. What bring these individuals all together is the highly acclaimed job title of \"Hunter\". The title of Hunter, to save from a long winded explanation, are basically glorified Indiana Jones's positions. Receiving the title and getting the license to be one is like a VIP pass to do whatever the hell you want, may that be bounty \"hunting\", treasure \"hunting\", food \"hunting\", I think you get the gist of it. But the title itself is nothing but a means to an end and obtaining it is only the 1st step for our characters.\\n\r\nDespite Gon being our main protagonist, the story never neglects the core cast that befriends him. Through a given arc we as the audience get a shift in character focus depending on who the storyline corresponds to. Although Gon's journey still remains the overarching one, the others are properly fleshed out to stand on their own without including the MC.  For the most part anyway, unfortunately characters like Leorio never got his chance in the spotlight. With each arc and character focus brings it's own themes and conflict. May that be revenge and redemption as found with Kurapika's arc or self acceptance and discovery with Killua's. Each arc explores a given theme, which made the viewing experience to be more enriched. A balance was struck in it's presentation, making it heartwarming when called for it and awe inspiring when it needed to be. \\n\r\nThe world building and setting was another area that HxH excelled at. Everything felt well structured and was properly established. This is especially true for the show's fighting system known as \"nen\". It was extensively explained not only for the sake of the viewer but also to leave no room for asspulls that's normally common with shounens (looking at you Naruto asspull no jutsu). This intricate in-world power mechanics is only 2nd to that of FMA's mechanics behind alchemy. The various ways in which \"nen\" can be utilized led to some very interesting fights that was entertaining while being well thought out.\\n\r\nThe pacing for the series can be best described as a roller coaster ride. The beginning of the ride is simply a slow climb up to get the participant's blood pumping for the intense drop after they reach the summit. HxH knew how to properly set the stage before the main events happen, something many shounens tend to rush. Since we spend time establishing everything from the setting to the characters involved for the given arc, these well written buildup episodes are what help give certain events substance and weigh behind it. It wasn't just tension-less conflicts between characters, it became something that you got invested in. \\n\r\nOf course nothing is perfect and HxH had it's fair share of missteps. One noticeable one can be seen on an overview. While Gon's story tied most of the arcs together, looking at the content of each arc separately shows a lack of unification among them. They simply weren't thematically related or constructed. We go from tournament arc to revenge arc to \"stuck in a video game\" arc to killer creatures arc. There wasn't any core themes that brought them all together. The transition between them was fine but that never changed the fact that they never quite fit together.\\n\r\nAnother issue that arises was with it's themes. It felt like they could of done a lot more with the material presented. Prime example being the Chimera arc. they skimmed over it but never explored it.  They had the option to use the Chimera Ants in a allegorical way to display themes such as subservience, the human condition and Social Darwinism. Something similar to what they did in Shinsekai Yori and books like Animal Farm. Animals/creatures have always been the perfect proxy for those kind of themes but they never went that route and simply reduced it to cleverly written shounen fights. It was ideas that sounded good but went nowhere or was never brought up at all. No one's expecting a shounen with FMA's level of complexity but it would of certainly been a nice addition.\\n\r\nAlso something else that hindered HxH was it's conclusions. Nothing to do with what's presented itself but the limited material the studio had to work with due to the mangaka Togashi's infamous hiatuses. This results in an ending while satisfying, left many plot points and questions unanswered. The story still wraps up nicely but could of been more conclusive.  \\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nAnimated by Madhouse there should be little question of the show's integrity in terms of animation. Now it isn't anything to write home about or would leave you giving a standing ovation but what HxH have that most long running titles don't is consistency. From beginning to end it never had noticeable hiccups that distracted from the content displayed. It was brightly lit when needed and ominous during times that called for it. A show that knew how to manipulate its color palette to fit the tone of any given scene. And trying my best not to give away spoilers here but episodes like 36 and 116 were prime examples of this. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nPossibly the biggest highlight of the series comes with the characters themselves. If looked at individually very few warrant a character study but as a whole the interactions among them is what stands out. Everyone that's important to the narrative are all given a solid motive to which they strive for. They aren't simply stuck in supporting role, they take an active part in moving the story along. While many of them were fairly common placed archetypes some in particular were actually fleshed out and received actual development. Meruem for example being a character that experienced a catharsis which brought on change in his ideology and perspective in regards to the value of others. This may seem insignificant in other shows but in a genre that reduces villains to being bombastic 1 dimensional megalomaniacs seeing an antagonist with dimensions to his character was very refreshing. Killua being another rare exception for being a character that suffered from an internal strife and inferiority complex. This provided layered characterization to what would normally just be your standard badass. While Gon and a few others remained your dime a dozen characters their organic chemistry is what makes them stand out. (Oh and Hisoka is the best sadistic assassin ever, no this is not debatable, it's a fact lol)\\n\\n\r\nThis is a case where the whole was greater than the sum of it's parts. They were an endearing bunch that showed believable interaction among each other.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nHxH had its slow pacing during buildups and other issues thematically but it's certainly a show I thoroughly enjoyed. It's been a long time since I was ever immersed into a long running shounen and I honestly thought I had outgrew that demographic. But what HxH did that many failed to do was capture that sense of adventure and admiration I had when I was younger. It felt nostalgic, a feeling of familiarity that I only had as a child when watching Saturday morning cartoons. And to me that was well worth the investment.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nHxH is simply a rare breath of fresh air in a genre that has grown stale. It provided well thought out fights, contains a memorable cast and was thoroughly entertaining with lots of jaw dropping highlights. Of course it had it's issues but overall the title had a lot more going for it. As someone that has grown tired of shounens I was quite impressed with what HxH had to offer. It was engaging, it was potent and most of all it left me with a sense of satisfaction upon completion. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "HxH is one of the many overrated shounen anime out there and I can summarize my review with one sentence: \u201eIf you became kinda interested in HxH, because you have heard it\u2019s so much more than just a shounen, don\u2019t believe it, because it is exactly that, just another shounen.\" Now I\u2019m not a fan of shounen, and if you read this review you will find out why, so this anime is not made for me, but just for more diversity in views I will analyze this anime a bit closer.\r\nHxH is one of those anime where you can literally see the quality dropping, withthe earlier episodes being made nicely and at the end it has one of the longest pacings I have ever seen. Since the artstlye isn\u2019t in any form detailed and costly they can\u2019t tell me they ran out of money. I assume they just wanted to milk the cashcow to the end and stretch manga material of 20 episodes(in relation to the beginning) to around 60.\\n\r\nLike I said before the start of the show was quite nice. It had a few things which didn\u2019t really make any sense, especially the riddles, but it had a nice build up and a good pacing. It seemed to me as if the start also really wanted to surprise the viewers with something unexpected, regardless of how illogical it was. It also didn\u2019t do much good in terms of atmosphere, in some cases it even destroys the atmosphere it built up just for surprise reasons. The main characters are also unexplained overpowered, sure there are a few stronger but that alone doesn\u2019t justify a little kid being physically stronger than a well-trained grown up man, just because he \u201cgrew up in the woods\u201d, which is btw contradicted later on. But besides a few negative things to say, the start (first 17-20 episodes maybe) was ok. It had a goal and set motivation from the character side, the main story kinda made sense (more than the rest of the show) and they had some kind of, what the fans claim as \u201ctactics in fighting\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nIn the second arc the terror already begins. Motivations from the character were completely forgotten and not even mentioned in order to have a little conflict for the goal of this arc. The reason for the first arc and what they have achieved was completely pointless and even contradictory as explained in the later arcs. The following arcs shine with, not knowing what to call somethings. For the show an assassin is someone who is physically strong and can endure much pain instead of being stealthy and deadly, the so called \u201cmafia\u201d is a bunch of unorganized idiots who apparently have a lot of power (they at least have a lot of money) which is contradictory in every way and let me question the whole world building of this anime and we still don't know what a Hunter is and does. The writers have no idea of how money works, which wouldn\u2019t be a problem if they hadn\u2019t dedicated a whole arc just for money getting purposes, which later on is also completely useless. Not to forget the story is full of convenience, which goes beyond the acceptable amount.  Some of the arcs are complete filler since they either are pointless or have nothing to do with the final goal (the motivation of the main protagonist). There is even one arc were the main protagonist is inside a video game and literally the first thing he hears there is that being here is completely pointless, but he doesn\u2019t care and goes on anyway, which makes the whole arc pointless and questions the existence of the build up to it. \\n\\n\r\nThis show becomes less endurable from arc to arc, with the mafia arc being an exception but still not good. It\u2019s like comparing a pile of shit with a pile of shit which has a cherry on top of it. Seeing the later arcs lets you remember the earlier ones as if they were in any way good, that\u2019s how horrible this show gets. \\n\\n\r\nHunterxHunter also likes to copy or inlcude everything that was or is popular it seems. That goes from character design (Robocop) even to whole story arcs (the video card game arc which included cardgames like magic the gathering).\\n\\n\r\nA thing that really bothers me as well is the fact that this show has no scale what so ever. The abilities and the strength of every character are so completely random and out of order. It even shifts during the whole anime, making character who should be strong considering their rank utterly weak and character who should be weak unnecessary strong. Its like as if one writer wrote the hierarchy of all the characters and their relationship and then another decided, because how much he liked their appearance how strong they are. \\n\\n\r\nAll of the above was pretty much the first half of the show. The show was like I said very bad but had at least some arcs which were watchable and had a decent pacing. From episode 80 onwards the chimera arc takes place. This is basically the main difference between the original version of the HunterxHunter anime and the 2011 version. \\n\\n\r\nThe chimera arc is the worst thing I have seen in a long time in terms of writing. You can\u2019t take anything they say and do seriously, since the character design is so freaking retarded. They say they are ants but then a penguin and a pink panda in a suit is sitting there with them. NONE of the so called Ant-villains looks even remotely like an ant. The writers wanted to make this arc dark and mature but only showed how childish their writing is. Wow, characters are dying more often now, but that\u2019s about it with all the change they made. As if character dying = mature and dark. This is the most na\u00efve way of seeing it, but it fits a shounen. \\n\\n\r\nIn this arc HxH really shows how little time they spend with thinking through the whole thing. Where villains came from and what their motivation is was never a thing HunterXHunter spends any time in but in this case it makes absolutely no sense that some ant-people who just came into existence are able to be as strong as one of the strongest person in the whole anime. So again.. no scale existend. And with no time spend with motivation and personification the writers now believe they can put drama in the show when the villains die. Are you freaking kidding me? Yeah the ants just killed hundreds if not thousands of people and now I should feel sorry for them? The drama in this whole anime is the worst sort of melodrama, forced and reliable so much on double standarts. \\n\\n\r\nIn the last arc the tactics really shine, in terms of sucking. In the last 50 episodes there is only one fight anyways, so there is not much to talk about, but the tactics there is so utterly idiotic. There is so much bullshit that happened during this arc, there was not 1 episode where I wasn\u2019t facepalming. \\n\r\nBut all of the above would have been minor points if it wasn\u2019t for how boring this whole arc was. The reason I criticize their \u201ctactics\u201d is only because they spend so much time with talking and every fan thinks the tactics are so great. 90% of the time they talk about irrelevant stuff and when it comes to real tactics they are utterly bullshit, convenient or deus ex machina.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters of this show are not in any terms special. Have you seen either Naruto, One Piece, Bleach you know the personality of the main character. Add a bunch of extra typical side characters and you got them all. It\u2019s just the typical teenager character who is strong enough to change the world stuff.  In HunterXHunter they at least  didnt go full overpowered with the main character, but considering the age of the protagonist and the enemies he  is fighting later on I would say its pretty unrealistic. He is a very wish-fulfilling character and not that much of a role model. I think there is nothing really wrong with this wish-fulfilling kind of anime, but they are really nothing for people older than their demographic (in mind of course).  So saying this is more than a shounen is really wrong. \\n\\n\\n\r\nMusic is also pretty bad. All the good songs were copies of famous classical songs, such as Lacrimosa from Mozart\u2019s Requiem, the rest is rather forgettable boring background music. Artstyle is simple and character design in the WHOLE show is the worst I have ever seen, but that\u2019s ofc only my opinion. I found it to be nice to see no cgi, if I remember correctly. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSo overall: This show is not more than a shounen and I might add the worst written shonen I have ever seen, but I am not into that genre so I only saw a few of them. If you are a person who likes more mature stuff and think there is something behind this anime, otherwise it wouldn\u2019t be so popular, don\u2019t fall for the trap and stay away from it. At the end you will just regret it. \\n",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS\r\nOk, before you click on the not helpful button just because I rated this series a 7. Which from what I'm seeing the majority of reviews are dashing out 10/10 left and right. Time to have some variety in these hxh reviews. ;)\r\nFirst thing I'll have to admit is that when I first watch this series it was so goofy, Gon fighting with a fishing rod was such a turn off, I thought this series would be another fairy tale with no dark element in it, oh boy was I wrong. \r\nStory 7/10. The story  starts off with Gon and hissoon to be friends which are Killua, Kurapika and  Leorio who has set out a task of entering the hunter exam to be a official hunter. Now the story does branch off to other sub plots after they became hunters. For eg. Kurapika story which was in the Yorknew city arc, and imo was the best arc in the entire series, it had drama thriller action, interesting dialogue everything in it was perfect. The beginning of this series was quite slow and uninteresting, all the arcs I watch was just good nothing great or spectacular except for the Yorknew city arc, after the greed island arc the chimera ant arc came into play, and imo this arc felt out of place I didn't feel like I was watching hxh anymore, ants coming out of nowhere devouring people and wants to rule the world, so unoriginal. The pacing in the series started to drop the story in my honest opinion was not interesting each episode I watch in the chimera ant arc was just ok, nothing special. I did enjoy the Ikalgo episode though, the mind game was awesome in that episode, there were a few other good gem in the chimera ant arc as well.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10 The art in this series was really crisp and nicely drawn, I rarely saw the art being bad or having bad animation, I think madhouse  did a very good job in this series when it comes to the art.\\n\\n\r\nSound 6/10. This was the weakness part in the series for me, yes, there is some good soundtrack in it, but the majority of soundtracks imo didn't fit the atmosphere or scene of what was happening at the moment in the series. What makes the soundtrack even more disappointing is that they reuse the same soundtrack over and over in each episode. I think they needed more soundtrack for this series. The variety of soundtrack in this series was poor imo.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 7/10. The characters in hxh is good imo. Each characters have depth in them, the only person that felt one dimmensional to me was Gon, overall I can see why a lot of people liked the characters in hxh even the antagonist as well. Also Togashi did a good job in making us hear the thoughts of the characters even the villain as well, this gives them more depth and I think that was one of the major reason why a lot of people got attach to the antagonist in this series, me personally I didn't. The new characters in the chimera ant arc that are on the good side was just too much imo, and I wasn't interested in none of them, except Ikalgo.;) So when I was watching a episode focus on these new character I wasn't interested at all which made my experience unsatisfactory. Too much new characters were introduce at once in this arc.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10. This part is kinda tricky. I enjoyed this series but I also got bored to hell out of it as well, especially in the greed island arc and the chimera ant arc. I was bored to hell. But I think it was balance out. Some episode was just drag out and it felt like nothing happen the pacing imo got slow in the chimera ant arc, which took up the majority of this series, so it affected me a lot on the enjoyment part and also the overall of the series, plus you can factor in things like me not interested in the new characters or the lvl 1 ant characters, not talking about the royal guards if anyone is wondering, which our heroes did have to face.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7.5/10. Overall I had a blast with this series I started to watch it in 2013 so I came in late in this series. This series was overall a good series imo, if you notice I didn't say anything was out right bad in hxh, hxh did a good job in most of these categories, but for me it just did a good job not anything that will make me go \"Woah\" or anything extra ordinary, it was just a good series and it was overall good. I personally think this series is overrated just by seen the amount of 10/10 it's getting and also hxh looks like it will soon to be in the top 5 on mal. Any ways just like everyone else it's just a opinion, and I just wanted to share it with whoever is reading this.\\n\\n\r\nThnx for reading.",

No spoilers in this review.\r\n\tIt has been a long time that I watched an anime that evaluates and explores many aspects of the genre, especially coming from a Shonen demographic anime. While I started watching this series, I was skeptical from the anime by watching the first five episodes, considering that it brings a light-hearted, child-like feel. I stopped watching it for a while because it didn't bring any interesting I found captivating. As time passed by, I doubted myself for not even continuing this series. Many older fansof anime get thrown off by the demographic how anime such as Naruto, Bleach, One Piece, Fairy Tail,etc demonstrate a protagonist in search for glory to become someone important and known to others. Antagonists are shown later in the series soon later confronts the hero in a long-dragging, continuous fight. Eventually, the hero will overcome their goal during a long voyage of his traveling with their friends in either constantly wining in every single battle with their closest rivals, having a bigger ambition to accomplish to become \"someone\" important, or  making a difference in their power level in a outrageous moment while being in a ridiculous, near death, battle..These characteristics of what these series provided hindered me from watching a long, ongoing anime from predictable wins and losses from the Shonen heroes. However, one anime takes all these Shonen tropes and throw it out of the window. That anime is Hunter X Hunter.\\n\\n\r\nStory: The premise of the story takes us to a journey in Whale Island with our hero, Gon Freecss, a young 12 year boy who is destined to become a talented hunter just like his father, Ging, who is a legendary hunter known to many. Hunters are highly skilled professional fighters who have the exceptional ability to lure others into a trap at will, find uncommon creatures at sea or land, or search for undiscovered treasures.  On his quest, he finds other companions such as Killua, Kurapika, and Leorio who also strived to have the same goal to become the best hunter while they participate in the Hunter Exam. This appears to be like a typical, light-hearted Shonen premise in most cases. The pacing in the beginning of the series can commences very slowly for most people. This creates a hindrance with older audience who are used to Seinen type anime such as Monster, Berserk, Gantz, etc. However, gradually, the development of the story arcs within each episodes creates a further relationship between each character in a more complicated situations. While it appears to be a cheerful, humorous at first, it ultimately alludes how each story links up to create a further character development for a protagonist Shonen hero like Gon to overcome mentally and physically especially in the 6th arc of the series, the Chimera Ants Arc. Over the course of the episodes, the arc steadily deconstructs the elements of  the Shonen demographic into a true brutal, psychological nature of what it really means to be a hunter or even a human. As the story progresses within each episode, you will appreciate what the previous arcs has to offer in order to fully understand how the characters feel, hell even the villains' motivations and thoughts as well.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: Madhouse studio did an excellent job adapting Yoshihiro Togashi's (creator of Yu Yu Hakusho) long hiatus manga since 1998 into a more faithful anime adaptation. They keep up with the action orientated sequences fluid into constant beating from facial expression, anticipation, and even suspense. However, some older fans from the 1999 version may disprove of how \"colorful\" art style that the show presented from facial expression and animation wise. But, I'm not going to go into details with the flame war between two series from 1999 and 2011. They also meticulously improved the quality that the original manga drawing lack into a more vivid, watchable experience. For example, the character designs in the manga are considered poorly drawn due to Togashi's long hiatus since his sickness is very challenging overcome for years. This Conclusively, Madhouse excelled Hunter X Hunter manga into a more faithful adaptation it deserves story wise. \\n\\n\r\nSound/Music:  At first, the opening of the anime really suited to the atmosphere and how really addicted the song can really be. Even though the opening theme, \"Departure\" by Ono Masatoshi doesn't change arc after arc, the song becomes a tradition that really suits the mood of the show. It appeal repels me from watching every second of the episode that I couldn't stop watching episode after episode without knowing what is going to happen next. It brings such strong anticipation and curiosity to viewers what is the next moment is about to happen. The music sets the setting of traveling and exploring the world of Hunter X Hunter. It gives off how much is there in the world that is undiscovered. In the future,  people will looked back and feel nostalgic how the atmosphere suits very well in the HxH universe. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: This is where the anime leaves positive note on how well-written the character development really is. While Togashi was writing the manga his hiatus on the manga really makes the story more unique than most Shonen series I witnessed since they emphasis long term fights, rather than a thought-out character development. Gon and Killua are like yin and yang. They build a long, ongoing friendship through the series, learning and knowing their weakness they have to overcome. Not only the main characters have to conquer their own conflicts in each arc, even some minor/supporting characters get screen time in some episode so they wouldn't appear to have a very generic, one dimensional personality. Within each episode, the characters flesh out their morality from what is right or wrong. While in battle, the anime dives into their consciousness on how they can resolve the situation. Tactics and skills play a very important role in the Hunter X Hunter universe. You have to ask yourself, is killing your sworn enemy really going to bring satisfaction for everyone? Can your desire really lead to contentment for your own preservation? These questions lead you to think that the characters are not always what they seemed to be when you start to watch how they first interact each other.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:  Personally, I found this anime to be worth of my time, if not the best. Masterfully well-developed writing. Though-out tactics to weaken an opponent rather than random overpowered abilities for no particular reason. The only downside is the pacing might start off slow in the beginning, but Hunter X Hunter truly delivers what a classic Shonen anime can be without dragging its viewers into  unnecessary clich\u00e9. At first the show starts to grow as an innocent, cheerful child then it matures into a merciless, cold-hearted butcher regarding to the characters' dark past and essential role that will affect them emotionally and ethically later on in the series. Each have their own motives they have to undergo mentally. I enjoy every minute of humor yet complicated growth of each character the series has build to recent episode.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: The anime has surprised me in a so many ways that I just want more from its universe. As of today, the manga is on hiatus due to Togashi's back pains. Who knows when the manga is going to come back? Maybe in two years or even a decade from now. What we know now is that Hunter X Hunter is exceptional to the Shonen tropes that most common anime suffer from. After years of watching anime, I never witnessed of how unforeseen this anime can be from the same demographic as the big 3. For any one that is new to the anime, go watch it now. Be patient and you will gradually be rewarded for one of the best writing you will ever experience in a Shonen anime.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Whenever Shonen Jump releases anime based on a popular manga they are usually for the fighting and story enthusiasts. Hunter X Hunter is a show that balances the two perfectly in the form of a Yin-Yang.  Although this story is fiction, it\u2019s still based on some part of the truth of the real world we reside in. The story is brutal, deep, emotional, breathtaking and much more! A story that is different, but yet has the same basic elements you would expect from a Shonen anime. I won\u2019t go into details of the story or the arc because I can\u2019t mention that without spoilingbut I\u2019m going to express what I can in whatever words while keep it short and sweet. \\n\\n\r\nHunter X Hunter mainly focuses on a Young boy named Gon Freecss who like his father wants to become a Hunter. He wants to experience what the world of Hunters is like and why his father left him to attain the wonders of that world. You can say that Gon wants to look for his father and ask him this question and that sets a goal for the narrative for the anime. Now, with this type of narrative, the Hunter X Hunter universe sets itself to become everlasting much like One-Piece and Toriko, where various arcs can come about without going astray from the initial plot and connect each other with everything else within the medium. You can think of it as a programming flowchart that is always connected to the main command. What really sets the story apart from others is the way it\u2019s told. Its starts of slow, puzzling and full of questions but slowly starts to unravel itself and it gets really interesting as the arcs progress forward. Personally, no arc for me was boring. Every single one of them had something different and unique to offer from the introduction to new characters to foes and bros and new unexplored land which keep everything fresh and interesting. This is something that I feel makes Togashi-sensei such a spectacular author. Another great thing about the series is that Gon isn't the only main character of the series. There are a few more who are later introduced in the series which is what makes Hunter X Hunter special and different which hence makes more room for different types of arcs with different variations.\\n\\n\r\nAs you go deeper into the story you will see how complex, intriguing and thought provoking Hunter X Hunter actually becomes. A lot of the arcs in this show changed my perspective of how I looked at the world and the kind of potential it has of becoming, but at the same time it also made me think about the type of creation we are and negative impacts it brings to the table.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation and sound, this show probably has the most beautiful and the most precise animation I have seen for a long running series. The manga was very lucky to not have been picked by garbage studios like Toei or A-1, instead it was picked up by one of the best ones in Japan, Mad-House. Mad-House studio is known for its amazing animation and to have consistency in all of its long running 148 episodes is a feat. Animation is spectacular. Togashi isn\u2019t a very good drawer when compared to other manga artists but the anime comes and rescues that part of the story. As for OST, it\u2019s pretty good. There are tracks that are pretty awesome here and there and fit the mood perfectly. You will enjoy the animation and sound for this show. I follow some of the staff members who work on Hunter X Hunter at Madhouse Studios and they love this manga very much and they put a lot of effort to make it perfect.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, I know I\u2019ve praised this show a lot, but I feel there is no reason not because, as I see it, Hunter X Hunter is a masterpiece. It is slow to start off with like any other show, but once you get past the first few episodes, you will start to enjoy the show and that\u2019s mainly what hooks a person as he/she starts to gain interest. I always mention this is the reviews and tell people that fighting isn\u2019t everything in a Shonen manga/anime. Sometimes having a good story that keeps the audience at bay and keeps them guessing is what you need in a story and Hunter X Hunter delivers. Over the course of 3 years this show has become my favorite anime of all time and it was sad to see it come to an end. Sure the manga still continues (very slowly) but surely so I hope to see more of it in the future. With that I say good-bye to a spectacular anime which is a MUST watch for all!\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score:  Master Piece (10/10)\\n",

            "content": "What makes a show great? Is it the engaging story? Is it the interesting characters? Is it the immersion the show creates? I find myself always asking these questions whenever I start a series. Hunter x Hunter was no exception. I hadn't heard much when I first started it, but I had heard comparisons to Fullmetal Alchemist and Attack on Titan, both of which are some of my favorite shounens. Still, I had my doubts. \"148 episodes? How could there possibly be that much interesting plot without fillers?\" I asked. I was a fool.\r\nLet me tell you right now, 148 episodes is not enough. Iwould give anything for more episodes of arguably the most outstanding series I have ever had the good fortune of watching. \\n\\n\\n\r\nStory - I'm not going to go into detail about the story; you can read the synopsis for that. I'll instead talk about the storytelling itself. The story starts off fairly interesting and grows exponentially more interesting per episode/arc. The author, Togashi, has an amazing sense of pacing; some plots take several episodes to resolve, but so much happens in each episode that it becomes something that enhances the show. The story is also incredibly immersive because of how well Togashi builds the HxH world. As you follow the main characters on their journey, you learn more and more about just how expansive and unique the world is. There's always something new to explore, which really does make the show feel like an adventure.\\n\\n\r\nEach arc varies in tone. The show starts off pretty light, and gradually gets darker. My god does it get darker. Not to imply that the light arcs are inferior; they're still immensely enjoyable. The show just contains many different forms of entertainment. The darker arcs will include scenarios and scenes of such intensity, drama, and action, that you won't understand how anyone could've possibly waited a week for the next episode. Lastly, there's one element in the story that snuck up on me and transformed into something so beautiful and moving that I simply didn't know what to do with myself. \\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - There are very few ways to adequately describe how brilliantly the author writes such likeable, unique, and interesting characters. And I mean all of them. This is a rare kind of show where every time I see a character come back after not being around, I feel such joy seeing them. Especially the villains - you will love the villains so much that you legitimately will not know who to root for at many parts in the series. The show often develops villains so much that I found myself at times hating a \"good guy\" just because of what they did to a \"bad guy\".\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound - I know this upsets many people but I enjoy watching dubbed anime. However, this is on my short list of shows where the voice acting in Japanese is so good, I'm afraid of a dub being made because I honestly don't think the characters can be done justice. I'm even afraid to watch the original 1999 version because the voice actors are different.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the soundtrack, I don't have much to say. The soundtrack fits the show remarkably well, however there's nothing particularly outstanding about it (save for a few episodes, when a \"requiem\" is played for a certain character for example).\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nArt - The art studio Madhouse really brought their A-game. Their production of this show is almost paramount to how enjoyable it is. As great as the manga is, it wouldn't have been nearly as enjoyable without the stunning artwork and directing that Madhouse designed. \\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - This is pretty self-explanatory at this point. If I could erase my knowledge of any anime and watch it from the beginning, it would likely be this one. Hell, at this point I'd gladly watch 30 episodes of pure filler just to see more of the characters and the world.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nRegardless of the genres you enjoy, Hunter x Hunter is guaranteed to be a breath of fresh air. Togashi seems to have a penchant to subvert almost every trope and cliche in the book, leaving you guessing at every turn. The result is a brilliant and captivating piece of entertainment, guaranteed to captivate you like almost no other show can. Whatever your answer to the question \"what makes a series great?\" is, know that Hunter x Hunter has it.\\n\\n\r\nP.S. Hisoka is love, Hisoka is life.",

            "content": "\"You should enjoy the little detours in life to the fullest, because that's where you'll find things more important than what you want.\" - Ging Freecss\r\nHunter x Hunter 2011 is a unique beast of a show. It sits in a strange limbo between genres in a space all its own, like some kind of odd Chimera of shounen and seinen. At first glance it appears to be a rather childish show, with an art style composed entirely of cartoonish proportions, large eyes and bright colors, which stems initially from Togashi's manga style. In fact, without any outside input, one would not be wrong to assumeit was targeted at children. But under this initial layer of bright colors, and messages of friendship and loyalty, lies a deeper, darker show than anyone could have initially imagined. Questions of what it means to be human, what constitutes a life well-lived, and other topics that would not be out of place in serious adult dramas. One could say that I have stared into the abyss, and I am here to tell you that the abyss has most definitely stared into me.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 10/10. Story telling is really Togashi's specialty. He crafts a continuous and satisfying narrative from start to finish, with excellent pacing, lovable characters, and some entirely unexpected twists along the way. Characters aside, the story itself is fairly straightforward - Gon, the protagonist, wants to become a \"Hunter\" not for the benefits the title confers, but so he can find his father, who abandoned Gon as an infant so he could follow his own dreams (hence the name of the show - Gon becomes a \"Hunter Hunter\"). Along the way, Gon encounters a variety of characters that each have their own relative significance, makes friends and enemies, and undergoes any number of trials and adventures. But this straightforward story is presented and executed in such a way that it feels very organic and comfortable. This comfortable feeling serves as a waypoint during the darker points in the story, a lighthouse of sorts to guide one through the moral murkiness and sadness that the story presents. \\n\r\n          The story covers what is now a total of 7 story arcs, each with their own self-contained narrative. These arcs vary in length greatly - the shortest covers only 5 episodes, while the largest spans a time-consuming chunk of 61 total episodes - over a third of the entire show. But none of these feel out of place - each one seems to last only as long as it really needs to, and none of them feel as if they left too early, nor that they overstayed their welcome. Given that some episodes take 23 minutes to cover 5 seconds of in-world time, this is a marvel of pacing and narration. Some points are slower than others, particularly the beginning episodes of each arc, but at no point does it feel as if it is dragging. This is due in part to the complete lack of filler content - aside from one \"recap\" type episode, each episode of the show presents some kind of story-relevant material, so it always feels like the story is moving forward. All of these factors combined come together to create an overarching narrative that feels very much as if it were adhering to the quote at the top of this review - this is a show, and a story, that focus very much on the journey, the PROCESS of going somewhere, instead of on the destination.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8/10. Madhouse has always been hailed as a studio that produces high-quality work, and this show is no different. It is not always the pinnacle of visual quality, but like the story, the visual quality remains at a very consistent and pleasing level. At no point is it glaringly obvious that they neglected to spread the budget properly. High moments (i.e. the major fight sequences) have appropriately high quality, while those in-between sort of segments maintain a pleasing, but not excessive level of detail.\\n\r\n         My one main gripe with the animation of the show is the amount of time dedicated to hand-to-hand combat in the show. In a show that is predominantly about martial artists engaging in battles, there is a somewhat disappointing lack of choreography. Very rarely do you see two characters exchanging blows directly, even if both of them specialize in hand-to-hand melee combat. This is ultimately not enough to knock a point off of the score, but is something I would have liked to see more of.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8/10. Much like the art, the sound quality stays at a consistent and pleasing level throughout the entire show. Any complaints here are simply my own personal tastes, i.e. I don't very much enjoy the opening song that is used for the entire show, and some of the background pieces that play during the show feel sometimes out of place. But when the music needs to deliver, it does in spades.\\n\r\n          One thing I feel that is worth noting is that the show is obviously very aware of the value of silence. At a few points, there is no music at all, which, I feel, greatly increases the impact of these scenes. Very often now, we see shows that seem to feel as if music must ALWAYS be playing in the background, and when a show goes the opposite direction and uses silence, it creates a wonderful distinction.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 10/10. If the overall story is the bones of Hunter x Hunter, then the characters are the muscles and organs - the \"heart\" of the show. These are the elements of a story that allow us to connect with it personally, to draw parallels between the world that a story presents and our own reality. Inhuman or inorganic characters can completely break the immersion of a story, or if it presents characters that we dislike in a way that feels unrealistic. Togashi excels at creating likable and relatable characters, who each have his or her own (relatively) understandable motivations. The characters develop in a meaningful and noticeable way over the course of the story, lending them a definitively human feeling. Morality is very subjective in this show - very few characters fall into a black and white \"good vs evil\" morality. In fact, I would say that this show does not have a moral \"grey area,\" it has instead a \"moral rainbow,\" a multitude of different motivations and moral scales that interact with each other in an ever-changing spread of different moral hues. We see \"good\" characters exhibit emotional and perhaps even \"evil\" behaviors, while at the same time in a different place, our \"villains\" may be helping to save someone they care about, an action one would normally consider to be a \"good\" action. I would like to believe that this show does not have heroes and villains - it simply has protagonists and antagonists, two parties working in opposite, but equally understandable and justifiable directions.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10/10. I think it would come as no surprise that this is my verdict after the review above, but this is my place to reiterate that I believe this show is a masterpiece of storytelling. To have so many exceptional moments, emotions, and wonderful landmarks packed into 148 episode worth' of show is nothing short of spectacular. Togashi and Madhouse have worked together to create what I think is one of the best stories - not anime, not shows, but stories - of all time. Highly recommended.",

            "content": "Hunter x Hunter has always been one of those anime that looks amateur or goofy at first hand. Yet, behind those innocent faces is a classic tale of an adventure. Hunter x Hunter is more just about becoming hunters and being the best at what they do. Rather, it\u2019s a show about development with a cleverly written story wrapped with a colorful cast of diverse characters. For starters, Hunter x Hunter is a series that invites attention when it comes to storytelling. There are various arcs with characters that can easily be attached for their personalities, abilities, and most importantly\u2026class. As Hunter x Hunter isa shounen series, it\u2019s also an anime that develops beyond just the typical \u201csave the world\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nAdapted from the popular manga series written by Togashi, Hunter x Hunter (2011) is a remake of the original series. Now, it not only has more detailed animation quality but also expands on several arcs that never made itself debut on screen. \\n\\n\r\nThe story tells about a young boy named Gon as he strives to become a professional hunter and find his Father. During his journey, he meets protagonists including Kurapika (a young boy with a dark past), Killua (an assassin from the infamous Zoldyck family), and Leorio (a fellow Hunter candidate hoping to make a career from his journey). Essentially, the series details Gon\u2019s ambition to become a hunter. And to do that, they must go through the torturous Hunter Exam, a series of brutal tests that pushes the boundaries of survival and wit. While this also seems like good old fashioned fun, the series also expands beyond this and gets darker as well as more complex. The Yorknew Arc is a testament example of this as it takes on an unusually mature style of storytelling. The infamous Phantom Troupe (antagonists involved in the arc) serves as a driving factor to how dangerous the HxH world can truly be. Along with that, we also have Kurapika and his quest for revenge against the Troupe for what they\u2019ve done in the past. What makes the show shine itself in this particular isn\u2019t just by the growing more mature style of its presentation but by the driving factors. Surprising twists are revealed and the main characters gets intertwined in way that may change their lives forever. \\n\\n\r\nSimilarly, the Chimera Ant arc also adapts into a more mature style of storytelling. What makes this arc stands out also is not just the typical shounen style battles. Instead, it cleverly crafts its antagonists (the Chimera Ants) including its leader, Mereum, the King. Several of the antagonists undergoes unique changes and their dynamics is reflected by development through relationship building. Most prominently, Mereum\u2019s characterization blurs along the line between human and monster as his development is expanded by his interactions with a human girl. Additionally, Gon\u2019s inner desires to avenge a friend reaches a peak in this arc that will change his character forever. Along with that, the arc is notorious for its violence as blood is spilled, heads flies off, and limbs are blown to pieces. In one triumphant moment, the series pulls off a stunning moment that leaves almost every character shocked and speechless in their words. Maybe you might get that reaction too. With cleverly constructed dialogues and character building, the Chimera Ant arc goes beyond just a fantasy trope of \u2018invasive species taking over mankind\u2019.\\n\\n\r\nCharacterization is important and it comes in all shapes and sizes. The first instance is Gon, an energetic young boy with a whole lot of potential. His friendly demeanor earns him many allies including the cold-hearted Killua. Fearless and putting others before himself, Gon\u2019s true visage comes to his ability to keep a promise. Several instances in the series depicts him shooting for near impossible tasks. But it\u2019s important to realize at the same time that Gon\u2019s actions are not self-motivated but usually for others\u2019 sake. On the other hand, Killua comes off as a socially awkward boy with a head of mischievous ideas. Even so, he is a talented assassin having being trained from an early age in the art by his family. His relationship with Gon is a driving factor as the two becomes similar to brothers. This is very evident during one of the arcs when Killua plays on a very big risk to save Gon from death by consulting with a dangerous individual. Also interesting to note is the very family relationships he has with others. Killua\u2019s family is a group of assassins including his mother, father, and brothers. They treat him differently on individual basis as some sees him as the rightful heir of the Zoldyck name while others wants to control him. The most prominent relationship he has is perhaps with his older brother, Illumi, a talented assassin who has installed fear into the young boy. Throughout the series, it\u2019s interesting to note how Killua deals with the inner struggles of that fear. He faces against powerful opponents such as the Phantom Troupe and Chimera Ants. Sometimes, it feels as if he is fighting against himself when he struggles with his psyche. Nonetheless, Killua\u2019s family is more than just deadly as they held some influences on the young boy\u2019s life.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, not everyone has a family anymore in this show. Kurapika is perhaps a tragic example of this as his clan was murdered. Seeking revenge against the Phantom Troupe, Kurapika\u2019s desire to wipe them from the face of the earth goes to mind-breaking depths. Not only does he put himself in grave risk with his newfound abilities but also his friends as well. The way his character is depicted becomes something of an avenger as we witness how he matures from a professional hunter to a warrior seeking for redemption. As the final main character, Leorio plays more as a support to the team. His role is often overshadowed by the others. Yet, he is involved in several key moments throughout series that influenced deciding factors. I wouldn\u2019t call his role in the show as useless or stale though. Think of it more as lacking the \u201cIt\u201d factor. What this means is that while Leorio lacks moments that viewers will remember him by, his role in the show is noticeable when the push comes the shove. \\n\\n\r\nIn essence, the antagonists of Hunter x Hunter may seem stereotypical. However, it\u2019s easy to see that they can also be complex like a labyrinth. Characters such as Hisoka, Chrollo, and Mereum are prominent examples of this as their motives are often shrouded in mysteries. For instance, Hisoka (a serial killer and hunter) often plays life itself like is some kind of game. He always seeks out powerful opponents and hope that people like Gon would one day by strong enough to become a fruit to be \u201cripped. In certain ways, his role in the series can seem ambiguous as he sometimes tries to get in the way of the protagonists while other times assists them. In the end, it\u2019s all fun and games to the man as he toys with other people\u2019s lives for his own amusement. On the other hand, there are also antagonists that falls under a more stereotypical category such as the Bomber Trio during the Greed Island arc. Genthru, the leader of the trio, serves as an obstacle the protagonists must overcome. And as a sociopath, killing is no stranger in his vocabulary. \\n\\n\r\nHunter x Hunter also likes to play more on mind games but in a more logical way through conversations rather than a typical mind rape trope you might see in some psychological series. The final arc of the series (Election Arc) serves as a way to convey how certain characters talk in their style to characterize themselves and stand out in order to get what they want. Pariston, the Rat Zodiac, is perhaps the most prominent character of this as we see his role. But to say the least, the series\u2019 ability to command presence of this characters to the viewers is through its innovative concepts to adapt. Most of the characters in this arc are also shrouded in mystery. And through this background, viewers will become interested by the potentials they hold.\\n\\n\r\nThe series\u2019 fantasy style comes with in a variety of ways. The lavish lands such as the forest of the Hunter exam or the RPG gaming environment of Greed Island arc are examples of this. Similarly, it can rebound and become more civilized like a more modern setting such as the streets of metropolis of Yorknew City. Nonetheless, the show achieves its purpose by its ability to comfortably shift between settings without going off track. Similarly, the series has a battle system with Nen. Divided into six categories and heavily explored in the Heaven\u2019s Area arc, it follows this concept for the remainder of the series. It\u2019s easily understandable too without getting viewers to scratch their heads because the Hunter x Hunter shows, not just tell. And by doing that, it leaves behind an impression to viewers to understand and appreciate Nen and its ways. \\n\\n\r\nHunter x Hunter isn\u2019t without flaws. While the series is more complex than meets the eye, there are moments when it feels painfully indulging to get through. The first arc (the Hunter exam) may seem slow and dragging at times. Leorio\u2019s role in this arc may easily be forgettable while certain fights will be underwhelming. Certain characters may also be hard to take seriously throughout the course of the series and hard to understand. And while some of the antagonists may seem memorable, others can be a nuisance to get used to. This may even feature a few of the hunters in the show as their roles are diverged after their presence as compared to the main characters. Also noticeable is the repetitive OP song that never changes throughout the show. While this wouldn\u2019t be a problem at first hand, it can feel less appealing. Similarly, the pacing of certain arcs can feel slow. In fact, it can be slow enough that some viewers may distance themselves from the show to come back to it later. In retrospect, it breaks apart the strong development into a weaker focus. Oh and while narration wasn\u2019t a big problem for me throughout the series, certain viewers will find it distracting and needless as it drags out episodes; in particular the Chimera Ant arc. Nonetheless, this is a faithful adaptation of the manga so praise is definitely earned there. \\n\\n\r\nMadhouse is the brainchild behind the anime production qualities. While some parts may lack the classic feeling of the original series, the show\u2019s quality improves by its visuals. Certain scenes are enhanced or remastered to improved quality while others are expanded. However, the backlash might be their lesser faithfulness to certain parts to the manga. Nonetheless though, the series\u2019 quality improves as the show goes on. The character designs are also distinctive such as the case with Hisoka, members of the Phantom Troupe, and the Chimera Ants. Characters\u2019 designs also become more mature and complex such as the case with Kurapika. And as mentioned previously, the show\u2019s fantasy atmosphere is a like a breath of fresh air. Most welcoming of course.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack is decent although some parts lack appropriateness in the beginning and some bits later on. For most parts of the series, the soundtrack is strong and balances well between the comedy and serious moments. Emotional OST is also used during certain episodes to evoke feelings such as during the Phantom Troupe and Chimera Ant arc. Certain theme songs also fits their arcs well for overall impression.  While the OP song remains the same throughout the entire course of the show, the ED song undergoes through various changes. Most of them have its dynamic setup and the \u2018time to get it done\u2019 feeling. Similarly enough, the voice mannerisms of the characters deserves its praise for their portrayal. Their voices not just serves as representation of their characters but also their personalities and development. With such a development, no wonder Hunter x Hunter is more than just a classy shounen.\\n\\n\r\nThe endgame of Hunter x Hunter is not just its battles. In fact, most of the battles aren\u2019t very long or featured as the highlights (except in some cases in a few arcs). Rather, it\u2019s by the structure of its well written story and unpredictable plot twists that will really suck you in for its delivery.  The characters are complex with a style that is unparalleled when it comes to characterization. Not only do the main characters get spotlights but certain antagonists will also be memorable for their roles and development. And with Madhouse being at the steering wheel, you can expect this show to be worth every minute of it.\\n",

            "content": "After years of everyone from personal friends to random internet commentators imploring me to watch Madhouse\u2019s 2011 adaptation of Hunter x Hunter, I finally got around to it. I was told that this was the best long-form battle shounen out there, avoiding all the sins of mediocrity of other Shonen Jump titles like Naruto, One Piece, and Bleach commit. I was told Hunter x Hunter did not constantly try to implausibly escalate the stakes of each battle, didn\u2019t rely on boring clich\u00e9 motivations of characters just wanting to get stronger for no reason, did not draw out its battle sequences for outrageous lengths of time,did not include random unnecessary filler. When I looked more into it and saw that its animation was far superior to anything I\u2019d seen of a similar length, and that it was in the all-time top 5 on MAL. I came into it with somewhat high expectations. I was not expecting a masterpiece, but at least a competently written and directed series that would outpace the mediocrity I\u2019ve come to expect of this genre.\\n\\n\r\nIt turns out, I must not be in on some elaborate inside joke or meme. After sitting through 148 episodes of this I do not see how anybody over the age of twelve could impartially think this series is anything special. The bottom line is this is one of the most completely incoherent, unevenly paced, poorly thought out, and generic series I\u2019ve ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nI suppose I\u2019ll start with my positive notes about the series. First, the animation is noticeably better than just about any series of this length. It got a little slipshod for moments around episodes 100-120 with ill-fitting CGI thrown in now and then, but started and ended strong and was never unnervingly bad. My biggest complaint about the artstyle, which has way more to do with the source material than Madhouse\u2019s artists, is that the character designs are not coherent with each other. With a few exceptions (eg., Hisoka, Biscuit, and Palm) they look fine, but it looks like they were all ripped out of completely different series. However, I suppose that\u2019s a sign of things to come as the plot is also an incoherent mess that feels like several different series randomly crammed together. Another positive note is that the soundtrack which is actually rather exceptional, almost ill-fittingly so considering how weak the series itself is. However, various tracks were over-used and ran somewhat hollow towards the end. Overall, the soundtrack might have been the best point of the series. The voice acting is mostly adequate, with Mariya Ise\u2019s performance of Killua really standing out. I would recommend avoiding the English dub for the most part (I watched about half of the series dubbed), some side characters have really shoddy and obnoxious actors.\\n\\n\r\nThere are also redeeming aspects of character development and plot progression. For the most part, all that stuff I was told about it avoiding the sins most other shounen commit was true for the first sixty or so episodes. The first few \u201cfight\u201d scenes actually felt like refreshing deconstructions of what is so annoying about most shounen fight sequences. For an example, a character would start up some annoying cliched banter about how powerful he was and how he couldn\u2019t be beaten like most scenes from Naruto only to be shut up by a punch in the face. It felt refreshingly well-paced in the first three or so arcs, the main cast of characters were rather endearing, and there was little in the way of boring filler.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, even in the early episodes, it never felt like anything special. I was enjoying it well enough and could see why some people really liked it, but it was somewhat generic and far from a masterpiece. The first arc was a fairly typical exam-style arc, very similar, for example, to the chunin exams in Naruto. It revolves around our main character Gon trying to get a Hunter license through an extremely difficult exam involving a wide variety of off-the-wall, unrelated tasks. The main point of this arc was to acquaint viewers with the main cast of characters and introduce the notion of what a \u201chunter\u201d is. \\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s Gon, a rather endearingly na\u00efve and ambitious 12-year-old trying to earn a Hunter\u2019s license so he can meet his father who abandoned him as a child; a clich\u00e9d lead for a shounen, but adequate. Kurapika, a somewhat ill-tempered but driven character bent on getting revenge for the murder of his people. Leorio, a stock comedic relief character with a somewhat compelling backstory hinted at early on but never explored. Easily the best character of the series is Killua, a 12-year-old former assassin who becomes best friends with Gon early on who is trying to escape his family\u2019s will to turn him into an assassin. Killua and Gon\u2019s friendship (that, at times, arguably verges into canon romance, at least from Killua\u2019s perspective) is really the highlight of the series. Killua\u2019s dark and brooding demeanor, as well as his high skill-level, acts as a perfect counterbalance to the charming but comedically stupid naivety and innocence of Gon. The way Killua is constantly trying to prove to himself that he\u2019s good enough for Gon was the only consistently good character dynamic that kept me watching through this series\u2019 most painful moments. The last notable and memorable character from this early sequence is Hisoka, a wildly underdeveloped possibly pedophilic clown who seems only motivated to someday fight Gon because he wants a challenge (we\u2019re getting into really boring shonen clich\u00e9s) and acts as the series only consistent antagonist, even when he helps the main protagonist. But at least he\u2019s somewhat entertaining with how off-the-wall he is.\\n\\n\r\nTowards the end of this arc, though, you realize that it accomplishes almost nothing in the way of interesting world-building. You realize about fifteen episodes in, with some dismay, that \u201cHunter\u201d is just a term for a generic action-hero mercenary. It mostly turns out this exam is little more than a disconnected variety game show. But, hey, at least the characters are somewhat compelling, if a little bland, and the games are somewhat interesting. At this point, I was still optimistic and I found myself thinking if they flesh out these main characters other than Killua a bit more this could get good.\\n\\n\r\nAs you get into the second arc, the series begins to go a little stale and it becomes really clear just how lazy and bland the supposed worldbuilding for this fictional setting is. After a few episodes of rallying Killua back from his family, which served for some interesting character building, the main four characters split up. Killua and Gon participate in another shonen clich\u00e9 of a battle tournament to get money, as well as pawning some antiques on the side, to obtain a video game that somehow has some hint as to how to find Gon\u2019s dad. The main point of this section is to engage in some worldbuilding around the use of aura and nen\u2014the main fighting mechanic of this series. It renders the first series mostly useless since it turns out obtaining the Hunters license didn\u2019t mean anything, meaning the notion there is not any unnecessary filler here was a lie. The fighting mechanics are overexplained at times and is a rather typical plot device for a shonen, but it gets the job done. This is one of the more boring and forgettable sections of the series, and that is saying something considering the tedium to come. \\n\\n\r\nMore interestingly, Kurapika begins to try to enact his revenge plot against a gang called the Phantom Spiders and we get some interesting development of his character. Eventually, the two subplots of Gon and Killua training and Kurapika getting revenge dovetail as they try to stop the antagonists from robbing. The video game angle is forgotten for about twenty episodes, just one of many times a key plot point will be randomly dropped. Oh, and now Leorio is mostly forgotten, a sign of stupidity to come as he and Kurapika\u2014two of the only compelling main characters\u2014are about to be completely forgotten for nearly 80 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nWhen Gon and Killua finally obtain their video game, the \u201cGreed Island\u201d arc starts. Here, it becomes clear that this is far from what I was promised. Greed Island is easily the worst arc I\u2019ve ever seen in any shounen anime. The basic premise of this is basically the bastard child of Yu-Gi-Oh and Sword Art Online but somehow manages to be worse than both. Almost everything that happened in the first few arcs is completely forgotten, Gon again gets completely distracted from the goal of finding his father and gets sidetracked with the game and another random unnecessary training sequence. Killua acts completely out of character throughout this arc and is almost as na\u00efve as Gon suddenly. Almost every other character from earlier in the series is entirely absent, and an entirely new cast of characters is introduced as well as an overexplained, convoluted new plot device of a stupid card game. The phantom troop from Kurapika\u2019s arc shows up for a minute for no good reason and is then promptly forgotten and Hisoka plays a big role but acts way out of his previously established character.\\n\\n\r\nThe early part of this arc is a bunch of boring exposition spoon-fed to the viewer through badly written explanatory dialogue that needed to be done because the arc had nothing to do with anything before it. This really points to the problem of having such a completely incoherent, unrelated set of arcs: the viewers\u2019 time is wasted with a bunch more exposition when nobody really wants tedious explanation 60+ episodes into the series. It is really reminiscent of how dreary the filler arc at the end of the original Naruto was\u2014but at least those filler serials made some sense most of the time, this arc was as convoluted and nonsensical as it was dull. The worst thing is during one of the most outrageously stupid moments in the history of shonen, a battle revolving around (of all things) dodgeball, all the worst clich\u00e9s of mediocre shonen I was told Hunter x Hunter avoided were on full, proud display. The basic rules of dodgeball are boringly overexplained through narration eight times, the fight scene drags on for far too long, an emotionally-driven power-up by Gon is what ultimately won it, and the antagonist for the fight was built up using boring tropes (such as defeating other characters previous built-up as strong instantly). The main antagonists for the arc were completely boring, unpredictable, and underdeveloped. I barely made it through this arc and almost dropped the series altogether, but was told the next arc was better.\\n\\n\r\nLike the theme song I was now growing weary of told me, \u201cthere definitely is a good reason to persevere,\u201d so persevere I did. Turns out, just like my friends did when they told me this was the best shonen ever, that was mostly a lie. The Chimera Ant arc\u2014which takes up about 40% of the series\u2014was better from the start, but wound up being so horribly executed that it was really frustrating to watch. Killua\u2019s character got some important development with his relationship to Gon. A new rival for Gon\u2019s attention acted as a good foil to Killua. A little bit of somewhat interesting world building is accomplished. I was now really noticing how horridly lazy the worldbuilding was. Apparently the world map is just a flipped version of a real-world mercatus projection, but hey it\u2019s something. Again, this arc has almost nothing to do with anything that came before it, an entirely new cast of characters are introduced, and we\u2019re exposed to even more exposition. However, at least the exposition is somewhat enjoyable this time around. The premise of this arc is that a bunch of killer humanoid ants are killing everyone in one country to try to give birth to a new king, and Gon and Killua join some old friends of Gon\u2019s father to stop it. The antagonists this time around are by far the most interesting and dynamic of the whole series and provide interesting external commentary on human societies. The premise is interesting, it was paced slower but felt well-executed, it was thematically interesting. Around episode 95 I was thinking this series might redeem itself.\\n\\n\r\nThen, the main battle sequence starts and the so-far passable Chimera Ant arc completely jumps the shark. A whole bunch of characters we only got vague backstories on twenty to thirty episodes earlier are suddenly super important so its hard to keep track of what\u2019s going on. The battle sequence is now so drawn-out it makes Dragon Ball battles seem snappy. Seriously, a good twenty episodes into the big important climatic attack on the antagonist, the narrator announces only three minutes have passed. Speaking of the narrator, that\u2019s the worst part about this arc. \\n\\n\r\nAlmost every damn moment of episodes 100-120 is taken up by horribly written, contrived narration. Every move in the battle, every psychological state of every character is just spoon-fed by the narrator. It\u2019s not like the directors were incapable of subtlety, most of the narration was completely unnecessary since Madhouse actually did a decent job at subtley portraying battle techniques and emotional dispositions (although the animation through this arc was the worst of the series). The moment you almost get into the atmosphere of a scene during the battle, the narrator\u2019s there to break the fourth wall and ruin everything, destroying any emotional depth that could be salvaged. The whole point of a visual medium like a television series is to show us characters\u2019 dispositions, motivations, and beliefs, or even the basic events of the plot, not just tell it to us. Otherwise, we might as well forego every single film adaptation of novels and stick to audiobooks. For the most part, this sub-arc felt more like an audiobook than an anime.\\n\\n\r\nWorse yet, the events at the climax of the battle are as implausible as they are ridiculous. Gon\u2019s happy and na\u00efve character fantastically changes way too quickly in to a bloodthirsty sadist during another revenge arc (because Kurapika\u2019s been forgotten for about 80 episodes) as he seeks vengeance for another minor side character we\u2019ve barely gotten to know. The battle hilariously escalates into ridiculousness. Character designs become downright stupid (at one point the antagonists turn into chibis and Gon looks like handsome Squidward with impossibly long hair), fights between minor side-characters we do not really care that much about are drawn out into three episode sequences, and things escalate beyond credulity.\\n\\n\r\nWhen all the dust is settled, eight or so episodes are spent on the resolution to this arc. There are flashes of brilliance here and there, and you\u2019re thankful the narrator has finally shut the hell up. The most notable moment is the finale for the main antagonist of this arc, Mereum, which was probably the best directed scene of the series. It was so high-quality it felt out of place since the animation quality dipped during the battle. Other than that, there were a bunch of scenes that were supposed to be emotionally charged, but so many characters were introduced 30 or so episodes ago with little development in between the viewer is mostly spent struggling to remember who was who and wondering why she should care. It\u2019s a shame, this arc had a lot of potential but it was wasted on fantastically dumb battle sequences and contrived narration to shoehorn in as many new characters as possible rather than actually focus in on the few compelling characters and events in the arc. The most notable half-delivered promise of this arc was the rather rushed development of the main antagonist Mereum which was incredibly compelling before the battle. It\u2019s amazing how the most drawn out section of this anime managed to rush even the most important parts, like Gon\u2019s dynamic change in his quest for revenge or Mereum\u2019s battle between being an ant and a human. But hey, at least they didn\u2019t just randomly forget key characters and plot elements from this arc like they did everywhere else.\\n\\n\r\nThe final mini-arc is when this series just got extremely tedious, boring, and entirely unenjoyable\u2014even more tedious than the drawn-out battle sequence. Gon is injured from the big fight, Killua needs to go retrieve his sister who has some special power to heal him\u2014who at this point we\u2019ve never met and have no clue why Killua cares so much for her if he\u2019s never mentioned her but I guess expecting basic narrative coherence was out of the question at this point. This would be fine, except it keeps getting sidetracked with this tedious political drama about the Hunter organization trying to run an election which is mostly extremely dull bureaucratic dialogue with a bunch of crudely designed characters we\u2019ve never met before who are introduced in a rushed fashion. Remember that infamous scene from the Phantom Menace where they sit in the Galactic Senate talking for too long? Imagine that for about six episodes worth of content. It\u2019s miserable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nIt ends on a higher note. The stupid election bureaucracy fizzles out and it turns out to have mattered even less than we thought it did. Gon gets reunited with his father, which is nice enough. There\u2019s a lack of satisfying resolve in Gon and Killua\u2019s friendship, but after the last 90 episodes of mediocrity, the last 3 or so were stronger. I suppose Madhouse deserves some credit for wrapping up an unfinished manga with a plausibly fulfilling ending.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I do not really know why anyone takes this series all that seriously. This only deserves a small fraction of the hype and critical acclaim it gets. Maybe people are so desperate for a competently animated long-form shonuen that is less than 500 episodes they\u2019re willing to overlook the deep flaws in this show? It feels like a completely incoherent Dungeons and Dragons campaign run by a bunch of ADHD 11-year-olds on crack. Maybe you like the off-the-wall style of storytelling and the way it constantly and implausibly ups the ante on your willful suspension of disbelief. But even if so, it is downright frustrating when key characters and plot points are completely forgotten, when you have to sit through exposition after exposition, or when battles get as drawn out and clich\u00e9 as they do in this series. The only reason it\u2019s not getting a lower score is because Killua is a uniquely memorable and well-developed character, the first 50 or so episodes were at least enjoyable, and it does deserve some credit for being much more visually polished than most of its peers.\\n\\n\r\nConsider how Hunter x Hunter with other long-form battle shounen that are notable for their mediocrity even during its most successful arcs . Compare it to, for example, Naruto or Shingeki no Kyojin. What keeps me hooked on a series like Naruto or SnK despite how deeply flawed they are is that they have coherent, well-defined and interesting worlds into which I can get somewhat immersed. If I\u2019m investing more than 100 episodes in to a series, I want to get lost in the world. I can tolerate implausibly high-stakes battle sequences where the main character is just screaming like in SnK if the setting is interesting and the premise is compelling. I can sit through bland exposition of a new larger cast of characters 200 episodes into Naruto Shippuden if I get a sense of how they fit into the larger narrative in world. \\n\\n\r\nSure, when Hunter x Hunter is at its best in the first third of the series it avoids some of the most glaring flaws of those shows with ridiculously drawn-out battle sequences, spoon-fed explanations, and constant escalation issues. However, it has no sense of immersion or coherent world-building at all since the setting and premise is so generic and never fully fleshed out, and when there\u2019s an attempt to give a sense of setting the elements randomly pulled out of someone\u2019s ass on the spot with contrived narration and usually contradicts whatever came before it. Even the city names are generic, lazy knock-offs like Yorknewcity or Pajing. Gon\u2019s main attack is based off rock paper scissors, for Christ sake. The result in Hunter x Hunter is when the few interesting main characters are absent and I\u2019m forced to sit through more exposition of new characters and battle techniques or when it begins to fall into those bad shonen battle clich\u00e9s during the Chimera Ant and Greed Island arcs, I just lose all sense of interest and watching the series becomes a dull exercise in perseverance. Ultimately, that lazy world-building and lack of coherence makes Hunter x Hunter even worse than most of the mediocre shounen to which it is favorably compared. Paired with the way key points are just dropped and forgotten for good and the cast of characters becomes so large and rushed, the whole series becomes downright frustrating.\\n\\n\r\nAt its best, Hunter x Hunter is a rather unremarkable battle shounen with a handful of memorable characters. At its worst, it\u2019s a completely incoherent, tedious, barely watchable mess. At any given moment, it could be anything between those two extremes. Even though there are a lot of enjoyable moments and some good characters to salvage from the series, I have a hard time recommending this to all but the most hardcore of shounen fans.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 1/10\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10\\n\r\nOverall 4/10",

            "content": "A 10/10 review for Hunter X Hunter 2011 is nothing new on this website: plenty of people have already eloquently described what makes the show such an incredible experience, and for that I'm glad. The show deserves all of the praise that it receives. The reason I decided to write this review, however, was not merely to explain what makes the show so great, it's to convince you to try to watch it. If you're anything like me then the fact that Hunter X Hunter has 148 episodes can be a little daunting: that's a hell of a commitment for a single story. In conjunctionwith this, the show's kiddy art style and first few episodes don't really seem to be indicative of a higher level of storytelling. To top it off, all of those gleaming reviews are a bit of a double-edged blade: going into anything with such high expectations can ruin the experience, and many solid shows have been brought to their knees by over-enthusiastic fans who build them up to be more than they could ever hope to be.\\n\\n\r\nI had all of these doubts when I went into the show. I usually stay away from anything longer than 50 episodes, I didn't believe that anything truly compelling could be spawned from Hunter X Hunter's sugar-coated beginnings and that the show was getting a lot of credit just for having zany ideas and a good sense of humor, and I had heard both strangers and people I respected tell me over and over again that this was the one: the fantasy epic that did it right, that only continued to get better over time right up until its stunning conclusion. If you're feeling any of those reluctances, if you've started the show and just can't seem to be able to get past the first few episodes, know that I was right there with you. Even as the show's first arc came to a close I still didn't consider it to be anything more than \"well thought-out fun\". But dear reader, I URGE you not to fall into that pitfall. I URGE you, if you have any fondness for the world of Hunter X Hunter, if there is any inkling inside you that says \"I might be able to dig this\", PRESS ONWARDS. The reviewers are right and the legends are true: Hunter X Hunter delivers one of the most sprawling, powerful stories of all time. It went in directions I hadn't even considered. It was one of four shows to ever force tears out of my eyes. It delivered powerful stories time and again, and it tied everything together with a conclusion about the meaning of life itself. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the review itself, it seems cheap to merely ride off of the backs of other reviewers, no? Let me give my own two cents at what makes this masterpiece so compelling.\\n\\n\r\nHunter X Hunter is a shonen. It's several tiers ahead of every other shonen I've watched, but it still does have a focus on battles and conflict. What sets it apart is that there's actually usually very little animation involved in the Hunter X Hunter fights: instead of showing the fast-paced high-energy showdown of two characters from the point of view of a third party, Hunter X Hunter takes the internal route. It shows the thought processes of the characters throughout the course of the battle and it makes sure to lay down a tangible battlefield so that you can understand exactly what's happening. Tactics and experience play a HUGE role in combat in Hunter X Hunter: strength doesn't prevail by itself, it's the ability to put it to creative use that makes the victor. Psychological warfare is also a common strategy, with combatants using attitude and knowledge about their opponent to get opponents that may hold huge advantages over them to make stupid mistakes. People don't just fight for the sake of it in Hunter X Hunter: they fight for discernible reasons, whether it be to protect someone or avenge someone or out of pride or stubbornness or fear, and the motivations behind every conflict often play a role in the outcomes themselves. Speaking of which, Hunter X Hunter isn't really all about the \"who wins\" part of fighting. It is rare that it resolves story arcs in straightforward and clean-cut ways, always choosing to honor the choices its characters would make over whatever expectations people may have. This can lead to surprisingly happy and simple resolutions, or it can lead to a morally convoluted clusterfuck that seems to fall apart more than it does resolve itself. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves are one-of-a-kind: in part, this is due to the undeniable uniqueness of their personalities and character designs. However, it's also due to the show's respect for each and every one of the people it introduces. Hunter X Hunter is a forgiving world, where assassins can become heroes and serial killers can command respect and rise to the top. But it's also a harsh one, where people's misguidance can have disastrous consequences and where virtues can be a double-edged sword. In it, everyone has a voice, a goal or goals, a chance to make a difference. Whether it be a previously undeveloped face in the sea of Hunter Exam applicants or an octopus sniper that just happens to be stumbled upon, there are no extras or standbyers in Hunter X Hunter. The ideals of its central protagonists are valued no more than anybody else's, and stories are created and resolved not through convenience but by the show's immense living breathing cast. Each character's story is their own: whatever they may achieve during their time in the show, they have no obligation to stick around for the next phase of the story if they belong somewhere else, and they have no obligation to resolve any of their personal struggles just because the main protagonists are there. Those are something for them to figure out in their own time. What this does is it creates a world brimming with energy and passion, a world where you find yourself simultaneously invested in an unbelievable number of characters because they all feel like individuals, a world where you're constantly on the edge of your seat to see what happens next because 'convenience' has been kicked to the curb. This isn't to say that the show's main protagonists aren't important: quite the opposite, it is their brilliant character arcs that sell the show's ending and create some of the show's most powerful moments. However, the show never gets swallowed by them and it never gives them any more influence on the outcome than they deserve.\\n\\n\r\nThe execution of the show is constantly top-notch as well. Animated by studio Madhouse (famous for shows like Death Note and always able to adapt to the tone of any show), Hunter X Hunter looks absolutely pristine for the entirety of its 148 episode run. It uses crisp, clean lines, bright colors and an indescribable glow to its shots that elevate it in the visuals department while making sure that it has its own unique style: it isn't just \"pretty\"; I could recognize a screenshot from Hunter X Hunter in an instant even if it had no distinguishing characters or story elements in it. The sound is great: the show uses the same opening for the entirety of its run, and oftentimes uses slow instrumental versions of it for the OST during the episode as well. The soundtrack is for the most part a series of the same few songs redone in different ways for different moods, but when the show shifts gears later on into a far grittier and unprecedented arc the soundtrack shifts entirely to reflect the changing protagonists and the alien situations they are now finding themselves in. The voice acting is superb, with a cast that nails the fun and breezy feel of the show but is wholely capable of turning up the intensity when shit goes down. I place an immense value on the literal written dialogue of a show: not just the story or the thoughts behind the characters, but in the way that they interact and their thoughts are portrayed. In this regard more than anything, Hunter X Hunter exceeded my expectations with a script that never dragged and was comfortable and natural switching from long-winded explanations to well-delivered humor to drama and existential woe. Some of the show's most powerful scenes owe themselves to the writing, using just the right words in the right ways to convey what was trying to be said.\\n\\n\r\nDid I love watching Hunter X Hunter? Absolutely. Would I watch it again? Absolutely. Would I recommend it to anyone with even the slightest inkling of a desire to try it? Absolutely. There's only one thing you need to enjoy Hunter X Hunter, and that's an open mind. If you go into its lucrative antics, nonsensical world and over-the-top characters and conflicts with an open mind, you will find one of the most compelling, tragic, powerful and ingenious adventure epics of all time, full of heart and unforgiving to anyone who fails to recognize that the greatest treasure in life is the road one takes on the way to where they are going.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want to see a far more in-depth examination of my thoughts on Hunter X Hunter, I have a spoiler-ridden blog post on my page where I'd be happy to discuss the show with anyone.",

            "content": "My review will start with a short version free of any spoilers, followed by an in depth review containing some minor spoilers.\r\n-Quick overview- (no spoilers)\r\n  To me HxH was a very average anime in terms of my overall enjoyement, with some amazing qualities but also some stinkers. My biggest issue going in to HxH was probably my expectations. A couple friends I had met on an MMO reccomended it to me, calling it the best shonen of all time. At this time I had already finished naruto and bleach, and was up to date on One Piece, all of which i rank 9 or10 out of 10, so my expectations going in were about as high as they could be. I was SORELY mistaken. To me, HxH falls short of the above mentioned Shonen in just about every aspect, especially fights (which for a battle shounen is a big grading point). HxH's strongest aspect, the only area i think it matches the quality of naruto, OP or bleach, is in it's character design. There were some AWESOME characters whom i would of loved to of seen more of.\\n\\n\r\nIn summary, if you go into it without expectations I find it enjoyable but overall average, with the amount of narration in later arcs, and characters from later arcs diminishing my enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\n-In depth review- (spoilers)\\n\r\n HxH was a little slow at the start for me, as is any good anime over 100 episodes. However quickly into the first arc, the hunter exams, they had my interest in full swing. There wasn't anything spectacular in the way of fights, or interesting powers, but they did what any long anime should start with in my opinion; building backround on interesting characters. By the end of the second miniature arc, the journey to the house of Gon's new found friend, killua, I could see HxH potentially being as good as my personal favorite shounens. Killua, his family, gon's dad, chairman netero and hisoka were all SPECTACULAR characters and I was interested to learn more about them and see them in action.\\n\\n\r\nFast forward through to the York New arc, my favorite in the series. Here you are introduced to more members of the phantom troop, almost all of whom I found just as interesting as killua, hisoka and the others mentioned above. This arc is also where the anime started turning dark, but in a tasteful manner, not just a dumb gore-fest for the sake of just cuz, like in the matter of elfen lied.\\n\\n\r\nAnd this is where the anime started to spiral down for me, from an easy 8 or 9 out of 10, down to a 5 or 6. The arc following York New, Greed Island, was hands down one of the most boring arcs I have seen in any anime that I actually enjoyed. The main villain being an all time low for me. His appearance, dialogue and personality were all just very disappointing to me. His one up side, his semi-cool power to blow up things he touches, is then turned flat out stupid, by making it so that he has to explain his power to people for it to work on them. Also while were on the topic of powers, theres this concept of \"self imposed contracts\" where a person makes a contract with themselves in order to make their ability more powerful, this whole idea came across pretty dumb to me, but that's just me. My other issue with the power schemes in HxH are some people's abilities seeming lack-luster (gon) and other people with great potential being ruined (killua). I mean Killua goes from riping out hearts bare-handed, to playing with yoyo's. Granted his godspeed form was awesome and made up for that.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have the Chimera Ant arc..... oh boy. While the arc it's self was solid enough, there were a few aspects that had already started to diminish the show's quality for me, namely in certain people's nen powers (gon and knuckle most of all) and the over-use of narration that seemed to pick up around greed island. At this point any time Gon or a new strong character fought, half the episode was spent listening to someone on the sideline praise the fighter and talk about how gifted they are (in example, multiple times when gon fights you spend several minutes listening to killua talk about how amazing gon is and how he adapts without training). And then the final bullet in the skull to this arc, was the King. Oh my gosh, this is the single biggest rip off I have seen in anime history. One piece, Naruto, and bleach all take many aspects from old greats, like Yuyu and dbz, and adapt something similar in some fashion or another, but the chimera ant king was literally a copy-paste of Cell from dragon ball z. To a T. Both are supreme beings formed from the cells of multiple different organisms, one being done so in a lab, the other in the reproductive system of a creature that consumes a variety of creatures. The appearance is sooooo similar it's just cringy, all the way down to the needle-tipped tail. 0 originality. That isn't even touching on the similarities in personality. Cells first order of business after becoming all powerful, is to test his power against the greatest. The King's first order of business after being born, is to test himself against the greatest minds of different games involving mental acuity, like chess. This all just to kill time while they prepare for his version of the cell games. So both are supreme beings formed from the cells of a variety of organisms and both have a desire to test themselves against the best of the best. And then there's the matter of appearance being a copy-paste.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I thought the show was an 8 or 9 up until the end of the York new city arc, and then the proceeding arc's tanked it down to a 6. Overall worth the watch, nowhere near the best Shonen. Hence it's substantially smaller fan base, as well as quantity of movie and game adaptations in comparison to true GOAT shonens, like OP, Naruto and bleach.\\n\\n\r\nStory 7/10 - Overall good story, however I never felt a serious desire to know what happens next, and the greed island arc really, really disappointed me.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10 - Very well animated, lacking in stunning/spectacular scenes that take your breath away.\\n\\n\r\nSound 5/10 - probably the most subjective of all these catagories, I did not enjoy any of the intros/outros and the soundtrack was so dull I didn't even notice it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10/10 - Because of great character's like the Zuldics and Phantom Troop I'm giving this a 10, although most of the best characters basically get no more than some backround building, and then are ignored as far as the anime goes (phantom troop, hisoka, Killua's family). That, paired with lame characters like Knuckle and some lame power schemes, tempt me to drop this category to an 8.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/overall 6/10 - started out spectacular, dropped insanely during and after greed island. excluding everything post York-New city arc I would give 8/10",

            "content": "Hunter x Hunter could be described as a revolutionary and unorthodox anime in the sense that it is unpredictable, cunning and intelligent, especially when comparing it to other popular sh\u014dnen such as One Piece, Bleach or Naruto. It is a tale which seems to start off as a simple battle sh\u014dnen, yet escalates into an unforeseeable development that delves deep into human psychology, death and hope, in addition to being composed of one of the greatest cast of well fleshed out villains, which is very rare to see in the genre itself. It is a must watch for anyone who is acquainted to the medium.It is a show that can arguably boast of having the best arcs presented in shonens, which is an achievement on its own. With that being said, it naturally has its flaws as well which will be illustrated below in addition to its numerous strengths.\\n\\n\r\n~Story~\\n\\n\r\nThe premise of Hunter x Hunter is simple in nature, the twelve-year-old Gon Freecs setting out to find his father, who abandoned him as a child to become a Hunter. Trying to understand why his own father abandoned him because of his profession Gon chooses to become one in order to find his father. It is a profession riddled with danger, ranging from tasks such as researching species, capturing criminals, searching for treasures or exploring the unknown. What however makes this anime outstanding is the journey it undertakes towards its conclusion, as many have pointed out, with a compelling narrative and fleshed out characters, fantastic soundtrack and animation. It is an adventure enveloped in friendships and encounters with the likes of Killua, Kurapika and Leorio, in addition to countless hardships and the search of what it actually means to be a hunter, an exploration of oneself.\\n\\n\r\nThe narrative is the strongest point of the anime, carrying a powerful analysis of humanity and several messages:  to not group people into categories such as evil or good, friendship and the appreciation of the little things in life. Exposition wise, there is an external narrator at times, which explains in more detail several situations, as well as the characters thoughts, which for some may be a drawback. It presents itself with various types of situations seen in other anime such as tournaments, card battles, thriller and psychological ones throughout its duration, which in some cases don't blend in well with the narrative and the atmosphere. In a way, this breaks the immersion in the story as it often  The story is structured into seven arcs, some huge, some magnificent, others arguably lackluster in comparison. Viewers may observe a progression into a darker atmosphere, whilst maintaining its moments of cheerfulness. Some of these arc are however far from perfect: plot holes, illogical actions, and plot convenient situations happen as well, together with some progression issues. Nevertheless, these could be easily overlooked as these were intriguing, full of suspense and were unpredictable; these can be brutal, where death and mayhem is present.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing of the narrative is overall well done, hardly ever having stretched or rushed scenes, although later on it is apparent that some episodes were affected by these to accommodate the battle intense animation scenes. This affects mostly some episodes in the Chimera Ant arc. The first batch of episodes are mainly dedicated to the introduction of different characters and their respective goals, as well as slowly giving the viewer an image of how the world of Hunter x Hunter might be shaped. Furthermore, as story progresses, more is shown, which is actually quite interesting, as it is pretty unconventional. Being based on current human civilization with all the different flavours within, the flora is much more exotic, with huge trees, which could be said about the fauna as well. Audiences may attribute it to the likes of Dragon Ball in its variety. In addition, there are many places inaccessible for the common folk, only restricted to hunters due to the dangers within that region, which creates a lot potential for the author to work with.\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned earlier, as the story develops, it begins displaying the different things in the world, such as the introduction of \"Nen\", social structure, a great variety of characters including villains, the different political factions within the Hunter Association and naturally, the adventure of the protagonists. However, when the anime begins to explore the psychological aspect, it is where it shines: it dedicates itself  to the analysis of humanity and their nature as a species, as well as themes as cynicism and hope, whilst increasing the characterisation of its cast. These aspect are conveyed through the representation of dictatorship (which audiences may see some similarities to that of N.Korea), political discrepancies among hunters and the government, you name it. The author manages to portray said elements thoroughly, in addition to showing viewers the true beauty of nature and its infinite potential. Through the characters and their evolution, egoism, individuality, selflessness, loyalty and love are portrayed. It also exposes both ally and foe at their best and worst, enhancing the overall experience of the show.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, another important aspect to consider is the battles that are executed alongside the story and its respective techniques and exploration. These are wonderfully relayed to the viewer, being well paced, intense and unpredictable. Another positive aspect is that said abilities are obtained through rigorous training (comparing it to other sh\u014dnens), which nearly eliminates the occurrence of power ups and \"asspulls\". What comes as a surprise however is that the main protagonists are susceptible to defeat, and are not the necessarily the strongest characters in the anime. In fact, the protagonists experience defeat on numerous occasions, creating much more tension when the fighting starts. Nen is also introduced in the anime, which could be considered a superpower to the likes of Chakra or Devil Fruits, or the famous Ki from Dragon Ball. \\n\\n\r\nWhat makes Nen interesting is the endless variety within. What however stands out, which in turn makes Hunter x Hunter somewhat unique, is that the battles are not solely dependent on raw power: intellectual cunning is heavily relied on. It ultimately proposes what true strength really means: power? Intelligence? Speaking of Nen and power ups, the anime sadly suffers some issues, affecting in particular some rules introduced with regards to Nen and its abilities, which was a rather big drawback. This was especially the case when the story was nearing its conclusion, having managed to create an atmosphere where stakes were high, Nen could suddenly be used to obtain ridiculous amount of power, leaving audiences thinking why all the other characters (antagonists in particular) didn't do the same.\\n\\n\r\n~Characters~\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Hunter x Hunter wouldn't be as well crafted without its numerous characters. First of all, let me begin by mentioning that even though they may come over as typical archetypes, these are well-developed characters, especially the main protagonists. Another thing to note is the fact that most characters are susceptible to death, although positive, sometimes is not well executed. This is the case when some characters are introduced, only to shortly afterwards die without any character progression whatsoever, leaving viewers most of the time indifferent. Maybe another thing to note is the fact that the female cast takes a background position: males are of importance.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters that undergo most character development are definitely Gon and Killua. Gon has a cheerful and positive personality, in addition to being egotistical, yet it is clear that he is smart as well; characterised by the use of his fishing rod, he uses strategies that are tied to this, such as sneak attacks, hit and run, you name it, which is quite unconventional. As the story progresses, viewers observe how he grows and get to know his values and personality, seeing his deep affection with life and that of his friends. This deep-rooted loyalty to his friends causes him to cast aside his humanity in one instance. As for Killua, he could be considered the most interesting character, as he undergoes the biggest character development in the whole show. He has a dark past, entangled with his family: he knows no love, nor friendship, he only knows superficial joy. It is apparent that throughout the series he begins to see the bright side of life, in particular that of unconditional friendship, especially during the Chimera arc, where he plays a central role.\\n\\n\r\nThe exploration of other characters such as Leorio or Kurapika are very weak in comparison. A lot of potentiallly interesting characters are relaid to the viewers, yet most of them are left unexplored, or are either forgotten. There are several chaarcters that stand out, yet one should be mentioned, and that is Netero, which no one could ever forget. A cheerful old man, yet very strong, both in his conviction and skills, who lives to acquire the ultimate power. Other characters of interest are Knuckle, seen as a typical \"delinquent\" of the 90's as well as Morel McCarnthy. The Zoldyck family is certainly of interest as well, as these are composed of a great variety of interesting characters, and will play important roles in the events to come.\\n\\n\r\nWhere the anime really shines character wise is in its villains. The villains as a whole can be described as varied, with motives and values. Almost every single one of them is fantastically fleshed out, caring for their companions, which is so rare to see in sh\u014dnen counterparts. As mentioned earlier, the anime proposes to not categorise people into evil or good, which can be appreciated through the phantom troupe, which may seem at first as remorseless killers. This is however clearly visible are the chimera ants, as these may seem \"evil\" for humanity, yet these only act according to nature, which in turn draws parallels with how humans treat other species. In addition, the story often focuses on these characters, rather than the main protagonists who at times take supporting roles, carefully showing the viewer their personalities, as well as developing them through the numerous situations and own struggles with their beliefs. This is especially apparent in both the Yorkshin and Chimera Ant arcs. Villains of note are: Hisoka, the crazy battle hungry clown, the phantom troupe and its respective members, as well as the numerous members of the chimera ants.\\n\\n\r\n~Animation and sound~ \\n\\n\r\nWhile the characters design can be seen as childish and may be a drawback for some, it has a great distinctive cast of characters, which is a huge bonus. This is in addition to the different unimportant characters that have distinctive designs as well. It must be mentioned that some character's design is lacking, in the sense that those are nearly exact copies of iconic characters such as Cell from Dragon Ball. Speaking of animation, it is done by the studio Madhouse. It is very fluid, in addition to its combat scenes, as well as correctly conveying the emotional states of the characters through detailed facial expressions. Backgrounds are well drawn and varied, often befitting of the setting.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors performed their roles well, easily conveying the personalities of each different character. What however stands out is its soundtrack, which is varied and suited the atmosphere it is trying to portray: drums, electric guitar, simple sounds, orchestra, there is really a lot of variety. It must be noted that some of these are either overused or wrongly implemented in some situations.\\n\\n\r\n~Enjoyment~\\n\\n\r\nHunter x Hunter was overall a fantastic experience, with its gripping storyline, characters and soundtracks. Although the story was very gripping, it also had its share of flaws, and some big ones at that, especially when nearing its conclusion. The interactions with the cast are smart and never dragged out either. Furthermore, it is interesting to see how many of its ideas were implemented later on in series such as Naruto for example. Nevertheless, the well paced narrative, well fleshed out villains and its unorthodox approach to its execution, alongside with its psychological aspects, make it easily one of the most entertaining sh\u014dnens out there, which in turn made it very easy to watch a lot of episodes in a session. Hunter x Hunter is highly recommended to anyone who likes sh\u014dnens. At face value it seems like it's targeted to younger audiences, yet the underlying depth to the characters/story will only be appreciated by older audiences.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading.\\n\\n\r\n-Special thanks to the fellow user OnTheShore for proofreading and pointing out mistakes made.",

            "content": "I came to know the original version of HxH since years ago. At first, the only thing I cared about in the series was the Hunter exam. I just wanted to know what kind of test it was so I tried watching it and surprisingly, I loved both the story and the characters after a few episodes. Years later, I was delighted when I heard about the reboot and from start to finish, Hunter x Hunter (2011) doesn't disappoint.\r\nThe story starts with Gon, a 12-year-old boy who sets out for a journey to find his father and his first step is to become a Hunter.A Hunter is an individual who has enough luck and talent to pass the Hunter exam. A Hunter specializes in something, can be practically anything, you name it. A Hunter lives by a power system called Nen in a universe that cleverly reflects the dark side of our real world.\\n\\n\r\nEssentially, being a Hunter isn't special but when it's combined with a well-designed power system and universe, it means infinite possibilities and I have to say Yoshihiro Togashi brilliantly executes that.\\n\\n\r\nThis series has all shounen elements but doesn't follow generic shounen patterns. It begins simply but gradually gets more complex and very unpredictable. A journey of the protagonist and his friends to achieve their goals is as reasonable and realistic as it can get. It has many details, takes time and consists of both success and failure. The MCs don't get a privilege to have special powers or suddenly get stronger for no reasons. They train and evolve as the story progresses. On the other hand, the antagonists don't just act out of pure evil. Their reasons are justifiable in different perspectives.\\n\\n\r\nHxH has 7 arcs. Each one is related but has its own conflict and uniqueness. My personal favorite is the Yorknew arc from episode 39-58. After each arc, the concept of Hunter is explored bit by bit and you will keep getting a bigger picture of the whole Hunter universe. The atmosphere varies from a light-hearted shounen to one of the darkest seinen to fit each arc so it keeps things fresh and intriguing. Each fight is mostly strategic-based and relatively short. It's clever and never defies the logic of Nen.\\n\\n\r\nApart from the story, the best thing about the series is the characters. For me, characters make or break the show and HxH characters are top-notch. They really make the series shine.\\n\\n\r\nMost, if not, all characters and their relationships are realistic because they are imperfect. Not only the MCs, many supporting characters have also undergone a substantial amount of development through the course of the series. Most of them are round characters with distinctive personalities, appearances, backgrounds, powers, ambitions and the ability to think. Their actions are driven by their own judgment as an individual, not what the plot requires them to do so it's very easy to sympathize with them, even the antagonists.\\n\\n\r\nIn term of production, HxH has unique art style with great and very consistent animation for a series that has over 100 episodes. The pacing is satisfying because there are no fillers at all. Voice actors and actresses are suitable for each character. OPs, EDs and OSTs are good even if there is only one opening song so far.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the negatives, there isn't a major problem in the series and all the minor ones i.e. change of narration style and slow pacing in 6th arc, repetitive op song, long absence of a character etc. didn't bother me as much. If anything, I think the only reason you shouldn't watch HxH now is because the manga is still ongoing. Despite a somewhat satisfying conclusion, you could call these 148 episodes a season one and honestly, you will not get a season two, not anytime soon considering the hiatus history of Togashi.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Hunter x Hunter (2011) exceeds all my expectations. I would recommend this series to anyone, especially a shounen fan because I think it's one of a very few anime that is truly remarkable, well-executed and very enjoyable. Watch it and you will understand why this anime deserves its rank.",

            "content": "I never gave Hunter x Hunter more than a passing glance previously. The large episode count, uninteresting story description, and silly looking character designs put me off from watching the show. However, after finally taking the plunge into this series after being given a recommendation, I\u2019m so glad that I watched it. I would have missed out on a true gem of an anime otherwise. \r\nThe anime follows the story of Gon Freecs, a twelve year old boy who decides to take the challenging and highly dangerous Hunter Exam in order to become a Hunter. Those who pass the exam receive a Hunter License whichgives the owner special privileges and status. Gon\u2019s personal goal for clearing the exam is not to get all of the superficial perks of being a Hunter but to be able to someday reunite with his father, who is a Hunter and left Gon at a young age. On his journey, Gon meets both friends and foes and faces various challenges. The story, admittedly, does not sound especially enticing. However, Gon\u2019s journey is filled with twists and turns and often betrays expectations in the best of ways. I found that events often did not play out as I would have expected, but the way they unfolded felt very natural and well written. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime covers seven story arcs, with a trend of an alternation between serious arcs and lighter, more training oriented arcs. The story is one of the strongest points of the show; the writing at the show\u2019s worst is better than that of other shows at their best. One of the later arcs in the show is noticeably darker than the rest and is one of my favorites with regard to story and writing, touching on a variety of themes and ideas that provide some good food for thought. As a side note, the heavy narration during this particular arc seems to be a point of contention among fans; I personally found it to be an interesting method of storytelling, but I could understand why some would not enjoy it. I found the fight scenes of Hunter x Hunter to be another exceptionally notable point regarding the quality of writing. Rarely are fights based around just brute force strength and visuals. Instead, the fights are incredibly enjoyable because of the complex strategies employed by those who are in combat. \\n\\n\r\nThe main characters of the show are Gon, Killua, Kurapika, and Leorio. Gon is upbeat and cheerful with a strong sense of determination, and Killua acts as sort of a foil to Gon, being generally positive while staying more grounded to reality than Gon. Kurapika is an intelligent youth who is out for revenge against those who committed atrocities against his clan, and Leorio is the silly yet charismatic guy, serving as comic relief at times. Of these characters, Gon and Killua, being those that receive the most screen time, get the most character development. Killua, through his friendship with and experiences with Gon, opens up and becomes a less cold individual. Gon has some interesting character development in the latter part of the show, as he begins to face situations that his boundless determination and optimism cannot fix. \\n\\n\r\nThe villains in this show are great, with personalities ranging from calm and collected to quite insane, and I would say that they are more interesting than the protagonists. They are hardly what I would call generic, for the most part, and have distinctive characteristics which make them intriguing characters to follow. The villains are also presented in a way that makes them feel like true threats to the protagonists rather than simple obstacles in the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation in Hunter x Hunter is nothing short of phenomenal. Madhouse did an excellent job with this show; the animation is fluid, especially during fights, and the art is crisp and beautiful. The fact that this high standard of quality is kept throughout the entire show is especially admirable. The actual character designs might not be appealing to some, but looking past that it is hard to deny the quality of this show on a visual level. If nothing else, this show is a treat for the eyes. \\n\\n\r\nI have less praise for the music. The sound track is decent overall, with some excellent orchestral tracks in the mix. However, I felt that some tracks were used far too often to the point where I would occasionally get irritated by some of the music. I feel that an increase in the variety of music used would have benefited the show. Also, the opening theme, featuring two sets of lyrics, is the same throughout the entire show. Departure is a good song, but I think it would have been nice to have different songs for the different arcs. The upbeat nature of the opening doesn\u2019t quite suit the tone of the darker arcs in the show. \\n\\n\r\nI wouldn\u2019t call this show perfect, but it does so many things so well throughout its 148 episode run with nary a drop in overall quality that I cannot help but be amazed.  If you feel hesitant about starting this show because of the art, length, or other petty matter as I was, consider giving it a chance. Keep an open mind, and you might find yourself liking it much more than you expected, as I did. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "The lack of popularity surrounding Hunter x Hunter (2011) has always confused me, especially after catching up to it six months ago. For an anime that seems to do everything right, it isn't talked about a lot at a popular level. Neither has it been successful in garnering a fan base similar to that of SNK or SAO. I decided to write this review to do the show justice. If a show this good is still flying under your radar or if you are discouraged from watching this because of its \"childish appearance\" then reading this review is a must.\r\nStory:\r\nHxH is about a young boynamed Gon who embarks on a journey to find his father. After learning that his father left him at a young age to become a Hunter, Gon decides to follow in his footsteps not only to find him, but also to see what was so special about the profession that made his father choose it over him. Although a story of finding one's father is simple, it is the path that is taken towards this end that makes the series truly special. HxH is made up of several arcs that are all extremely well-written, which brings me to the best part of the series, the writing. Hunter x Hunter (2011) boasts one of the finest writing in the world of shonen; the depth and flow of the story, enthralling characterizations, strong dialogue and impressive world-building are all crafted into a fascinating tale that can absorb viewers into lengthy marathons. \\n\\n\r\nThe amount of variety that is packed into HxH's story is also very impressive. HxH successfully dabbles in several genres in six story arcs tackling survival, fighting tournaments, crime thriller, virtual realities, war and politics. Not only that, the series is also able to undergo significant tonal shifts with ease (light to dark and vice versa). Sometimes, these shifts in tone occur after an arc ends though other times, it even occurs mid-arc. Another thing about HxH is that its arcs are connected with one another, with each arc naturally following the one before it. This creates a natural transition that highlights what the series really is, a journey. As for pacing and development, they are excellent. For the most part, HxH is very well paced. The series does a fantastic job at keeping its viewers engaged, time will fly by as you watch most episodes and you'll find yourself breezing through the show. Excluding two recap episodes, HxH has no filler episodes. Due to this, story progression is solid with the plot moving forward with each episode.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough HxH initially gives off a light hearted impression, it gives off a good one. Not the kind of \u201clight heartedness\u201d that makes you say \u201cthis is childish and below me\u201d but the kind that appeals to everyone. HxH gives off that classic and charming shonen vibe that has been lost in recent years, and it does so with its head held up high. Eventually though, the series takes a dark turn. Although most HxH story arcs are light hearted, both Yorknew and the Chimera Ant arc are two of the best and darkest arcs shonen has to offer. Yorknew can be described as a dark thriller in a big city. The central theme of the arc is revenge and it is similar to Death Note in terms of thrill and atmosphere. On the other hand, the Chimera Ants arc can be described as an attempt by the Hunters Association to control an outbreak of a dangerous man-eating species. It is the darkest and most thematically powerful arc in the series tackling themes such as identity, human nature and survival of the fittest. The arc has drawn comparisons to Yu Yu Hakusho\u2019s Chapter Black for its seinen-like nature and is similar to Shingeki no Kyojin, where the protagonists experience a strong sense of despair in the face of a vastly superior, hostile species. The series undergoes major tonal shifts in both arcs with the color palette, music, atmosphere and amount of violence changing significantly. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, what sets the series apart from other battle anime is its unorthodoxy and unpredictability. Shonen tropes and storytelling methods are undermined throughout the series. The main character for example, Gon, fails more than he succeeds. Power-ups based on emotion or willpower are non-existent and fighting in the series is radically different from other battle anime. The main protagonist is not the main focus of every arc either. At certain points in the series, you could even say that Gon has taken a supporting role, especially during the later portions of the CA arc where he isn't given as much focus due to the grand scope of the story. The standard battle anime formula of \u201close-train-win\u201d is also undermined. Although there is training, it does not always translate to a victory, nor does it propel the protagonists over or to the same level as their main adversaries in terms of strength. For the most part, the protagonists assume the underdog role. Although they have incredible potential, they are still kids who have a lot to learn. In terms of storytelling, unpredictable developments are commonplace. One thing that continues to amaze me with this show is how it leads viewers into thinking that the story will progress in this direction, only to change course and arrive at a completely different outcome. A good example of this would be the series' arcs which often end in an anti-climatic manner. Basically, there are a lot of scenes and story developments that you won\u2019t see coming because they defy conventional shonen storytelling or are unpredictable in their own right.\\n\\n\r\nThe series' unorthodoxy can also be seen in its fights which are primarily cerebral. In addition to being well-executed, HxH fights are smart and involve a lot of strategy. Raw power is a factor but it is not the factor that decides battle outcomes, actual power (nen abilities), experience and strategy are all taken into account. If a main character is outclassed by an opponent in all or most categories, he is likely to lose. Moreover, main characters are not given any special treatment in combat. This smart approach to fighting is further enhanced by nen, a unique and complex power system held by defined rules. The concept of nen, its principles, aura types and many applications on the battlefield reveal the huge amount of thought that was put into it. I still remember having to pause episodes, even research a bit during its introduction, just to digest it in its entirety. \\n\\n\r\nThe appearance and writing of the series also create an effect of cognitive dissonance, the simplistic look of the show mentally conflicts with the brilliance and unorthodoxy of its writing. As new viewers delve deeper into HxH, they realize that there is much more to the show than its cover art and synopsis suggest. Expectations of the series being immature, simple or generic are progressively overturned as the show reveals its surprising underbelly.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nAs for sound, HxH has a line of great soundtracks that started off decent but got better as the series progressed. With the exception of a few minor characters, the voice acting in this series is excellent. As a person who has never seen the old series it\u2019s hard to believe that these aren't the original voices because they fit extremely well, especially those of Gon, Killua and Hisoka whose voice actors do a perfect job of capturing their characters. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nHxH also has great art and animation. It amazes me how a long-running series like HxH delivers consistent quality animation episode after episode, especially during the fights. The series does a great job of capturing facial expressions and everything from the lighting, shading and colors adjust perfectly depending on the mood of the scene or the tone of the arc. As one reviewer (nagaiyume) said, the bright colors of the show might need some getting used to, though it is usually fans of the old series who have this problem. Personally, I think it fits the show perfectly. It adds to the charm of the series by complementing its sense of adventure, uplifting atmosphere and unique appeal as a shonen that looks simple but is actually remarkably deep. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nAlthough HxH\u2019s primary strength lies in its writing, its characters come pretty damn close. HxH has a huge cast of characters. They have quirks, dreams, inner demons, world views and overall, really likable personalities. To top it off, most of them don\u2019t follow generic character archetypes. Although some may initially come across as \u201cgeneric\u201d, these assumptions are gradually undermined as the series progresses. \\n\\n\r\nIf there's one thing I want to emphasize in the character department it would be the series main villains. When it comes to characters, this is where the show shines the brightest. HxH villains are extremely well-written (with the exception of the Bomber who won't apply to most of what I'll say below). Not only are their characterizations independently impressive, they are also distinct from one another; no two villains are the same. This distinctness does not only apply within the series but outside of it. You won't find another Hisoka, Chrollo or Ant King in any other anime. This is what makes HxH villains so compelling, in addition to having really impressive characterizations, they are also original. Although I excluded one out of the four main villains from most of what I wrote above, all HxH villains do have one thing in common. Each villain strikes fear into audience, the series does a good job of establishing the level of danger these characters bring to the story and our protagonists. \\n\\n\r\nNegatives:\\n\r\nHowever, while HxH is a great series it isn't perfect. The series doesn't have a strong start, it takes three episodes for show to get going. I've seen a lot of people drop HxH early and it sucks because the first two episodes don't capture the series at all. Things start to get mildly interesting in the third episode, after that, the series just gets better and better. HxH also suffers from occasional BGM misuse. There are odd sound choices for some scenes. Sometimes they don\u2019t really fit, other times they don\u2019t fit it all. Lastly, the Chimera Ant arc also has minor issues with both Togashi and Madhouse to blame. Togashi\u2019s fault lies in his writing during the middle of the CA arc which I think, pales in comparison to the rest of the series. HxH has made a name for itself for holding a consistent high level throughout its run; it\u2019s a series that\u2019s just so engaging and easy to marathon. However, I believe this consistency took a hit mid-CA arc (due to handling of the story and pacing) specifically, episodes 89-98. Don\u2019t get me wrong though, I think there are a fair number of good episodes within that 9-episode stretch but unfortunately, they are surrounded by mediocre episodes that break the consistency of an otherwise exceptional arc. Madhouse\u2019s fault lies in its adaption of the manga chapters comprising episodes 113 and 115, which were dragged out in order to have episode 116 handled by their best animation team. Episode 113 was actually well paced except for one atrocious sequence while episode 115 as a whole was generally poorly paced.\\n\\n\r\nA clarification about the \"slowed down pacing\" of Chimera Ant arc:\\n\r\nIf you\u2019ve been reading up about HxH, you\u2019ve probably seen some people complain about the \u201cpoor pacing\u201d during the \u201cnarration heavy episodes\u201d of the CA arc. Well if you\u2019re wondering how much truth is there to this statement and were going to ask me about it, my answer would be it depends.\\n\\n\r\nAt episode 111, the palace invasion (climax of the CA arc) begins and narration begins to play a huge role in episodes in order to (1) pack a whole level of depth into the story and (2) increase dramatic tension. Rather than a high octane \"action fest\" people would expect from a shonen arc climax, the palace invasion takes a psychological heavy route wherein a character\u2019s thoughts and mental state are given more focus than the actual action. This psychological focus together with the narration slows down the pace considerably in the sense that episodes begin to cover a lot less in narrative time. However, despite this \u201cslowed down pace\u201d, the pacing of these episodes remain solid with good amount of manga chapters being covered during each of these episodes and the duration of scenes being on point (except for episodes 113 and 115 which I mentioned earlier in this review).\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, it depends if the narration works on you or not. If you like the psychological approach and experience an increase in suspense then you\u2019ll have no problems with the pacing and are in for one helluvah of a ride. However, if you don\u2019t like the psychological approach and feel that the narrator\u2019s heavy presence breaks your immersion then you\u2019re in for a grueling experience. Of course, there are other combinations such as liking the psychological route but not feeling the immersion or maybe the narration just didn't work on you completely. Well, if this happens to be the case then you\u2019ll end up with mixed feelings. On the bright side, most people who end up watching the invasion end up enjoying the narration. However, if you happen to be one of the good number of people who end up not liking the narration don\u2019t worry, only episodes 111-118 of the palace invasion have heavy narration. After episode 118, the narration begins to decrease and episodes eventually reach a point where they are \u201cback to normal\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nHeads up to people looking for action:\\n\r\nAlthough I love the fighting aspect of the series and consider it to be a strong plus, I\u2019ll leave this out there for the sake of subjectivity. HxH does not cater to everyone. Although fights in the series are well-executed, they are also short (1-10 minutes) and happen less in comparison to other battle anime. Moreover, the focus on strategy in battles might be off putting to people who prefer fights with more brawn and less brain. If you're expecting an action heavy series like Yu Yu Hakusho then you will be disappointed. This is because HxH is a series that relies on its story to reel in viewers. Personally, I think this is how fighting in shonen should be done. Fighting should be able to entertain and also make you think. It shouldn't drag on for too long at the expense of the story without leaving you underwhelmed. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\nHunter x Hunter (2011) is an intelligent battle anime with a fantastic story, excellent characters and fights that involve a lot of strategy. Separating it from most of its genre, the series subverts shonen tropes and boasts unpredictable plot progressions that make it truly unique.\\n\\n\r\nOverall scores:\\n\r\nStory: 10/10 (Outstanding)\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10 (Outstanding)\\n\r\nArt: 9/10 (Great)\\n\r\nSound: 8/10 (Great but occasionally misused)\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10 (Extremely high)\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10 (Masterpiece)",

            "content": "---The review contains spoilers---\r\n\u201cYou should enjoy the little detours. To the fullest. Because that\u2019s where you\u2019ll find the things more important than what you want\u201d. (Hunter Election Arc).\r\nI don\u2019t have words enough to describe what was this 148 episodes for me.\r\nI'll not spend this review talking about the Synopsis, because It\u2019s right here on MAL.\r\nI need to tell you, why you must watch this masterpiece, and what it represents to me.\r\nFirst of all I\u2019m gonna talk about the final episode. I felt Joy, sadness, angry (Togashi hurry up with the manga! hahah), and of course, satisfaction. Satisfaction because I heard my friends (you NEEDto watch it), because it wasn\u2019t time wasted, because those 148 episodes, and the nights that I spent watching, were worth, really. Hunter x Hunter is a complex anime, a peculiar story, something that, certainly, will mix up with your feelings, with your thoughts, with your conception of a Shonen. \\n\\n\r\nWhat do I mean? It\u2019s not that simple. But I\u2019ll try to clarify: Don\u2019t think that you\u2019re about to find predictable arcs. Don't think that the heroes gonna always beat the villains (In some parts of the story... nobody wins). Don\u2019t think that training and good skills can ensure that you'll defeat an enemy, sometimes you'll need more than that. Behold what humans can be (and Togashi show us really well in Chimera Ant Arc). Behold what friendship can be, in all it\u2019s complexity. You\u2019re not gonna see in this anime that kind of Main Character that is AWESOME for no reason, no training. Togashi will make you understand the personality of the characters and their powers. Power, I mean, Nen or aura (vital energy), similar to what we see in other shonens like, Dragon Ball (Ki) or Naruto (Chakra). It's presented to us really well how the \"Nen system\" works. The explanations are long in some episodes, but simple to understand. \\n\\n\r\nTalking now about the animation: Hunter x Hunter is breathtaking . Indeed, it can be said that Madhouse did an excellent job with the remake . I was amazed with what I saw in some episodes. I confess that many of them I've watched over and over again, just to observe the details of the animation, and not only what was happening in the story ( Episode 131 I\u2019ve watched 4 times ). In the end , I'm grateful that Madhouse animated Hunter x Hunter from the beginning .\\n\\n\r\nThe characters.. oh they are unique, really. It's quite impressive how Togashi gave to them a variety of personalities. You'll not gonna enjoy only the four main characters (although many consider that the main are Gon and Killua, since the story focuses more on the two of them from a certain phase). Hunter x Hunter have a significant  character development on the supporting ones too, and, of course in the villains (you'll love them, believe me).  I don't have a favorite character in this show. It's impossible to choose one. Watch it and you'll experience what I'm saying.\\n\\n\r\nYou mean this show has nothing bad?\\n\r\nYes it has.\\n\r\n1) The worst thing in this show is: It ended.\\n\r\nOkay, joking aside, I think is the worst part is the beginning. You have to watch 4 or 5 episodes to feel in the mood to still watching. Many people just gave up in the first episodes. I can ensure you, go on and watch it til the end. \\n\r\nParticularly I don\u2019t like so much The Hunter Exam Arc, the first arc of the story. If you compare with the other arcs it\u2019s really not the best one. I have in my heart this two arcs: Chimera Ant Arc and Yorknew city Arc.\\n\\n\r\nThe second thing many fans of the show complains a LOT, is the Opening song. Why? 148 episodes, different openings, but... THE SAME SONG. For me it wasn't a problem at all. I love the song, and... I think I watched the opening \u201cone hundred and forty-eight\u201d times and I sang it. Hahaha. But I really wanted to see a new song too.\\n\\n\r\nThe third thing is totally my personal opinion: the narrator. Your first contact with him will be in the begining of the early episodes. He will explain what is a Hunter.\\n\r\nThe narration it's something that we don't see a lot in other animes. I like it, it's brilliant and I totally understand that this add gives the anime the suspense and it's particular style. \\n\r\nThe advantage of having a narrator, in my opinion, is the ''observer factor''. Instead of exploring the point of view of all the characters, we have that peculiar element that seems to know everything and adds important information to the audience. \\n\r\nBut, eventually, the narrator annoys me, specially in the Chimera ant Arc. I mean: we see what's going on, it's not necessary an explanation! \\n\r\nOf course that the ''narration effect'' will depend on the way you receive it. Sometimes will give that \"slow motion\" you'll need to absorb what's going on, but in a few episodes it's really overused. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I have to thank above all, you Togashi Yoshihiro. You're brilliant. You can make unique characters, outstanding plots. You still go on, and on,  in successive hiatus in the manga, and everyone complains a lot (even me), but then what you show to us is so amazing that makes it worth waiting. Thank you for exist and for this awesome masterpiece.\\n\r\nFor you that didn't watch it yet, do not be fooled by the first few episodes or with the synopsis. Both of them will give you the impression that you're about to see a generic shounen. Insist. This is a kind of anime that in each episode everything seems to evolve: the story, the setting, the characters. You will be hooked, unable to stop watching .\\n\r\nAnd then my friend, you will start to feel pain. Yes, pain, when you realize that you're at the 100\u00ba episode and there is only 48 episodes left.\\n\\n\r\nEmbrace this adventure called Hunter x Hunter! xD",

            "content": "At first, when I read the synopsis of hunter x hunter (2011) (for the rest of this review will be called hxh as abbreviation) I could not quite deduce the rationality of this show being scored and reviewed with such praise as it receives on a daily basis. I am sure many of you ,who are planning to pick up this show sometime soon, are thinking the same as I did before watching this show and I will do my best to change any contravening opinions towards this series.\r\nStory: 9\r\nAs you all have likely read the synopsis of hxh, it certainly stands out from mostother shounen ever made. There is a kid that decides to go on an adventure, for a particular purpose, meets friends, becomes stronger and eventually defeats powerful opponents. It doesn't come off as a very complex or intriguing story/plot, nor is there a generic/forgettable cast and an amassed other facts that would remind you of how forgettable this show probably is. Believe me it's not.\\n\r\nBeyond the first few episodes which this generalised speculation derives from, you will see that hxh differs from most shounen in terms of intelligence (strategic battles, clever arcs and plot) and the pacing of the whole show throughout each arc is outstanding. The absence of fillers throughout the 148 episodes ( excluding recaps) makes this show that much less frustrating to watch.\\n\r\nYou may have heard an arc in particular, that the MAL community keeps on raving about: the Chimera Ant arc. Without throwing any spoilers in this review, the hype is worth it. This arc is, by most fans of the franchise, seen as a masterstoke and with good reason. The previous arcs create a substantial build-up to the C.A arc which makes the emphasis and usefulness of the arc that much more prominent.\\n\r\nHowever, the only factor that prevented my rating of a 9 to a 10, was the slow start and the half-open ending; while it not bad and was a good conclusion to the show, left the viewer rather unsettled with the whole experience.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\\n\r\nWhere hxh really shines is in the shows' magnificent cast. As stated in my introduction, typically, most shounen do not have the best cast of characters that anime has brought out to the community, and more often than not defeat their enemies using the all-mighty force that is  'the power of friendship(!)' which brings sweet victory and joy to the protagonists of the show. Forget this ever existed in anime when watching hxh, as the sincere friendship that is witnessed between the main cast is nothing short of magnificent. It is realistic and evolves over a long period of time.\\n\r\nWhat makes the characters of hxh further at a stand-point, is that the antagonists are (for the most part) just as likable as the protagonists. Every character is very well developed ( every = any character that mattered to the story) and therefore does not make you want to spurt out the words \" Wow, this character sucks \" , with the exception of the bomber which, when watching the series, you will notice that had no real purpose for doing things to the extent that he did.\\n\r\nFinally, I will talk about my three favorite characters of the series:\\n\\n\r\n1. Gon\\n\\n\r\nI love Gon. At first he seems like your everyday generic protagonist that has no potential to evolve as a person. He comes across as useless and annoying.Then along the way something happens to him; something that is rarely in a protagonist like him. This is called ' Character Development '. The development that Gon receives throughout the series is fantastic and will make you love him until the end. He truly is desperate to find his father and the audience can see how he never throws in the towel.\\n\\n\r\n2. Killua\\n\\n\r\nThere's something really likable about white-haired guys in anime and Killua does not fall short in this aspect. He has a broad and complex backstory, and again, like Gon, significant development, which is seen to play a phenomenal role to how realistic the friendship between Gon and Killua is. His background as an assassin and his scarring childhood coupled with his raw talent and one-of-a-kind personality makes him a lovable and three-dimensional character.\\n\\n\r\n3. Meruem\\n\\n\r\nWithout spoiling much, Meruem is truly an unbelievable antagonist. At first you envision he is ruthless for no purpose, and comes off as a cliche and rather irritating being. With the meeting of another character you see how he evolves and how his facade in his personality makes him one of the best,if not the greatest character in the series.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation: 10\\n\\n\r\nWhen watching an anime that has a plethora of episodes such as hxh, one would expect a decline and rise in animation from time to time. However, Madhouse did a terrific job at keeping the animation and art as consistent and fluid as possible. The amount of money that was spent purely on budget really surprised me and the animation only gets better as the series progresses. When entering the C.A arc, you will see that Madhouse used their best animators to produce stunning images intertwined \\n\r\nwith outlines, shadows and fluency that serves as 'eye-candy' when watching the series. Battle sequences are as well a proof of how much effort is poured into this show, as the studio does not tend to cut corners, e.g using the same background over and over again.\\n\r\nThe opening and endings' animation improves significantly st time progresses, which blows my mind when comparing the differences in appearance. That is to say, the animation was brilliant at the start of the anime as well.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe opening: 'Departure'  is used throughout the entire anime although it switches between two different versions of the song, as well as changing the animation sequence each time, and this amazes me as every opening suits the anime perfectly! I did not skip the opening even once when watching the series; instead I stared smiling and singing along to the music.\\n\r\nThe endings are all fantastic in my opinion, and I love all the songs that are presented to the audience at the end of each episode. The order for me goes \\n\r\n1>4>2>3>5=6  (5 & 6 are different sections of the same song) but I love them all nevertheless.\\n\r\nThe ost of the anime is one of the best I have heard in any anime. My personal favorite is ' A kingdom of Predators'. It consists of a great variety of orchestra (mostly in the C.A arc) and lots of violin and piano that can be heard as well. However, sometimes the ost is not played at the most appropriate moments which prevents a score of 10 being given.\\n\r\nMonumental credibility must be given to the voice actors, and for Gon in particular, which is seen especially at episode 116, the mere brilliance that is spurted as 'emotions though words' is extraordinary. The only complaint that I sometimes hear arriving from people is that the narration in the C.A arc ( for around 10 episodes) is irritating and overwhelms the episodes, making them seem extremely slow-paced. I tend to  disagree with this argument , as the pacing seems to only benefit by the narration of those episodes, as it was a crucial moment in the series where narration was essential. I hope you won't find this narration an issue, since I certainly didn't.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nWow what a joyful ride this was. It keeps you hooked from early on and urges you to watch the next episode after experiencing the wonderful ending of each arc. The enjoyment factor, of course, originated from the entirety of the show. If any of the above were to be done poorly, the show would not come out to be nearly as enjoyable as it was. I not once felt bored during this series, and I believe that the pacing is fabulous. There's not a single moment that leaves the viewer wanting to skip ahead or fast-forward. As a result, I am almost certain that you will watch this show, engulfed by the brilliance of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\\n\r\nBelieve me when i tell you this: this show is a near masterpiece; as close of a masterpiece as a show of this genre gets. Don't be fooled while watching this anime, and drop it due to its slow start, as you may miss out on a truly miraculous experience.\\n\r\nThank you for reading my review of Hunter x Hunter (2011). Have a great day. RedInfinity out.",

            "content": "\"I see now... Yes... I see... You had me in checkmate from the start.\" - Meruem \r\nHunter x Hunter 2011 is incredibly well appreciated within the myanimelist community, however it never managed to grow a fanbase as large as the ones from other popular Shounen Series like Fairy Tail, Naruto, Bleach... Maybe it's because the series is much younger and I sincerely hope that one time HxH will be as popular as Naruto, because it just deserves it so much. I\u2019ve never seen a better Shounen Series, no a better Anime series before. Hunter x Hunter deserves every single praise it gets. It takes Shounento a whole new level. \\n\\n\r\nAt first glance, I wasn\u2019t too excited to watch Hunter x Hunter, in fact I even wanted to drop the Series after 3 episodes. Everything seemed like your stereotypical Shounen with an annoying protagonist in a scenario, where everything is happy throughout and the fights being overly predictable all the time. Oh, how wrong I was.\\n\\n\r\nAs I\u2019ve already mentioned, the story of HxH looks like the one of every single Shounen and it seems, that it won\u2019t offer new elements and topics. My thoughts were completely vanished before the tenth episode. Although the main idea of the young boy Gon trying to become Hunter and finding his father is very simple, the story gets incredibly deep and complex from time to time. The writing is spectacular throughout, the path\u2019s taken by the main characters to achieve their goals are incredibly creative and unpredictable, every arc offers new topics and even new genres, which couldn\u2019t be attached any better. In conclusion, HxH is the most marathonable Anime I\u2019ve seen so far.\\n\\n\r\nThe fighting system \u201cNen\u201d is very complex and offers near to a thousand different possibilities to fight. There are almost no emotion based Power-Ups in this Anime, most fights are decided by pure tactics, which makes the fights so interesting, at least for me.  \\n\\n\r\nThe story is divided in many different story arcs, like almost every long running Shounen. As I\u2019ve already mentioned, almost every arc sets up things differently. For example, the first arc \u201cHunter exam\u201d and the \u201cGreed Island\u201d arc have much of an adventure feeling, while arc the fourth arc \u201cYorknew City\u201d emphasizes much on thriller elements. Most of the arcs take a while to get things set up, for example the \u201cChimera Ant\u201d arc takes a while to get things set up perfectly, to finish in the most epic way possible with the best use of the genre \u201cDrama\u201d I\u2019ve ever experienced. \\n\\n\r\nThe pacing in Hunter x Hunter is very fast in general. Just compare the amount of chapters the Manga has in comparison to the amount of episodes. That means no fillers at all (if you don\u2019t count the two summery episodes near the beginning), no stupid fanservice, just straight forward Story, which is perfect in my book.  \\n\\n\r\nThe Animation is nearly perfect, that just shows how good Madhouse Animations are in general. The consistent Animation throughout this long Series seriously amazes me. Characters Design is top notch, backgrounds fit the scenery and atmosphere almost every time and facial expressions are done right. I don\u2019t know what specifically is criticize able in this section. \\n\\n\r\nConcerning the Sound, HxH offers a variety of different soundtracks, with true masterpieces in it. Soundtrack wise the Series offered nothing really memorable in the first episodes, but it got better and better when the story progressed, with scenes which couldn\u2019t be accompanied with a certain soundtrack any better. The voice actors did a very good job overall, especially the ones of Gon and Hisoka, which just fit their character perfectly in every scene. \\n\\n\r\nBesides the perfect writing, the second big strength of HxH are the characters and especially their development. Starting with the main character, Gon, his development is absolutely impressive in any way. In contrast to almost every other protagonist in a Shounen Series, Gon fails more than he succeeds and learns from his mistakes. The second main character, Killua, is written perfectly and his backgrounds, intensions etc. are very interesting. The other two members of the starting crew are Kurapika and Leorio, both having their own intentions, good development and understandable backgrounds as well.\\n\\n\r\nHowever the biggest strength of HxH character wise are the antagonists. They\u2019re written so perfectly and unique, you just can\u2019t hate them. You won\u2019t find another Hisoka, Kuroro or Meruem in another Anime, they\u2019re just too unique and likeable.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\nOverall, I have to say I\u2019m simply impressed by Hunter x Hunter in every regard, it\u2019s definitely the best Anime I\u2019ve seen so far and it won\u2019t be easy to fill the void after the Series ended. If you look for a Shounen, which is outstanding in terms of writing, story progression, character development and uniqueness, you have to watch Hunter x Hunter. While it has some weaknesses and rather mediocre episodes from time to time, those little mistakes can easily be overlooked due to the overall extremely high quality of all the other aspects. \\n\\n\r\nStory (9/10)\\n\r\nArt/Animation (9.5/10)\\n\r\nSound (9/10)\\n\r\nCharacters (10/10)\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10+/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall (10/10)\\n",

            "content": "After reading the many overwhelmingly positive reviews about this show, I've decided to write a more realistic, honest and unbiased opinion-driven review about this show.\r\nMany people have said how amazing this show is, and that it's incredibly unique and special. Did I? Well yes......and no.\r\nI am probably one of the very few people that didn't consider this series a masterpiece\r\nStory: \r\nHunters are people who hunt. Whether it is criminals, treasures, rare creatures or even food, they will hunt it.\r\nWe have the story of Gon, a young boy living on Whale island, aspiring to become a hunter like his father, Ging, a legendary hunter who abondonedhim while he was born to chase his dream. Gon also wants to meet his father and find out why he abondoned him while he was a baby.\\n\r\nTo become a hunter, he must pass the dastardly difficult hunter exams, which has an extremely low success rate. Along to way to the exams, he meets a few friends, rivals and a creepy paedo clown, hence beginning the first arc. After that, the concept of nen is introduced, which is basically the life force and magical power source of the series. The concept of nen is actually pretty cool, and it's more complicated to use than some other powers like alchemy and chakra, and it's creativity is often shined upon in fights. However, creativity can destory things aswell, and sometimes nen can be used as an over complicated ability with too much time used to explain different powers.\\n\r\nAfter the exams, there are arcs all varying in tones and stories and this is where problems arise. Some are dark, and some are light. Some arcs are excellent and others are well......terrible dog shit.\\n\r\nNone of the arcs are linked well together and are very disjointed and inconsistent. \\n\r\nInstead of focusing on an overall story, the arcs feel like a bunch of mini-stories building up to a main one, and they focus way too much on the individual arcs instead of an overall story, making it seem like a huge mess. One day, you've got a crime thriller, another one a video game, and then a bug apocalypse. One of the most critcally acclaimed arcs in the series, to me felt like a 60 episode filler, and that experience was not enjoyable at all. It baffles me on how people say it is a masterpiece, but everyone is entitled to their own opinion. The pacing in this arc was unbelievably bad, as was the horrible story and enemy designs (not the main villains though...they were badass).\\n\r\nThe best arc by far is the yorkshin city arc, which doesn't come until episode 40- something.\\n\r\nWhat's more disappointing is that the story of hunter x hunter had huge potential to look into the life of a hunter, but the hunter aspect of the show is not explored much. The final aspect that irked me about the story was over-using narration to the point of unbearable commenting into the smallest of details of the story complicating itself tenfold.\\n\r\nNow, what was good about the story? A decent amount, actually. In the earlier arcs of the series it felt a lot different from other shonen and the individual arc storytelling was actually working very well, as each arc had a purpose to the overall story. Each arc was well written, well paced and had it's fair share of enjoyable and memorable moments. Also the annoying narrator had much less to say. These earlier arcs were much more interesting and intriguing and didn't bore me the way the later arcs did. Really, the quality of the series started degrading by the end of the yorknew city arc.\\n\r\nThe early arcs didn't feel like fillers and contributed something, whereas the later arcs were just random and only inflicted minor things to the story, but did more to the development of the characters, which is not a bad thing, but dragging it out for 60 episodes is a crime in it's own right. Overall the story in hunter hunter varied from being amazing to a total dump. However \"the total dump\" is considered great by everyone, so you should check up the chimera ant arc anyway, you'll probably like it. What the entire story did well were the fights. All of them had wits and brains and didn't take an entire episode just to charge up an attack or talk for hours before the fight. (*cough* Dbz and naruto.)\\n\r\nHowever, when nen (the series' fighting system) kicks in the story downgrades hugely.\\n\r\nInstead of focusing on the story, we need to sit through pointless training regiments and stupid explanations of the usage of nen. Not to say i hate the series' fighting system, but in my opinion, it is far too complex and uninteresting and it sacrifices decent storytelling and replaces it with boredom. (Yes, it can be boring- if you've got a short attention span don't bother watching the later arcs)\\n\r\nAnd last thing I want to note is that the chimera ant arc's story was just horrible and boring- mostly due to its snail pacing.\\n\r\nThere were many plot holes (why would the hunter association send two under experienced twelve year olds to get rid of the ants? Why didn't netero just bomb the nest to begin with?)\\n\r\nand unnecessary plot points (the whole episode with gyro for example).\\n\r\nBut above all, it was boring, and I fell asleep watching it.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway story: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nFluid, colourful and bright, the animation is done very well. The large scale battles were animated gorgeously , and they are a joy to watch.\\n\r\nCharcater design wise is a mixed bag. Most of the characters are designed very well, in contrast to the godawful drawings from the manga. However, the chimera ants' design are absolutely horrendous. I know they are chimeras but while I was watching I thought to myself \"Wft is this?!\"\\n\r\nThe design for the chimera ants isn't the animation studio's fault though. The source material is to blame.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe ost is very good, but they do tend to re use the same tracks often so there can be a lack of variety. They also tend to forget earlier songs later in the series.\\n\r\nVoice acting wise, it's done superbly. All the voice actors blend and personalise their characters excellently and they display a lot of emotion and effort as they voice act their roles.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nNow this category is a bit difficult to review and I'll explain why later.\\n\r\nThe main cast consists of Gon, Killua, Kurapika and Leorio, but I'll focus mainly on Gon and Killua. There are other characters, ususally most important on seperate arcs and i will talk a little about them.\\n\\n\r\nGon is a 12 year old kid who is, in my opinion, an improved and more realistic version of kid Goku from the original dragon ball, except for the fact that he's not insanely over-powered.\\n\r\nThis makes it a good and bad thing. Good is that he's not only a more unique take on your usual happy go lucky young male protagonist, but that he's got layers of emotion to his character and has a rock-lee type moral to keep on getting stronger and improve yourself. Gon is steroeotypical and non stereotypical at the same time, and he's a badass little kid who strives on becoming stronger. The negative is that....he's still got a lot of the same thing. Gon can have a rather predictable personality. One minute he's a clueless little kid for comic relief and the other, he's crying when someone dies. He also doesn't get much development until much later in the show.\\n\r\nAll in all he's a decent take on your normal protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nKillua is the white-haired, slanted-eyed guy that's everyone's favourite and rightfully so. He's got a similar, but ultimately different ego compared to his best friend Gon's and he's got layers to his likable personailty and ferocious alter-ego as a darkness-fueled assassin. He's a cool laid back guy that has some serious skill and family relationships. He can seem pretty harmless at first, but piss him off and he'll tear you to shreads. Killua is the one that powers the dynamic and entertaining relationship between him and Gon, and he's a fan favourite character that definitely deserves it.\\n\\n\r\nNow what about the other main characters? THERE ARE NONE. That's right, don't be fooled by the artwork of the anime with gon,killua and the two others (Kurapika the blond cross-dresser and that tall dude with the glasses and suitcase who is Leorio). The other two guys only make appearances in the first arc and the Yorkshin, and then they are forgotten and become irrelevant which is a huge shame and it offends them as characters.\\n\r\nBasically, there's Gon and Killua and then everyone else. Gon and Killua are the only characters prominent throughout the series.\\n\r\nWell, Kurapika and Leorio could be called \"important\" side characters so I'll talk a bit about them.\\n\r\nKurapika is a blond-haired badass who is driven by revenge and everything that Sasuke Uchiha should have been. Because a certain organisation wiped out his clan, he desires to hunt that group down and get his revenge. He's also a complex character with layers to him and he's got one of the coolest powers in the show.\\n\r\nhowever, he only appears in about 40 episodes, which really sucks. We don't know what happens to him when the series ends either.\\n\\n\r\nLeorio is used as a comic relief guy early in the show and portrayed as a bad tempered, money obsessed businessman but he becomes more likable as the series goes on and develops his character with the little screen time he has. Long story short, he is a pretty entertaining and funny character that's certainly not useless.\\n\\n\r\nThe side characters and villains are great in their own right but it still irks me that they don't have much screen time until a certain arc, which is a shame.\\n\r\nKillua's family, the Zoldycks are a group of professional Asassins and most of them have a great and powerful presence and each have a set of their own unique personalities. It's a shame that they don't have much screentime.\\n\\n\r\nNetero, the chairman or, boss of the hunter organisation is a pretty complex guy too- you don't know if he's serious or not, you can't just read him like an open book. He's like master roshi or jiraiya with added insanity.\\n\r\nBisky is a mentor to Gon and Killua and she's a bit of a tsundere with a fearsome alter-ego.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in the chimera ant arc were truly horrible however. \\n\r\nNone of the new hunters in that arc were memorable or likable imho. Moving on.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes the series truly shine, however, are the villains. Whether it is a perverted clown, an evil brother, an insanely buffed steroid- addicted wild man, a calm, but truly evil mastermind or a bunch of powerful chimeras, all are interesting and wild in their own way.\\n\\n\r\n7/10 (for the lack of screentime for certain characters)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: it kinda depends. Some episodes have you on the edge of your seat and some may bore you with more dialogue. However, sometimes I did not enjoy the show simply because it tried too hard to over complicate things and over using narration. Other episodes could be amazing, however.\\n\r\nSome episodes were foreshadowing and building up to later events, and they  range in quality too.\\n\r\nEdit 16/07/15 \\n\r\nI am not saying that hunter x hunter is a bad anime- I'm just saying it's not for me. I thought the first third of it was really good and well written but after the yorknew city arc I just felt it became boring and that it wasn't the same as before.\\n\r\nI know im going to get plenty of hate for bashing the chimera ant arc, but remember it's just my opinion.\\n\r\nBut whatever, you can just be a fanboy and laugh at me for giving naruto and fairy tail higher ratings than the \"masterpiece\" that is hunter x hunter.\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nVerdict:\\n\r\nA good show, but it gets some praise that it doesn't deserve- it's pretty damn overrated.\\n\r\nIt is a pretty well written (for the most part) show with good themes and morals, with good fights and characters. Yes, it can get dreary and over-complicated at times but you can get over it from the entertaining characters and fights.\\n\r\nA major downside was.....the series didn't connect with me.  The story and characters, and the world (which is very extravagant and unique) wasn't very relatable and the entire series is nothing but fighting.\\n\r\nHell, the characters aren't even relatable if I'm being honest. We don't get to see them being real people if you ask me, we only see them fighting.\\n\r\nIf gon and killua and the rest were more fleshed out, the series would definitely be better. They are usually in situations where they have to fight people, it wouldve been nice to see them interacting in normal situations.\\n\r\nAnother problem for me was the lack of comic relief in the later arcs, and also in the chimera ant arc the show tried WAAAY too hard to be dark and edgy, it didnt feel natural.\\n\r\nBasically what i'm saying is everything I didn't like about the series was in the chimera ant arc.\\n\r\n If you want a series focused on battles, this may be the one for you.\\n\r\nHowever, the biggest flaw was the ending.\\n\r\nI know it wasn't the studio's fault but my god it is anti-climactic.\\n\r\nWhat happened to the zoldycks? Leorio? Kurapika? Gon? Gon's adopted mum? The phantom troupe?\\n\r\nWe shall never know.\\n\r\nHunter x hunter is not a masterpiece, or a special shounen which everyone claims it is, but there are a few things that make it special and differenciate it from other battle anime. Now you may think what i said about the negatives of the show are all bs, but remember, it's my honest opinion.\\n\r\nIf I only rated the first 58 episodes of the series I'd gladly give it 8 or 9 out of 10. However, since i need to take all of the arcs into account, my final score is 6/10.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10 (fair)\\n\\n\r\nArc ratings\\n\\n\r\nHunter exam 9/10\\n\r\nZoldyck family 6.5/10\\n\r\nHeavens arena 7/10\\n\r\nYorknew city 10/10\\n\r\nGreed island 5/10\\n\r\nChimera ant 3/10\\n\r\nChairman election 8/10\\n\\n\r\nPlease send feedback if you agree or disagree with my opinion on the show!",

            "content": "Heed my warning and heed it well: If you so choose to watch the gracious series that is Hunter x Hunter (2011), watch it well past the first few episodes. Though the first few episodes make the entire series as a whole seem bland, if you think this way, you're wrong and you should feel bad. Really really bad. Think of it this way: the series is a marathon runner. A good runner prepares himself and warms up for the long arduous journey ahead (ie. HxH). The bad runner carelessly takes off from the start with no preparation and eventually dying down halfway through becauseof poor preparation (ie. SAO, although the first half was somewhat enjoyable, the second half obviously sucked). HxH takes a while to be set in motion, but its part of winning the marathon. Preparation is essential. Listen, give yourself the first 25 episodes, and you'll see that it actually IS good and well worth your time -- and it gets much much much much much much much much much much much much much much much much much much better. Much better. In fact, I created an account with the sole purpose to explain why Hunter x Hunter is a must-watch.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I shall ACTUALLY explain....\\n\\n\r\nStory (10/10): Gon Freecss is a 12 year old boy, and an aspiring hunter with a taste for adventure. Sound familiar, eh? His father, Ging, left the newborn Gon, without leaving many clues to where the father had ventured to. Sound even more familiar, eh? Well don't assume that this is like any other cliched storyline, because it's far from it. Throughout his journey, he gains the acquaintance of Leorio (an aspiring doctor), Kurapika (a special-eyed boy enveloped in a deep vengeance for the killers of his tribe), and soon enough Gon's closest friend, Killua (a member of the highest skilled assassin-family, showing the most potential). Throughout the group's journey, each of the character's story play an essential role in driving the plot forward, and oh how the plot thickens.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is constantly evolving and constantly moving, sparing no slack in pace. If you hate filler, you will love this show especially. It will constantly keep you hooked. If you've just started the series, keep watching I tell you, keep watching. It keeps getting better.\\n\\n\r\nArt (10/10): Now I'm no art aficionado, but I can tell when too bright is too bright and too dark is too dark. All I can is that it's well balance and is pleasing to the eye. Now it's not seizure-inducing like NGNL, but it get's the job done in an enjoyable manner. The palette, uh, looks nice, and uh, stuff. Yeah. There's no \"you're trying too hard\" to be expected in the artistic representation of Hunter x Hunter. Edit: and once you get to the end of the Chimera Ant arc, I give you my solemn word: you will not be disappointed with the conglomeration of art and sound and the overall feeling. No spoilers.\\n\\n\r\n*Sound (10/10): Now this is my FAVORITE part. Part of what makes a series whole is the great sounds that go on behind it. I absolutely adore the music that went on behind the story. It did what I find other series have a hard time perfecting. When intrigue is being produced, music that correctly suits the situation will be presented, and in turn your intrigue will be piqued. When you're on the edge of your seat biting your nails, music adds to that experience. I believe it sets a tone for the story, and does it in an extremely efficient way. However, the only fault is that the music does not fit perfectly sometimes, but it isn't enough to irritate someone. It still gets the job done, and helps steep one's mind into the story further. And possible the BEST part of the sound portion of HxH is the inclusion of Gustav Holst's \"Jupiter\" from \"The Planets.\" It's a beautiful song and it's inclusion in the series legit made me shed a tear m8.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (10/10): No stone is left unturned in the realm of character development. Every character has a specific motive driving them and the drive to accomplish it. There's an explanation for every character's purpose -- and then it develops farther and farther. Think of Gon, the main character, as the main line. As Gon progresses, new characters come into contact with him, creating an infrastructure of development, moving forward at the same pace as Gon. The development only expands around Gon at the same time as Gon ventures about.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10): Need I explain my enjoyment further? The rating clearly declares my sentiment towards the series. The only thing that I DON'T enjoy is that the series is ending at only 148 episodes. That's right, only. By the time you go through the 145 episodes I've gone through, you'll feel how I feel to realize that there's only 148. 148 does not do this series justice. All I, as well as I'm sure anyone else who has ventured through the series thus far feels is that there should be more. and more. and more. and more. There's much more to be explored! Given, there are only 350 chapters (at the moment) of the manga, and the anime finishes quite close. My only hope, and I'm sure I speak for many others, is that the series picks up maybe even a year or 2 later, when there is more of the manga for the anime to run off of -- and not take 10 years to reboot and recontinue. All I can say is we want more, and more is an understatement.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR - Watch Hunter x Hunter (2011) past the first season, instantaneously become addicted, and see why this underrated series should be not underrated nor overrated, but rated with high regard. You will not be disappointed. Just watch it. 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nPS. People who give this show less than a 9 eat children.",

            "content": "I often see people complain about a lack of originality when talking about anime titles without giving it proper thought. The very idea of \"being original\" is within itself a fallacy, especially when referring to any form of storytelling. Everything in one way or another draws inspiration from something else and seeking out \"original\" content shouldn't be an end goal for viewers. What one should look for is how the content itself is presented. A typical story setup is only hindered by the writer and execution of said story. Proper execution and presentation can often be what makes or breaks a show. And even ashow with a formulaic setup can be refreshing if handled properly. \\n\r\nNowhere is this more evident than with Hunter X Hunter (2011). On paper it's a standard fare shounen with all the commonalities and tropes that you'd expect from the demographic. But when presented what we get is arguably some of the best materiel you can ever expect from a battle shounen. No it isn't a \"masterpiece\" like many would constantly proclaim it to be but it certainly reaches ambitious heights very rarely seen with a genre that is usually juvenile at best. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI'll try to refrain from reciting the synopsis:\\n\\n\r\nThe story, like I've already stated before, is nothing special. It can easily be summed up as character driven arcs with each core cast having their own objectives they wish to accomplish. What bring these individuals all together is the highly acclaimed job title of \"Hunter\". The title of Hunter, to save from a long winded explanation, are basically glorified Indiana Jones's positions. Receiving the title and getting the license to be one is like a VIP pass to do whatever the hell you want, may that be bounty \"hunting\", treasure \"hunting\", food \"hunting\", I think you get the gist of it. But the title itself is nothing but a means to an end and obtaining it is only the 1st step for our characters.\\n\r\nDespite Gon being our main protagonist, the story never neglects the core cast that befriends him. Through a given arc we as the audience get a shift in character focus depending on who the storyline corresponds to. Although Gon's journey still remains the overarching one, the others are properly fleshed out to stand on their own without including the MC.  For the most part anyway, unfortunately characters like Leorio never got his chance in the spotlight. With each arc and character focus brings it's own themes and conflict. May that be revenge and redemption as found with Kurapika's arc or self acceptance and discovery with Killua's. Each arc explores a given theme, which made the viewing experience to be more enriched. A balance was struck in it's presentation, making it heartwarming when called for it and awe inspiring when it needed to be. \\n\r\nThe world building and setting was another area that HxH excelled at. Everything felt well structured and was properly established. This is especially true for the show's fighting system known as \"nen\". It was extensively explained not only for the sake of the viewer but also to leave no room for asspulls that's normally common with shounens (looking at you Naruto asspull no jutsu). This intricate in-world power mechanics is only 2nd to that of FMA's mechanics behind alchemy. The various ways in which \"nen\" can be utilized led to some very interesting fights that was entertaining while being well thought out.\\n\r\nThe pacing for the series can be best described as a roller coaster ride. The beginning of the ride is simply a slow climb up to get the participant's blood pumping for the intense drop after they reach the summit. HxH knew how to properly set the stage before the main events happen, something many shounens tend to rush. Since we spend time establishing everything from the setting to the characters involved for the given arc, these well written buildup episodes are what help give certain events substance and weigh behind it. It wasn't just tension-less conflicts between characters, it became something that you got invested in. \\n\r\nOf course nothing is perfect and HxH had it's fair share of missteps. One noticeable one can be seen on an overview. While Gon's story tied most of the arcs together, looking at the content of each arc separately shows a lack of unification among them. They simply weren't thematically related or constructed. We go from tournament arc to revenge arc to \"stuck in a video game\" arc to killer creatures arc. There wasn't any core themes that brought them all together. The transition between them was fine but that never changed the fact that they never quite fit together.\\n\r\nAnother issue that arises was with it's themes. It felt like they could of done a lot more with the material presented. Prime example being the Chimera arc. they skimmed over it but never explored it.  They had the option to use the Chimera Ants in a allegorical way to display themes such as subservience, the human condition and Social Darwinism. Something similar to what they did in Shinsekai Yori and books like Animal Farm. Animals/creatures have always been the perfect proxy for those kind of themes but they never went that route and simply reduced it to cleverly written shounen fights. It was ideas that sounded good but went nowhere or was never brought up at all. No one's expecting a shounen with FMA's level of complexity but it would of certainly been a nice addition.\\n\r\nAlso something else that hindered HxH was it's conclusions. Nothing to do with what's presented itself but the limited material the studio had to work with due to the mangaka Togashi's infamous hiatuses. This results in an ending while satisfying, left many plot points and questions unanswered. The story still wraps up nicely but could of been more conclusive.  \\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nAnimated by Madhouse there should be little question of the show's integrity in terms of animation. Now it isn't anything to write home about or would leave you giving a standing ovation but what HxH have that most long running titles don't is consistency. From beginning to end it never had noticeable hiccups that distracted from the content displayed. It was brightly lit when needed and ominous during times that called for it. A show that knew how to manipulate its color palette to fit the tone of any given scene. And trying my best not to give away spoilers here but episodes like 36 and 116 were prime examples of this. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nPossibly the biggest highlight of the series comes with the characters themselves. If looked at individually very few warrant a character study but as a whole the interactions among them is what stands out. Everyone that's important to the narrative are all given a solid motive to which they strive for. They aren't simply stuck in supporting role, they take an active part in moving the story along. While many of them were fairly common placed archetypes some in particular were actually fleshed out and received actual development. Meruem for example being a character that experienced a catharsis which brought on change in his ideology and perspective in regards to the value of others. This may seem insignificant in other shows but in a genre that reduces villains to being bombastic 1 dimensional megalomaniacs seeing an antagonist with dimensions to his character was very refreshing. Killua being another rare exception for being a character that suffered from an internal strife and inferiority complex. This provided layered characterization to what would normally just be your standard badass. While Gon and a few others remained your dime a dozen characters their organic chemistry is what makes them stand out. (Oh and Hisoka is the best sadistic assassin ever, no this is not debatable, it's a fact lol)\\n\\n\r\nThis is a case where the whole was greater than the sum of it's parts. They were an endearing bunch that showed believable interaction among each other.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nHxH had its slow pacing during buildups and other issues thematically but it's certainly a show I thoroughly enjoyed. It's been a long time since I was ever immersed into a long running shounen and I honestly thought I had outgrew that demographic. But what HxH did that many failed to do was capture that sense of adventure and admiration I had when I was younger. It felt nostalgic, a feeling of familiarity that I only had as a child when watching Saturday morning cartoons. And to me that was well worth the investment.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nHxH is simply a rare breath of fresh air in a genre that has grown stale. It provided well thought out fights, contains a memorable cast and was thoroughly entertaining with lots of jaw dropping highlights. Of course it had it's issues but overall the title had a lot more going for it. As someone that has grown tired of shounens I was quite impressed with what HxH had to offer. It was engaging, it was potent and most of all it left me with a sense of satisfaction upon completion. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "HxH is one of the many overrated shounen anime out there and I can summarize my review with one sentence: \u201eIf you became kinda interested in HxH, because you have heard it\u2019s so much more than just a shounen, don\u2019t believe it, because it is exactly that, just another shounen.\" Now I\u2019m not a fan of shounen, and if you read this review you will find out why, so this anime is not made for me, but just for more diversity in views I will analyze this anime a bit closer.\r\nHxH is one of those anime where you can literally see the quality dropping, withthe earlier episodes being made nicely and at the end it has one of the longest pacings I have ever seen. Since the artstlye isn\u2019t in any form detailed and costly they can\u2019t tell me they ran out of money. I assume they just wanted to milk the cashcow to the end and stretch manga material of 20 episodes(in relation to the beginning) to around 60.\\n\r\nLike I said before the start of the show was quite nice. It had a few things which didn\u2019t really make any sense, especially the riddles, but it had a nice build up and a good pacing. It seemed to me as if the start also really wanted to surprise the viewers with something unexpected, regardless of how illogical it was. It also didn\u2019t do much good in terms of atmosphere, in some cases it even destroys the atmosphere it built up just for surprise reasons. The main characters are also unexplained overpowered, sure there are a few stronger but that alone doesn\u2019t justify a little kid being physically stronger than a well-trained grown up man, just because he \u201cgrew up in the woods\u201d, which is btw contradicted later on. But besides a few negative things to say, the start (first 17-20 episodes maybe) was ok. It had a goal and set motivation from the character side, the main story kinda made sense (more than the rest of the show) and they had some kind of, what the fans claim as \u201ctactics in fighting\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nIn the second arc the terror already begins. Motivations from the character were completely forgotten and not even mentioned in order to have a little conflict for the goal of this arc. The reason for the first arc and what they have achieved was completely pointless and even contradictory as explained in the later arcs. The following arcs shine with, not knowing what to call somethings. For the show an assassin is someone who is physically strong and can endure much pain instead of being stealthy and deadly, the so called \u201cmafia\u201d is a bunch of unorganized idiots who apparently have a lot of power (they at least have a lot of money) which is contradictory in every way and let me question the whole world building of this anime and we still don't know what a Hunter is and does. The writers have no idea of how money works, which wouldn\u2019t be a problem if they hadn\u2019t dedicated a whole arc just for money getting purposes, which later on is also completely useless. Not to forget the story is full of convenience, which goes beyond the acceptable amount.  Some of the arcs are complete filler since they either are pointless or have nothing to do with the final goal (the motivation of the main protagonist). There is even one arc were the main protagonist is inside a video game and literally the first thing he hears there is that being here is completely pointless, but he doesn\u2019t care and goes on anyway, which makes the whole arc pointless and questions the existence of the build up to it. \\n\\n\r\nThis show becomes less endurable from arc to arc, with the mafia arc being an exception but still not good. It\u2019s like comparing a pile of shit with a pile of shit which has a cherry on top of it. Seeing the later arcs lets you remember the earlier ones as if they were in any way good, that\u2019s how horrible this show gets. \\n\\n\r\nHunterxHunter also likes to copy or inlcude everything that was or is popular it seems. That goes from character design (Robocop) even to whole story arcs (the video card game arc which included cardgames like magic the gathering).\\n\\n\r\nA thing that really bothers me as well is the fact that this show has no scale what so ever. The abilities and the strength of every character are so completely random and out of order. It even shifts during the whole anime, making character who should be strong considering their rank utterly weak and character who should be weak unnecessary strong. Its like as if one writer wrote the hierarchy of all the characters and their relationship and then another decided, because how much he liked their appearance how strong they are. \\n\\n\r\nAll of the above was pretty much the first half of the show. The show was like I said very bad but had at least some arcs which were watchable and had a decent pacing. From episode 80 onwards the chimera arc takes place. This is basically the main difference between the original version of the HunterxHunter anime and the 2011 version. \\n\\n\r\nThe chimera arc is the worst thing I have seen in a long time in terms of writing. You can\u2019t take anything they say and do seriously, since the character design is so freaking retarded. They say they are ants but then a penguin and a pink panda in a suit is sitting there with them. NONE of the so called Ant-villains looks even remotely like an ant. The writers wanted to make this arc dark and mature but only showed how childish their writing is. Wow, characters are dying more often now, but that\u2019s about it with all the change they made. As if character dying = mature and dark. This is the most na\u00efve way of seeing it, but it fits a shounen. \\n\\n\r\nIn this arc HxH really shows how little time they spend with thinking through the whole thing. Where villains came from and what their motivation is was never a thing HunterXHunter spends any time in but in this case it makes absolutely no sense that some ant-people who just came into existence are able to be as strong as one of the strongest person in the whole anime. So again.. no scale existend. And with no time spend with motivation and personification the writers now believe they can put drama in the show when the villains die. Are you freaking kidding me? Yeah the ants just killed hundreds if not thousands of people and now I should feel sorry for them? The drama in this whole anime is the worst sort of melodrama, forced and reliable so much on double standarts. \\n\\n\r\nIn the last arc the tactics really shine, in terms of sucking. In the last 50 episodes there is only one fight anyways, so there is not much to talk about, but the tactics there is so utterly idiotic. There is so much bullshit that happened during this arc, there was not 1 episode where I wasn\u2019t facepalming. \\n\r\nBut all of the above would have been minor points if it wasn\u2019t for how boring this whole arc was. The reason I criticize their \u201ctactics\u201d is only because they spend so much time with talking and every fan thinks the tactics are so great. 90% of the time they talk about irrelevant stuff and when it comes to real tactics they are utterly bullshit, convenient or deus ex machina.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters of this show are not in any terms special. Have you seen either Naruto, One Piece, Bleach you know the personality of the main character. Add a bunch of extra typical side characters and you got them all. It\u2019s just the typical teenager character who is strong enough to change the world stuff.  In HunterXHunter they at least  didnt go full overpowered with the main character, but considering the age of the protagonist and the enemies he  is fighting later on I would say its pretty unrealistic. He is a very wish-fulfilling character and not that much of a role model. I think there is nothing really wrong with this wish-fulfilling kind of anime, but they are really nothing for people older than their demographic (in mind of course).  So saying this is more than a shounen is really wrong. \\n\\n\\n\r\nMusic is also pretty bad. All the good songs were copies of famous classical songs, such as Lacrimosa from Mozart\u2019s Requiem, the rest is rather forgettable boring background music. Artstyle is simple and character design in the WHOLE show is the worst I have ever seen, but that\u2019s ofc only my opinion. I found it to be nice to see no cgi, if I remember correctly. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSo overall: This show is not more than a shounen and I might add the worst written shonen I have ever seen, but I am not into that genre so I only saw a few of them. If you are a person who likes more mature stuff and think there is something behind this anime, otherwise it wouldn\u2019t be so popular, don\u2019t fall for the trap and stay away from it. At the end you will just regret it. \\n",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS\r\nOk, before you click on the not helpful button just because I rated this series a 7. Which from what I'm seeing the majority of reviews are dashing out 10/10 left and right. Time to have some variety in these hxh reviews. ;)\r\nFirst thing I'll have to admit is that when I first watch this series it was so goofy, Gon fighting with a fishing rod was such a turn off, I thought this series would be another fairy tale with no dark element in it, oh boy was I wrong. \r\nStory 7/10. The story  starts off with Gon and hissoon to be friends which are Killua, Kurapika and  Leorio who has set out a task of entering the hunter exam to be a official hunter. Now the story does branch off to other sub plots after they became hunters. For eg. Kurapika story which was in the Yorknew city arc, and imo was the best arc in the entire series, it had drama thriller action, interesting dialogue everything in it was perfect. The beginning of this series was quite slow and uninteresting, all the arcs I watch was just good nothing great or spectacular except for the Yorknew city arc, after the greed island arc the chimera ant arc came into play, and imo this arc felt out of place I didn't feel like I was watching hxh anymore, ants coming out of nowhere devouring people and wants to rule the world, so unoriginal. The pacing in the series started to drop the story in my honest opinion was not interesting each episode I watch in the chimera ant arc was just ok, nothing special. I did enjoy the Ikalgo episode though, the mind game was awesome in that episode, there were a few other good gem in the chimera ant arc as well.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10 The art in this series was really crisp and nicely drawn, I rarely saw the art being bad or having bad animation, I think madhouse  did a very good job in this series when it comes to the art.\\n\\n\r\nSound 6/10. This was the weakness part in the series for me, yes, there is some good soundtrack in it, but the majority of soundtracks imo didn't fit the atmosphere or scene of what was happening at the moment in the series. What makes the soundtrack even more disappointing is that they reuse the same soundtrack over and over in each episode. I think they needed more soundtrack for this series. The variety of soundtrack in this series was poor imo.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 7/10. The characters in hxh is good imo. Each characters have depth in them, the only person that felt one dimmensional to me was Gon, overall I can see why a lot of people liked the characters in hxh even the antagonist as well. Also Togashi did a good job in making us hear the thoughts of the characters even the villain as well, this gives them more depth and I think that was one of the major reason why a lot of people got attach to the antagonist in this series, me personally I didn't. The new characters in the chimera ant arc that are on the good side was just too much imo, and I wasn't interested in none of them, except Ikalgo.;) So when I was watching a episode focus on these new character I wasn't interested at all which made my experience unsatisfactory. Too much new characters were introduce at once in this arc.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10. This part is kinda tricky. I enjoyed this series but I also got bored to hell out of it as well, especially in the greed island arc and the chimera ant arc. I was bored to hell. But I think it was balance out. Some episode was just drag out and it felt like nothing happen the pacing imo got slow in the chimera ant arc, which took up the majority of this series, so it affected me a lot on the enjoyment part and also the overall of the series, plus you can factor in things like me not interested in the new characters or the lvl 1 ant characters, not talking about the royal guards if anyone is wondering, which our heroes did have to face.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7.5/10. Overall I had a blast with this series I started to watch it in 2013 so I came in late in this series. This series was overall a good series imo, if you notice I didn't say anything was out right bad in hxh, hxh did a good job in most of these categories, but for me it just did a good job not anything that will make me go \"Woah\" or anything extra ordinary, it was just a good series and it was overall good. I personally think this series is overrated just by seen the amount of 10/10 it's getting and also hxh looks like it will soon to be in the top 5 on mal. Any ways just like everyone else it's just a opinion, and I just wanted to share it with whoever is reading this.\\n\\n\r\nThnx for reading.",

No spoilers in this review.\r\n\tIt has been a long time that I watched an anime that evaluates and explores many aspects of the genre, especially coming from a Shonen demographic anime. While I started watching this series, I was skeptical from the anime by watching the first five episodes, considering that it brings a light-hearted, child-like feel. I stopped watching it for a while because it didn't bring any interesting I found captivating. As time passed by, I doubted myself for not even continuing this series. Many older fansof anime get thrown off by the demographic how anime such as Naruto, Bleach, One Piece, Fairy Tail,etc demonstrate a protagonist in search for glory to become someone important and known to others. Antagonists are shown later in the series soon later confronts the hero in a long-dragging, continuous fight. Eventually, the hero will overcome their goal during a long voyage of his traveling with their friends in either constantly wining in every single battle with their closest rivals, having a bigger ambition to accomplish to become \"someone\" important, or  making a difference in their power level in a outrageous moment while being in a ridiculous, near death, battle..These characteristics of what these series provided hindered me from watching a long, ongoing anime from predictable wins and losses from the Shonen heroes. However, one anime takes all these Shonen tropes and throw it out of the window. That anime is Hunter X Hunter.\\n\\n\r\nStory: The premise of the story takes us to a journey in Whale Island with our hero, Gon Freecss, a young 12 year boy who is destined to become a talented hunter just like his father, Ging, who is a legendary hunter known to many. Hunters are highly skilled professional fighters who have the exceptional ability to lure others into a trap at will, find uncommon creatures at sea or land, or search for undiscovered treasures.  On his quest, he finds other companions such as Killua, Kurapika, and Leorio who also strived to have the same goal to become the best hunter while they participate in the Hunter Exam. This appears to be like a typical, light-hearted Shonen premise in most cases. The pacing in the beginning of the series can commences very slowly for most people. This creates a hindrance with older audience who are used to Seinen type anime such as Monster, Berserk, Gantz, etc. However, gradually, the development of the story arcs within each episodes creates a further relationship between each character in a more complicated situations. While it appears to be a cheerful, humorous at first, it ultimately alludes how each story links up to create a further character development for a protagonist Shonen hero like Gon to overcome mentally and physically especially in the 6th arc of the series, the Chimera Ants Arc. Over the course of the episodes, the arc steadily deconstructs the elements of  the Shonen demographic into a true brutal, psychological nature of what it really means to be a hunter or even a human. As the story progresses within each episode, you will appreciate what the previous arcs has to offer in order to fully understand how the characters feel, hell even the villains' motivations and thoughts as well.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: Madhouse studio did an excellent job adapting Yoshihiro Togashi's (creator of Yu Yu Hakusho) long hiatus manga since 1998 into a more faithful anime adaptation. They keep up with the action orientated sequences fluid into constant beating from facial expression, anticipation, and even suspense. However, some older fans from the 1999 version may disprove of how \"colorful\" art style that the show presented from facial expression and animation wise. But, I'm not going to go into details with the flame war between two series from 1999 and 2011. They also meticulously improved the quality that the original manga drawing lack into a more vivid, watchable experience. For example, the character designs in the manga are considered poorly drawn due to Togashi's long hiatus since his sickness is very challenging overcome for years. This Conclusively, Madhouse excelled Hunter X Hunter manga into a more faithful adaptation it deserves story wise. \\n\\n\r\nSound/Music:  At first, the opening of the anime really suited to the atmosphere and how really addicted the song can really be. Even though the opening theme, \"Departure\" by Ono Masatoshi doesn't change arc after arc, the song becomes a tradition that really suits the mood of the show. It appeal repels me from watching every second of the episode that I couldn't stop watching episode after episode without knowing what is going to happen next. It brings such strong anticipation and curiosity to viewers what is the next moment is about to happen. The music sets the setting of traveling and exploring the world of Hunter X Hunter. It gives off how much is there in the world that is undiscovered. In the future,  people will looked back and feel nostalgic how the atmosphere suits very well in the HxH universe. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: This is where the anime leaves positive note on how well-written the character development really is. While Togashi was writing the manga his hiatus on the manga really makes the story more unique than most Shonen series I witnessed since they emphasis long term fights, rather than a thought-out character development. Gon and Killua are like yin and yang. They build a long, ongoing friendship through the series, learning and knowing their weakness they have to overcome. Not only the main characters have to conquer their own conflicts in each arc, even some minor/supporting characters get screen time in some episode so they wouldn't appear to have a very generic, one dimensional personality. Within each episode, the characters flesh out their morality from what is right or wrong. While in battle, the anime dives into their consciousness on how they can resolve the situation. Tactics and skills play a very important role in the Hunter X Hunter universe. You have to ask yourself, is killing your sworn enemy really going to bring satisfaction for everyone? Can your desire really lead to contentment for your own preservation? These questions lead you to think that the characters are not always what they seemed to be when you start to watch how they first interact each other.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:  Personally, I found this anime to be worth of my time, if not the best. Masterfully well-developed writing. Though-out tactics to weaken an opponent rather than random overpowered abilities for no particular reason. The only downside is the pacing might start off slow in the beginning, but Hunter X Hunter truly delivers what a classic Shonen anime can be without dragging its viewers into  unnecessary clich\u00e9. At first the show starts to grow as an innocent, cheerful child then it matures into a merciless, cold-hearted butcher regarding to the characters' dark past and essential role that will affect them emotionally and ethically later on in the series. Each have their own motives they have to undergo mentally. I enjoy every minute of humor yet complicated growth of each character the series has build to recent episode.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: The anime has surprised me in a so many ways that I just want more from its universe. As of today, the manga is on hiatus due to Togashi's back pains. Who knows when the manga is going to come back? Maybe in two years or even a decade from now. What we know now is that Hunter X Hunter is exceptional to the Shonen tropes that most common anime suffer from. After years of watching anime, I never witnessed of how unforeseen this anime can be from the same demographic as the big 3. For any one that is new to the anime, go watch it now. Be patient and you will gradually be rewarded for one of the best writing you will ever experience in a Shonen anime.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Whenever Shonen Jump releases anime based on a popular manga they are usually for the fighting and story enthusiasts. Hunter X Hunter is a show that balances the two perfectly in the form of a Yin-Yang.  Although this story is fiction, it\u2019s still based on some part of the truth of the real world we reside in. The story is brutal, deep, emotional, breathtaking and much more! A story that is different, but yet has the same basic elements you would expect from a Shonen anime. I won\u2019t go into details of the story or the arc because I can\u2019t mention that without spoilingbut I\u2019m going to express what I can in whatever words while keep it short and sweet. \\n\\n\r\nHunter X Hunter mainly focuses on a Young boy named Gon Freecss who like his father wants to become a Hunter. He wants to experience what the world of Hunters is like and why his father left him to attain the wonders of that world. You can say that Gon wants to look for his father and ask him this question and that sets a goal for the narrative for the anime. Now, with this type of narrative, the Hunter X Hunter universe sets itself to become everlasting much like One-Piece and Toriko, where various arcs can come about without going astray from the initial plot and connect each other with everything else within the medium. You can think of it as a programming flowchart that is always connected to the main command. What really sets the story apart from others is the way it\u2019s told. Its starts of slow, puzzling and full of questions but slowly starts to unravel itself and it gets really interesting as the arcs progress forward. Personally, no arc for me was boring. Every single one of them had something different and unique to offer from the introduction to new characters to foes and bros and new unexplored land which keep everything fresh and interesting. This is something that I feel makes Togashi-sensei such a spectacular author. Another great thing about the series is that Gon isn't the only main character of the series. There are a few more who are later introduced in the series which is what makes Hunter X Hunter special and different which hence makes more room for different types of arcs with different variations.\\n\\n\r\nAs you go deeper into the story you will see how complex, intriguing and thought provoking Hunter X Hunter actually becomes. A lot of the arcs in this show changed my perspective of how I looked at the world and the kind of potential it has of becoming, but at the same time it also made me think about the type of creation we are and negative impacts it brings to the table.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation and sound, this show probably has the most beautiful and the most precise animation I have seen for a long running series. The manga was very lucky to not have been picked by garbage studios like Toei or A-1, instead it was picked up by one of the best ones in Japan, Mad-House. Mad-House studio is known for its amazing animation and to have consistency in all of its long running 148 episodes is a feat. Animation is spectacular. Togashi isn\u2019t a very good drawer when compared to other manga artists but the anime comes and rescues that part of the story. As for OST, it\u2019s pretty good. There are tracks that are pretty awesome here and there and fit the mood perfectly. You will enjoy the animation and sound for this show. I follow some of the staff members who work on Hunter X Hunter at Madhouse Studios and they love this manga very much and they put a lot of effort to make it perfect.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, I know I\u2019ve praised this show a lot, but I feel there is no reason not because, as I see it, Hunter X Hunter is a masterpiece. It is slow to start off with like any other show, but once you get past the first few episodes, you will start to enjoy the show and that\u2019s mainly what hooks a person as he/she starts to gain interest. I always mention this is the reviews and tell people that fighting isn\u2019t everything in a Shonen manga/anime. Sometimes having a good story that keeps the audience at bay and keeps them guessing is what you need in a story and Hunter X Hunter delivers. Over the course of 3 years this show has become my favorite anime of all time and it was sad to see it come to an end. Sure the manga still continues (very slowly) but surely so I hope to see more of it in the future. With that I say good-bye to a spectacular anime which is a MUST watch for all!\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score:  Master Piece (10/10)\\n",

            "content": "What makes a show great? Is it the engaging story? Is it the interesting characters? Is it the immersion the show creates? I find myself always asking these questions whenever I start a series. Hunter x Hunter was no exception. I hadn't heard much when I first started it, but I had heard comparisons to Fullmetal Alchemist and Attack on Titan, both of which are some of my favorite shounens. Still, I had my doubts. \"148 episodes? How could there possibly be that much interesting plot without fillers?\" I asked. I was a fool.\r\nLet me tell you right now, 148 episodes is not enough. Iwould give anything for more episodes of arguably the most outstanding series I have ever had the good fortune of watching. \\n\\n\\n\r\nStory - I'm not going to go into detail about the story; you can read the synopsis for that. I'll instead talk about the storytelling itself. The story starts off fairly interesting and grows exponentially more interesting per episode/arc. The author, Togashi, has an amazing sense of pacing; some plots take several episodes to resolve, but so much happens in each episode that it becomes something that enhances the show. The story is also incredibly immersive because of how well Togashi builds the HxH world. As you follow the main characters on their journey, you learn more and more about just how expansive and unique the world is. There's always something new to explore, which really does make the show feel like an adventure.\\n\\n\r\nEach arc varies in tone. The show starts off pretty light, and gradually gets darker. My god does it get darker. Not to imply that the light arcs are inferior; they're still immensely enjoyable. The show just contains many different forms of entertainment. The darker arcs will include scenarios and scenes of such intensity, drama, and action, that you won't understand how anyone could've possibly waited a week for the next episode. Lastly, there's one element in the story that snuck up on me and transformed into something so beautiful and moving that I simply didn't know what to do with myself. \\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - There are very few ways to adequately describe how brilliantly the author writes such likeable, unique, and interesting characters. And I mean all of them. This is a rare kind of show where every time I see a character come back after not being around, I feel such joy seeing them. Especially the villains - you will love the villains so much that you legitimately will not know who to root for at many parts in the series. The show often develops villains so much that I found myself at times hating a \"good guy\" just because of what they did to a \"bad guy\".\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound - I know this upsets many people but I enjoy watching dubbed anime. However, this is on my short list of shows where the voice acting in Japanese is so good, I'm afraid of a dub being made because I honestly don't think the characters can be done justice. I'm even afraid to watch the original 1999 version because the voice actors are different.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the soundtrack, I don't have much to say. The soundtrack fits the show remarkably well, however there's nothing particularly outstanding about it (save for a few episodes, when a \"requiem\" is played for a certain character for example).\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nArt - The art studio Madhouse really brought their A-game. Their production of this show is almost paramount to how enjoyable it is. As great as the manga is, it wouldn't have been nearly as enjoyable without the stunning artwork and directing that Madhouse designed. \\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - This is pretty self-explanatory at this point. If I could erase my knowledge of any anime and watch it from the beginning, it would likely be this one. Hell, at this point I'd gladly watch 30 episodes of pure filler just to see more of the characters and the world.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nRegardless of the genres you enjoy, Hunter x Hunter is guaranteed to be a breath of fresh air. Togashi seems to have a penchant to subvert almost every trope and cliche in the book, leaving you guessing at every turn. The result is a brilliant and captivating piece of entertainment, guaranteed to captivate you like almost no other show can. Whatever your answer to the question \"what makes a series great?\" is, know that Hunter x Hunter has it.\\n\\n\r\nP.S. Hisoka is love, Hisoka is life.",

            "content": "\"You should enjoy the little detours in life to the fullest, because that's where you'll find things more important than what you want.\" - Ging Freecss\r\nHunter x Hunter 2011 is a unique beast of a show. It sits in a strange limbo between genres in a space all its own, like some kind of odd Chimera of shounen and seinen. At first glance it appears to be a rather childish show, with an art style composed entirely of cartoonish proportions, large eyes and bright colors, which stems initially from Togashi's manga style. In fact, without any outside input, one would not be wrong to assumeit was targeted at children. But under this initial layer of bright colors, and messages of friendship and loyalty, lies a deeper, darker show than anyone could have initially imagined. Questions of what it means to be human, what constitutes a life well-lived, and other topics that would not be out of place in serious adult dramas. One could say that I have stared into the abyss, and I am here to tell you that the abyss has most definitely stared into me.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 10/10. Story telling is really Togashi's specialty. He crafts a continuous and satisfying narrative from start to finish, with excellent pacing, lovable characters, and some entirely unexpected twists along the way. Characters aside, the story itself is fairly straightforward - Gon, the protagonist, wants to become a \"Hunter\" not for the benefits the title confers, but so he can find his father, who abandoned Gon as an infant so he could follow his own dreams (hence the name of the show - Gon becomes a \"Hunter Hunter\"). Along the way, Gon encounters a variety of characters that each have their own relative significance, makes friends and enemies, and undergoes any number of trials and adventures. But this straightforward story is presented and executed in such a way that it feels very organic and comfortable. This comfortable feeling serves as a waypoint during the darker points in the story, a lighthouse of sorts to guide one through the moral murkiness and sadness that the story presents. \\n\r\n          The story covers what is now a total of 7 story arcs, each with their own self-contained narrative. These arcs vary in length greatly - the shortest covers only 5 episodes, while the largest spans a time-consuming chunk of 61 total episodes - over a third of the entire show. But none of these feel out of place - each one seems to last only as long as it really needs to, and none of them feel as if they left too early, nor that they overstayed their welcome. Given that some episodes take 23 minutes to cover 5 seconds of in-world time, this is a marvel of pacing and narration. Some points are slower than others, particularly the beginning episodes of each arc, but at no point does it feel as if it is dragging. This is due in part to the complete lack of filler content - aside from one \"recap\" type episode, each episode of the show presents some kind of story-relevant material, so it always feels like the story is moving forward. All of these factors combined come together to create an overarching narrative that feels very much as if it were adhering to the quote at the top of this review - this is a show, and a story, that focus very much on the journey, the PROCESS of going somewhere, instead of on the destination.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8/10. Madhouse has always been hailed as a studio that produces high-quality work, and this show is no different. It is not always the pinnacle of visual quality, but like the story, the visual quality remains at a very consistent and pleasing level. At no point is it glaringly obvious that they neglected to spread the budget properly. High moments (i.e. the major fight sequences) have appropriately high quality, while those in-between sort of segments maintain a pleasing, but not excessive level of detail.\\n\r\n         My one main gripe with the animation of the show is the amount of time dedicated to hand-to-hand combat in the show. In a show that is predominantly about martial artists engaging in battles, there is a somewhat disappointing lack of choreography. Very rarely do you see two characters exchanging blows directly, even if both of them specialize in hand-to-hand melee combat. This is ultimately not enough to knock a point off of the score, but is something I would have liked to see more of.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8/10. Much like the art, the sound quality stays at a consistent and pleasing level throughout the entire show. Any complaints here are simply my own personal tastes, i.e. I don't very much enjoy the opening song that is used for the entire show, and some of the background pieces that play during the show feel sometimes out of place. But when the music needs to deliver, it does in spades.\\n\r\n          One thing I feel that is worth noting is that the show is obviously very aware of the value of silence. At a few points, there is no music at all, which, I feel, greatly increases the impact of these scenes. Very often now, we see shows that seem to feel as if music must ALWAYS be playing in the background, and when a show goes the opposite direction and uses silence, it creates a wonderful distinction.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 10/10. If the overall story is the bones of Hunter x Hunter, then the characters are the muscles and organs - the \"heart\" of the show. These are the elements of a story that allow us to connect with it personally, to draw parallels between the world that a story presents and our own reality. Inhuman or inorganic characters can completely break the immersion of a story, or if it presents characters that we dislike in a way that feels unrealistic. Togashi excels at creating likable and relatable characters, who each have his or her own (relatively) understandable motivations. The characters develop in a meaningful and noticeable way over the course of the story, lending them a definitively human feeling. Morality is very subjective in this show - very few characters fall into a black and white \"good vs evil\" morality. In fact, I would say that this show does not have a moral \"grey area,\" it has instead a \"moral rainbow,\" a multitude of different motivations and moral scales that interact with each other in an ever-changing spread of different moral hues. We see \"good\" characters exhibit emotional and perhaps even \"evil\" behaviors, while at the same time in a different place, our \"villains\" may be helping to save someone they care about, an action one would normally consider to be a \"good\" action. I would like to believe that this show does not have heroes and villains - it simply has protagonists and antagonists, two parties working in opposite, but equally understandable and justifiable directions.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10/10. I think it would come as no surprise that this is my verdict after the review above, but this is my place to reiterate that I believe this show is a masterpiece of storytelling. To have so many exceptional moments, emotions, and wonderful landmarks packed into 148 episode worth' of show is nothing short of spectacular. Togashi and Madhouse have worked together to create what I think is one of the best stories - not anime, not shows, but stories - of all time. Highly recommended.",

            "content": "Hunter x Hunter has always been one of those anime that looks amateur or goofy at first hand. Yet, behind those innocent faces is a classic tale of an adventure. Hunter x Hunter is more just about becoming hunters and being the best at what they do. Rather, it\u2019s a show about development with a cleverly written story wrapped with a colorful cast of diverse characters. For starters, Hunter x Hunter is a series that invites attention when it comes to storytelling. There are various arcs with characters that can easily be attached for their personalities, abilities, and most importantly\u2026class. As Hunter x Hunter isa shounen series, it\u2019s also an anime that develops beyond just the typical \u201csave the world\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nAdapted from the popular manga series written by Togashi, Hunter x Hunter (2011) is a remake of the original series. Now, it not only has more detailed animation quality but also expands on several arcs that never made itself debut on screen. \\n\\n\r\nThe story tells about a young boy named Gon as he strives to become a professional hunter and find his Father. During his journey, he meets protagonists including Kurapika (a young boy with a dark past), Killua (an assassin from the infamous Zoldyck family), and Leorio (a fellow Hunter candidate hoping to make a career from his journey). Essentially, the series details Gon\u2019s ambition to become a hunter. And to do that, they must go through the torturous Hunter Exam, a series of brutal tests that pushes the boundaries of survival and wit. While this also seems like good old fashioned fun, the series also expands beyond this and gets darker as well as more complex. The Yorknew Arc is a testament example of this as it takes on an unusually mature style of storytelling. The infamous Phantom Troupe (antagonists involved in the arc) serves as a driving factor to how dangerous the HxH world can truly be. Along with that, we also have Kurapika and his quest for revenge against the Troupe for what they\u2019ve done in the past. What makes the show shine itself in this particular isn\u2019t just by the growing more mature style of its presentation but by the driving factors. Surprising twists are revealed and the main characters gets intertwined in way that may change their lives forever. \\n\\n\r\nSimilarly, the Chimera Ant arc also adapts into a more mature style of storytelling. What makes this arc stands out also is not just the typical shounen style battles. Instead, it cleverly crafts its antagonists (the Chimera Ants) including its leader, Mereum, the King. Several of the antagonists undergoes unique changes and their dynamics is reflected by development through relationship building. Most prominently, Mereum\u2019s characterization blurs along the line between human and monster as his development is expanded by his interactions with a human girl. Additionally, Gon\u2019s inner desires to avenge a friend reaches a peak in this arc that will change his character forever. Along with that, the arc is notorious for its violence as blood is spilled, heads flies off, and limbs are blown to pieces. In one triumphant moment, the series pulls off a stunning moment that leaves almost every character shocked and speechless in their words. Maybe you might get that reaction too. With cleverly constructed dialogues and character building, the Chimera Ant arc goes beyond just a fantasy trope of \u2018invasive species taking over mankind\u2019.\\n\\n\r\nCharacterization is important and it comes in all shapes and sizes. The first instance is Gon, an energetic young boy with a whole lot of potential. His friendly demeanor earns him many allies including the cold-hearted Killua. Fearless and putting others before himself, Gon\u2019s true visage comes to his ability to keep a promise. Several instances in the series depicts him shooting for near impossible tasks. But it\u2019s important to realize at the same time that Gon\u2019s actions are not self-motivated but usually for others\u2019 sake. On the other hand, Killua comes off as a socially awkward boy with a head of mischievous ideas. Even so, he is a talented assassin having being trained from an early age in the art by his family. His relationship with Gon is a driving factor as the two becomes similar to brothers. This is very evident during one of the arcs when Killua plays on a very big risk to save Gon from death by consulting with a dangerous individual. Also interesting to note is the very family relationships he has with others. Killua\u2019s family is a group of assassins including his mother, father, and brothers. They treat him differently on individual basis as some sees him as the rightful heir of the Zoldyck name while others wants to control him. The most prominent relationship he has is perhaps with his older brother, Illumi, a talented assassin who has installed fear into the young boy. Throughout the series, it\u2019s interesting to note how Killua deals with the inner struggles of that fear. He faces against powerful opponents such as the Phantom Troupe and Chimera Ants. Sometimes, it feels as if he is fighting against himself when he struggles with his psyche. Nonetheless, Killua\u2019s family is more than just deadly as they held some influences on the young boy\u2019s life.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, not everyone has a family anymore in this show. Kurapika is perhaps a tragic example of this as his clan was murdered. Seeking revenge against the Phantom Troupe, Kurapika\u2019s desire to wipe them from the face of the earth goes to mind-breaking depths. Not only does he put himself in grave risk with his newfound abilities but also his friends as well. The way his character is depicted becomes something of an avenger as we witness how he matures from a professional hunter to a warrior seeking for redemption. As the final main character, Leorio plays more as a support to the team. His role is often overshadowed by the others. Yet, he is involved in several key moments throughout series that influenced deciding factors. I wouldn\u2019t call his role in the show as useless or stale though. Think of it more as lacking the \u201cIt\u201d factor. What this means is that while Leorio lacks moments that viewers will remember him by, his role in the show is noticeable when the push comes the shove. \\n\\n\r\nIn essence, the antagonists of Hunter x Hunter may seem stereotypical. However, it\u2019s easy to see that they can also be complex like a labyrinth. Characters such as Hisoka, Chrollo, and Mereum are prominent examples of this as their motives are often shrouded in mysteries. For instance, Hisoka (a serial killer and hunter) often plays life itself like is some kind of game. He always seeks out powerful opponents and hope that people like Gon would one day by strong enough to become a fruit to be \u201cripped. In certain ways, his role in the series can seem ambiguous as he sometimes tries to get in the way of the protagonists while other times assists them. In the end, it\u2019s all fun and games to the man as he toys with other people\u2019s lives for his own amusement. On the other hand, there are also antagonists that falls under a more stereotypical category such as the Bomber Trio during the Greed Island arc. Genthru, the leader of the trio, serves as an obstacle the protagonists must overcome. And as a sociopath, killing is no stranger in his vocabulary. \\n\\n\r\nHunter x Hunter also likes to play more on mind games but in a more logical way through conversations rather than a typical mind rape trope you might see in some psychological series. The final arc of the series (Election Arc) serves as a way to convey how certain characters talk in their style to characterize themselves and stand out in order to get what they want. Pariston, the Rat Zodiac, is perhaps the most prominent character of this as we see his role. But to say the least, the series\u2019 ability to command presence of this characters to the viewers is through its innovative concepts to adapt. Most of the characters in this arc are also shrouded in mystery. And through this background, viewers will become interested by the potentials they hold.\\n\\n\r\nThe series\u2019 fantasy style comes with in a variety of ways. The lavish lands such as the forest of the Hunter exam or the RPG gaming environment of Greed Island arc are examples of this. Similarly, it can rebound and become more civilized like a more modern setting such as the streets of metropolis of Yorknew City. Nonetheless, the show achieves its purpose by its ability to comfortably shift between settings without going off track. Similarly, the series has a battle system with Nen. Divided into six categories and heavily explored in the Heaven\u2019s Area arc, it follows this concept for the remainder of the series. It\u2019s easily understandable too without getting viewers to scratch their heads because the Hunter x Hunter shows, not just tell. And by doing that, it leaves behind an impression to viewers to understand and appreciate Nen and its ways. \\n\\n\r\nHunter x Hunter isn\u2019t without flaws. While the series is more complex than meets the eye, there are moments when it feels painfully indulging to get through. The first arc (the Hunter exam) may seem slow and dragging at times. Leorio\u2019s role in this arc may easily be forgettable while certain fights will be underwhelming. Certain characters may also be hard to take seriously throughout the course of the series and hard to understand. And while some of the antagonists may seem memorable, others can be a nuisance to get used to. This may even feature a few of the hunters in the show as their roles are diverged after their presence as compared to the main characters. Also noticeable is the repetitive OP song that never changes throughout the show. While this wouldn\u2019t be a problem at first hand, it can feel less appealing. Similarly, the pacing of certain arcs can feel slow. In fact, it can be slow enough that some viewers may distance themselves from the show to come back to it later. In retrospect, it breaks apart the strong development into a weaker focus. Oh and while narration wasn\u2019t a big problem for me throughout the series, certain viewers will find it distracting and needless as it drags out episodes; in particular the Chimera Ant arc. Nonetheless, this is a faithful adaptation of the manga so praise is definitely earned there. \\n\\n\r\nMadhouse is the brainchild behind the anime production qualities. While some parts may lack the classic feeling of the original series, the show\u2019s quality improves by its visuals. Certain scenes are enhanced or remastered to improved quality while others are expanded. However, the backlash might be their lesser faithfulness to certain parts to the manga. Nonetheless though, the series\u2019 quality improves as the show goes on. The character designs are also distinctive such as the case with Hisoka, members of the Phantom Troupe, and the Chimera Ants. Characters\u2019 designs also become more mature and complex such as the case with Kurapika. And as mentioned previously, the show\u2019s fantasy atmosphere is a like a breath of fresh air. Most welcoming of course.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack is decent although some parts lack appropriateness in the beginning and some bits later on. For most parts of the series, the soundtrack is strong and balances well between the comedy and serious moments. Emotional OST is also used during certain episodes to evoke feelings such as during the Phantom Troupe and Chimera Ant arc. Certain theme songs also fits their arcs well for overall impression.  While the OP song remains the same throughout the entire course of the show, the ED song undergoes through various changes. Most of them have its dynamic setup and the \u2018time to get it done\u2019 feeling. Similarly enough, the voice mannerisms of the characters deserves its praise for their portrayal. Their voices not just serves as representation of their characters but also their personalities and development. With such a development, no wonder Hunter x Hunter is more than just a classy shounen.\\n\\n\r\nThe endgame of Hunter x Hunter is not just its battles. In fact, most of the battles aren\u2019t very long or featured as the highlights (except in some cases in a few arcs). Rather, it\u2019s by the structure of its well written story and unpredictable plot twists that will really suck you in for its delivery.  The characters are complex with a style that is unparalleled when it comes to characterization. Not only do the main characters get spotlights but certain antagonists will also be memorable for their roles and development. And with Madhouse being at the steering wheel, you can expect this show to be worth every minute of it.\\n",

            "content": "After years of everyone from personal friends to random internet commentators imploring me to watch Madhouse\u2019s 2011 adaptation of Hunter x Hunter, I finally got around to it. I was told that this was the best long-form battle shounen out there, avoiding all the sins of mediocrity of other Shonen Jump titles like Naruto, One Piece, and Bleach commit. I was told Hunter x Hunter did not constantly try to implausibly escalate the stakes of each battle, didn\u2019t rely on boring clich\u00e9 motivations of characters just wanting to get stronger for no reason, did not draw out its battle sequences for outrageous lengths of time,did not include random unnecessary filler. When I looked more into it and saw that its animation was far superior to anything I\u2019d seen of a similar length, and that it was in the all-time top 5 on MAL. I came into it with somewhat high expectations. I was not expecting a masterpiece, but at least a competently written and directed series that would outpace the mediocrity I\u2019ve come to expect of this genre.\\n\\n\r\nIt turns out, I must not be in on some elaborate inside joke or meme. After sitting through 148 episodes of this I do not see how anybody over the age of twelve could impartially think this series is anything special. The bottom line is this is one of the most completely incoherent, unevenly paced, poorly thought out, and generic series I\u2019ve ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nI suppose I\u2019ll start with my positive notes about the series. First, the animation is noticeably better than just about any series of this length. It got a little slipshod for moments around episodes 100-120 with ill-fitting CGI thrown in now and then, but started and ended strong and was never unnervingly bad. My biggest complaint about the artstyle, which has way more to do with the source material than Madhouse\u2019s artists, is that the character designs are not coherent with each other. With a few exceptions (eg., Hisoka, Biscuit, and Palm) they look fine, but it looks like they were all ripped out of completely different series. However, I suppose that\u2019s a sign of things to come as the plot is also an incoherent mess that feels like several different series randomly crammed together. Another positive note is that the soundtrack which is actually rather exceptional, almost ill-fittingly so considering how weak the series itself is. However, various tracks were over-used and ran somewhat hollow towards the end. Overall, the soundtrack might have been the best point of the series. The voice acting is mostly adequate, with Mariya Ise\u2019s performance of Killua really standing out. I would recommend avoiding the English dub for the most part (I watched about half of the series dubbed), some side characters have really shoddy and obnoxious actors.\\n\\n\r\nThere are also redeeming aspects of character development and plot progression. For the most part, all that stuff I was told about it avoiding the sins most other shounen commit was true for the first sixty or so episodes. The first few \u201cfight\u201d scenes actually felt like refreshing deconstructions of what is so annoying about most shounen fight sequences. For an example, a character would start up some annoying cliched banter about how powerful he was and how he couldn\u2019t be beaten like most scenes from Naruto only to be shut up by a punch in the face. It felt refreshingly well-paced in the first three or so arcs, the main cast of characters were rather endearing, and there was little in the way of boring filler.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, even in the early episodes, it never felt like anything special. I was enjoying it well enough and could see why some people really liked it, but it was somewhat generic and far from a masterpiece. The first arc was a fairly typical exam-style arc, very similar, for example, to the chunin exams in Naruto. It revolves around our main character Gon trying to get a Hunter license through an extremely difficult exam involving a wide variety of off-the-wall, unrelated tasks. The main point of this arc was to acquaint viewers with the main cast of characters and introduce the notion of what a \u201chunter\u201d is. \\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s Gon, a rather endearingly na\u00efve and ambitious 12-year-old trying to earn a Hunter\u2019s license so he can meet his father who abandoned him as a child; a clich\u00e9d lead for a shounen, but adequate. Kurapika, a somewhat ill-tempered but driven character bent on getting revenge for the murder of his people. Leorio, a stock comedic relief character with a somewhat compelling backstory hinted at early on but never explored. Easily the best character of the series is Killua, a 12-year-old former assassin who becomes best friends with Gon early on who is trying to escape his family\u2019s will to turn him into an assassin. Killua and Gon\u2019s friendship (that, at times, arguably verges into canon romance, at least from Killua\u2019s perspective) is really the highlight of the series. Killua\u2019s dark and brooding demeanor, as well as his high skill-level, acts as a perfect counterbalance to the charming but comedically stupid naivety and innocence of Gon. The way Killua is constantly trying to prove to himself that he\u2019s good enough for Gon was the only consistently good character dynamic that kept me watching through this series\u2019 most painful moments. The last notable and memorable character from this early sequence is Hisoka, a wildly underdeveloped possibly pedophilic clown who seems only motivated to someday fight Gon because he wants a challenge (we\u2019re getting into really boring shonen clich\u00e9s) and acts as the series only consistent antagonist, even when he helps the main protagonist. But at least he\u2019s somewhat entertaining with how off-the-wall he is.\\n\\n\r\nTowards the end of this arc, though, you realize that it accomplishes almost nothing in the way of interesting world-building. You realize about fifteen episodes in, with some dismay, that \u201cHunter\u201d is just a term for a generic action-hero mercenary. It mostly turns out this exam is little more than a disconnected variety game show. But, hey, at least the characters are somewhat compelling, if a little bland, and the games are somewhat interesting. At this point, I was still optimistic and I found myself thinking if they flesh out these main characters other than Killua a bit more this could get good.\\n\\n\r\nAs you get into the second arc, the series begins to go a little stale and it becomes really clear just how lazy and bland the supposed worldbuilding for this fictional setting is. After a few episodes of rallying Killua back from his family, which served for some interesting character building, the main four characters split up. Killua and Gon participate in another shonen clich\u00e9 of a battle tournament to get money, as well as pawning some antiques on the side, to obtain a video game that somehow has some hint as to how to find Gon\u2019s dad. The main point of this section is to engage in some worldbuilding around the use of aura and nen\u2014the main fighting mechanic of this series. It renders the first series mostly useless since it turns out obtaining the Hunters license didn\u2019t mean anything, meaning the notion there is not any unnecessary filler here was a lie. The fighting mechanics are overexplained at times and is a rather typical plot device for a shonen, but it gets the job done. This is one of the more boring and forgettable sections of the series, and that is saying something considering the tedium to come. \\n\\n\r\nMore interestingly, Kurapika begins to try to enact his revenge plot against a gang called the Phantom Spiders and we get some interesting development of his character. Eventually, the two subplots of Gon and Killua training and Kurapika getting revenge dovetail as they try to stop the antagonists from robbing. The video game angle is forgotten for about twenty episodes, just one of many times a key plot point will be randomly dropped. Oh, and now Leorio is mostly forgotten, a sign of stupidity to come as he and Kurapika\u2014two of the only compelling main characters\u2014are about to be completely forgotten for nearly 80 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nWhen Gon and Killua finally obtain their video game, the \u201cGreed Island\u201d arc starts. Here, it becomes clear that this is far from what I was promised. Greed Island is easily the worst arc I\u2019ve ever seen in any shounen anime. The basic premise of this is basically the bastard child of Yu-Gi-Oh and Sword Art Online but somehow manages to be worse than both. Almost everything that happened in the first few arcs is completely forgotten, Gon again gets completely distracted from the goal of finding his father and gets sidetracked with the game and another random unnecessary training sequence. Killua acts completely out of character throughout this arc and is almost as na\u00efve as Gon suddenly. Almost every other character from earlier in the series is entirely absent, and an entirely new cast of characters is introduced as well as an overexplained, convoluted new plot device of a stupid card game. The phantom troop from Kurapika\u2019s arc shows up for a minute for no good reason and is then promptly forgotten and Hisoka plays a big role but acts way out of his previously established character.\\n\\n\r\nThe early part of this arc is a bunch of boring exposition spoon-fed to the viewer through badly written explanatory dialogue that needed to be done because the arc had nothing to do with anything before it. This really points to the problem of having such a completely incoherent, unrelated set of arcs: the viewers\u2019 time is wasted with a bunch more exposition when nobody really wants tedious explanation 60+ episodes into the series. It is really reminiscent of how dreary the filler arc at the end of the original Naruto was\u2014but at least those filler serials made some sense most of the time, this arc was as convoluted and nonsensical as it was dull. The worst thing is during one of the most outrageously stupid moments in the history of shonen, a battle revolving around (of all things) dodgeball, all the worst clich\u00e9s of mediocre shonen I was told Hunter x Hunter avoided were on full, proud display. The basic rules of dodgeball are boringly overexplained through narration eight times, the fight scene drags on for far too long, an emotionally-driven power-up by Gon is what ultimately won it, and the antagonist for the fight was built up using boring tropes (such as defeating other characters previous built-up as strong instantly). The main antagonists for the arc were completely boring, unpredictable, and underdeveloped. I barely made it through this arc and almost dropped the series altogether, but was told the next arc was better.\\n\\n\r\nLike the theme song I was now growing weary of told me, \u201cthere definitely is a good reason to persevere,\u201d so persevere I did. Turns out, just like my friends did when they told me this was the best shonen ever, that was mostly a lie. The Chimera Ant arc\u2014which takes up about 40% of the series\u2014was better from the start, but wound up being so horribly executed that it was really frustrating to watch. Killua\u2019s character got some important development with his relationship to Gon. A new rival for Gon\u2019s attention acted as a good foil to Killua. A little bit of somewhat interesting world building is accomplished. I was now really noticing how horridly lazy the worldbuilding was. Apparently the world map is just a flipped version of a real-world mercatus projection, but hey it\u2019s something. Again, this arc has almost nothing to do with anything that came before it, an entirely new cast of characters are introduced, and we\u2019re exposed to even more exposition. However, at least the exposition is somewhat enjoyable this time around. The premise of this arc is that a bunch of killer humanoid ants are killing everyone in one country to try to give birth to a new king, and Gon and Killua join some old friends of Gon\u2019s father to stop it. The antagonists this time around are by far the most interesting and dynamic of the whole series and provide interesting external commentary on human societies. The premise is interesting, it was paced slower but felt well-executed, it was thematically interesting. Around episode 95 I was thinking this series might redeem itself.\\n\\n\r\nThen, the main battle sequence starts and the so-far passable Chimera Ant arc completely jumps the shark. A whole bunch of characters we only got vague backstories on twenty to thirty episodes earlier are suddenly super important so its hard to keep track of what\u2019s going on. The battle sequence is now so drawn-out it makes Dragon Ball battles seem snappy. Seriously, a good twenty episodes into the big important climatic attack on the antagonist, the narrator announces only three minutes have passed. Speaking of the narrator, that\u2019s the worst part about this arc. \\n\\n\r\nAlmost every damn moment of episodes 100-120 is taken up by horribly written, contrived narration. Every move in the battle, every psychological state of every character is just spoon-fed by the narrator. It\u2019s not like the directors were incapable of subtlety, most of the narration was completely unnecessary since Madhouse actually did a decent job at subtley portraying battle techniques and emotional dispositions (although the animation through this arc was the worst of the series). The moment you almost get into the atmosphere of a scene during the battle, the narrator\u2019s there to break the fourth wall and ruin everything, destroying any emotional depth that could be salvaged. The whole point of a visual medium like a television series is to show us characters\u2019 dispositions, motivations, and beliefs, or even the basic events of the plot, not just tell it to us. Otherwise, we might as well forego every single film adaptation of novels and stick to audiobooks. For the most part, this sub-arc felt more like an audiobook than an anime.\\n\\n\r\nWorse yet, the events at the climax of the battle are as implausible as they are ridiculous. Gon\u2019s happy and na\u00efve character fantastically changes way too quickly in to a bloodthirsty sadist during another revenge arc (because Kurapika\u2019s been forgotten for about 80 episodes) as he seeks vengeance for another minor side character we\u2019ve barely gotten to know. The battle hilariously escalates into ridiculousness. Character designs become downright stupid (at one point the antagonists turn into chibis and Gon looks like handsome Squidward with impossibly long hair), fights between minor side-characters we do not really care that much about are drawn out into three episode sequences, and things escalate beyond credulity.\\n\\n\r\nWhen all the dust is settled, eight or so episodes are spent on the resolution to this arc. There are flashes of brilliance here and there, and you\u2019re thankful the narrator has finally shut the hell up. The most notable moment is the finale for the main antagonist of this arc, Mereum, which was probably the best directed scene of the series. It was so high-quality it felt out of place since the animation quality dipped during the battle. Other than that, there were a bunch of scenes that were supposed to be emotionally charged, but so many characters were introduced 30 or so episodes ago with little development in between the viewer is mostly spent struggling to remember who was who and wondering why she should care. It\u2019s a shame, this arc had a lot of potential but it was wasted on fantastically dumb battle sequences and contrived narration to shoehorn in as many new characters as possible rather than actually focus in on the few compelling characters and events in the arc. The most notable half-delivered promise of this arc was the rather rushed development of the main antagonist Mereum which was incredibly compelling before the battle. It\u2019s amazing how the most drawn out section of this anime managed to rush even the most important parts, like Gon\u2019s dynamic change in his quest for revenge or Mereum\u2019s battle between being an ant and a human. But hey, at least they didn\u2019t just randomly forget key characters and plot elements from this arc like they did everywhere else.\\n\\n\r\nThe final mini-arc is when this series just got extremely tedious, boring, and entirely unenjoyable\u2014even more tedious than the drawn-out battle sequence. Gon is injured from the big fight, Killua needs to go retrieve his sister who has some special power to heal him\u2014who at this point we\u2019ve never met and have no clue why Killua cares so much for her if he\u2019s never mentioned her but I guess expecting basic narrative coherence was out of the question at this point. This would be fine, except it keeps getting sidetracked with this tedious political drama about the Hunter organization trying to run an election which is mostly extremely dull bureaucratic dialogue with a bunch of crudely designed characters we\u2019ve never met before who are introduced in a rushed fashion. Remember that infamous scene from the Phantom Menace where they sit in the Galactic Senate talking for too long? Imagine that for about six episodes worth of content. It\u2019s miserable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nIt ends on a higher note. The stupid election bureaucracy fizzles out and it turns out to have mattered even less than we thought it did. Gon gets reunited with his father, which is nice enough. There\u2019s a lack of satisfying resolve in Gon and Killua\u2019s friendship, but after the last 90 episodes of mediocrity, the last 3 or so were stronger. I suppose Madhouse deserves some credit for wrapping up an unfinished manga with a plausibly fulfilling ending.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I do not really know why anyone takes this series all that seriously. This only deserves a small fraction of the hype and critical acclaim it gets. Maybe people are so desperate for a competently animated long-form shonuen that is less than 500 episodes they\u2019re willing to overlook the deep flaws in this show? It feels like a completely incoherent Dungeons and Dragons campaign run by a bunch of ADHD 11-year-olds on crack. Maybe you like the off-the-wall style of storytelling and the way it constantly and implausibly ups the ante on your willful suspension of disbelief. But even if so, it is downright frustrating when key characters and plot points are completely forgotten, when you have to sit through exposition after exposition, or when battles get as drawn out and clich\u00e9 as they do in this series. The only reason it\u2019s not getting a lower score is because Killua is a uniquely memorable and well-developed character, the first 50 or so episodes were at least enjoyable, and it does deserve some credit for being much more visually polished than most of its peers.\\n\\n\r\nConsider how Hunter x Hunter with other long-form battle shounen that are notable for their mediocrity even during its most successful arcs . Compare it to, for example, Naruto or Shingeki no Kyojin. What keeps me hooked on a series like Naruto or SnK despite how deeply flawed they are is that they have coherent, well-defined and interesting worlds into which I can get somewhat immersed. If I\u2019m investing more than 100 episodes in to a series, I want to get lost in the world. I can tolerate implausibly high-stakes battle sequences where the main character is just screaming like in SnK if the setting is interesting and the premise is compelling. I can sit through bland exposition of a new larger cast of characters 200 episodes into Naruto Shippuden if I get a sense of how they fit into the larger narrative in world. \\n\\n\r\nSure, when Hunter x Hunter is at its best in the first third of the series it avoids some of the most glaring flaws of those shows with ridiculously drawn-out battle sequences, spoon-fed explanations, and constant escalation issues. However, it has no sense of immersion or coherent world-building at all since the setting and premise is so generic and never fully fleshed out, and when there\u2019s an attempt to give a sense of setting the elements randomly pulled out of someone\u2019s ass on the spot with contrived narration and usually contradicts whatever came before it. Even the city names are generic, lazy knock-offs like Yorknewcity or Pajing. Gon\u2019s main attack is based off rock paper scissors, for Christ sake. The result in Hunter x Hunter is when the few interesting main characters are absent and I\u2019m forced to sit through more exposition of new characters and battle techniques or when it begins to fall into those bad shonen battle clich\u00e9s during the Chimera Ant and Greed Island arcs, I just lose all sense of interest and watching the series becomes a dull exercise in perseverance. Ultimately, that lazy world-building and lack of coherence makes Hunter x Hunter even worse than most of the mediocre shounen to which it is favorably compared. Paired with the way key points are just dropped and forgotten for good and the cast of characters becomes so large and rushed, the whole series becomes downright frustrating.\\n\\n\r\nAt its best, Hunter x Hunter is a rather unremarkable battle shounen with a handful of memorable characters. At its worst, it\u2019s a completely incoherent, tedious, barely watchable mess. At any given moment, it could be anything between those two extremes. Even though there are a lot of enjoyable moments and some good characters to salvage from the series, I have a hard time recommending this to all but the most hardcore of shounen fans.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 1/10\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10\\n\r\nOverall 4/10",

            "content": "A 10/10 review for Hunter X Hunter 2011 is nothing new on this website: plenty of people have already eloquently described what makes the show such an incredible experience, and for that I'm glad. The show deserves all of the praise that it receives. The reason I decided to write this review, however, was not merely to explain what makes the show so great, it's to convince you to try to watch it. If you're anything like me then the fact that Hunter X Hunter has 148 episodes can be a little daunting: that's a hell of a commitment for a single story. In conjunctionwith this, the show's kiddy art style and first few episodes don't really seem to be indicative of a higher level of storytelling. To top it off, all of those gleaming reviews are a bit of a double-edged blade: going into anything with such high expectations can ruin the experience, and many solid shows have been brought to their knees by over-enthusiastic fans who build them up to be more than they could ever hope to be.\\n\\n\r\nI had all of these doubts when I went into the show. I usually stay away from anything longer than 50 episodes, I didn't believe that anything truly compelling could be spawned from Hunter X Hunter's sugar-coated beginnings and that the show was getting a lot of credit just for having zany ideas and a good sense of humor, and I had heard both strangers and people I respected tell me over and over again that this was the one: the fantasy epic that did it right, that only continued to get better over time right up until its stunning conclusion. If you're feeling any of those reluctances, if you've started the show and just can't seem to be able to get past the first few episodes, know that I was right there with you. Even as the show's first arc came to a close I still didn't consider it to be anything more than \"well thought-out fun\". But dear reader, I URGE you not to fall into that pitfall. I URGE you, if you have any fondness for the world of Hunter X Hunter, if there is any inkling inside you that says \"I might be able to dig this\", PRESS ONWARDS. The reviewers are right and the legends are true: Hunter X Hunter delivers one of the most sprawling, powerful stories of all time. It went in directions I hadn't even considered. It was one of four shows to ever force tears out of my eyes. It delivered powerful stories time and again, and it tied everything together with a conclusion about the meaning of life itself. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the review itself, it seems cheap to merely ride off of the backs of other reviewers, no? Let me give my own two cents at what makes this masterpiece so compelling.\\n\\n\r\nHunter X Hunter is a shonen. It's several tiers ahead of every other shonen I've watched, but it still does have a focus on battles and conflict. What sets it apart is that there's actually usually very little animation involved in the Hunter X Hunter fights: instead of showing the fast-paced high-energy showdown of two characters from the point of view of a third party, Hunter X Hunter takes the internal route. It shows the thought processes of the characters throughout the course of the battle and it makes sure to lay down a tangible battlefield so that you can understand exactly what's happening. Tactics and experience play a HUGE role in combat in Hunter X Hunter: strength doesn't prevail by itself, it's the ability to put it to creative use that makes the victor. Psychological warfare is also a common strategy, with combatants using attitude and knowledge about their opponent to get opponents that may hold huge advantages over them to make stupid mistakes. People don't just fight for the sake of it in Hunter X Hunter: they fight for discernible reasons, whether it be to protect someone or avenge someone or out of pride or stubbornness or fear, and the motivations behind every conflict often play a role in the outcomes themselves. Speaking of which, Hunter X Hunter isn't really all about the \"who wins\" part of fighting. It is rare that it resolves story arcs in straightforward and clean-cut ways, always choosing to honor the choices its characters would make over whatever expectations people may have. This can lead to surprisingly happy and simple resolutions, or it can lead to a morally convoluted clusterfuck that seems to fall apart more than it does resolve itself. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves are one-of-a-kind: in part, this is due to the undeniable uniqueness of their personalities and character designs. However, it's also due to the show's respect for each and every one of the people it introduces. Hunter X Hunter is a forgiving world, where assassins can become heroes and serial killers can command respect and rise to the top. But it's also a harsh one, where people's misguidance can have disastrous consequences and where virtues can be a double-edged sword. In it, everyone has a voice, a goal or goals, a chance to make a difference. Whether it be a previously undeveloped face in the sea of Hunter Exam applicants or an octopus sniper that just happens to be stumbled upon, there are no extras or standbyers in Hunter X Hunter. The ideals of its central protagonists are valued no more than anybody else's, and stories are created and resolved not through convenience but by the show's immense living breathing cast. Each character's story is their own: whatever they may achieve during their time in the show, they have no obligation to stick around for the next phase of the story if they belong somewhere else, and they have no obligation to resolve any of their personal struggles just because the main protagonists are there. Those are something for them to figure out in their own time. What this does is it creates a world brimming with energy and passion, a world where you find yourself simultaneously invested in an unbelievable number of characters because they all feel like individuals, a world where you're constantly on the edge of your seat to see what happens next because 'convenience' has been kicked to the curb. This isn't to say that the show's main protagonists aren't important: quite the opposite, it is their brilliant character arcs that sell the show's ending and create some of the show's most powerful moments. However, the show never gets swallowed by them and it never gives them any more influence on the outcome than they deserve.\\n\\n\r\nThe execution of the show is constantly top-notch as well. Animated by studio Madhouse (famous for shows like Death Note and always able to adapt to the tone of any show), Hunter X Hunter looks absolutely pristine for the entirety of its 148 episode run. It uses crisp, clean lines, bright colors and an indescribable glow to its shots that elevate it in the visuals department while making sure that it has its own unique style: it isn't just \"pretty\"; I could recognize a screenshot from Hunter X Hunter in an instant even if it had no distinguishing characters or story elements in it. The sound is great: the show uses the same opening for the entirety of its run, and oftentimes uses slow instrumental versions of it for the OST during the episode as well. The soundtrack is for the most part a series of the same few songs redone in different ways for different moods, but when the show shifts gears later on into a far grittier and unprecedented arc the soundtrack shifts entirely to reflect the changing protagonists and the alien situations they are now finding themselves in. The voice acting is superb, with a cast that nails the fun and breezy feel of the show but is wholely capable of turning up the intensity when shit goes down. I place an immense value on the literal written dialogue of a show: not just the story or the thoughts behind the characters, but in the way that they interact and their thoughts are portrayed. In this regard more than anything, Hunter X Hunter exceeded my expectations with a script that never dragged and was comfortable and natural switching from long-winded explanations to well-delivered humor to drama and existential woe. Some of the show's most powerful scenes owe themselves to the writing, using just the right words in the right ways to convey what was trying to be said.\\n\\n\r\nDid I love watching Hunter X Hunter? Absolutely. Would I watch it again? Absolutely. Would I recommend it to anyone with even the slightest inkling of a desire to try it? Absolutely. There's only one thing you need to enjoy Hunter X Hunter, and that's an open mind. If you go into its lucrative antics, nonsensical world and over-the-top characters and conflicts with an open mind, you will find one of the most compelling, tragic, powerful and ingenious adventure epics of all time, full of heart and unforgiving to anyone who fails to recognize that the greatest treasure in life is the road one takes on the way to where they are going.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want to see a far more in-depth examination of my thoughts on Hunter X Hunter, I have a spoiler-ridden blog post on my page where I'd be happy to discuss the show with anyone.",

            "content": "My review will start with a short version free of any spoilers, followed by an in depth review containing some minor spoilers.\r\n-Quick overview- (no spoilers)\r\n  To me HxH was a very average anime in terms of my overall enjoyement, with some amazing qualities but also some stinkers. My biggest issue going in to HxH was probably my expectations. A couple friends I had met on an MMO reccomended it to me, calling it the best shonen of all time. At this time I had already finished naruto and bleach, and was up to date on One Piece, all of which i rank 9 or10 out of 10, so my expectations going in were about as high as they could be. I was SORELY mistaken. To me, HxH falls short of the above mentioned Shonen in just about every aspect, especially fights (which for a battle shounen is a big grading point). HxH's strongest aspect, the only area i think it matches the quality of naruto, OP or bleach, is in it's character design. There were some AWESOME characters whom i would of loved to of seen more of.\\n\\n\r\nIn summary, if you go into it without expectations I find it enjoyable but overall average, with the amount of narration in later arcs, and characters from later arcs diminishing my enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\n-In depth review- (spoilers)\\n\r\n HxH was a little slow at the start for me, as is any good anime over 100 episodes. However quickly into the first arc, the hunter exams, they had my interest in full swing. There wasn't anything spectacular in the way of fights, or interesting powers, but they did what any long anime should start with in my opinion; building backround on interesting characters. By the end of the second miniature arc, the journey to the house of Gon's new found friend, killua, I could see HxH potentially being as good as my personal favorite shounens. Killua, his family, gon's dad, chairman netero and hisoka were all SPECTACULAR characters and I was interested to learn more about them and see them in action.\\n\\n\r\nFast forward through to the York New arc, my favorite in the series. Here you are introduced to more members of the phantom troop, almost all of whom I found just as interesting as killua, hisoka and the others mentioned above. This arc is also where the anime started turning dark, but in a tasteful manner, not just a dumb gore-fest for the sake of just cuz, like in the matter of elfen lied.\\n\\n\r\nAnd this is where the anime started to spiral down for me, from an easy 8 or 9 out of 10, down to a 5 or 6. The arc following York New, Greed Island, was hands down one of the most boring arcs I have seen in any anime that I actually enjoyed. The main villain being an all time low for me. His appearance, dialogue and personality were all just very disappointing to me. His one up side, his semi-cool power to blow up things he touches, is then turned flat out stupid, by making it so that he has to explain his power to people for it to work on them. Also while were on the topic of powers, theres this concept of \"self imposed contracts\" where a person makes a contract with themselves in order to make their ability more powerful, this whole idea came across pretty dumb to me, but that's just me. My other issue with the power schemes in HxH are some people's abilities seeming lack-luster (gon) and other people with great potential being ruined (killua). I mean Killua goes from riping out hearts bare-handed, to playing with yoyo's. Granted his godspeed form was awesome and made up for that.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have the Chimera Ant arc..... oh boy. While the arc it's self was solid enough, there were a few aspects that had already started to diminish the show's quality for me, namely in certain people's nen powers (gon and knuckle most of all) and the over-use of narration that seemed to pick up around greed island. At this point any time Gon or a new strong character fought, half the episode was spent listening to someone on the sideline praise the fighter and talk about how gifted they are (in example, multiple times when gon fights you spend several minutes listening to killua talk about how amazing gon is and how he adapts without training). And then the final bullet in the skull to this arc, was the King. Oh my gosh, this is the single biggest rip off I have seen in anime history. One piece, Naruto, and bleach all take many aspects from old greats, like Yuyu and dbz, and adapt something similar in some fashion or another, but the chimera ant king was literally a copy-paste of Cell from dragon ball z. To a T. Both are supreme beings formed from the cells of multiple different organisms, one being done so in a lab, the other in the reproductive system of a creature that consumes a variety of creatures. The appearance is sooooo similar it's just cringy, all the way down to the needle-tipped tail. 0 originality. That isn't even touching on the similarities in personality. Cells first order of business after becoming all powerful, is to test his power against the greatest. The King's first order of business after being born, is to test himself against the greatest minds of different games involving mental acuity, like chess. This all just to kill time while they prepare for his version of the cell games. So both are supreme beings formed from the cells of a variety of organisms and both have a desire to test themselves against the best of the best. And then there's the matter of appearance being a copy-paste.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I thought the show was an 8 or 9 up until the end of the York new city arc, and then the proceeding arc's tanked it down to a 6. Overall worth the watch, nowhere near the best Shonen. Hence it's substantially smaller fan base, as well as quantity of movie and game adaptations in comparison to true GOAT shonens, like OP, Naruto and bleach.\\n\\n\r\nStory 7/10 - Overall good story, however I never felt a serious desire to know what happens next, and the greed island arc really, really disappointed me.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10 - Very well animated, lacking in stunning/spectacular scenes that take your breath away.\\n\\n\r\nSound 5/10 - probably the most subjective of all these catagories, I did not enjoy any of the intros/outros and the soundtrack was so dull I didn't even notice it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10/10 - Because of great character's like the Zuldics and Phantom Troop I'm giving this a 10, although most of the best characters basically get no more than some backround building, and then are ignored as far as the anime goes (phantom troop, hisoka, Killua's family). That, paired with lame characters like Knuckle and some lame power schemes, tempt me to drop this category to an 8.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/overall 6/10 - started out spectacular, dropped insanely during and after greed island. excluding everything post York-New city arc I would give 8/10",

            "content": "Hunter x Hunter could be described as a revolutionary and unorthodox anime in the sense that it is unpredictable, cunning and intelligent, especially when comparing it to other popular sh\u014dnen such as One Piece, Bleach or Naruto. It is a tale which seems to start off as a simple battle sh\u014dnen, yet escalates into an unforeseeable development that delves deep into human psychology, death and hope, in addition to being composed of one of the greatest cast of well fleshed out villains, which is very rare to see in the genre itself. It is a must watch for anyone who is acquainted to the medium.It is a show that can arguably boast of having the best arcs presented in shonens, which is an achievement on its own. With that being said, it naturally has its flaws as well which will be illustrated below in addition to its numerous strengths.\\n\\n\r\n~Story~\\n\\n\r\nThe premise of Hunter x Hunter is simple in nature, the twelve-year-old Gon Freecs setting out to find his father, who abandoned him as a child to become a Hunter. Trying to understand why his own father abandoned him because of his profession Gon chooses to become one in order to find his father. It is a profession riddled with danger, ranging from tasks such as researching species, capturing criminals, searching for treasures or exploring the unknown. What however makes this anime outstanding is the journey it undertakes towards its conclusion, as many have pointed out, with a compelling narrative and fleshed out characters, fantastic soundtrack and animation. It is an adventure enveloped in friendships and encounters with the likes of Killua, Kurapika and Leorio, in addition to countless hardships and the search of what it actually means to be a hunter, an exploration of oneself.\\n\\n\r\nThe narrative is the strongest point of the anime, carrying a powerful analysis of humanity and several messages:  to not group people into categories such as evil or good, friendship and the appreciation of the little things in life. Exposition wise, there is an external narrator at times, which explains in more detail several situations, as well as the characters thoughts, which for some may be a drawback. It presents itself with various types of situations seen in other anime such as tournaments, card battles, thriller and psychological ones throughout its duration, which in some cases don't blend in well with the narrative and the atmosphere. In a way, this breaks the immersion in the story as it often  The story is structured into seven arcs, some huge, some magnificent, others arguably lackluster in comparison. Viewers may observe a progression into a darker atmosphere, whilst maintaining its moments of cheerfulness. Some of these arc are however far from perfect: plot holes, illogical actions, and plot convenient situations happen as well, together with some progression issues. Nevertheless, these could be easily overlooked as these were intriguing, full of suspense and were unpredictable; these can be brutal, where death and mayhem is present.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing of the narrative is overall well done, hardly ever having stretched or rushed scenes, although later on it is apparent that some episodes were affected by these to accommodate the battle intense animation scenes. This affects mostly some episodes in the Chimera Ant arc. The first batch of episodes are mainly dedicated to the introduction of different characters and their respective goals, as well as slowly giving the viewer an image of how the world of Hunter x Hunter might be shaped. Furthermore, as story progresses, more is shown, which is actually quite interesting, as it is pretty unconventional. Being based on current human civilization with all the different flavours within, the flora is much more exotic, with huge trees, which could be said about the fauna as well. Audiences may attribute it to the likes of Dragon Ball in its variety. In addition, there are many places inaccessible for the common folk, only restricted to hunters due to the dangers within that region, which creates a lot potential for the author to work with.\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned earlier, as the story develops, it begins displaying the different things in the world, such as the introduction of \"Nen\", social structure, a great variety of characters including villains, the different political factions within the Hunter Association and naturally, the adventure of the protagonists. However, when the anime begins to explore the psychological aspect, it is where it shines: it dedicates itself  to the analysis of humanity and their nature as a species, as well as themes as cynicism and hope, whilst increasing the characterisation of its cast. These aspect are conveyed through the representation of dictatorship (which audiences may see some similarities to that of N.Korea), political discrepancies among hunters and the government, you name it. The author manages to portray said elements thoroughly, in addition to showing viewers the true beauty of nature and its infinite potential. Through the characters and their evolution, egoism, individuality, selflessness, loyalty and love are portrayed. It also exposes both ally and foe at their best and worst, enhancing the overall experience of the show.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, another important aspect to consider is the battles that are executed alongside the story and its respective techniques and exploration. These are wonderfully relayed to the viewer, being well paced, intense and unpredictable. Another positive aspect is that said abilities are obtained through rigorous training (comparing it to other sh\u014dnens), which nearly eliminates the occurrence of power ups and \"asspulls\". What comes as a surprise however is that the main protagonists are susceptible to defeat, and are not the necessarily the strongest characters in the anime. In fact, the protagonists experience defeat on numerous occasions, creating much more tension when the fighting starts. Nen is also introduced in the anime, which could be considered a superpower to the likes of Chakra or Devil Fruits, or the famous Ki from Dragon Ball. \\n\\n\r\nWhat makes Nen interesting is the endless variety within. What however stands out, which in turn makes Hunter x Hunter somewhat unique, is that the battles are not solely dependent on raw power: intellectual cunning is heavily relied on. It ultimately proposes what true strength really means: power? Intelligence? Speaking of Nen and power ups, the anime sadly suffers some issues, affecting in particular some rules introduced with regards to Nen and its abilities, which was a rather big drawback. This was especially the case when the story was nearing its conclusion, having managed to create an atmosphere where stakes were high, Nen could suddenly be used to obtain ridiculous amount of power, leaving audiences thinking why all the other characters (antagonists in particular) didn't do the same.\\n\\n\r\n~Characters~\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Hunter x Hunter wouldn't be as well crafted without its numerous characters. First of all, let me begin by mentioning that even though they may come over as typical archetypes, these are well-developed characters, especially the main protagonists. Another thing to note is the fact that most characters are susceptible to death, although positive, sometimes is not well executed. This is the case when some characters are introduced, only to shortly afterwards die without any character progression whatsoever, leaving viewers most of the time indifferent. Maybe another thing to note is the fact that the female cast takes a background position: males are of importance.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters that undergo most character development are definitely Gon and Killua. Gon has a cheerful and positive personality, in addition to being egotistical, yet it is clear that he is smart as well; characterised by the use of his fishing rod, he uses strategies that are tied to this, such as sneak attacks, hit and run, you name it, which is quite unconventional. As the story progresses, viewers observe how he grows and get to know his values and personality, seeing his deep affection with life and that of his friends. This deep-rooted loyalty to his friends causes him to cast aside his humanity in one instance. As for Killua, he could be considered the most interesting character, as he undergoes the biggest character development in the whole show. He has a dark past, entangled with his family: he knows no love, nor friendship, he only knows superficial joy. It is apparent that throughout the series he begins to see the bright side of life, in particular that of unconditional friendship, especially during the Chimera arc, where he plays a central role.\\n\\n\r\nThe exploration of other characters such as Leorio or Kurapika are very weak in comparison. A lot of potentiallly interesting characters are relaid to the viewers, yet most of them are left unexplored, or are either forgotten. There are several chaarcters that stand out, yet one should be mentioned, and that is Netero, which no one could ever forget. A cheerful old man, yet very strong, both in his conviction and skills, who lives to acquire the ultimate power. Other characters of interest are Knuckle, seen as a typical \"delinquent\" of the 90's as well as Morel McCarnthy. The Zoldyck family is certainly of interest as well, as these are composed of a great variety of interesting characters, and will play important roles in the events to come.\\n\\n\r\nWhere the anime really shines character wise is in its villains. The villains as a whole can be described as varied, with motives and values. Almost every single one of them is fantastically fleshed out, caring for their companions, which is so rare to see in sh\u014dnen counterparts. As mentioned earlier, the anime proposes to not categorise people into evil or good, which can be appreciated through the phantom troupe, which may seem at first as remorseless killers. This is however clearly visible are the chimera ants, as these may seem \"evil\" for humanity, yet these only act according to nature, which in turn draws parallels with how humans treat other species. In addition, the story often focuses on these characters, rather than the main protagonists who at times take supporting roles, carefully showing the viewer their personalities, as well as developing them through the numerous situations and own struggles with their beliefs. This is especially apparent in both the Yorkshin and Chimera Ant arcs. Villains of note are: Hisoka, the crazy battle hungry clown, the phantom troupe and its respective members, as well as the numerous members of the chimera ants.\\n\\n\r\n~Animation and sound~ \\n\\n\r\nWhile the characters design can be seen as childish and may be a drawback for some, it has a great distinctive cast of characters, which is a huge bonus. This is in addition to the different unimportant characters that have distinctive designs as well. It must be mentioned that some character's design is lacking, in the sense that those are nearly exact copies of iconic characters such as Cell from Dragon Ball. Speaking of animation, it is done by the studio Madhouse. It is very fluid, in addition to its combat scenes, as well as correctly conveying the emotional states of the characters through detailed facial expressions. Backgrounds are well drawn and varied, often befitting of the setting.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors performed their roles well, easily conveying the personalities of each different character. What however stands out is its soundtrack, which is varied and suited the atmosphere it is trying to portray: drums, electric guitar, simple sounds, orchestra, there is really a lot of variety. It must be noted that some of these are either overused or wrongly implemented in some situations.\\n\\n\r\n~Enjoyment~\\n\\n\r\nHunter x Hunter was overall a fantastic experience, with its gripping storyline, characters and soundtracks. Although the story was very gripping, it also had its share of flaws, and some big ones at that, especially when nearing its conclusion. The interactions with the cast are smart and never dragged out either. Furthermore, it is interesting to see how many of its ideas were implemented later on in series such as Naruto for example. Nevertheless, the well paced narrative, well fleshed out villains and its unorthodox approach to its execution, alongside with its psychological aspects, make it easily one of the most entertaining sh\u014dnens out there, which in turn made it very easy to watch a lot of episodes in a session. Hunter x Hunter is highly recommended to anyone who likes sh\u014dnens. At face value it seems like it's targeted to younger audiences, yet the underlying depth to the characters/story will only be appreciated by older audiences.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading.\\n\\n\r\n-Special thanks to the fellow user OnTheShore for proofreading and pointing out mistakes made.",

            "content": "I came to know the original version of HxH since years ago. At first, the only thing I cared about in the series was the Hunter exam. I just wanted to know what kind of test it was so I tried watching it and surprisingly, I loved both the story and the characters after a few episodes. Years later, I was delighted when I heard about the reboot and from start to finish, Hunter x Hunter (2011) doesn't disappoint.\r\nThe story starts with Gon, a 12-year-old boy who sets out for a journey to find his father and his first step is to become a Hunter.A Hunter is an individual who has enough luck and talent to pass the Hunter exam. A Hunter specializes in something, can be practically anything, you name it. A Hunter lives by a power system called Nen in a universe that cleverly reflects the dark side of our real world.\\n\\n\r\nEssentially, being a Hunter isn't special but when it's combined with a well-designed power system and universe, it means infinite possibilities and I have to say Yoshihiro Togashi brilliantly executes that.\\n\\n\r\nThis series has all shounen elements but doesn't follow generic shounen patterns. It begins simply but gradually gets more complex and very unpredictable. A journey of the protagonist and his friends to achieve their goals is as reasonable and realistic as it can get. It has many details, takes time and consists of both success and failure. The MCs don't get a privilege to have special powers or suddenly get stronger for no reasons. They train and evolve as the story progresses. On the other hand, the antagonists don't just act out of pure evil. Their reasons are justifiable in different perspectives.\\n\\n\r\nHxH has 7 arcs. Each one is related but has its own conflict and uniqueness. My personal favorite is the Yorknew arc from episode 39-58. After each arc, the concept of Hunter is explored bit by bit and you will keep getting a bigger picture of the whole Hunter universe. The atmosphere varies from a light-hearted shounen to one of the darkest seinen to fit each arc so it keeps things fresh and intriguing. Each fight is mostly strategic-based and relatively short. It's clever and never defies the logic of Nen.\\n\\n\r\nApart from the story, the best thing about the series is the characters. For me, characters make or break the show and HxH characters are top-notch. They really make the series shine.\\n\\n\r\nMost, if not, all characters and their relationships are realistic because they are imperfect. Not only the MCs, many supporting characters have also undergone a substantial amount of development through the course of the series. Most of them are round characters with distinctive personalities, appearances, backgrounds, powers, ambitions and the ability to think. Their actions are driven by their own judgment as an individual, not what the plot requires them to do so it's very easy to sympathize with them, even the antagonists.\\n\\n\r\nIn term of production, HxH has unique art style with great and very consistent animation for a series that has over 100 episodes. The pacing is satisfying because there are no fillers at all. Voice actors and actresses are suitable for each character. OPs, EDs and OSTs are good even if there is only one opening song so far.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the negatives, there isn't a major problem in the series and all the minor ones i.e. change of narration style and slow pacing in 6th arc, repetitive op song, long absence of a character etc. didn't bother me as much. If anything, I think the only reason you shouldn't watch HxH now is because the manga is still ongoing. Despite a somewhat satisfying conclusion, you could call these 148 episodes a season one and honestly, you will not get a season two, not anytime soon considering the hiatus history of Togashi.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Hunter x Hunter (2011) exceeds all my expectations. I would recommend this series to anyone, especially a shounen fan because I think it's one of a very few anime that is truly remarkable, well-executed and very enjoyable. Watch it and you will understand why this anime deserves its rank.",

            "content": "I never gave Hunter x Hunter more than a passing glance previously. The large episode count, uninteresting story description, and silly looking character designs put me off from watching the show. However, after finally taking the plunge into this series after being given a recommendation, I\u2019m so glad that I watched it. I would have missed out on a true gem of an anime otherwise. \r\nThe anime follows the story of Gon Freecs, a twelve year old boy who decides to take the challenging and highly dangerous Hunter Exam in order to become a Hunter. Those who pass the exam receive a Hunter License whichgives the owner special privileges and status. Gon\u2019s personal goal for clearing the exam is not to get all of the superficial perks of being a Hunter but to be able to someday reunite with his father, who is a Hunter and left Gon at a young age. On his journey, Gon meets both friends and foes and faces various challenges. The story, admittedly, does not sound especially enticing. However, Gon\u2019s journey is filled with twists and turns and often betrays expectations in the best of ways. I found that events often did not play out as I would have expected, but the way they unfolded felt very natural and well written. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime covers seven story arcs, with a trend of an alternation between serious arcs and lighter, more training oriented arcs. The story is one of the strongest points of the show; the writing at the show\u2019s worst is better than that of other shows at their best. One of the later arcs in the show is noticeably darker than the rest and is one of my favorites with regard to story and writing, touching on a variety of themes and ideas that provide some good food for thought. As a side note, the heavy narration during this particular arc seems to be a point of contention among fans; I personally found it to be an interesting method of storytelling, but I could understand why some would not enjoy it. I found the fight scenes of Hunter x Hunter to be another exceptionally notable point regarding the quality of writing. Rarely are fights based around just brute force strength and visuals. Instead, the fights are incredibly enjoyable because of the complex strategies employed by those who are in combat. \\n\\n\r\nThe main characters of the show are Gon, Killua, Kurapika, and Leorio. Gon is upbeat and cheerful with a strong sense of determination, and Killua acts as sort of a foil to Gon, being generally positive while staying more grounded to reality than Gon. Kurapika is an intelligent youth who is out for revenge against those who committed atrocities against his clan, and Leorio is the silly yet charismatic guy, serving as comic relief at times. Of these characters, Gon and Killua, being those that receive the most screen time, get the most character development. Killua, through his friendship with and experiences with Gon, opens up and becomes a less cold individual. Gon has some interesting character development in the latter part of the show, as he begins to face situations that his boundless determination and optimism cannot fix. \\n\\n\r\nThe villains in this show are great, with personalities ranging from calm and collected to quite insane, and I would say that they are more interesting than the protagonists. They are hardly what I would call generic, for the most part, and have distinctive characteristics which make them intriguing characters to follow. The villains are also presented in a way that makes them feel like true threats to the protagonists rather than simple obstacles in the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation in Hunter x Hunter is nothing short of phenomenal. Madhouse did an excellent job with this show; the animation is fluid, especially during fights, and the art is crisp and beautiful. The fact that this high standard of quality is kept throughout the entire show is especially admirable. The actual character designs might not be appealing to some, but looking past that it is hard to deny the quality of this show on a visual level. If nothing else, this show is a treat for the eyes. \\n\\n\r\nI have less praise for the music. The sound track is decent overall, with some excellent orchestral tracks in the mix. However, I felt that some tracks were used far too often to the point where I would occasionally get irritated by some of the music. I feel that an increase in the variety of music used would have benefited the show. Also, the opening theme, featuring two sets of lyrics, is the same throughout the entire show. Departure is a good song, but I think it would have been nice to have different songs for the different arcs. The upbeat nature of the opening doesn\u2019t quite suit the tone of the darker arcs in the show. \\n\\n\r\nI wouldn\u2019t call this show perfect, but it does so many things so well throughout its 148 episode run with nary a drop in overall quality that I cannot help but be amazed.  If you feel hesitant about starting this show because of the art, length, or other petty matter as I was, consider giving it a chance. Keep an open mind, and you might find yourself liking it much more than you expected, as I did. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "\"Gon, you are light... sometimes, you shine so brightly I must look away. But even so, is it still okay if I stay by your side?\"\r\n--- Killua\r\nThis is my second review, so I'm still figuring out the ropes - if you haven't seen Hunter X Hunter 2011, I hope this helps push you toward watching it! And if you have seen it, I hope this helps fill in the void left by the series' ending. As many know, HxH 2011 ended two days ago, and even now, I still kinda tear up when thinking about it. I chose the above quote because I very muchfeel that way toward HxH 2011 - it's an utterly brilliant anime that is sometime too great for its own good, but in the end, I would have given anything to keep watching it - to stay by its side.\\n\\n\r\nI came late to the HxH scene - when I first heard of HxH, I was in a depressive slump in the Fall of 2013, and the series was in the middle of its sixth arc (the Chimera Ant Arc). Hiding from my friends, I was kinda looking for something to just fill my time - what I found in HxH 2011 ended up blowing me away - it lifted me up, restored my faith in myself and in other things, and it helped carry me to where I am now. I can safely say that HxH 2011 has been the most influential anime I've ever seen, and it count myself extremely blessed that I discovered it when I did.\\n\\n\r\nFor the sake of this review, I'll be going through each of the categories, explaining my scores for each one, and then concluding with my final thoughts.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nThe HxH story is EPIC. While I normally hate that word, I can't think of a better adjective for what HxH achieves. The story spans seven completed arcs (the eighth is currently in the works and manga-only), and it covers every possible story type. From romance to drama to intrigue to espionage to politics to adventure to horror to suspense to simply relishing in the power of undeniable friendship, HxH 2011 has something for everyone. The first arc (Hunter Exam Arc) is more exploratory in nature, as it sets the stage for the HxH world and introduces us to the characters. The second arc (Zoldyck Family Arc) really starts to bring the characters to life, as you get to see more into their personalities and hearts, and the third arc (Heavens Arena Arc) ups the stakes and lets us fall even more in love with the characters. The fourth arc (Yorknew City Arc) takes a much darker turn and helps us see the HxH world from a drastically different perspective, and the fifth arc (Greed Island Arc) introduces new plot elements while expounding on the characters even more. The sixth arc gets even darker as it introduces a menace unlike any the HxH world has seen before, but admittedly, this is where some pacing issues come into play. The seventh arc also is a lot slower than the previous arcs, but it is where a lot of the intrigue and politics come into play (albeit, this is why the seventh arc is a lot more serious and seemingly \u201cdull\u201d than other arcs, although I found it fascinating as a political science major). The eighth arc has yet to be adapted to anime, and actually, HxH 2011 ended before they could explore it. Altogether, the story does a wonderful job of keeping you interested and engaged (I only gave it a \u201c9\u201d instead of a \u201c10\u201d because of pacing issues that appear in later arcs), and it leads directly into the next category\u2026\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nIf you noticed I kept saying the word \u201ccharacter\u201d during my \u201cStory\u201d segment, that\u2019s because arguably, HxH 2011 shines most when it comes to its diverse and incredibly-well fleshed-out characters. From the na\u00efve and determined Gon, to the sinister yet sincere Killua, to the blunt yet considerate Leorio, to the vicious but kind Kurapika, each and every one of the main cast is amazingly well-developed and irritably loveable. And this is not to say that each of the main characters is perfect \u2013 if anything, it\u2019s their imperfections that drive them to such great heights.\\n\\n\r\nGon isn\u2019t your typical anime protagonist: while he IS headstrong and innocent, he has a fantastic strategic mind, and\u2026 he gets his butt kicked. A lot. While some have complained about this, I feel that it lends strength to Gon\u2019s character as a whole. While he is phenomenally talented, he keeps finding himself pitted against similarly-talented opponents with vastly more experience than himself. And so, realistically, he wins some, and loses a bunch more. But that gives him an aura of realism. He\u2019s not your typical hyper-powered Shonen character that always manages to win on pure willpower alone. Instead, he\u2019s great (yes), a genius (definitely), amazingly skilled (indeed), but also realistic. And this makes you care about him. When he goes into a fight, you can\u2019t be sure whether he\u2019ll emerge unscathed, or even if he\u2019ll emerge at all. You worry for him, and as you watch him try his best to do his best, you root for him earnestly and with complete genuineness. What\u2019s even better about him, though, is his attitude. He\u2019s always positive, even in the face of defeat, and he always tries to learn from his mistakes. I actually started watching HxH with my younger, 7-year-old brother, since he\u2019s prone to fits of anger and resentment, so I figured it would be good to have Gon as a role model for my brother. And sure enough, my brother constantly felt uplifted by Gon \u2013 he was always saying things like \u201cHe\u2019s so happy. He\u2019s really happy. I wish I was like him. He\u2019s so great.\u201d You can\u2019t help but fall in love with Gon, and as he adventures through the HxH world, you feel that you\u2019re right alongside him.\\n\\n\r\nKillua is amazing as well. He has a viciously dark past, and he tends to lapse into wrong/morally questionable tendencies, and that\u2019s also what gives him a realistic edge. He earnestly seeks to be better, and partly, he wants to atone for the wrongdoings he\u2019s done by serving alongside Gon. As such, we get to watch him traverse through the HxH as he discovers himself, discovers what it means to truly live, discovers what it means to have friends, and discovers how to care deeply for others. Plus, whenever he does one of his cat faces, your heart can\u2019t help but melt (you have to watch the show to know what I mean, haha). So by the time you reach Episode 147, you truly feel the show has ended then and there. I won\u2019t spoil anything, I promise, but even though the anime ended on Episode 148, Episode 147 was the true ending in my mind.\\n\\n\r\nLeorio and Kurapika unfortunately receive less screen-time than Gon and Killua as HxH progress further on into its story. But the screen-time they do get in the first four arcs is magnificent, and it causes you to fall in love with them too. Leorio comes across as oafish and selfish, but he has a completely different side to him that makes the soft side of you cry every time you think about it. And Kurapika comes across as single-minded, but he\u2019s one of the most grounded and well-intentioned characters in the series.\\n\\n\r\nBut HxH\u2019s outstanding characters don\u2019t just end with the four main characters. Indeed, it\u2019s amazing how fleshed out almost all of the series\u2019 characters are \u2013 you come to truly care for all of them. From Hanzo to Beans, from to Biscuit to Goreinu, from Kite to Knov and Knuckle and Morel and Palm and Shoot, from Wing to Netero, from Cheadle to Pariston, from Pokkle to Satoz, etc. \u2013 HxH very much distinguishes itself from other anime by having a tremendous cast of well-defined characters. And this isn\u2019t even mentioning the Ants and the Phantom Troupe and Zoldycks and the Butlers and the Mafia and the Greed Island Players and the Heavens Arena Contestants and the Hunters\u2026 and you\u2019d think that with all these characters, it would be easy to lose track of some. And admittedly, HxH does to some extent. It\u2019s inevitable, really. But aside from the very few that fall between the cracks, HxH manages to paint realistic portraits for all of its characters \u2013 to the point where even if you don\u2019t love them, you still are rooting for them and are vested in them and want to see them succeed and do well.\\n\\n\r\nAnd this extends even to the villains. Never before in anime have I become attached (in some form or another) to almost EVERY SINGLE villain in the show. From the Phantom Troupe to Hisoka (who is possibly my favorite character in the show) to Meruem (another one of my favorite characters), you come to care about the villains so much that you laugh with them, feel shocked with them, and even cry with them. When Meruem\u2019s story concluded in the sixth arc and the anime moved on, I was moved to tears at the thought of leaving behind such an incredible character, even though he was the \u201cbad guy\u201d. And oh goodness, Hisoka is amazing. Just watch the show. He\u2019s fantastic. Trust me. A little weird, yes, but aren\u2019t we all in some form or another? And his villainous side is so\u2026 unique\u2026 that I became instantly fascinated with him.\\n\\n\r\nI could go on about the characters for forever, but at risk of a never-ending review, I\u2019ll push on to the next category\u2026\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nThere is never a single lazy moment in HxH 2011 animation. All of the artwork pops with detail and care and love and diligence. All of the animations are fluid and minutely detailed, all of the characters are distinctive and eye-catching, and all of the vistas are breathtaking and invoke a sense of wonder. Even during episodes that are less action-packed, HxH routinely avoids flashback and pointless/useless filler animation, and it constantly takes the time to intricately lay out a vivid display of visual goodness. Indeed, the artwork is so smooth and amazing and engaging that I\u2019ve come to set a new standard for anime art.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nThe sound in is fantastic. Every visual effect is accompanied by an equally dazzling audio effect, the music is dynamic and invocative, and the ending songs are all great. Some may look at the fact that HxH 2011 uses a single opening song for all 148 episodes as a negative thing, but I like to see it as a huge positive \u2013 I came to fall in love with the song \u201cDeparture\u201d, and now, \u201cDeparture\u201d and \u201cHunter X Hunter\u201d are indistinguishable my mind. If anything, I gave the sound an \u201c8\u201d because while it\u2019s amazing, it doesn\u2019t really stick out in my mind as much as \u201cart\u201d and \u201cstory\u201d and \u201ccharacters\u201d do for HxH 2011. And admittedly, 148 episodes in, it would have been nice to hear a few new tracks added to the HxH  2011 OST. But again, this is a very minor nitpick with an otherwise fantastic score and audio effect reel.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, all of the voice acting is terrific as well. All of the main characters are wonderfully voiced, and all of the supporting characters are just as well cast. Indeed, I can\u2019t really think of any voices that were out of place or not well done. The voice acting is just that good.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nAs I\u2019ve said in the beginning and throughout my review, HxH 2011 is a rollercoaster of feels and thrills. It introduces you to a magnificent world, lines up a host of enjoyable and realistic characters, and then lets you explore it from the pretty to the gritty. No expense is spared in this phenomenal anime, no corners are cut, no cop-outs are taken. And even better, the show does a great job of showing you instead of telling you, although this later lapses in the sixth arc (although it probably would have been impossible to do that arc justice without the telling it gives you, due to the intricate nature of that arc). You get to see and experience and discover the world through the eyes of characters you love and can relate to, and you get to have a blast while doing so. What more could you ask for from an anime? Or rather, what more could you ask for from such a wonderful adventure?\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nUltimately, you\u2019ve probably heard a lot of hype about Hunter X Hunter 2011 \u2013 almost too much hype, probably. And often times, such hype can easily paint a picture of something that\u2019s too good to be true. And if you\u2019ve read this review to the end, then you\u2019ve gotten another massive dose of hype. So instead of reading/hearing more hype, do yourself a favor by ignoring it all and instead finding out firsthand. Go watch the first few episodes Hunter X Hunter 2011. It starts a tad slow, but it quickly builds up, and soon, you probably won\u2019t be able to stop watching. I made it through sixty-some episodes in a few days \u2013 once I started, I couldn\u2019t stop. It was that good.\\n\\n\r\nWhy is it so good? Because HxH truly cares. It cares about its characters, it cares about its story, it cares about its world, and it cares about its viewers. It doesn\u2019t string you along, or set you up for some cheap storytelling tricks, or waste your time. It stays to the point, it does its best to deliver a wonderful tale of courage and adventure, and stays true to itself throughout the whole experience. For that\u2019s what HxH 2011 genuinely is \u2013 an experience. It\u2019s not something that be truly summed up in words alone \u2013 it\u2019s something that must be seen and heard and felt firsthand with Gon, Killua, Leorio, and Kurapika.\\n\\n\r\nSo go watch Hunter X Hunter 2011. I promise you, by the time you conclude your journey \u2013 your adventure \u2013 you\u2019ll be glad you did so. And you\u2019ll wish you could stay by its side for just a little while longer\u2026 :)\\n\\n\r\nAs for me, I\u2019m gonna go grab some tissues and cry\u2026 it\u2019ll probably be another decade before we get more HxH\u2026   :(",

            "content": "This review should help people who don\u2019t know yet if they should watch this series or not. It shall give you a small insight to the series and shouldn\u2019t spoil you in any way. \r\nWhat is Hunter x Hunter(2011)?\r\nSo Hunter x Hunter is a series which is not really new. In fact the anime series had its debut already in 1999. The HunterxHunter(2011) anime series is simply a restart/remake of the 1999 series by MadHouse and is being extended by three arcs. \r\nSince both series adapt the same manga they have somewhat the same content. \r\nBut let me tell you, HxH is not your averageshounen series you might expect. I\u2019ll tell more to this later on. \\n\\n\r\nGon, Killua, Kurapika and Leorio; these are the names of the protagonists you\u2019ll meet in the beginning. In the world of HxH people seek to become a hunter to get more rights, a higher reputation and power. The first arc features these four and shows the hardships of becoming a hunter.  The first three episodes mark a slow start but steadily the series gains the pacing it follows for the rest of the series. In total HxH has 7 animated arcs. \\n\r\nWith each arc we get to know a new set of protagonists and see many different actions taking place at the same time. So Gon, Killua, Kurapika and Leorio are not the only characters you get to see, in fact you might not see some of them for several arcs. That\u2019s typical for the HxH franchise and what makes it interesting.  \\n\r\nI\u2019ve heard from many people things like \u201cit\u2019s not about kids fighting or some bullshit like this, right?\u201d Don\u2019t be confused. On many promotion posters you see covers of Gon etc. and yes, they are kids but this will not bother you. The development of each character throughout the series is remarkable and you will hardly notice that there are actually kids. You will only be reminded of this fact by watching the fighting scenes where their inferiority to the adults is displayed. It\u2019s often shown that Gon and Killua are skilled and strong but they are just kids and lack the power and experience adults have.\\n\\n\r\nIt says \u201cshounen\u201d series, so can I expect that friendship and effort are needed to achieve your goal? Do I get to see some kids fighting and half-hearted action fights? Nope. It\u2019s true through friendship and a lot of effort the goal can be achieved but the fights in HxH are exceptional and well thought. Personally I think the series has a pretty slow start. The first 26-30 episodes should be seen as some kind of long intro. We get to see a lot of action taking place in these early episodes but this is hardly what HxH consists of. \\n\\n\r\nIf I were to describe the tone of the series in the beginning I\u2019d say it\u2019s somewhat bright. The tone changes later on extremely and the series gets darker. Especially after episode 36 we get to know the cruelty and darkness of the society. Don\u2019t think you will not see heads, limbs or blood flying around. This is what HxH truly consists of. \\n\\n\r\nIn many other shounen series we see protagonists fighting and winning the fight through friendship values or who has the bigger muscles. But in HxH we actually witness the hard training Gon and Killua for example have to go through to achieve their goal. The fact that they are kids is indeed some kind of handicap for them. They can\u2019t be stronger or have more experience than adults. But this doesn\u2019t restrain them in any way. Bigger muscles or more power are not needed, fights in HxH are often won through technique and knowledge. There are a lot of characters who are actually stronger and more skilled than the protagonists. Gon for example knows that he has no chance against his opponent but he keeps going on and comes up with a plan to defeat his enemy. This is something that you sadly don\u2019t often see nowadays in shounen series. \\n\r\nI would even go so far as to say that HxH defines the point of the shounen genre anew which as been forgotten in last years. \\n\\n\r\nBut let me tell you HxH doesn\u2019t only consists of action, the comedy deserves its own section. With Gon we have the usually simple- but also broad-minded shounen protagonist. He has a somewhat childish character that is often displayed in the comedy scenes. Killua on the other hand is the one who acts more like a grown-up of the duo. Killua as a descendant of an assassin family is more skilled and acts more reasonable. He actually is the one who comes up with the plan and acts like the brain of the group. There are often some quarrels between both of them which helps to refresh the situation. The comedy scenes always have the right timing and leave you at least with a smirk. \\n\\n\r\nSo what can I say to the music? Without naming anyone I can say the music is another forte of HxH. Throughout the 148 episodes MadHouse used the same opening with different visuals though. The ending changed for each arc and there are some good songs among them. The sound composer has done a good job on conveying the situation by using some epic OSTs. \\n\\n\r\nI should have mentioned this way earlier but I hope some of you are still reading this. So what\u2019s up with the animation? MadHouse had in the last seasons a rise in well-known anime series. The animation is high quality as to be expected of the studio. The character concept got a full revamp: slightly new designs and new voice actors (compared to 1999 version).  Personally I am someone who despises the use of the CGI technique. If it\u2019s not needed it\u2019s not needed. But you hardly get to see any CGI textures or movements in the series. As to be expected of nowadays series, HxH has well-animated effects, surrounding designs etc. The fighting scenes as I said before are what make HxH unique. You can almost see how much love the animators put in the fighting movements. In many series you get to see the, I\u2019d would name it, \u201crubber-effect\u201d where the movements start to melt and you just see some wobbly characters moving (as in Naruto). This is not the case in HxH though. \\n\\n\r\nOne last thing I\u2019d like to mention would be the Nen system. Without spoiling anything, everything that is happening in HxH can be explained through Nen which is a power almost every human can gain through training. This complex system is another forte of HxH and shows how much thought the mangaka has put into his work.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the review I\u2019ve mentioned some other series for comparing. I didn\u2019t intend to criticize them in any way. Every series has its weaknesses and strong points. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\\n\r\nWell, that\u2019s what I think of this series. Hunter x Hunter is a series worth of its rating and should be seen as something that could be on par with the top 5.  To be honest I\u2019ve seen many people not watching this series because of the length (148 episodes). Yes, it is long but worth the trip. You will soon get absorbed by the atmosphere it emits and will enter a totally new world you will surely fell in love with. Trust me you will not regret your decision.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMy rating\\n\\n\r\nStory (9/10)\\n\r\nMusic (9/10)\\n\r\nCharacters (9.5/10)\\n\r\nAction (9.5/10)\\n\r\nComedy (8/10)\\n\r\nAnimation (9.5/10)\\n\r\nDeveloplment (9.5/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall rating: 9.14 (on MAL: 10)\\n",

            "content": "Much like Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, the 2011 reboot of Hunter x Hunter is grossly overrated. This is a show that is definitely a cut above other battle shonen programmes like Naruto and Bleach, but it receives much more praise than it actually deserves. There's this backward-ass mentality here on MAL that causes people to hold shonen programmes to a much lower standard than what they'd hold anything else so when a shonen programme DOES come out that defies various conventions of the genre, it's automatically deemed a masterpiece and ends up in the Top 50 here on MAL. This was the case with Fullmetal Alchemist:Brotherhood, Gintama, and Attack on Titan and now the cycle continues with Hunter x Hunter.\\n\\n\r\nThis isn't to say that I don't like Hunter x Hunter, because I honestly do like the programme. It had this ebullient charm that was lost in the recent sea of grimdark shonen programmes that came out over the last couple of years like Attack on Titan and Akame ga Kill!. This show combined the light-hearted atmosphere of shows like Dragon Ball and One Piece, the wit and humour of Yu Yu Hakusho, and the maturity that came with shows like Fullmetal Alchemist and Rurouni Kenshin. Hunter x Hunter had virtually everything I could ever want from a battle shonen programme along with the kitchen sink. What's more is that when it did decide to drop the shenanigans and take itself seriously, it was able to do so without going overboard. The stakes were gradually getting higher and higher, but it still retained some of the ebullient charm that made me gravitate toward this show in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nThe very concept of \"Hunters\" was also something that I adored the shit out of. Much like the Grand Line from One Piece, the whole concept of Hunters allows for adventures of any scope to go down. We could have an arc that shows what it takes to actually become one of these fanciful Hunters, an arc dedicated to simple fighting tournaments, or we could have an arc where the the fate of the world and humanity as we know it rests upon the shoulders of an elite group of Hunters as they combat nightmarish creatures. The possibilities would've been endless were it not for the fact that Yoshihiro Togashi lack's the work ethic of mangakas like Eiichiro Oda. With that said, Togashi shows that he's more than capable of writing up complex characters, countless artifices, plot twists that actually make sense, and all that stuff. As the stakes gradually get higher and higher, you'll be demanding more because you're hooked and living in suspense is killing you. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, this is the thing that gets my goat with Hunter x Hunter: Yoshihiro Togashi spends all of this time building up your expectations and then instantly shatters them because it's like he gets bored with what he's doing and then moves onto the next arc to do the same exact thing. Take the Yorknew City arc: Kurapika spent so much time chasing down the Phantom Troupe, the villains were all fleshed out really nicely, but what does it amount to in the end? Nothing! Nothing of consequence actually happens by the time the arc is over! Instead of seeing the bombastic conclusion to a story about a person exacting revenge on the monsters who killed his family, we get an ending that reinforces the tired-out cliches of friendship and not becoming the monster that you set out to destroy.\\n\\n\r\nThis isn't even getting into what became of the Greed Island arc because that entire ordeal was something that left a sour taste in my mouth and made me want to give up on watching the show altogether. Gon and Killua go into a video game to look for a trace of Gon's father, but the problem is that Gon's father left a message for him saying that there's no clue to his current location. Right off the bat, Gon and Killua's impetus to play the game was shattered. However, all was not lost because Ging said he wanted Gon to have fun playing the game. You know what? That's a sentiment I could get behind and the entire concept of Greed Island being the ultimate game for any Hunter seemed like would bring about some rather entertaining adventures to watch. Unfortunately, the Greed Island arc was just some pathetic excuse for a survival story with one of the worst villains I've ever had the displeasure of seeing as the focus of the entire thing.\\n\\n\r\nThe Bomber's entire characterisation amounts to nothing more than \"I'm a bad guy and I kill people for fun.\" That in and of itself isn't an entirely bad thing, I mean that's Hisoka in a nutshell too. However, all of the other villains in Hunter x Hunter had a personal connection to the main characters. For example, the Yorknew City arc had the Phantom Troupe and they were the guys that murdered Killua's entire clan. Hell, even the Chimaera Ant arc had Neferpitou who was responsible for doing unspeakable things to a close companion of Gon and Ging's. Bomber lacks any sort of connection like that whatsoever, and so I have no reason to care about what this guy's doing. Hell, he even gets killed off by a bit character once the entire arc is over so that just hammers in how pointless he was to the entire story. This arc could've been omitted completely and NOTHING of relevance would've been lost whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nNow we come to the Chimaera Ant arc, which is one of the most lauded arcs in all of shonen anime and manga. I can totally see why people would adore the shit out of this arc but it's not flawless. Hell... it has multiple problems, all of which come back to bite this show in the ass. The first (and quite possibly the biggest) problem is that the world-building in Hunter x Hunter up until this point was rather non-existent. The only locations we got to see before this point were Whale Island (Gon's home), the Hunter Exam testing facilities, the Zoldyck family estate, Greed Island, and Yorknew City. The Hunter Exam arc established that there's a vast world out there with countless adventures waiting to be told but we never got a good idea of the finer workings of the world that Hunter x Hunter takes place in.\\n\\n\r\nThe Chimaera Ant arc takes place in a place called the \"Mitene Union,\" an island consisting of 5 nations with varying degrees of a turbulent history. This is a complete departure from the previous locations we've experienced before, but the problem here lies with the fact that Togashi brings up all of this political mumbo jumbo into the foray as he also goes along with the story of the Chimaera Ants. For example, we find out that the NGL region where the Chimaera Ant Queen is residing abides by an isolationist, Neo-Luddite culture where anything synthetic or remotely technological is expressly forbidden. That in and of itself would've been more than enough set-up for us but then we learn other irrelevant things like how the NGL was really a front for an international drug cartel and arms-dealing operation along with the founder of the NGL's history via protracted spiels of expository narration. Let's not forget the whole situation with the Republic of East Gorteau among other things as well.\\n\\n\r\nThis is all stuff that would've made GREAT material to work with for other arcs, but the problem is that all of this stuff is being shoehorned into an arc about carnivorous mutant insects. As the Chimaera Ant arc progresses, any sort of extraneous material introduced in this arc that could've made excellent subject matter for future arcs ends up eradicated due to various plot developments and that just further reinforces the biggest question that I have with this arc: why did Togashi even bring up these details in the first place if he wasn't going to use them at all? All of this extraneous stuff about Gyro, the NGL, and other such political nonsense could've easily been omitted from the story completely and nothing of consequence would've changed.\\n\\n\r\nOn that note, the pacing of the Chimaera Ant arc is absolutely appalling. It took Yoshihiro Togashi NINE YEARS to actually finish this arc because he was going in and out of hiatuses and those protracted breaks he took whilst writing up this arc really do make themselves quite obvious. The anime excerbates this problem by slowing down the pacing of the arc from Episodes 113 through 120. If I'm not mistaken, Togashi was on yet another hiatus when these episodes were being produced so Madhouse was close to running out of material to work with. Whilst I can understand why they intentionally slowed down the pacing of the arc at that point in time, they chose the absolute WORST place to slow everything down. Our team of Hunters were in the middle of invading the Chimaera Ant King's castle and right when the invasion starts, the pacing slows down to such a degree to the point where I'm wondering if I'm watching Gantz again.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, that comparison was a bit too hyperbolic but the point still stands. Madhouse chose to adopt a psychological approach to the whole invasion but that's the problem: THEY WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF A FAST-PACED INVASION THAT WAS CRITICAL TO THE PLOT. The psychological approach to the invasion would lend itself better to manga than anime as a medium. For seven back-to-back episodes, the pacing of each episode was slower than the flow of sand in an hourglass. I don't care if we got to see what was going on in their heads during such a crucial moment of the story, I wanted to see Gon and everyone else haul some serious ass! To me, there's nothing quite like the lingering feeling of dissatisfaction that stems from being denied my fix of fast-paced and enthralling action and unfortunately, Hunter x Hunter denied me my greatest pleasure multiple times over the course of 148 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nGoing off on a bit of a tangent, another problem that the Chimaera Ant arc suffers from is the way Yoshihiro Togashi handles the darker and more complex themes he brings up. The Chimaera Ant arc brings up themes such as survival of the fittest, human nature, and all that stuff but its execution is rather heavy-handed to say the least. I think it's safe to say that Togashi lacks the sort of tact that mangakas like Inio Asano and Naoki Urasawa have when it comes down to tackling darker and deeper themes in a particular work. Instead of operating on two levels where you can either take the story at face value or choose to analyse it further and then draw parallels between it and other things like Monster and Oyasumi Punpun does, Hunter x Hunter opts to just outright tell you \"this is happening, and I want you to know that I'm trying to draw parallels here.\" The whole thing just reeks of pretension, and it just gets really irritating after a while.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, what really made me dislike the Chimaera Ant arc as a whole is the fact that this is the arc that took that ebullient charm that Hunter x Hunter had from the very beginning and just eviscerates it completely. I have no problem with shonen anime/manga going into darker and deeper themes (that's one of the reasons why I love the Jinchuu arc from Rurouni Kenshin), but seeing Hunter x Hunter go down the grimdark path that so many other shows in recent years went down just never sat right with me. What really drew me toward this series in the first place was the fact that it was a light-hearted and fun shonen programme that still had the capacity to take itself seriously without losing what made it fun to watch in the first place. By the halfway point of the Chimaera Ant arc, the entire show just became tedious and boring to sit through to the point where I stopped caring about what would happen next. That's no exaggeration either. I honestly had no strong feelings one way or the other by the time that the Chimaera Ant arc ended and when the entire series ended as well. Sure, both the arc and the series had a fair enough conclusion but they still don't excuse the fact that this show has some really serious problems.\\n\\n\r\nThe world-building was mediocre and it really shows in the Chimaera Ant arc (given that there's so much expository narration), the storytelling repeatedly builds up your expectations only to fail completely at delivering something significant, and many promising characters end up being thrown to the sidelines. Nen as a battle system is intriguing as it's simple and practical, and yet the limitations of Nen are sometimes disregarded completely. For example, Kurapika's a conjurer but if his eyes turn red (and he's learned to change his eye colour on command), he's able to use the other types of Nen at full strength (can you say \"asspull?\"). \\n\\n\r\nGoing back to the characters, I've found myself getting frustrated with them so many times. Gon was never really that good of a character to begin with, as he immediately struck me as an imitation of kid Goku but with the ability to differentiate between a man and a woman, but that was forgivable since I still found myself really liking him. Unfortunately, the Chimaera Ant arc had him turn into a complete and total psychopath as he threatened to kill an androgynous cat person/ant thing because it was in the middle of saving a critically injured blind girl. I know that Togashi was trying to show what happens when you let the pursuit of revenge get the better of you, but there's a fucking limit.\\n\\n\r\nKillua on the other hand was quite a delightful character and when Gon was too busy being the bad kind of homicidal maniac, Killua was the one I'd turn to to get some entertainment value. His sarcastic demeanour and approach to virtually everything made the show that much more entertaining to watch, and what's more is that of all the characters in Hunter x Hunter, he's pretty much the only one who's changed in any significant manner from Episode 1 all the way to Episode 148. Whilst that's great for Killua, I can't help but feel like the rest of the time in Hunter x Hunter could've been better spent developing other characters.\\n\\n\r\nLeorio was a character that I really wanted to see more of, especially given that his motivation for becoming a Hunter stemmed from the desire to save his (now deceased) childhood friend from a curable illness whose surgery cost an exorbitant amount of money. That's an amazing motivation to become a Hunter, and I get the feeling that he could've accompanied Gon and Killua on their adventures as a medic/mentor kind of character. Unfortunately, he just HAD to be relegated to comedic relief. Am I the only one who takes umbrage with the fact that comedic relief characters in most shows nowadays have awesome backstories and ultimately end up getting screwed over because they have to be the designated idiot? This is a trend in anime and manga that REALLY needs to stop because it's so fucking annoying.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters in Hunter x Hunter are more of the same. We have countless awesome and likeable characters like Knov, Morel, Knuckle, Shoot, Bisky, and Palm (did I forget to mention that Palm's da waifu?) but the fact that they're all introduced and developed in the Chimaera Ant arc doesn't really feel right to me. To me, it seems like all of these characters should've been introduced in earlier arcs so that we could've had more time with them and then develop a greater attachment to them. I could easily see Morel and Knov being instructors during the Hunter Exam arc, among other things but that's hindsight talking. I swear, retrospect is the worst enemy of everyone, isn't it?\\n\\n\r\nGoing away from the story and characters, let's talk about the production values. I don't think it's any stretch of the imagnination to say that the Hunter x Hunter manga has some downright terrible artwork. I mean, Yu Yu Hakusho isn't anything to write home about from a visual standpoint but the piss-poor quality of Togashi's artwork in Hunter x Hunter is just plain inexcusable when we KNOW he can do much better. Thankfully, Madhouse took the piss-poor artwork of the manga and made it look good. Character designs were cleaned up or partially redrawn so they don't look like complete and total garbage, the backgrounds look much better with colour and shading, and what's more is that the animation across the entire show is quite lovely and remarkably consistent. Then again, this IS Madhouse we're talking about: their stories might be hit and miss, but their production quality will always be some damn good stuff!\\n\\n\r\nTheir sound work however could use some work. I have no problem with the voice work or anything of the sort. What really makes Hunter x Hunter annoying for me (at least from an audio standpoint) is the opening theme. I never liked it, and the fact that they kept the same OP throughout all 148 episodes is something I take umbrage with on so many levels because it just grates on my ears. What's more is that the all of the EDs that Hunter x Hunter had would've been PERFECT openings: they're all fast-paced, energetic, and just get you pumped to see the next episode! Seriously Madhouse, WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS?!?! On the other hand, the rest of the OST has some rather nice BGM to it. My favourite track though would have to be \"On Whale Island\" but that's just my shit taste talking. There is no dub to speak of at the time of writing, but I wouldn't put it past a company like Viz Media or Funimation to license this show and then give it a dub since it's one of [adult swim]'s most requested programmes.\\n\\n\r\nFinal thoughts? Well, Hunter x Hunter is a show that definitely does get a lot of stuff right and it certainly is a cut above the more typical shonen programmes but it certainly isn't perfect. How this show got into the Top 10 here on MAL is beyond anything I can comprehend. Then again, this website has baffled me more times than I can count. As it currently stands, Hunter x Hunter is one of the many shows on my list of shows that I started out adoring the shit out of that ultimately ended up disappointing me. On the flip side, it's nowhere near as disappointing as Nagi no Asukara was but let's not get into that. Anyway, that's all for now. Feedback is always welcome and with that, I'm gonna barricade my house so that the rabid HxH fans can't kill me. Peace :)",

            "content": "THIS WILL SURELY BE THE LONGEST AND MOST IN DEPTH REVIEW I HAVE EVER DONE.\r\nForgive me as I try to collect my thoughts and review this epic masterpiece of an anime.  As tears rolled down my face during the final episode's conclusion, I realized HunterxHunter's true greatness.  The way the series drew me in with its endearing cast, and brought me on a roller coaster thrill ride for 148 episodes was me experiencing something truly pure and un-replicated in the medium.  That is not to say it's without its flaws, but the overall reward from HxH is something gratifying and magnificent. Andof course, there are spoilers to be had here. \\n\\n\r\nI will admit, when I first went into HxH I had a fair amount of hype because Yu Yu Hakusho was my favorite battle anime ever made.  I just loved the constant growth Yusuke underwent during the franchise's 100 plus episodes.  The similarities in writing from Togashi are clearly present, but they do nothing to detract from the uniqueness HxH possesses.  Oddly enough, with such a staggering amount of episodes, HxH contains virtually zero filler.  Instead, the series is delicately divided into 6 independent arcs, which all  focus on completely different methods of storytelling ranging from the suspense thriller Yorknew City arc to the dark and defeating Chimera Ant arc.  The series literally touches on everything: politics, humanity, tournaments, failure and video games.  Perhaps even more impressive is that it manages to do all of this without ruining itself with unneeded romance or fanservice.  \\n\\n\r\nSure, I will be the first to agree that HxH does not have a strong start.  The Hunter Exam arc is actually my least favorite in the entire show, but that's not to say it wasn't necessary.  Togashi uses this arc as a way to develop ties to the main characters and establish its roots.  It also gives an introduction to one of the most unpredictable characters in anime history, Hisoka. I wouldn't say I was necessarily bored with the beginning of the series, but it wasn't something I was binge-watching straight through. I stuck it out in part due to my love for Yu Yu Hakusho and for the respect I had for my friend's recommendations.  The positives of this arc are the necessary character developments and diversity in events within the exam itself.  Also, the first time Hisoka went on a killing rampage, I knew this wasn't any ordinary kid's shounen.  The negatives would be the pacing and how Killua didn't recognize Illumi's needles while he was posing as Gittarackur.  Illumi's reveal shouldn't have come as such a surprise when it occurred.  When Killua's composure snapped, it again reinforced the actual target audience for HxH.  The way Togashi can border innocent and playful dialogue with such sinister and bloodthirsty themes is eloquent to say the least. \\n\\n\r\nThe Zoldyck and Heaven's Arena arcs are probably the closest thing HxH has to filler, but again, these arcs are an integral part to progressing the story and introducing both Killua's past and the life energy many of the skilled fighters have in the series... also known as Nen.  I almost feel like Togashi used the tournament avenue to introduce Nen out of need to fill his Hakusho void.  As many remember, the Dark Tournament arc from Yu Yu Hakusho was hands down the greatest tournament style arc in anime history.  I understand that climbing the steep ladders of the heaven's arena wasn't necessarily the focus of the arc, but I would've liked to see a little more fighting that would've transpired later in the tower.  It was also requisite to invite the viewers to peer into the secluded life of our assassin MC, Killua.  This introduction intrigued me, and made me even curious as to how Killua would eventually face his brother again after the Hunter Exam.  As the show went on, I was slightly disappointed that Gon and Killua's Nen instructor and apprenticed never reappeared, but other than Bisky mentioning him in the Greed Island arc, their paths just didn't cross.\\n\\n\r\nNext came one of my favorite arcs of all time... The Phantom Rouge or Troupe arc.  Finally, we were able to understand the seething rage Kurapika endured from having to recount the loss of his family and tribe due to those notorious, ravenous killers.  This arc is also the point at which the show really begins to pick up.  I was ecstatic to see massive character development in Kurapika's case, and also to see Gon and Killua take on more of a supportive role. I remember the scene when the Troupe heads into the auction hall and obliterates everything in sight, my jaw dropped to the floor.  HxH's writing surpassed a level I didn't believe was even possible in a facade of a kiddy shounen.  Not to sound morbid, but I was transfixed.  Enthralled by just how much I was starting to enjoy the series' variety, and ho Togashi wasn't afraid to transport it away from a stereotypical shounen.  I kept thinking, \u201chow do more people not talk about this show?\u201d What unfolded in the next 20-30 episodes kept my finger trigger happy on the skip button as I couldn't get to the next episode fast enough.  The fight scenes in this arc, although fewer than I hoped, were entirely cerebral and constantly shocked me.  In particular the battle between the ten dons and how effortlessly and grotesquely the paralyzed Uvogin dispatched them.  I couldn't believe I was still watching the same show.  \\n\\n\r\nDespite my immediate attraction to the Phantom Troupe arc, I still had a few small issues with it.  In a self-centered \u201cperfect\u201d world, I would've liked to see the arc taken further.  Once Chrollo's Nen was stifled, the arc was basically over.  I've never been a fan of plot conveniences, and it almost seemed as though Togashi got bored with one idea and meandered towards a new one.  Needless to say, the fight between the Zoldycks and Chrollo was brief but intense.  I would've also liked to have seen Nobunaga and Franklin in an actual one on one fight to fully explore their abilities.  The majority of the Troupe just feel like abandoned characters.  However, this might facilitate itself as a necessary evil in a series was such an enormous cast as HxH has.  Also, Hisoka never gets his rocks off by being able to battle Chrollo, the entire reason he falsely represented himself as a member of the Troupe in the first place.  This was another notch in Hiskoka's complexity however, since it's sometimes hard to pinpoint his alignment or rationale.\\n\\n\r\nThe Greed Island arc was more than likely my favorite behind the Chimera Ant and Troupe arcs.  There was something about it I was fond of.  Maybe it was the small break it had in the tense action of the preceding Troupe arc, or the sense of discovery or exploration it contained.  As an avid gamer,  appreciated the subtle nods it contained to the MMO world, and this added yet another notch on HxH's belt of variety.  I quite enjoyed the introduction of Bisky, although her true ability and past is not fully explored.  I believe she saw a part of herself in Gon and Killua, and took it upon herself to provide them with the highest quality training she could in the short time available.  I did have an issue with the villain of the arc, The Bomber.  Not only is he improperly developed, I found it very hard to believe he was as strong as Togashi alluded to.  And if that was the case, couldn't Bisky have disposed of him with ease?  At any rate, the Greed Island arc was a nice break from the intensity of the previous arc, and a qualified precursor to the series' longest arc.\\n\\n\r\nThe Chimera Ant arc's greatness is constantly debated among HxH fans.  On one hand, it explores humanity, self-identification and features some of the most cerebral battles of any anime I've come across.  On the other, there are some severe pacing issues and blatant disregard for some major role-playing characters.  I personally enjoyed the arc, but I threw caution to the wind when it came to criticizing it.  In retrospect, I can understand the issue many people have with it.  After some research, I discovered that some of the odd pacing developed because Madhouse was waiting with bated breath for their best animators for a future episodes.  This left a few episodes when the heroes invaded the Ant King's stronghold narration heavy and quite boring.  It certainly had the DBZ effect for awhile, and I was left slightly confused.  I also find it hard to believe that Hisoka didn't make his presence known upon the Ant King displaying his immense power.  Since Hisoka was so fixed on fighting the strongest person he could lay his eyes on, I was sure he'd emerge in this arc.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the few negatives I have with it, the Chimera Ant arc is nothing short of spectacular.  The amount of themes explored is staggering.  Sure, most animes probably would've taken the safe route and made Meruem some sort of bloodthirsty tyrant with zero regard to humanity.  But the introduction of Komugi certainly turned the arc upside down and changed Meruem's view of humans entirely.  The way the inner monologues were written during his Gungi battles was inspiring and refreshing.  I was certain the King would end up vanquishing everything in sight, but he saw more than just brute strength as a display of power.  Man, Togashi didn't dissapoint again.  Killua's transformation after Kite perished was also uplifting.  As my favorite character in the series, it was exciting to see Killua break away from his brother's burden and play such an integral role in saving the human race.  Lastly, Gon's transformation, although some would be quick to criticize its \u201cconvenience effect\u201d... I thought was well constructed.  The effects his brief, immense power had on his body were believable and warranted.  It also reinforced the type of person and Nen user Gon was in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nThe last arc, although slightly rushed added a nice bow to the magnificent anime.  I thought it was unnecessary to introduce 12 new characters so close to the end, but I guess the new Chairman selection served as nothing more than plot support for the more pressing issue at hand, Gon's recovery.  I actually thought (well, hoped) that Killua and Illumi were going to fight in this arc, but I guess we can't all be pleased.  Leorio's reappearance was refreshing and reminded me how much I enjoyed him as a character.  Most importantly, after Gon recovered, his father/son moment was everything I imagined it would be and more.  Ging look flustered but quickly adapted to talking to his son, who was so much like him.  When the closing sequence played after Gon and Ging laughed and shared stories atop the World Tree, I actually bawled.  I'm not ashamed to admit it, I had the same reaction when Yu Yu Hakusho concluded.  When you devote so much time to something, it's sad but satisfying to see its conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nGiven the staggering amount of characters that HxH contains, I'll try to focus on the ones I feel are main.  Gon, as a main protagonist initially worried me due to his immature personality and blinding trust in others.  However, as the series progressed these qualities became part of his strengths, and his development and growth was made possible through his unparalleled tenacity and heart.  Many people seemed to have issues with his \u201cfound\u201d power when he goes to fight Pitou, but this accurately illustrates an equivalent of \u201cmaking a deal with the devil\u201d.  Gon had gone through so much in order to find out why his father left his home to become a hunter, and while he never received an explicit answer, the journey leading up to meeting Ging made the answer irrelevant.  In contrast, the feelings I had for Gon at the anime's conclusion couldn't be farther from my initial observations.  \\n\\n\r\nKillua was my favorite character from the HxH franchise.  His calm, somber demeanor is contrasted greatly by his murderous capabilities, the quintessential assassin.  His rebellion from his family was strengthened by his unadulterated relationship with Gon.  The two were essentially brothers, and Gon helped Killua unearth emotions he previously felt weren't present in his own body.  His transformation was amazing to witness, and his quarreling relationship with his brother Illumi made the change that much more impressive.  My favorite quote from Killua was \u201cIf I ignore a friend I have the ability to help, wouldn't I be betraying him?\u201d  It really shows his growth as a character throughout the series. His inner monologues always made the show more enjoyable and really offered a perspective often omitted from most series out there.\\n\\n\r\nLeorio was a fan favorite and was unfortunately missing from the show's biggest arc.  His enthusiasm and vigor, although sometimes unnecessary was a joy to watch, and I wished he played a larger role in the overall story.  From what I understand, he plays a much larger role in the manga and gets the \u201cscreen time\u201d he deserves.  Kurapika also initially rubbed me the wrong way, but steamrolled into the limelight during the Phantom Troupe arc and reversed my opinion entirely.  Again, he was another character completely left out of the later arcs, and I find it hard to believe that he wouldn't be willing to help out Gon and Killua if the the fate of mankind was actually at stake.  Instead, we were left with odd shots of him looking stressed out in front of multiple pairs of scarlet eyes.  Hisoka was probably my second favorite character, as he was clearly an atypical villain.  You didn't always root against him, as part of me really wanted to see him go all out in a 1 on 1 against Chrollo.  Sure, he gave off a pedophilic vibe and often pissed off the wrong people, but it was refreshing to have an antagonist who had some depth and wasn't one-dimensional.  \\n\\n\r\nThe music in HxH is uplifting, suspenseful and \u201cmostly\u201d well placed.  There were a few instances of misplaced background music, but nothing major.  It was irregular but refreshing to see the same OP though the entire anime.  I can assuredly say that a year from now when I hear this OP, I'll probably choke back tears of nostalgia from how powerful it was to me.  The ED's were mostly additive, with the exception of the one in the Greed Island arc.  I mostly preferred the first ED as well as the Chimera Ant arc ED due to the contrast it had to the subject matter within each episode.  Perhaps the most enjoyable aspect of the sound was the voice acting in HxH.  Every voice seemed to emulate the portrayed character pefectly, most importantly in Mariya Ise as Killua and Keiji Fujiwara as Leorio.  Hisoka's VA also performed brilliantly and left an overall creepy aura over his persona.  There was rarely an awkwardly casted role in HxH at all which led to the relatability of the characters.  \\n\\n\r\nIn summation, I thoroughly enjoyed HxH for everything that it was.  Whether it was for the endearing and complex characters, or for the intellectual battles the respective characters consistently found themselves in.  Mix that with the engrossing environments, real-life themes and incredible voice acting and music, and you'll find yourself immersed in a shounen for the ages.  Maybe I'm still drunk on the aftershocks of the series, but either way it was truly a masterpiece.  It really baffles me as to how small the fan base is for HxH, as it is clearly superior to most (if not all) long running shounen out there, and it contains nearly every necessary element for success in the genre.  Nor is there any filler.  I mean, what more could an anime fan ask for?  I only wish that if the franchise is rebooted in anime form that Togashi exercises the same level of finesse he did with this series, as it is one that will remain one of my favorites for years to come.  I plan on eventually watching the 1999 version at some point, but I'd better let my Togashi high rest for a little while.  While not a perfect 10 due to some minor issues I had, HxH is pretty damn close.  As always, thank you for reading!",

            "content": "Hunter x Hunter is one of the best anime I've seen. It's my first time writing a review, so it probably will be super disjointed.\r\nTo be honest, the art style put me off from watching it, because it's not what I usually like. But, every other aspect of the anime made up for it. After watching a few episodes, I got used to the art and started to like it.\r\nStory: 10\r\nEven though it's a super long anime with 148 episodes, the storyline was always full of surprises. There is a mixture of action, emotion and romance. One moment I was crying, and then the nextmoment I was filled with tension. This anime contains aspects from all kinds of genres.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nLike I said, the art isn't really what I prefer when I watch anime. But, I came to like it after watching a couple of episodes. There are times when the characters look cute; there are times when they look super duper scary. But, overall, the art is quite likeable and I quickly adjusted.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nThe sound was absolutely amazing. I really liked the OP and even set it as my alarm- it has this really refreshing and powerful feeling. The sound effects throughout the anime was really varied, and I mean this in a good way. Every single scene in the anime was supported by the perfect background music, and this made the storyline even more powerful. But most of all, the sound when people were hurt or killed was really scary. I've lost track of the number of times I cringed from the sound. Basically, the sound really did an excellent job in supporting the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nSome of you might be thinking, WHAT? How can you not give a 10 for this section?! Certainly, each and every character deserves a 10+++++ rating. Whether the character was good or bad, I found myself becoming emotionally attached to every single one of them.\\n\\n\r\nOops this might be a spoiler.. Like Knuckle would say, \"Each and every one of them had a good heart.\"\\n\\n\r\nIf someone asked me to pick my favourite character, I don't think I'd be able to. It's just that hard to make a decision.\\n\r\nThe reason why I give character a 9, rather than a 10, is because of Gon. There's no doubt he is a super amazing protagonist. However, so many aspects of the anime made me overestimate him. Every time I thought he'd do something great and heroic, he didn't quite live up to what I expected. This probably sounds like a selfish judgement, but it's true.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nNo doubt about it. I watched 148 episodes in around a week. If that doesn't explain it, then what will? I enjoyed every single bit of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nHunter x Hunter (2011) is the best~~",

            "content": "Okay, so Hunter x Hunter is praised a lot so I gave it a chance. After watching it I think it's the most overrated anime ever, even more than SAO and SnK which are often called overrated. This review is probably more a salty rant intended towards people who have already watched Hunter x Hunter rather than people wondering to watch it, but I'll try too many spoilers.\r\nTo clarify, the only real start bias I had was that I didn't watch it until now because I'm not a fan of the art style. \r\nI will mostly talk about the story since that's what I seepraised the most but I'll go over the different points that MAL uses. \\n\\n\r\nStory: To summerize what I thought about the story; It started good at gradually became worse, reaching the bottom at the later stages of the Chimera Ant arc. There will be a lot of indirect spoilers, so if you want to be spoiler free don't read further than the first part.\\n\\n\r\nThe first arc, Hunter exam arc, was actually very interesting especially since I have read/watched many long mainstream battle shounen such as Naruto and One Piece. It's very clear how they influenced each other and share a lot of traits which I found very interesting to examine, in fact Hunter x Hunter might be the basis for the Naruto Chuunin exam arc, however I'm not sure which was published as manga first. We realise there's a lot of different types of hunters and we see some cool creatures in this fantasy world, I'm a big fan of the big turtle/dinosaurs. This is the only arc I would classify as a fantasy adventure. I had trouble understanding why people would call HxH a masterpiece but at least at this point I liked it.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's the Heaven's Arena arc, where the shit begins. The story stops being anything about adventure, now it's just fantasy battle. The battles are more or less pointless, the only purpose is to train the main characters power like going to the gym or pressing the \"Train\" button in an sim dating game.\\n\r\nWe are introduced to \"Nen\", which is actually very confusing at this point because we've seen nothing at all to it until this point. They're introducing a very abstract and foreign concept where only one of the 4 concepts Nen consists of has any exposure before this and only very little in Gon's usage of zetsu. \\n\r\nThen Nen is divided into 6 categories and then there's a persons unique Nen ability... Then there's the advanced Nen techniques etc etc etc... It feels like an endless addition to a battle system which is made up on the spot. \\n\r\nFrom this point everything besides Nen basically becomes irrelevant which is honestly a shame. \\n\\n\r\nYorknew city arc starts very interesting, but towards the end it gets really silly and bad. The Phantom Troupe which is supposed to a group of the worst criminals in the world actually fights for the power of friendship and ends up sacrificing more than the main cast to save the lives of their friends... I don't have an issue with the power of friendship, but it's not very cool and intimidating when they care more about their friends than the main characters. This was probably to show that the bad guys aren't flat 100% evil people but in this case I just found it lame. Besides that we are also introduced to more useless characters.\\n\\n\r\nLastly I'm going to talk about the Chimera Ant arc. Honestly, I think this is the worst of any anime I've ever watched. It starts quite interesting by being dark and almost apocalyptic. However it quickly just feels out of place in this bright anime where friendship prevails and leads to 0 consequences. However it switches rapidly between overly serious and extremely silly which I at least found very disturbing. One moment we got chimera ants trying to take over the world where the cast considers if they should be treated humanely or as monsters (which was done poorly imo) and then we got some of the monsters with abilities called sexy stinger and the last bosses having an orgasm while they feed their liquid (Nen) to their leader for 10 minutes.\\n\r\nThe pacing was monsterous slow, even worse than the worst parts of mainstream anime. The narrator made it a living hell, explaining everything pointless and the arc included so much useless information. It clearly felt like this arc was drawn out to be as long as possible. \\n\\n\r\nArt: Honestly I'm not a fan of the art. The art style/character design is older and very simple, which is something I don't like. Gon has a nose sharp enough to cut fruit, the characters pretty much wear the same clothing 24/7 and their style is imo too simple, plain and boring. There was never a point where I thought \"Hey this design is pretty cool\" or something similar. The colouring in the anime in general is pretty nice though.\\n\r\nThe animation is good in general and better during important fights, but especially towards the end there's tonnes of loops and still images which only serve to keep the budget low and extend the episodes to be as long as possible. \\n\\n\r\nSound: I think the soundtracks are good, very good in fact. However I think they're used very poorly and there's not very many. Maybe this is due to not paying attention but I can only remember around 6 soundtracks, which were played over and over. Something which especially annoyed me was the soundtrack they played every time Nen was involved. \\n\r\nThe voice actors did good though and sfx was also good. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: I like some of the characters but aside from this, I think the characters are quite poorly done, especially Gon. (For reference I liked Hisoka, Illumi & Killua)\\n\\n\r\nGon is very straight forward like most shounen MCs however he's slightly different because he's far more childish (and stupid). His stupidity is on a different level which made me hope that the other characters would somehow break him so he could learn. But no. Every stupidity he performs is rewarded and comes without any real consequences. During the hunter exam he refuses to give up despite being totally outclassed and threatened with getting every limb broken? Break all his limbs and spit him in the face please. Not giving up can also trying again even if you fail rather than just being stupid. Also during the Greed Island arc. There's a plan to defeat the Bomber (who is equally silly) but let's not follow it and lose an arm first before following the plan. And then the arm regrows because magic!.. And then when he becomes angry and big, the consequences of doing that are alsog one because of... MAGIC! Or well basically because of magic. Everything he experiences and mistakes he makes are without consequences, even what happens to Kite is reversed in the end...\\n\r\nGon doesn't grow, he's equally stupid and irresponsible during the entire anime. Also his early defining traits are totally gone later in the anime. First of all, his fishing rod is magically gone after the Heaven's Arena arc which was one of the things that made him unique. Secondly his ability to hide due to his upbringing in the nature is non existant after Yorknew City. You could at least make him enhance his fishing rod.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's Killua. I actually like Killua, he's actually thinking. He actually grows a bit, learns about friendship and how to take risks (or at least they say). However like Gon he begins to lose his individuality, just not as much. During the Greed Island arc for instance he pulls out his yo yos which we've never seen before. Then after he learns to use his lightning properly then RIP yo yo's. His past as assassin doesn't influence how he fights during the later parts of the series which I think is a shame. He was exposed to electricity torture as a kid so his power is electricity! Feels a bit silly imo. Also why not like use the lightning with the yo yos? \\n\\n\r\nAnd then we got the rest of the cast where most are irrelevant to anything besides the single arcs they got any real screen time. \\n\\n\r\nI think a lot of potential was wasted overall with the characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Some parts were more enjoyable than others. During the especially bad parts I had to look actively for bad stuff to be able to find any kind of entertainment or enjoyment in the anime. \\n\\n\r\nExtra stuff: I read a lot of people say they enjoy the strategy in the fights, but having the characters/narrator explaining what happened after the action doesn't make it into strategy/tactics. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime was the most extreme case of people explaining their abilties, strategies and etc. to the enemy. There was even a character with an ability which required to know the name of another's ability. Why would you even need to name your abilities?\\n\\n\r\nAlso the anime even encourages to defy logical solutions and plans. The characters might say their plans are super important to follow and should be priority but pretty much all characters don't follow the plan and act on emotion. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: Well since the worst arc (Chimera Ant arc) imo filled around 40% of the anime I would say overall Hunter x Hunter is bad 3 or 4/10. If we talked about actual content and not in terms of amount of episodes it would be a lot higher. Aside from that arc I would say HxH is alright, but definitely not a masterpiece. It is everything I see people complain about when it comes to other anime. If you think it's a masterpiece, you're not wrong, I'm just unable to understand why. \\n\\n\r\nTo sound like a review I would recommend this to people who like Index. It shares a lot of the same problems imo but a lot of people also like index so maybe what I consider a problem is a virtue to others.",

            "content": "148 episodes is a lot of time to invest in a series..Only a good series can justify that much time..And HunterxHunter not only justified it,but it basically blew away any pre concieved notions i had about it...Before starting this anime,i was really skeptical mainly due to the lack of mainstream hype..Surely if it was THAT good,it should have recieved more attention,right?I couldn't have been more wrong..HxH is without a doubt one of the greatest animes I've seen and after finishing it i'm left with a deep sense of loss..Anway,here's the more detailed review:\r\nStory:\r\n10/10\r\nThe story is mainly about Gon and his journey to find his father..Hisfriends Killua, Kurapika and Leorio and the three protagonists besides Gon.. There were hardly any filler episodes as far i remember..Once I started watching,I couldnt stop till the arc was complete..The story picks up pace at the correct intervals while slowing down whenever necessary to add character depth..There were no plot holes and all ends were nicely tied up at the end of each arc leaving me with a sense of satisfaction\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\n8/10\\n\r\nFor me  the art was very good...It wasnt the best I've seen but it was nonetheless pleasing on the eye...The fight scenes in particular made a big impression on me..So 8/10 for the Art\\n\\n\r\nSound:9/10\\n\r\nThe OST was superb with tracks like 'To Give a Marionette Life'' and ''Hyori Ittai'' really adding a lot of emotional depth to the scenes ..the music was one of the best I've heard in recent years(bettered only by Attack on Titan)..So it gets a 10/10 from me\\n\\n\r\nThe Voice acting for the four main actors was very good..But what really surpirsed me was that some of the best voice acting performances came from the side characters like Knov during his breakdown..There were no voices that seemed out of character and i found the voice acting in total to be very good..So it gets a 9/10 from me\\n\\n\r\nOverall Sound gets a 9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe large number of episodes certainly helped in building character depth to the characters...And by that i mean not just the main characters...Plenty of side characters like Shoot,Razor,Knov,Pouf,Bisky etc got important  minutes which made it easier to understand their motivations and their subsequent reactions to various situations..In fact I'd go so far as to say the characters and  the build up given to them is probably the best I've seen in anime...A definite 10/10 from me\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyed:From start to finish i enjoyed every second of it..A 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:HxH is quite simply one of the best animes I've seen..I decided to watch even though i had some doubts about its quality..But it completely blew me away and i look back on it as time well spent..A truly great anime and a must watch for every anime fan.",

            "content": "Hunter x Hunter 2011 is no ordinary Shounen by any stretch. It's one with very few Shounen tropes or cliches, one that is both refreshing, dark, as well as deep. It's essentially a Sienen disguised as a Shounen. Do not let the childish look or the fairly mediocre plot description turn you away from this anime, because it really does deceive you. You do not want to miss this masterpiece, it's something every veteran or newbie anime fan should watch at some point.\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nWhat really separates Hunter x Hunter from other Shounen is the fact that every arc is completely unique and different in almostevery way. They also flow right into each other naturally despite being so different. The writing of Hunter x Hunter is consistently brilliant with very few flaws and tends to be very intelligent, making the viewer question things as if this were a physiological anime. Hunter x Hunter also has the two best anime arcs of all time as far as I am concerned. Those who have seen it know which arcs I mean.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThe art style is fantastic but obviously gives off an initial childish look, the animation is excellent. You will notice some episodes are given much more attention in the art and animation department but even those that get less attention, they are still fantastic, and when you get to one of those episodes where more attention is given to the art and animation you will definitely be impressed. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nThe soundtrack starts off well but gets much much better over the course of the series and has some absolutely superb OST's. Hunter x Hunter 2011's soundtrack is definitely my favorite soundtrack of any anime and I've seen hundreds of anime so that's quite a feat.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\r\nAlong with the story, the characters are the two best components of Hunter x Hunter. There is a HUGE cast of very rich and extremely well developed characters, none of whom are copies of each other and are very unique and have their own attributes, interests and traits about them. The main characters, Gon, Killua, Leorio, and Kurapika all develop a huge amount over the course of the series which was an absolute trill to see how each of them developed. The villains are also all very deep for the most part, apart from one who isn't bad by any means but just not on the level of the others. Let me just say that Hunter x Hunter has some of the best villains of any anime.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI never once felt bored or tired of watching and was able to go on some seriously long binge watching sessions before I caught up at the time episode 137 was airing. From that point on every Tuesday was like a birthday with Hunter x Hunter as my present. An absolute joy to watch from beginning to end. It does start off a little slow in the first two episodes, but from then on it picks up the pace and only gets better and better.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nHunter x Hunter 2011 is the absolute king of Shounen anime, there is nothing better, and is my favorite anime of all time. This is one anime you can't miss. After reading this review you should be opening a new tab and watching it straight away because THIS is a masterpiece.\\n",

            "content": "I'm not a big fan of anime that are 24 episodes or longer as I feel at some point, it will become repetitive, but HxH is one of many exceptions. Every episode left me more interested than before, which is pretty hard for an anime with over 100 episodes. \r\nPlot: 10\r\nThe premise may not sound entirely enticing, but what you have to realize is that the quest to find his father is simply the basis of a magnificent adventure. This journey is filled with twists and turns with each being more surprising than the last. \r\nEarly on, the show already gets pretty dark, so donot let people tell you this show is for children. There is a sufficient amount of comedy though to level out the tone. We also have fights of epic proportions. Fights that will send shivers down your spine. I'd say a good portion of the fights are one-sided slaughters that will either make you say,\"Get rekt!\" or \"Man, I liked that guy.\" \\n\\n\r\nBelieve it or not, but this show knows how to deliver feels. They know exactly what kind of situations will mess with your heart. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the greatest things about the plot is the lack of filler. For more than 100 episodes, you get development after development after development. Even the few episodes that totally felt like filler had a role in the plot too. Those pseudo-fillers were created to gradually fill up the suspense and tension then have the next episode go full throttle in development. If a show can utilize fillers to their maximum potential, then you know it's going to be one hell of a show.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, the show is a non-stop train of anger, joy, curiosity, pity, sadness, & thrill.  \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\\n\r\nAs stated before, one of the biggest reasons as to why people often refuse to watch this show is because they are told it is childish. This belief comes from none other than the art. One look at the main protagonist and they think they're going to be watching some show from 4kids. \\n\\n\r\nTheir loss because besides the MC's ridiculously big eyes and a few other things, everything else is superb. The protagonist may not be to your taste, but I'm sure you will find at least one character who will be. Every single character looks neat and different from one another. The expressions are also spot on. \\n\\n\r\nThe amazing art isn't only limited to the characters. The fight scenes are visually glorious. The animations of the people's powers are just so nice to look at. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nI don't even know where to start with the sound. From the 1st episode to the last, the OP had the same lyrics and beat yet I enjoyed listening to it every time. Not only was the OP that great, what was shown in the OP changed depending on the arc. With their amazing art, they were able to make it seem like they completely changed the op every single arc, but in reality, it was still the same lovable opening.The same goes for the ED. It may seem different, but it's still the same beautiful music we always hear at the end. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the rest of the show's sounds, the music during certain events are brilliant. The music blends in perfectly with what's going on. Something scary may be happening and bam super ominous music. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nThe cast of Hunter x Hunter is god-send. Out of all the characters, there is probably only one character, you're bound to hate. The show is filled with an abundance of villains, but I guarantee you, you will come to love most of them. \\n\\n\r\nThe first character we are introduced to is Gon Freecs, he's your typical head-strong, rash, but kind shounen protagonist who has the will power to do things most aren't capable of. He may come off as annoying sometimes, but he's a competent protagonist. You can't hate him considering what he goes through. Also he is fairly young, so his actions shouldn't warrant complete criticism. \\n\\n\r\nNext, we have the deuteragonist, Killua Zoldyck. Personally, I like him more than Gon, but that's just me. For one thing, he has a really interesting background, and as you get to know more and more about it, you realize how well-written Killua is. Despite his dark past, he manages to live life to the fullest. On the outside, he appears to be cruel, but that's just how he was raised. Deep down, he's a caring boy, who just wants someone to pull him out of the abyss and guide him towards light. Not to mention, his cruel side mostly only surfaces when those he holds dear are in a predicament. Killua really is just a young boy with a dark past who wants nothing more than to live a happy life with those he cares for. \\n\\n\r\nThen, there's Kurapika & Leorio. They tend to be treated as the 3rd and 4th protagonist of the show, but they aren't present in a few arcs. Anyways, Kurapika is the type of person who you shouldn't judge by their cover. I mean I thought Kurapika was a girl for a good amount of time. In the group, Kurapika is the voice of reason, he tells them about the consequences of relying too much on emotion. Thing is, that reasoning disappears within the snap of a finger when his past is involved. He tries to remain calm, but if pushed further and further into the corner, he will become someone absolutely hellbent on revenge. Luckily, we have someone to balance out the atmosphere of the group, Leorio. He's somewhat of the comic relief guy. Being relatively old compared to the rest of the group, it's not very surprising that he's used for comedy. From time to time, he has his moments of wisdom as well as total bad-assery. \\n\\n\r\nLast but not least, we got the rest of the cast, all of them are unique and likable in their own way. Take Hisoka for example, a guy you see a lot throughout the series. Mysterious and sadistic, you just can't help, but love him. If you were to know him in real life, you'd probably avoid him at all costs, and that's what makes him so well received. His character is usually the one you hate in a show, but it's the opposite with Hisoka. You spend \\n\r\nquite the amount of time anxiously anticipating for Hisoka's next action because you just want to know what else he has left in store or up his sleeve.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\\n\r\nThe reason I gave every section a 10 is because Hunter x Hunter truly is a masterpiece. It's dark, funny, sad, & action-packed all at the same time. \\n\r\nThrow in the fact that 99% of the characters are well-written and you got yourself an adventure beyond your wildest dreams.",

            "content": "What\u2019s so special about Hunter X Hunter?\r\nA glance at any title from MyAnimeList\u2019s Top 7 Highest Rated (excluding Kimi no na Wa) will tell you why it holds a position there. The Gintama franchise combines an array of genres in its wacky, high-octane futuristic tale of wandering samurai. Steins Gate explores the nuances of the idea of time travel with an eccentric, otaku-oriented sense of humor. Legend of the Galactic Heroes presents a years-long struggle for the stars with style, grace, and intellectual brilliance. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood criticizes mankind\u2019s self-centered grasps for power with unflinching honesty. Then, there\u2019s Hunter X Hunter. From the synopsis, HxHis marketed as a superpowered shonen of great length (it\u2019s a whopping 148 episodes long!) that values friendship and following your dreams more than anything else. Compared to the other entries in MAL\u2019s Top Seven (again, excluding Kimi no na Wa), I wouldn\u2019t blame you if you feel indifferent towards HxH\u2019s first impression.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the most overused saying is \u201clooks can be deceiving\u201d but it\u2019s nearly-impossible to not be tricked by the show\u2019s Hunter Exam Arc. It begins with Gon Freecss, a happy-go-luck 12 year old island boy, leaving home to follow in the footsteps of his father Ging, who wears the title of \u201cAnime\u2019s Ultimate Deadbeat Dad\u201d like a badge of honor, and become a Hunter, which is basically another word for \u201cadventurous explorer\u201d. Befriending strangers (and enemies), learning new things, and having fun are the Hunter Exam Arc\u2019s raison d\u2019\u00eatre. Like a true stereotypical shonen, this arc glosses over the harsh realities of the Exam with a passion, choosing to portray it as the premier competitive sport instead of the merciless bloodbath that it really is. It is only when Gon is pushed to the brink of death in a fight against an examinee named Hanzo that the Hunter Exam Arc\u2019s underlying sobriety surges to the forefront.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the Hunter Exam Arc\u2019s shortcomings as a story, the animation is a marvelous spectacle to behold, thanks to HxH being produced by the great Madhouse. Although this series doesn\u2019t offer much in visual creativity, the various tints and shades used in each scene deserves recognition and you can really see Madhouse flexing its muscles with its scenery porn. It\u2019s because of the studio\u2019s spectacular backgrounds that HxH\u2019s diverse settings have a life of their own, from the beautiful yet low-key and withdrawn country of NGL to the mystifying nightlife allure of Yorknew City, and even the angelic homeliness of Whale Island. It doesn\u2019t hurt that mangaka Yoshishiro Togashi has a specialty for world-building; you can tell that he genuinely cares about the environments he creates when he dedicates entire episodes to the traditions and subtle nuances of the setting.\\n\\n\r\nHunter X Hunter\u2019s theme song \u201cDeparture\u201d, considered by even diehard HxH fans as hit or miss, is among the reasons why I trekked through the first arc with disappointment. At first, the only thing I thought Departure was worthy of was the skip button but over time it grew on me. I could say the same for HxH\u2019s soundtrack. Save for a few character themes (Hisoka\u2019s, Leorio\u2019s, and especially the Zoldyck Family\u2019s), most of the songs early on are hardly worth mentioning; they\u2019re grandiose and overpowering but collectively fail to deliver a lasting impact. It is later in the series that a multitude of unforgettable tracks make their dramatic entrance, from the rage-consumed \u201cChain Bastard\u201d to the stage-setting \u201cLegend of the Martial Artist\u201d, and of course the operatic glory that is \u201cRiot\u201d. What really elevates Hunter X Hunter into the upper echelon of musical experiences is its collection of ending themes. Most people laud the fifth ED, Yuzu\u2019s \u201cHyouriitai\u201d, as the best of the bunch due to its expertise in pulling heartstrings but my personal favorite is \u201cHunting for Your Dream\u201d. That ED basically personifies intensity.\\n\\n\r\nMore than anything else, Togashi\u2019s greatest skill has to be how he expands a simple shonen premise to include the full range of genres. Hunter X Hunter isn\u2019t just your run-of-the-mill action adventure; it dives into the world of RPGs with gusto, it features a pulse-pounding gangster noir thriller in the Phantom Troupe Arc, its final arc is geared entirely towards politics (Name another shonen that does that), and one episode of the Greed Island Arc deploys practically every clich\u00e9 of the romantic genre in existence. Oh and then there\u2019s the apocalyptic sci-fi horror epic known as the Chimera Ant Arc.\\n\\n\r\nI consider myself a chill, easygoing guy; it requires a lot of effort to piss me off but for years the one thing that I couldn\u2019t tolerate were ants. They\u2019re commonly viewed in a positive light, as the ideal assembly line workers in an ecosystem thriving on individualism. I, however, have always seen ants as disgusting little monsters that steal whatever they want and attack anyone that\u2019s not one of them. It all started at my daycare during my years as an elementary schooler. My friends and I were tired of being harassed by fire ants every time we played in the sand on our playground. With uncharacteristic fervor, I gathered up my friends and a few other kids that also hated the ants, and we marched up the hill of the playground with sharp sticks in our hands. At the top of the hill, the ants were secured in their headquarters, a misshapen mound as tall as my leg that they built from dirt, and we smashed it to pieces with our sticks, fists, and sneakers. Needless to say, the ants weren\u2019t too pleased with our remodeling and they attacked us without mercy. That incident was the catalyst for my hatred against those tiny insects. Whenever an ant somehow found its way into my house, I\u2019d pursue it like a madman and spray it to death with pesticide. Whenever I saw an ant in public, I\u2019d wildly stomp on it until I was absolutely sure it died. In my family, I was the unofficial ant exterminator.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the start, you can imagine how I felt towards the Chimera Ants, the most dangerous species in the HxH universe. \u201cKill them all!\u201d I shouted as the series ventured into new territory, with an arc centered on my greatest nemesis. The Chimera Ant Arc, more than any other arc, appealed to me on a personal level; the Hunters\u2019 quest to destroy the Ants was something I could relate to. It\u2019s also an intriguing arc due to it defining everything the series has been about up to this point; the Chimera Ant Arc ponders over the sacrifices a Hunter must take and ultimately what it means to be human. This arc does this while infusing a level of disturbing darkness that\u2019s unprecedented for a shonen. Some are most likely arguing that Hunter x Hunter has always been dark, especially with the massacre scene in the Phantom Troupe Arc, but nothing in this series even comes close to an Ant gruesomely murdering a beloved background character before devouring the dead body. Nothing comes close to another Ant gleefully watching an elderly man, naked and chained, begging for his life before the Ant squashes the poor guy beneath his hoof (When did HxH become Requiem from the Darkness?). The insert track \u201cNew Mutation\u201d is the perfect theme song for the Chimera Ant Arc; it\u2019s a somber, stage-setting melody that emphasizes the mysterious bleakness of it all. What I appreciate most about the Chimera Ant Arc is its brilliance as a character study.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to characterization in a shonen, the most effort that\u2019s normally applied is the main character dealing with dead parents and the supporting cast aiding the protagonist in his (it\u2019s always a guy) adventure. What originality! What complexity! What realism! Unlike your run-of-the-mill shonen mangakas, Togashi treats the characters he creates as real people. He doesn\u2019t murder them at random nor does he escort them to the background, unless it\u2019s Kurapika after he stole the show in the Phantom Troupe Arc or if it\u2019s one of the show\u2019s few female characters (The lack of respect for women in HxH is astonishing. I\u2019m surprised that this show passed the Bechdel Test). The best part about this show\u2019s cast isn\u2019t how truly dynamic the protagonists are (The changes that Gon and Killua undergo throughout the series are a blessing to behold) nor is it how memorable the antagonists are, save for Chrollo, from Meruem (the thinking man\u2019s villain) to Ilumi (a true master of manipulation) and of course Hisoka (the Joker of anime, he puts the \u201cC\u201d in crazy). No, the greatest thing about this show\u2019s characterization is how the transforms the guys that have no right to warrant speaking roles into complex, realistic figures. Tonpa is the self-proclaimed \u201cRookie Crusher\u201d of the Hunter Exam; on the surface, every action this man takes in the first arc is one of spineless self-preservation. However, we\u2019re shown through his internal monologues that he strategizes through his every more and that these actions are ones that Tonpa knows will benefit him on his quest to destroy the hopes and dreams of other Examinees. Binolt is a wanted criminal that sparred with Gon and Killua for one episode in the Greed Island Arc, his only appearance in the entire series. Through a memorably poignant backstory we witness the murderer\u2019s reason for becoming a criminal and what he thinks of his life up to this point. We see his shortcomings, both morally and as a fighter, and in the end we see how Binolt is inspired by Gon to become a better person. The best of the background characters, however, has to be Welfin. He\u2019s a Squadron Leader of the Chimera Ant army, a wolf-like being notorious for his constant paranoia. Welfin wishes to become the \u201cShadow King\u201d of the Ants, which is basically what Dick Cheney was during George W Bush\u2019s presidency, and his every action is designed to help him reach that goal. Later on, he establishes a friendship with Ikalgo, a traitorous Ant, and he starts to abandon his paranoia. Whether or not Welfin has ceased dreaming of being the \u201cShadow King\u201d is yet to be determined.\\n\\n\r\nThe majority of the Chimera Ant Arc has been focused on what demonic menaces the Ants are but in one scene during the arc\u2019s last episodes, the show reveals an even greater evil: us. The opening scene of episode 134 exposes the sinister, corrupt sides of ourselves for the whole world to witness in disgust. Through an old film reel effect, our blatant bigotry, our superiority complex, our sickening sadism and our overwhelming greed bleeds profusely from each heartbreaking frame. \u201cKingdom of Predators\u201d, one of HxH\u2019s finest insert tracks, plays throughout the scene, increasing in crescendo while patiently unveiling why its song title is fitting. When this scene ran its course, I finally discovered the darkness within myself. I realized that my grudge against ants was established an irrational hatred that began years and years ago. Thanks to Hunter X Hunter\u2019s Kingdom of Predators scene, my interactions with ants have changed. Whereas I used to murder them on sight, I now either ignore them or, if they\u2019re crawling around in my house, I place them in a napkin and escort them out of the house.\\n\\n\r\nEmotional appeal isn\u2019t something that\u2019s mentioned too often when it involves the shonen genre but in HxH, it\u2019s impossible for some events in the story to not pull your heartstrings. In my years watching anime, I admit there have been occasions where my eyes watered but no anime series had caused me to sob uncontrollably. Along came HxH\u2019s episode 124. When Killua confesses to Palm about how worthless he feels in helping Gon in his internal struggle, I sensed tears rolling down the sides of my face. To force a grown man that hadn\u2019t cried in years to break down in tears is simply incredible. To have that same man cry a second time 12 episodes later in the same show is nothing short of a miracle. It\u2019s in episode 136, when a village girl named Reina is reunited with her mom, and they\u2019re both sobbing over how weak and fragile they are. The 2011 adaptation of Hunter X Hunter isn\u2019t the \u201cperfect\u201d series per se but trust me when I say that there will be thousands of Dragon Ball Z rip-offs before we witness another show like this one. HxH is primarily a thinking man\u2019s anime but is more than able to pull off amazing battle sequences when necessary. It expands its horizons to include many genres and ideas but is equally brilliant at priotizing one. Above all else, what other series could be a better fighting game than this one? 148 phenomenal episodes and Hunter X Hunter is still radiating with potential to this day. Now, that\u2019s something special if you ask me.\\n",

            "content": "As one of the top rated animes surrounded by love and hype, I came into this anime expecting it to exceed many of it\u2019s general shounen counterparts.  Although I\u2019ve always enjoyed a good shounen, there are many tropes that often come up that drive me nuts from clich\u00e9 drives to generically get stronger to drawn out battle sequences to power escalation issues.  Many in the genre are marred with these problems, but from what I\u2019ve heard around the hype of Hunter x Hunter, I thought I might get a fun battle oriented anime that escapes these problems.  Then I watched Hunter xHunter.  \\n\r\nMy first thought: is this an elaborate prank?\\n\r\nNot only does Hunter x Hunter fall into these tropes at various points in the show, Hunter x Hunter finds a new way to drive its viewer insane each episode from a drawn out overhyped dodgeball game to an insane and utterly absurd power surge in the main character for a side character we hardly get enough time to know and care about to main characters with such forgettable backgrounds that the show literally forgets about their existence for half the series.  At the end I was left confused by how anyone could watch this incoherent mess that felt like sitting through an 11 year old\u2019s DnD campaign.\\n\r\nThe story follows through five main archs and two sub archs. In the beginning, I wasn\u2019t actually upset too much about the show.  The first arch is a cute generic examination arch where are four protagonists are fighting for their hunter\u2019s license.  Although there is nothing strikingly novel and unique about this arch, the story is enjoyable enough to follow through and there are a handful of moments truly entertaining that keep you hooked. \\n\r\nOne of my early issues for the show does pop up in the early episodes in the character designs.  Individually each character looks fine.  However as the characters line up, I find it painfully hard to see how they all belong in the same anime.  Not only are there designs wildly different, but even the stylization of how they are drawn doesn\u2019t seem to match. I could go on for hours about the problematic character lineup that appears in this show, but this isn\u2019t a character design review so I\u2019ll keep it brief. Some have different stylized line weights to their outlines while others follow vastly different color pallets.  Characters look like they\u2019re plucked from all different animes/mangas from Jo Jo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure to Cowboy Bebop.  This problem becomes much stronger as you follow through the show and more outrageous character designs occur, especially in the final arch with the zodiacs.  Although with that said, I do have to give it to the anime/manga,the designs are unique.  Not in a good way, but they are unique.\\n\r\nThe second sub story archs allow our main characters to grow stronger (falling into the power up shounen trop) and allow us to learn more about one of the main character\u2019s (and probably my favorite character, Killua) background story.  Here is one of the brighter spots in the anime as we find the show for the first time truly take a shot at world building around the Zoldyck family rather than follow the vague mess of a world they had before.  In the arena arch we are finally introduced to the magic system of the show which is awkwardly thrown in and never even referred to in the first several episodes of the anime.  The magic system of Hunter x Hunter is not unique or anything special, but it functions (somewhat) for the anime and fills its role well enough.\\n\r\nThe second large plot revolves around another main character, Kurapika.  Again this plot is fairly generic telling of a revenge arch, but it\u2019s interesting enough and the use of the magic system in this plot is actually interesting and somewhat novel.  The ending of this plot, however, is the start of this shows downfall from generic and bland Shonen to unbearably bad disaster.\\n\r\nThe next two main archs are bad for different reasons.  The first of these is the Greed Island arch where are mains leave the large city of Yorknew City (Yes, I know how wonderful their worldbuilding names are \ud83d\ude43).  We get a new system separate from the main magic system of insane cards where I feel like I was slapped into a Yu Gi Oh knockoff (as if the original anime wasn\u2019t bad enough).  The plot quickly becomes so contrived and the new magic system is so complicated and useless to the rest of the anime that I almost dropped the anime here.  But I didn\u2019t and I suffered through the epic battle that this arch leads you two.  The epic, multiple episode long dramatic life and death game of... dodgeball... I\u2019m not sure I need to say much more here.  \\n\r\nAfter that we get into a several episodes setting up our next story arch that might have been my favorite large arch.  Although the premise of this arch is a bit far fetched, it\u2019s over all concept is interesting and engaging and its execution was surprisingly well crafted and conveyed in comparison to the rest of the anime.  Of course by now we have already lost two of our main characters forgotten back in Yorknew City and are flooded with another set of strange and incoherent character designs.  However, despite this I actually could get on board with this arch.  Well until it\u2019s ending where we literally spent multiple episodes just for 10 seconds of the epic battle.  This arch ends in the worst example of a drawn out shounen battle I\u2019ve ever seen before.  I\u2019d take the ridiculously long battles of Bleach over this arch\u2019s epic battle.  Not to mention our lovely little Gon goes from short shorts to booty shorts in his ridiculously contrived power up over the death of a sub character he had only met twice in his life.  This sweet cinnamon roll of a character does such a strong 180 in just a few episodes that it almost seems unbelievable and ruins all attempts to make his power up scene emotional.  With that said, however, the best moment of this entire anime occurs at the end of the battle in a heavily emotionally charged scene between the Ant King, Meruem, and Komugi.\\n\r\nFinally we move to the final and hardest story arch to get through as we finally get a proper definition of a hunter outside of a generic action adventure hero who can travel anywhere he wants.  This isn\u2019t a good thing though as the majority of the plot is the most dull and obnoxious display of never ending bureaucracy.  There is an interesting subplot going on between Killua and his family, but honestly I regret wasting my time actually watching this plot.  Even at the end when we have a \u2018happy moment\u2019 when Gon finally accomplishes is major goal, I just feel bitter and I\u2019m sorry, but I hate Gon\u2019s dad. \\n\r\nIn the end this anime is mediocre at it\u2019s point and almost entirely unwatchable at its worst.  It\u2019s hard for me to justify giving it anything above a 4. The one thing pulling me through the horrendous plots and unbearably uncomfortable Hisouka moments is the dynamics of Gon and Killua\u2019s relationship.  Their friendship is surrounded by cute interactions and the two characters play off each other really well, although it\u2019s hard to deny the romantic underpinnings behind Killua\u2019s crush for Gon. It is my favorite part of this otherwise awful anime. \\n\r\nMy final thoughts are this anime might be alright to have playing in the background from time to time and does have some genuinely enjoyable moments, but overall it is not worth wasting the hours to.  But of course this is my own opinion.  If you enjoy it, go ahead and continue to watch the anime. Sadly this anime is not one for me.",

            "content": "Hunter x Hunter is the most overrated anime series I've ever watched. I've never seen a fanbase more toxic and elitist than Hunter x Hunter fans. All of these people just constantly praise this anime and talk about how well written it is, but in reality that isn't true. In reality this is just another garbage battle shounen series like the rest of them. It isn't complex, it isn't well written at all, it's nothing but complete and utter dog shit.\r\nHunter x Hunter is about a kid named Gon Freecs that becomes a Hunter and wants to find his dad someday. This is the worststory I've ever seen in a Shounen anime. I'll be explaining why I say this later on in this review\\n\\n\r\nHunter x Hunter has one thing going for it, the Yorknew Arc. Every other arc in this show was complete and utter garbage and I'll explain why. First we have the Hunter Exam arc. This was just a pathetic version of the Chunin Exams. It just feels way too slow and boring. This was the first arc in the series and it just failed to get me attached to any of the characters. There was just no reason to like any of these characters at all. Gon was the typical generic shounen protagonist. Killua was the typical edgy kid. Kurapika was the cliche revenge character. The only character that was interesting was Leorio. All of the trials in this arc were boring to watch and that's pretty much it. The mini tournament was also uninteresting/boring\\n\\n\r\nNext we have the Zoldyck Family arc. Ahh what a waste of time. I actually thought something big would happen in this arc, but this unfortunately wasn't the case. They just go into the mansion and then get Killua and then leave. This arc should've been longer and actually gave more depth to Killua's family, but it didn't! In the end I didn't give a single shit about his family and any other character involved in this arc. And as usual, we get that stupid friendship/nakama bullshit in this arc. This is why I say that Hunter x Hunter is nothing different from the typical shounen, because it still has that nakama bullshit.\\n\\n\r\nHeaven's Arena was just so boring it nearly made me fall asleep multiple times. Togashi actually made an interesting concept for an arc, but then completely ruins it. He ruins it by making the whole arc a damn training arc. This just doesn't make sense to me. This arc was way too focused on training instead of the actual fucking Heavens Arena. This is one of my biggest problems with Hunter x Hunter in general. This series just has way too much training and less story to it. None of the villains were interesting at all. They were just the typical cliche villains you'd see in any Shounen. The fights were complete and utter garbage. It's funny how they spend so much time training yet when Gon finally fights Hisoka it's nothing but hand to hand combat for the most part. So much training yet he doesn't even know how to use real techniques. Infact he doesn't even know how to use real techniques until like fucking 60 episodes!\\n\\n\r\nNext is the Yorknew arc. a very good arc. Almost everything about this arc was actually phenomenal, but there are some problems. Firstly, the main two characters are so fucking annoying I just couldn't stand it. Uvogin was a very generic character and just not interesting to me. The rest of the phantom troupe all lacked any depth to them so I just didn't find them to be good villains. The best thing about this arc was Kurapika and his character development. Kurapika is the only character in Hunter x Hunter with good development. The rest of the main characters are complete and utter garbage with no redeeming qualities. Also the fight between Uvogin and Kurapika was pretty cool. \\n\\n\r\nGreed Island is one of the most pointless and boring arcs I've seen in a Shounen. Once again this arc is filled with boring training that nobody gives a shit about. Togashi made an interesting concept for an arc just to ruin it by making it a training arc. He just doesn't know how to balance things out and this arc is the perfect example. Them collecting cards was painfully boring to watch. The card system wasn't explained in detail so that was boring. We don't know what any of these cards are or do, so I got bored with all the card collecting bullshit. The main villain has got to be the one of the worst villains I've seen in a Shounen series. No depth whatsoever. He's just the typical one dimensional villain that's evil just for the sake of being evil. See it's funny how Hunter x Hunter fans talk about how well written this anime is, but I just don't see it! Characters like Genthru clearly contradict that statmement, and there's no debating about this. The fights in this arc were really bad. Gon vs Genthru was filled with plot armor it was just laughable. He should've easily lost that fight, but he just wins because of 100% plot armor. Greed Island could've been a good arc but it was ruined by many things. Bad villains, boring training, and barely any explanation to the card system. The world of Greed Island had 0 detail, none whatsoever. This just feels like a filler arc overall. One of the worst arcs in Shounen.\\n\\n\r\nThe Chimera Ant arc has got to be the most overrated Shounen arc I've ever seen. This is the most boring arc I've ever watched in an anime. The first 20 episodes of it were extremely slow paced and dragged on WAY too long. There was just far too much underdeveloped characters getting screen time so it was just ridiculous. The narration was the worst part about this arc. It completely ruined this arc in many ways. Firstly, the narration happened in some of the most important parts in the arc. When they where raiding the palace I just completely lost interest because of the fucking narration. This man was narrating for almost the entire episode it was just ridiculous. The fact that there needs to be narration in order to have people understand what's happening is just stupid. Firstly, it's an insult to the viewers. It's like they think the viewers are too stupid to understand what's going on, so there needs to be narration all the time. That's the impression I'm getting from this. Secondly, there's a lot of Shounen out there that don't need narration to tell a good story. \\n\\n\r\nNow when it comes to fights, this arc had some of the most overrated fights I've ever seen. First we have Gon vs Neferpitou. Gon gets a random asspull powerup and beats the shit out of her. It was really fucking stupid to see Gon so mad about what happened to Kite anyways. He barely even fucking knew him yet he's crying like a bitch when he dies. This just made no sense whatsoever, and this was just bad writing at its finest. He only knew him for two weeks and he went ape shit when he found out what happened to him. This was just pathetic writing. Next overrated fight, Meruem vs Netero. Imagine hyping up a villain for 50 episodes just for him to have no cool techniques or anything. His fight with Netero was so boring. He just gets smacked away and flies right back at him. The only good thing about this fight was the animation. Everything else was complete and utter garbage as expected.\\n\\n\r\nIt's funny to me how this anime tried to have strategic battles in its early stages. Later on it just becames the typical battle shounen with power levels. Gon vs Hisoka and Gon vs Genthru had some strategy, but Meruem vs Netero was a terrible fight and was just about who has the higher power level. There's no good reason why Meruem is that strong either. He has no techniques or anything. That's why that fight was complete trash.\\n\\n\r\nNow lets talk about the battle system in Hunter x Hunter. The battle system is actually pretty good. Togashi puts so much detail into the battle system, but there is a problem here. The problem is that a shit ton of fights in which the battle system doesn't even fucking matter! Like why put so much detail into the power system when the fights just end up being the typical shounen fights! Meruem vs Netero is the perfect example of this. This fight was just another typical DBZ type of fight you see in anime. All I'm saying is, if you're going to spend so much time putting detail into the power system, at least make it important in every fight.\\n\\n\r\nRememeber how I said Hunter x Hunter had the worst story I've ever seen in a Shounen? I'll explain why I said that right now. Gons goal was finding his dad right? SPOILER: After the death of Netero, everyone Hunter has to attend the election. This is when Gon meets his dad....This is the most garbage thing I have ever seen. After all those arcs trying to find clues to know his dads whereabouts, this is how they meet. What was the point in Yorknew? What was the point in Greed Island? This was the most unsatisfying thing I've ever seen in an anime. After all that hard work, Gon ends up meeting Gnig in the stupidest fucking way possible.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking about the Election arc, this arc was complete trash. The only interesting thing about it was Leorio and what he said about Ging. Everything else was bad. Alluka was a terrible character. She was just a living plot device and that's all there was to this character. Nothing about this arc was good and that's all there is to it.\\n\\n\r\nNow lets talk about the characters. There's only one good character in Hunter x Hunter, and that would be Kurapika. He's the only character with interesting character development. Gons character development was complete trash, specifically talking about when (spoiler) kite died. THat was just awful development. Killua had some development, but I disliked him due to his constant change in personalities. One second he's the typical 12 year old, the next second he's edgy as hell. His character development is very basic aswell. Leorio could've been a good character, but unfortunately he was neglected for like 90% of the anime. It pisses me off how the only decent characters barely got any screen time at all. Meruem is incredibly overrated. He's just the typical \"I want to rule the world\" type of villain. His character development was very basic and nothing special at all. His development is pretty much him becoming more of a good guy due to Komugis influence. Oh wow, a villain that becomes a good guy... wow that's such great writing isn't it.... -_- I've seen character development like his in a lot of anime, so I don't get why people suck him off so hard. Overall, Hunter x Hunter has bad characters.\\n\\n\r\nHunter x Hunter has terrible art. Not only in the manga, but in the anime aswell. This anime has some of the most ugly character designs I've seen in a shounen. There's just way too many ugly looking characters it just looks so childish. There's nothing interesting about the music or animation either. The music was very unmemorable to me, and the animation isn't anything special.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime was horrible. The only enjoyable arc in this anime was the Yorknew arc and that's it. Everything else about this anime was boring and painful to watch. I don't recommend watching this anime. There's just so much other anime to watch that are much better. If you're looking for a badass shounen with awesome fights and great characters, go watch Yu Yu Hakusho. They were both written by the same mangaka, but at least Yu Yu Hakusho is enjoyable to watch. The Dark Tournament and Chapter Black arc are both better than anything I've seen in Hunter x Hunter.",

            "content": "-Summary-\r\nStory: 8\r\nArt: 10\r\nSound: 9\r\nCharacter: 10\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: 10\r\nThis show is everything I want in an anime. Stunning visuals, awesome/catchy soundtrack, great story, and some of the most likable and interesting characters to ever appear in anime. Please, Japan, make more shows like this one.\r\n-Details-\r\nStory: 8\r\nGenres: Action, Adventure, Shonen, Superpower\r\nThemes: Friendship, Aloof/Badass/Mysterious father, Coming-of-Age, Individualism (Natsume Soseki) vs serving the group first, Human nature, Good vs evil\r\nThe basic premise of this show is not too different than other shonen fighters. The main character, Gon Freecss, was abandoned by his father who wanted to pursue his own adventures as a hunter rather than raise a kid. Now Gon wantsto become a hunter in order to understand why being a hunter is apparently so great (that one would even abandon their kid) and also so that he can become strong enough to find his dad.\\n\r\nThus the story unfolds. Gon takes the hunter exam, gets stronger, and makes plenty of friends along the way. Standard shonen stuff. Now that I think about it, there isn't much more to the actual story than this. Every arc before the chimera ant arc is directly related to finding Gon's dad. The chimera ant arc is a bit of an aside, though it does take up about half the story at this point due to its length. So, as a story, it's pretty simple. I'd say the main reason why the story seems so good is because pretty much every other aspect of this anime is amazing, and so those aspects help turn a simple, somewhat unconventional, story into something truly worth remembering.\\n\r\nThere is no filler. However, the aforementioned chimera ant arc is rather long and is probably stretched a bit too much. Other than that, the pacing is very good.  After the chimera ant arc there is one more arc, and then the show basically stops without really ending.  Many people would probably find this frustrating.  It's possible that one day Madhouse will add another season or 2 of this show but that depends on the manga actually getting somewhere, which many people despairingly think will not happen for a while.  Thus, don't come into this show expecting complete resolution.  You get some of that since it stops between story arcs, but it's still clear the story isn't done.\\n\r\nThe most prominent story telling technique is the action earlier on, and later it becomes a combination of action and drama. The story starts out rather light-hearted with fun fights and such, but starting with the Greed Island arc the story starts to show where it's going. Darker themes begin to emerge with eviler villains, and more graphic violence is shown on-screen. One of the best parts of the show later on is the drama pulled from character development, intense fights, and some episodes which actually feature pretty decent philosophical discussions. One of the more apparent themes the show discusses is whether individualism or a group oriented disposition is more conducive to individual growth and group growth. So, it takes a little while before this becomes apparent, but this is definitely a show that both entertains with action but also gives you something to think about. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nStudio: Madhouse\\n\\n\r\nMadhouse does not fail to impress. Earlier on the art features bright, fun colors and is very clean. The animation is generally good and only becomes great during action scenes. But later on, in the chimera ant arc, Madhouse shifted into another gear and made the visuals really amazing and stylized. The source of the superpowers in this show, \"Nen,\" is the perfect excuse to start making scenes look really awesome. Nen is one's life force, which one can focus into a useful offensive or defensive force. Nen can manifest visually, thus when someone is angry their nen can look darker and more intimidating. Madhouse portrays this phenomenon by adding swirling black currents of whispy air/gas substances around a character, for example. This looks really cool during some of the more dramatic scenes and is the kind of stylization that can really only be done with anime. And personally, when I find an anime that makes use of the fact that it is an anime and does something only this medium can do, I love it.\\n\r\nAnother thing I like is the CG is used sparingly, and when it is used, you hardly notice it. It is mostly used for things like cars or planes, which I find is probably the best way to use CG in anime. All of the action sequences are done with beautiful, stylized traditional animation, and I love Madhouse for that. I've re-watched episodes just for the visuals.\\n\r\nVarious character designs are updated and improved from the 1999 version of the anime. Overall I'd say that the visuals are of this version are superior to the 1999 version in pretty much every way. The opening and ending themes all look great too, especially opening themes #5 and #6.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\\n\r\nI'm never very good at judging a soundtrack, but even I know this one is good. The opening and ending themes fit very, very well with this show. The biggest gripe I see with this though is that the opening theme is basically the same each season (only a few lines of lyrics are ever changed--basically, the opening theme doesn't ever change, though the visuals do). But this isn't much of a problem for me since I love the opening theme and it really does fit the show well. As far as I can tell, every track is great and fits with both the combat scenes and the down-time. Later on, there are some classical pieces added to the soundtrack, which are always awesome, and there are some darker tracks that really enhance the intense scenes you get later on in this show.  I can't sit here and describe them because spoilers.\\n\r\nSound effects and voice acting are also very good. One voice I especially love is Hisoka's.  His creepy, perverted, blood-knight personality is captured perfectly by the voice actor. Gon's adorable childishness but also his anger at various points in the story are also done very well. Really, I have no complaints. This simply is high quality stuff all-around.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all amazing. Hands down. Gon may seem to be another Goku clone--young, innocent, with prodigious fighting talent, but he really is his own unique character. The development he gets later on, especially in the chimera ant arc, is amazing and actually quite surprising. At this point in the show, he practically seems like a different person when compared with his initial appearance. Killua and his family of assassins are all very interesting. One of the things I liked the most early on was the friendship between Gon and Killua. They are actually shown doing things that two 12-year-old boys would do, like messing around, having pillow fights, running around and exploring islands and their surroundings, etc. The compatibility of their personalities and the strength of their friendship is something that is very touching at points, and I would go as far as to say that it is an ideal friendship. \\n\r\nAnother thing that is so great about this show is the sheer number of good, interesting characters with interesting character designs, as well as the complexity of their personalities. It is hard to say there are any straight-up good or evil characters--things aren't that simple in this universe. A character you start out hating, you might end up loving by the time their story is through, and vice-versa. The power system in this show is highly personalized and so it is always fun to see a new character's powers; there are still some that haven't been revealed, and guessing what they might be is also fun.\\n\r\nIf you like shows with a large, fun, and diverse cast of interesting characters with an aesthetically pleasing set of character designs, then look no further.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: 10\\n\\n\r\nThis show is just plain fun. It's fun to see the characters grow; it's fun to see them develop their powers and guess in what ways they will grow; it's fun to accompany Gon and Killua on their big adventure, etc., etc. It is hard to find faults with this show. The art is beautiful, the soundtrack is awesome and catchy, the characters are highly memorable, the story is solid and interesting. Only one arc--the chimera ant arc--could be said to be longer than it needs to be, but it is also the most well-written, interesting, and visually stunning story arc so far. I have already watched all of the episodes twice so far, and I already want to watch it all again. This show is a classic. \\n\r\nThe only reason I can think of why you might not like this show is simply if you don't like fun adventures for the sake of being fun. Note that this is not a criticism--everyone's tastes are different. I have a friend at school who tends to only like literature that is more academic in nature--stories by the likes of Dostoevsky and such. Sure, this show isn't a novel and it isn't going to appear in your literature class at university. But it doesn't need to. Chances are that if you watch anime, you don't care about a show's value as literature or a novel story in the first place. Very few do. I only bother to bring this up for the 0.01% of you who actually care about this, like my friend.\\n\r\nOne last point: I do believe that relative newbies to anime could enjoy this too. There is almost no fan-service and a relatively low amount of anime weirdness. If I had my way, I'd make everyone watch this.",

            "content": "If you ask me, there is and will never be an anime as good as Hunter X Hunter. No anime has ever accomplished what Hunter X Hunter has. And in my honest belief, there will be no anime that will ever do so. This anime knew what the viewers wanted, like as if the audience had decided what the anime should do next, except with a better twist, a thicker more fluid plot, a humorous laugh, epic fights, and an ultimate finish. This anime knew when to stop and when to keep going, when to be all about friendship and trust but at the sametime keep it toned down so that people could feel the true effects of comradery and being friends. They knew when to add epic fight scenes, and when to get serious upon being jokeful and laughing. This anime had kept things within limits, not too little so that you won't enjoy it, but not too much so that you feel as if you had had enough of it. It made you feel the ultimate impact of things, it didn't rely on simple tactics or surface reasonings to decide the outcome of this anime. All throughout the anime, it had not disappointed once. Every moment had been fun and enjoyable, with great quality and not a single drop of disappointment was spilled. It had a fluid story, one that didn't feel random and contrived, but one that flowed smoothly and made you feel as if you were watching one consecutive story. Not a jumbled mess of random occurrences, based on coincidences and, \"when I felt like it.\" I'm not going to play koi, I'm talking about Fairy Tail. The difference between these animes, at least the major ones that I had clearly noticed, are three things. One, Fairy Tail almost never stayed within reasonable boundaries, logic was thrown out, and this made fights become contrived and boring. Relying on the \"doing it for my friends,\" tactic, gaining their comrades immense amounts of power for almost no logical reason. Secondly, the comradery was too much, it simply became corny and annoying after a while. This made the audience rather bored with no effect intact, hunter x hunter knew when to stop, which helped the audience feel the full message, but at the same time, not getting so overwhelmed by it. And lastly, the random jumbled story that Fairy Tail has, the events and story archs simply came one after another. There was no logical flow to it. It had more felt like a multitude of plays rather than one consecutive show. Hunter X Hunter had a fluid story, it made you feel like everything that happened made sense. *Small Spoilers* The hunter x hunter exam begins, killua meets his brother, killua gets practically hypnotized and gon and his friends search for him, they save him, they need to get stronger so gon can punch hisoka in the face, they go to the tower of heavens. Even only going this far, there feels to be a continuous story, although I won't explain why Gon must punch Hisoka in the face... as I have probably already spilled too much, everything has a reason, nothing is coincidence. There are two last things I would love to point out before ending this review, it is that Hunter X Hunter, had made me feel more emotion than clannad, more hyped up adrenaline than Fairy Tail, more joyous and laughing moments than Beelzebub, and honestly, is the best anime to such date. Hunter X Hunter always stayed within reasonable boundaries, as said before, so jokes, action scenes, even the sad scenes, all seemed natural and flowed well. They didn't put the scenes there so it could make you cry, there was a reason these people were crying, it didn't go too far either so you could feel the affect of every moment. Even the jokes themselves, they managed to make me laugh to the point of not being able to breathe because I got the jokes, they played humor on what you might see in actual life. Its reasonable and logical, making you feel everything but without going too far. The second thing I would like to add, as said probably numerous amounts of times in here, is that Hunter X Hunter, is logical and reasonable. It doesn't rely on simple tactics to base the anime off of. No matter how many times you promise you're going to win, whether your friends die or not, you will not be able to beat an opponent whos stronger than you. This is something nearly ever shounen anime breaks logic of, cough cough FAIRY TAIL... If you're weaker than them, you train, you get stronger, and you fight them. If you won, it isn't because you gained tremendous power losing a friend, its because you worked hard at it. Hunter X Hunter understands this, and follows this, it feels like as if everything was staying in logical boundaries, and it made the anime more enjoyable overall. It made the action more enjoyable, it made the experiences more realistic, it made the moments stupendous. Even scenes that were sad, it was nothing like Clannad, that don't get me wrong, it was sad indeed, but it also went overboard. I could not feel the affect of the moment, only the tears because the scene knew how to be sad, but it felt almost forced, acted, somehow. In Hunter X Hunter, even though I had not cried I felt the affect of the moment. And that is what made me feel even more sad than Clannad itself. This anime had stayed great until the very end, not a single moment had I regretted it, and at the end it only got better. Everything was wrapped up, no misconceptions were left behind, and it left with an epic finish. There is no other thing to call this anime, a once in a literal life time anime, but a masterpiece.",

            "content": "I wont spend a lot of time going over the premise of Hunter x Hunter. The summary on MAL already covers what I could probably say about it (without spoiling much) Thus, I'm going to cut some corners a bit to talk about why I feel you should watch Hunter X Hunter.\r\nSo, I initially heard about Hunter x Hunter when I was looking for more works by Yoshihiro Togashi. I had just finished watching Yu Yu Hakusho (back when they showed it on Cartoon Network at 5 in the morning) and I loved that series so much that I wanted more of it. When Isaw Hunter X Hunter, I remember reading the synopsis, but at the time it just didn't seem that interesting. I thought to myself \"Well, I might check it out someday\"\\n\\n\r\nFast forward to over a decade later (from 2000ish to 2014). My friend and I decide we're going to try out various anime series. He brings up the idea of Hunter X Hunter. I figured, why the hell not? I was overdue for at least checking it out.We started watching the 2011 series, and in several weeks had already caught up to the most recent episode (We probably would've gotten there faster had we not exercised some restraint)\\n\\n\r\nYou probably already know by now it's a shounen show. The question with shounen shows is often \"What makes this stand out among other shounens?\" A question that's not usually asked about other types of shows because they're usually not 100s of episodes long.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of people, I've noticed, have said that Hunter x Hunter is dark. I don't like that word. It's used way too much. Any series can become \"dark\" simply from having a character die (or at least that's what it seems like) Dark is often used to describe when a light hearted show turns serious. I don't think it's specific enough to describe what makes HxH good.\\n\\n\r\nYoshihiro Togashi really shines, in my opinion, in his ability to create characters. Characters who aren't simply out to be good or evil but actually have complex motives. Characters with personalities that play well off of each other.\\n\\n\r\nInstead of dark, I'd consider Hunter x Hunter to be complex. Something that requires you to think about things. Rather than simply cheering for the heroes, you'll wind up thinking about other people. Hell, I've had moments where I didn't want an antagonist to lose or win (It's a complicated feeling, but it's a really neat one to have) Everything not being black and white.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing about Hunter x Hunter is it can be a little hard to predict due to this complexity. In a lot of shounen shows it's often about the protagonist getting stronger than the antagonist, the courage to continue fighting, the love of friends,etc. While those things do still exist in HxH, there's more dimensions to them. Friendship, for example doesn't just exist in the form of \"I believe in you\" but more of a \"I'll do anything to protect you\" The courage to never give up sometimes doesn't lead them to victory. Power while useful, doesn't trump someone who knows how to use his abilities to gain advantages. With things like that always being thrown into the mix, it's often hard to predict where it goes. \\n\\n\r\nOne last thing I like is the pacing. While there can be some parts that drag on, in my opinion, it still remains interesting. They never spend more than they need to on something.\\n\\n\r\nNow for some down sides:\\n\\n\r\nThe first isn't really a big deal, but it disappointed me a bit. The opening song alternates between two versions of the same song. It has done this for 5-6 different openings. While I've grown to really like the song (since it makes me think of HxH) part of what really pumps me up for new arcs in shounen shows tend to be the new song openings.\\n\\n\r\nThe other downside I can think of is that sometimes I become so interested in a character that I become annoyed when their path separates from the main character's.Of course this usually ends up being good when(if) they end up showing up again later in the story. However, I always get nervous that they wont keep up with all the characters they introduce.\\n\\n\r\nI previously wrote this review when HxH was around episode 130 something. If you're wondering if my opinion has changed since it has ended, no. I still think it's a great anime adaptation and worth seeing if you're in need of a good character driven series. \\n\\n\r\nIn regards to the series ending before the manga, it was inevitable, but I think they did a good job of both resolving things and keeping it open ended. Should they ever decide to do a continuation of the anime in the future (which I hope they do) I think there's plenty of room for it (unlike some shows that go ahead and make up endings that make it harder for the anime to ever be picked up again)",

The opening and closing credits also contain excellent songs and imagery that change to match the tone of each arc.\\n\\n\r\nThe intro's and outro's, rather than being a jumble of random scenes like most shows, give subtle hints as to how the story will unfold.  Only as you progress will you be able to appreciate how much thought and intelligence went into making them.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes the show truly great though are it's three core tenants; smarts, surprise and variety.\\n\\n\r\nIt is cunning and cleverness that often define the victor in this world and right up to the final episode the show was still subverting my expectations with how much wit it had to display.\\n\\n\r\nNone of the above would mean anything of course unless you have a great cast of characters to take advantage of, and boy oh boy, Hunter x Hunter has enough of those to fill a dozen epic sized anime's to bursting.\\n\\n\r\nThere's so much more detailed praise I'd like to give but I wont because you need to savour all the surprises and excitement for yourself first-hand if you decide to watch it, which I really, really recommend you do.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like anime, great stories, or superbly crafted entertainment you simply must watch Hunter x Hunter.

            "content": "This guide will contain NO spoilers, and I would say this is one of the safer reads for someone still asking themselves \"Should I watch this?\"\r\nPior to watching Hunter x Hunter, Shonen genre held a stigma for me. Anything that took 100+ episodes to tell a story was either not telling a story very well, or not telling a very good story. This assumption still holds true for many of the genre, in my opinion. Fairy Tail, Naruto, and Bleach, all series that hold a large fanbase, with many, many dedicated fans that love the genre. Not HXH. \r\nHunter x Hunter has the unique qualityof running a full 148 episodes, telling a very good story, and never pulling punches. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: As said before, I'll keep the spoilers brief.\\n\r\nGon is a 12 year old boy who wants to be a Hunter. Someone who goes around the world 'Hunting' for something. Gon hunts for his father, someone whom left him at an early age to become a Hunter himself. Wondering how any man could abandon his child, Gon searches to find his Dad, and to experience the wonders of the world that must have driven him away from his child.\\n\\n\r\nAs such, he partakes in the Hunter Exams, a brutal and deadly test that culls the weak and rains hell on anyone unprepared. The survivors are granted a Hunter License, which allows them funding, and access to restricted areas for their adventures.\\n\\n\r\nThere, he meets Leorio, a man whom only wants to get money from the Hunter Exams\\n\r\nKirapika, a mysterious young boy whom refuses to speak of his reasons,\\n\r\nKillua, a boy raised from a family of assassins whom befriends Gon,\\n\r\nAnd Hisoka, an extremely unnerving clown looking fellow who is as mysterious as he is powerful.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY:\\n\r\nCharacters aside, the most interesting thing about the story aside from those that partake in it, is the tropes. Or the lack of, more accurately. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters are weak. Power-ups aren't easy. Sacrifices are made. Not everyone comes out in one piece when facing someone that is clearly stronger. \\n\\n\r\nI wont talk about the story as much as other reviews, as I want this to be an entirely spoiler free review that doesn't reveal anything from beyond the first arc. \\n\\n\r\nGon's quests to find his Dad isn't as simple as it seems, and it becomes clear that his father expected him to take the Hunter exam. As such, various barriers are put before him before he can even get on the right track for finding his Dad. \\n\\n\r\nEven more troublesome, Gons friends are often in need of help themselves. Despite this sounding like a round-a-bout plot, the story never loses focus. You will always feel that things are happening for a reason. Moving from point A to point B, with the story moving forward as the characters do. There are no filler arcs, there are no episodes where you feel that nothing important or moving has happened.\\n\\n\r\nThis makes Hunter x Hunter much more exciting a watch than other Shonen anime, where many of the arcs seem to be insignificant to the overall plot.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nOkay, let me be honest. Two OPs for a 148 series gets boring after a while. Other than a OP that gets old after a while, the ending pieces are godly, and the tracks for scenes always brings a fitting atmosphere to the table. There may have been some scenes where the music choice was off? I don't personally remember any. \\n\\n\r\nSound effects wise, there's nothing spectacular. They serve their purpose, and do so well enough that they don't detract from the enjoyment of the visuals.\\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\r\nI don't have much to commentate about here. There are rarely any points where the art specifically struck me as something to be held in high regard. The art is solid, no doubt, but it doesn't shine with high budget and fluid action too often.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it does shine, though, it does so nigh-perfectly. Action packed moments that are animated well show great, and its madhouse animators doing their job right.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\r\nHunter x Hunter made me cry. It made me yell in both anger and confusion, as well as in climatic victory. I'm usually dull faced when I watch anime. I'm easily excited sometimes, but I've cried only 5 or so times at anime. Being able to pull my heart strings like that is, in my opinion, an amazing feat for a writer.\\n\\n\r\nNot only that, but the series had me consistently saying \"What's next\" only to stare at  the episode count in sadness. Since its conclusion, I've taken up the manga, and anxiously await the next chapter.\\n\\n\r\nPlease. Watch Hunter x Hunter for 12 episodes or so. If you are not captivated by then, drop it.",

            "content": "Hunter x Hunter, shortly after completing this masterpiece I finally figured out why it's even called that, despite knowing almost nothing about this show going into it, with my only key words being \"shounen\" \"action\" and \"very very long\". But now, 148 episodes of pure epicness later, I can say with extreme confidence that this is one of the best anime made to date, and why it should take up a spot on your favourite's list.\r\nStory:  10\r\nWow, what an absolute adventure, the story may not grasp you in the first few episodes, but once your hooked, you can't stop. HxH follows the story ofGon Freecss, a young boy who plans to embark on a journey to find his father, who abandoned his son to become a hunter, an occupation in their world which constitutes doing whatever you want, as long as you do it well. Gon takes on the hunter exam to become a hunter himself, to firstly see what it's all about. During the exam he meets fellow exam takers Kurapika, Leorio and Killua, who all have brilliant back stories and motives. (with the exception of Leorio, no dark stuff for him) Gon quickly makes friends with all of them, and the story proceeds with their adventures together. The story consists of about 6 arcs, varying in length, and all feature different characters with fantastic roles. All these arcs can sometimes feel slow to get into after finishing the previous arc, but as aforementioned, once it grabs you, you can't stop. One of my friends who had been watching this as it aired described watching it only once a week as \"hell\"\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nThe art of HxH is fantastic, far better than the original (although that is expected) The character designs are fantastic, and keep the best aspects of the original artwork, while maintaining a good design. The fight scenes of this show are absolutely stunning, all the colours and vibrant punches thrown never get old, and with the surplus of surprises in the story, the artwork simply compliments the already perfect flow of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nI think only one thing needs to be said here: *ahem* YOU CAN SMIIIIIIIIIILE AGAIIIIIN!!!!!!!!\\n\\n\r\nAh, but in all seriousness that opening will never feel boring, and will never be skipped. Both versions of \"Departure\" are fantastic, and suit the show so well. Now the endings though, these blew me away, especially \"Hunting for your dream\" played through the Yorknew City Arc, was just too good, I listened to that song everyday, and still do, the ed for most of the Chimera Ant Arc, \"Nagareboshi Kirari\" was also fantastic. Amazing choice of music, and the ambient, suspenseful, happy, sad, and every other kind of music used in this show could not have been better, created one of the best atmosphere's every episode.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\r\nLoved almost every character that was introduces throughout this series, even the bad ones like Hisoka, Chrollo, the Chimera Ant King, Etc. The way that all the character's interact with each other is just amazing, they all have their ups and downs, but sometimes you get those badass moments where you can't help but just get this feel-good feeling in your stomach as they obliterate their enemies and save their friends. The relationships between some of the characters, the most obvious being Gon and Killua, is incredible, the friendship between them is questioned throughout the whole series, and there are so many obstacles they must overcome in order to stay friends. The struggles only make the beautiful resolutions feel that much better.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nIt took me a little while to get into the chimera ant thing at first, every other arc was just amazing, can't complain about anything else. Enjoyed every minute to the fullest.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nIf you haven't watched this series, do it, you will 100% not regret it, if you are daunted by the high episode count, watch it arc at a time, and savor the moments that feel best, because when you've finished this anime, the amount of satisfaction you feel inside is only matched by the emptiness of realising it's over, so take action now, and embark on your very own journey of Hunter x Hunter!\\n\\n\r\n~Xeno156",

            "content": "When you watch anime, what makes you sit there and think \"This is something that is worth my time\"--what is the turning point where you fall in love with it's plot and characters where it's hard to criticize it? For many people we all have that one anime where really, you can't think of much (or anything at all) to complain about. Well let me tell you something, Hunter x Hunter could probably be that one.\r\nHunter x Hunter's plot comes across quite simple; the story of Gon Freeccs, a young boy who sets out on a journey after learning his Father isn't dead, in orderto become a Hunter. With an engaging storyline and characters that are both multi-faceted and ones in which the audience can connect with, it's an anime that will definitely leave a good impression on people despite it's surprising lack of popularity. The thing about Hunter x Hunter is that it isn't really like your typical shounen anime. There are some questionable characters and turns in the show where you're left wondering what will happen next, while at the same time adds in a good amount of light-hearted comedy and sentimental moments to ease out the tension. At 148 episodes long divided into seven unique arcs, it's definitely longer than most people are use to (12 - 24 episodes average), but is most definitely worth the extra time and dedication.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in HxH is quite frankly flawless, I applaud Madhouse for their efforts. When you make a comparison of the remake to the original, it's quite astounding how different, yet still fitting, the style is. Another bonus is that the quality of the animation never seems to falter through out the series and pleasantly stays consistant. With plenty of fighting scenes carried out so smoothly, there are times you'll want to pause and go frame by frame just to admire it. Another thing I love is how they show the characters expressions that capture the mood so perfectly, this is even more so during dramatized scenes where there are close ups of characters facial expressions of anger and sadness. The scenery and background are also lovingly done, whether it's the busy streets of York New city or the wild nature of the NGL, it really captures just how open the world is in HxH, where as in many anime the characters can almost feel boxed in by their environments.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound for the series is quite fitting. The OST is particularly great and only progressively gets better as the series goes on. The Chimera Ant arc I found had plenty of wonderful tracks, my particular favourite being the one during Netero vs. Meruem. As for the voices, everyone's voices fit quite perfectly and do a splendid job in portraying their characters.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the characters, it's really incredible how unique each of them are, many of them definitely transcending typical anime archetypes. Togashi has done an amazing job developing them through out the story, even minor characters and the antagonists. You can't help but love everyone simply because of how well they have been portrayed that the audience is easily able to connect with them.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I said that HxH was an anime in which many people could find it hard to complain about, there have been a few things that fit into that very, very small category. One unique element of HxH is the narration of the storyline that is done, while definitely not the first anime to do so, it has a unique way of doing it that sets a different pace to the storyline and add in a bit more dramatization. For some people, including myself, it's an element that only adds to the plot and allows the audience to become more drawn into the show and gives in a third person perspective to how things unfold exactly; for others however, the narration can be a bit of a put off and upset the balance in which people find in it. The narration is used especially during the Chimera Ant arc in which many people can find it to be a bit too heavy. Really it's a hit or miss thing for many people, so this is more so a subject that is set to personal opinion.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing many find can be another issue. The beginning of HxH starts off a bit slow, about three or four episodes it takes for people to really get into it, which can cause some people to drop the show and that leaves me really upset because of how much they will be missing out on due to more or less a lack of patience. But really when you have tons of anime coming out each season, it can be hard to really wittle it down to what is worth your time and what isn't (hint: HxH is definitely worth your time). The Chimera Ant arc again also can have a bit of a pacing issue; as the biggest arc within the anime, it's definitely a long journey in which the audience can feel exhausted about and wondering when exactly it'll be over. There are episodes where you can get bored easily, however I find there is always something that enables the audience to come back and get interested once more.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, when you watch Hunter x Hunter, as with any other anime, a big thing that it comes down to is how much you really enjoyed the show overall. You can get as analytic and deep into it as you want, but how much fun did you have watching it? That's a question only you can answer. For me, I enjoyed Hunter x Hunter immensely. To be honest, it's probably now one of my favourite animes now. It's hard to describe how much you can actually enjoy a show, especially one as well done as Hunter x Hunter; there was a point in the show where I was crying for about two hours straight. While the first few episodes can seem slow and the overall synopsis quite simple and bland, don't let it fool you. Hunter x Hunter is so much more than it appears, and gives to the audience a whole new experience that is hard to deny. So do yourself a favour and go and watch Hunter x Hunter",

It's plot is incredibly superior for its genre, which I believe is the main merit of this series, but it's certainly not the only thing it has to offer.\r\nHxH is by no mean's perfect, but it's pretty close for it's genre, and while it's simply not right to compare it to the shorter series, it'sstill a 10/10 in its own right.\\n\\n\r\nI eagerly await it's continuation, hopefully in the near future, but even if it doesn't this series is well worth a watch.",

            "content": "First review here!\r\nI was skeptical about starting this series at first, and the fact that the first few episodes were a bit dry didn't help.  But I can now say that I am glad that I saw it through to the end.\r\nStory - 10/10\r\nBeginning of the series was a little slow, but once it kicked off, the story started to unravel, revealing all sorts of twists and turns along the way.  It was lighthearted one moment and had me on the verge of tears in the next.  There was a good mix of action, comedy, romance, and all other sorts of goodstuff.  The transitions between different arcs was especially good as well, considering how nicely everything flowed together.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9/10\\n\r\nThe art for this show was one of the main reasons I was hesitant to start the series.  I told myself that if the plot was good (which it was), then I would continue watching it, despite the art style.  But with a few episodes in, I was already in love with the art.  Fight scenes were especially pleasing to look at, although certain parts could have been a bit more developed.  Facial expressions were also a big part to this show, whether they portrayed happiness, sorrow, or anger.  \\n\\n\r\nSound - 9/10 \\n\r\nThe soundtrack for this show is exceptional.  Switching off from moments of silence to heartfelt orchestrated pieces to just overall intense music, not very much felt out of place.  I grew to associate different songs with different characters and there was not really a piece that I disliked.  Although some may dislike the opening song because it was the only opening throughout the entire series, I think it was used well.  All the ending songs were remarkable as well, especially as the end of each episode nicely transitioned into them.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 10/10\\n\r\nHeroes and villains alike, each character had a reason to be somewhere at a certain place and time.  Seeing the main protagonists go about on their journey and grow as characters was very rewarding.  Although there were many, many characters that were introduced, each one was memorable; many made reappearances in different arcs.  Seeing the characters' mental states of mind and internal struggles really pulled the show together, showing that not everyone was as powerful or overpowered as they seemed to be.  Each one was unique, having different abilities suited to their talents and preferences.  Hunter x Hunter has some of the best villains in my opinion, whether I grew to empathize with some or truly just despise others.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10/10\\n\r\nI'm very slow when it comes to watching shows as I need time in between episodes and such.  But with this series, I zipped through the series in two weeks, which is much faster than I had expected.  I couldn't help but keep clicking to each next episode.  Although the beginning and some parts in the middle seemed a little slow, it was all done for good reason.  Everything seemed to come together, from music to character to story, etc.  I really did enjoy this show a lot and am considering to rewatch it after I watch the 1999 version.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10/10\\n\r\nIf I could give Hunter x Hunter a higher rating, I would.  This show has climbed up to the top of my list of favorites and it was an enjoyable ride from start to finish.  Despite the big number of episodes, nothing seemed unnecessary and there was little to no fillers, which I find admirable for such a long show.  All previous doubts I had for this show disappeared once I started it and it really is a must-see show for everyone.",

            "content": "I've been meaning to write a review for this show, but in truth it's hard to word how I feel about HXH.  It's very special, I think,  and is one of those anime that is worthy of a 10/10 rating for me even while not being perfect.  People say this show is under-rated, but this simply isn't the case anymore.  If you go look at the first page of reviews, they're practically all 10/10's.  Now that the show's over, I expect there to be a tidal wave of nay-sayers who pick up on the small flaws this show does haveand begin the \"this show is OVERRATED\" train.  Before we get that sea of 8's, 7's and below, I want to make it clear why this show is worthy of such a high rating.  My greatest fear for this show is that the hype for this show that exists now will cause a lot of people to start tearing it apart in these reviews, trying to prove it's not as good as people think it is.  Whether or it is, the fact remains that it will always be a 10/10 to me and a lot of other people and there ARE reasons.  Put simply, this show IS worth your time.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nThis is an interesting aspect of the show to rate.  If this makes sense, HXH is not very original, but it is extremely unique.  It has a way of taking very common storylines/themes (fighting tournaments, super-human battles, aura-based abilities/leveling up aspects) and while sticking to the typical guns with them in a lot of ways the show provides a unique spin on them.  A big way it does this is with the characters, which definitely fit certain archetypes but have a depth and emotional connection strong enough to make any used plot line feel fresh and new.  A lot of the \"fighting aspects\" are different from other shounen, in that they don't end up stretched out over several episodes and quite often evolve into more of a \"strategic stand-off\" than an all out physical fight to see who can kick more ass.   At it's core, the show is simply about Gon trying to find his father.  The story itself is nothing new (even if well executed), but the twist, turns, character development and eventual scale make this story a solid 9 for me.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nI see a lot of praise for the art here, and while it is certainly not undeserved the art has never been my favorite part of this show.  The character designs all work (with maybe some Chimera Ant exceptions) and it definitely doesn't have the feeling that they were cheap with the animation.  However, although there are some really beautiful scenes that have some amazing imagery to accompany them, the animation didn't typically go above and beyond enough to put it on such a high pedestal.  Definitely not a show where you'll typically hate the art though, so rest easy there.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nAgain, I feel similarly on the sound as I do with the art.  Really nothing bad here, either; in fact, the music accompanies the show extremely well and at times it adds a whole lot to a scene.  The intro has grown on me quite a bit, although I feel like you either like it or you don't and it won't take you too long to decide.  Honestly, I might have gone with a 9 here if the in-show music didn't get a LITTLE repetitive at times (particularly in earlier arcs).  As with the art though,the sound is solid and will typically only add to your enjoyment of the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nThis is one of the major elements of the show that I feel bring it to a 10.  If you are bothered by the trope of an over-powered character, you may find this show either really annoying or a huge breath of fresh air.  The characters are constantly growing more and more powerful, and as the time goes by some ridiculously strong characters are introduced.  However, at least with the main characters, they do not just start off awesome as in some shows.  There is a huge learning curve for the main characters, and you are really able to see them grow in terms of ability and character.  And especially as it progresses, the show is pretty good about keeping morality pretty gray, not forgetting that even the most interesting of protagonists must have flaws and vices to make them real.  Even when it brings in a bunch of new characters with a lot of focus late in the game, by the end of their arc you will be able to see them in a whole new light.  What can I say, the character development in HXH is TIGHT.  If you're looking for a journey where you will really care about the characters and the changes they go through, this is definitely a show for you.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nThis. This is what makes the show a 10 for me.  You can nit-pick over details and tiny flaws all day.  At the end of the day, I seriously enjoyed all 148 episodes of this show, and I typically am more fond of shorter ones (usually don't go above 25).  I'm not sure I've ever seen a show I could binge in such a hardcore way.  Everything from laughs, to thrills, to the eventual change in tone.  You know, where you have to stop and try to figure out when this stopped being a light-hearted (if violent) show about powerful 12 year-olds and when it became a dark thriller that has you on the edge of your seat.  There are definitely some strong feels here too, particularly later  on.  All I can say in this category is that it's hard to think of may shows I've genuinely enjoyed this much, anime or otherwise.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nMy opinion is obviously very high for this show, and I'm definitely not the only one.  I'm writing this review for one reason alone: to recommend this show as fairly as I can.  Though my vote is a 10/10, it is certainly not the only valid rating for this show.  I think it all depends on what makes or breaks a show for you.  My main goal is to break it down in a way that will give you an idea of it's the show for you or not.\\n\r\nPROS:  Excellent character depth, thrilling plot, long journey with great payoff, a whole lot of heart, light-hearted enough to keep you invested in the characters and not weighed down by the intensity (sometimes) but dark enough at times to fully contrast this and remind you that this is NOT a show for children, and a LOT of interesting people, places, creatures, and powers.\\n\r\nCONS: There are so many characters that sometimes you may go a long time without seeing one of your favorites, the show is very long- while some people are addicted enough not to notice, it's still over100 (which isn't too bad for shounen like this but still), and in some of the longer arcs (looking at you, Chimera Ant) seem to stretch a bit at the middle.  \\n\r\nEnd of the day, this is something special and it deserves the time to give it a shot.",

            "content": "Well, let me tell you, that I'm not usually easily impressed nor do I usually write reviews; however, there are always exceptions and this anime is one of them.\r\nI loved this anime; the plot, characters and overall anime was amazing; which left me confused when I learned that a lot of my fellow anime watchers didn't like it; and one of the main reason was that 'it looked childish,' and can I just confirm that, this anime is far from it!\r\nStory:\r\nI don't want to spoil anyone, so this bit may come across a little vague; but I'll try my best! Anyway, the story line wasgreat, as far as I know, there wasn't any glaringly obvious plot holes and the plotline was beautifully developed. Compared to other ~long~ animes (animes which have over 50 episodes) all episodes were relevant and didn't contain much 'filler' episodes; or at least, that's what it felt like. The main story line never diverged and kept true to its main point which was, the protagonist, 'Gon' trying to find his father. As with most animes, there are also sub-plots and the subplots were also masterfully done; they were never too 'powerful' that it feels like the main 'quest' have been forgotten; they were enjoyable, yet, to the point.\\n\\n\r\nGoing back to the 'childish' thing going on, it is far from it; the anime as a whole is gripping and is very dark; (quite similar to Puella Madoka Magica, where the art style may seem bright and friendly; but the plot is a monster of feels and tears and anything in between). It is a great balance of light-hearted as we see the characters build close bonds with each other, to the comedic antics of other characters to the sorrowful and regrettable deaths of some. To those of you who are seeking romance, well, there is also romance in there.\\n\\n\r\nIn all honestly, one of the main reasons for my confusion as to why Hunter X Hunter isn't as popular as other animes (such as Naruto, One Piece and Bleach) is the plot. Hunter X Hunter's plot is ultimately told better, clearer and with much more catharsis than others I know. It has all the elements in it and memorable characters that a fantastic anime needs and a good plotline to boot without too much fan service (there are some, but not overwhelmingly so, that it ruins the show) It is immersive and will leave you speechless. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nSo, the art... I believe the art is one of the reasons, many 'modern' otakus out there tend to scroll by due to the fact that the front cover conveys a very sweet, bright and happy anime; in which all Hunter X Hunter watchers know that it isn't true.\\n\\n\r\nThe dynamic art style creates a great contrast between its 'happy' episodes and episodes where there is carnage everywhere; which , for me, creates a stronger impact when one watches it.\\n\\n\r\nBefore, someone questions me about it, yes. Yes I have seen the 1999 version of the anime; and it's also good, however, I do prefer the 2011 version. In all honesty, the anime is just as good either versions; so, go for the art style you prefer!  The only reason (and it can be seen as quite silly, I know)  that I prefer the 2011 version is probably that the characters' eyes are more defined and I find that incredibly alluring and absolutely beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI'm going to be honest with you here, I'm a 'watch the opening songs and ending songs once and skip it after that' kind of watcher; so, I don't really have much to say on this topic, however, for the times I've heard it, I actually liked it and I usually don't pay mind to most anime songs. the use of music while watching the episodes are done well and match the atmosphere of whatever the character is doing at the time.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nOh my gosh! I can not emphasize enough how wonderful the characters are! First of all, there is a plethora of characters which are well-developed and break the most of the character tropes. The intense, complicated backstories alone is enough to hook you in.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters' aesthetics are drawn wonderfully, but the personalities that go with these faces are on another stupendous level. The way the protagonists develop and affect each other is slow, yet fluid. There's no rush nor is there any 'unnatural', suddenly-this-happened-and-I-don't-know-how things occurring during character developments.\\n\r\nAll characters have a role and all of them are relevant. Even the villains. And for me, that's rare.\\n\\n\r\nIn most animes I've watched, villains are usually just there to be villains; there usually isn't any development on their part; once evil. always evil. In the case of Hunter X Hunter, however, the villains are gloriously well-developed and it is obvious that they are well thought out. before watching this, there wasn't a single villain that I didn't want to get killed as they are usually very two dimensional; however, this series had THE villain. The villain that you knew has their faults and will probably deserve the death that comes to them, but then, something happens and, dear Oedipus, suddenly; you just want to desperately save them! (y'all know who I'm talking about...)\\n\\n\r\nI feel as if I don't have enough eloquence to tell you how amazing these characters are, but, they are amazing! Don't just take my word for it, watch it!!\\n\\n\r\nAs for the rating...The ONLY reason I gave this a '9' is that, I felt as if my favourite character didn't have enough screen time; but then again, he's kinda like an anti-hero so, maybe it isn't as unjustified as I think it is.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nEnjoyment? Are you kidding me? For me, this was a masterpiece!!!! Even without the popcorn, hotdogs and candy I managed to consume during I watched it; and that's saying a lot! I like my food, ya know?\\n\r\nIn all seriousness though, It's gripping and immersive. the amount of empathy, sorrow and laughter you'll share with these characters will be unreal. let me tell you now, that this is the only anime I have watched and actually cried over a character. That's saying a lot! I don't cry. Ever. Well, at least not when watching something.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nI love it. It's one of those 'classics,' ya know? It never gets old and will never get old. I still think that this should have a greater fan base and I will be forever confused and shocked as to why it doesn't. It is definitely in my top 10 and possibly top 5 and I'm not easily impressed.\\n\\n\r\nDefinitely has a high 're-watch' rating as I've re-watched this at least 5 times already. It's one of those go-to animes when you want something good and familiar and something that you know won't let you down.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend it to everyone; especially if you have good taste in anime. ;)\\n",

            "content": "Suffice to say, I cannot explain Hunter X Hunter (2011) in just a few words. I\u2019m a little late on the hype because I waited for the remake to finish before I could watch it as a whole; but anyway, right now, I\u2019m on the verge of extracting my feelings to all of you after watching yet again a fantastic shounen anime.  \r\nI\u2019ll just let you know that I\u2019ve watched the first series before the remake and I might give off some short comparison between the two in some parts of my review (please do not get annoyed). However, that does not mean thatthe other is superior to the other.  Don\u2019t worry; I will not give any spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nELEMENTS OF THE STORY\\n\\n\r\nPLOT - It\u2019s tiring to even say the synopsis so I\u2019ll have to get to the point. I loved how the author arranged the arcs in an organized way. It isn\u2019t confusing and you will definitely have fun trying to remember those moments. Also, you can actually tell which part is which. Lastly, every arc is enjoyable and encouraging to see in their most valuable way. Let me describe each of those.\\n\\n\r\n1.\tHunter Exam \u2013 It is one of the most highlighted events in the lives of the 4 characters; Gon, Killua, Kurapika, and Leorio. For the most part, in this event you will see more action, less dramatic happenings and a lot more challenges that you could think of. Just participating in the exam is horrifying.\\n\\n\r\n2.\tZoldyck Family \u2013 Killua is quite peculiar but more so, his family is also strange but a lot more. In this arc, there will be more tests that the comrades will face that are as difficult as the vicious Hunter Exam.\\n\r\n3.\tHeavens Arena and Nen \u2013 This one is as far as I\u2019m concerned, one of the most entertaining part of the show. I can recall how the characters experienced hell in Heavens Arena (ironic right?) expect more short battles and exciting kicks of the main characters. You will definitely enjoy most of the fights in this show. Oh, and they will learn a new skill that is pretty badass.\\n\\n\r\n4.\tAuction and Phantom Rogue \u2013 a group that Kurapika serves as a mortal enemy. The four friends face the horrifying and powerful thieves or were they assassins? They are a bit of both.  You will witness more bloodshed and nail-biting as Kurapika et al gamble their lives on defeating the most terrifying criminals that can defeat thousands of armies. \\n\\n\r\n5.\tGreed Island \u2013 If you love a good real life video game, I guess you will appreciate this arc. Gon believes that this game has a clue on seeing his Dad so along with Killua and a bunch of new friends, they will win this game and complete the requirements needed. I guess this arc gives the two a no sweat battle. \\n\\n\r\n6.\tChimera Ants \u2013 One word, disturbing. And another one, it\u2019s disgusting. The characters travel on to the next phase of their lives as they discover a new organism in a country, they are called, Chimera ants. You might already have an idea on what a chimera is if you\u2019ve watched the Fullmetal Alchemist franchise. Chimeras are animals infused with human personalities and maybe bodies. Some may look like pure animals but in a way, they look a little evolved. Ants and the human race will get to combat on who will snatch the spot on the top of the food chain. Unexpected deaths will rise and most especially, it has a touch of drama behind it. I really cried in some parts. This arc also helped in honing the development of the characters.\\n\\n\r\n7.\tElection and Alluka \u2013 This one has less fights. It\u2019s more of a relaxed part of the show. There are minimal battles because of the aftermath on the Chimera Ants match. This arc has more logical thinking and it is also risky. Tears and blood will be shed but for the most part, the ending will cap a new beginning for all of the characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe explanation may not be too long for you guys to understand but I suppose this is my vivid description for most of the relevant parts of the story.\\n\r\nFor the sudden comparison, Hunter X Hunter 2011 is better in delivering the story. It has a fast pacing of the turnover of events which is quite more pleasing to use that the old anime. At first, before encountering Hunter X Hunter 2011, I was devastated when I learned that they cut a bunch of funny and entertaining scenes from the manga that was shown from the 1999 series; for example, the famous sushi episode, where it was hard for the characters to please the examiner. On the other hand, I was awakened by the fact that it wasn\u2019t important and either way, the story would\u2019ve advanced even without that part. There is also the fact that it took almost 30 episodes to air the Hunter Exam from the old anime while, in the remake it only took 20 or less episodes. You can never get bored with the both of them but if you\u2019ve already watched the 1999 version, I guess you will understand that fast paced is much superior. However, with the chimera arc, it took like 60 or more episodes to actually visualized and explains the battle. Anyway, the story was longer than in the 1999 version which only ended until the Greed Island arc.\\n\\n\r\nSETTING and ENDING - The settings of the show gave a fulfilling representation of the bizarre yet colorful life of hunters. You will see the vast changes of one arc from the other. I think the bright and refined color of the backgrounds made the show more interesting to watch. The ending was just\u2026 WOW. There is no word to explain it. Yeah, somehow it didn\u2019t satisfy the ending for the other characters but I guess it turned out pretty awesome. Thank you, Togashi Yoshihiro. You and your brilliance will shine forever! I hope the story continues on in the manga! \\n\r\nCHARACTERS \u2013 I\u2019m not supposed to take this in a long explanation but I guess I\u2019ll have to say it. Hunter X Hunter has a lot of wide ranged characters. You can actually see the depth and differences between personalities and distinguish them just by looking at their faces. The character design was just flawless in terms of personality but in appearance\u2026 not so much. I guess most of the main characters are built up with flat development. Gon Freecs have almost no change with his personality which is predictable but the only development he had to encounter is his hatred and his powers. This one took place in the chimera ant arc. You can see how he changed from the sweetest and kindest character in the story, well, he still is. On the other hand, his emotions changed as he meets new villains and disappointments. The thrill is in with Gon. Leorio is also a flat character. He is aggressively stupid and a bit fond of women. \u2018Til the very end, he is the epitome of a stupid and weak hunter but he knows how to overcome that with the help of his friends. Kuapika has a minimal development like Gon. He has potential in yielding his powers and he gets even stronger than before because of revenge. Kurapika is always level-headed but as the story goes on, he cannot control the hidden anguish inside his heart. To be honest, Killua has the most development out of all the characters. He was once a good child, following the demands of his family but as he grew, he realized that there were more treasured people outside of the world. His realization with the world and the discovery that he gathers each time he spends with Gon, helps him to grow and advance into a different person. For the villains, Hisoka is the oddest and scariest of all. I can\u2019t even figure out his true motive. He could be an enemy or an ally. He\u2019s just so confusing and there is no telling whether he is going to kill Gon or not. The other character that caught my attention would be, Meruem. He is a round character for he develops a sensibility inside of him that gives him a sturdy ideology between people and ants. \\n\\n\r\nEFFECTS:\\n\r\nSOUND \u2013 The opening does not condemn me at all. I think the song is a bit off for me. It isn\u2019t my taste and I\u2019m sorry for the comparison but, 1999 version wins when it comes to the opening song. Ohayo will always be my favorite anime song. On the bright side, the 2011 version did great on background music. I enjoy watching the show because of the OST. For the voice dub, I prefer Japanese because the 1999 English dub was just BAD. Notable voices captured my attention such as Sawashiro Miyuki who has the most recognizable voice in the show and Miyano Mamoru. The rest did a really good work.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION \u2013 Madhouse is in charge of mostly dark anime series like Nana, Death Note and so on.  They are an expertise when producing a dark feel to the show; at the same time, producing an amusing side as well. I love their flexibility when it comes to shows. I hope they serve as an example to other production staff as well. Oh, and they make good chibis. What else, I gues this one has a vibrant color than the old series. I have an issue with Hisoka\u2019s hair, Killua\u2019s fashion sense, and other stuff but I guess both versions are weird in their own ways. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT and OVERALL\\n\r\nI definitely had a nice catch with this one. Hunter X Hunter makes a lot of surprises and changes. It has potential in seeking selected audiences with its dark themed and it is full of action. It has everything what a shonen anime makes or represents. Cool characters caring for their friends, anonymous and surprising villains, funny moments, decent quotes and a lot more. I guess I\u2019m writing too much adlib. My favorite parts of this anime (I\u2019m acting like a kid right now I\u2019m sorry) are the Bromance of Gon and Killua, Kurapika\u2019s successful yet failing vengeance, Leorio\u2019s motivation with his friends, Hisoka\u2019s peculiarity, and strong hunters.. especially, the chairman. I\u2019m quite relieved that this ranked 94 in popularity because sometimes popular shows are the most awful ones *coughs*, Fairy Tail, *coughs*, Kuroko no Basuke, *coughs*, so many more. Nevertheless, please watch this awesome anime. Mind you, both versions are both recommendable, I\u2019m sure you will enjoy both shows at a high rate.  I\u2019m even running out of words on how to describe it. You\u2019ll get hooked and will be hooked with this exceptional, special, extraordinary, incomparable, outstanding, remarkable, amazing, unique\u2026 Fuck! I need a thesaurus! Please Watch Hunter X Hunter 2011!\\n",

It completely crushed the norm of any shonen jump anime that I've ever seen to be quite honest.\r\nThe characters are all unique and you can tell how much thought was put into each of them. The plot has never bored me once; always twisting and turning any chance that it gets. On top of that, the animation is phenomenal when it truly needs to be.\r\nFrom the outside, this anime does not look like much, but I promise you, it is worth the watch. It is everything ananime should be.",

            "content": "I lot of people who dislike shonen have this misconception that all long running series are alike such as Dragon Ball or Naruto and thus give up on any potential great series that have great writing and character development such as Hunter x Hunter. I say to those who dislike shonen I do not blame you. However HxH isn't your typical shonen that tries to impress you with big fights and explosions but rather it gives you a well written and executed story and fights that are amazing because of what they symbolize.\r\nStory & World - 10\r\nThe world in this anime is very creative anddetailed allowing for complete immersion. This benefits the overall story as it allows the viewer to get completely dragged into the story and the world at the same time. The concept of Hunters is an exciting concept as it allows our main character to start his adventure. Hunters are people who travel and explore different aspects of the world and discover the unknown. This is a perfect combination for the world itself since the Hunter universe is well built and makes us want to see more of it. The concept of a Hunter allows for a reason to explore this beautiful world and see the unseen. The story is both light hearted and dark at times. Do not let its exterior fool you. This anime may look \"happy\" and \"kiddy\" on the outside but it can be just as dark as anime such as Attack on Titan at times. This anime mixes both light tone and dark tone elements together and I personally love both themes. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are equally as important when it comes to creating a masterful story. You can't have a good story unless you have engaging characters and the same can be said for vice versa. Hunter x Hunter definitely doesn't fail when it comes to creating complex and interesting characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe relationship between Gon and Killua is extremely well done. We see their friendship and bond strengthen throughout the series to the point where you begin to deeply admire their relationship. This is strongly influenced by Killua's past. This is one of the more heart-warming aspects of this series. The writer allows a great deal of insight into our main protagonists psychology through narration. This adds to the intensity and emotion as we see our character develop. This show has the best and most intense development I have ever seen in a shonen. Not just for a shonen but overall as well. An example would be the emotional physiological trauma we see one of our main characters experience. It is intense and shocking at the same time and will have you at the edge of your seat. We see Gon's innocence completely destroyed at one point and see a completely darker side to him.\\n\\n\r\nKurapika is also one such character who we get to see a darker side too. At the beginning we know he's hell bent on revenge but unlike some people (Sasuke) he's not willing to sacrifice his friends for it. At the beginning he's introduced as a clever and calculative thinker. Later on we see a completely different side to him in the eyes of his families killers. He becomes cold hearted and brutal. A truly disturbing aspect, one which will send shivers down your spine.\\n\\n\r\nThe side characters are some of the best and most exciting side characters a series can have. We have Hisoka the weird, pedophile who gets turned on by... even weirder things. The phantom troupe. They're incredible villains. However there's more to them than just being villains. They have a more complex psychology. Sure they \"kill\" and do bad things but it's the relationships they have with one another that sparks my interest about them. Along with each member of the troupe being very unique with very different personalities from each other. It's interesting to watch how everything plays out when they interact with each other. Their relationship is complex and you're not fully sure what to think of it. Do they care about each other? Or do they want to kill each other? These characters are only a few of the many interesting side characters we have in the show. I haven't even gotten to the Zoldycks yet.\\n\\n\r\nSound/Art - 10/10 MOVIE QUALITY\\n\\n\r\nThis is where Hunter x Hunter shines even brighter. The animation is consistently amazing throughout the series. Madhouse truly are to be thanked for this. This series wouldn't be as good if it weren't for the amazing execution and direction of each episode. The ost's are amazing especially in the chimera ant arc. If it weren't for the amazing ost's some scenes wouldn't be as impactful as they are. The openings and credit songs are amazing. They're very memorable and catchy and offer a sort of nostalgic feel because of how they're able to capture the series. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - Masterpiece!\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a great story and characters with a lot of shock factor and twists this is a perfect anime. The world and characters easily get you attached and there's a lot of shock factor because of the well done twists which will honestly leave you jaw dropped. This anime is also perfect if you're looking for something less cliche in the shonen genre and something unique. This anime easily impresses anyone who has a taste for artisticness when it comes to Hunter x Hunter. Hunter x Hunter is an art. Truly a rare and amazing gem.",

            "content": "[MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD]\r\nPeople tell me I'm overly cynical. When it comes to new movies, games, shows, or anything really, I'm the first to offer a dose of skepticism and resistance to believe in a production's hype. So when I say I think something is a \"masterpiece\", I mean I think everyone should get off their ass and experience it immediately.\r\nThis has proven difficult with Hunter x Hunter, primarily due to its art-style. You see that art-style? That's what Hunter x Hunter is all about. Subverting expectations and proving that you really can't judge a book by its cover. If you're looking at this anime andthinking it might be too childish, I can assure you that it is not. Hunter x Hunter is a shounen anime that defies its genre constantly and defiantly. It is not for typical shounen viewers. It can be dark, depressing, tragic, and often emotionally draining if you get invested in the characters. That being said, I am not going to sit here and tell you why I think you might like Hunter x Hunter. I'm telling you why you need to sit down and watch the 2011 adaptation of Hunter x Hunter right now. Let's begin!\\n\\n\r\n-Art/Animation-\\n\\n\r\nFirst off, the animation in this show is AMAZING. The animation is silky smooth and very rarely is there evidence of animation shortcuts. If you want an example of one of the few instances of obviously poor animation, there's a few frames of animation where Colt is discovering how to activate his Nen after being punched by Rammot. The animation is very ugly and I think it was someone else animating that or maybe they just forgot it and had to animate last second? I don't know. But other than that, everything is wonderful, full of color, and a clear product of solid direction.  Madhouse poured a lot of money into this production and it certainly shows. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the art style itself, it's a bit of a distraction. The designs of the main characters make sense once you're fully introduced to them, but I was immensely confused when I first started watching. The images I saw, along with the name of the show (Hunter x Hunter) led me to believe that it was going to be some shounen with monster hunting and not much else. Really, I don't know why they're called hunters when the association is responsible for far more than just hunting beasts. That's neither here nor there though. One of the underlying morals of the show is \"Don't judge a book by its cover\" and the name and art certainly convey that well. \\n\\n\r\nArt and animation get an A+.\\n\\n\r\n-Sound-\\n\\n\r\nSound was the one area I saw getting the most criticism, which I still don't understand. Maybe people just don't understand music placement? The score in Hunter x Hunter is unreal. It's seriously amazing. Ambient, emotional, poetic; it fits in so many scenes so well that I'm stunned that people think this is the worst part of the show. Really, there's only one bad song in the show and that's the first closing song. The same intro is used for all 148 songs and in some strange way it never gets tiring due to the fact that they change verses for each arc. Plus, it's seriously great. \"Departure!\" has definitely leaped into my list of favorite anime openings ever. \\n\\n\r\nBefore I move on to the story, I'm going to elaborate on what I meant by music placement. Music placement is the art of placing a piece of music on your timeline. It is something that is frequently overlooked and forgotten but I want to stress here just how wonderful a job they did here. If you've ever had an instance where a piece of music comes in and you're thrown off by how jarring or inappropriate it is, that's bad music placement. Sometimes the right mood can be pulled off by inserting a song later into a scene rather than sooner, or if the creator is really brilliant he'll pull the score out completely. There's three such instances in this anime I want to highlight in particular.\\n\\n\r\nIn episode 131 (if you've seen it, you know where I'm going with this), Gon goes through his famous breakdown after being informed by Neferpitou that Kite has been dead all along and she basically lied to him when she told her she would travel to Peijing to heal him. Gon goes absolutely berserk, transforming into an insanely powerful advanced-age version of himself. Throughout the entire scene, the score changes rapidly from song to song as the tone gets darker and darker. This scene is full of so many intense and raw emotions that there was simply no way they could have covered it with just one piece. It starts with intense choral music, then by the time Killua sees Gon, transfers to a very soft piano piece to establish the mood perfectly for an emotional character moment between the two. And the effect is unreal. There is so much tension and hatred conveyed by the score and visuals yet the overall tone of the scene isn't lost amidst the frantic changes in music. That is NOT easy to pull off.\\n\\n\r\nExample #2 involves the character Melody. I'll talk about her more later, so for now we'll talk about the music itself. Melody has a very soothing piece she plays known as \"No no Haru.\" This piece of music, when played by her (she emits her Aura into a flute), heals others' injuries and illness and calms the person listening. She plays these 2 significant times that I recall specifically in the Yorknew City arc, but that's not what I'm getting at here. Twice more, in later arcs, the same music is used in a different context and bizarrely enough the viewer gets the same relaxing and soothing effect as when it's played by Melody. This leaves an odd sort of Pavlovian response in the audience, as they're feeling the same emotion without the previous stimulus. It's something I honestly don't think I've ever seen before. \\n\\n\r\nAs for example #3, we'll look at episode 135. Episode 135 is the heart-breaking episode that closes the Chimera Ant arc, wherein Meurem and Komugi spend their final moments together playing Gungi together. To say this scene is beautiful is underselling it massively. This is simply one of the most emotional and well-crafted character scenes I've ever seen across any medium. During the last few moments of the episode, there are a few lines of dialogue overlayed with cuts of Meurem's En particles piercing the pitch black, along with Komugi holding Meurem in her arms. There is no music playing during any of these lines. The dialogue says everything and the complete silence outside of the lines being delivered creates an unbelievably tragic atmosphere. Only about 40 seconds into the scene does the music kick in, and by that point the scene alone has already dictated the tone. It doesn't feel like you're watching two characters from a TV show spending their final moments together. It feels like you're right there with them. It's so well-done and emotional that I honestly can't even talk about it without tearing up. Let's just move on...\\n\\n\r\nSounds gets an A+.\\n\\n\r\n-Story-\\n\\n\r\nThe bread and butter of Hunter x Hunter is the story. The 2011 Hunter x Hunter anime adaptation encompasses the Hunter Exam arc, Zoldyck Family arc, Heavens Arena arc, Yorknew City arc, Greed Island arc, Chimera Ant arc, and 13th Hunter Chairman Election arc. The Chairman Election is essentially an epilogue due to it closing the show. \\n\\n\r\nIf I'm being honest, I don't have much to say about any of the first 5 arcs. While they're all great, they aren't the reason I'm writing this. What inspired me to share my love for this anime was, as you probably guessed, the Chimera ant arc. Hell, I wouldn't be writing this review at all if not for that arc. Now I'm not going to sit here and offer up philosophical implications and parallels to history, as that's been covered elsewhere. We're going to crack open this arc and see what makes it work so well. \\n\\n\r\nFirst off, a typical sign of great writing in general is a large pool of set-ups and payoffs. A la, you introduce a plot element or character trait, and then after a certain point, you take that element and resolve it. The Chimera ant arc is an example of complete mastery of this art. I mean no exaggeration when every plot element I recall being introduced and set up in this arc was also paid off within it. Every single plot element and incident has a purpose. Nothing goes to waste. When I was initially scribbling down notes for this review, I decided I would take one specific, seemingly insignificant detail they highlighted to see if they paid it off. At one point, I noticed Knov take off his shoes after getting blood on them. I honestly didn't think they would use it as a setup despite noting it, but...I was wrong. A few episodes or so later and Welfin notices a pair of bloody shoes and uses them as evidence in the incident he's investigating. There's a set-up and a payoff. And that's just a detail that doesn't even really matter; the point is that they go well out of their way to re-incorporate previous plot points or ideas. In fact, some of the more emotional scenes in this arc comes specifically as a result of some previous setup.\\n\\n\r\nTake for example, the moment when Reina (reborn as a a Chimera ant) re-unites with her mother. This wasn't some random incident meant to give the audience a false feeling of warmth. There was a setup that led to that point. Very early in the arc, a pair of children (brother and sister) are attacked by a Chimera ant, killed, eaten, and turned into ant soldiers. The little boy tries protecting the girl, pleading her to run, before being killed by the monster. The girl tries to run but is frozen with fear. That little girl was Reina. Set-up and payoff. In an earlier scene, Colt is seen by the Queen's side following the birth of Meurem. As the other Royal Guard no longer care for the Queen now that the King has been born, Colt is forced to sit and watch in anguish and helplessness as his mother dies before him. He weeps as she dies and proclaims his frustration at his failure to protect his mother. Just after saying that, it shows a flashback to that same scene from earlier, a little boy failing to protect his sister. That little boy was Colt. His guilt for not being able to protect a loved one (his words not mine!) have just been increased tenfold and the audience can feel the weight of the emotional distress cast upon Colt. One set-up leads to two payoffs involving 2 different characters. That's what I'm getting at. It's about not taking shortcuts and using your own plot points to dictate the story rather than some absurd vision filled with deus ex machina and plot holes. It's what gives this arc, and the whole show, life and fantastic vision. \\n\\n\r\nThe writing in general is certainly a strong point. Stakes are always established and explored, character motivations always clear (mostly) and every action a character makes is one that would help them or get them closer to what they want to achieve, there are tons of arcs for characters you wouldn't expect, and the rules for Nen are established early and held firm. Weird, right? You take the basics of storytelling for granted until a show like this comes around and makes it a staple of its presentation to get it right.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a few problems with the storytelling though that initially had me leaning towards giving the show a 9 instead of a 10. Throughout the show, the writers have a bit of a hard time delivering exposition. Oftentimes during fights or in really obvious exposition scenes, all action and plot is stopped to explain indirectly what is happening. Take for example the scene where Hisoka is explaining to Machi how he beat Kastro, in a very long and drawn-out scene that exists to establish Machi's powers and explain in detail how Hisoka's power works. The problem is this scene drags way too long and outlives its purpose. Exposition is best delivered while something else is happening. Either through creative framing or having a character moment are good ways to keep the action moving works well, but just sitting there not moving the plot forward is not a good way to do it. This becomes a very big problem during the Chimera ant arc.\\n\\n\r\nThat arc is plagued by excessive and redundant narration that drags the story out to a horrifically slow pace. I don't know what happened that made them decide that there needed to be narration explaining things that just happened or things that could have been told visually, but it gets irritating real fast if you're like me and hate being told what can be shown.\\n\\n\r\nAs such, the story gets an A.\\n\\n\r\n-Characters-\\n\\n\r\nNow, we come to the true strength of Hunter x Hunter. The characters. This is one of the best casts of characters I have ever come across. Nearly every single character in the show is likable or relatable in some way, and it feels as though they're always evolving.\\n\\n\r\nWe'll move in order. First off, you have the main 4 characters; Gon, Killua, Kurapika, and Leorio. Gon and Killua are our main characters for the entire show. \\n\\n\r\nWe'll start with Gon. Gon is a simple-minded but determined 12-year old boy who serves as the primary protagonist. He has oddly heightened senses and his curiosity often takes precedence over his fear. His wish is to become a Hunter to discover why his father chose being a Hunter over being Gon's father. His flaws lie in his impulsiveness and fiery temper. He can be a bit short-sighted, and often feels the need to compulsively prove others wrong who doubt him. He also can become so angry that he loses sight of everything else around him. He has a propensity for not understanding when an opponent is far superior to him due to his own confidence, which has gotten him into hot water a few times.\\n\\n\r\nYou know what that was? Character traits, character motivation, and character flaws. You know those things that other shows sometimes forget to include like weakness, vulnerability, and drive? Yeah, they didn't forget here. \\n\\n\r\nAs for Killua? Killua is Gon's best friend, and is basically the second protagonist (moreso during the Chairman Election arc). He's quick-thinking and very confident in his abilities. His reason for initially taking the Hunter exam was \"for fun\", but he ends up creating a friendship with Gon that blossoms throughout the series. At the same time, he's a bit reckless with his own life and often puts others before himself without thought. He also struggles to face enemies that appear to be stronger than him. He would always take flight instead of attempting to fight and overcome a stronger opponent. This is brought to a head when Bisky calls him out on it and forces him to face his weakness head on. Given the opportunity to just run like always, Killua buckles down and, after a vicious struggle, overcomes his weakness and becomes all the more stronger for it.\\n\\n\r\nThat last part? That's a character arc. Yeah, where characters change and grow like real people. I'll spare you two more winded paragraphs on Kurapika and Leorio to talk more about how brilliantly the characters are utilized in the show.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I talked about how Hunter x Hunter earlier is basically an exercise of the mantra \"Don't judge a book by its cover\", I was mostly referring to characters. There are a slew of characters that defy common tropes and challenge the audience to re-evaluate the way they see people and how they empathize towards other people. \\n\\n\r\nMy first example is the above mentioned Melody. To put it bluntly, Melody is not exactly an attractive person physically. She's short and rather stocky. She has a huge bald spot on her head and her front teeth are like a rat's. But she wasn't always this way. Upon listening to a single movement of the Sonata of Darkness, a piece apparently composed by the devil himself, her skin was warped; her flesh exposed and leaving her rather unattractive looking. However, her character itself is what makes her fascinating. She is unusually kind and calm, and is unusually attuned to the feelings of others. Her goal is to find and destroy the Sonata so that no one else has to suffer the same fate as her. Melody is a challenge issued by the author. You're never shown what she looked like before. What you see before you is what you get. The question the author is asking is: Can you empathize with someone who looks like a rat, and society would tell you is \"ugly\"? Can you look past her exposed flesh and balding head and find beauty in her strong personality, even after such a disastrous fate has befallen her? Personally I found her presence moving and very endearing.\\n\\n\r\nMy second example is actually my favorite character in the entire show, Komugi. Komugi, physically, is a young girl with thick black eyebrows, simple attire and a simple appearance, punctuated by an unsightly strand of snot hanging from each of her nostrils. She's clumsy, she clearly has a lisp, and her overall demeanor is not what I would call appealing. Oh yeah, did I mention she's blind? \\n\\n\r\nWhile I do adore her character design, it's her personality that made me immediately invest myself in her emotionally. Komugi is the world champion Gungi player, summoned by Meurem to be defeated by him along with several other strategy game champions. Naturally, Meurem initially underestimates her, balking at the mere idea of her beating him. And as everyone expected (/sarcasm), she schools him. Time and time again, she beats him even when Meurem thought for sure he had her beat.\\n\\n\r\nAs the games between the two become more and more intense, Meurem grows fond of her, and she becomes the catalyst for the King's arc. He stops seeing people as livestock and starts seeing them as individuals worthy of respect. While his ultimate goal doesn't change, his emotions clearly compromise his ability to stay focused. At one point, Meurem threatens to take Komugi's arm if she loses, anticipating the fear might rattle her enough for Meurem to win. Instead, Komugi reveals that she'd rather play for her life: she only sees herself as acceptable as long as she doesn't lose. For you see, Komugi is the breadwinner for her family due to her being the World Champion of Gungi. But should she lose even once, due to the feast-or-famine nature of Gungi competition, she will become the greatest burden upon her family as she will make nothing. She would consider herself worthless garbage at that point.\\n\\n\r\nThat's a burden. A burden can be one of the most effective ways to endear a character to an audience. And that's exactly what it did. After she said that, I immediately fell in love with her character and personality, and was hoping she made it out of everything okay. \\n\\n\r\nHer symbolic presence also had a great deal of weight in making me enjoy her character so much. Komugi represents innocence (or naivete) in the face of immense danger or a time of fear. She is a shining light that leads Meurem in perhaps a better direction than the one he was initially projected.\\n\\n\r\nSo the challenge to the audience this time was this: can you respect this pathetic looking little girl? This blind, sniveling, bumbling, insecure mess of a creature? And honestly, if even one thing about her appearance were different, I don't think I would like her as much. But as is, her demeanor and looks are perfect in my eyes to support this archetype. \\n\\n\r\nAlso in tow are what I consider \"joke characters\", or characters that appear to exist basically just as a punchline. Initially I pegged Palm, Knuckle, and Shoot to fit that mold. But to my surprise, the writers chose to give depth to what would otherwise be silly one-offs. While Palm initially has a very silly and edgy appearance, she changes and becomes an important part of the plot. Shoot is initially portrayed as a \"Coward\", as the narrator comically declares him. But as the story unfolds, Shoot overcomes his cowardice and grows strong enough to challenge the much stronger Youpi. Knuckle I thought for sure was a joke character due to his ridiculous appearance and silly personality. But once again, I was wrong. He has a soft spot for dogs and animals in general (which I find very relatable) and has a very strong personality. He ended up being one of my favorite characters. The point I'm getting at is they have taken what could have been shallow, dull characters and gave depth and personality to smaller roles. Rather than just using Knuckle and Shoot as one-off Deus Ex Machina roles to further the boys' growth, the author chooses to have Gon and Killua lose to them. This is done not only to ground Gon and Killua, but also to establish Knuckle and Shoot as recurring characters. That is going out of your way as a creator and writer to subvert bad, cliched writing and replace it with something smart and driven. Frankly, it's genius.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I didn't even mention Welfin and Ikalgo. I could write two more lengthy paragraphs on them, but for the sake of brevity I'll stop here. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters get an A+.\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment-\\n\\n\r\nWhat do you think? I freaking loved Hunter x Hunter. I'll admit thought most of my enjoyment came from the Chimera ant arc. While everything up to that point was great, that arc was the one that established a firm emotional connection with me and had me hooked. I had a blast and I have a few more characters to add to my favorites list. Neferpitou, Kurapika, Komugi, Kite, and Melody are just a few names I don't think I'll be forgetting any time soon. \\n\\n\r\nHunter x Hunter succeeded in one of the most important aspects of fiction: making an emotional connection with the audience. I feel no shame in admitting I cried 10 times during Hunter x Hunter. That's 7 more times than I did during Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, a show I consider this one to be on equal footing with. Hell, I can't even talk about the Komugi and Meurem death scene without crying. No, seriously. I tried and failed while writing this review. I'm glad I watched this anime and hope it stays with me for the rest of my life.\\n\\n\r\nIf I were to grade for enjoyment, it would be an A+.\\n\\n\r\nAnd with that, I'm done talking about Hunter x Hunter. As I watched the last episode, I couldn't help but jot down a few last notes to close my review with. \\n\\n\r\nThe entire final sequence of Gon climbing the tree is symbolic. The World Tree is a metaphor for the adventure Gon has experienced up until now, and Ging at the top is a metaphor for the end of his journey. And as he meets and discusses his life with his newly found father, Ging delivers the line I'll finish with:\\n\\n\r\n\"You should enjoy the little detours. To the fullest. Because that's where you'll find the things more important than what you want.\" -Ging Freecs\\n\\n\r\nHunter x Hunter gets a 10/10.",

            "content": "Many people take a look at the childish exterior of this show and without second thought don't even give HxH a chance, but a show that managed to climb in the top lists of many sites and become the favorite anime of many users, certainly does something right that it deserves your minimum attention if nothing more.Every review more or less is a subjective experience of a series, so give me the chance to tell you why I loved this show as much as I did, and what I consider as pros, and what may be seem as cons. \r\nFirst of all I lovebattle shounen as a genre, Dragon Ball was my first cartoon (at least that's what I thought it was) at the age of 13. I've seen a lot of battle shounen and I loved almost all of them back then, but as I grew older and more experienced in anime I inevitably outgrew this genre as the writing seemed \"childish\", repetitive and too predictable so the result was that my enjoyment collapsed. What I was craving for was an anime that would entertain my intellect but at the same time would retain the charm a battle shounen can have, something that would resonate with my \"adult child\"(if that makes sense). That's when HxH 1999 was discovered and consequently HxH 2011.\\n\\n\r\nStory/Characters\\n\\n\r\nNot only this show is the charming coming of age story of Gon who embarks on an adventure to find his dad, which retains all those elements that you loved as a child, it is also a well written, structured and thought out, intelligent story that will satisfy your adult mind and feed your intellect exactly what you may be looking for. Wonderful world building, charming and unique characters with depth and development throughout the series that have their own motivations and as the show progresses prove to you that they are more than just some generic archetypes, good characterization which brings interesting and realistic interactions and dynamics between them, unpredictable storyline with jaw dropping moments, superb dialog that reflects realism and maturity, proper build up for any major event that makes you care about what happens, profound and powerful emotional moments, great comedy that isn't silly or too \"childish\" which blends well with tension,drama and action; a creative well thought out battle system which allows for strategic fights that will keep you glued to your seat, and last but not least lots and lots of fun. All that right here combined with perfect pacing makes for an entertaining and engaging story that will make marathoning HxH the easiest thing in the world, and soon enough you will be wishing it was more than just 148 episodes,even episodes with no action are engaging and have some sort of plot or character development. Of course this doesn't mean that as a battle shounen HxH is void of cliches and tropes but even if there are, how they are used in the story and executed is what makes it differ, everything makes sense and every little detail is explained explicitly or not, paying attention is required as the show is dialog heavy and many things are implied,as a result many conclusions can be drawn by association. \\n\\n\r\nThe writer seems to have general knowledge of the world; like human psyche, political and social structures, religion, world economy, history and etc... Combined with his imagination and the nature of the show the result was seven (one is a mini arc) different arcs in their genre, tone, atmosphere, length, themes and at points pacing as well. I know I said \u201cperfect pacing\u201d but that depends on the viewer if he likes the slow down pacing in some arcs. The transition between them feels smooth and logical except maybe for the Chimera Ants arc, but for the rest of them there is subtle at points and at others not so subtle foreshadowing. You will encounter some cheerful and lighthearted arcs, and some that are really dark and grim. Some may view the fact that there is no thematic continuity between arcs, or that some arcs end in an anti climatic manner as a negative aspect or as a \"flaw\", but ultimately it boils down to personal preference and nothing more, personally I like those aspects of the show because an adventure of this type and life itself isn't predictable, and you never know where the next turn might throw you and what challenges you might encounter, I prefer those realistic aspects because it reminds me a simple valuable truth, that today we are alive and tomorrow we are not, so it's all about living life at its fullest no matter where you are at.\\n\\n\r\nObviously nothing is flawless and even if for me this is the nearest thing to perfection, I'll try to point some things that might be perceived as flaws. I already mentioned the transition between arcs, so I won\u2019t expand on that. Although this adaptation is very faithful to the manga, the first chapter and the introduction of an important character to Gon and plot was cut out from the first episodes and introduced in episode 75, which made some motivations and actions \"clouded\". First episodes seem a little childish and it might take a while for the show to reel you in. The 6th arc (Chimera Ants arc) is the longest in the series and has questionably a few pacing issues and some viewers might lose interest, combined with heavy narration in the second half of the arc and different expectations from the viewers, frustration might arise and enjoyment may collapse, but for an arc that was the most ambitious arc in any shounen I've seen, a story that was far from ordinary, full of reflective ideals that were penetrating and influential, controversial opinions is the least that you should expect. So although the arc might be powerful it doesn't mean everyone will enjoy it, this again depends on your preferences. The last thing that comes to mind as a \"negative\" is the ending, it leaves some sub plots unresolved and a few questions unanswered, although it does have a satisfying ending for a manga that is on hiatus, and ultimately it works really well with the overall theme of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\\n\r\nFor a long running show the animation is very consistent, this doesn't mean that every episode is greatly animated, it just means that the budget is distributed intelligently and the episodes that needed the boost got it. The fights are really well animated and detailed, with great choreography, and the action scenes are impressive. One of the most astonishing features are the distinct facial expressions, rarely an anime captures so many raw emotions just by the expressions of the face. The colors are vibrant and generally adjust to the tone of the scene and the atmosphere of the arc really well. Character designs are unique, interesting and at some cases really weird, which makes almost all of the chars distinct and memorable.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nThis part here gets progressively better as the arcs get progressively more interesting and shift in themes, genre and tone. At the beginning arcs you might notice a misuse of sound that doesn't fit its respective scene in tone but generally the soundtrack is impressive. There are some really remarkable and memorable moments mostly in the Chimera Ant arc. OP song is the same from start to finish and the only songs that change are the ED songs. Voice actors are incredible and fit very well almost to every character except maybe for Kurapika. Jaw dropping performances can be expected from Megumi Han(Gon), Ise Mariya(Killua), Daisuke Namikawa (Hisoka), Ginga Banjou and Nagai Ichiro (as Netero).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nRarely I rewatch an anime and I've seen this 4 times already. This show has easily the most impactful moments that I'll remember forever from any anime and any media in general. Marathoning this show was as easy as breathing and when it ended I felt sick and wanted more, it was like an addiction but a very fun addiction.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\n\"The world is like a ride at an amusement park, and when you choose to go on it, you think it's real, cause that's how powerful our minds are. And the ride goes up and down and round and round; it has thrills and chills and it's very brightly colored and it's very loud and it's fun... for a while. Some people have been on the ride for a long time, and they begin to question: \"Is this real, or is this just a ride?\" And other people have remembered, and they come back to us, and they say, \"Hey - don't worry, don't be afraid - EVER - because... this is just a ride.\"  Bill Hicks\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is just a ride, a fun and powerful ride that will lead to many roads and detours, a battle shounen that will satisfy a casual viewer and a more experienced one, so give this show a chance and you might discover a detour of your life that will take you to new entertainment heights.\\n",

Yes.\r\nWhat you need to know, is that long type of anime series tend to have a slow start. Don't let that scare you off! Even without super intense fighting in the beginning, the series will catch you offguard and make you want to watch always one more episode.\r\nAs a typical shounen anime, the MC's power up throughout the series. The beautiful excecution of that is what makes HxH (2011) so much better than your average shounen/action. This series containsone of the best fight scenes ever made.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is great (Madhouse never fails, huh?) for the beautiful landscape but also for fighting scenes, characters and the way they made the show feel really alive and exciting.  The character development in this series is great. Not only do the MC's power up and strengthen their bonds as the story progressess but the side characters get also developments. \\n\\n\r\nIf you somehow haven't already seen this anime, consider starting it now! not only do you otherwise miss a great anime but you also miss in my opinion one of the most episodes in anime ever.

            "content": "The story revolves around a young boy named Gon, who wants to search for his father and find out why his father left him to become a Hunter. So he becomes a Hunter himself, finding a few friends along the way.\r\nHis friends all get their time to shine (some more than others) in a respective arc, but since Gon is the main protagonist, most of the arcs presented in this story, are revolved around his development.\r\nThe entire story felt as if it were just one huge training arc. The protagonist has never been the strongest in every arc presented. He is constantly one-upped by nearlyall of his enemies. And that's one thing I enjoy. Where the main protagonist (even though he is considered a genius/having a lot of potential) still gets constantly beat because of the huge difference in experience. And I actually enjoyed watching the training and the growth of the main characters. I absolutely hate it when they off-screen the training (usually in the form of a time-skip) just to become overpowered.\\n\\n\r\nAnd unlike most anime, instead of gaining power through random means, usually by the conventions of the plot, you MUST sacrifice something to gain power, which is very, very similar to FullMetal Alchemist.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art. The art is probably the largest gripe I have with this anime. Many people will immediately judge this anime because the two main protagonist are both children and the atmosphere in the anime looks very bright. Especially at the beginning of it. The 1999 version of the Hunter Exam was done much better and had the atmosphere similar to that of the Chimera Ant Arc. And because of all the brightness, I'd assume that's why many people were caught off-guard by the brutal and \"grim-dark\"-ness of the Chimera Ant Arc. I've had many friends, who only watch Seinen anime, immediately reject watching it because of the brightness and how Shonen-y the art was.\\n\\n\r\nSound - The sound in the first two arc of the story is very lacklustre, but the sound immediately improves ten fold when the Yorknew City arc hits, playing some opera/classical music\\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE2muDZksP4 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBq7yu8H2kI\\n\\n\r\nIt was absolutely magnificent and it stays consistent throughout the rest of the series (Starting from the Yorknew Arc), having another immediate increase in quality when the Chimera Ant Arc hits. I have no idea how so much people have a problem with this. The 1999 Sound is just as good, maybe even better though, it's all a matter of preference. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters - The characters are absolutely phenomenal. Togashi threw in so many characters, you were bound to find at least one that you liked. Nearly every single character is memorable and had their own personality. No characters were carbon copies of each other, like in many other anime. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime has a few things that could have been done better, especially the beginning, but it is absolutely amazing and you cannot watch this entire anime through without finding at least one or multiple parts that you'd think \"Oh, that was pretty cool!\" I recommend to anyone who's into story driven battle anime like FullMetal Alchemist Brotherhood. \\n\\n\r\nIf you are a One Piece or Naruto fan and watch this out of spite because people keep referring to it as the \"best shonen,\" you won't enjoy it as much and will be quick to cherry pick all the small inconsistencies (like a lot of the people referring to Episode 131 as an asspull which clearly shows how much they were paying attention to the story) If you're expecting 30 minute badly-paced fights, then you will be disappointed. This is a very story driven anime, if you are one of those people who mindlessly watch anime for the fights, then do not watch it and stay far away from it. If when you're watching this, you're expecting most of the characters to stay static (namely the main character) and be some sort of \"beacon of light\" like Naruto is in his Universe,  then do not watch this anime. Gon (the main character) has some of the most realistic personalities, unlike Naruto and Luffy, and there are times where he hurt his own friends and puts his selfish desires in front of everything else.\\n\\n\r\nGo into this, not having much expectations and you'll probably have one of the best rides watching this.\\n\\n\r\nPlease watch more than the first two arcs, because they happen to be the two of the worst of the series and do not immediately be turned off by the art.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

This is the anime that shows us how a shounen anime should be done!!!\r\nStory 10/10\r\nThe Story is amazing, the series de-constructs all the boring and repetitive shounen tropes and change it into something exciting and breath-whelming, Its different , it has variety, Each arc is fresh and it never feels repetitive , No two arcs are the same, It has its share of light arcs, and the pretty dark and gruesome ones, and when it gets dark it gets reallydark, no Nakama powers , no resurrection bullshit, the events are always unpredictable and each arc has something new to offer. \\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\nSeriously this has got to be one of the best drawings and animation I have ever seen, and to come from an ongoing series, the characters and backgrounds are drawn well, the art is consistent and some episodes are just above awesome with their drawings and animation, let's just say that a series like that is worth watching in HD more than SD , The animation is pretty smooth when it need it too.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\r\nThe voice acting is amazing, the voices are powerful and they are consistent with their characters and characteristics, the soundtrack is absolutely amazing and the variety of soundtracks helps them a lot in choosing them in the series, there are sad OSTs , epic ones, the oh shit ones , strategic ones, happy ones, you just find a variety of everything you can think of and they are amazing, I also have to applaud for the two masterpiece OST's Riot and The Last Mission.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10\\n\r\nI just have to say that this is by far one of the few anime series that actually develop every character whether it is a villain or a protagonist a companion it is or not, all the characters get developed , we all hear their line of thoughts in this death note style , the characters are not stupid, a lot of mind games are played between characters, and the characters cannot be loved or hated based on who is the strongest , but in fact they are loved for what they are and what they do. Characters develop emotionally and experience wise which is a big plus to this anime\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nthe first two episodes were not that enjoyable but when it started in episode 3 I watched a real adventure before my eyes, an adventure where you feel its dangers and you understand its risks and it's unpredictability , It's cruelty too, I just can't say more than that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 / 5 = 10\\n\r\nso it is 10/10 (Masterpiece)",

I can see how that opinion could be formed based upon the fact that one particular arc had a particularly long buildup. I, however, must encourage you strongly to watch this show, because I can guarantee that the first arc AT LEAST will catch your attention. This show left me wanting far more in its wake as well, and touched me in a way that only Fullmetal Alchemist had before. \r\n\tThe story is amazing, one of friendshipand epic adventure. If you're fond of One Piece, Naruto, Fairy Tail, and even Avatar: The Last Airbender, you will most likely fall in love with this show. It focuses on the good and bad aspects of life, and the fact that just because you're a child doesn't mean you're weak of body and mind. I particularly loved the way they brought all the characters in and out of the show at times. The creative and unique plot was quite enjoyable for me. \\n\r\n\tThe art was cartoony, but don't let that fool you. The movement was fluid and action scenes were breathtaking. I'm usually extremely picky about what art style I will and will not watch, but I made an exception for this show because I just couldn't put it down once I started. This brings me to the sound, which was also amazing. The opening sequence remained the same for all 148 episodes, which I thought was a touching tribute to the show (It made me cry at the end). The animation for the theme song is also quite good, showing off each of the four main character's personalities well. \\n\r\n\tThe characters were amazing. I fell in love with each and every one of their quirks and odd personalities. Gon's friendly and light hearted personality will make you instantly happy every time he comes on screen, and Killua's cool, suave personality will excite you for the upcoming battle. The character development was also outstanding, as each one of them had a major change to undergo. It wasn't an instant revelation, though, as the show had plenty of time to age and mold the characters into believable people. They feel sad, frustrated, angry, cheery, jealous, and any other emotion a human could possibly possess. It was the withdrawal of the characters for me that made me feel desperate for a continuation of the show. \\n\r\n\tI thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of the show, something that I find trouble with. It did not disappoint me in any way, and I hope that anyone who reads this review will find pleasure in watching it as well. It's not easy to find an amazing work of art such as this, but as an action anime lover, I can happily say that I found a new favorite show in Hunter x Hunter.",

Boy with untapped potential, goes on a journey, getting stronger in battles, etc, etc.  \r\nWhat sets this apart from most shouen battle anime is the amount of strategizing they do in these fights.   It's not the typical fight between two alpha males relying on the next power up to win the fight.  In fact, almost none of the fights in the series were between two evenly matched foes.   Almost every time, they head into a fight where they're heavily outmatched and it's only through strategies andtraps do they complete their objectives.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the story, the arcs are quite varied.  Some more entertaining than others.  But some of them are very emotional.  Some will make you question which side is really the right side.  This is not the bright shiny shouen as it seems at first, and present some dark heavy themes in it as it goes along.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, overall this was a wonderful experience!",

            "content": "\"Don't judge a book by its cover,\" they always say, and that applies to this anime.\r\n--------No spoilers---------\r\nTo be honest, before I watched this I judged this anime by its cover picture. I thought, \"Hmm... I see a lot of good comments on this, and it's popular... but it looks kiddish.\" That was my first impression. I thought it was going to be stupid or it was going to be something like One Piece. I procrastinated to watch it. Then finally I got bored and wanted to try it out, I watched two episodes. Then six, then seven... then after a month or two I gotto episode 141 and stopped watching it for about three weeks because it was so good I didn't want it to end. Then finally I forced myself to finish it and the result was crying for the fifth time. \\n\r\nIf you judge by the cover like I did, think: Why is it rated R? Well sir/ma'am, it's because there is lots of blood. I mean... not like it's raining buckets, but like as half the characters in AN opening dies in different ways. They die by being eaten, beaten to death, or just get shot or something terrible. It's not THAT bloody, I mean not like Attack on Titan bloody, but sometimes it's a bit too much.\\n\r\nI'm not saying that Hunter x Hunter always seems like it's rated R, sometimes it seems like it's rated PG 13. A lot of scenes it really cute and adorable, but sometimes... not so much. Sometimes you just want to cry your eyes out or just punch the computer/TV/phone until your hands bleed.\\n\\n\r\n------------------------\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10!\\n\r\nThis is my new favourite anime. There are many who have loved this and I am one of them. It may be long but you just have to find the time to watch it. One complaint though: It has the same opening song every episode but different opening art (for opening song) every arc. \\n\r\nRecommended:\\n\r\nI recommend this anime to people who love action/adventure anime.\\n\r\nSimilar to:\\n\r\nHunter x Hunter is similar to One Piece, Fullmetal Alchemist, and Fairy Tail, but nothing can't truly compare to the awesomeness of this anime.",

And people don't know that they're badass. Anyways, that's not the point. This anime is underrated because it's too psychological, varied, and complex for a regular shounen fan. \r\nI highly recommend this anime if you like an actual planned out anime, love FMAB,no filler episodes, an outstanding soundtrack, several amazing arcs, f***ing AMAZING character development, good quality animations, and a catchy opening.\\n\\n\r\nTo me this anime is a masterpiece.

            "content": "I remember the days when I would scroll through my Crunchyroll app, looking for good animes to watch, and I would come upon HunterXHunter. I remember examining the cover, disliking the way the show looked, and moving on without even reading the anime summary. I was missing out on so much. The only reason I'm grateful for my ignorance is because I was able to watch the whole anime all the way through without having to wait for the next episode. \r\nHunterXHunter is sorely underrated. Unless I activiely searched it up, or I became lucky, I'd never see anyone recommending it or even commenting aboutit. I never saw a trace of anyone referring to it even. This might just be from my experience, but HXH seems to have been largely ignored. But I don't feel bad for the anime itself, I feel bad for the people missing out on it. I usually try not to profligate my opinion because I know everyone has a different taste, but this is just such a well-rounded show that I feel you'd have to really try to hate it. Onto the review.\\n\\n\r\nI really understand why this anime is so underwatched. I'm talking from personal experience. Just one look at the cover and you see a generic shonen with odd-looking characters. This is the main reason I avoided it for so long. Next you see that it has 148 episodes. Immediately you think, \"That's way too long...it's just another run-on shonen...No thanks.\" And you avoid it even more. But then one day you look at the top anime lineup on MAL and you notice it is within the top five most highly rated animes. You do a double-take. Suddenly you have to watch it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then you do. And what do you find?\\n\\n\r\nAn even more generic storyline than you thought it would be. Gon is a kid who wants to become a Hunter and find his dad, he can do things other people can't and is talented, he takes stupid risks and amazes the people around him...Oh heck no. This just screams \"I'm a long-running shonen anime, the main character is destined for greatness and he's going to go out on a never-ending journey to find his father, make new friends along the way and show up everyone else around him.\" Yeah, I had the same exact thoughts. That's why after one episode I put it on hold for two months.\\n\\n\r\nBut then I read a review on MAL one day and decided to pick it up again, and what I found was something I thought I'd never find again- a masterpiece. For many many years, Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood was my all time favorite anime. But after watching HXH, I found that I couldn't decide between the two and now they are tied for first place. How did I have such a change of heart?\\n\\n\r\nOne of the things that makes this anime shine the most is its ability to destroy all of your expectations. Every time I thought I knew what was going to happen, this anime spun everything around and completely surprised me. I never quite knew what was coming next. \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I loved about this anime was its fights. No fight was boring, and more importantly, they were all filled with strategy. There were no annoying shonen fights where it basically goes like this: They encounter an enemy and go all out, trying so hard to defeat it, and the enemy is only a little scuffed up and they've \"only used 3%\" of their strength. The enemy then beats the crap out of them, and everyone seems to lose their spirit. But then they have an emotional speech about friendship/strength/love and they come up with a whole new powerful move on the spot and wipe out the enemy, who increasingly becomes more and more pathetic.\\n\\n\r\nYeah, that doesn't happen in HXH. Each battle is thought out and interesting. Also, a lot of battles are actually lost. I can't even count how many times Gon or someone else lost a fight. I remember seeing Gon laid up plenty of times, and no, he wasn't healed by the next episode, his injuries took actual time to heal. Also, people die. There is blood. Unlike Fairy tail, where I can count the number of deaths and appearances of blood on one of my hands, HXH doesn't hold back on either of those, but it doesn't go crazy on them either. (I'm not bashing oh FT, but just for the record it was one of my favorite animes until I watched HXH, then I realzied how...not amazing it was.)\\n\\n\r\nNow onto the characters. They're all awesome, even the enemies. When I try to think of an enemy I hate, I can only think of one but even then he's only really a half-enemy and its my personal opinion on the character. Honesly, they are all amazing. I don't eve have any more to say about them, I've said all I needed to.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is great. I don't really pay attention to art usually but it's very nice to look at and it's consistently good.\\n\\n\r\nI don't really pay attention to music, but a lot of it fits the mood perfectly when it plays and I enjoyed it as well.\\n\\n\r\nThis is just a little thing, but HXH only has two fillers which you can just skip.\\n\\n\r\nAnother great thing is the relationships. The relationships between the characters are enjoyable, especially between Gon and Killua. I admire how well all of the relationships are built, and they all just make you love the characters more. (Also, these same relationships are what caused me to cry on multiple occasions.)\\n\\n\r\nThis is getting lengthy so I'll just end it here. I give this show and everything in it a 10. It is a masterpiece and I have yet to find anything better than it. It may seem generic and cliche at first, but it isn't, and you won't regret watching more of it. If you watch this show and by the end of it you dislike it, I'd need to see a very detailed explanation to believe you. \\n\\n\r\nWatch this anime. I feel bad for people who haven't seen it yet.\\n",

            "content": "Hunter X Hunter (2011) is something different. Although it looks like another typical shounen it does not have most of its issues. I will now tell you why is this anime treasure among the others in same genre.\r\nWhen someone decide to watch long shounen series he probably expects few things. Firstly strong character development. Secondly awesome main story which will hold you even through the filler episodes. In the third place visualy and emotionaly strong battles. And for the last already mentioned fillers - episodes which can be funny sometimes but they only delay the main meat of the series.\r\nSo ladies and gentlemen, I presentyou Hunter X Hunter first long shounen anime I ever watched which does NOT have filler episodes. Every episode is connected to the main story line. Enlarding the character development and backstory.\\n\\n\r\nEvery episode you will watch the development of the main story and of the main protagonists and antagonists in one of 7 arcs covered by this anime.\\n\r\nSixth arc and the longest is something about 60 episodes long and its ending is the best this anime has to offers. It will give you chills , tears, laught .. simply everything. It has also very specific way of telling the story. During few 20 mins episodes there are only 2-3 minutes of the story, because it is viewed from prospectives of differents protagonists etc. But enought about spoiling. Lets talk about about the main cast.\\n\\n\r\nMain heroes and antiheroes. In Hunter X hunter it is really difficult to say who is in fact antagonist. Everyone follows their ideals and in the end you will understand their intentions and even the most hatered characters will look like humans. Story itself is developed around two little boys. Gon and Killua. Some say that this anime does not deserve chance because the main protagonists are only 12 years old. I tell you it is not a problem. They are not childish, they cannot be, or they would die, immediately. In many scenes they act more mature then the adult cast. Gon and Killua have two sidekicks Leorio and Kurapika which also gets a lot of screen time and you will enjoy their stories. In fact besides Gon it is really hard to say who is in fact the main protagonist in this anime because every important character gets his screen time and development. Even antagonists. OMG. You will love them. Especially the first one to appear - Hisoka. This \"perverted magician\" is something you will enjoy for the most time and even if his main intention is to ultimately kill our Gon.\\n\\n\r\nBattles. Even this anime uses the typical shounen sign of fighting, yelling name of your \"spell or technique\" during the clash. Especially in the second part of the series after the main heroes gain the \"spiritual power\" which is something what gives hunters their special potential. Nice thing is that main heroes arent overpowered and antagonists are especially on the beggining much stronger.\\n\\n\r\nTelling something specific about story would be waste and in fact in would be very hard regarding many arcs covered. But what you can follow is the boy who is gaining power through his journey to find his father. It sound cliche but it really isnt. Mainly because it is not the only thing which really matters, more important is the will to gain strenght in order to survive in this world. And the end. Although the manga is still ongoing the end of the anime will satisfy you, you will not want to leave this awesome world of hunters and you will look forward for new adventures which can come because the final episodes opens completely new options for story development.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion. This is a MUST WATCH 10/10. It is treasure which deserves follow up and much bigger fan base. You will enjoy wast background of the story and the world, varied characters and much more.",

            "content": "I found out about Hunter x Hunter through a 2003 issue of Shonen Jump where they showcased the first chapter in English (before I knew what it was) I first started to watch the 1999 version in 2012 and then when I finished the 1999 version at the cliffhanger point, I switched to the 2011 version for the continuation. This anime rivals Yu Yu Hakusho and I never realized it was by the same author Yoshihiro Togashi.\r\nHunter x Hunter breaks from conventions of the standard Shonen genre; Hunter has its share of Seinen esque elements and shocking situations. One of Hunter\u2019s trademark things is thatit does not focus on fighting 100% of the time when compared to other Shonens. Its focus is more on strategic tactics, and psychological aspects. The narrator does a great job at explaining and showing this. Also since almost anyone can die in this anime, it really adds a lot of Drama with the characters because it avoids cliches.\\n\\n\r\nNen is one of the main ability\u2019s in the series. Being able to manipulate your own life energy and use it as a weapon. However Nen has a strict set of rules and it has limitations. What I like is that it is not plot armor and it can only do so much; I would say it\u2019s more of a tool. I also like the classification system and different types of Nen people possess and can use.\\n\\n\r\nStory & Plot: The story starts off and takes place on Whale Island. A boy named Gon Freecs adventures out into the world to find his father from learning about his profession as a Hunter. Gon wants to find out what being a Hunter means. On his journey he meets people, makes friends, and experiences a lot of things.\\n\\n\r\nThere are 7 arcs in total for the Hunter x Hunter anime. They are all unique in every aspect, but fans will tell you that the Yorknew City Arc and the Chimera Ant Arc are fan favorites and among the greats of anime arcs.\\n\r\nCharacters: The main cast consists of 4 protagonists\\n\\n\r\nGon Freecs \u2013 Gon is a young kid who is the main protagonist of the story. He is very friendly, adventurous and determined kid. Gon also possesses inhuman senses and is very athletic and rustic. Gon is an interesting character like none other I\u2019ve ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nKillua Zoldyck \u2013 Killua is an assassin of the Zoldyck family. He is shown to be similar to Gon in his happy attitude and mischievousness. The other side of him however, can be extremely violent and bloodthirsty. He is also extremely fast and is a quick thinker. His relationship with Gon is the most intricate thing in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nKurapika \u2013 Kurapika is the sole survivor of the kurta clan. Kurapika is a very distant person and he does not open up to people easily. He is very intelligent while also being heavy on morals. Kurapika is a very distant person and does not open up easily to others. He is the friendliest in the group and has some interesting interactions with the other main three.\\n\\n\r\nLeorio Paradinight \u2013 Leorio is a guy who aspires to become a doctor to help the poor and many others. Although Leorio can be impulsive and short tempered at times, he is very trustworthy and he puts his friends first before himself and his dreams. He is often the comic relief character and he is closest to Kurapika in friendship.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation & Art: Studio Madhouse really does justice to Togashi\u2019s work. The animation is top notch and the art is always solid, colorful, and very grungy at times.\\n\\n\r\nSound & Music: The sound effects are really high quality. The music was composed by Yoshihisa Hirano. At first the music didn't click for me but after listening to the soundtracks again I have to say the music works very well.\\n\\n\r\nVoice Acting: Japanese voice acting is great; familiar voice actors in the industry are present in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: You have an intricate and detailed cast of characters, a very well written story for each arc/plot for it to flow nicely, and you have an interesting world as well. I would definitely recommend Hunter x Hunter to anyone. If you\u2019re a fan of Togashi\u2019s previous work Yu Yu Hakusho, you will definitely enjoy it.",

            "content": "Hunter x Hunter is a complete masterpiece. It's not like your typical shonen anime. I had my doubts before watching this, because I wasn't comfortable with the main character being a little boy.. I was expecting a kids show shonen type anime, but then I decided to give this anime a chance. Of course, it surprised me by how amazing it was. Let me get started with saying that it's a slow start, the first arc is the Hunter Training Exam and it's not too interesting, I highly recommend that you watch through the whole thing and finish it quickly instead of dropping the show.Hunter x Hunter is downright beautiful. Oh yeah, if you're worried with it being a kiddy-show, trust me, it's not. Let's just say there are many dark moments in H x H.\\n\\n\r\nStory - The arcs in this show are great. Well done. Unpredictable, exciting, suspenseful, beautiful. The story is wonderful. Almost every arc is different. There are arcs like \"Greed Island\", an adventurous arc with Gon and Killua, there are arcs like \"Yorknew City\", very dark and murder-filled, and masterpieces like the \"Chimera Ant\" arc.\\n\\n\r\nArt - The drawing of Hunter x Hunter is fabulous, and the animation is simply amazing. They can really bring out the emotions in the characters.\\n\\n\r\nSound - The soundtrack in ost works so well with some of the scenes. They really make the scene much more epic and exciting, amazing soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter Development - Definitely one of the best character development i've ever seen, most of the characters has an amazing back story and even the antagonists have their own stories as well. Simply amazing, each character seems like their own individual.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - Jaw-dropping, I don't know how many different anime i've enjoyed the same as Hunter x Hunter. Epic and dramatic. I was on the edge of my seat during most of the arcs, just waiting for the next episode to come out. \\n\\n\r\nHunter x Hunter is a masterpiece.",

            "content": "When it comes to an anime based on finding a lost parent, i give a usual thought of \"meh\". This storyline has been used and beaten so much it's dating Chris Brown. And to my surprise Hunter x Hunter was highly rated on MAL, so I thought heck, YOLO. Now I love the lost parent storyline with all my heart and issue a sincere apology.\r\nHunter x Hunter (2011) is a remake of the same anime of the 90s, it follows the story of Gon Freecs, an aspiring Hunter who wants to find his father, who too is a hunter. Gon teams up with Killua, andwith added help from Kurapika and Leorio become hunters to achieve their own goal.\\n\\n\r\nWith regards to the story, as previously stated, this anime has a bread and butter objective, to find Gon's dad. As it's a shounen anime, the usual themes of friendship, perseverance, comedy and not mention epic fighting are included, as well as being relationship driven in areas. Furthermore, it's separated into (according to it's own wiki) 7 arcs, but primarily it's 6 that's the main focus. 5 of those 6 arcs have the main objective weaved inside them, making sure each arc has a main purpose. Although it seems simple, many anime's over 100+ episodes loose its focus on that matter. The atmosphere starts to change within each arc from suspense in the Hunter exam arc, to a thriller in the York-New auction arc and to a have a detailed analysis on the theory of evolution in the Chimera Ant arc.  Also, plot lines can change from character driven to action packed. Training is constantly prevalent in the show, with each character trying to increase their strength regularly. Strategic fights can be strenuously complicated, similar to a game of chess in how the characters defeat their opponent. What's best about that is that they keep it entertaining by reaching a middle ground between epic and calculated. But there's a catch. The main characters don't win every fight, in fact, the lose many times. This therefore adds more of an emphasis for training to become better.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, Hunter x Hunter does come with its flaws. For example, this is a reboot of the 90s Hunter x Hunter, this lead to a whole new cast being made, which could anger those who liked the older voice acting. Furthermore, it took 2 less episodes for the Hunter exam arc to start in this version than the previous one, so some dialogue had been cut out. Furthermore, some build up can be misconstrued as stalling for time, making it very boring. However, when the build up is fine right, it will make the experience of watching it that much better.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation, the rebooted show is definitely no slouch. The sharp graphics are certainly nice on the eye, and fighting animations are very much fluid. The character models themselves are similar to it's predecessor, but nicer on the eye. Gon's usually stereotypical German youth outfit is still a dazzling green as usual. All in all, the detail is very good.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the characters of Hunter x Hunter, there's only 2 characters to talk about. Gon and Killua's relationship is very much like the ying and yang complex, with each character being 2 sides to the same coin. Killua's more mature, whereas Gon is more childish and blunt in his ways. Although it can look simple, each character does contain a dark side to them, even though it isn't a true representative of their true personality. Overall, the relationship is very much like a loving brotherly relationship. In terms of character development, we see distinct attitudes to the two characters and a clear view of how the characters are based on the past. Furthermore, the many episodes also show distinct contrasts in comparison to the earlier episodes as to how the characters develop.\\n\\n\r\nWith regards to Kurapika and Leorio, each have similar traits to Gon and Killua, but unfortunately haven't received as much screen time,  but the screen time they were given showed their personalities well. \\n\\n\r\nWith regards to music, I'm not a massive fan of the opening and ending songs, not many have tickled my fancy as stunning moving pieces of music. The OST however does get a thumbs up, as not only can it be lighthearted, but it can easily intensify the atmosphere in thriller and suspense moments.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, for an anime which ended on an incredibly high note, I hope I see another series of Hunter x Hunter in the coming years. I do recommend this to those who want to see Shounen at its best.\\n",

            "content": "(6.0/10) \r\nHunter X Hunter is a flawed show that's trying incredibly hard to break through the endless loop of sameness that plagues its genre. \r\nShounen-action anime has always been something that's light. Its also something that's made to last. From shows like Bleach to One Piece to FMA to Hunter X Hunter, these shows almost never stop before the sixty episode mark. \r\nThis is mainly due to their incessant need to stay on air. Its very blatant that a lot of these shows have a very prolonged production schedule that seems to string the entire show along. This means that these shows are almost flawedby nature. When you have an endless stream of consciousness, you tend to babble. \\n\\n\r\nI know this first-hand, too. I tend to talk way too much about a topic I know i can be concise about. I just kind of repeat the same shit in a slightly different way and only after i'm done repeating it do I realize that i've repeated myself. Its an awkward flaw to have, especially since I love talking about things i'm passionate about, positively or negatively. So i tend to talk way too mucha bout a topic i know I can be concise about. I just kind of repeat the same shit in a somewhat different way... Well, you see what I mean. \\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\\n\r\nI'm a fan of things that try to be out there. I love shows that make that creative leap into the realm of the unknown... so it should come as no surprise that i'm simply not a fan of Shounen-action shows. They're always so drawn out. They always beat a dead horse until its nothing but mashed meat. They always pretend not to have filler by injecting plot into otherwise filler episodes, and that in itself is annoying. Lastly, they almost always have shit animation. \\n\\n\r\nEven shows like FMA:Brotherhood ended up feeling dragged out to me. I ended up being very disenchanted with a story that just goes too far. The stakes became too high, the entire scenario ended up being really dumb and over-the-top in the worst way possible. That defines Shounen for me. \\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\\n\r\nI don't think you'll be surprised to hear that I think HunterXHunter is massively overrated. I think that just about every aspect of it isn't as good as I see people claim it is. However, I do think that it does its best to separate itself from the onslaught of shit-Shounen out there. If anything, its the most entertaining one I've seen. \\n\\n\r\nMuch like the show, i'll be splitting my review into six parts, with a short conclusion to wrap things up. So, without further wait, lets get into it. \\n\\n\r\n________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[PART 1] : The Shounen Exams \\n\\n\\n\r\nWhen comparing this show to other shounen-action anime I try to think back to every single episode. This is naturally hard since there are a whopping 148 episodes. But nevertheless, I try. \\n\\n\r\nMuch like a lot of Shounen, HunterXHunter plays like a stream of conscious. The breathing breaks are the light hearted episodes and the story-driven episodes are the rambling. Which, for the most part, is fairly cohesive. \\n\\n\r\nOccasionally the story gets a bit too muddled with its own rules, as the creator of the manga seems to have a hard-on for them. The amount of information overload through undramatic exposition is pretty incredible in this show. \\n\\n\r\nI felt like every other scene is just a certain character explaining a new rule or a new way to implement a previously established rule. If you think you'll get away with learning the rules from the beginning of the show, I have bad news. Literally every arc has a brand new set of rules.\\n\\n\r\nFrom an MMO-esq card game to learning how to use your inner force, everything has names and abilities and ways to establish them. I feel like all of them are impressively crafted but in the end it feels as though it's something to study rather than to watch. \\n\\n\r\nThey are almost never delivered in an engaging way and these exposition scenes quickly lose you as a viewer.\\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\nThat's the sad thing about most Shounen. A lot of them make their way to the action, but the actual way they end up going is animation-saving dialogue scenes that do little to establish characters. And when they DO establish characters its almost always through wrestler-esq jobbing or blatant exposition. \\n\\n\r\nAnd that's just part one of these Shounen exams. Since Hunter X Hunter seems to eager to check every single marker off the \"Shounen Cliches list\". But that doesn't mean it doesn't do them well, for the most part. \\n\\n\r\nThese exposition scenes are almost always backed by engaging, if not overused, scores. As well as at least some character banter that makes it seem like you aren't being lectured in a college classroom. \\n\\n\r\nThis goes for fights as well. Each one is about strategy, and while that may be engaging for some, I found myself horribly disinterested in a lot of them. Thankfully most fights don't last for more than an episode, but when the fight is dragged out, I found myself zoning out. \\n\\n\r\nThe issue the writer has to juggle with is the idea of maintaining tension while still dragging the show through the exposition puddle every half a second. Even in the shows more memorable fight scenes, its Shounen roots show and I find myself relaxed instead of gripping the edges of my seat. \\n\\n\r\nI think its more of a personal taste...But if there was a Shounen-cliche exam, this show would pass with flying colors. Here's your Shounen-card, HxH, use it well. \\n\\n\r\n_______________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[PART 2] : The Shounen Family \\n\\n\\n\r\nNow that the show is settled comfortably in its Shounen roots, lets talk about how it tries to break free. In the middle of this shows teen-boy demographic I constantly see a show that's just one or two steps away from becoming fully engaging. \\n\\n\r\nThrough the shows six arcs, it developed solidly. Starting as a mostly innocent fun romp, its slow decent into darker storytelling was something that intrigued me. However, I never felt like they went \"whole hog\" with it. Apart from very specific scenes every so often, I hardly ever felt surprised with this show.\\n\\n\r\nThis is mainly due to it inheriting a lot of negative traits from its Shounen parents. Those traits being Deus Ex Machina, and as I've said before, a mass amount of exposited information... constantly. \\n\\n\r\nThe show itself has two goals, develop the relationship between Gon and Killua, the shows protagonists, and make its merry way to the next battle. While the relationship between Gon and Killua never feels forced, I always felt like it was one step away from becoming something special. \\n\\n\r\nFor every entertaining piece of character building we got an extremely cheese-filled edgy sequence. Or one of those horrendous panning shots of the characters face as he says something edgy. Its cheese, and its not funny cheese. its the kind of cheese that's kind of moldy that smells bad, not the kind you want to sprinkle over your beef stroganoff. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, their relationship does end up playing as the crux of the show, even if the show does do the smart decision of not making them major players in a lot of these arcs. Apart from one arc in the show, Gon and Killua always felt like helpers, rather than leaders. This was a conscious decision by the creator to make the universe feel constantly more dangerous as their eyes open to new possibilities with their power.\\n\\n\r\nApart from one scene in particular, the show stays true to that and I appreciated this greatly. It had a certain honesty to it. \\n\\n\r\n__________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Part 3] : Shounen Arena \\n\\n\\n\r\nSo lets talk about how this show stacks up when compared to its partners like FMA. Well, personally, i enjoyed it a decent amount more than FMA. For one, the tone of HxH felt more engaging. \\n\\n\r\nWhile FMA usually kept its tone serious apart from the very obvious \"joke\" scenes, where the failed attempt of humor became overbearing. HxH does the smart thing and makes the humor feel slightly (and I mean very slightly) more natural. A lot of the jokes aren't really drawn at the characters expense. \\n\\n\r\nWith that, the shows entire tonal shift towards the latter half, with it becoming more violent and heartbreaking, works fairly well. Its always interesting to see something so happy go so wrong. \\n\\n\r\nI had a very \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\" vibe with the shows first two arcs. This is great news, since Avatar is one of my favorite shows of all time. The light hearted nature combined with the less-lighthearted thematic elements made for a nice little juxtaposition. \\n\\n\r\nWhile I won't compare it to the likes of Attack on Titan, since that show is hardly finished, I'll say that HxH does Shounen in what is most likely the most engaging possible way. It stays true to the cliches whilst enhancing the parts it can make better. \\n\\n\r\nFor example, its willingness to have these characters get separated, or stay off-screen, is a change that I enjoyed. The cast in this show is gargantuan but they never feel forced. This leads me to the best part of the show. \\n\\n\r\n________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[PART 4] : An Auction for Design \\n\\n\\n\r\nThis shows best quality is its character design. While the animation itself is fairly lacking due to the constant use of re-used footage as well as still-images to fill time and save budget, the character designs shine. \\n\\n\r\nI can't think of a single character in this show that wasn't memorable to some extent. Even the smaller characters that ended up being killed soon after their introduction had so much creativity put behind them, you couldn't guess that they wouldn't be major players. \\n\\n\r\nIn fact, the most entertaining aspect of the show was the unexpected change that certain characters were introduced only to die... and you realizing that, that amazing character design had you completely fooled!\\n\\n\r\nEvery character also has a place in the shows extensive rule-book of power. Each character does feel like a player. That's great. \\n\\n\r\nWhether its the creepy, yet bad-ass joker-esq clown, Hisoka, or Killua's entire family, these players are constantly something to look out for. This show does a marvelous job with making these unique characters stand out and I never found myself forgetting who someone was. That's a great feat for show that has seemingly hundreds of characters! \\n\\n\r\n___________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[PART 5] : Greedy Episodes\\n\\n\\n\r\nEvery arc feels like it has progression. This keeps building and building until the shows final arc. I'm not counting the very final twelve episodes as a whole arc since I felt as though they were there to create a conclusion rather than a continuation, even if the manga isn't done. \\n\\n\r\nBefore I get into the final arc, I want to discuss a shounen anime's ability to drag. Whether its something like Dragonball Z or even a much shorter show like Attack on Titan. Shounen has this genre cliche of dragging out stories to fit time slots.\\n\\n\r\nHunter X Hunter felt as though it was breaking that mold by making every arc feel as though its breezy and fast. Even the Greed Island arc, which had an entirely new video game rule-set in place felt quicker than I expected. It played with its sillier roots well and the conclusion of the arc, while a bit obvious, served as a nice segway into the next one. \\n\\n\r\nThis was the case for most of the shows arcs, too. Each one was backed by catchy toons, especially the Yorknew Auction arc which has my favorite ending theme to any anime i've seen thus far. They're also backed by a lot of characters and a constant feeling of escalating power. \\n\\n\r\nThis is where the show struggles. I feel like just like the dragging cliche, a Shounen's incapability to escape rising action is plaguing the entire genre.\\n\\n\r\nBy rising action I mean the base idea of any storytelling. To ramp up the story by raising consequences and stakes to create a tenser environment. This show, along with its shounen family, don't understand when too far is too far. \\n\\n\r\nThis shows with its character introductions. By introductions I mean two possible ways a character can be introduced. \\n\\n\r\n1.) They walk in and one of our characters talk about how \"their aura is the strongest they've ever seen, they are so scary!\" And that gets repeated a few hundred times. \\n\\n\r\n2.) They job. By job, I mean when a previously established powerful characters gets his/her ass swiftly beaten by this new character. This happens to establish the fact that this new character is a level above anything they expected!\\n\\n\r\nWhile number two is a viable way to approach an introduction once or twice... I felt as though this is how the show introduced almost every character. When it wasn't number two, it was number one, which is even worse. \\n\\n\r\nEvery character felt like the show was trying hard to ratchet up the stakes and at one point it just became too much. The show hit its diminishing returns and it looped back and all this energy the show has spent making this character seem cool and bad-ass was thrown back in its face. It became a cheesy mess. \\n\\n\r\nFMA:Brotherhood did this with its absolutely hilarious shark-jumping finale that was so \"out there\" and overblown that I was laughing at it. It was dumb. HxH does this too at one point. It really puts a damper on the whole thing and it makes you realize that you are in fact watching a power fantasy for a kid, rather than a show just focused on being a good show. \\n\\n\r\nMind you I'm not against kids shows. I believe every piece of entertainment can be amazing. Its just how it breaks free of a lot of cliches that plague it. As well as the amount of effort and time the creators invest into making it engaging and unique for everyone. \\n\\n\r\n_______________________________\\n\\n\r\n[PART 6]: An Ant in a Parade \\n\\n\\n\r\nI promised that i'll talk about this shows final arc. I'll keep it relatively spoiler free, only mentioning character names and one aspect of the story. The Chimera Ant arc is the shows longest arc. It spans upwards of sixty episodes and presents a completely new world for the characters in this show to play with.\\n\\n\r\nNew and more powerful players are introduced again, and new rules are established. Thankfully the rules are more simple this time. The characters need to stop an invasion. \\n\\n\r\nWith that in mind, I was digging the arcs slower pace as well as its focus on developing the main characters. It felt like a slow burn that I was actually enjoying. The show became darker and the themes became more mature. The political commentary was a little on-the-nose, but the creator of the show really does demonstrate how he has a lot of knowledge on a lot of things. \\n\\n\r\nThis enjoyable arc which I, at the time, was called \"The show coming into its own\", also introduced my favorite character. The King. A sympathetic villain that became the shows diamond in the rough. A seemingly horrible being that goes through a personality crisis.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, this is where the show stops. On literally the 100th episode of the show. Our protagonists launch an attack on the invaders and here we get thirty five.... THIRTY FIVE episodes of nonstop fighting. \\n\\n\r\nAnd while that may sound cool to someone, let me reiterate. ELEVEN HOURS of Shounen action. This means we get re-used footage, still images, and incredibly cheesy moments for eleven fucking hours. Apart from a highlight or two, these thirty-five episodes were damn near unbearable. \\n\\n\r\nEverything was dragged out to a point of unbelievably, every character given enough cheese to fill up a... cheese... factory. And worst of all, it was BORING. Every piece of dialogue was perfunctory. Every emotional breakthrough was so long that halfway through you just stop caring and hope that they move on. Every second of action was prefaced with five minutes of exposition regarding a characters power. I can't be the only one who thinks that explaining your power to the villain is fucking stupid. \\n\\n\r\nWhile this arc has an absolutely remarkable ending. An ending that I think was so good and so heartbreaking that I felt like this show didn't deserve it. But for all the sadness I was feeling, a feeling of anger crept over my anime-fueled mind. \\n\\n\r\nThe reason the ending was so good was because of The King and his relationship with another character. This character was given five episodes of screentime. Five. Five. Five fucking episodes. FIVE. \\n\\n\r\nThey gave a stupid fucking invasion THIRTY FIVE episodes, yet the best part of the show, the one part of the show that I WANTED to see more of they cut short. This character was the reason The King became such a great character and this character was totally sidelined for the invasion. \\n\\n\r\nThis infuriated me. I'm even angry thinking about it. Nothing is more angering than seeing a show wash away its potential due to its dumb focus. This is the pinnacle of that. \\n\\n\r\nBut even with this massively squandered potential, even if that character only got five episodes to shine, and even if that characters prolonged presence could've made this ending EVEN BETTER, it was still good. \\n\\n\r\nThat just goes to show you how good it could've possibly been... but I digress. The show has to stay within its Shounen family, for better... but mostly for worse. \\n\\n\r\n______________________________\\n\\n\r\n[CONCLUSION] : The Shounen Election \\n\\n\\n\r\nIf you can't tell already, this show caused a pretty mixed reaction from me. On one hand we had beautifully done character designs, but on the other, we had mostly stilted and meandering animation. On one hand we had a few standout characters, on the other hand we had them bogged down by fights. On one hand we had Gon and Killua play realistic roles, on the other hand we had dramatic escalation to the extreme. \\n\\n\r\nIts mixed, but even if it is, I will say that I do not regret watching that. Even if I do honestly believe the show's story could've been told better in half its run-time, I still enjoyed it. \\n\\n\r\nFor as frustrated as it made me, by the time the final episodes credits rolled I felt like I went on a journey in a world full of journeys. I felt like I saw enough character progression. I felt like there can be infinitely more stories to tell. I even felt a hint of sadness from the knowledge that I may never see these character again. \\n\\n\r\nFor everything that this show put me through, I appreciate it. Its a show stuck in an infinite loop. A show that tries so very hard to break free of a lot of cliches that plague its genre. \\n\\n\r\nMuch like someone drowning in the water, the show tried its best to kick its way to the surface and break through to yell and wave, \"Hey, look at me!\" In a sea of stilted Shounen-action anime, its there trying to get noticed. \\n\\n\r\nI think it just might have been. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Hunter x hunter is a shounen that many overestimate, but does not mean that this shounen is bad, just overrated. And I agree that this is one of the best shounens, but I will never agree that this is an excellent work or a deconstruction of shounen, because most of it is the typical shounen with training bows, exams, tournaments and simple 2D characters, but well characterized. Other than this shounen there are only TWO good bows. It's not a very innovative shounen.\r\nExam arc: Typical exam arc. What I like about this bow is how you present your world and your characters, you can easilyenjoy the characters for being charismatic, and having fun interactions. But the problem with this bow is that it has no tension, it's short and that's it. Many characters die in this bow, but gon and killua do not care about any death and that's all bow. At least the bow is fun, but again, it has no tension: 5/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nZoldyck family bow: This bow is quite short and only serves to know more about the killua, but we do not know much about him. This bow has absolutely nothing interesting, and is forgettable so short. And this is another arc that does not have much tension, and with a meh fight so short: 5/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nTournament bow: Remember when I said that hunter x hunter was not a very innovative series? this bow proves my point even more. It is the typical tournament arc without any tension. At least there are some fun and strategic fights, such as gon and hisoka, the best anime fight, but again, it's just a generic tournament arc: 5/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nBow yorki shin: One of the best anime bows. A more psychological and intriguing arc with a pretty decent tension. This is an arc in which he focuses on kurapika, on his revenge. In this arc a fairly decent development to the kurapika, and has a bit of strategic fights. It is not an arc with very complex themes, but rather it is an intriguing and exciting arc: 7/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nBow greed island: An extremely uninteresting arc about fetching cards in a game, and that's all. A plot full of random powers, zero character development, zero tension and with bad shit villains. Totally forgettable: 3/10\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nChimera Arch Ants: The best bow of all, and one of the best battle shounen arches in history. This bow is simply amazing. The arc is quite philosophical, full of mind games, strategic battles and full of tension. Even the villain of this bow is complex. The bow has up a good pace and is the longest of all. And the end of this bow is really exciting, without doubt, the best bow of all, and one of the best of shounen. 9/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nBow of choice: Nothing much this bow, this is again another bow without tension, with absolutely nothing interesting. 5/10\\n\\n\r\nAnd this is all about hunter x hunter. I do not understand why they consider this shounen excellent. The story is built with bows like any shounen, and sadly most are Medievers with only two really good bows. and is incomplete. But other than that, it's a pretty ok shounen, modest and fun, but that's pretty overrated. That is all",

All the arcs in the series are linked to each other\r\n2. It does not portray the main character as the strongest\r\n3. The story does not focus only on the main character \r\n4. Everything that happens makes perfect sense \r\nStill, I wonder, why is it placed at the sixth rank? I consider it even better than Fullmetal Alchemist:Brotherhood.

            "content": "I know I'm a little late to the party here, but I have just recently finished the Hunter X Hunter 2011 anime. At first I went into this show expecting your typical long-running Shounen Jump series, but let me say now that I have never been happier to be so wrong.\r\nWhere do I even begin with this amazing show? There are so many different aspects to it that all deserve their own individual praise. However, I will try to keep this review short and to the point.\r\nThe story follows a young boy named Gon, who's goal is to go out and find his father, wholeft him shortly after he was born to become a Hunter. Gon believes that if he can follow in his father's footsteps by also becoming a Hunter, he would have a higher chance of seeing him. In the beginning, the show presents itself as somewhat lighthearted and joyful, but don't be fooled. As the story progresses, it becomes signicantly more and more darker and grittier, even to the point where you'll question if this is even still a shounen.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, in my opinion, are the show's strong point. Each individual person has solid, realistic, and believable personalities that really showcase what kind of character they truly are. The four main protagonists are some of the most easily likeable and relatable protagonists I have ever seen in ANY anime, not just shounen. It's definetly hard to not get attached to them. There is no lack of character development either, no character will be the same by the time you finish the last episode. I would dive deeper into this aspect, but that would require spoiler talk.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as animation, art, and sound quality go, they're as amazing as you would expect of an anime like this. More than half of the time, the animation is perfectly fluent, though it is never an eyesore. The art style definitely varies throughout the show, going from \"amazing\" to \"meh.\" In no way is it ever terrible though. However, something that does remain brilliant  throughout the entirety of the show is the soundtrack, which kicks ass!!! The opening song is immediately catchy from the first time you hear it, and the fact that its the only one the show  has gives it a sense of identity. You know that this is THE theme song for Hunter X Hunter. The instrumental themes and orchestrated pieces that play during the show are where its really at though. I could literally gush over the OST for days straight, and here's why. Each theme is perfectly crafted to tug at every kind of emotion within the viewer. They are placed at the perfect moments in the show that they were made for, and create massive, unique impacts on the audience, especially during more emotional and intense moments. Happy moments become joyful, exciting moments become exhilarating, and sad/emotional moments become beautiful and heart breaking. There's not much more to say really, its good stuff.\\n\\n\r\nOne more thing I want to point out before I come to my conclusion, is the voice acting. As of the time this review was made, this show does not yet have an English Dub, so naturally, I will be discussing the Japanese voice acting, which is incredible. Every character has perfectly fitting voices to acompany them, and their performances are all outstanding. Particually the voice actress for Gon in a certain point in the show you will surely recognize if you do decide to watch this near-masterpiece of a series.\\n\\n\r\nI could continue to ramble on and on about how much I love this anime, but I don't want to take up anymore of your time. If you've watched it, you know exactly what I'm talking about. If you haven't, then what the hell are you doing?! Go watch it right now! I can guarantee you will not regret it.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 9.75/10\\n",

            "content": "Have you ever dreamt about doing something completely unorthodox and new, something that would carry with itself many delightful situations and beautiful memories, a certain decision that would make you encounter many people, learn about different cultures or even change your life, make yourself discover new things about yourself or the world around you? Many people from different times, places, carrying different beliefs or cultures are bounded with one burning and adventurous desire that ultimately defines their audacious nature \u2013 to Discover. The title Hunters are people driven by that uncontrolled passion, to the point, where they are ready to leave their previous jobs andlives behind to fulfill their ambitions. Hence, the Hunter\u2019s license opens the door for many different jobs, inaccessible places and opportunities. It\u2019s a prestigious title, that carries with itself strenght, flair and it\u2019s treacherous temper, to the point where many people are ready to put their life on stake and gather to choose the most matched and worthy of calling himself as a Hunter. There can be many reasons: lust, money, ambition, or simple desire \u2013 to discover. Neither one of them drives the protagonist of the story. 12 years old Gon Freecs believes there must be a reason for his father leaving him to live as a Hunter, other than just being a douchebag. Hence, his adventure to find him and discover the harsh world, by becoming a Hunter begins with a big decision that follows every discovery.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSounds mediocre, right? Can\u2019t blame for that. The term of \u201cAdventure\u201d is mainly overused in the various forms of popculture and media taking away it\u2019s appeal and making it sound average. We\u2019ve all seen stories with that main word on stake \u2013 primarly in shows aimed to younger viewers - following the same and frequently seen tropes, making unable to surprise the viewer anymore. How a piece with so weakly presented and unoriginal premise of the story be so acclaimed and loved by both critics and fans, to the point where experienced viewers of the anime medium are surprised with cleverness of the story and place it among their most favourite shows? The main reason behind that is how the story is being executed during it\u2019s airing and the powerful usage of cunning writing of Yoshihiro Togashi visible as the show progreses.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNearly all shounens in anime history are basing on clich\u00e9 formulas and tropes, predictable action and unimaginative plot completely withdrawing it\u2019s charm to eventually become tedious and uncaptivating. As a matter of fact Hunter x Hunter breaks and deconstructs every formula we got used to in the genre, being the superiorance of main protagonist or clich\u00e9 character interactions, creating something extremely charming, making it something more than just a shounen anime. It\u2019s visible where the show begin to split the moral lines between protagonists and antagonists. It\u2019s normal for shounen \u201cbad guys\u201d to soften and understand their mistake, eventually teaming with the \u201cgood guys\u201d, Hunter x Hunter however, goes further, fleshing out it\u2019s villains not in a way we\u2019re used to in fiction, forcing the audience to reconsider their measurement of good and evil ultimately making the viewer unsure of righteousness of the \"good side\u201d.\\n\\n\\n\r\nPerfectly balancing between the main goal of the story and the subsidiary plots, the show slowly creates a bigger picture with them, without losing the sight from the goal, as it quickly takes place in One Piece. Fluently portraying new fleshed out characters to the story, pushing the plot forward, while constantly keeping the cunning and intelligent narrative, portraying creative and and imaginative outcomes for characters\u2019 actions, presents unconventional worldbuilding adding lots of exoticity to the modern civilization and the nature, with more government authority visible, introducing the most creative and set out power system ever created, giving limitless options and infinite usage of it not only in the show, but also being a nice food-for-imagination for those dedicated enough to invent something on their own. It is not afraid to show the main characters fail or place them in extreme situations, when winning isn\u2019t always solving the problem and battles becoming more of psychological contests than rumbling, when using strategy in a crafty way and outsmarting your enemy is what means victory \u2013 which leads to a question if the raw power the only measurement of strenght, or can it also be found in many different aspects in life? - hence making the encounters even more tense, as the show constantly keeps it\u2019s best cards in hiding, creating a false ensure of safety, completely overturning the viewers expectations and eventually leaving the viewer speechless with the final outcome. \\n\\n\\n\r\nHunter x Hunter: 2011, while not carrying much artistic values, nor revolutionizng the medium is still a profound story delving from cheerful plot to powerful analysis of humanity, strategy contests and ponderings about morality and human decisions, and is the testimony of Yoshihiro Togashi\u2019s creativity. It sets standards not only for the shounen genre, while being one of the most entertaining shows, always staying unpredictable and cunning, making it easy to marathon it and keeping top-notch production values despite of it\u2019s length, which is the very evidence of Madhouse workmanship. Nonethless it\u2019s a flawed work. The fact that the original source has not ended doesn\u2019t help with the fact that author\u2019s writing bases on not fully explaining or fleshing out some of the themes or leaving questions unanswered giving the author a bigger field to write the story in the future, while judging the anime adaptation alone it may appeal to be nothing more than just a plot hole. Even though the story still continues in the manga, the show beautifully ends leaving the viewer with a bittersweet taste as if it was the real ending of the story.\\n\\n\\n\r\nA certain work of fiction \u2013 while giving some sort of message - may therapeutically resonate with you or your current situation, giving you more positive outlook on certain circumstances. That has been the case with Hunter x Hunter. Telling a story of optimism and persistence - as shounen anime usually used to do \u2013 Hunter x Hunter highly encourages to aim bigger, but in the most reliable way i've ever encountered in anime, not giving a naive perspective of being the center of the world, but still not losing the child inside you despite of your age and seeking what drives you to become passionate, which at the end of it all gives such an obvious message (when in the beginning of the story seemed to set off unappealing) that turns around the main theme of the show. It tells how vast the world and it\u2019s not logical to naturally understand it all, while giving that microscopic feeling of having infinitely larger amount of options and capabilities than what it appears to be at first, having a big amount of time to enjoy getting from one point to another. It wouldn\u2019t necessarily matter how prestigious your title or degree is or how much money you earn, but how much experience and knowledge you received along the way and how much passion drove you to ultimately become like this. There is much to see and do despite our mistakes and hardships we endure along the way, the journey is ultimately what shape the very person you become, which is why Hunter x Hunter is so meaningful. If you haven\u2019t watched this enormously large show, consisting of 148 episodes, don\u2019t be hesitating to check it \u2013 not to ultimately finish it and get rid of it, but to enjoy what is between the end of it, because that is where Hunter x Hunter truly shine.",

            "content": "Hunter x Hunter is a long running shounen series written by Togashi Yoshihiro. You may know him as the author of Yu Yu Hakusho and the husband of Takeuchi Naoko, the writer of Sailor Moon. The still ongoing manga has gotten several anime adaptations. One from '99- '01, a thirty episode OVA from '02-'04 and a Madhouse series that started airing in 2011 and ran until 2014. The Madhouse series is the one we'll be looking at today. I did like Yu Yu Hakusho well enough, so let's see how this one compares.\r\nStory:\r\nOur narrative is set in a world where an elite group of huntershas a lot of fame, prestige and performs dangerous tasks. Each year there's an exam to determine what young blood will be allowed to join the Hunter's organisation. We follow twelve year old Gon Freecss, son of a famous hunter, who's preparing to take the exam and follow in his father's footsteps. And, since this is a long shounen action series, after that arc ends we have a good half dozen more.\\n\\n\r\nLet's begin, as I usually do, with the negatives about the story. The biggest flaw is the \u201cromance\u201d element. No, it's not actual romance but that's the quickest way to succinctly describe it before going into the details. Gon and his equally young friend, Killua, attract a lot of attention from older characters. There are multiple guys who seem to get sexually aroused from battle who develop something of a fixation on the two of them and there's a woman in her twenties who forces Gon to go on a date with her. Now, to the series' credit these blatant paedophiles are shown as, at best, having dark personalities even if they're technically allied with the heroic group. So, at least there's some acknowledgement that what they're doing is not all right. But it's still pretty bloody creepy to have that level of sexual fixation directed at twelve year olds. Especially since no one in the series seems to ever acknowledge the issue with it. The series also does, like every other long shounen action anime I've seen, have its share of filler. Although it's probably the least egregious offender I've seen in that regard. At least in terms of 100+ episode action anime.\\n\\n\r\nLet's move on to the praise. There are a lot of good things about this series. First off, it does subvert a lot of the traditional shounen tropes. Gon isn't the ultimate, most powerful person of all who comes in after his friends get their anuses torn open and just cleans up. We see a lot of stronger characters and some who are easily on the same level with him. He frequently isn't even the one who will finish a battle. He'll make definite contributions, but he won't be the key to everything working. Which gives the other characters a reason to be there beyond acting as fodder. The series is also good about setting up scenarios that, in any other action series, would end in a very particular way and then ending them in a different way that works better with the narrative. There's a clear Dragonball inspiration which the series uses well by taking certain concepts and putting its own unique spin on them. Remember Goku's Janken attack? Well, Gon has his own Janken inspired attack but his is different and stays relevant. Killua also gets a technique that's visually similar to a super saiyajin and the main antagonist of the chimera ant arc absorbs people to grow stronger, rather like Cell but, aside from that, the two villains aren't very alike. Our heroes find a teacher who looks at dirty magazines, like Roshi, but never harasses anyone and is just a far stronger character. I actually like her a lot. I've seen enough series that are blatant rip-offs (The Law of Ueki) and series that just verbatim follow cliches, that it's impressive when you find one like this that wears its inspiration clearly but also is its own unique entity.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of the strength of the arcs, they range from decent to excellent. The chimera ant arc is definitely the strongest, with a lot of development for the antagonists, a story that really builds on the prior events of the series, it has the most tragic, heart-wrenching scene I've seen in a while & it opens up quite a few possibilities for future events. The Greed Island arc, in contrast, is the weakest. It's the only arc that's just decent. It has its strong suits like Biscuit Kreuger, some very inventive action sequences, allowing us to see certain characters in a new light and Biscuit Kreuger. It also drags more than anything else in the series, features the least interesting antagonists and it's the arc that plays a lot of shounen tropes the safe and predictable way. Which gets a bit dull.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nIn general, I really like the cast in this series. I don't know why we need paedophile characters. They seem completely unnecessary. I also find Leorio a bit insufferable. The dude basically only succeeds at anything because the people around him prop him up and he's just a total swine. Although, I can't really fault the series for his writing since he does have verisimilitude. I've known people who were very much like that and I couldn't stand them either. The antagonist writing is largely well done. All of the antagonists in this have some redeeming qualities. Even the Greed Island antagonists have this sense of camaraderie among them. Which might not be much but it's something. There isn't a single character in this series who's devoid of verisimilitude.\\n\\n\r\nI can't go over every single character in great detail, so I'll just mention some of the major ones. Gon and Killua are our main boys, playing a major role in everything. In some ways, Gon seems like the dumb but good-natured shounen protagonist but it becomes clear, very quickly, that he's not stupid. He's na\u00efve because he's twelve and has spent most of his life on a small island. He's also highly observant and can be very cunning when he has a strong grasp of a situation. Killua initially seems like the character who has a dark past and that's going to be the excuse for everything they do. However, he quickly distinguishes himself from that character type by being quite cheerful instead of dark and brooding. He also distinguishes himself through his strong friendship and loyalty towards Gon. Usually that character is established as a rival for the main hero who really wants to be stronger than them and will never admit to liking them. As the series progresses, he also starts to get a lot more of a conscience. He's still pragmatic about killing when the situation calls for it, but he focuses a lot more on protecting others. Especially Gon and his little sister who shows up towards the end.\\n\\n\r\nAnother character I want to talk about is Komugi. She is the character who really solidifies the chimera ant arc as the best. Before she shows up, the antagonists are under-developed and they've shown basically nothing redeemable besides hints of the same type of camaraderie that were displayed in the Greed Island arc. That changes with the introduction of Komugi, a blind little lass who gets brought in to entertain the king. By playing a game, get your minds out of the gutter. She quickly starts to form a genuine bond with him that he doesn't really understand and that his loyal guards don't know how to react to. This bond becomes central to the character development of the antagonists in the arc and involves some of the best written scenes in the entire series. And she's an interesting character too. She doesn't want to bother anyone due to her physical limitations but she's not weak. She has a lot of mental fortitude and once she's resolved she doesn't change her mind. It's fascinating to watch her even when a lot of what happens in her scenes revolves around playing a game with ill-defined rules.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nFor starters, I have to address the character designs. Some of them are kind of typical; bright-eyed lad with crazy hair and such. But a lot of them are quite unique. The chimera ants have fascinating designs. Even the ones largely based off of one animal have an insect-like influence that makes them more than your typical furry fodder. I also appreciate that the female characters have a lot of diversity. In a lot of these shounen series you'll get the attractive ladies in major roles and, maybe, some unattractive ones who get thrown in for a scene or two as a jape. In this one, one of the major female characters looks like she'd fit in with the muscular machismo of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. There's another, Senritsu, who looks kind of like a Friar Tuck cosplayer. There are also ones like Komugi, who looks rather plain aside from her gigantic eyebrows. The action sequences in this are really stellar. The Nen element allows for a wide variety of different techniques and styles without going overboard to the extent where anything could happen and it would make sense. The animation is very fluid and the world just looks really good.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe acting is really damn good. Like with the characters, I can't talk about every single actor but I'll bring up a few who stand out. Our main heroes are voiced by Han Megumi & Ise Mariya, both of whom deliver superb performances. Tominaga Miina, the voice of Senritsu, also stands out. She sounds very melodic and she's just a joy to listen to. Endou Aya, Yokoyama Chisa & Uchiyama Kouki also stand out for their superb work as Komugi, Biscuit Kreuger & Meruem. Paku Romi is also in this and her character is named Paku. We have Hirano Yoshihisa to thank for the awesome soundtrack. You may also know him from his work on Death Note & Strawberry Panic.\\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nThere's a bit. I already mentioned the men who seem to be aroused off of the idea of fighting twelve year old boys. There are also times where Killua's devotion to Gon and his response come across as being more than friendship. Honestly, they're the same age so I have no problem with that.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nThat's Hunter x Hunter. When all is said and done, I do like it more than Yu Yu Hakusho. It has stronger arcs, character writing and is just generally superior. It's still not perfect and there are definitely things that could have been better handled but I can still heartily recommend it for action fans. My final rating is going to be an enthusiastic 8.5/10. Next week I'll look at Girls und Panzer der film.",

            "content": "Ooooh my goooood. OOOOOOOOH MY GOOOOOOOOOOOOOD.\r\nIf you're having doubts about watching Hunter x Hunter 2011, don't. Watch it. Like, right now. The amount of work put into this series, this franchise, really shows. I honestly cannot think of one thing wrong with this series, besides how sad it gets. (Killua deserved better ;;)\r\nLet's start with story.\r\nThe plot seems bland, reading the synopsis on MAL and Netflix. However, this bland setup makes the series really shine where it should. Gon is a 12 year-old boy who's searching for his long-lost father. Yawn, boring right? Not at all. If you think the plot is boring or clichejust from the first couple episodes or the first season or what your friends say, force yourself through it. The progression of the story and its attention to detail make for a smooth and plothole-less experience. Every little moment is taken into account by Togashi and Madhouse and not a single plot device is left forgotten. The handle on story really makes this story enjoyable, even if every other area was mediocre. That is, IF. Every other area also got a 10/10.\\n\r\nNext is art.\\n\r\nMadhouse truly gave us eyecandy when producing this anime. The art reflects a typical shounen style, but gives us something else underneath, something that even now, I can't quite name. Not to mention Madhouse perfectly captures aging and stress, something that all four main characters are exposed to. The expressions leave me breathless, honestly, just how amazing these characters always look. The animation is stunning. It flows so well, you'd think it were a Western cartoon if you didn't know any better. The fight scenes are spectacular, and the gore is realistic but not over-the-top. You can find similar Madhouse majesties in Death Parade and Parasyte: The Maxim, just to name a couple. If you're looking for excellent art and subtle character growth expressed through the designs, HxH is the way to go.\\n\r\nNow, sound.\\n\r\nThe opening of HxH never changes (good thing it's an excellent song). The song remains the same, though it switches through different parts of the full song, and the visuals change through the varying arcs. The opening is always, always aesthetically pleasing to the eye and really shows each arc the way they are meant to be shown. Some are darker than others, and it reflects the feel of each arc very well. The OST sends shivers down my spine and oooh god I get chills just thinking about it. The ending songs do change, and oh man do they change. Each one, once again, changes according to arc, and I can't pick a favorite. Madhouse, once again, pleases us with its attention to detail, even in the ending credits. I could look up the HxH OST and listen to it for days.\\n\r\nAaaand then there's characters.\\n\r\nI can't even think about the main characters without tearing up. They all go through such tragedies in their own ways. Gon, who grew up sheltered with his family, finally experiences pain and agony throughout the course of the series, and it really changes him. Killua, the good kid with a bad upbringing who only wants to make a friend. Kurapika, whose entire family, everything he'd ever known, was massacred. Leorio grew up in poverty and lost his very best friend to an illness, and now only wants to give medical care for those who can't afford it. They all go through hardships and trauma, and their development in response to that makes them stronger characters. Some even have negative character development, where it's excellent development in a not-so-optimal direction (no spoilers, but it's excellently portrayed and it's very realistic, unlike many shounen out there). The side characters are also incredible. The antagonists range from questionably bad to disgusting garbage. The Chimera Ant arc really shows the show's true nature as far as darkness and existentialism. It plays with some very touchy themes, but never over-does it. Talking about representation, this show is very diverse in its ethnicities, like with Canary and Squala, and even LGBTQ+ inclusion. Pitou, for example, is genderless, and Alluka Zoldyck is a trans girl. It made my experience a lot better knowing that there were such relatable characters even to the extent of appearance and gender. It's representation presented realistically, and not so over-the-top in-your-face like some other franchise do.\\n\r\nAs for my enjoyment, it without question gets a 10/10.\\n\r\nThis series is so amazing in the fact that it has such a wide audience capability. Of course, a shounen's target audience is always younger boys, but Togashi really manages to capture a different audience, the audience being everybody. It's a shame this anime isn't more popular in Western cultures, because I think everybody and their mother deserves to enjoy this series and what it has to offer. There's always a character to relate to and so many tear-jerkers that I had to pause the episode because I couldn't read the subs through my tears. No character gets off completely scott-free after a major event or battle, and while it's sad, it's realistic. I never cried harder over an anime than at the end of the Chimera Ants arc. I'm very glad I decided to watch this series, because even I had my doubts.\\n\r\nThe series ended because it caught up to the manga, which is currently on hiatus with Togashi's health issues. It ended in a phenomenal way, and though some parts of the anime diverged from the manga, it was never enough to affect the plot, mostly just things switched here and there. The anime series is likely on hiatus with the manga, until the manga begins to update regularly again (whenever that may be.) (Togashi come back to us.) (I love you.).\\n\r\nTL;DR, do yourself a favor and watch HxH.",

            "content": "\"Hunter x Hunter\" is the anime adaption of Yoshihiro Togashi's manga of the same name, and is also a reboot of the original anime adaption from 1999. \r\nThis review will contain very few spoilers, and will not break down the story arcs, rather it will analyse the show as a whole and give my overall opinion of the entire show. \r\nStory:\r\nPremise:\r\n\"Hunter x Hunter\" has a very interesting and well set up premise, that is simple to follow from the the very beginning. The story follows Gon Freecss, a 12 year old kid from Whale Island, who has spent his life becoming one with nature andhoning his reflexes and skills, shining in activities such as fishing and things like that. He's an outdoor kid. He has but one goal in mind, to become a \"Hunter\". Despite the name, Hunters are not guys who go around hunting animals, but are elite members of society with great power and influence over the general population, and are a part of the Hunter Association, which are an organised group who regulate Hunters and are a powerful organisation who help maintain the world and its standards.\\n\\n\r\nTo become a Hunter, one must prove themselves in the \"Hunter Exam\", a difficult round of tests where only the most elite people can pass. But Gon does not seek glory, or treasure or fame, he seeks one thing. His Father, Ging, who left him on Whale Island as a baby. Ging happens to be a Hunter, and Gon wants to become a Hunter himself so he can seek out his Dad, follow in his footsteps and find out why he chose being a Hunter over raising his own son.\\n\\n\r\nYes, it sounds like your typical shounen stuff that we've all seen before, but there's many things it has going for it that no other series of the same demographic has.\\n\\n\r\nPacing:\\n\\n\r\nDespite being a long running anime series that is 148 episodes in length. \"Hunter x Hunter\" is very well paced, especially when one compares it to \"Naruto\", \"Bleach\", \"One Piece\", and \"Fairy Tail\". \\n\\n\r\nSeveral people complain that the Chimera Ant Arc is too long, and that the exposition in this arc messes up the pacing to unforgivable levels. I disagree with this statement, and think these people don't fully understand the arc or the genius of its exposition. \\n\\n\r\nThe battles:\\n\\n\r\nAn important aspect to mention about \"Hunter x Hunter\" is it's take on the fighting side of things.\\n\\n\r\n\"Hunter x Hunter\" is different in the way it executes fights, in the sense that the fights themselves are almost never purely about raw strength, brute force, or who can take out the enemy with the biggest and most powerful nuclear. Instead, the battles are all about strategy, tactics and ingenuity.\\n\\n\r\nFor example, the main character Gon isn't all that strong to start with, yet his speed, agility and keen senses give him some edge in battles. He can quickly avoid attacks due to his size and speed, and his senses and adaptability allow him to analyse his opponents and plan some kind of counterattack.\\n\\n\r\nStrategy and smarts are the key here, and everything is so well set up that it works every single time.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character, Gon, is unlike many other shounen characters, in that he is not the strongest character. He has huge potential but he is nowhere near being the most powerful. And unlike many shounen anime, \"Hunter x Hunter\" doesn't have the any sudden or illogical power ups at all. All of the hard work and training that characters put in to become stronger or learn new techniques are shown to viewers so there are no spontaneous new moves that seem like they come from nowhere. On top of this, characters are seen winning battles mostly through tactics as opposed to brute force. The Nen system is also very intricate and thought out, and allows for a huge range of powers. And unlike shounens like Naruto (not hating, I actually like Naruto), it's not the person who has the most chakra (Nen) who wins, but rather who utilizes it the best. \\n\r\nThe battles are almost never one sided, if at all, to the point where you can't even be sure who'll win. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\\n\r\nThe series ends perfectly, with more or less everything resolved. The Manga is actually still on-going, and the Anime had to stop due to Togashi being ill and on hiatus, something he does far too often. Despite this, the series ends at a point, where everything wraps up nicely. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes \"Hunter x Hunter\" stand out, even more than its amazing plot, is its characters. \\n\r\nHere are some details:\\n\\n\r\n\"I can't stand being on the losing end forever!!\"\\n\r\n\u2014 Gon Freecss\\n\\n\r\nGon Freecss: Gon is the main character of \"Hunter x Hunter\", and is typical happy go lucky protagonist who will do anything and everything to achieve his goal of becoming a Hunter and finding his Father. Gon is interesting as far as main character goes, because of how he is. His actions are unpredictable, simply because his personality is unpredictable. Gon does what he wants where he wants.\\n\\n\r\nIt may sound simple, and maybe even a little cliche, but Gon is just interesting to watch, and his development is especially something to note. While he begins with a slow start, Gon develops dramatically, from a simple minded kid, with no experience, to a fast learning, powerful and incredibly strong individual. He is determined, stubborn and downright awesome. Gon has the one trait that most Shounen heroes are lacking these days and that is personality. He is unpredictable. He's just such a likeable and believable main character. And don't even get me started on his incredible character development and well handled morality during the Chimera Ant Arc.\\n\\n\\n\r\n\"Assassination\u2014It's the family trade. We all take it up. My folks see me as an exceptional prospect. But I don't see that I should have to live up to their expectations.\"\\n\r\n\u2014 Killua Zoldyck, to Gon Freecss\\n\\n\\n\r\nKillua Zoldyck: Killua is a young 12 year old boy that Gon meets during the Hunter Exam, and despite the mysterious air about him, and an obvious hostile nature, he and Gon become best friends in a flash.\\n\\n\r\nKillua is a member of the famous Zoldyck family, a family of Assassins, and from an early age was exposed to a life of murder, torture and slaughter. Due to this, despite his appearance, and child-like nature, Killua is actually a cold blooded killer, who revels in blood and enjoys slaughter, making him a sharp contrast to Gon. He is very intelligent for his age and is well versed in various assassination techniques and has agility and stamina on the same levels as Gon does.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, without saying much, Killua is easily the most interesting and well developed character of the series, solely because of his transition from a dark, psychopathic monster, into Gon's best friend and almost blood brother. The development of Killua is simply incredible, as it is not sudden, but is instead a gradual process that happens over time.\\n\r\nKillua is what holds the series together for the most part. He is the most interesting character.\\n\\n\\n\r\n\"Sometimes... Silence is the best answer.\"\\n\r\n\u2014 Kurapika\\n\\n\\n\r\nKurapika Kurta: Kurapika is another protagonist, and befriends Gon and Leorio as they travel together to the Hunter Exam Site. Kurapika also desires to become a Hunter, in order to gain the power and knowledge to avenge his clan: The Kurta, who were slaughtered by an infamous band of thieves known as The Phantom Troupe, who murdered them for their Scarlet Eyes, which are said to be priceless and beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nKurapika is all about revenge and vengeance, and although he mostly appears calm and collected, he is quick to anger, and can be fierce when provoked, especially when it involves his clan or the Troupe. when angered, his Scarlet eyes show themselves, and enhance his abilities to their maximum potential.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of development, Kurapika is also well developed. While he starts off as an emotionless, angst guy who simply cares for nothing but vengeance, as the series progresses, he comes to terms with reality, and realizes the people he still has matter more than his revenge. He's my favorite character of all time.\\n\\n\\n\r\n\"If I become Chairman... I'm going to make the Hunters Association my private property!\"\\n\r\n\u2014 Leorio Paradinight, during his speech\\n\\n\\n\r\nLeorio Paradinight: Leorio is the final member of the main protagonists and is more minor than the rest.\\n\\n\r\nHe claims he wants to become a Hunter solely for the immense amount of money they can acquire and due to the social status and perks that come from being a Hunter, but in reality he has a noble reason behind what he is doing, and merely puts on this front to avoid talking about it.\\n\\n\r\nDespite having the appearance of a middle aged man, Leorio is actually a teenager of 16, yet he acts on a level of maturity equal to that of his appearance. He is easily the least skilled fighter of the group, and isn't too bright either, but he possesses great stamina, determination and an almost unbreakable will that makes him so likeable. He's a very righteous character, who always looks out for others. He also serves as the comic relief character, and tends to do really stupid shit.\\n\\n\r\nHis backstory at this point isn't well explained, and his goal has a ways to go, and therefore Leorio has yet to develop much, but his overall development is still there and is very gradual considering how little screen time he's gotten to himself.\\n\r\nLeorio is easily likeable, and remains an interesting character due to having the role of the \"big brother\" of the group. He keeps everyone together, and it's nice to see.\\n\\n\r\nAnd don't even get me started on Gon and Killua's friendship, which is by far the most believable and emotion educing friendship ever conceived in the anime medium. \\n\\n\r\nIn regards to the stories villains, they are just as well developed and grounded as the protagonists, from the perverted, sexual deviant, yet cunning and incredibly powerful Hisoka, to the mysterious and ever ominous. Phantom Troupe, the villains are always shadowed in mystery, and are just downright interesting.\\n\\n\r\nThe villains are also interesting due to them being more complex than your average Anime villain. While some shows, such as \"Bleach\" and \"Akame Ga Kill\" have villains who are irredeemable and swimming in an endless sea of black morality, the villains of this show are another matter. They are evil yes, but they also show compassion for one another. They treat each other like family, and often act the way they do for reasons other than \"because I can\". The Chimera Ants break this trend later on because they aren't human but the main antagonist of the arc, actually becomes the best written morally grey character of all time.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, after a lengthy explanation. The characters of \"Hunter x Hunter\" are simply perfection. They are all interesting, unique, and well developed.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation:\\n\\n\r\nHunter x Hunter was animated by Madhouse. The production values for this show, especially considering it's a long running anime, are simply incredible.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is unique, with each character being uniquely designed, brightly coloured, and detailed as possible. The locations in which the show takes place are also well done, with detailed backgrounds and colourful and vibrant environments. \\n\r\nThe art contains such amazing attention to detail, that everything from the characters to the locations are just beautiful to gaze upon.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation itself, is excellently done, with every frame captured beautifully, be it movement, combat, or just plain sitting and talking. Nothing is jumpy or jittery. Nothing is stat-icy or lazy. It's just all perfect.\\n\r\nMadhouse did an amazing job at animating this 2011 \"Hunter x Hunter\" anime as when I looked back into the arcs on manga, Togashi's drop in quality is incredibly noticeable yet we don't see it at all in the anime. Everything is consistently beautiful in \"Hunter x Hunter\". \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe music of this show is amazing. I have no issues with it, and find the themes to be fitting, epic and well produced.\\n\r\nThe music is very good at setting the mood and the nostalgia hit hard when I heard these songs after the anime had ended. \\n\\n\r\nHunter x Hunter's OST offered a sentimental feeling that permeated through most of the series. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme is, surprisingly for a long running series, the same one the whole way through and is called \"Departure\". It's catchy, upbeat, and really captures the atmosphere of the series. The lyrics themselves are even symbolic of the series and its complex themes, almost hinting at the series dark undertones. The accompanying opening sequences are always really great too.\\n\\n\r\nThe Ending themes are also really great. The first one, \"Just Awake\" is a strange, yet catchy one. I loved it. The second ending, \"Hunting for your dream\" is excellent and is epic as hell. There's just this really amazing feeling when it plays at the end of each episode. Then, there's \"Reason\" which is again, excellent, and has a very calm and soothing feeling to it. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is solid. All the characters are voiced appropriately. Gon sounds like the little kid he should, Hisoka sounds like a sexual deviant with a lust for blood. Everyone sounds perfect.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound effects are great. There's lots of banging, clanging, and everything else. They feel real, and they give the impact they should. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10 A total masterpiece!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

This is the show. Want an actual good isekai arc in Greed Island? This is the show. Want the best arc in any shonen in the Chimera Ant Arc? This is the show. I honestly don\u2019t have enough words to praise this show. What separates this show from most shonens are the character driven arcs and the trials and tribulations that stem from the characters motives. Along with great motives, the characters are justlikeable. Gon, Killua, Kurapika, Meruem, Hisoka etc. are all eccentric and fascinating characters that all have their flaws that make them unique but grow as well as the series progresses. The writing in this show is also amazing due to the character progression as well. The flaws that each character has makes them stronger characters and them overcoming their flaws in each arc is what makes this show so great. Besides that, the animation is solid throughout. This series in my opinion has some of greatest fight scenes in a shonen because it\u2019s not all just about people punching people. Smart strategies are just in pretty much every fight, making them all entertaining. Madhouse did a great job animating these fight scenes. Overall, I\u2019m pretty empty knowing I can\u2019t watch this show for the first time again. This show is a 10/10 no questions asked. Now if you excuse me, I have to catch up on the manga...",

            "content": "I was a massive fan of Hunter x Hunter as a child, I watched the Arabic dub of the 1999 version and although it was quite censored (I don't remember Killua ripping out anyone's heart when I watched it) it was still gripping. So when I discovered that it was being remade, I went about binge watching to catch up and within four days, I caught up to the anime which was at episode 127 at the time.\r\nSince the show was practically over and I'd already read the manga (I know I know, I should have known about the anime sooner) I was ready togive it a 10/10 at that very moment that I finished episode 126, if you've seen the show then you know why it's this specific episode that triggered that response. There is not a single wasted moment in HxH 2011, with the exception of the early recap episode. Togashi crafts an absolute masterpiece with less focus on world building - the world map in this show is the actual world map flipped upside down- but rather the characters. Don't be fooled by the childish, forever smiling, happy go lucky 11 year old Gon Freeccs that we are introduced to in the beginning. As the story progresses, we follow an ever evolving, ever changing character that is unrecognizable by the end of the series. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter development is where this show outshines more or less every anime I've ever come across. Even the antagonists ( I won't refer to them as villains because that would be doing Togashi a disservice) are written in such a way that you find it hard not to empathize with their cause. The way that Togashi explores characters and delves into their thoughts and motives is what makes this show stand out. The two main characters, Gon and Killua, are introduced as a certain anime trope/stereotype but steadily and surely Togashi slowly deconstructs your view of them and rebuilds them in an entirely new light. Each is the perfect foil to the other and while Gon starts out as the one keeping Killua in check, at the end it's Killua laying his life on the line to protect Gon. This isn't done in such a manner that you notice it happening, it isn't as someone flicked a switch and changed the characters' psychological state and for this reason the story benefits greatly.\\n\\n\r\nThe actual story is on another level to your average fodder (of course it is, this show wouldn't be exceptional otherwise). The world of the Hunter Association is fascinating and well constructed. The system in place seems almost barbaric when you're first watching the exam phase but as more and more professional hunters make their debut in the show, it becomes evident why this gruelling and extremely selective system is in place. Much like the characters, the story itself is just as deceiving. It seems like a simple enough tale of a son searching for his estranged father but goes on to explore themes such as revenge, sacrifice, human malice, evolution, identity crisis and many more very mature themes. Human malice especially is a constantly present theme that is developed further in every arc, culminating in the Chimera Ant arc which is perhaps the shows strongest, most mature arc. Even the \"boss fights\" for lack of a better term are entirely different to other animes. Without going too heavily into any spoilers, there isn't a single antagonist who is defeated with your typical 'friendship powerup by the main character'. Every antagonist is beaten by a carefully laid out plan with much thought and heavy planning by the protagonist and their comrades. While the final arc is much less action and all dialogue, it provides a great ending to a show that seemed like it was nonstop action for 135 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nWith respect to the production, Madhouse deserves all the praise that they've received. The voice acting in particular stands out especially in heavily emotional scenes, episode 116 in particular is a stand out. The animation is more or less consistent throughout the entire show and only delineates from the mean when the animation quality is particularly outstanding such as episodes 126 and 131. The soundtrack is excellent and never seems out of play or over the top. It has a wide range of music from very intense, drum heavy music to some astonishingly fitting classical pieces.\\n\\n\r\nHunter x Hunter is without a shadow of a doubt the most mature show of its kind that I've personally seen and undeniably the best anime of its length. The fact that it is able to keep up that level of quality over 148 episodes is a credit to Togashi's unparalleled story writing and character building.\\n\\n\r\n10/10",

            "content": "I love the story line of hunter x hunter. i wish for more seasons of it and i hope the Dark continental expedition will be put into anime soon. The main characters are awesome, each has a story and goals. the Characters are great, and i could say that Togashi really had a great work in doing the Ant Chimera Arc. 10/10 rate for me in all its arc. =) This is the only anime a watched from 1st to its latest episode because i found the story more adventurous than other anime (only in my opinion). Now what makes Hunter x Hunter my favoriteanime of all..\\n\\n\r\n1. I like the characters, they are well drawn. Gon is adorable, Killua is cute, Leorio is uhmm nice and Kurapika is pretty even though he'a a \"HE\". Also, all characters are well made\\n\\n\r\n2. It adopts modern technology. OMG i had watched the 1991 episode of Hunter x Hunter and it really evolved, now they were able to use smart phones and tablets, LED screen computers its like.. AWESOME!! it seems like they are in the real world... XoX LOL i just love the way they have those techy thing.\\n\\n\r\n3. Though its some kinda violent i like the way they kill characters.. LOL looks weird huh! lots of bloody death, cutting of body parts specially those limbs.. well i haven't seen a lot of anime who lost limbs in a duel, specially the main character.. oh well its only found in Hunter x Hunter i think. So many killings in this anime, even brutally killing of a child by the chimera ants, eating of humans by the chimera ant queen looks kinda disgusting eh specially on what they did on Pokkle and Ponzu really really brutal. and oh i almost forgot, the head of kite cutted by Pitou..\\n\\n\r\n4. Oh those touching moments it makes me cry out loud.. specially on the ant chimera arc where Gon cried a lot when he found out that kite is dead and cannot be revived by Pitou, the death of Chairman Netero and the last game of Meruem with Kumogi.. T.T it really crushes my heart.\\n\\n\r\n5. Zoldyck family is so cool.. They are a family of assassin and they were really really popular on their business. They lived in a mountain so high.. oh they are just so cool.. This what makes Killua a cool rich kid / assassin.\\n\\n\r\n6. A lot of anime are fed up with too many duel/fights, although it may not be controlled as this fights really make a thrill.. Hunter x Hunter has a lot of adventure rather than a duel or maybe i could call it an adventure fight. Like on the Chimera ant arc. Hunter exam arc is more of an adventure thing less fighting more of like a mind game, so as in Chimera ant arc. \\n\\n\r\n7. Gon is really the good kid who can't even kill but i was so shocked during his fight with Pitou, ohw well, usually as observed in other anime, the main character fights the villain  for 3 or more episodes but wow, Gon did it in 1 episode only  that was so fast. \\n\\n\r\n8. The main character doesn't have to fight the boss villain. yea right. this is Hunter x Hunter.  Remember in the York New City Arc when Kurapika should be the one who will fight Chrollo for revenge but it turns out to be Silva and Zeno Zoldyck vs Chrollo because they were hired by the Ten Dons and on the Chimera ant arc, its Mereum Vs. Netero. \\n\\n\r\n9. Characters admits defeat and the main characters doesn't have to fight all the villain like on the chimera ant arc, they have an assigned fight for each villain. e.g. Knuckle and Shoot fight with Youpi and Morel Vs. Pouf.. whats good in this is that they always come up with a teamwork =)\\n\\n\r\nAll of praise to Hunter x Hunter, I still have a lot of praise in my mind.. but ill save it for another review.. =)",

            "content": "After Togashi wrote his more traditional Shonen series with actual climaxes and arcs, Hunter X Hunter is largely nothing but constant subversion with a refusal to bring anything to a satisfying conclusion. Characters and villains are constantly tossed aside after having been built up with no conclusion to their arcs, such as the majority of villains and even half of the so called \"main characters\".\r\nIf villains are ever actually addressed and defeated, the majority of the time it will be done without any kind of fight in a blatant cop out. Most of the arcs have little to no continuity between each other as theyget rid of early side protagonists, and any instances of recurring villains such as Hisoka and the Phantom Troupe are irrelevant to the plot.\\n\\n\r\nThe only constant characters available to follow are Gon and Killua. Gon is largely just generic while Killua gets most of the characterization. His character consists of being incredibly edgy due to his upbringing who wins practically every fight effortlessly, while still trying to appeal to viewers as an arbitrary \"cute\" kid interacting with Gon. It takes over 30 episodes for Killua to even be hit by any kind of attack, and over 40 for him to actually lose.\\n\\n\r\nOnly in the Chimera Ant arc, which starts in episode 76, does the series actually begin to resemble a traditional Shonen and manage to build up some good and interesting characters. Almost all of these characters are completely new or had very little appearances, with the only real carryovers being Gon and Killua who aren't particularly relevant to the plot anymore, with the best episodes being ones where they barely appear. This arc has actual good fights and interesting abilities used in clever ways, after the series has been doing its best to avoid them for the past 75 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I could recommend this series for the first half of this arc, at the point where the heroes invade the villain's palace the series slows to a crawl. From this point on, the series has terrible pacing issues with an obnoxious narrator going over everything in grating detail, and regularly cuts to irrelevant characters such as Ikalgo and Welfin. The series has a highly subverted anticlimax after hours upon hours of great build up, so shocking that I stopped watching the series before the final epilogue episodes in disgust.",

            "content": "Time to review one of the best anime ever. First off, I have to say, I liked the old HxH so much. It was a great show in many aspects. However, I think it is safe to say the 2011 version has surpassed the previous one by all means. This anime is one hell of a rollercoaster that you just can't stop watching. You will start, click next episode over and over and over again without a break. This show is just pure amazingness that anyone and everyone can enjoy. This reboot of the show is phenomenal In every sense and is a must watchmasterpiece for all anime fans. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10/10\\n\r\nI want to start with the characters in this review because I truly think that the characters are some off the best in any anime. The protagonist of Hunter x Hunter 2011 is a 12 year old boy named Gon Freecs. His goal in the show is to find his dad, Ging Freecs. Now on the outside, Gon might seem like the generic shounen protagonist who always fights to save his friends, but soon into the story, we find out there is much more than that to Gon. His true nature is still arcane to us and his role in the story is superb. Next up is Killua Zoldyck, also 12 years old. Killua is part of a large family of assassins and has never really had any freedom up until he meets Gon. Killua's first friend is Gon and he wants, no matter what, to travel the world with Gon in search of Gon's dad and protect him. While Killua wants to help Gon, it is really Gon who is helping Killua and endure his family problems and he is a great character to watch grow. Leorio is the third main character at the age of 19. He is such an interesting character and its a shame he is so sidelined. Leorio had lost a friend to a treatable disease and took the hunter exam to get enough money to go to medical school. He is probably the funniest character in the show and its truly sad we don't get more of him. Last of the main characters is Kurapika. Kurapika is part of a clan called the kurta, who are famous for scarlet eyes. His clan was annihilated in order to get the kurta eyes by a group called the phantom troupe. Kurapika's goal is to seek revenge on the group that killed his clan. Watching Kurapika grow as a character and seek revenge was excellent and he remains one of my favorite characters in the series. Last, but definitely not least, are the supporting characters of Hunter x Hunter. There is so much I could say about these characters. The list goes on and on with great characters like Hisoka, Neferpitou, Meruem, etc. The list is ongoing and each supporting character/villian has such amazing growth and development in the show that you end up being amazed with all that they do. The characters in Hunter x Hunter are truly outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 10/10\\n\r\nThe story, as I said before is about Gon trying to find his dad, Ging Freecs, who is a hunter as well and Gon has never met him before. He goes through many hardships and trials to seek out his dad who is shrouded in mystery. The story starts out with the four main characters taking the hunter exam to become hunters for their own goals and dreams. Killua trying to break his families spell, Kurapika trying to avenge his clan by killing off the phantom troupe, and lastly Leorio becoming a superb doctor. After the hunter exam, the story really takes a turn for the better. Each arc that comes to pass is about our characters goals and dreams and each arc up until now improve and improve. The current arc of the Chimera Ant Arc is definitely the best one yet. Each character has to go through their own hardships and improve themselves enough to become good enough to achieve the goals they are striving for.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9/10\\n\r\nThe art in the show is by far superior to that of the original's. The art makes the battles and scenes all around intense and is pretty great on yours eyes to look at. I honestly have no real complaints for this.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10/10\\n\r\nAs I write this review, I am currently listening to osts from this anime. The ost list is wonderful. Each arc has a variety of osts they really stand out and fit each scene so perfectly, specifically OST 3, which contains osts mainly for the chimera ant arc. Hunter x Hunter does something a little different with the openings. Rather than change it completely every so often like most shounen anime, HxH using the same opening (departure) and changes the version of it every so often. Its quite a decent opening so this difference works here. The endings are also very enjoyable to listen to. The voice actors are really decent and do their characters voice so well; Gon's especially.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10/10\\n\r\nI had so much enjoyment watching this. From start to finish I just couldn't stop watching the show. I ended up marathoning the whole show (110 episodes at the time) in just a week. This is a very outstanding show to enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10/10\\n\r\nThis show is a masterpiece. From story to characters to art to sound, everything in this show is perfect. I cannot fathom a person disliking this show at all. It's just that good. All in all this series just keeps you on the edge of your seats and I hope that this brings in more people to enjoy the masterpiece I have enjoyed so much.",

Watching the 2011ver was like watching a whole new show that brings back good times. Never seen a anime that hooked me like HxH. One thing I know is that I will never forget about this anime because of how great it waswatching it.\\n\\n\r\nI've learned a lot from watching HxH and also noticed that \"Togashi is a lot like Ging going on hiatus & not there when we need him most and us fans are like Gon can't be mad or do nothing but be happy when he makes a chapter. Maybe even cry when the anime comes back lol.\"",

            "content": "-Spoiler Alert, Read at own risk-\r\n\"If you want to get to know someone, find out what makes them angry.\"\r\n-Gon Freecss\r\nI'm angry because of the hiatus of this anime, and that makes me an otaku. xD\r\nbut I wish Togashi could get better so he can continue writing hxh, and plus he can't write 100% if he force himself to write while sick, I want at it 100% reading the manga and anime. I think he is one of the best writers out there, his other masterpiece yuyu hakusho. This is one hell of an anime it is consistent of every aspect. What's great about this animeis that the equal time of feeling in it. The time to hate, the time to love, and the time to be happy. \\n\\n\r\nThe first time I watch this was like ughhh, another typical shounen anime shiznit. I felt like I was gonna drop it in the first episode. But then I just kept pressing the next button and the next. The next thing I knew I was already singing the opening song. Really I hate myself for hating this anime at first. It must be a shounen manga but a shounen manga you have never seen before!\\n\\n\r\n-Story 11-\\n\r\nThe story 11 but cant give 11 here. At first you might think the flow of the story has no complexity just about a kid who sets out on a journey to find the reason why his father abandoned him to be a hunter. But then he meets this 3 people, one who swore revenge, one who desire riches and one who wants to be released. The four of them together take the hunter exam, and this were this gets serious \"Nen\" its like an life energy which in chinese called \"Chi\" similar to chakra. The complexity almost makes you think how can a human think of these? Thousands of fighting styles can be made if you know how to use nen. It is so creative. This is just outstanding no need to say more spoilers just watch it and you will learn why I gave this 11. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter developement, flashbacks, flow of the story. It was delivered how Togashi wanted it supposed to be. And that what makes Togashi the one of the best writers. Seriously  it made me cry, happy, angry, and fell in love with the story of each characters.\\n\\n\r\n-Art 10-\\n\r\nThe art is magnificent. Character design, backgrounds, and powers. It is well detailed, This is what amazing about madhouse, it was consistent considering this was a long term anime. It is pleasing to the eye. It is cute when you look at it, what makes it good that it is a little childish. If it were more adult looking it thing the show would go gore and horror. I think it is amazing colorful, bright but not to bright well balanced art. It's something you can display on an art museum.\\n\\n\r\n-Sound 10-\\n\r\nThe sound is good but gets better and better when you watch it. The soundtrack in the fighting scenes were the best of the best. It get me get of my feet and feel like rocky. Man, feel like I'm the one fighting. The seiyuu was great, it really fits the art perfectly.\\n\\n\r\n-Character 10-\\n\r\nCharacter oh characters, I don't even no where to begin. Should I begin with the protagonist or the antagonist? Im gonna start with the protagonist, the four protagonist really stroke there story in ma heart *cry* I mean the reasons why they want to be a hunter. Those characters really, they have a special something in themselves not all protagonist has that. It's makes you feel like you the protagonist it self. \\n\\n\r\nThe antagonist is well the reason why this story is sosososo goooood! You just can't hate them. Hisoka, Phantom troupe, Meruem what other characters are like them? I don't know how to feel about them, should I hate or love? Damn!\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment 10-\\n\r\nI don't even need to talk about these, should I? I wanted to sleep but I can't, I tell my self another lie \"last episode\" but then realize that I was doing it again. I even pass out in my desktop watching this anime. It was fun even though got stiff neck it was worth! It is enjoyable, worth 148 episode but hoping for more!\\n\\n\r\n-Overall Over9000-\\n\r\nYeah, you know exaggerating. but at every aspect of this anime it never cease to amaze me. I recommend this if you want to watch a not to mainstream shounen anime. This is a masterpiece. I hope there will be more, T_T I am waiting for you Master Togashi! \\n",

I would only consider giving something a 10 if I felt left thinking there was nothing I would change, and that's exactly what HxH did.\r\nThe story does starts off a bit more like a typical shonen... but by god does the rest of the series make up for it...  It's honestly everything I've ever wanted from an anime and more... \r\n\u2022 Never have I been so attached to an anime.\r\n\u2022 Never have I been so satisfied bythe fight scenes level of detail in strategy.\\n\r\n\u2022 Never have I been so complimentary of the power systems level of balance and unique ideas such as vows and limitations and clear rules that are followed through the whole anime.\\n\r\n\u2022 Never have I been so emotionally attached to characters relationships.\\n\r\n\u2022 Never have I been so amazed by how much forethought, subtle foreshadowing, and extremely complex the plot was.\\n\r\n\u2022 Never have I been so in love with a soundtracks and artwork (especially in the CA arc).\\n\r\n\u2022 Never have I been so though provoked about controversial mindsets of characters, where even though they are antagonists to the main characters, I still understand their perspective and even like them, sometimes more than the main characters. Not just your typical 'evil' guy who is inherently bad, but just a different frame of mind that has real, good reasons for why they are doing what they do.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I've been watching anime since I was a little boy.... I'm 24 now and I feel more attached to this anime then I have been to any other anime. Period. That's something that I thought I wouldn't get out of an anime anymore now that I'm older... But HxH really did change that for me...\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps its not a show for everyone... but it's perfect for me... I loved everything about it... The art, sound, characters, story, everything!

Ok now that's settled lets get onto the review!\r\nThe storyline is brilliant, it has your typical main character that's weak but eventually builds himself into a machine and you'd think that would get boring and generic right? No not in this show. The characters are developed so well you geta liking to all of them even the so called villains or enemies I.e (hisoka, meruem and chrollo) it has good pacing not a fight every episode but a good mix between fillers, training so you see his progress and yeah it's great! \\n\r\nMusic brings a nice feel while listening to it, nothing amazing but it suits it well. The bond that gon makes with all of the people throughout the story shows what a great natured kid he is. My personal favourite characters would have to be killua and hisoka for their different styles of fighting and how they act. All together this gets a 10/10 I hope you guys weren't too bored reading this haha",

            "content": "I've been putting off watching Hunter x Hunter for the longest time ever. Since I picked it up, the only thing I've regret is, not picking it up sooner. \r\nIf you're looking for an anime that gives you both heart-warming AND heart-wrenching feelings, you have come to the right place because no other anime has sent me on an emotional trainwreck like Hunter x Hunter. \r\nStory: 10/10 \r\nAs a long-time shounen fan, what bothers me the most about a majority of shounen series is the story; the lack of flow between arcs and the inconsistency. Hunter x Hunter is none of that, it is thoroughlyconsistent in the pacing (except for Chimera Ant Arc) throughout majority of the series. \\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, Hunter x Hunter gives reason behind the reasons WHY our protagonists go to certain places for the next arc - the fact that this is striving towards their goals (for Gon - to find his dad). Every single battle, every single interaction - this all strives for a bigger meaning in the arc and the bigger picture. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10 \\n\r\nMadhouse did an amazing job at animating this 2011 Hunter x Hunter anime as when I looked back into the arcs on manga, Togashi's drop in quality is incredibly noticeable yet we don't see it at all in the anime. Everything is consistently beautiful in Hunter x Hunter. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10 \\n\r\nThe voice actors did an amazing job in portraying the characters' emotions. I'm thoroughly impressed by the cast and how they performed their roles in Hunter x Hunter. The background music is usually tasteful and suiting to the scenario, I have no complaints there. \\n\\n\r\nThe only thing that I didn't like was the opening (as a lot of people mention likewise) - it's repetitive for 148 episodes, and personally, it's not my cup of tea. They could've picked a better opening but I've settled to skipping to 1:30 in most episodes. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10 \\n\r\nStory and Character in Hunter x Hunter go hand-in-hand. As with the driving of the plot, we see a LOT of character development in A LOT of characters. \\n\r\nPart of the reason why I think it is amazing though is the fact that characters actually die after they receive character development - incredibly realistic considering the circumstances of the story. \\n\\n\r\nThe only complaint I have towards the characters would be in Leorio - I haven't read the manga so I'm not sure how Togashi continues Hunter x Hunter, but Leorio hasn't received as much attention as the others as the anime is (considering he is one of our protagonists). However, the antagonists especially - is one of the best in ANY anime series. \\n\r\nHisoka, Illumi, Meruem, and Kuroro are one-of-a-kind, you will find yourselves in love with these characters EVEN if you don't agree with half of the things they do. I found myself contemplating what I would do if I were in their shoes for a major part of the series, and found it incredibly heart-breaking. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10 \\n\r\nI've never had an anime where I cried, laughed, felt grossed out, wanted to chuck a fit and feel sorry for the characters SO MUCH, as I did with Hunter x Hunter. \\n\r\nAt the end of Chimera Ant Arc, I bawled my eyes out - during the 13th Chairman Election Arc, I laughed so hard. \\n\r\nAnd best of all, Killua and Gon's relationship is probably one of the most heart-warming and heart-wrenching friendships you will ever come across in ANY anime. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nYou won't regret watching Hunter x Hunter, it is worth it and honestly, it is now my favourite anime in my books after watching it - even after watching anime consistently for 9 years.",

            "content": "I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s not an adventure shonen with fillers!\r\nIf you like FMA, Naruto, Bleach, Attack on Titan or Death Note, stop reading and go watch it now until episode 3 at least. This show is one of those classics that inexplicably managed to go relatively unnoticed by anime fans, although this remake gave it some deserved recognition. Be warned, though I mention other series along the way I'm not hating on them, I like them but I'm just comparing them to this series.\r\nOVERALL 10/10\r\nThis remake is another gem by Madhouse. I also recommend the first anime by Nippon Animation, but the remake covers alot more of the manga that started in 1998. This is an incredible series and, contrary to what you might think given its episode count, DOES NOT HAVE FILLER ARCS. There are two recap episodes and that\u2019s it. The show is faithful to the manga 99% of the time and there are only two instances that I found upsetting about this adaptation, though they don\u2019t hurt the series overall and you wouldn\u2019t notice them unless you read the manga or watched the NA version. \\n\r\nThis series is about hunters: professionals that travel around the world on different, generally dangerous missions.  They often specialize in a specific field, so you have archeological hunters, who find and restore ruins; gourmet hunters, who find exotic ingredients (probably the inspiration for Toriko XD); blacklist hunters, who find and catch criminals, and so on. The flipside is that there are numerous benefits to being a hunter, but it is really difficult to become one.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY AND SETTING 10/10\\n\r\nThis series is ideal for marathoning, because almost every episode moves the story forward in a significant way. The story is very good, but given it is from the 90s, it starts a bit slow and generic so it may turn off impatient people. Bear with me, after the third episode the plot takes off. Every arc is totally unique but somehow connects with the rest, and there's a lot variety to choose from: an arc with chuunin-like exams and survival games, a (short) training and fighting arc, a complex thriller involving maffia and terrorism (my personal favorite), SAO done well, and one that I will not mention because it's probably the best and I won't spoil it. The plot twists are almost never predictable: the author is expert in trolling the viewer in a pleasant way. If you are tired of watching battle shonens in which every arc ends with a fight between the protagonist and the arc villain, this series is for you. The author is never afraid of subverting tropes. In some arcs the protagonist plays second fiddle or even is put on a bus, but that\u2019s because there are actually four main characters and the story is set in alternate world similar to ours in which not everything is solved with punches. Therefore, the focus is always more on adventure; battles always take a second or third place. That doesn\u2019t mean the battles are lame, though, there aren\u2019t many, but they are always good because there is a great focus on strategy and psychology. As you might expect from other series of this genre, there are superpowers involved, but the author developed a pretty detailed and consistent system that makes sure there are no asspulls like in other shows, and DEATHS ARE FINAL. The nen abilities (the superpowers akin to chakra, cosmos or ki) are very imaginative and interesting, and not always created for fighting. I recommend to watch at least until episode 37, in which one of the best arcs in anime history starts. While the manga hasn't finished (actually it's on hiatus as of this writing), the anime ends at a point that feels like a very good conclusion but still leaves the door open for continuation. This is when you will hate the author, Yoshihiro Togashi, because he is prone to hiatus and the last one is one year long and counting. And yes, the current manga arc is very promising :C There are two non-canon movies as well: they are entertaining but for the most part an excuse for flashy battles that do not follow the rules of nen.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS 10/10\\n\r\nThis series has some of the best characters I have ever seen. Gon, the protagonist, is initially an homage to child Goku, your standard idiot hero with pure heart and simple mind, except that he wants to become a hunter to find his father, who abandoned him to become a hunter. A bit generic, but as the series goes on, he starts developing and meets and befriends other hunter candidates that are increasingly complex and interesting. One particular example is Kurapika, the most obvious inspiration for Sasuke but less emo and more balanced. Special mention goes to Killua, Gon's best friend and a polar opposite to him in almost every way (no wonder he's a fan favorite). Oh, and he's also a former assassin, cute. As you might guess, what\u2019s interesting about this series is that morality sometimes gets thrown out of the window just like in FMA: whether the protagonists or the villains are right sometimes depends on you. In fact, some villains are so charismatic, mysterious and complex that they steal the show every time they appear, even in short appearances. This is particularly true for the Spiders (the likeliest inspiration for Akatsuki but done right), Hisoka, and Meruem. There are no romantic subplots, but one arc (widely considered the best one) contains one of the best love stories I've ever seen in anime, I was moved to tears.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND 9/10\\n\r\nThe sound effects are very good. The music is just awesome, as expected of the same composer that worked on Death Note (expect some familiar motifs). Mozart\u2019s Lacrimosa is played in one especially epic scene, and if you don\u2019t get goosebumps from it you\u2019re probably not human. The only problem is that a few tracks are misused and break the mood of some scenes and the SAME OPENING SONG is used in all 148 episodes, albeit with a few remixed versions (yes, it's annoying enough to not give Sound a 10). The are many endings songs which kinda make up for it. The all-star cast of voice actors do a great job. Many voices will ring a bell: KENN, Ayumi Fujimura, Miyuki Sawashiro, Kouki Uchiyama, Hiroki Takahashi, Daisuke Namikawa, Aya Hirano, Fumihiko friggin' Gendo Tachiki, ROMI PARK, MAMORU MIYANO, BANJOU GINGA!! you get the point, the list goes on and on. With Kana Hanazawa and Hiroshi Kamiya the list would've been perfect :C\\n\\n\r\nART AND ANIMATION 9/10\\n\r\nThe art is pretty good, although the mood and style is a bit more colorful and happy than the dark style of the NA version, which nailed it in my opinion. The art style and effects improve upon the manga but manage to stay faithful, and the animation is pretty good for a long-running series. I don\u2019t remember instances of cringe-worthy \u201cquality animation\u201d that made Shippuuden and other series so infamous. However, some episodes feel a bit uninspired in their use of angles and animation, probably to save budget for more action-packed episodes. There are a lot of gory scenes in the manga that were cleverly toned down (no lazy black fog censoring), since this was aired on a Sunday morning timeslot.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 10/10\\n\r\nTotally recommended, and a mandatory watch for battle-adventure shonen fans.\\n\r\nThe NA version became my favorite anime of all time, but I can't deny the awesomeness of this remake. Even after witnessing other hits such as Attack on Titan, Evangelion, FMA or Death Note, this series remains my favorite.\\n",

            "content": "Hunter x Hunter is the definition of perfection. The characters, music, visuals, storyline and art style are all astonishing.\r\nVisuals \r\nThe visuals stay nothing less than mind-blowing. Absolutely amazing animation. A lot of anime's in this genre, especially ones that are based around a lot of combat and go over 100 episodes, tend to get a little sloppy with presentation after a while. However, this anime, in fact, does the opposite and the animation improves astonishingly throughout.\r\nMusic \r\nThe music nailed everything. I listen to Hunter x Hunter music everyday, and never get bored of it. Some OST's are so emotional, tears run down your face fromjust hearing them. Others are so epic, it's as if it forces you to turn up the volume to full so you can appreciate and experience the awesomeness of a piece.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters \\n\r\nThere is not a single character that i ever felt was annoying or had no purpose or were not developed enough. Even the smaller roles and extras, all had so much detail into their design and personality. This anime makes you really get to know every single person and have some sort of relationship with them.\\n\\n\r\nProtagonists \\n\r\nThe four protagonists: Gon, Killua, Kuapika and Leorio are the heart and soul of this anime. Especially Gon and Killua. Seeing the two total opposites make a tight relationship, and watching it grow is really the bread and butter of the story. One coming from a happy childhood and another from brutal torture; there was nothing to make this any better. They all have their goals and dreams and it's amazing watching them develop through their many adventures with and without each other.\\n\\n\r\nStoryline \\n\r\nThe storyline is on a different level to anything I have ever read, seen or watched in my lifetime. The story is so mind-blowing, so shockingly elaborate, you will never be bored. For 148 episodes, to never have one of them bore you seems impossible, however, this one does it to perfection. The contrast of moods and genres change so swiftly it all works together perfectly. The beginning feels like your watching a happy family friendly anime. But by episode 50, it becomes so gory, so violent, so intense, even adults look away.\\n\\n\r\nMorals \\n\r\nThe greatest aspect of this is that it's not just a fight against good and evil. Sometimes to roles of evil swap between the protagonists and their rivals. All the characters are human and suffer through difficulties of life. Whatever those are, it can make someone a good person or a bad person. Watching the righteous and the unrighteous swap roles is really breathtaking.\\n\r\nIt even makes you question your own goodness, or whether if we as a human race have any at all. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion \\n\r\n I rated it 10/10, as i feel nothing i have watched, can top it in the aspects of characters, visuals, music and art style. Hunter x Hunter is the best anime out there.",

            "content": "From my analysis of the Chimera Ant arc, originally posted on instagram:\r\nThe Palace Invasion that takes place during the Chimera Ant arc of Hunter X Hunter may be the most ambitious and downright crazy thing that has ever happened in anime/manga history. The idea to have about 30 episodes of the anime take place over the course of around 5 minutes in the show sounds like a terrible idea but Togashi was somehow able to pull it off. Pulling off such a feat can only be described as genius. The amount of character development that happens during this period is astonishing. To give some examples,Pitou goes from a creature who only sees humans as prey to one that is able to recognise the value of human life, all before her/his own life is cut tragically short. Youpi goes from a monster that only sees humans as weaklings to a compassionate person capable of recognising the effort that the humans are putting in to fight and even respect them for it. There are far more masterful developments in character in this 5 minute time period but frankly there\u2019s just not enough space to write about them. The Palace Invasion is also a great study in chaos theory as every little thing that happens has a massive effect on everyone involved. It may not sound like it, but watching Killua turn around for a split second was incredibly stressful as it had been established that time was of the essence and even the smallest change in plans could have negative consequences on the entire operation. The fact that Togashi was able to construct all of these scenarios and how they would affect each other so well is unbelievable. Not to mention the fight between Netero and Meruem, to even argue that this isn\u2019t the greatest fight in anime history is stupid. Perhaps the most interesting thing about the whole fight is the moment in which Netero chooses not to converse with Meruem before the fight out of fear that they might actually come to an understanding. I wish I could write more but unfortunately Instagram has a word limit. I hope that I have expressed why this aspect of the Chimera Ant arc is so great. (Continued in part 2)\\n\\n\r\nMeruem is the Chimera Ant arc\u2019s main villain and my favourite character in the entire series. The character arc that Meruem goes through is perhaps the best in anime/manga history and is the backbone for the entire arc. When Meruem is first introduced he is a ruthless leader who believes that he is destined to rule the world and therefor has absolutely no value for anyone else\u2019s life. It is safe to say that Meruem had absolutely no redeeming qualities and was the personification of evil upon his introduction. However, this all changes when the young blind girl Komugi is introduced. At first Meruem sees her only as an opponent to play board games with to kill time but without realising eventually comes to value her life. A brilliant scene that shows this is the scene in which Meruem has decided to kill her to reaffirm his own power, however when he comes across her being attacked by a bird he rushes to her rescue. This scene is beautiful as it not only confirms that Meruem does in fact care about Komugi but presents him in a light that had never been scene up to that point, one of compassion and humanity. Togashi did an excellent job painting Meruem in such a humane light when he was born to be the complete opposite. Meruem\u2019s care for Komugi escalates to the point in which it completely changes his outlook on the world. Through Komugi, Meruem was able see the value in human life. Meruem\u2019s fight with Netero further cements these thoughts that he had been having. Despite being a human, Netero had been able to reach such power that he was able to harm him. This causes Meruem to respect someone\u2019s fighting ability for the first time, thus also recognising the potential for human evolution. It is this tremendous amount of character development that makes it all the more heartbreaking to see Meruem meet his end. Despite being heartbreaking, it is beautiful in a way as Meruem is able to spend his final moments with the one that he cherishes the most, Komugi. I have said it many times, but Togashi is truly a genuis. To progress Meruem\u2019s character from a ruthless monster to the most human character in the entire arc is absolutely brilliant. (Continued in part 3)\\n\\n\r\nThe portrayal of humanity in the Chimera Ant arc is perhaps the most thought provoking part of the entire arc and plays a big part in making it the masterpiece that it is. Throughout the arc, the human characters seem to slowly lose their humanity while the ants become more and more human. This is mostly shown through the parallel character arcs of Meruem and Gon. I have discussed Meruem at length in a previous post so this part will be focused mostly on Gon. Gon starts of as perhaps the most compassionate and human character in the entire anime but due to the horrific things he has to endure, he changes into more of a monster than any of the ants. This change paints humanity in a very negative light as even the most human character of all is easily emotionally broken and brought down to the level of the inhuman ants. All the while, the ants are portrayed in an increasingly positive light, this is shown mostly through Meruem\u2019s character arc but also when Pitou has to stop Gon from succumbing to his rage and killing both her and the injured human that she is treating. In this moment, Gon is willing to kill an innocent human purely because he lacks the humanity that he once had. This negative portrayal of humanity is also present in Meruem\u2019s fight with Netero. Despite this fight being between a monster and a human, it is genuinely hard to want either of them to win, this is due to the humanity that Meruem has developed. As I have said before, my favourite moment of this entire fight is the moment in which Netero chooses not to converse with Meruem out of fear that they might come to an understanding. Meruem only wishes to have a discussion with Netero and even says that he can only be defeated with words. Netero recognises that Meruem has now become more human than most humans and therefor decides to try and kill him before he has the chance the actually think about his actions. This in turns makes not only Meruem look like the more human one, but the Chimera ant species as a whole. There are countless scenes in which Meruem\u2019s character arc portrays humanity in extremely negative ways but I believe I have made my point. (Continued in part 4)\\n\\n\r\nIn closing, the Chimera Ant arc of Hunter X Hunter is possibly my favourite arc in anime/manga history. If you disagree then that\u2019s fine, but I consider it a masterpiece. The purpose of these posts was to have somewhere to direct people to when they asked why I loved the arc so much. I feel as though I have made my thoughts on the Chimera Ant arc very clear and probably don\u2019t need to make another post about it ever again. Let me know if you liked the posts and whether you would be interested in me doing something similar in the future (a multiple part series on an anime). Thanks. (Chimera Ant arc score: 10/10)\\n",

Hunter x Hunter may seem like a childish, stereotypical shounen anime, but it isn't. Trust me, this anime deserves to be the number one anime on this website. Every single character is perfectly developed, the main character is exactly what a main character should be like, and it has that sense of underlying darkness, but not overwhelmingly so, like other anime tend to do. The animation is amazing too, the fight scenes are vivid and quick paced, and will keepyou wanting more. I finished every episode in 2 weeks, i loved it so much. My number 1 anime, of all time.",

An enjoyable anime that gives you unforgettable and happy moments which makes your ass laugh off? Want to find out? Then if you have time, try continue reading this review but if not, then it's okay of you skipped my review.\r\nHunter x Hunter (2011) is the completed and alternative version of the series HxH back in 1998 with better quality. The story is all about the adventures of four friends, I think you all know allabout the story since you have read the synopsis. You should NOT underestimate this anime. Don't be fooled by their looks. Even if the main protagonist, Gon, looks like a kid doesn't mean that this is a childish show. As you can see it's rated \"R-17+\" since it contains violence. Hunter x Hunter is a hidden gem (since a lot of people don't know this anime and it's really wonderful), a RARE shounen anime that comes into your life, an once-in-a-lifetime chance.\\n\\n\r\nThe art or drawing of this anime is really good, and the quality is simply one of the best, the creativity between colors gives out an outstanding view which makes you say \"Wow!\". Therefore, I gave it a 10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development is simply amazing! You shouldn't underestimate the 2 young protagonists, they have a good relationship with each other which makes you think that this is what best friends are truly are. The development between the supporting and main grows which makes their bonds grow strong. But there's a teensy weensy problem and it's that I find the other characters annoying.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound... It was really catchy and you can really call the OP and ED an earworm. The ending songs are really exceptionally good, they picked the right sound at the right time. The OST was good.\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment of this anime is that it never lets me down and makes me beg more and more. This anime never fails me to laugh and cry, the thrills sent to my skin was really tense and the battles are like double-edged swords, never fails me to surprise and scream (which my neighbour hears).\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this childish anime that you think of is not as kiddie as you think, this anime had already fooled me, I hated this anime before because I think it's childish but later on it became one of my favorites. You might not get interested because of their innocent face but as episodes pass by, you might reconsider them and think that they're really not that innocent after all. And of course I LOVE this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe story wasn't rushed and the pacing is neither fast or slow, this is what you expect on a perfect anime.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend you to watch this, if you want shounen, or battles with tense. But if you don't want to, then it's okay because I'm not forcing you to watch this magnificent masterpiece. \\n\\n\r\n(If I typed in a wrong spelling and grammar, please excuse it for I'm not that really good at English and this review is based on my own opinion and experience)",

            "content": "TL;DR\r\nHunter x Hunter was in short, a lent down. \r\nWhy did I find it a disappointment? ...The reason is because about 25% of the story I found interesting. The rest was straight up boring. \r\nGreat battles and fights scenes though. \r\nNo fillers\r\nNicely animated\r\nSTORY: 5\r\nAbout a really strong (for unknown reason) 12 year old wanting to become a hunter to search for his father who's also a hunter. Throughout the series, it starts with Gon taking the hunter exams, trying to find his dad, training, making friends, and running into baddies along the way. \r\nI'm okay with that. It's mostly about how well the story isgoing to be executed that will determine if it's interesting or not. Well..... I was bored. A lot of the scenes felt like I wanted to fast forward through them. There are currently 7 Arcs, and I only enjoyed Yorknew Arc, and latter half of Chimera Ant arc. Those two arcs were worth watching. As for the rest, it just felt like I was watching fillers with boring ass bad guys & other lame stuff. *shrugs*  Maybe a few scenes here and there that were interesting, but most of the time it was dull for various reasons such as I found the characters being introduced dull, or the events/scene to be dull.\\n\\n\r\nI also didn't like that Gon and Killua were so strong for their age. It just didn't feel too believe-able. For one of the arcs, a bunch of really strong bad guys show up, and instead of calling in more professionals, they let these somewhat unknown, albeit strong, but still inexperienced kids get involved? I don't know man..... Things just don't feel right at times.  \\n\\n\r\nThis show's got great battles! If you want shounen for the battles, then HxH is the way to go. The fights aren't just about brawn/strengths but rely on tactics and is well thought out sometimes. This is one of the pros to HxH.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe style is simple, not much different than the average anime look. Just depends on what you like. One thing I appreciated was that the characters aren't overly sexualized. Overall, some plain character designs. That's ok. It's about the story. The animation quality on the other hand, is excellent. High quality animated fight scenes and non fight scenes. So yeah, that was nice.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 7\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 6\\n\\n\r\nI only liked a small handful of characters honestly. The rest were...meh or forgettable. \\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 6\\n\\n\r\nI'm not enjoying the overall story or the journey thus far. The end goal being reached left an unsatisfying feel for me, and felt anti-climatic.\\n\\n\r\n*********SPOILER *********\\n\\n\r\nI'm talking about the part where Gon finally meets his dad. His goal was to become a hunter and find his dad. They made it seem like it was going to be so fking difficult to track/find him. But nope, he's right there. And how they met up was ....hmmm.....boring? I wish it had been written a little better there, because that was supposedly a huge milestone for the story right? But the way it played out was pretty much uneventful, and kinda lame to be honest. \\n\\n\r\n******END OF SPOILER ******\\n\\n\\n\r\nAh well maybe it's just me being picky. \\n\\n\r\nOther than the 2 arcs mentioned earlier, the rest of HxH just felt bland. I don't understand the praise.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 6.7 \u2248 7\\n\\n\r\nI think Hunter x Hunter is a good shounen (especially for the battles), but personally, I think it's overrated. The story is what brought it down for me. This is subjective, but had it been 5/7 instead of 2/7 arcs that kept me interested, have that \"specific event\" better executed, and more interesting characters, I would've probably given it a 9.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, I'm not a huge of shounen fan, so this review might be better for people like that.  However, if you're a big fan of shounen/Naruto, give it a try. You'll probably enjoy it more than I did.\\n",

            "content": "Ok everyone, deep breaths.  I really don't want to exaggerate and jeopardize any credibility of mine, but what you will be reading is simply the objective truth about this show.  \r\nHunter x Hunter triumphs over every single shonen ever created, three times over.  \r\nWho should watch this show? Anyone who likes action and especially anyone who likes the classic \"main streams\" (Naruto, Bleach, One Piece, Fairy Tale .. and many more like them).  It's the Shonen that did everything right.  It's without a doubt my favorite anime of all time, but lets get to the specifics.\r\nStory: 9.99/10\r\nWeird score, I know.I can't give Hunter X Hunter a 10/10 for story because the first 13 episodes were simply boring.  This is for a variety of reasons.  One being the show is long, and I'm accustomed to watching 26 episode animes.  Another reason being that the author did this on purpose because he wanted to build it up.  I think some of it could have been sped up a bit.  I think 8 episodes of generic story telling would have been perfect, but that's just me.  Get to episode 14 and you will not stop.  \\n\\n\r\nNow, why is the story so good?  Hunter X Hunter, unlike any other Shonen, stuck to its premise from day one.  It's almost strange actually.  The author never threw you any real plot changing curve balls.  The story is about a young boy, Gon Freecs, and his adventures as a Hunter while he looks for his father.  \"His adventures\" is the entire show.  One thing that separates this show is that the show could have been about any other person.  Gon has no destiny, God like power, and won't end up becoming Hokage.  He's just a boy who has a heck of a story when its all done.  Everything is built up in the perfect amount of time.  The story makes you sad when it wants to, happy, angry, excited and all that stuff. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nIf the art of the show is fine (nothing special, but nothing that took away from the show), then I rate the art an 8.  It's an 8 for about the first half of the show.  In the second half the art dramatically improves and has excellent  colors and draws the movements very well.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nI'm listening to music from the show while writing about it.  The music immerses you in whatever emotion the show is trying to make you feel.  It's perfect in every sense of the word.  Some people may not like that the opening is the same throughout.  Despite this, there are more that 40 distinctive songs in the show. I've seen lists of like 120, but some of them will just be the same song in a different tone or with different instruments.  The endings themes are especially good I think.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 15/10  \\n\r\nNever have I seen this before.  The characters are just perfect.  There is no one dimensional character in Hunter x Hunter.  No one is a perfectly good or bad guy.  Everyone has a very human like personality.  \\n\\n\r\nGon cares about his friends a lot but could care less about anyone else.  He's not interested in some high moral ground, and is willing to do some messed up stuff if you drive him to that point.  Also, and importantly, he's weak.  Gon loses more often than he wins, would have died like 3 times if it weren't for his best friend Killua.  He's very bad at thinking rationally.  Unlike your typical absent mind main characters, Gon's tendency to only rely on his instincts is one of the things that get him in the biggest trouble in the show.  He still has some main character special qualities, but it's not overdone.  All in all he's pretty likable and makes for the best main character I've ever seen.  \\n\\n\r\nKillua is aweomse.  He's many peoples' favorite and is very likeable.  He underwent most of the character development in the show.  He excels in rational thinking and in being a great friend.  In the beginning he was a bit a psychotic child murderer, but he's a very very different person later on.  \\n\\n\r\nOk now, the real thing that makes the characters so good.\\n\\n\r\nThe Villans\\n\r\nI will discuss the three main villans of the show.\\n\\n\r\nHisoka is the first your introduced to.  While he's very one track minded, he's very different.  He deeply enjoys one on one fights.  He finds Gon interesting because, while weak, he believes Gon could become very strong in the future.  He likes beating the crap out of Gon so Gon can remember and fight him back later on.  This quality about Hisoka is never compromised.  Other than the aspect of him beating up the main character and acouple others, he  might as well be considered a good guy.  That's all I'll say because I don't want to spoil it.\\n\\n\r\nChrollo is my personal favorite.  He's sort of like this criminal mastermind.  He has a very special power that he uses to get a lot of power to cause havoc in major cities.  His irrational enjoyment of causing people harm is actually discussed in the show (something I've never seen).  While people your typical evil guy with many henchmen, there is one scene in the show that makes it clear why he's different.  He deeply deeply cares about the members of his gang, the Spiders.  He puts the well-being of his people above everything.  That's all I'll say about him.\\n\\n\r\nMereum is the greatest villain of all time.  Now, I did not say most evil, sinister, or smartest.  He's just the perfect combination of all these things.  This villain, underwent enormous character development and that's what sets him apart.  He had an unreasonable obsession for world domination like any bad over-powered bad guy in a shonen does.  Except this time, while he starts off that way, he does not end that way.  The shown focuses on his growth a lot and it will keep the viewer at the edge of their seat.  This is all I can say about him \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\\n\r\n No anime is perfect.  It's very had to write and direct a series, especially over 100 episodes, that doesn't fall into some plot holes, require fillers, maintains originality, keep the viewers interested, and be something we can remember for a long time.  \\n\\n\r\nFortunately Hunter x Hunter did all these without fault. It's simply a masterpiece in every sense of the word and you need to be watching it yesterday.",

            "content": "Every once in awhile you come across a show that just refuses to fade away from your memory. It stays with you in such a way that it makes you question what is it about it that made you like it so much. After a good while contemplating that fact I think I finally wrapped my head around it.\r\nStory: 9\r\nHunter x Hunter is not what you would expect after viewing the first couple of episodes. It starts out fairly generic, and by that I mean is that it may offer the ideia that it\u00b4s just another typical  shounen anime that we of the animecommunity have seen so many other times before. This, my friends, is HxH biggest fault becuase im certain that many people have turned this show away exactly because of it\u00b4s beginning, that while not bad (certanly not for me xD) may unfortunatly trick viewers to the thought that Hunter x hunter is your typical shounen anime. This however, is not the case.\\n\r\nHunter x Hunter is a breath of fresh air, a rare gem that you just dont find every day, that continuasly suprises you with it\u00b4s rich storytelling and unique settings that are capable of evocking enjoyment, anger, laughter, sadness, etc... \\n\r\nIt\u00b4s as if the show is always growing, getting more and more complex as it goes, not afraid of taking risks and exploring complex themes. This beguns to became quite aparent in the show\u00b4s third arc that is sure to real in those who are still not convinced of Hunter x Hunter ability to evoke suprise and emotional  investment. With that said I would just like to add that the Chimera Ant arc (one of the latter arcs of the story) is quite possibly one of the most endearing arcs to ever have graced the spotlight. For better or worse it will stay with you, with it\u00b4s unforgettable moments and deep layout that will surely make an impact.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\\n\r\nHunter x Hunter is comprised of 148 episodes and every single one of them is very well animated with the exception of some that are just borderline outstanding. The fact that a series this long is capable of maintaning such a great amount of consistency in it\u00b4s animation department is somewhat mindblowing and almost ilogical. Series this long require a large budget and regular maintenance of finance to keep going and to add to that, it is known that animators have a difficult life in the animation industry. Hunter x Hunter seemingly was capable to surpass all of this troubles or at least supress them as much as it could and presents us with a rich animation quality and great art esthetic.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe OST for this series is also very memorable. There is a great use of symphonic music that largely improves as the series goes on and there is good amount of variety of music trough out the show too. If there is any negatives in this category would be that sometimes there is some misusage of songs in certain scenes which sometimes dont blend well together, fortunatly the times that this occurs are few in between.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\\n\r\nA big reason to why this series is so engaging is due to it\u00b4s memorable  cast of characters.  This series showcases characters that to this day still remain one of my favorites fictional characters ever created. They are not portrayed as simply \"good\" or simply \"bad\" but simply as people who make mistakes, questionable decisions and that show complex personalities that dont faulter into a simple category because in general people cant just be labelled as such. Gon, Killua, Hisoka, Netero, Meruem, Kurapika, Chrollo, Ging and so much more... Are a simple example of the great memorable characters that this show has and that surely will stick with you.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\\n\r\nI think it\u00b4s already pretty aparent where my stance is with HxH. It\u00b4s a fantastic anime that tackels original and complex themes, with a great cast, art and soundtrack to back it up that will hopefelly leave an impact on you as it surelly did on me.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10 \\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "HxH is one of those shounen anime which are both well written and well executed.I just completed this anime so it'll be easy for me to express my thoughts(this review is completely based on my opinions,so you have all the rights to disagree with me).\r\nI wont give any major spoilers but there can be minor spoilers in my review.\r\nSTORY- 10\r\nUnlike most shounens HxH is unpredictable. Its story is not as unique as FMAB but its also not as predictable as Fairy tail or other generic shounen. Let me explain, So basically HxH is divided into 7 Arcs:\r\n1.Hunter Exam Arc\r\n2.Zoldyck Family Arc \r\n3.Heavens Arena Arc\r\n4.Yorknew CityExam Arc\\n\r\n5.Greed Island Arc\\n\r\n6.Chimera Ant Arc\\n\r\n7.13th Hunter Chairman Election Arc\\n\r\nIn the first 2-3 arcs, even though the story is good, you wont feel anything special about this anime.If you're not a shounen fan, these arcs can be a problem. But at the same time as you proceed you would realize that these arcs were important for the character development of this series.The actual fun part of this series begins from Yorknew City Exam Arc.\\n\r\nThe best Arc of this series is Chimera Ant Arc (its also one of the most well written arc I've ever seen).\\n\r\nFor me, any anime along with good story,it should have a good ending. HxH has an outstanding story and also ,even though not great but, a satisfying ending.The story continues in manga but I think the anime also ended at a good note.\\n\\n\r\nART-9\\n\r\nThe Art & Animation in this series is great. I like how the animation in the first few arcs was so light and there are not much gory scenes.But as the series proceeds the tone changes and suddenly there is more bloodshed and gore on the screen.The change of tone of animation is done so perfectly that you wont even notice.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND-8\\n\r\nThe Osts and other sound tracks of HxH is not as great as FMAB or Naruto\\n\r\nbut its good.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER-10\\n\r\nThe characters of HxH are same as most shounens, i.e.\\n\r\nWe have the main protagonist Gon Freecss who is friendly,optimistic and helpful in nature.He is strong in combat but is a weak strategist.So basically he is Naruto of HxH!!\\n\r\nThen we have Killua Zoldyck who is smart,cunning and a good strategist.He is Gon's best friend so basically you can call him Sasuke of HxH(before leaving konoha, jk!).\\n\r\nThen there are Leorio and Kurapika who are also among the good friends of Gon.\\n\r\nBut the most interesting character (what I think) is Hisoka, the main antagonist of the series. He is not the generic villian of a shounen like Frieza who just wants to defeat the hero and wants to show everyone that how powerful they are.He is like the Joker of anime who does want to defeat and kill his enemies but only if they are worthy enough. In fact there is a part in the series where he fights along side Gon for a competition. \\n\r\nThe character development of this series is magnificent! The writers gave enough time to each character as the story proceeds which eventually pays off for the series.\\n\\n\r\nTLDR: HxH is one of the best shounen anime out there with a great unpredictable Story, great Animation, decent Music and an outstanding Character development.Its a MUST WATCH.",

(Yes, even after 148 episodes.) **Spoiler Free**\r\nStory: 9\r\nThis is about a 12-year-old boy who sets out on a journey to find his father and become a Hunter like him. He's an unpolished diamond, but his character develops and refines as you continue to watch the series. There are many arcs in the story. And while my favourite is the Hunter Exam arc, the rest of the arcs still make you want to click, \"Next Episode\" repeatedly until it's 1am.At first, I thought it was a kid's show, but as you continue watching, it's definitely not for kids. It's pretty violent; don't watch it if you don't like blood.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Character: 10\\n\r\nThe art is very diverse and unique for each character. No two characters are alike. The character designs suit the characters very well. (e.g. Hisoka's character design is similar to a clown, since his power involves playing cards.) The background is just right; it's not too detailed. Each character is unique in design, and in personality. You'll fall in love with at least one of the main characters. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nI seriously loved everything. The OPs, the EDs and the soundtrack altogether.  It's perfection. It fitted in the scenes perfectly; nothing was out of place. The voice actors/actresses did an amazing job. Their voices fit the characters like a glove.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nI was so sad and hung up on HxH when I finished it. I couldn't find a new anime to watch, because I was obsessed with HxH. I usually watch shoujo animes; this shounen anime was a new genre for me. I didn't regret anything.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10",

            "content": "Hunter X Hunter, a story about a large variety of people and their exciting journeys to attain their greatest desires, some at a large cost.\r\nI cannot gush enough about how great the soundtrack and animation was in this show, so I won\u2019t. Simply know that I couldn\u2019t see any problems with either one apart from minor quirks that are easily forgiven.\r\nAt its start, the series has a faster pace and is far more about being a light-hearted adventure, using the dynamic of the four main characters and action to grab your interest. Most importantly, it knows how to use action the correct way, as itdoesn\u2019t rely on fights or gore alone to get an emotion out of you. Examples being leaps of faith into a cavern, sneaking up on dangerous opponents, trying to beat the clock, or escape from a nest of venomous vipers. Hunter X Hunter manages to be a great shounen that makes the best use it can of both tired tropes and original ideas. The show\u2019s style of storytelling changes significantly as time goes by however. Towards the ending it slows down, exploring the thoughts of the character in greater detail, adding far more narration and flowery language. It makes it seem like you\u2019re watching an animated novel rather than any ordinary series. While the narration and symbolism is used thoughtfully in the later parts of the Chimera Ant arc, the final Election arc suffers from having too much narration, telling you things rather than showing them. If you like or dislike this change is very much up to personal taste, as both ways of storytelling are used well for what they are.\\n\\n\r\nLike many shounens, HxH comes with a large cast. Some characters are focused on to a great extent, some less so. Two particular cases, Leorio and Kurapika, were presented as part of the main cast yet are left out of several arcs, leaving you wishing their stories had some closure. In the end though I can\u2019t say I wasn\u2019t satisfied with how our other main characters reached their goals. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I found most interesting about the show was the way it developed characters in the Chimera Ant arc, where some very unconventional means were used to bring about its emotional end. I raged several times as it seemed the story was taking a turn for the worse, only to see that most of those moments would have a greater meaning later on. What brings HxH to such a high score is the fact that it taught me something about writing. The one thing most shocking to an audience isn\u2019t character-death or such things, but rather extreme changes to a character. One can in fact use bad tropes to threaten a character\u2019s development, engaging the audience, making us wish to see them find their way back to their piece of heaven.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the only things that bring the show down from being perfect are the characters that were left behind, and the less exciting politics of the last arc. I\u2019d recommend it to all lovers of anime, adventure, and good writing. A must-see.",

            "content": "1. This review is very long. Though, there is a \"tl;dr\" at the very end for all my main conclusions\r\n2. I do not take animation or soundtrack into count when scoring an anime; I only weigh the story. \r\nThere comes a point in your life where you think your expectations have been met. You begin to see as an avid anime fan that if it is Shonen, ESPECIALLY if it runs in Shonen Jump, then it has been done before and will probably be done again. But this time\u2026 I\u2019m not sure I can say that anymore. There possibly never has been a journey sofulfilling, so empowering and profound as the journey of Hunter x Hunter. This was not an adventure for the characters. This was an adventure for the viewers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n---PLOT---\\n\r\nHunter x Hunter is something I didn\u2019t expect to like at all. As you can see, it appears to be a very generic, run of the mill, action shonen. But to my surprise, it successfully deconstructs that exact genre. It\u2019s a once in a lifetime experience to see such an iconic demographic be torn to shreds and reassembled in a near perfect way.\\n\\n\r\nYou can read the basic premise on MAL, so I won\u2019t explain it here. What I will explain is why you shouldn\u2019t let the seemingly generic, or even \"childish\" nature of it stop you from experiencing this thrill ride of an anime, which has the ability to trigger almost every human emotion possible. It takes the most unoriginal plot; a boy searching for his father, and turns it into something much, much more. There\u2019s practically nothing you can\u2019t find in this show. Its deep, it\u2019s entertaining, and above all, it can emotionally effect its audience better than most things these days, all while maintaining its shonen tag. \\n\\n\r\nHunter x Hunter is comprised of seven individual story arcs, and every one of them flows into the next one so naturally you barely notice the change, yet they\u2019re all still so diverse in theme and intention to where you could never confuse one arc for another. Like the title picture would suggest, they fit together like a puzzle, while still seeming to all be different genres. Despite this, the single most defining genre of Hunter x Hunter is adventure. After all, it is a journey about friendship, and it does run in Shonen Jump, the magazine where Naruto, Bleach, and Dragon Ball were and are published. Yet, it is so much more mature in every sense of the word than those three.\\n\\n\r\nIt is shonen done right, and nothing short of it. It will even bend the rules of a typical Jump title and cover extremely depressing and dark topics from time to time, (ranging from human compassion to torture) and it never fails to influence when it does. (I remember portions of the manga \u201cBakuman\u201d where the editors would constantly remind the artists that work under them, \u201cThis isn\u2019t suitable for Jump,\u201d for violence and such other gritty aspects. It just made me think of how Hunter x Hunter runs in Jump, yet is incredibly gory at times.)\\n\\n\r\nAnd then that brings us to what a shonen implies; Battles.\\n\r\nOh.\\n\r\nBoy.\\n\r\nThe entire idea behind the battles is that the characters have to use a lot of observation and strategic thinking to win them. The outcome is never that easily observed; keeping an unpredictable flow of originality in this world. The magic behind the fights is done with an ability called Nen, where the user can manipulate the life energy (aura) surrounding themselves and use it for basically any purpose whatsoever. The system that explains the ups and down of Nen is so well thought out and creative that it allows there to be very, very many different ways one can fight, and Nen doesn\u2019t even have to be used for combat. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime devotes a lot of its time to actually training its characters to become stronger, and it doesn\u2019t play around. You have to be tough to survive in Hunter x Hunter's world; if you aren\u2019t, you will most likely be picked off very quickly. (Its ridiculous how this anime treats its side characters sometimes)\\n\\n\r\nBut this is just the beginning. In order for one to learn Nen, they must be a Hunter. The primary goal, the focal point of the anime, is to become, (and better yourself as) a Hunter. A Hunter applicant must pass a rigorous examination where they\u2019re strength, endurance, experience and wisdom are all tested. If they are to pass, (and less than one in a hundred thousand do) they will become an elite member of humanity, given the right to search for magical beasts, hidden treasures, and even other people. Being a Hunter is one of the most simple, yet original premises of rank and privilege there is. You can be a literal Hunter for anything, the sky is the limit. So given that all these amazing premises are the trademark of Hunter x Hunter, it should be a given that the anime is brilliant.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, however, it does indeed go through a bit of a rough patch; the beginning doesn\u2019t really encompass the whole feel of the anime, because it delves into very depressing and dark themes rather... quickly. Not only that, but the actual quality of the arcs aren't completely level. Some arcs meander too much and end up becoming lengthy. That's not to say they don't fulfill their purpose; in fact, the one arc guilty of this actually has one of the deepest side stories in Hunter x Hunter. It's just drug out.\\n\r\n---Plot Score: -Amazing- ---\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n---CHARACTERS---\\n\r\nIf there was one thing that is nearly impossible to get right in all of fiction, particularly a weekly boy\u2019s magazine, it is the characters. But fear not; this is not the case. I can\u2019t recall a time where I\u2019ve seen characterization and character development done well in such a long span of time, and this is actually to date the longest anime I\u2019ve ever seen. But that\u2019s a good thing, because I don\u2019t think it can be topped.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character, Gon Freecss, is a kindhearted young boy who grew up surrounded by nature. He can easily befriend all forms of life and is infinitely curious. He isn\u2019t interested in judging anybody. He just wants to find his father, a world renowned Hunter. But underneath his playful exterior is a soul that will never give up: even if his life will surely end because of his actions. He will do whatever it takes, literally to the point of sacrificing his mortal body and driving himself to the point of insanity, to avenge or save a friend.His partner in crime, Killua Zoldyck, is a once lethal assassin who grew up in a very abusive home. Being constantly exposed to electric shocks and other various pain inducing devices, he decides it would be for the better of him to give up killing others, and instead become a good person with his friend Gon. Killua\u2019s character development, where we see him go from a hotheaded killer to a loving brother and self-sacrificial friend, was so amazingly written it leaves me speechless. He is my favorite character and for very good reason. \\n\\n\r\nKurapika, the third primary protagonist, is a quiet person who has an over the top hatred for the people responsible for killing his entire tribe. He belongs to the Kurta Clan, a group of people whose eyes glow bright red when angered or upset. Since their eyes stay that way after death, they are valued as one of the most beautiful things in the world and sought after in high regard. He becomes very emotional very quickly and lets anger and resentment cloud his judgment, but will still place the well-beings of his friends above his own goals. Leorio, the fourth and final primary protagonist is a seemingly greedy and unlikable man who only cares about money. This is revealed not to be the case, as his ultimate goal is to become a doctor and treat patients free of charge. After losing one of those closest to him simply because he could not afford to treat them, he cannot let that happen to anyone ever again, and will also do whatever it takes to protect his comrades.\\n\\n\r\nWith how they're used, unlike in a lot of action centered Shonen, the main characters are mostly along for the ride instead of being completely tied to the outcome of the problem they face. They're not key players, and while they influence the narrative to an extent, the entire outcome doesn't rely on them. This is such a unique plot mechanic for a story like this, and its originality is heightened by the relationships and character interactions that happen.\\n\\n\r\nWe see the characters get deconstructed emotionally as their beliefs are picked at and tested, therefore expressing the diversity and development in the cast, which is done incredibly well with not only the main characters, but also the villains. The goodness in everyone can and will sprout from even the darkest of hearts. This anime produced more favorite characters of mine than any other, and it is a shame that there isn\u2019t more room on the character favorites list for them all. I just wish that some of these characters got a little more screen time.\\n\r\n---Characters Score: -Amazing- ---\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n---ANIMATION---\\n\r\nMadhouse at their best. There isn\u2019t a better way to put it. Fights are amazingly choreographed and always extremely fluid and consistent. They must have had to devote a lot of their resources to keeping the same quality of animation throughout 148 episodes, and they sure do deliver. My only gripe would be the censorship. If one were to read the manga, one would know just how violent it can get. I wish the violence wasn\u2019t as hidden in the anime as it is but that is just a nitpick. With this aside, there really is no more to say about the animation. It never wavers; it stays crisp and clean the whole time. What could possibly go wrong?\\n\r\n---Animation Score: -Amazing- ---\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n---SOUNDTRACK---\\n\r\nThis can, unfortunately. I cannot let the problems escape from under my nose. The soundtrack isn\u2019t very great. In the first arc, the anime is highly belittled by transitions that make it seem like something intended for the younger audiences of Pokemon and other children\u2019s anime. The music is generic at best, and the only real ascent in soundtrack quality is during the sixth arc, where the disturbing themes are underlined by dramatic and suspenseful music. And just as a little note, if a character plays a piece of music with an instrument within the anime, don\u2019t use it as a background piece that you will play repeatedly; it makes the scene sound tacky.\\n\\n\r\nThough, that is just speaking for the music that plays during the runtime. The opening and ending themes are completely different stories. When you first hear the opening, it sounds HIGHLY forgettable and not at all catchy, though it doesn\u2019t take long for it to become a very iconic tune to any blossoming fan. That goes for the endings too, which are all very good in their own way, and all sound completely different too.\\n\r\n---Soundtrack Score: -Substantial- ---\\n\\n\r\nAFTER REPORT:\\n\\n\r\nPROS:\\n\r\n-\tSuccessfully deconstructs shonen clich\u00e9s\\n\r\n-\tOriginal use of characters in shonen; they\u2019re more along for the ride\\n\r\n-\tExciting character interactions and very well written development\\n\r\n-\tBattles are awesome to watch\\n\r\n-\tSeven very unique arcs with a vast quantity of interesting themes and ideas\\n\r\n-\tEye candy animation\\n\r\nMIXED:\\n\r\n-\tITS LONGGGGGG\\n\r\n-\tViolence is censored\\n\r\nCONS:\\n\r\n-\tOther \u201cmain\u201d characters are forgotten quite often\\n\r\n-\tFlat soundtrack\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: -Brilliant-\\n\r\nWhen I first caught wind of Hunter x Hunter, I heard nothing but praise. It is number three on MAL, and I couldn\u2019t fathom how on earth it was that high, hiding among the greats like Fullmetal and Steins;Gate.\\n\\n\r\nI was taking a huge risk when I started something so long, but that risk definitely paid off. This will remain to be one of my favorites, and I can only hope the mangaka gets his ass in gear so that we can get a cour two.\\n\\n\r\n10/10\\n",

            "content": "You know how everybody keeps saying that there is nothing they can say about Hunter x Hunter that hasn\u2019t been said before? Well, they\u2019re all right. While this is technically a review of Hunter x Hunter, this should probably be treated more like a memoir of my thoughts on the show. If you want a really detailed review that thoroughly dissects all of the odds and ends of Hunter x Hunter, you might as well read its most helpful MAL review.\r\nNow, what is it about Hunter x Hunter that makes it so special? At face value, there really isn\u2019t anything going on that makes itstand out. The initial conflict isn\u2019t very innovative, and for a while, it seems like it\u2019s on the same level as other shounen. It should be said that I am very familiar with long-running shounen. I have seen all of Naruto, all of Bleach, and even though it\u2019s not on my list, I have seen 20-30 episodes of Fairy Tail, 40-50 episodes of One Piece, and at least 200 episodes of Naruto Shippuuden. I\u2019ll say here that I will make lots of comparisons between Hunter x Hunter and \u201cthe big three.\u201d The reasons why Hunter x Hunter is so special among shounen, as well as anime in general, are very simple. Hunter x Hunter does things that other anime don\u2019t do. Hunter x Hunter gets things that other anime don\u2019t get. Hunter x Hunter goes places that other anime don\u2019t go. Hunter x Hunter gets what a good story is. Hunter x Hunter gets what good characters are. Hunter x Hunter gets anime, and Hunter x Hunter gets people.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I would normally start off talking about the story, I think I\u2019ll start off talking about the characters. Now, the big three have humungous supporting casts, and so does Hunter x Hunter. The thing about Hunter x Hunter is that it uses its supporting cast in a much more effective way. For example, in Bleach, there are lots of soul reaper characters that get screen time sprinkled all throughout the series. It seemed like tons of these characters got an episode or two (or three) that consisted of either filler to provide backstory, or a fight scene with a forgettable bad guy where they would monologue and/or have flashbacks while fighting. Also, One Piece dedicated entire arcs to introducing supporting cast members. I think Naruto did a much better job at integrating backstories in a way that seemed to benefit the plot, but giving backstories to every single minor character grows very tiresome. Not only do all of the minor characters of Hunter x Hunter feel meaningful, they all just kind of slip into the plot without much effort. For example, in the fourth arc of the series, a group of body guards is assigned to protect someone. At first, it just seemed like Togashi wasted his thinking juices on creative designs for characters that wouldn\u2019t make any difference in the story. By the time the arc was over, all of the guards felt important and all you really learned about them was their names. They were only in that one arc too! And later down the line when one of the characters would pop on screen for a few seconds, a lightbulb would blink in your head and you would remember them! By the way, while Hunter x Hunter does suffer from characters having monologues during fights to discuss their abilities, the problem is much less prevalent compared to the big three.    \\n\\n\r\nNext, I\u2019m going to talk a bit about the main cast, as well as some of the supporting cast members I felt stood out more. \\n\\n\r\nFirst up is Gon! Gon has a lot of characteristics you would expect from a young protagonist. He\u2019s tough and talented, but not tough enough. To protect his friends and find his father, he\u2019ll need powers that will take both work and experience to achieve. His friends and father are in fact the main things that push him. While becoming a hunter because his father was a hunter isn\u2019t the most original thing in the world, the story does a good job at keeping that plot point in play. In fact, the beginning of just about every arc has something to do with Gon taking the next step to find his daddy. The arc would then find its own shape and Gon\u2019s daddy quest would take the back seat for a bit before the next arc. I\u2019ll hit on this again later, by the way.\\n\\n\r\nNext is Killua, who in my opinion is the best character in the cast. Killua has the most fleshed out backstory out of everyone. He also has very intriguing character traits. While Gon\u2019s problems are pretty easy to deal with, Killua has a whole family of problems (ba-dum-ch). His tale is one of coming of age and learning the meaning of friendship. Also, Gon and Killua form a tag team that stays together for pretty much the entire series.\\n\\n\r\nThe other two main characters are Leorio and Kurapika, of whom I will discuss at the same time. Gon, Killua, Leorio and Kurapika form kind of a fab-four during the first arc, but after that, Leorio and Kurapika kinda part ways. They both show up in the fourth arc, where Kurapika does some badass fighting. After that, Kurapika doesn\u2019t get much more screen time while Leorio doesn\u2019t make much of a difference to the story until the last arc. Both of them are still good characters even though they don\u2019t get as much screen time as Gon and Killua, but I have one big problem with each of them. My deal with Kurapika is that his defining characteristic is his quest to avenge his clan, of which he is the lone survivor. We\u2019ve seen that before. With Leorio, it\u2019s that he probably wouldn\u2019t have gotten to be a hunter without his buddies helping him out during the exam. Still, even though we never really see him fight someone, he gets a little clip down the line that reveals he has some fighting strength. \\n\\n\r\nMy favorite supporting character would be Hisoka. He may be a \u201cbad guy,\u201d but he\u2019s the kind of bad guy you root for. His motives for his \u201cbadness\u201d are hidden for the duration of the series, but that only makes him more mysterious. Early on he takes interest in Gon because he sees his huge potential. Hisoka wants to see Gon grow up, get stronger, and then...??? Yeah, that\u2019s for you to figure out for yourself. Anyway, he still isn\u2019t the Madara Uchilla kind of villain whose goal is to enslave humanity for whatever reason. Hisoka shows up when he wants and does what he wants, only to slip back into the shadows\u2026  \\n\\n\r\nThe last character, or characters, I want to talk about is the Phantom Troupe. The Phantom Troupe have this Akatsuki thing going on with a club full of criminals. Their motives are somewhat explained. The gist is that they are an elite bunch who want to steal stuff. Why they steal what they steal is for you to discover. The troupe is a prime example of having creative characters without dedicating twenty minutes of backstory to each one. Also, they all have really cool powers that you learn about by watching them fight, rather than having them monologue about their powers to their foes. And the last reason I like them is a good bridge over to my favorite thing about the characters of Hunter x Hunter: the depth of the villains.\\n\\n\r\nI think that Hunter x Hunter has the overall best villains of any anime I\u2019ve seen. Now, I have already talked about some general things I like about Hisoka and the Phantom Troupe, but all of the villains have certain characteristics that other anime villains don\u2019t have. These characteristics are value for life and duty to one\u2019s friends. Minor spoilers coming up btw. So, there is a point in the story where a Troupe member gets killed by a main character. After that, the rest of the Troupe mourn over their lost friend. Yes, friend! One of the members actually brings up the length of their friendship with the deceased. These criminals that have killed countless people have a level of depth that I have never seen in anime villains. Another example would be in the sixth arc of the series. The main villain of that arc is as bad as they could possibly come, and even he learns to love a person that is as very weak and feeble. It should also be noted that all of the bad guys in the sixth arc have a diverse pallet of emotions that is not seen elsewhere. \\n\\n\r\nAfter talking about the characters, it\u2019s story time! I\u2019m going to give some thoughts on each arc without spoiling anything. \\n\r\nArc 1: Easily the worst in the series. Well, I guess it\u2019s not bad. It's actually kinda good. Still, everybody will tell you it\u2019s a poor representation of the show, and they are all right. I actually had to force myself through some episodes. Still, it did set up some very important characters, as well as plant a seed for the rest of the series to grow from.\\n\r\nArc 2: While it is technically an arc, it\u2019s more like a short story to develop Killua\u2019s character. It still isn\u2019t wasted time, as it gives Hunter x Hunter the push it needs to get going.\\n\r\nArc 3: This is my third favorite arc of the series. It\u2019s where we really see the world of Hunter x Hunter develop. My main reason for liking it is that it is short, sweet and it gets a lot done. Coupled with some good battle sequences, it sets the foundation for the combat abilities of the characters.\\n\r\nArc 4: It is what I think to be the best arc of the series, and many will agree. It introduces the Phantom Troupe and reveals the dark tone of Hunter x Hunter. Also, much more is at stake in this arc compared to the first three. \\n\r\nArc 5: It kind of lost me a bit. While it was certainly good, the shift in tone compared to the previous arc was a miss. It also seems to lack importance when compared to the other arcs. \\n\r\nArc 6: It is actually my fourth favorite, but many fans see it as their first favorite. All things considered, it is fantastic. However, the 61 episodes that it was left me exhausted, and there were a lot of episodes heavy on the narration side that kind of disrupted the arc\u2019s flow. Still, it\u2019s a fantastic arc with a fantastic story.\\n\r\nArc 7: This arc was my second favorite, which is good, seeing how it is the last one in the series. The tone shift from the previous arc was very refreshing, and it gave me all of the things that I needed before Hunter x Hunter ended.\\n\\n\r\nNow, about the actual story, Hunter x Hunter has a very cool way of doing things. The main conflict is Gon trying to find his dad, not that that is much of a conflict. What Hunter x Hunter does is use that as a guide for taking the characters to different places, proceeded by inventing a completely new conflict for the current setting. It\u2019s almost like watching what would be considered filler arcs in other shounen, except they\u2019re not filler arcs. The story of Hunter x Hunter had a billion directions it could have gone in, and the possibilities are still open.\\n\\n\r\nThe really great thing about Hunter x Hunter\u2019s story is that it is not afraid of taking things too far. After the first arc, it seemed like a nice and happy children\u2019s show. A couple of arcs later, the stuff on the screen had me think things like, \u201cOh\u2026crap\u2026that really just\u2026happened.\u201d I\u2019m not saying that death and darkness is what makes a story good, but a story without fear of where it\u2019s going is nothing but exciting. Also, few to none of the conflicts are solved through the power of friendship. It became clear early in the series that characters weren't able to do magic tricks and make a happy ending come out of nowhere. Knowing that pumps out lots of suspense into the air. \\n\\n\r\nTime to talk about the ending. Lots of people say the worst part of Hunter x Hunter is that it\u2019s over. I kind of agree, but I also disagree. When I look at what we got, I think what we got was good. Has the story ended in the sense that an official ending has been announced? Well, no. It\u2019s not called Hiatus x Hiatus for nothing. Still, I think if we got more, it could disrupt what is actually a pretty sound ending for a very good anime.\\n\\n\r\nTime for the boring stuff. Does it look good? Visually it isn\u2019t any different from the big three. Now, the soundtrack is very good. There are tons of tracks, and I love each one.\\n\\n\r\nSo, final verdict time. Hunter x Hunter is a huge journey. I certainly think it is worth the watch, but I would be lying if I said I\u2019m sad that it\u2019s over. I\u2019m actually very happy to get to watching something else. Despite the score and praise I give it, it won\u2019t get a very high place on my favorites because I don\u2019t see myself re-watching it for a long time. I may re-watch the fourth arc at some point, but once again, it will be a while. Still, be sure to put this on your plan-to-watch list. Hunter x Hunter is something really special, and you won\u2019t be able to understand that until you see it for yourself.\\n",

The problem in itself of this arc, is that it has few functionalities but to expand its characters and something in the world to meet with Killua, something that leaves something to be desired.\\n\\n\r\n-Heaven's Arena Arc (7.5 / 10)\\n\\n\r\nThis arc is very important, because there is a twist of nuts in Hunter x Hunter mechanics, where we understand how hunters and powers really work. His explanation is quite good and well structured, based on real religious grounds to explain the use of the aura/vital energy, but it is an arc that is somewhat monofunctional, if it were not for its importance for everything that follows it would be something poorer, but He has a lot to contribute.\\n\\n\r\n-Yorkshin City Arc (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nThis arch is even more important, and it's really good. Here the main characters and some secondary including those introduced become largely three-dimensional and we can understand even more how everything works, from here the narrative of the series improves a lot giving a very powerful message that you do not find up to 2 arcs more ahead. Those of us who believe that they are bad turn out not to be completely evil and teach the corruption and injustice of the world. The Genei Ryodan is taught as something that was born of this injustice being conformed by extremely powerful Nen users, such as Chrollo, Hisoka or Feitan. The development of characters here is very good, especially the antagonistic thing that intensifies even further ahead. Kurapika constantly changes personality and ceases to be the same person in terms of motives that were at the beginning of HxH. This arc changes protagonist constantly giving us different approaches, being something that makes the narrative is consistent and solid.\\n\\n\r\n-Greed Island Arc (5/10)\\n\\n\r\nActually the arch of Greed Island is not bad, but in comparison to the rest of the series is excessively poor and has hardly any functionalities. For the only thing that really contributes is to know something more to Ging, that Gon and Killua train to use this training in the next arc and finally used as an interlude with bad rhythm between the bow of Yorkshin and the arc of the Chimera Ants onwards , many episodes could have been compressed to have greater utility or the island's system is very well explained.\\n\\n\r\n-Chimera Ants Arc (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nContrasting with the previous arch, we have this arc, which I really do not know where to begin to explain everything it contains. This arc begins as something of dark adventure, and changes its objective to an arc of battles, to finish in a dramatic arc with a powerful message and one of the best developments of antagonists that I have seen. It is an arc that changes its structure without losing its focus, and that deconstructs a lot of aspects of the shonen of fights. Antagonists change and evolve constantly with memorable phrases. Especially Meruem, who represents absolute strength, and Komugi a blind young woman who represents exactly the opposite and how does Meruem change and evolve impeccably, respecting the weakness. Although Meruem is such a powerful individual, and put all the resources to be able to defeat him, Meruem refuses to follow this and gives us a chair that it is a good society, that it is a good king, that we have failed, or how we can evolve, all this is coupled with its relationship with Komugi, which is beautiful in all aspects, both its beginning, evolution and consolidation. Meruem is a three-dimensional antagonist, constantly changing and having memorable moments, which undoubtedly make him one of the best antagonistic characters of the anime and the best of the shonen. With Neferpitou, the second antagonist could be said, something similar happens with Meruem, constantly changing to the point of being someone different. All this leaves us in Who is really the bad guy? Is an antagonist necessarily bad? As for the protagonists, something similar happens, Gon and Killua change a lot around the bow and we manage to understand them completely. We understand the philosophy of a lot of characters that we had not managed to understand before, such as Zeno Zoldyck or the philosophy about power and stability that Isaac Netero has. The arc in the field of action is great, since without losing its epic moments, it adds seriousness, it does not abandon its rules, nor use poor plot conveniences to extend itself in the narrative development, adding artistic techniques that make the battles even better. This arc has a connection in message and in the frame with all the arcs in a subtle way without almost anyone noticing, and when you have finished you realize what is really happening, what the series really is about, and where really try to go. Things like injustice, power, friendship, or the use of power are issues that are on the table all the time. In addition to having very good music and well used, an excellent art by Madhouse that even improves in relation to manga correcting errors. Being one of the best arcs ever made, being mature being directed for an audience of minors, and being disquieting in many aspects, positioning itself in my opinion in the best arc of the shonen that I have been able to see.\\n\\n\r\n-Arc of the Election of the 13th president of the Hunters' Choice (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nThis arch is totally an epilogue. After all that happened, only the conclusion remains and that it has changed. As a normal epilogue it would be thought that it would only work in the conclusion of the previous thing, but finally we found this and much more. This arc is better than it seems, because it resolves things that remained on the air, such as the behavior of the Zoldyck family, the functioning of the hunters' association and its shortcomings, such as the conclusion of the friendship of Gon and Killua.\\n\\n\r\nWithout much more to say, the story of HxH is very good, and despite certain rather poor moments, he knows how to correct his mistakes, and certain arcs make the series assume a huge seriousness.\\n\\n\r\nArt (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nAs I said in the arc of the Chimera Ants, the manga is usually inconsistent in art quality, which Madhouse corrects with much detail and use of colors, or moments of black and white, sepia, or different filters known to extend the emotions of the characters and the moment.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nIn general, the whole section that summarizes the sound is excellent, which starts something regular and ends up being memorable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of HxH are very good, they evolve and they are mostly quite human, but something that I rescue is the good ability that the series has to develop antagonists to the point that one wants to support their reasons, as it is with Meruem. And the development of Killua and Gon ends up being such a real friendship that it is not necessary to spread in silly things like rivalries of power, they never cared about this.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoy (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion I can not say much more, 'Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood' and 'Hunter x Hunter (2011)' are considered the best shonen not for simple reasons, it is because they represent just what a series should do to a young audience to have quality, while FMAB develops it well without gaps.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9,2/10 = 9/10\\n\\n\r\n------------------\\n\\n\r\nHacer una review de HxH (2011) es demasiado dif\u00edcil por la cantidad de cosas que posee, como la trama se mueve, y cada vez que piensas a donde iba la trama, hacia donde se termina moviendo demostrando que estabas equivocado.\\n\\n\r\nHistoria (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nEl \u00fanico problema que en s\u00ed tiene la serie, es la inconsistencia de los arcos cambiando de calidad mucho rato, luego me explicar\u00e9 porqu\u00e9, pero ir\u00e9 por parte.\\n\\n\r\n-Arco de la Examen de Cazador (6/10)\\n\\n\r\nEl examen de cazador posee una buena introducci\u00f3n a sus personajes, y r\u00e1pidamente conocemos sus motivos e intenciones, adem\u00e1s de explicar de manera concisa parte de las reglas y funcionamiento del mundo, el \u00fanico problema en s\u00ed, es que el arco posee personajes que son casi de relleno y a veces es excesivamente inocente, pero tiene un buen ritmo y oscila entre lo inocente y lo oscuro con una buena habilidad, otro problema es la poca tridimensionalidad de los personajes que a veces ataca a la serie, hay veces donde los 4 protagonistas y otros poseen comportamiento bastante razonable y humano, y otro comportamiento algo mas plano.\\n\\n\r\n-Arco de la Familia Zoldyck (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nEste arco corrige en parte los errores del arco anterior, a\u00f1ade carga dram\u00e1tica a la narrativa, utilizan mejor el arte y al narrador, y podemos entender y empatizar mas con los personajes ya que muestran mas humanidad, a\u00f1adiendo que se a\u00f1aden cosas que nos muestran el funcionamiento de la sociedad de Hunter x Hunter. El problema en s\u00ed de este arco, es que tiene pocas funcionalidades mas que expandir sus personajes y en algo al mundo para reunirse con Killua, algo que deja que desear.\\n\\n\r\n-Arco de la Torre Celestial (7,5/10)\\n\\n\r\nEste arco es muy importante, porque se da un giro de tuercas en las mec\u00e1nicas de Hunter x Hunter, donde entendemos como realmente funcionan los cazadores y los poderes. Su explicaci\u00f3n es bastante buena y bien estructurada, bas\u00e1ndose en fundamentos religiosos reales para explicar el uso del aura/energ\u00eda vital, pero es un arco que es algo monofuncional, si no fuera por su importancia para todo lo que sigue ser\u00eda algo mas pobre, pero tiene mucho que aportar.\\n\\n\r\n-Arco de Yorkshin (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nEste arco es a\u00fan mas importante, y es realmente bueno. Ac\u00e1 los personajes principales y algunos secundarios incluyendo los introducidos se vuelven en gran parte tridimensionales y logramos entender a\u00fan mas como funciona todo, a partir de ac\u00e1 la narrativa de la serie mejora much\u00edsimo dando un mensaje muy potente que no te enteras hasta en 2 arcos mas adelante. Los que creemos malos resultan no ser completamente malos y ense\u00f1an la corrupci\u00f3n e injusticia del mundo. El Genei Ryodan se ense\u00f1a como algo que naci\u00f3 de esta injusticia siendo conformado por usuarios de Nen extremadamente poderosos, como lo son Chrollo, Hisoka o Feitan. El desarrollo de personajes ac\u00e1 es muy bueno, en especial el antag\u00f3nico cosa que se intensifica a\u00fan mas mas adelante. Kurapika cambia constantemente de personalidad y deja de ser la misma persona en t\u00e9rminos de motivos que era en un inicio de HxH. Este arco cambia de protagonista constantemente d\u00e1ndonos diferentes enfoques, siendo algo que hace que la narrativa sea consistente y s\u00f3lida.\\n\\n\r\n-Arco de Greed Island (5/10)\\n\\n\r\nRealmente el arco de Greed Island no es malo, pero en comparaci\u00f3n al resto de la serie es excesivamente pobre y apenas tiene funcionalidades. Para lo \u00fanico que aporta realmente es en conocer algo mas a Ging, que Gon y Killua entrenen para usar este entrenamiento en el siguiente arco y finalmente usarse como un interludio con mal ritmo entre el arco de Yorkshin y el arco de las Hormigas Quimera en adelante, muchos episodios pudieron haberse comprimido para tener mayor utilidad ni se explica muy bien el sistema de la isla.\\n\\n\r\n-Arco de las Hormigas Quimeras (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nContrastando con el arco anterior, tenemos este arco, que realmente no s\u00e9 donde empezar para explicar todo lo que contiene. Este arco empieza como algo de aventura oscura, y cambia su objetivo a un arco de batallas, para terminar en un arco dram\u00e1tico con un mensaje potente y uno de los mejores desarrollos de antagonistas que he visto. Es un arco que cambia su estructura sin perder su enfoque, y que deconstruye un mont\u00f3n de aspectos de los shonen de peleas. Los antagonistas cambian y evolucionan constantemente con frases memorables. En especial Meruem, que representa a la fuerza absoluta, y a Komugi una joven ciega que representa exactamente lo contrario y como hace que Meruem cambie y evolucione de una forma impecable, respetando la debilidad. A pesar de que Meruem sea un individuo tan poderoso, y se pongan todos los recursos para poder derrotarlo, Meruem se niega a  seguir esto y nos da c\u00e1tedra de que es una buena sociedad, que es un buen rey, en que hemos fallado, o como podemos evolucionar, todo esto se junta con su relaci\u00f3n con Komugi que es hermosa en todos los aspectos, tanto su inicio, como evoluci\u00f3n como su consolidaci\u00f3n. Meruem es un antagonista tridimensional, que cambia constantemente y tiene momentos memorables, que sin dudas lo convierten en uno de los mejores personajes antag\u00f3nicos del anime y el mejor de los shonen. Con Neferpitou, el segundo antagonista podr\u00eda decirse, sucede algo parecido que con Meruem, cambia constantemente al punto de ser alguien diferente. Todo esto nos deja en \u00bfQuien es realmente el malo? \u00bfAcaso un antagonista es necesariamente malo? En cuanto a los protagonistas, sucede algo parecido, Gon y Killua cambian mucho alrededor del arco y logramos entenderlos totalmente. Entendemos la filosof\u00eda de un mont\u00f3n de personajes que no hab\u00edamos logrado entender antes, como ser\u00eda el caso de Zeno Zoldyck o la filosof\u00eda sobre el poder y la estabilidad que tiene Isaac Netero. El arco en el \u00e1mbito de acci\u00f3n es estupendo, ya que sin perder sus momentos \u00e9picos, a\u00f1ade seriedad, no abandona sus reglas, ni utiliza conveniencias argumentales pobres para extenderse en el desarrollo narrativo, sumando t\u00e9cnicas art\u00edsticas que hacen que las batallas sean a\u00fan mejor. Este arco tiene una conexi\u00f3n en mensaje y en la trama con todos los arcos de una forma sutil sin que casi nadie lo note, y cuando lo hayas terminado te das cuenta de lo que realmente est\u00e1 pasando, de que realmente trata la serie, y a donde realmente trata de ir. Cosas como la injusticia, el poder, la amistad, o el uso del poder son temas que est\u00e1n en la mesa todo el tiempo. Adem\u00e1s de tener m\u00fasica muy buena y bien utilizada, un arte excelente por parte de Madhouse que incluso mejora en relaci\u00f3n al manga corrigiendo los errores. Siendo uno de los mejores arcos jam\u00e1s hechos, siendo maduro estando dirigido para un p\u00fablico de menores de edad, y siendo descolocante en muchos aspectos, posicion\u00e1ndose a mi parecer en el mejor arco de los shonen que he podido ver.\\n\\n\r\n-Arco de la elecci\u00f3n del 13vo presidente de la Elecci\u00f3n de Cazadores (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nEste arco es totalmente un ep\u00edlogo. Luego de todo lo sucedido, solo queda la conclusi\u00f3n y que ha cambiado. Como un ep\u00edlogo normal se pensar\u00eda que trabajar\u00eda solamente en la conclusi\u00f3n de lo anterior, pero finalmente nos encontramos esto y bastante mas. Este arco es mejor de lo que parece, porque resuelve cosas que quedaron al aire, como el comportamiento de la familia Zoldyck, el funcionamiento de la asociaci\u00f3n de cazadores y sus falencias, como la conclusi\u00f3n de la amistad de Gon y Killua.\\n\\n\r\nSin mucho mas que decir, la historia de HxH es muy buena, y a pesar de ciertos momentos algo pobres, sabe corregir sus errores, y ciertos arcos hacen que la serie asuma una seriedad enorme.\\n\\n\r\nArte (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nComo dije en el arco de las Hormigas Quimera, el manga suele ser incosistente en calidad del arte, cosa que Madhouse corrige con mucho detallismo y uso de colores, o momentos de blanco y negro, sepia, o diferentes filtros conocidos para extender las emociones de los personajes y el momento.\\n\\n\r\nSonido (9/10) \\n\\n\r\nEn general todo el apartado que resume al sonido es excelente, que empieza algo regular y termina siendo memorable.\\n\\n\r\nPersonajes (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nLos personajes de HxH son muy buenos, evolucionan y son en mayor parte bastante humanos, pero algo que rescato es la buena habilidad que tiene la serie de desarrollar antagonistas al punto de que uno quiere apoyar sus razones, como es con Meruem. Y el desarrollo de Killua y Gon termina siendo una amistad tan real que no es necesario extenderse en cosas tontas como rivalidades de poder, es ellos nunca les import\u00f3 esto.\\n\\n\r\nDisfrute (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nEn conclusi\u00f3n no puedo decir mucho mas, 'Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood' y 'Hunter x Hunter (2011)' se consideran los mejores shonen no por razones simples, es porque representan justamente lo que debe hacer una serie dirigida a un p\u00fablico joven para tener calidad, mientras que FMAB lo desarrolla bien sin huecos, HxH lo deconstruye y te deja otra idea con un mensaje excelente.\\n\\n\r\nTotal: 9,2/10 = 9/10",

            "content": "There is nothing quite like HxH when it comes to story-telling. The anime is divided into around 6 arcs, each with their own unique narrative structure and cast of relevant characters. Yet while these arcs might seem disjoint and vastly different in terms of tone and atmosphere, they all connect into one amazing adventure through which characters grow, develop and learn more about the world around them.\r\nWhile the show finds its strength in the diversity and versatility of its world, it also focused entirely on its characters and the interactions between them; there were many times in the show where an antagonist or side characterwould feel just as, if not even more, compelling as Gon or Killua. I, and many others, would go so far as to say the show shines through its stellar antagonists. From Hisoka to Chrollo to Meruem himself, each antagonist is something never quite seen before--both within the show itself and among fictional works.\\n\\n\r\nGranted, the show is a shounen and will rely on some shounen tropes. Gon and Killua are exceptionally strong main characters with vast potential; Hisoka enjoys the thrill of fighting and loves fighting strong opponents; certain character developments (no specifics to avoid spoilers) can be attributed to many other similar developments in other works as well. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, HxH shines in its execution of these tropes and its subversion of expectations. Gon and Killua might be strong, but they lose more often than they win; the show does an exceptional job in organically having them grow as fighters, but also making sure they don't get the special 'OP protagonist' treatment many other shounen suffer from. Hisoka might just be a guy who likes to fight, but he is portrayed more so as a hedonist and even a parallel to Gon in terms of self-indulgence and selfishess.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the developments I made mention of might be some that have already been done, but the execution of these developments in HxH distinguishes the series as a gold standard of character development and personification. In the CAA, for example, two characters go through major development that not only fit thematically into the arc, but also juxtapose each other; more over, one of these characters' overall development flows naturally with his character progression throughout the entire series itself.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWe've talked about the superb story and characters, but if that's not enough to get you watching this riveting tale then I hope the well-fleshed out power system and amazing production value will. Going off the former point, Nen is perhaps the most consistent, nuanced power system to date. It models aspects of real life, such as:\\n\\n\r\n- jack of all trades, master of none\\n\r\n- risk vs returns (high risk for high returns)\\n\r\n- people being fundamentally different and excelling in different areas\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I thought would be a problem is that Nen seems TOO diverse and versatile. Powerups could possibly come up as random, making fights seem contrived because how can two people engage in combat when they have such different skills?\\n\\n\r\nWell, HxH fixes that problem fairly quickly. While characters have certain special abilities, those aren't the only abilities they have. Nen can be used in a myriad of ways, and there are techniques to enhance the body or senses using Nen; as such, someone with a disadvantage in terms of ability can still win if they use Nen effectively and efficiently. Because of this, Nen battles don't resort to randomness for an outcome; it's all about planning, experience and strategy. \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I feel HxH does well is its focus primarily on story with fights serving as a catalyst for development. It doesn't feel like a linear battle shounen where a fight takes up 10-20 episodes; fights come up when necessary and offer the needed stimulation, but the show holds its own by being a story and character driven tale taking place in dynamic environments. This works wonders because the pace, for the most part, is snappy and allows a viewer to feel engaged.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the production value of HxH is hands-down the best of any long-running shounen. For a 148 episode series released weekly, Madhouse surpassed all expectations. The quality only goes UP throughout the years, and really never dropped in any single episode. The studio focused more on good direction, choreography and shots instead of just throwing money at the screen. There of course are clear differences between fight quality with, say, the end fights of certain arcs vs more trivial battles within arcs, but even then the latter sorts of fights are still well done and engaging nonetheless.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I'd have to rate HxH a 10/10 no questions. The story is phenomenal, offering a wide take on themes while presenting everchanging scenarios and environments while still maintaining the core of the story: an adventure tale through which our characters meet other equally-motivated people and have their motivations intertwine and then diverge as both sides change in palpable ways. The characters are incredible and probably the strongest aspect of this show. And the art, sound, animation, basically the entire production value is stellar and still holds a candle to anime coming out in 2018, despite having aired in 2011 onwards. \\n\\n\r\nDespite being a 10/10 though, there are some nitpicks and issues I had with the show, but they aren't necessarily anything that should hamper you from watching it:\\n\\n\r\n- I liked the first arc but it can be a drag to get through\\n\r\n- The narrator in the CAA can get egregiously invasive, luckily this only happened during a short bout of episodes. And given the CAA is most likely the best anime arc I've seen, tied with the Golden Age in Berserk, I didn't find this a fatal flaw.\\n\r\n- Greed Island's villain is noticeably lacking in quality compared to the antagonists of the other arcs. He's not bad, but for a Hunter villain he's really disappointing.\\n\r\n- The story ends on a somewhat conclusive note but there are obvious plot-lines hanging in the air. Togashi is still writing the manga but due to the hiatus it'll take a decade or two for all these threads to resolve.\\n\\n\r\nOnce again, none of these flaws are show-breaking and I think no show is flawless. This is definitely something you should see in your lifetime.",

            "content": "I'm gonna keep this as short as possible, I avoided this series because it didn't seem like something id enjoy but popularity and the overall rating from the myanimelist community made me attempt to watch it and i loved the series. This series is Loved by many and hated by some who think its overrated but it isn't not at all but here is the review.\r\nThe story you can read the synopsis on it but basically it is the main character a young boy named Gon trying to look for his father and find out why he abandoned him and became a hunter instead oftaking care of him this is creates a long journey and has many obstacles spanning through the 148 episodes you see so much stuff in terms of everything adding to the story the journey, the path the development of everything just blows your mind by the end of the series because you see just how amazing everything was. It also shows friendship can truly conquer all.\\n\\n\r\nArt- Great although it kinda has the \"big eyes\" kinda thing that i hate in anime its very good i mean madhouse was one of the producers so that's enough to tell ya its great in terms of art, animation and overall everything. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nSound- Great although i don't really pay attention when it comes to sound,music etc. 148 episodes really make the music get into your head, Hunter X Hunter has a great OST a lively opening and a great ending along with very good voice acting spanning for all characters even the minor ones in each individual story arc overall 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- Every character spanning through main and minor have a story within individual story arcs and it is a great sight to watch also it has many many characters so its expected to find some great development through many of them which you do get.

            "content": "HUNTER X HUNTER: Why Gon\u2019s character is so appealing and How Fathers Are a Factor.\r\n[MINOR SPOILERS] APPLY\r\nThis is an analysis comparing like shounen to Hunter x Hunter and its main protagonist to the protagonists of these like shounen. I will not include One Piece or Bleach in this article since my knowledge of both is limited.\r\nYou know it: dads with unknown whereabouts, the popular training/arena arcs, deus ex machinas, main characters with exponential power growth, etcetera.\r\nShows like Fairy Tail and Naruto among others share these common traits. However, one show\u2019s got them beat. That\u2019s Hunter X Hunter.\r\nFor those of you who have not seen it,Hunter X Hunter is about a boy named Gon who wants to become a Hunter, like his father, who he is obsessively interested in but has never met. A Hunter is a person who conducts different kinds of research, to put it vaguely. Each Hunter has different goals. Some search for rare treasures, to put an end to rare curses, and more. They explore and affront the mysterious which in the day to day most are ignorant of. Gon is one of these Hunters. His goal is to search for his dad.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnd this doesn\u2019t sound uncommon, right? There\u2019s always shrouds of mystery over the fathers of shounen protagonists. There are the dragons in Fairy Tail, the Fourth Hokage in Naruto, and I\u2019ve never watched past episode 20 of Dragon Ball, but who is Goku\u2019s dad anyway? Regardless, there is a mystery surrounding these protagonists that is seemingly necessary for the development of our heroes. To know their background is to know them in a richer, more intimate way. These shows constantly broach the question, until it answers it, \u201chow did dad pave the path for [insert shounen character].\u201d This question focuses on the path, but really, what occurs in regard to this question is a development which makes the character\u2019s further development dependent on finding dad. This means dad becomes the primary means for anything to happen with our character. So our focus is now filtered through dad. Why? Because it\u2019s all thanks to dad:\\n\\n\r\nDad made me a dragon slayer. Dad put the Nine-Tails inside me. That\u2019s why I\u2019m special. That\u2019s why I have to find him. I need to learn more. What happened to dad? I need to find out.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow the matter on our hands concerns how dad affects [insert shounen character\u2019s] existence. The original question then unconsciously becomes, \u201chow has dad shaped [insert shounen character] by paving the path for him?\u201d instead of focusing on the path itself.\\n\\n\r\nGon defies the necessitation for his development and identity to filter through his dad. In order to address why this is so, we first must address Gon\u2019s development.\\n\\n\r\nHe has a strong sniffer. He has a lot of patience when it comes to fishing, fishing being a form of hunting many Hunters partake in, I should mention. These qualities come in handy. So Gon is special in his own way. He has two good traits to go on. Everyone has a good trait or two. But, unlike other shounen protagonists, he\u2019s NOT MADE special. He\u2019s not from a different planet with Super Man like strengths. He possesses no powers at the onset of his journey like Natsu. He doesn\u2019t have the Nine-Tails in him like Naruto. Gon is weak.\\n\\n\r\nGon starts out as literally a regular boy. His weapon in the first fifth of the series is a fishing rod for Christ\u2019s sake. So, he\u2019s a regular boy by all means. Like shounen protagonists, Gon is kinda dumb with a heart of gold, and eventually becomes super powerful. However, Gon\u2019s ability to become powerful is the result of the environment he grew up in rather than what he was imbued with by his father. He grew up close to wilderness. Gon\u2019s from the boonies. He loves animals and nature. He\u2019s ignorant like a country boy who didn\u2019t grow up in the city, but unlike a city dweller, he\u2019s resourceful. And that\u2019s how he is throughout the show. Yes, like Naruto and young Goku, much of how he reacts to situations is very much dictated by his innocent and unprepared personality, but unlike them his only card against obstacles is his expansive repertory of experience from living off the land. Again, he has no special power or background. He\u2019s just a regular kid. It\u2019s not until later on that he discovers and begins learning how to use Nen: one\u2019s life aura which can be used in combat, healing, or anything else normal to bizzarre you can imagine.\\n\\n\r\nFor me to further reach those who remain skeptical about Gon being unique, even more special than other shounen protagonists, Ging should be addressed now.\\n\\n\r\nNow, Gon nor the show itself may seem unique due to the \u201clike father like son\u201d dynamic of shounen obviously being part of Hunter X Hunter, nor does he seem initially all that different from his father. Gon grew up in the same environment as his Ging. One could say the same for Naruto, but Gon unlike him has the choice to become a Hunter, regardless of the circumstance, without pre-destiny. Naruto doesn\u2019t have a choice as to whether he will become a shinobi, and I don\u2019t know what I should say about Goku. I suppose he has a choice too. However, considering what we know about Dragon Ball, more specifically Dragon Ball Z, we know that Goku is much needed to combat the threats that face him and the world. This is untrue of Gon. Gon is definitely not a needed character throughout Hunter X Hunter. Sure, he\u2019s a vital component in defeating one of the king\u2019s three royal guard during the Chimera Ant Arc, but it\u2019s easy enough to image someone else who is much stronger taking on that role. He could have simply chosen to not become a Hunter, but we wouldn\u2019t have the same show. So, it comes down to choice. Gon always has choices. His father merely gave him one path he could optionally follow: not one chosen by destiny.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnd while it\u2019s true that Hunter X Hunter hasn't finished serializing, it is with doubtful prescience one could foresee Gon becoming the most powerful Nen user to the point he\u2019s the only one capable of tackling obstacles. After all, that was the point of the Chimera Ant Arc. Hunter Chairman Netero, the strongest human Nen user, couldn\u2019t even defeat the primary foe with his skills alone. No one\u2019s so powerful nothing can be done by others.\\n\\n\r\nGon becomes extremely powerful, but it is with determination and intent, not a Nine-Tails beast inside him or having the genetic superiority of some space monkey. And, we come to find out in the show, many Nen users have some condition which must be met in order to use their powers. It\u2019s not necessarily that a power has a separate counter-balance like kryptonite; rather, the user affects himself through his own use of power. If he doesn\u2019t meet his own condition to use it, or even if he meets a certain condition to exchange with something of equal value, the ensuing danger or consequence is his alone to take on. We see this when Gon changes (which I will intentionally say so vaguely), and when Netero uses Zero hand.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhat we know about Togashi, the creator of Hunter X Hunter, is that he really only utilizes the teamwork dynamic. Nothing can ever be accomplished without a buddy, which is what makes Gon so special. Naruto may also rely on his team, but Shippuuden comes to a point where he\u2019s so powerful, everyone else would just get in the way, besides Sasuke. Even then, the two don\u2019t need each other in combat. Each is more than capable of handling a problem himself. What makes Gon interesting is he needs his best friend, Killua, as a foil, otherwise, without the balance of character, he might just become annoying over time as Naruto does which many fans complain about.\\n\\n\r\nSasuke acts as a foil to Naruto, sure, but like I said, Naruto can be imagined off on his own without Sasuke. Gon, on the other hand, needs Killua to save his ass more than a handful of times, whether that\u2019s in a physical fight, mental breakdown or anything other. Both are the shoulder the other leans upon. Hunter X Hunter would become boring without this dynamic. I\u2019ll stress again: Naruto and Goku can handle pretty much everything themselves come a certain point. This is absolutely, indubitably untrue for Gon. When he\u2019s not with Killua, he nearly dies every time, and in the end, he would just become a boring character.\\n\\n\r\nLike his shounen protagonist peers, he has a propensity for selfishness and heroicism when it comes to saving others, which reflects a certain careless optimism paired with a desire to win that costs him dearly in many parts of the series, especially the final fifth of the show. Obviously, most times, it is when Killua is not with him.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis becomes especially apparent during one part of the Chimera Ant Arc. Gon admits how \u201cfrustrating weakness [is]\u201d. Even then, Gon continues to struggle through this mentality which gets him nearly killed. He may have the spirit of Naruto and Natsu, but neither character comes nearly as close to death as Gon. For both, positive attitudes are seldom met by dire consequences which cannot be countered and overcome. Nor do we ever see Naruto and Natsu address any overwhelming feelings of defeat. They\u2019re always the \u201cyes-man\u201d backbone of hope. Gon is too, in a way, but he can\u2019t always be right about the outcome of things. No one can. This is what Naruto and Fairy Tail fail to realize. Once Gon realizes he\u2019s wrong about a tomorrow he thinks he\u2019ll see, his ego breaks down and he has no idea what to do. This is when he becomes irredeemably reckless, and accepts death. This is when the show conveys that one\u2019s own actions come at a high price: something else Naruto nor Fairy Tail seem quite able to capture, for the premise of both shows rests upon the principle there will always be a better tomorrow, or a certain future, something untrue for Hunter X Hunter come the Chimera Ant Arc.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that makes Gon especially interesting is that there is more than one side to him. As mentioned, he becomes a reckless character, and this brings out all kinds of dark and previously untapped thoughts that make his delve into the foray that much more enticing and gut-wrenching. He says things and acts in a certain way that, hitherto, has been completely unexpected. Throughout the first three-fifths of the show, you get to know him, and you think you know him, but then he encounters irredeemable loss and an irrepressible anger that he manifests into the climax of the show which serves as an antithesis to the Gon we meet at the beginning on Whale Island and the Gon we see during the height of his power while he\u2019s at his lowest low mentally, emotionally and morally.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s the first time he\u2019s frighteningly serious, his optimism all but diminished. This is what is expected, naturally, of shounen characters like Naruto. They maintain the same mental space throughout their encounters when everyone else loses it. Gon loses it while his resolve and will become stronger. This is a concept very unique to a shounen protagonist. I believe Togashi is the first to separate the will and resolve from the unperturbed state of the ego. Gon is definitely more than perturbed. This leaves the audience wondering on what scale Gon could achieve such a spectacle of recklessness. We are granted that spectacle. You\u2019ll have to watch the show to find out if you haven\u2019t experienced this yourself.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nUnlike other shounen shows, everything in Hunter X Hunter (2011) up to the end of the Chimera Ant Arc is Gon\u2019s training arc. This is all in preparation to find his father. It\u2019s unclear whether Ging has plans for Gon, but more than likely, Gon will choose his own path even after finding his own father. I speak from the point the show ends, not the Dark Continent nor successive arcs which continue after in the manga. Even if he does team up with his old man for a while, it\u2019s unlikely he\u2019ll stick around long. Gon will want to forge his own path. Gon\u2019s purpose was after all just to meet Ging. It\u2019s clear why Togashi is having issues writing the manga. Togashi knows Gon will have to develop without relying on his father because of his development thus far not having relied on his father. This brings us back to the first point, which is that Gon is able to achieve his successes on his own, so we don\u2019t need his background to know him in a richer or more intimate way.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, it seems Ging is contrasted more than compared to Gon, because it\u2019s clear they are separate and different from each other when introduced in the last arc of the anime series. Togashi has had Gon forge his own path and it would feel like a waste if Gon\u2019s character suddenly relied on someone else. Besides, there is no connection holding neither Ging nor Gon together.\\n\\n\r\nWe\u2019ll have to wait to see what Togashi holds in store for us",

            "content": "First off, this review has spoilers.\r\nHxH was the second shounen I've ever seen. I initially watched it because I got so many recommendations saying this was the \"model shounen\" and that it was really good, albeit long.\r\nAfter taking about a month to finish this show, I can confirm the statements that it is a very good show. You've probably read many reviews going over its, pros, so in this review I'll try to highlight some cons I felt as well.\r\nI'm going to be completely honest and say that the statement: \"HxH gets better as it goes\" is crap. Also, I really believe the chimera antarc is overhyped. You know that one arc everyone seems to drool over? It's also the longest one in the whole show, stretching about 50 episodes if I'm not mistaken. \\n\\n\r\nIf I were to give the ratings across each arc in the story, I would give it as follows:\\n\\n\r\nHunter Exam 10/10\\n\r\nZoldyck Family 10/10\\n\r\nHeavens Arena 8/10\\n\r\nYorknew City 9/10\\n\r\nGreed Island 10/10\\n\r\nChimera Ant 8/10 \\n\r\nChariman Election 6/10\\n\\n\r\nI think HxH started off with a bang. I was instantly addicted, and for the first two arcs, I couldn't stop watching. You get introduced to the energetic Gon, scheming Leorio, and thoughtful Kurapika, and they just seem to conquer everything in front of them. Then we meet Killua, who seems to mesh really well with the trio. He has his own problems eventually get solved due to the tight friendship they all share. There goes the first two arcs.\\n\\n\r\nHowever once I reached Heavens Arena arc, I feel like it kinda slowed down. I wasn't as hyped up to watch the next epsiode due to the fact that Kurapika and Leorio had left. Also, it kinda seemed pointless. There was no reason they were there other than to earn money and to train, but there just didn't seem to be the same intensity of an end goal that the first two arcs contained. However, I think the fight scenes in Heavens Arena were very well made and it served as a really good way to demonstrate how Gon and Killua trained for their powers, as well as develop Hisoka as a character.\\n\\n\r\nThen comes Yorknew. Yorknew City was also a good arc in my opinion. The duo of Gon and Killua once against meet Leorio, and in this arc we are introduced to the Spiders, who seem unbeatable at first but slowly, the main characters whittle down the resistance and eventually Kurapika gets his revenge. I thought this was very well made, because Kurapika doesn't kill all of them. He gets his revenge in a very subtle way, which I think is clever on the part of the writers. One thing I didn't like however, was that it seemed a little overhyped for what it delivered. For isntance, Kurapika makes a deal with Hisoka to give information, in exchange for information. However, Hisoka doesn't really do anything during this arc. I was expecting a lot more out of this \"deal\" but nothing really occurred and it kinda disappointed me.\\n\\n\r\nNow for my favorite arc, Greed Island. I love how its almost a present from Ging to Gon, and the game itself kinda represents that pure hunter spirit, where Gon learns more about why Ging wanted to become a hunter. I loved the action scenes and the whole issue with the Bomber, (and also how Gon defeats him). Also, who doesn't like Bisky? Not much to be said about this one, its just so unique compared to all the other arcs and very well done.\\n\\n\r\nNow comes Chimera Ant. I felt like the buildup was very well done, with the queen slowly creating more and more dangerous creatures until we have these powerful monsters that are masters of Nen. I liked that. However, I don't like how in this arc we are delayed for such a long time. I think the arc could have been 20 episodes shorter had all the scenes in which nothing important happened got removed. For instance, there was a moment I could remember where I was watching 5 episodes in a row and all of them were just Gon's group sitting outside Meruem's castle, waiting for a moment to get in, which obviously was very boring to watch.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, why can't Kurapika and Leorio get in on this arc in some way? They are main characters right? Like I don't hate Knuckle or Palm or Shoot, but I feel like in this arc they introduced way too many new characters instead of developing the ones that we have already spent so much time with. And all these new characters were only developed shallowly, instead of only a few characters being developed very well.\\n\\n\r\nBut I do like how the arc ends, and how there isn't just a clear happy ending. \\n\\n\r\nFinally, Chariman Election. Man this was just confusing. I really don't like how they just spat out the existence of Alluka like we as viewers were supposed to notice that the first time. Then all of a sudden, Gon is magically healed for no reason other than that Alluka just happened to exist in the world. I really don't like it when anime does this, when there's just a magical factor that solves everything for no reason. This was my main issue with the last arc, also I felt like the chariman election was a little confusing, with its funky system and the new characters that are introduced for no reason whatsoever. The whole time while watching this arc, I was just wondering when Gon would finally meet Ging, and how Kurapika and Leorio were doing. Honestly I feel like this arc could've just been removed, the show is better without it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, my main issue with the show is that it develops these 4 main characters so well in the first half, but fails to deliver on that promise by completely neglecting two of them (Kurapika and Leorio) and instead introducing so many irrelevant minor characters that personally as a viewer, I don't care about. Like to put it into perspective, the last time a viewer saw Kurapika, who by the way was my favorite character, was in Yorknew City. Like, the 3rd out of 7 arcs. And you call him a main character? Same with Leorio, if we don't count the few moments we see him in the last arc. It just sucks that two out of the four characters aren't really there for half the show, and are instead replaced with random characters that come out of nowhere. Like, instead of having Knuckle and Shoot fight with Gon and Killua during the Chimera Ant arc, how sick would it be to have those two be Kurapika and Leorio? Like there would just be this feeling of continuity that the show seems to miss when it focuses for so long on only Gon and Killua.\\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, still would recommend. Like I said, I focused a little bit more on the cons since you've probably heard lots of the pros. HxH is long, but its worth a shot especially if you like this genre. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading!",

It kicks off the story with a boy named gon, and it goes to introduce the characters and the setting in the first 5 episodes. Now of course, the main character Gon is the focus in this arc, but it also introduces you to the other main 4 characters. Killua, Kurapika and Leorio. Killua becomes Gon's best friend almost immediately and Gon becomes good friends with Leorio and Kurapika. Now they all take the hunter exam to become Hunters ofthe Hunter Association. To be a hunter is to be one of a kind strong. Not just anyone passes the hunter exam, you got to be exceptionally talented and have great potential. All of them have their own reasons to join the Hunter Exam but Gon's reason is to find his father, since his father abandoned him as a baby to become a hunter.\\n\\n\r\nArc 2: Zoldyck Family Arc is where you meet the rest of Killua's family, since they play a MASSIVE role in this universe. I won't get into it too much but his family is pretty nutty just like Killua. They're all pro hunters themselves. Great premise and definitely some heartwarming moments in this arc.\\n\\n\r\nArc 3: Heaven's Arena Arc is where it focuses on Gon and Killua, as they try to find a means to pass time and make some quick cash. Heaven's Arena is literally just a 200+ floor battle tower. Lots of fights and a few decent Hunters reside inside. Gon and Killua get a new trainer too. Imagine the World Martial Arts Tournament in Dragon Ball but BIGGER. Lots of getting pumped up in this arc, good fights and stuff. Osu!\\n\\n\r\nArc 4: Yorknew City Arc. This arc has to be #2 best arc in this anime. It is so meticulously crafted that it will leave you hanging on to the edge of your seat the entire time. Amazing fights, amazing plot line and such. This arc re-introduces Kurapika as the protagonist and focus with Gon, Killua and Leorio as the side characters. I love this arc personally. It's dark, raw, gritty and is fitting. If you like criminal underworld and mass genocide, you'll like this arc. That's all I'll say.\\n\\n\r\nArc 5: Greed Island Arc. This arc brings the focus back to Gon and Killua and puts them inside a game world called Greed Island, a game developed by Gon's Dad, who gon thinks his dad left clues to his location. They go inside but immediately encounter all sorts of trouble from thieves, to murderers. They run around and do quests and train with a new trainer in this arc. It's almost a light hearted arc with a small dark undertone. Imagine World of Warcraft if it was focused on collecting cards but had full PvP enabled.\\n\\n\r\nArc 6: Chimera Ant Arc. I won't delve too deep into this arc, as this is the arc you must watch. If you're going to give Hunter x Hunter a shot, atleast watch all the way through til this arc. You can ask literally ANYONE and they will say 10/10. This arc follows Gon and Killua after the events of Greed Island. It is a horrifying dark arc for an almost lighthearted anime but this will change your perspective on anime forever. Gon and Killua find a new trainer and Gon looks up to this new trainer almost as if he's an uncle or best friend. This is the peak of the anime. It has the best storyline out of all the arcs, out of all the animes thus far. It has lightheartedness but be prepared to cry. A lot. I know I did. 10/10 #1 Arc\\n\\n\r\nArc 7: Election Arc. The final arc to conclude the anime. This wraps up the entire mess that has happened in all the arcs preceding. This arc mainly follows Killua as well as a few others. It's a crazy yet super heartwarming arc and everything about this arc wrapping everything up is so perfect. The perfect conclusion. This arc makes this anime rewatchable so many times.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10.\\n\r\nArt: 10/10. It's good for being a 2011 Anime and I don't see how they could improve it at all.\\n\r\nSound 9/10. It has many memorable tracks and tracks that fit the mood at that moment perfectly. From dark, creeping feelings, to Successful wins, from seeing someone with God-like power, to personifying a character in music. Also the Jap subs are the way to go. Grade A. Don't watch in the english dub because the english voice actors DO NOT fit the character voices.\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10. The character development and pacing is amazing. If a part in the story needs you to wait a month or so without you doing anything, they'll either timeskip or just start a new arc, as seen in the Heaven's Arena Arc. They don't mess around with the pacing and only show backstory for the really important bits. (Don't worry, this isn't naruto, you're not gunna see that swing 300 times.)\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10. I love gon as a character, and Killua is the perfect match for him. I love every other character too, even the repulsive ones because everything is thought out so intricately that no gaps are left in the story and you can really enjoy any character. For side characters that you never get to see, I love this ninja named Hanzo, a girl who is a bee keeper named Ponzu and of course Gon's Dad along with a few enemies.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: This anime is worth watching, and rewatching. I finished it back in December of 2017 and I still can't stop talking about it.\\n\r\nHunter x Hunter king of animes.\\n",

            "content": "This is my first time writing a review for an anime.\r\nI know that there are 80 million other reviews out there that are better than mine but I still want to put my thoughts about this show for everyone to read :)\r\nI\u2019m pretty new in the anime community, so my apologies if my opinions don\u2019t go with what you think based on my lack of anime knowledge. I\u2019ll get better I swear!\r\nAlso, I\u2019m not gonna waste time talking about the synopsis of this show; MAL has written a pretty good one for you already. Make sure you read it ;)\r\nIntro: This show can be comparedto that one kid in school who\u2019s not known by a lot of people, but once you get to know him/her, it changes you. This show is not like the other Shonen out there, simply because its popularity stays on the DL. But that\u2019s what makes this show unique; it\u2019s a hidden gem just waiting to be polished (*cough* *cough* BRISKY *cough*). I\u2019m glad that this will be the first anime I\u2019ve ever done a review on, so here we go!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: You easily get emotionally attached to the characters. It\u2019s pretty hard to name a character in the show that you truly hate because once you learn about their story and past, then you see the reasons for why their personality is the way it is. The characters all have a different way of thinking, and because of this, you\u2019re able to gather more information about the storyline and plot development. The relationships between the characters all vary and are never the same from when they first meet. This allows the viewer to really see the character development happening. You also see some character development physically (especially with Gon like WOAH DUDE). Long story short, the characters are a lot of fun and figuring out their different personalities is even more fun. ~10/10~\\n\\n\r\nArt: I\u2019m not so familiar with art styles and how they vary throughout anime, so I'll keep it short and compare it to what I\u2019ve seen so far. The colors and shadows that are used go very well with the ambiance of the show and its Arcs. The fight scenes are always animated to its best and never fails to go downhill after every episode. Just like one MAL reviewer said (Cresherhsm), it\u2019s shocking how this show aired for so long, yet it kept up the solid animations and fighting scenes all the way until the end. The simple art allows the viewer to really focus on the show while still getting enjoyable animation. ~10/10~\\n\\n\r\nMusic/Sound: The music in HxH is beautifully written and really brings everything together. The intro/outro music starts off strong and gets even better after every new Arc. It\u2019s upbeat, fun, and really brings out the Shonen feel of the show. The soundtrack throughout the show is amazing, and it never fails to have a song that goes great with what\u2019s happening. There are some parts during the show where they could\u2019ve used a different song to really capture the moment, but other than that, the music really goes great with the show. ~9/10~\\n\\n\r\nViewer Experience: I had SO much fun watching this show. The way each episode ended really makes you want to keep going and further the story. If you get emotionally attached to a show (guilty) then you\u2019ll have many emotions going through you while watching, like happiness, anger, sadness, and that \u201cfeel good\u201d sensation that really makes you more positive minded. HxH does everything it can to give you new information, and that\u2019s really helpful when it comes to seeing the real deep meaning of the show. The way Togashi wrote HxH is far beyond from what I've seen with basically anything. They did an exceptional job at forming the Arcs and distributing the information only at times when they wanted you to know about it.\\n\\n\r\nThis show also keeps you thinking and making guesses at what happens next. All the fights that happen during the show are heavy on strategic thinking and the characters always seem to have the mindset that they are 2-3 steps ahead (when they really aren\u2019t lol). HxH never fails to make you think and predict the next outcome, especially with the battles. ~10/10~\\n\\n\r\nNegatives: I believe that this show is perfect and does not have any major negatives. But with such a perfect show like this, the only way to get some negatives is to be really picky about the show and find its minute imperfections.\\n\r\n- The beginning of the show really doesn\u2019t set a good scene for what actually happens during the show. The first few episodes make the show seems like a typical Shonen where the adventures are gonna be fun and everything will work out for the protagonist when realistically, it\u2019s the exact opposite. There\u2019s a lot more to the show, and it has a really deeper meaning than you think, so once you get past the first few episodes, (honestly, once you get past the Hunter Exam Arc) then the show really shows its true colors.\\n\r\n- The sounds during the show sometimes don\u2019t fit well with what\u2019s happening. But this detail is very small, and it doesn\u2019t distract you from your overall experience. Just, in my opinion, there just could've been better sound selections at some parts.\\n\r\n- The pace of the anime sometimes slows down and gets mediocre in the writing. This can be seen in the beginning of the Chimera Ant Arc. This could just be a little mistake, and Togashi just didn\u2019t take their time at that one section to fine tune. However, this is a pretty noticeable difference if you\u2019re super focused on the show. There are some episodes scattered here and there where the writing and/or its pace isn\u2019t its usual best, but once again, it doesn\u2019t take away from your overall experience.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Opinion: With my \u201camateur anime knowledge opinion\u201d, the only thing I can really say is... invest your time in this show. This show is an easy one to marathon (I did it in under a month while still having school work!) and it\u2019s most definitely worth your attention. The times staying up all night and avoiding homework were really, really, REALLY worth it and I don\u2019t regret anything. I went into this without reading the manga or watching the 1999 original, and I still managed to understand everything happening.\\n\\n\r\nWhile this is a review written by a rookie in 2017, where are thousands of other titles that have recently been released,  I don\u2019t think any other Shonen can top this one or will ever be able to top it. It\u2019s super unique and everything about it is just fantastic.\\n\\n\r\nFavorite Character(s): Kurapika, Killua\\n\r\nFavorite Quote: \u201cI do not fear death, I fear only that my rage will fade over time.\u201d ~Kurapika\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10 (Amazing personalities)\\n\r\nArt: 10/10 (Beautiful)\\n\r\nMusic/Sound: 9/10 (Great but misused at parts)\\n\r\nViewer Experience: 10/10 (Incredible and worth your time)\\n\r\nOVERALL: 10/10 (Masterpiece)\\n\\n\r\nI hope I did pretty good on my first review! :D Feel free to tell me how I did and how I can get better moving forward :)\\n",

            "content": "At this period of time, the shonen genre has become a difficult demographic to recommend to experienced anime fans, due to increasingly unoriginal stories and recycled concepts being rampant among the shonen demographic, leading for many people to dismiss it as an overly repetitive, stagnant genre with a few gems in between.\r\nClassics within the demographic suffer from another core problem; while an excellent portion of the classic shonen demographic are truly fantastic series within their own right, the demographic suffers from those classics not holding up in the current time among modern yet experienced anime fans.\r\nWhy is all of the above relevant?\r\nWhy you ask? BecauseHunter X Hunter is an example of a classic shonen that does much more right than wrong, and withstands the test of time to this day as a classic example of how purely amazing a shonen can be.\\n\\n\r\nHunter X Hunter is one of the most carefully written, if not the most carefully written shonen to date. The story-line is fast-paced at the beginning, but slowly gains this careful pacing that most shonen series, in particular long-running ones, lack. The fights are carefully written from start to finish, and the way the protagonists or their opponents manage to defeat each other never feels poorly explained with deus ex machina moments in between, unlike more recent shonen classics which are filled to the brim with these kind of moments that anger non-shonen enthusiasts. If you think the series will explain it's concepts in long, drawn-out dialogue, you're wrong again. The dialogue in this series is full of wit and tries to explain the various concepts and themes it presents bit by bit rather than explain things all at once.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork for Hunter X Hunter is nothing like other series we've seen. Despite being rather old, Hunter X Hunter's art looks very different and pleasing to the eyes, with characters, their costumes and the world they're in being drawn with such vivid detail that most shonen can only dream of having. The fight scenes are very very well animation, and studio MADHOUSE seem to have taken it upon themselves to give this series an excellent budget, as the animation looks absolutely gorgeous, with very few still frames and bringing the series to life with some very detailed backgrounds.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST is very well composed, though not on the same level as the previous version of Hunter X Hunter. The calm, soothing soundtrack of the previous version is replaced with a more hardcore rock soundtrack. While not as good, the OST is nevertheless very well executed, and perfectly fits the tone of the series. The OST never feels out of place, and the right tracks are played at the right time.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the same cannot be said for the opening and the various endings of the series, which are more hit and miss more than anything else.\\n\\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, they're still very pleasant to listen to, it's just that some of the endings don't fit the tone of the arc shown at the time. The opening, while great, didn't change throughout the show. Not like I mind, mind you, just that I think we can do with a bit more variety.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice-acting is the shining aspect of the sound aspect, as the voice actors have done a fantastic job bringing their characters to life. None of the voice acting or roles assigned feel out of place, and while this series may be over the top in it's acting sometimes, it's still bloody fantastic.\\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, this series still receives a well above average score for sound.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters at the beginning fit into their generic archetypes, but later those archetypes are deconstructed and reconstructed in what slowly but surely becomes a fascinating character study of morals. The series isn't afraid of taking risks, and goes into boundaries that most shonen don't dare approach. The characters develop because of the plot, yet the development doesn't feel forced or unnecessary and the characters are still independent enough to feel that they don't develop because the plot dictates it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd most importantly, try not to judge this series' characters based on their appearances. An important theme of this series is breaking stereotypes about other people's appearances, and this series utilizes that theme to maximum effect, so be prepared to be surprised by some of the characters you meet. So yeah, no complaints whatsoever here.\\n\\n\r\nThe series is adrenaline pumping but has it's character-driven moments, amusing at times and dark at others, and has wit in it's dialogue that the shonen demographic desperately needs at a time like this in the state that it's become. I cannot recommend this highly enough.",

            "content": "**Since it has been some time since my first Hunter x Hunter review, I was keen on re-writing it with my current opinion on the matter**\r\nShonen anime tend to be generic. It's a commom fact. The demographic close itself to innovation years ago by always trying to resolve around the same themes and storylines. 90% of all shonen titles end up as only being enjoyable. However, the remainig 10% is made up with engaging and memorable shows. These shows could be done by making a few modifications in the formula or, better, a complete lack of the strict formula. This one can be discribed bythe former. Hunter x Hunter, although being an unfinished series, is probably the second best shonen ever done, being FMAB the first. \\n\\n\r\nStory - 7\\n\r\nThe story of a lad named Gon who desires to become a hunter in order to find his Dad, who holds the title of one of the best Hunters in the world.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the story goes, I can say that, even while being an unfinished plot, HxH holds itself pretty well for 148 episodes. The transitions between arcs are smooth and almost never forced. It keeps the feel of constant adventure throughout the series and a remarkable freshness from having so much diversity in each arc. The world building is incredible. Every new place breaths of life that is slowly and calmly introduced. The fights are intense, necessary and rather original since they use complex strategies rather than mindless physical brawl, unlike the average shonen title. The Nen energy is also one of the most complex shonen powers to date. Coming with various restrictions and conditions, it opens and closes horizons to new plot possibilities, while always respecting its rules (excusing its outcomes). \\n\\n\r\nIn regard of the story arcs:\\n\r\n(5.5) The Hunter exam/Zoldyck arc is simple yet entertaining. It introduces the cast, the world, the rules and the hunter association. It shows some creativity but lacks in complexity. The same can be said about the Heaven's Arena arc but with special emphasis on Nen's introduction and the Gon vs Hisoka match.  \\n\\n\r\nThe best arcs are the Yorknew (7.5) and Chimera Ant (9) arcs. \\n\\n\r\nIn YN, Gon and Killua trying to find and buy the legendary game, Greed Island, while Kurapika is chasing after the Phantom Troupe, the criminal gang who killed his clan. \\n\\n\r\nIn CA, Gon and Killua join a disciple of Ging, Kite, in order to find clues about Gon's father, but recent strange happenings on the Chimera ants species led these three into a dangerous misson. \\n\\n\r\nBoth arcs show one of the best strenghts of HxH. Its villains. The villains in HxH are a great opposition for our heroes as well as being interesting characters with clear (or at least explained) motivations. In both arcs the stakes are clearly higher as the opposition is ready to kill without any hesitation. The darker parts of the HxH world are also introduced. Being the whole mafia setting and Meteor city in YN and NGLs drug traffic in CA. These could have been used for theme exploration but were only used for flavour. \\n\\n\r\nYN is violent, intense and thrilling. CA is all that and more but for the let down of some, its pacing tends to get slower and the atmosphere groes darker. CA is heavy on its characters psychological state and on character development. It shows how love and hatred are just two sides of the same coin. The cheerful Gon becomes mad furious by holding grudges, while the deadly Meruem becomes more human than ever, thanks to Komugis love. This arc lives for the ''humans vs ants'' contrast. This contrast makes this arc shine inside the shonen genre by posing the question: \"Who is the real villain? The threatheing ants or the self-destructive humans?\" while making thought-provoking comparisons between both species.\\n\\n\r\nThe worst of the bunch are the Greed Island (5) and the Election (4) arcs.\\n\\n\r\nGI consists on Gon and Killua being sent to a virtual reality in order to get clues about Gon's father. One of GIs goals was to show the Nen exorcists and apply it on Chrollo who was at a disavantage at the time and seeked for help. However it is never shown in the arc or in the long run. The rest of the arc is traning and fighting which ends in finding Gon's father...or not. \\n\\n\r\nThe Election arc resolves around politics existing only to buy time. While, Killua is working on healing Gon by seeking help from his younger OP brother, the next Chairman Election, where Ging has came to fullfil duty, is taking place. They go nowhere with it until Gon is fully recovered thanks to Killua's half asspulled younger brother, who was being held prisioner by his family for being so OP. \\n\\n\r\nHxH's main problem tho is to never give an ending to the loose threads it creates. There are lots of them and, as far as the anime goes, most of them are yet to be clarified. Some of the doubts one would like to be shown in the series may never be brought up again and that just leaves huge potencial left in the corner. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 8\\n\r\nThe main cast is decently characterized, being Leorio and Killua the most detailed ones. Gon is shown as the most simple character, acting as the friendly, light-hearted protagonist but acknowledging his flaws and wanting to overcome them. He does have an interesting dark development in the CA arc but it goes nowhere in the long run. Kurapika may reveal himself as a interesting character, the voice of the group during the exam and while he has an overblown backstory, it justifies his goal. The problem is that, with time, he dwells too deep in his own dark goal, losing most of his personality, and becoming a revenge driven only character. Leorio and Killua both have enough of backdrop, flaws, skills, internal and external struggles shown for them to have well founded personality. Killua gets the best main character prize tho, as his presence and development leads to him having his morals and goals change, thanks to Gon. Both Leorio and Kuripika lose their presence over the course the series. \\n\\n\r\nSecondary characters also are finely done as well. They have simple well defined backdrops, interesting goals and good presence. \\n\\n\r\nThe cast may be well characterized but the spotlight goes to the villains. While Bomber is just a two dimensional jerk made to fill the antagonist role in the GI arc and Illumi is a plain plot device, Chrollo and Hisoka are shown as amazing filling their role throughout the story. Their endering and mysterious behavior is one of the main hooks of the series. Meruem is a different kind of villian. He is presented as one, but plot progression makes him change 180\u00b0. \\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation - 8\\n\r\nThere is consistency, flow and few recycled shots. It held up its phenomenal animation on the course of 100+ episodes. It could be called the pinnacle of consistency, however, it is true that some character desings are pure cringe-worthy material and feel disconnected with the place they are found in. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 7\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is fitting with the atmosphere of the series. For every mood, there is a corresponding song, and almost none of them are recycled insert songs. However, sometimes the soundtrack used just doesn't fit with the scene on-screen, and although this was just an early problem, later removed of the series, it would still make some scenes rather disonant. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Score - (7.5) \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, HxH has two great story arcs and while the other feel rather simple and unimportant, they never become boring. The fights are complex and original. The characters, as well as the setting, feel alive, non-stoping and memorable. Even if still incomplete, the anime ends on a decent note and is easily one of the best shonen.",

            "content": "\u201cQualification isn't something we have to talk about. The ones who are not okay with their success can go through training until they are.\u201d - Gon Freecss\r\nTo me, Hunter x Hunter (2011) is one of the most enjoying animes I've watched in quite a while. For an anime that essentially has it all, the lack of popularity surrounding it leaves me quite wistful. Though this may be the case, those who've had the opportunity to watch it, like me, have most certainly been able to enjoy it to its utmost extent. Hunter x Hunter (2011) is most definitely one of the greatest Shounens to eversurface the Earth.\\n\\n\r\nFirst off is the story. Since you've already read the synopsis, I'll tell you this. Hunter x Hunter is definitely not what you'd expect from its summary. This anime had far exceeded my expectations the first time I'd watched it. HxH is compromised of 7 total arcs, all in which are extremely well-written and is one of the greatest aspects of this anime. The start of the anime may seem mundane at first, but picks up very fast. Each of the arcs are highly impressive, and shift from one to the next like a chain reaction. This in turn gives HxH its great depth and flow, that which you don't see as much in most Shounens.\\n\\n\r\nThe story progression in HxH is practically non-stop. Aside from two recap episodes, there are no fillers in the anime. The series gives its viewers a wide opportunity to many different environments and appeals. From survival, fighting tournaments, mafia and crime, virtual reality, humanoids, to war and politics, HxH offers countless stories that surprisingly shift easily from one to another. As each arc is practically unpredictable, you'll never get bored from the show. I myself, who had just recently finished it, watched the whole series within less than a week. \\n\\n\r\nThe more you watch of Hunter x Hunter, the faster you start to realize that its concepts and writing are more than just child's play. In actuality, HxH is at times exceedingly dark, with heavy atmosphere and dreary developments. The emotions and deaths of characters at times like these will leave you quite literally bawling. But with the dark moods always comes the happy-go-lucky rays of sunshine. These times in the series honestly left me happy that I finished the anime because Hunter x Hunter just wouldn't be the same without them. There isn't a single moment in the anime you'd want to miss.\\n\\n\r\nMoving aside, we have the anime's art. Its art and animation is completely outstanding. No once while I was watching it could I point out a single mishap. For a long running Shounen anime with 148 episodes, it holds highly for keeping its great animation throughout the whole series. The quality of Hunter x Hunter from episode to episode gives it its own unique charm, especially the quality animation of its fight scenes. Background, character animation, show of emotion, lighting, and everything else is quite simply flawless.\\n\\n\r\nNext we have the sound. As for this, the HxH soundtrack is quite fitted for the series. Each scene is perfectly fitted with its corresponding ost. Besides a few minor characters, the voice acting of the anime is well befitting. You'd never think that the characters' voices weren't their original.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, we have our characters. If there is one thing I would need to emphasize, its this. The number of characters in HxH is huge, but they all have their own personalities, quirks, opinions, and ambitions. And in all of it, the characters don't follow the universal character stereotypes. When it comes to character development, Hunter x Hunter is second to none. All characters are virtually unique, and its almost impossible to hate any of them.\\n\\n\r\nThe four main characters, Gon, Killua, Kurapika, and Leorio, are at first pulled together in the beginning of the anime for one reason: to become Hunters. But they all do this for their own means, and are never all together for any long period of time. Although people argue that the two main characters are essentially Gon and Killua, there are almost whole arcs at times where they are not the center focus. And the dismemberment of the group can be agitating at times, not knowing when you'll get to see another again.\\n\\n\r\nBut the distinctiveness of characters in Hunter x Hunter not only come from the main characters, but also from the villains. Each villain in HxH is well-developed with interesting attributes unique only to them. Never will you see villains quite as good or even remotely like Hisoka, Chrollo, and Meruem. Their characterizations are impressive and original, and are compelling in their own unique ways. They are in no means non-threatening though, as the anime clearly shows how treacherous and merciless they can be.\\n\\n\r\nAltogether, Hunter x Hunter (2011) is a masterpiece. There are potentially no downsides. Although there is a point later in the chimera ant arc that shifts heavily into narration. But this is meant to increase psychological suspense, and allows viewers to read more into certain characters' thoughts and actions. And this adds on to HxH's uniqueness, as it widely differs from typical Shounens who are mainly focused on \"epic fight scenes\" that will last for episodes at a time. HxH does a great job in its fighting aspect, and characters at most times must use strategy rather than brute force to defeat their opponents. While most fights will only last for minutes at a time, the story in HxH makes up for all of it. Hunter x Hunter (2011) is a fantastic anime that sets itself apart from all other anime in its genre. This series definitely deserves the rating it holds, as it will send you on an unpredictable, savoring adventure.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Rating:\\n\r\nStory: 10/10 (Outstanding)\\n\r\nArt: 10/10 (Outstanding)\\n\r\nSound: 9/10 (Great)\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10 (Outstanding)\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10 (Limitless)\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10 (Masterpiece)\\n",

            "content": "(Spoilers incoming) Just to preface this, I never thought I'd have a favorite anime until I watched Hunter X Hunter. \r\nStory: 10/10. HxH pulls off the most versatile plots I've ever seen. In one arc, we'll be immersed in a tournament arc watching Gon and Killua developing their powers throughout interesting battles. In another, we'll have a high intensity crime thriller where Kurapika chases down an intriguing band of thieves for revenge. Or, we'll just be thrown into a high stakes war between humanity and a band of mutant creatures, the Chimera Ants; yet while we might expect a showcase of battles and war, wealso get a masterful handling of themes dealing with the nature of humanity, mixed with some of the greatest character development in fictional history.\\n\\n\r\nWhile HxH's arcs seem to be disjoint from one another in purpose and focus, they all serve to enhance our characters and their motivations, as well as introduce equally intriguing and relevant characters along the way. No one character steals the spotlight for all of HxH; rather, the world of HxH is the true star, and the characters, albeit interesting forces in their own right, also serve as catalysts to introduce us to the amazing situations and challenges within the world itself. HxH manages to reinvent itself with every arc, while still maintaining a firm grasp on what it wants to be.\\n\\n\r\nIt should be said that the battle system underlying HxH, Nen, is perhaps the most structured and consistent battle system in shonen. Many shonen suffer from the problems of no tangible power ceiling or power creep, thereby losing a sense of how strong its characters are as the series progresses and not presenting enough tension within a situation, i.e. if a stronger opponent comes, all you need to do is punch harder and acquire more energy to win. HxH's Nen system turns battles into a test of cunning, strategy and wit, where victory relies on what abilities you have and how you use them rather than how hard you can kick or throw an energy blast. As one of the characters puts it himself, it's foolish to think you know who'll win in a battle among Nen users, because such a battle relies more on just physical prowess.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, HxH is probably the most original shonen to date, subverting our expectations of shonen tropes. Togashi most definitely adheres to the philosophy that \"It's all about the journey, not the destination\". Admittedly, each arc ends in a rather anticlimactic way, so much so we end up asking \"What was all that for?\". Yet that's exactly the point; what we expected we wanted to see wasn't necessarily what made the experience. The journey we took to get there, the people we met, the characters that grew along the way; all of that is what truly mattered at the end, and Togashi masterfully showcases this sentiment in HxH.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10. For a long running shonen, HxH is simply phenomenal. It offers the most consistent, high quality animation and artwork in every episode. There was never a dip in quality, and every fight was of the highest calibre. Madhouse really outdid themselves here.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10. HxH exhibits one of the greatest soundtracks to date in modern anime. Each arc has its own set of OSTs, and the OSTs range from reminiscent of classical opera to high-intensity, thrilling action music. The voice acting in HxH is also phenomenal, featuring a versatile cast that are known for many other big roles.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10. Aside from the interesting situations and environments we encounter, the characters themselves are perhaps the strongest element within the show. Most characters in HxH offer something new and refreshing to the show, without adhering to the typical shonen stereotypes. What is truly great about these characters, however, is how organic and realistic they are; whenever they act, it doesn't feel like they're by-the-book shonen characters doing the same thing countless other such characters have done before. for example, Gon might try to protect his friends and save others, but he'll just as easily threaten someone's life to get what he wants; he isn't like other protagonists we've seen, where he forgives an enemy just because he's the 'good guy'. Togashi shows us that his characters are people like us, and they can't uphold an idealistic worldview in every situation they face. \\n\\n\r\nWhere Togashi shines the most is in his crafting of his villains, and let me tell you, the antagonists in HxH are some of the best I've seen in anime to date. Meruem, my favorite anime villain of all time, represents a gold standard for character development in terms of one who transforms from a sadistic animal to a being that exhibits humanity; Hisoka is a being of pure unpredictability and intrigue, a bizarre entity that can be either friend or foe, and thereby keeps the audience on their toes unable to guess what he'll do next; Chrollo is a rather reserved yet determined man, putting forth a strong philosophy of the Spider while not knowing what he truly wants (and his powers reflect this, as he steals the abilities of others, perhaps in an attempt to find himself?). Of course, not every villain in HxH is this profound (Genthru, for instance, isn't a bad villain but he's a pretty stereotypical variant of the sadistic psychopath), but most of the antagonists in HxH will intrigue you, even more so than the 'heroes' of the show. While our heroes offer complexity to the narrative, the villains just as much serve to complement our heroes and offer a novel take on the themes present within the arc. Meruem, for instance, parallels Gon's own journey through the CAA, and both characters together really showcase the potential of humanity to cause great destruction and great evolution. There is a symbiosis between the character's own development and the progression of the arcs, and it's safe to say a character at the start of an arc won't necessarily be the same person he was at the end of that same arc.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10. From start to finish, I enjoyed HxH immensely. The first few episodes do little to showcase how brilliant the anime becomes, and although I might be one of the few who actually enjoyed the first arc, after episode 30 or so, it's pretty hard to not be interested in the events that ensue as new elements are added to the story and the narrative transitions from its initially bright overtones to a more dark, yet intriguing atmosphere. Each arc also offers something novel within, from the arc's plot to the characters introduced, to how the already established characters grow and develop. \\n\\n\r\nAn especially important point to commend HxH for is in how protagonists don't gain special treatment just because they're special characters in the show. Many times, we see Gon and Killua face defeat, and even by the end of HxH, they aren't even comparable to some of the upper mid-tier to high-tier hunters. Because of this, we never know when Gon and Killua will face defeat, and when they do, it makes for an incredible potential for growth and development (especially in the CAA). \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10. HxH is a must-watch for shonen fans, one of the few anime that isn't afraid to break traditional stereotypes to showcase something new and different. From the heroes to the villains, from being a show about exciting fights and great powers to a show delving into mature themes and ideas, HxH excels in every degree. This isn't to say the show isn't without flaws; as mentioned before, the first arc is perhaps the weakest of the whole show. Also, the Chimera Ant Arc has caused quite a stir among those who've watched the show. Many consider this arc the best shonen has to offer, but some put it down due to its slower style pacing and less action, more introspection take on things. To each their own, but I think it's important to say HxH doesn't try to be a generic shonen, and that's what makes it truly special; within the CAA, we see Togashi try to subvert our expectations of battle shonen by blending the lines between 'good' and 'bad', and crafting villains that change along with our heroes, such that the arc is perhaps a literary achievement in developing characters and situations in an organic, novel way. \\n\\n\r\nWhen you finish HxH, you'll be left wanting more, and unfortunately, this might not happen. Togashi is known for taking very long hiatuses, and although the current arc in the manga has the potential to be one of the best HxH has to offer, it's not certain that it'll be finished any time soon. Yet with what we have, I can say for certain HxH offers more than enough to stand out as one of the best of its time, a thrilling adventure focused not only on being the best shonen it can be, but also a heartwarming, fascinating tale of heroes, villains, and the intriguing world of Hunters. The show itself puts forth a quote that explains the HxH experience perfectly:\\n\\n\\n\r\n\u201cYou should enjoy the little detours to the fullest. Because that's where you'll find the things more important than what you want.\u201d \\n\\n\\n",

I remember back then when i strated HxH i went in with my Mind being complwtly open and having no expectations. Also the cover looked like its gonna be this kids show but oh boy i was so wrong i got so much more. it was unbelievable that such a story like HxH exists. After 3 episodes i was hooked and so immersed. I couldnt  take my eyes from the screen. i couldnt stop watching. I fell in love at that point. The way togashi displays his storyis so unique. Each arc is vastly different from eachother. 1st we have a exam arc than rescue arc, than tournament arc, than L.A. Noire auction arc and so on.\\n\r\nJust to name some. There is no other show that does this. Also HxH has hands down the best combat system.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is the driving force behind HxH. Every Character gets well characterised. All of our 4 main cast has  Motivation as to why they do what they do. Which makes them likeable and relatable. There are lots of amazing characters in here. Also the dynamic between our main 4 is great.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSome episodes had stellar animation. Very fluid and smooth. in each arc the overall tone changes from dark to lighthearted. Also HxH has lots of colorful visuals. They fights are very well animated. so pleasing to the eye.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe opening that played through the whole show got burned in to my soul. Also the ost is very good. There are lots of amazing pieces. The voice acting is superb.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed every arc of HxH. It had alot to offer.After watching HxH i got a better understanding of what a good anime or show in general. HxH made me think in ways i never thought i would. it had a lasting impression on me.\\n\r\nI loved every little piece of HXH from the bottom of  my heart. \\n\r\nThank you.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:9.6=10/10",

            "content": "IDK how this series didn't receive more attention!!! Despite the anime's seemingly childish appearance and its young cast of characters, DO NOT BE DECEIVED, for Hunter x Hunter is one of the greatest shounen anime series I've ever seen. As with most animes in the shounen genre, Hunter x Hunter is centered on the  theme of the main protagonist overcoming challenges and obtaining god-like abilities and strength to fulfill his/her ultimate dream. But that's as cliche as Hunter x Hunter gets.  It has an unpredictable and interesting cast of characters, some of which are my all-time favorites, because most of them are notwhat they seem to be. For instance, Hisoka is one of the most unorthodox and fascinating--but not really evil--antagonist you'll ever see. Although at times the main character, Gon, does come off as overly optimistic, unlike other notorious shonen characters (including Naruto & Ichigo Kurosaki) Gon actually achieves maturity and develops a real depth in character. Also, to top it off the anime only has 2 (YES ONLY TWO) filler/re-cap episodes!!! In conclusion, Hunter x Hunter is definitely a breath of fresh air and not for one moment of the 148 episodes was I not entertained. I highly recommend Hunter x Hunter to all anime and manga lovers!!!",

I whole-heartedly recommend it to anyone and everyone who reads this review!\r\n STORY- the story of Hunter x Hunter 2011 is very good because it has amazing fast pacing for the majority of the show without feeling rushed whatsoever. You will feel like you are on a roller coaster ride with the quick progression of the main characters and the twists and turns of the plot! That is why I give the story a 10.\r\n CHARACTETRS- By the time you finish it, you will think back on the grand journey of Gon,Killua, Kurapica, and Leorio and just be in complete awe at how much they have changed, developed, matured and improved in skill. They change and go through so much together throughout the series that I have no choice but to give the character development a 10.\\n\r\n SOUND- This category is more up to personal preference, but I can say that in my opinion, Hunter x Hunter 2011 has an overall great soundtrack. I absolutely love the opening and most of the endings. Endings five and six are probably in my top 10 ending songs of all time. The iconic opening is very good and upbeat which gets you excited for the episode. The only downside to the opening is that although the opening is great, they never change it as the series goes on. As well as all these other things, The soundtrack is exceptional. The only reason why I give the sound a 9 is because the opening is the same and the soundtrack is good not perfect. It is very close to the perfection of a 10.\\n\r\n ART- The art and animation in Hunter x Hunter 2011 is executed very well. The movements are smooth and fluent and the artstyle looks very nice and colorful but can be very dark at other times (ex: Chimera Ant Arc)\\n\\n\r\n THE RESULT- Overall I give Hunter x Hunter 2011 a 10/10 this anime has truly been amazing, I fully enjoyed every second of it.",

            "content": "This review includes spoilers, so read at your own risk.\r\nIf one were to ask what a perfect shonen anime looks like, Hunter x Hunter might be the closest they would ever find. It is the pinnacle of story elements fused with artistic elements to tell a narrative.\r\nStory: The story starts off fairly simple, a boy wants to become a Hunter by completing a rigorous exam to find his father. However, on the way, he encounters a variety of detours and blocks that he must overcome should he ever want to complete his goal. Togashi perfectly weaves these together so that   the story isrelevant but doesn't seem too focused to the point where variety is lost. Examples would be the Zoldyck and Yorknew City arcs where the ex-assassin Killua and revenge-driven Kurapika respectively are the concentrations in the arc, and Gon must play his part in their stories, as they play in his own. Another part of Hunter x Hunter that is clever is the way each arc is connected to the previous and next. At times, an story takes a \"random adventures\" approach where the characters go on random adventures which may become irrelevant to the overall story unless they foreshadow something, and hinder plot progression. However, Hunter x Hunter doesn't waste time doing this; instead, each arc is relevant to the story and without it, the story is crippled. Something else that Hunter x Hunter does quite unconventionally is the change in power levels. Generally, as the plot progresses, the strength of characters increase in ascending order. In Hunter x Hunter, the power levels fluctuate as the plot goes on, meaning that even though all the antagonists are generally stronger than Gon is, the levels go something like \"overwhelmingly strong to strong to god strong\" rather than just \"strong, overwhelmingly strong, god strong.\" The battles are unique in Hunter x Hunter; they use a lot of strategy, tactics, and mental power rather than brute force and raw skills. Even a character in the series notes that technique overshadows raw power. When it comes to themes, Hunter x Hunter perfectly emphasizes them without being to explicit until the very end. An example would be the Chimera Ant arc, where the central theme was that humanity was the greatest monster of all. It was subtly pointed to throughout the arc, as the Chimera Ants were corrupted by their human genes, and at the end, it was more explicit, when Netero used the Rose and it is even stated itself. The anime ended on a note that was appropriate and settled the story.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is flawless in the Hunter x Hunter 2011 anime. Characters are drawn in proportion and detailed; unlike its manga counterpart at times. The backgrounds are amazing and the objects are placed accurately within the space. What is most intriguing is that the colours are generally bright which gives the series a happy-go-lucky feel to it at first, but then as the story goes on, the atmosphere becomes darker, but the colours generally remain the same, but it doesn't distract the viewer from the emotions evoked by the story, which is difficult to accomplish, but Madhouse pulled it off.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The soundtrack in Hunter x Hunter is amazing. To begin, there is such a variety of soundtracks that evoke each mood in the anime from happiness to sadness to fear to suspense. The soundtrack does not have a constant mood throughout the pieces, but rather the moods change as the settings change, and eventually, as the characters change. The OP is the same throughout the series, which can get repetitive, but the lyrics are altered for the sequence of arcs. This is made up for, however, by the EDs, which are catchy and generally represent the themes of the arcs in which they are played. The voice actors are appropriate for each character, and they really stand out at times when they need to, like Knov's mental breakdown and Gon's outrage. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters in Hunter x Hunter are phenomenal and are what give the story its essence. To begin, there is a variety of characters from the happy-go-lucky Gon to the vengeful Kurapika. It helps the show avoid being repetitive and predictable. What is interesting in Hunter x Hunter is the dimension that is being added to these characters, and this helps them avoid looking cliche and purely archetypal. Kurapika, despite being revenge-driven cares deeply for his friends and doesn't want to involve them in his dangerous, personal mission. He acts as a voice of reason and rationality in the group, preventing conflicts from escalating. At the same time, whenever he is around the Phantom Troupe, it is up to the other characters to be a voice of reason and rationality, to prevent HIM from escalating conflicts. Another person would be Hisoka. Hisoka, the whimsical magician, has an odd pleasure for Gon and fantasizes about killing him, but strangely enough, he comes to help Gon out whenever he most needs it. In terms of character development, Hunter x Hunter takes the cake. This was most prominent in the Chimera Ant arc. The central antagonist, Meruem, starts off as a violent character, believing that the world belongs to him and himself only, and that he is the epitome of strength. However, after meeting a blind girl named Komugi who can outsmart him, he ponders on the true meaning of strength and his own identity. It goes to the point that at the climactic battle of the arc with him and Netero, he tries to reason things out whereas Netero demands a fight. Komugi on the other hand, goes from overly humble and self-deprecating, to confident and self-valuing. Gon himself takes a change from cheerful and naive about pain to being unable to contain it himself.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I have enjoyed this series for the reasons stated above, and it's a shame it cannot be continued due to the tendencies of the manga. It is near-perfect.",

            "content": "It's really hard to call something perfect. Everything has it's flaws, and in the end it depends on your decision to overlook them or to glare at them and refuse to acknowledge that it's pretty close to a masterpiece. But screw all that, because you can count the flaws in this anime on the fingers on one hand. And that's damn impressive considering that this show is a shonen and has 148 episodes. \r\nStory: 10\r\nIf you read the synopsis, you should quickly forget about it. The story is way more than just a fun little adventure series. It goes deeper and deeper with every keyevent, every arc, and in the end you don't even know what to think anymore. It has so many life lessons, that are so amazingly portrayed that you might be left wondering about your entire existence. You just have to give it a few episodes before it gets there, and while it's not there everything else should keep you well entertained, including some great comedy here and there. Not to mention that every single arc could be it's own anime, but they are all very wisely connected. And the ending, which is incredibly important for a good shonen, is great as well.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 9\\n\r\nIt holds strong. Considering the length of the show, the animation is so amazingly consistent, never failing to deliver. I personally have some issues with a few character designs, but overall everything looks great. From the sea and the grass to the treetops and the sky everything is handled with so much care that it's simply astonishing.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 10\\n\r\nOne of the best anime soundtracks out there. It always knows how it wants you to feel and portrays it through the amazing music. It ranges from happy and uplifting, to straight up disturbing and creepy. Also worth mentioning is the opening, showcasing the feeling of adventure, which is really strong in this anime, and unforgettable endings, which showcase individual arcs. Overall incredibly memorable and towards the end you will find youself smiling when you hear certain themes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\r\nEasily the best part of the show. It doesn't matter if the character is good or evil. You either love to love them or love to hate them. With one exception of course (*cough* Illumi *cough*). However they are so brilliantly written, that they will be stuck in your memory for a good while. The character development is also incredible. Every lesson given to the main heroes stays with them and makes them stronger. No one just becomes an undefeatable god, everyone has to train their ass out to become good, or have some special talent, and even then they all have hidden weaknesses that can be exploited. You will find yourself uncertain about the outcome of each duel, because here it's not who is stronger, it's all about who is faster to find opponents weak spots without giving theirs away. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyement: 10\\n\r\nConsidering how good this anime is, this could be nothing else but a 10. I didn't regret a single moment spent with Gon and his friends. It always kept me going, wanting more and more, but at the finish line i was satisfied. I felt happy when i saw the finale, because this anime was a hell of a journey, that won't be forgotten any time soon.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nI know that the lenght of the show might scare you, but I really can't reccomend it enough. It will eat your time away like almost nothing else. \\n\r\nThe struggles, the battles, the emotions and the unforgettable characters will most likely leave you thinking about them 24/7 during your watch breaks. Of course this is purely my opinion, and you should always develop your own, but I genuinely believe that this may be as close to a masterpiece as a show can get, considering the length/quality. Truly a 10/10. Would watch again.",

            "content": "Honestly, I have never enjoyed an anime as much as I have enjoyed Hunter x Hunter. Nor have I binged on an anime to the point that I could finish it in a mere weekend. Hunter x Hunter had played a huge role in my childhood, and I rewatched it again. Even knowing what would happen, the strong impact it had on me from I was a child is still the same.\r\nThe story behind Hunter x Hunter is amazing. There are many arcs which shows the blossoming of the different friendships that acquires. The main goal of the main protagonist Gon was to find hisdad Ging, but he ended up having to go through several obstacles in order to reach that goal. That itself was the message behind the story. It was what Ging was trying to inform his son. \"You should enjoy the little detours to the fullest because you'll find the things more important than you want\" -Ging Freecss. Gon's main goal was to find his dad, but he ended up making a lot of new friends before he could do that. Those were the detours in his life, and they were absolutely worth it. I've never seen Gon so happy.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is flawless. Every detail is drawn so nicely, and the characters have good style. The voice actors did a good job in portraying their emotions. I remember the times in which some characters were so upset to the point that they were crying, and it wasn't the art that convinced me that they were upset. It was the ability of the voice actors to act that out. They really fit their roles very well, and the characters are absolutely adorable. Each and every one of them have their own unique personality, spicing up the stories. \\n\\n\r\nHunter x Hunter is definitely something I would recommend. It's worth it. I have no complains, to be honest.",

            "content": "Hunter x Hunter is the best shounen to date''.\r\nPeople commonly praise Hunter x Hunter as the best shounen ever created. I can't really say much about this because i've not watched many of the big shounen's. However, I can say that Hunter x Hunter is a solid shounen with a lot of good stuff to offer. It does remarkably well on it's characters and managed to create an interesting and engaging story, but not without flaws.\r\nWhen I think of Hunter x Hunter the first thing that comes to mind is how masterfully it develops it's side characters. While the main characters get significant amounts ofcharacter development the show truly shines at creating side characters and making you feel sympathetic with them, villainous or not. While not every single character is being used throughout the entire show, when they are relevant the show makes sure to tell us everything there is about them and makes sure not to leave them in the dust or use them for plot convenience... except for a few.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the things Hunter x Hunter suffers from is using characters for plot convenience. Multiple times throughout the show are we introduced to characters who are solely there to make our protagonists, named Gon and Killua, stronger. There is extensive amounts of training done by our protagonists during the show, which is a good thing. It shows us that power is reached by continuous training and not through the ''power of friendship''. The problem however, stems from the fact that we are introduced to characters who only exist to tell Gon and Killua how to get stronger. We barely get to know anything about their motives except for ''I can't bear seeing people with so much untapped potential so I will train you''. I would be fine with this if these characters were actually relevant to the plot outside of making our protagonists stronger but it feels more like an excuse to have these characters train Gon and Killua. After they're done training them we barely ever see these characters again.\\n\\n\r\nAnother instance of using characters for plot convenience has to do with foreshadowing. There is no power of friendship. There are however multiple instances of so called ''asspulls'' within the show. Characters who are gravely injured and bordering death who survive because the show randomly introduces plot points without any foreshadowing towards it's supposed existance. We are told at the last second about a special power a character has that makes said person survive. We have no clue's or indication towards these powers which means they were only brought up because the show needed a ''logical'' reason for our characters to survive. In another instance are we introduced to a character from a certain family that even had an arc about themselves who has the power to grant other people's wishes, but under certain conditions! Naturally this is right after one of our major characters is severely wounded. We've had no evidence of this character's existance untill she was necessary. Sure, she wasn't relevant to the plot before but when we were told who the members of the family were they should've mentioned her or anything regarding her existance. Instead she was pulled out of thin air when the show needed her the most. Talk about convenient.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking about being severely wounded. The show is really good at making sure to remind us our protagonists are, in fact, not invincible. Multiple times will we see them lose fights against the same opponent over and over and be severely outclassed. As I mentioned earlier there is no such thing as power of friendship within Hunter x Hunter and every victory by our protagonists is gained either by strategy or just being better. Yes, that's all there is to it. The people who have the most strength, within all it's forms win and that is certainly true for Hunter x Hunter. I should mention that actual fights are scarce except for a couple of arcs/episodes. Hunter x Hunter spends a lot of time on it's characters and the fights we get are varying in quality. I wouldn't say any of them are bad ( except for a certain arc when our characters just learned about new powers and steamroll through every opponent unaware about these powers ) but with the exception of a few they aren't anything to write home about either. \\n\\n\r\nThroughout the show we are introduced to several villainous groups and the way the show develops them to make you accept them morally is incredibly well done. Multiple times have I felt true regret and sympathy towards the villains. This is especially evident in one of the later arcs where the protagonists basically fight for human survival. The show makes us spend a lot of time with the villains and show us what they're like, what they're thinking, what they struggle with and why they do what they do. It shows us that villains can change aswell and as a result we get incredibly good development for most of them. Never before have I truly sympathized with the supposed villains in any show, but the way Hunter x Hunter makes us learn about the villains is truly worthy of praise.\\n\\n\r\nFrom a technical standpoint the show certainly doesn't fail to deliver.\\n\r\nThe art style used works fine for Hunter x Hunter. Backgrounds aren't always exactly the most detailed  but at times when the show focusses on world building the show tries hard and succeeds in showing us what we need to know. The show is certainly capable of good backgrounds and we are shown that plenty of times. Character designs fit the art really well. The backgrounds and character designs show enough similarities that the show looks very natural. Animation is above average throughout the entire show. I haven't witnessed any severe drops in quality and everything was overall very pleasing to look at.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtracks were really good and well done. I added a couple of them to my playlist because they're just that good. The show has fitting soundtracks for most of the situations, however I must say sometimes tracks were used at the wrong times. It didn't take away from the immersion but there were moments I thought to myself ''they should've used this track instead''. \\n\r\nThink about a lighthearted track during a serious moment or the other way round ( this is slightly exaggerated to get the point across ). \\n\r\nI don't pay much attention to sound effects but I will notice when a sound effect is really out of place. Gladly I didn't find anything out of the ordinary.\\n\\n\r\nHunter x Hunter is certainly an incredibly good show worth watching for anyone. It's commonly said to power through the first arc and I agree on this. While I consider the first arc to be fine and actually a load of fun it is a little generic. Consider it the introduction of the characters and plot. The true Hunter x Hunter starts after this. I promise you will not be disappointed.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Starting off as a manga released by Yoshihiro Togashi in 1998, Hunter x Hunter got an anime adaptation in 1999, but it was cut short in the middle of an arc due to Togashi's many hiatuses (UGH). It was followed up with three OVAs to cover the rest of the arc that wasn't animated, as well as the arc afterwards. \r\nBut in 2011, Madhouse decided to remake the series, following the example set by FMA: Brotherhood. And Madhouse definitely delivered.\r\nStory: There are 7 arcs in total, with the longest arc being about 60 episodes, and the shortest being about 10. The arcs link up almostseamlessly, with a clear beginning and ending of each arc.\\n\\n\r\nThe filler is almost nonexistent, with only 2 recap episodes early on. It's easy to see why; the source material was over a decade old by the time Madhouse got to it. But it's good to know that you're missing almost nothing by not reading the manga.\\n\\n\r\nYes, the show does have a bit of a slow start, and the later episodes can be almost DBZ levels of slow. But power through these flaws, and you won't regret it.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Long running shounen anime have a bad rep of not having the best quality animation, and you can understand why. You're bound to let a few errors through when you have to animate more than 100 episodes on a weekly schedule.\\n\\n\r\nBut HxH does not fall into this trap. The art and animation quality never slip, and at several points I was amazed at the quality of animation, especially during the fight scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Yes, the same opening song is used for all 148 episodes of the series (as two versions of the same song being alternated by arc), but it's such a good song that I never skipped past it during my watching of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe endings do change, though, and they are worth sitting through. I'm the type of guy that goes to the next episode as soon as the ending credits hit, no matter the show. But HxH was an exception. I still listen to the ending songs regularly, even after I've finished watching the series.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the music in the actual episode, it's not as memorable as the opening and ending, but it does a good job of getting you hyped for what's gonna happen next.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the voice acting is FANTASTIC. If I had to imagine what each character would sound like if I had not heard their voice, I would imagine it would sound like these voices.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: All the characters are memorable. Whether it be the main characters or some person that showed up for a few episodes and was never mentioned again (such as Zepile), everyone gets plenty of development, which makes what happens in the later arcs matter that much more to you.\\n\\n\r\nGon starts out as the traditional physically gifted, but mentally not as gifted, shounen protagonist. As the series progresses, he makes some strides in his abilities, to the point where he can do some genuinely genius stuff during his fights with the villains.\\n\\n\r\nKillua starts out as a cold assassin, but Gon and the gang warms him up, and later on he supplies some of the best comedic moments of the series, even when the series is at its darkest point. But even though he gains a comedic side, he doesn't sacrifice any of his fighting capabilities.\\n\\n\r\nKurapika has one goal and one goal only; to kill the thieves that murdered his clan. Kurapika gets his own arc to accomplish his goal, and its one of the best arcs in the entire series. Sadly, Kurapika mostly disappears after the arc is over.\\n\\n\r\nLeorio is clearly the weak link of the group, being easily fooled into traps and being the weakest in terms of both physical strength and Nen capabilities. But he eventually becomes something of a father figure to Gon and Killua before disappearing, never to be seen again.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: After finishing the series, I began consuming everything HxH, but in the back of my mind, I realize nothing will equal this series unless they do a second remake that's somehow better than this.\\n\\n\r\nYou will laugh, you will cry (oh you WILL cry), and once you're done, you will want to watch it again as soon as the last episode ends.\\n\\n\r\nFinal thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nYes, it falls victim to some typical shounen tropes. Yes, it can get on the slow side, especially near the end. Yes, it ends on a psuedo-cliffhanger that will probably not be resolved in the manga until the year 3000. But the positives of the series are so good that you almost totally forget about the negatives.",

With the epic soundtrack combined ,it is just one enjoyable anime. I hope it continues one day. If you didn'twatch it ,JUST DO IT. JUST DO IT !!",

            "content": "The only part I didn't like about the story was how they babied fans by explaining every detail piece by piece in the Chimera Ant arc, they took too long showing a battle that lasted half an hour over several episodes. That just killed my thirst for action. But that was my only main complaint. Overall it was great to watch and rewatch again.\r\nThe art style of the anime stays true to what the manga appears to be, the animators didn't get lazy by reusing certain frames because of the dialogue, I didn't see any frame repeats except for maybe Gon's iconic move.\r\nThe sound/music wasokay, they got really lazy with openings and kept it to one song with all it's seasons which was a disappointment, I love the endings a lot more. The music in the series seems iconic now because it's well timed in certain events of the story and the sound effects are well done and timed.\\n\\n\r\nThe push for the story at the beginning seems natural to me, it didn't seem pushed and forced uncomfortably, but as the series progressed the push kinda seems to wear off and I would seem more interested on the expansion into the current plot at hand. Though it still does drag my interest.\\n\\n\r\nThe character design is diverse, but! Gon seems like Naruto, being not the sharpest tool in the shed, exceptional stamina and never giving up on friends. Kurapika seeks to be an avenger, kinda sounds like Sasuke. Anyways what I'm trying to point out is, these Shonen Jump series seem too similar in character design and character design isn't what we look forward to in these series. The character powers, side characters and diversity of them makes up for the somewhat cookie cutter main characters.\\n\\n\r\nAll I wished is the author of the series to continue the anime like he did with the manga, but it seems to have ended with 148.",

            "content": "An anime with a lot of potential but destroyed by greed. The animation is solid trough the entire series with the music being good but repetitive. Character design is good as well with no unnecessarily sexualized characters and fan service. First 75 episodes are well paced and with no fillers except the recap episodes. But after that point the lack of source material was obvious with the prolonging every point with repetition and heavy narration even for the most obvious things in the story and having narrator describe everything in heavy detail. This makes it painfully hard to watch so I would recommend for everyoneto find on the internet a list of episodes you can skip if you want to watch it. This series would probably have an 8/10 grade without that, but since it lasts for so long I can't ignore it and it really ruins the whole experience. I would recommend waiting for the next iteration of the anime.",

That's what I love about this anime it had me so engrossed from the very first arc! On the other hand, I could hardly find any faults in Hunter x Hunter, leading to such aperfect rating (excluding the music) \\n\r\nThankyou for reading my review!",

            "content": "The first word that comes to mind when I think about Hunter x Hunter is undoubtedly: VARIETY. With everything from insane, heart-raising action to comedy so ridiculous that I laugh alone in my room on numerous occasions; Hunter x Hunter is an anime that quickly shot to my number 1 favorite and only secures it's place more determinedly with every episode.\r\nAt this point, although still ongoing, I'm roughly halfway through HxH and I've loved every single minute of it. That's because in this show, every minute matters. You can't look away without missing something crucial, hilarious or just generally entertaining. I was a late comerto the HxH bandwagon and after around 10 episodes, I was sorely angered with myself for leaving it this late. All I can say now is thank heavens I finally gave this anime a shot. NEWCOMERS. DO NOT BE PUT OFF BY THE LENGTH. WHEN YOU START WATCHING; IT DOESN'T EVEN MATTER ANYMORE. Where I first found myself concerned as to whether I'd have the time or motivation to catch up with this anime, I now find myself worried about catching up and having to wait a week for each episode! And man, do those episodes fly by. The best anime are the ones that make it impossible to say 'okay, that's enough for now'. \\n\\n\r\nThe array of interesting and unique characters is what really makes this series. HxH is not afraid to go with the cliche, make fun of the cliche, experiment with the dark and creepy, the light and fluffy, and everything in between. With 2 adorable yet terrifyingly powerful protagonists and their ever-changing company, you're guaranteed to come across multiple characters that you love, hate or just plain can't get your head around. But even without the constantly growing cast, Gon and Killua really do make this a special anime. Watching the two grow (albeit quite quickly with the pace of the anime) and experiencing all the WONDERS OF FRIENDSHIP AND SELF DISCOVERY is easily the main reason for my love of this anime. Not forgetting, of course, creepy-ass perv Hisoka on the side is just the cherry on the cake.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime is just plain fun. It's addictive, interesting, varied and entertaining in every sense of the word. It really is an anime that has something for everyone. WATCH IT.",

            "content": "I have not read the manga, mostly because I don't want to wait for every chapter for 6 months, nor watched the 1999 anime, but I can say that this specific piece of entertainment is fucking amazing.\r\nStory (9):\r\nI would say that the story is 10/10 if it wasn't for the beginning. The first 4 episodes are absolute trash. The rest of the hunter exam arc (till ep. 21)  and the Zoldyck family arc (ep.22-ep.26) are really good. The heaven's arena (ep.27-ep.36) arc is great and it has the introduction to nen aka one of the best battle systems in all of shounen, up therewith stands from JoJo's, but shit gets real in the Yorknew city arc (ep. 37-ep.58) which is my favourite arc in the series, but barely because of the fan-favourite arc (which I'm gonna mention later on). Gon and Killua fuck of somewhere for the first half of the arc and Kurapika gets the role of the \"main character\". The Phantom Troupe is from this arc too and it's one of the best villain groups ever. Then the Greed island arc (ep.59.-ep.75) which is amazing as well, but not as good as the arc before it or the arc after it. And the Chimera ant arc (ep.76-ep.136.). What can I say, it's fucking glorious. It's probably the darkest arc in the series. Nuff said. And then Chairman election arc (ep.137-ep.148). It's not that much talked about, but I think it was pretty great. So that's basically all the arcs in Hunter x Hunter. Yeah. On we go...\\n\\n\r\nArt (9):\\n\r\nThe art is pretty good, but what surprised me the most was the consistent quality of the animation. Madhouse really did a good job. A lot of the times in long running shounens the budget is wasted in the first dozen episodes, but here it's really consistently used throughout the whole anime. And... there's not much more to say about it. It's not spectacular, but it is great.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8):\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is really good, but there aren't that much individual tracks that I could list. I loved the opening, but it was used all throughout the anime with different animation. And after hearing it 148 times, it kind of loses its magic. But that's it for the music.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (10):\\n\r\nThe only complaint I have character wise is Gon, the protagonist. He's really bland, but everyone else is great (although I did unleast enjoy him in the Chimera ant arc). Killua is great, Kurapika is great as well, even Leorio is good. But the characters that stand out the most to me are the villains, especially the Phantom Troupe, the royal guards and the king. Every character from the Phantom Troupe seems real. What I mean with that is that the seem like they had lives before entering our main characters' story. And the royal guards and the king all have their interesting philosophies that make them human (even though they're technically not). The chairman and all the candidates for that position from the last arc are all great as well. I would kill myself if I didn't mention Hisoka, because I get wet just thinking about him (no, that's a lie). I covered a lot of them so let's move on.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10):\\n\r\nExcept for those first 4 episodes, the whole show is a hell of a ride. And one day, I would like to see the manga finish and the rest of it get adapted, but that's far in the future.\\n\\n\r\nOverall=10/10\\n\r\nAnd Pitou best character, best ant and, of course, best girl (please tell me she's a girl)...\\n",

            "content": "\"There's something more important than the world right now\", and that something is friendship which is probably the major theme in this series. \r\nStory: The story is about a boy who's 12 years old in the beginning named Gon, in the broadest view the show is about Gon's goal which is to find his dad, and in this journey to find his dad he comes across other situations which he must overcome in order to full fill his main goal, it's basically little goals setup to the main goal which explains why this show has multiple arcs on the different situations which he must overcome. \\n\\n\r\nThe story however doesn't just resolve around gon only, Gon throughout the show meets up with 3 other major characters, one of them being Killua who becomes Gon's best friend. Within each arc we see these major characters trying to reach their goal. One thing i love about the show is how it doesn't always make the good guys look good, in many anime's we see the show try to make the villain or antagonist seem extremely bad so we don't feel bad for them if they die. In this show it's different and the reason we should all love this anime, instead of making the antagonist look bad they show their opinions and their view in the world. This way we better understand them and feel different towards them. \\n\\n\r\nThe story mainly consist of a tournament which is always fun to watch, adventure, background stories, competition involving many fight scenes, and protection of the wealthy such as prestige characters which we see Kurapika doing who one of the 3 major character gon meets.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: With Gon and Killua it's pretty basic and probably something we've seen before, Gon and Killua are both prodigies which means that although they're young, they have extreme potential. Some example where we see prodigies are Full metal alchemist,  Shokugeki no Souma, and even naruto having Sasuke being full of potential and promise. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough Gon and Killua follow this trait they are still extremely unique and special such as their background story and the way they deal with situations. An example could be with Killua's train of thought in combat situations.  \\n\\n\r\nAll the characters in the show are unique and has a great variety, i personally can't find any character good or bad that i hate, i may dislike one character cause they're in the way but you can't hate any of them. Even the villains have so much characterisation you come to like the character such as Hisoka. Most if not all the characters we've seen comes back into the story and plays apart in it, we don't see a character in one arc and disappear for the rest of the series. instead they reappear which emphasises HxH efforts in characterisation.\\n\\n\r\nIMPORTANT NOTES:\\n\r\n-throughout the show you might disagree or dissatisfied with how an event took it's turn, an important note to take is to trust the producers and the story writer because in the end, you will be satisfied with it. Basically you need to trust the producer and story teller because they will find a way to make you comfortable with the ending of a scenario.\\n\r\n-if you don't like the anime keep watching it until you reach about episode 10, the first couple episodes are sorta misleading because it's mostly the setup of the main show such as introducing 2 of the 3 major characters in the anime.\\n\r\n-If you are discouraged by the cover and don't wanna watch it because it's about younger protagonists then you need to keep in mind that HxH age recommendation is 17+, this show was not made for younger viewers.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION: This anime is probably the best i've seen, the main story of finding Gon's dad isn't really exciting but it's the journey that makes the show 10/10 with all the teaching Gon and Killua learned. One reason i binged watched this show is the characters because i wanted to see more of them because of how unique each and everyone of them are. Almost every episode leaves with a tiny cliffhanger just enough to convince you to watch one more episode. If you love anime with tournament and competition along with concentrated fight scenes this is for you. If you enjoy any of the following: Naruto, Full metal alchemist, or even fairy tale this show is for you.\\n\\n\r\nThings you can take from this anime:\\n\r\n-Everybody deserves a friend.\\n\r\n-Only takes one friend to change your entire life.\\n\r\n-Be nice to others because they'll return the favour.\\n\r\n-Give and don't expect to get.\\n\r\n-Respect your opponent such as sports.\\n\r\n-Defend your beliefs.\\n\r\n-Never abandon a friend.\\n\r\n-Trust your friend.\\n\r\n-You don't have to have similarities to be friends.\\n\r\n-Never judge a person's personalty by it's cover, its about experience with that person.\\n\r\n-And appreciate the people who are with you now and what they have done to get you where you're at.",

            "content": "You open the MAL page for HxH and read tge synopsis. You are like, might be good. Then you glance at the number of episodes and are like: 148......that is a lot of episodes for this synopsis. That was exactly me before starting the series. I am really greatful to my friends who forced me to watch this one as this has turned out to be the best SHONEN anime I have watched.\r\nEven though the anime lasts 148 eps, it is jampacked with content. The story moves at a good pace and transition between arcs is flawless. It will take just 3-4 eps to gethooked to this anime. Do you like action? Or shonen? Or supernatural? This anime has it all. This review DOES NOT contain spoilers\\n\\n\r\nSTORY:\\n\r\nMarvellous!! The anime throws suprises one after another. After like 40 eps, it is watching a different anime with same characters and the fact that it was pulled off so well amazes me. The story can be categorized into various arcs.\\n\\n\r\nHUNTER EXAM        (10/10)  20 eps\\n\r\nZOLDYCK FAMILY    (9/10)    6 eps\\n\r\nHEAVENS ARENA    (8/10)   12 eps\\n\r\nYORKNEW CITY       (8/10)    20 eps\\n\r\nGREED ISLAND        (10/10) 17 eps.......MY FAVOURITE ARC\\n\r\nCHIMERA ANT         (9/10)    61 eps\\n\r\nCHAIRMAN               (7/10)   12 eps\\n\\n\r\nART AND SOUND:\\n\r\nThe moment I knew Madhouse studios did this, I knew that the art is and animation is going to be fabulous. Well detailed stills and fluid motion that is seen in most anime was also seen in this one. The Opening was  great, so were the OST's. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:\\n\r\nThis anime had like 40-50 characters that had a considerable impact on the anime. The good thing was that each episode got enough character development and everybody's actions and decisions made sense.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nThere were 3 recap episodes in the whole series which was logical as the anime aired for 3 years. There were some special moments of brilliance in the entire series. There were times you could not imagine what was coming next. THIS ANIME IS A MUST WATCH FOR ANY ANIME FAN.",

            "content": "This is my favourtie anime of all time, and since watching it I have yet to find another anime able to create a range of characters as interesting as those in Hunter x Hunter.\r\nSTORY - 9 \r\nI was constantly interested in the story and what was to come next throughout every arc of this anime. Even in the weaker arcs, I was compelled by the overarching goals of each characters as well as the constant build ups to important events. Despite some pacing issues in latter arcs, I never felt burnt out watching this even though I was watching it pretty much non stop wheneverI could. Simple story overall, but with many complex and intricate subplots which were fantastically written. The main reason why this section wasn't a 10/10 was because of the fact that it is incomplete in some areas due to the manga being unfinished, leaving me wanting more.\\n\\n\r\nART - 8\\n\r\nCan't complain about the art and animation in this series. There were no instances where I thought the art was uninspired or boring and when necessary, the animation was very impressive. The character designs are iconic and memorable, and the settings are all great.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND - 9\\n\r\nGreat OST with numerous brilliant tracks which help create brilliant atmosphere and ambience when needed. The OST helps significantly with the frequent shifts in tone which occur in this anime, and in my opinion they always worked perfectly with the mood on screen. A great OP which was very hard to not sing along to and some good EDs as well. Some of the character themes were great, I particulalry loved Hisoka's theme.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER - 10\\n\r\nI think the characters were the best part of this anime, with a great main cast and (arguably) even better supporting characters. I liked Gon; he was a simple character but was certainly not one-dimensional and perfect as some protagonists are. Killua was brilliantly written and his friendship with Gon is iconic and the series couldn't be nearly as good without him. The antagonists in this show were my favourite characters, and I'm yet to have found other shows with a similarly broad cast of great antagonists. Hisoka is, in my opinion, one of the best supporting characters in any anime - whenever he was on screen the show improved drastically and I would love to see more from him. Without any spoilers, the other groups of villains all exceeded my expectations, and include some of the best morally grey characters I've seen in television.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT - 9\\n\r\nPretty obvious based off everything I said that I loved this anime, the only reason this isn't a 10 is because of the minor pacing issues in some longer arcs which left me impatient for the story to develop, however this was difficult to avoid due to the nature of the situations in which these issues occurred, and this was not a huge problem for me.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL - 10\\n\r\nBasically, if you haven't watched this anime, watch it. In my opinion it gets better and better as it goes on, with some exceptions with early arcs that are outstanding. A fantastic show with a lot of emotion and enjoyment.",

            "content": "*MINOR Spoiler in \"Enjoyment\"*\r\nWhere do I even begin? Hunter X Hunter is by far one of the best animes I've seen to date. Everything from the plot to the characters was great. I don't think I was ever bored, except for those random fillers that recapped everything, which I gladly skipped. \r\nStory: 10/10\r\nThe reason this anime has received such praise is because the story is not only good, but it's told in the best way possible. From beginning to end, I was genuinely excited and craved more. The logic used in this anime is simply superb, and the bits of comedy is a nice breakfrom the drama that occurs. There aren't many fillers, which I appreciated. Instead of wasting an entire episode, they add comic relief sometimes, and it's never overdone. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nThe animation is excellent, as is the art style. Nothing much more to say here.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThe sound is also great. Expect a great opening and endings, as well as good battle music.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nObviously, I enjoyed this anime a lot. The characters are all noteworthy, and their development is amazing. Many animes make the mistake of not providing enough room for development. Hunter X Hunter does not do that at all. It even has you feeling for the secondary characters (still crying about meruem & komugi tbh). \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n",

            "content": "And the trip goes on .. was the feeling that i had when I finished this series. An impressive journey actually, through the unknown world of Hunter x Hunter with a big revelation in the end that just makes us want another season of it. \r\n148 episodes of ? Fun, epicness, some drama and also some gay moments (like really weird moments) \r\nHunter x Hunter is a story that follows a young 12 years old kid named Gon who is looking for his father and for finding him he has to become a \"Hunter\" and start a journey around the world looking for him. Boring?Crappy plot? Well is everything except that. \\n\\n\r\nWhen i heard that Hunter x Hunter looks like One Piece (the general setup is really similar, both start a journey to reach their dreams) i got scared, i was thinking that it was another over rated anime with nothing new to show .. how wrong i was .. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10. In one hand, the story is really engaging.. in the other hand, the execution of the inicial setup of each arc really makes us wonder how good it actually is.. I mean that each arc ends in a strange way. \"That's it?\" Was the question that I always had in the end of each arc. There are 6 arcs.  \\n\\n\r\nAnother tiny problem, is how this anime looks like other animes that i've seen. The setup looks like One Piece, and the special powers and everything related looks like Naruto. The thing is, both are better than Hunter x Hunter on doing it. But while both Naruto and One Piece are just too big and get boring, here such thing doesn\u00b4t happen. \\n\\n\r\nThe pace of Hunter x Hunter is what really suprised me. For a shonen, it kinda moves really fast. The fights don\u00b4t take more than a couple of minutes (excluding the last arc, where the entire fight takes several episodes). There are no flashbacks, no fillers, there is no development on the evil guys what so ever, so the anime moves much faster than most of the shonens out there. \\n\\n\r\nThe last thing i have to say, this anime has a lot of tiny plot fails that i just can\u00b4t forget. In some way, it seemed that the author forgot some parts of it's own story.. but well those are rare and meaningless. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10. Well .. i wish it was better. The detail on the background for the most part is weak or non-existant. Only few landscapes are awesome. The rest is pretty baddy. The character desigh is not outstanding as well. So why the 8/10? \\n\\n\r\nIT HAS ONE OF THE BEST FACIAL EXRPESSIONS I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE. \\n\\n\r\nWe can actually imagine the situation by looking at their faces. Really impressive. The best point is when they are presenting feelings like rage or fear, it just looks awesome. \\n\\n\r\nAnd then ... there is one face that i will never forget. Towards the end .. just .. WOW. I can even say the entire episode sucked compared with that last moment (and the episode is actually one of the best episodes here). \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10. There is one problem. The soundtrack is always the same. For 148 episodes .. it gets boring hearing that. The only part when they change a bit the tracks used, is ont he 5th arc (the best one) but still way too repetitive. \\n\\n\r\nWhat really makes up for it, is the opening(which is always the same as well) but it is just way too good for it's purpose. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10. Well, this is odd. In terms of developemt, there is not much of it. But .. they characters are really likeable. we have a huge cast so we have a huge variety of characters. Feel free to pick one because i'm sure you will find one that you will like. \\n\\n\r\nAbout our main characters, Gon, Killua, Kurapika, Leorio. While Gon and Killua have their place in every single arc, Kurapika and Leorio seemed like they were there for nothing. \\n\\n\r\nThere are some arcs where they don\u00b4t even appear. I can say, Gon is the main character, Killua the second main chracter(less important than Gon) and Kurapika and Leorio act like secondary characters. I didn\u00b4t liked that. I wanted more of them, especially from Kurapika. He has a entire arc for himelf, but still is not enough. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10. Well.. for a long time i didn\u00b4t saw 10 episode each day for a weak .. the anime starts slowly, but once it gets good, is good until the end. The arc that i disliked more and probably is the worst one, is the 4th arc.. \\n\\n\r\nThere are some memorable moments, I laugh, I almost cried.. this anime as it. A combination of pure action, some drama (only in the 5th arc but it was good as hell), epicness.. there is everything here. \\n\\n\r\nAnother great point, is the relation between Killua and Gon. Being a shonen often means themes like friendship. Here we can actually see a slow evolution of their relation as friends and really pays off in the end. I felt that i learned something about friendship with this anime .. which is rare because most of the anime out there, when they talk about friendship, is always clich\u00ea stuff.. \\n\\n\r\nFor last, the feeling of adventure is present in every arc and it really felt good. I personally loved it. \"Fight for your dreams, and you will see that in the process you will find what really matters\" was the sentence that i liked more.. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10. I reccomend it. It has my seal of approval. Don\u00b4t get scared with the 148 episodes,.. because they are 148 episodes of pure fun. \\n",

            "content": "I don't even know where to begin with this review. I don't think I have enough words to describe or express how much I enjoyed this series, or as to why it is so underlooked by the anime community as a whole. Bearing in mind that I have not seen the original 1999 series, nor do I even want to after this rework as it is utterly amazing. I am also going to start this review with my conclusion...Togashi, please finish Dragon Quest and get back to drawing up weekly Hunter x Hunter again. Please for the love of all that's holy!\r\nStory (10/10):\r\nConsidering it's startingpoint as an underdog story whereby everything goes the main character's way somehow, Hunter x Hunter does its best in showing you why you are completely wrong with that view point. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime takes a sudden turn once all the character and ability backgrounds have been covered. It becomes a very dark and psychological story, surprising viewers with a fair bit of gore and violence. Put it this way, Hunter x Hunter is a shounen alongside that of One Piece, Naruto etc. which are very tame when it comes violence. The former however, adds a fair amount of gore so be prepared to see some limb loss, highly detailed broken bones as well as other things you would not see from a general shounen series. \\n\\n\r\nFor anyone who reads the HxH manga, the anime does it complete justice in bringing it into animated form. There is barely any filler (much like FMA Brotherhood). As well as this, the entire ability/power basis in HxH is probably the best explained out of any combat anime, whereby tactics are explained fully, leaving no room for viewers to question how anything actually happened, especially regarding character's ability levels. I was even more impressed at how this was put across in animated form. \\n\\n\r\nArt (10/10):\\n\r\nThe art style used in HxH suits the anime perfectly. Although you will question why some character aura's are the colour they are, but this is mainly due to colour connotation effects, not any actual problem revolving around the art used. I absolutely love the art style and have nothing more to say on this matter. \\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10):\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for HxH compliments every scene perfectly, particularly during fight scenes where the music will have you on the edge of your seat, or covered in goosebumps at how awesome it is. I love the opening theme as well. Although coming back to my earlier point of HxH surprising you with how dark it suddenly turns within the story, the opening is a prime example of this. The opening theme is happy and feel-good. It does not give you a full outlook on how dark the story turns suddenly. Ending themes are also fun to listen to, particularly during the first arc. The band who wrote that ending song for the first arc have quickly become one of my favourite Japanese artists. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (10/10):\\n\r\nSome of the most interesting characters I've ever come across in anime. I won't say much because many spoilerinos. But you will love almost all of the characters in some. Personally I enjoy villains, so to see a large number of them in this anime was piqued my interest of this series even more. If you can do a villain to such a good standard that you like them more than the main characters, you're doing a banging job like. Togashi does just this in the manga and the anime portrays them perfectly. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10):\\n\r\nI don't even think I have to say how much I enjoyed this series. One of the, if not the best anime series out there. It rivals FMA Brotherhood for best anime ever for me. This series will never get old. I consider it that good that I wished I never watched it in the first place because I want to watch it afresh again, without knowing any details. Such an unreal piece of work by both mangaka and anime studio. The only thing I can say that was probably the least enjoyable part of the series is that it had to end again, due to the mangaka not publishing any further chapters. For HxH anime fans, I'd highly recommend reading the manga from the point the anime left it on. And for manga and anime fans of this series alike, pray to any God you believe in that a new chapter is out soon. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (10/10):\\n\r\nAbsolutely amazing series. For those who have started watching anime, or those who have been watching for years, I urge you to watch this series as soon as possible. It is highly underlooked by the anime community, for no good reason. Anyone who has not seen this series is missing out on one of the best anime around. Forget Naruto (which totally steals the chakra basis from HxH, js) and all the other mainstream series at the minute. Put this at the top of your watching lists and just enjoy anime at its best. For anyone who reads this, pray to the manga Gods that Togashi writes another chapter soon. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Please note this a review based on the first 50 episodes, so please keep that in mind.\r\nStory 8: The story of HunterxHunter is quite competently made, taking many of the shounen tropes we have all seen and heard a hundred times and polishing them to a sheer shine till they are nigh unrecognizable, allowing for a new sense of excitement and enjoyment that is lacking in many other action/battle anime. However, the true joy of the narrative structure is how grounded it all is. Many of the problems the characters face are handled in a realistic manner and are explored throughly in order to makeeven the most ridiculous situation feel more grounded. This in turn allows the narrative to feel more possible and more grounded, which only makes the moments of earth shattering power and dynamics that are present in the combat even more impactful. Whats surprising however is how this show keeps your attention even when in comparison to other shounen, it has remarkably few fights. An entire arch could pass, spanning 10-12 episodes, with maybe 3 or 4 fights among them and each fight only taking up to 1 or 2 episodes. Yet it still is able to fully hold your attention and keep you on the edge of your seat because of how well structured its narrative and world are.  Now, while the story is absolutely solid, it isnt a masterclass, suffering from some minor hiccups that are hard to ignore. The most prominent being that, at times, it suffers from the 'reactive protagonist' problem, where the cast only moves forward, progressing the plot, because some outside force has compelled them into doing so, thus reducing the agency of the character in question. This however, only occurs twice in the 50 episodes ive seen, and the show more than makes up for it with its in depth characterization scenes and its unique approach to world building. \\n\\n\r\nArt 8: On first glance Hunter x Hunter does not look remarkable, maybe even mediocre in its art. This however is a trap meant to lower your expectations because holy shit when the animation is solid IT IS SOLID! With fights that are both well choreographed and blindingly fast this series gives an excellent cross between the \"light speed exchange\" of DBZ, and the \"strategic counter play\" featured in the classic Naruto. In all honesty, the speed and flow of the combat is unlike anything I have seen in shounen. The art in these moments is truly spectacular, accentuating every little detail to make it as visually impressive, fast, and, most importantly, coherent as possible. It also has a great use of lighting, punctuating each scene with a mood that permeates every second. Its only fault i'd say is that some of the sets early on (like up to episode 10ish) can look slightly off at times, feeling a bit like a painting in the background, while still rare it should be taken into account. Also, the speech animation is pretty standard, which doesnt really detract from the show as a whole (with like 1 or 2 exceptions), but still should be recognized. \\n\\n\r\nSound 9: I was surprised by how much I loved the sound design in this series, but god damn do I, its fucking excellent. From the fast and well paced op that, while not brain bustingly amazing, is competently put together to fit in with the video played with it, to the surprisingly diverse and unique scores that are scattered across the series, this series is exceedingly well done in its audio quality. Whats more shocking isnt that its audio and music is so good its that the creator uses it so sparingly. Where most anime bombard the viewer with specific noises associated with a certain mood in every single episode in order to condition the viewer to have a certain response (think of bleach's jazz lady music), Hunter X Hunter differs because it uses these kinds of music quite rarely. Instead using them only to punctuate a truly intense or impactful moment, using them either to express a moment of rising terror or to give a pay off to a climactic moment. Unlike most actions series most of the time tension is built through complete, or near complete, silence. Many episodes feature almost no music at all, relying instead on ambient noise to set the mood and build tension. Some episodes go one step further and just mute the sound all together in a scene, causing you to feel a sudden intensity that just makes what would have been a good scene and turns it into excellence. One episode even goes for almost 10 min with only the most minimal of audio, featuring long moments of complete silence, and let me tell you, that is easily one of the most intense things I have ever seen or heard in all of shounen. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9: The characterization in Hunter x Hunter is again quite solid. However, it develops the cast in a way that is pretty unique compared to other shounen. Unlike most shounen stories, or action stories in general, the characters are independent of modern ideas of morality, and hold themselves to a standard all their own. Sure they fight for friendship and yada yada, but extortion, bribery, theft, torture, murder, rendering someone possibly disfigured for the rest of their entire life are only a couple things that the characters in this show do, and the characters express awareness of magnitude of these actions. However, what makes this great is that each character has a different view on said action, and whether the action is ok or not, and the show in turn has a mature discussion on matters of morality through these conflicts. I could exposit on how the characters are well rounded or how the blonde guy is pretty much sasuke (and how making him a supporting character and not the main rival was a genius choice so that he doesnt grate the nerves) or how glasses doesnt get to do...well...much of anything, but thats not what I want to harp on about. I instead want to express my love for how this set of characters regardless of its flaws are really likable, relatable, and have a dynamic that just makes so much sense (which let me say, is a great breath of fresh air). For example, the two main characters come from vastly different backgrounds and in turn have different experience, so unlike say naruto, where the protag just does it his way and every one just kind of goes with it and tells him he's a moron later on, but really he's somehow still the greatest even though he doesnt really listen to anyone for half the series, this show recognizes the difference in experience and the cast acts accordingly. Kuja, the more combat and worldly experienced of the group, often directs the group and makes plans, giving advice on how to deal with a situation before they begin. Gon, who is more experienced with human interaction, and with nature often takes the lead when it comes to talking to others or when it comes trying to deal with issues concerning nature. Honestly, I could go on all day on this matter, but needless to say each character is well developed and meshes well with each other to make a great dynamic.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8: Hunter x Hunter is an excellent series that leaves you on the edge of your seat in even the dullest moments, and while it is still a pretty standard shounen action series, it is a damn good shounen action series that is far above the likes of the big 3. The characters, art and sound direction are all melded to make an experience that is both thoughtful, and intense in nature. It is a well developed piece of pop corn entertainment that has just enough depth to get you thinking, but not enough to force upon an existential self reflection.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8.5: When it comes down to it, this series is the pinacle of its genre, and will give you a constant sense of nostalgia, from Naruto and Bbleach, to DBZ, Yu Yu Hakushon and even Jo Jo's Bizzare Adventure, this story has something that is present in all shounen, and wether it was inspired by, or further inspired them, the series takes all the best elements  and makes a strong effort to utilize them to their fullest, and I can say that it succeeds without a doubt. This series is an excellent example of what a great shounen can be and should be noted as the benchmark in which we judge all other action anime. It really is just that good. So if you enjoy action/battle anime you owe it to yourself to watch Hunter x Hunter (2011).",

I\u2019m so glad I decided to watch it because this show has left me with unforgettable memories. And I\u2019m low-key sad it ended because it\u2019s gonna take me few days to get over it.\r\n I just love Gon and Killua\u2019s relationship from the bottom of my heart.\r\nKillua....I just have no words for him. \r\nAnd hisoka gave me some -_- moments but can\u2019t bring myself to hatehim lmaooo. He\u2019s quite interesting indeed. \\n\r\nAnd all the characters are awesome including the villains. The character developments are just too good. \\n\r\nThe show had so many moral dilemmas which had me seriously thinking until the end.\\n\r\nIt\u2019s not just about the heroes fighting the villains and emerging victorious. \\n\r\nHxH got me thinking if the heroes are really good and villains really bad. I\u2019ve questioned this before in Naruto and now I was questioning myself again. And maybe it\u2019s just me haha.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m aware about Mangaka\u2019s health issues and manga being on indefinite hiatus so I was really worried how I would wait after the anime was over. And I\u2019m sure many of you might have that question in mind too and maybe not starting the series for that very reason (that was one of my reason too for not watching it till now, a lame excuse right?) \\n\r\nBut worry not because right now I\u2019m just so satisfied with everything. Ofcourse not all my questions were answered and there were fights and maybe arcs I was waiting for to happen but that\u2019s okay. Atleast it didn\u2019t end at a cliffhanger or something so I couldn\u2019t have asked for more :)\\n\r\nAs for shortcomings....Yes there were and other reviews might have in-depth details for the same but I rate and review purely based on my experience and enjoyment rather than critically analysing each and everything so yeah 10/10 for everything.\\n",

Third time watching it (first time with brother, second with friend, now is third time with another friend). Every time, I notice new things that just make me love the show even more. How I can feel so much... emotion about a show, I don't know. But that's Hunter x Hunter. \r\nThere are surely other people that have gone super in-depth about everything good about HxH. So, I don't feel the need to do that (nor particularly want to). Just know that this show is great. Veryspecial in its own way. If you are one to think the first 37 or so episodes aren't great, just keep watching until the end of the fourth arc (PT (trying not to spoiler)). If by then, you still aren't impressed, it would probably be best to stop. However, if you feel like you enjoy the show, but not head-over-heels, just keep watching. It's great, the second last arc is super special. \\n\\n\r\nPretty much everything that consists a show is great in Hunter x Hunter (eg. characters, writing, style, story, etc.). I can only see very few people getting into hunter x hunter then willingly stop. The first 2 arcs aren't even that bad, just fleshing out characters and setting up a base. Lots of very unexpected shit happens, don't think that everything will be anything close to the first arc (oh my have I gotten quite a ride). \\n\\n\r\nOk, I think I have finished. Would recommend to anyone, jesus this is a great show.",

Why?\r\nBecause... The old story arcs that I find really intriguing, such as Hunter Exam, Heaven's Arena and Greed Island have been summarized and shortened and not given as much credit just so the anime can focus on the worst and most boring arc possible - Chimera Ant.\r\nIt's inferior, because it has all the previous story, but the new one, that makes it stand out is actually really bad. They should've just called this Hunter X Hunte: ChimeraAnt and have only this arc, not confuse people and have some ignore the superior 1999 version and watch the botched old arcs in HD as the only redeeming value.\\n\\n\r\nNot to mention that many characters and locations look different from how they look in the manga, which are more accurately depicted in the 1999 version. \\n\\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, I don't glorify the 1999 version, it's just that the 2011 version has absolutely no redeeming values. For me it's absolutely pointless.\\n\\n\r\nI would advise anyone who would want to get the most out of the Hunter X Hunter anime to watch first the 1999 version and when it finishes to watch the Chimera Arc in the 2011 version.",

Despite the fact that life is complete with the sun, the land, and poetry.\" -- The real Supreme Leader Diego\r\nWhat follows is my first review for an anime series. I've watched it the first time ~2 years ago, and re-watching it again.\r\nThe story is fantastic. The 'arcs' of hxh are nothing like One Piece or Bleach. The ebb and flow in each story's development is unpredictable, and will leave the viewers' puny attempts at guessing the coursein the dirt. Sometimes, such a juicy plot bomb is dropped, that you have to pause and marvel at how carefully the threads of various details led to a certain conclusion. The author doesn't care for going easy on you, so you will feel every bump on the heroes' journey as your own, and you will feel deeply for the characters. The fights are intelligent, emotionally intense, and often completely unpredictable. The breadth and depth of themes is arguably the most ambitious of any anime I've seen: the sacrifices of friendship, the meaning of struggle, the cost of love, the nature of humanity, and many, many more.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy, the training sub-arcs, the raw emotion: everything is well-thought out. The characters' emotional reactions are much more believable than in your standard shonen. The tropes (e.g., \"kill me please\", \"bad guys work alone\", etc.) are destroyed mercilessly in the process, and the world is better for it. God, so much better.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter design is amazing. Almost all characters have meaning. You really need to see for yourself the many ways in which they shine. The initial appearances are already enough for you to fall instantly in love with many of them, and just as quickly hate some others. Gon and Killua make for a fantastic and very balanced duo. I absolutely adore Netero, Kite, Bisky, Tsubone and many others. They stand out even at first, but the real magic happens with character development. You will come to feel for the villains, which are nothing like your standard regurgitated shonen tropes. Wait till you see Chrollo Lucifer or marvel at Meruem's transformation. Even the much aligned Bomber has his purpose (showing just how much crazier Gon is than a murderous maniac). The simplistic notions of villainy and heroism are cast aside, and what we get is a riveting psychological study of the rich tapestry of a world, whose every element is a living, breathing, and vibrant existence.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, the soundtrack and pacing could have been better at some points. But. This is eye-popping character design of Bleach (note: NOT character development, which Bleach lacks pretty much entirely), emotional intensity of Attack on Titan, strategic subtlety of Death Note, riveting fights of some of Naruto's best ones, and the intellectual depth that simply has no rivals in anime, unless you pick up a (really good) book. I really think this anime is the closest thing we have to the one, the true, the ultimate that this medium has to offer. Its few flaws become endearing, to the point that approaching the end of the series is the most dreaded part in the whole process. This is a masterpiece, and I simply can't see it being surpassed.",

Whenever my friend used to recommend watching it, I used to just ignore him, because I thought this was just another childish shounen.\r\nI could not have been more wrong. This is easily the best shounen and one of the greatest anime of all time.\r\nThe first arc is pretty decent, the only disadvantage here is that you have absolutely no idea what kind of crazy shit will happen later in the anime.\r\nThings get even better from the Heaven's arena arc onwards, and just when you think things can't get anybetter begins the YORKNEW CITY ARC, and that's where you realize that you are watching something truly incredible. Even the first two arcs, which seemed great, now seem like nothing due to the explosive growth in quality of the episodes. The ending song of this arc is my favourite ending of all time. \\n\\n\r\nBUT THE ESCALATION DOES NOT STOP HERE!\\n\\n\r\nNext comes the Greed Island Arc, which, believe it or not, is somehow EVEN BETTER than the previous arc. If you are a fan of the concept of players being sucked into a game and having to defeat it to escape, then this right here is the best arc in all of anime. If this arc was separately released as a standalone anime, it would have been hailed as the best anime of the \"isekai\" genre.\\n\\n\r\nNext comes the Chimera Ant Arc. It is a massive arc, covering a whopping 61 episodes. But not a single time do you feel bored or drowsy. Cause, guess what, it is even better than Greed Island. A massive number of new characters are introduced, all having their distinct personalities and ambitions, yet you never feel overwhelmed. The climax of the arc features many epic and jaw dropping battles, but something even more beautiful and great happens which I will not spoil. The only thing I will tell you is that the main antagonist is one of the greatest characters ever seen in  anime.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, this is one anime you must watch, and I really hope it gets a second season soon.\\n",

            "content": "This show was one that was long overdue for me to get around to and one I knew next to nothing about. I knew that it was considered one of the best shounens ever made with one of the most beloved power system put into anime and I was ready to dive into it.\r\nThe beginning 30~ episodes I guess you can classify as rough because what these episodes do is serve as the groundwork and pillars of the entire show so it can move as crazy as it needs to without bogging itself down with repetitive exposition. Hell I would kinda classify the first ~30episodes as rough, but the fight choreography and characters we get introduced to are more than enough to carry it.\\n\\n\r\nOnce the Heaven's arena arc finishing the training wheels come off and we fully see what HxH is and what it does. The cool thing about Nen to me was how fleshed out the system is. Nen is broken down into 6 main categories which every Nen user falls into for their applications of Nen. The user can train into other areas of Nen but those powers are never gonna be as powerful in comparison to their primary categories. Instead of Nen being nebulous in the way the user applies Nen the user's abilities tend to be directly tied to the character's personality or previous life experiences. This creates a really cool premise for it's fights where everyone is gonna play out differently than the last. In a way this system very much reminds me of stand battles in a way with the way that its never a numbers game its applications of the Nen abilities of the user and being able to outwit the other participant in the fight. In addition to the core pillars of Nen there are a lot of other applications that tend to use the \"storage of Nen\" but these things lend themselves to more support skills.\\n\\n\r\nThe way this story handles it's characters and conflicts is one of the highlights in a show where highlights are the norm. Instead of having the big bad vs the good guys for the fate of the world or whatever the characters just exist and cross paths. Sometimes in the story the overarching antagonist never even meets Gon or Killua the main character that we follow for 80% of the story. Any of the characters we follow always have their own goals, this goes for any of the perceive \"good guys\" and \"bad guys\". Everyone has their own motives for being at the setting where conflict breaks out.\\n\\n\r\nThe morality of the characters in this show undertones pretty much everything anyone does in the series. Gon is a shounen protagonist so by nature of that hes a paragon (heh) of good right? For the most part yes but a lot of the character conflicts come from Gon viewing the world as a black and white when it comes to moral ethics and not knowing what to do when faced with a situation that are as grey as they come. The phantom troupe while they serve as the group of baddies to go against our heroes, you have to remember characters have personality, motives, thoughts and relationships with their comrades and even enemies in the world of Hunter x Hunter. The troupe of their own set of interpersonal realtionships. A few of the troupe are long time friends, some of them hate some of the others in their group and some don't even know much about others. Each member of the phantom troupe has their own goal and motivations for joining the group but just by virtue of them joining the phantom thieves means they have the raw skill to be able to run it with the best group in the world of HxH that specializes in killing people.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhile I would love to talk about the crown jewel of the story: the chimera ant arc, I'm gonna exercise a bit of restraint on that because its one of the best arc in anime I've seen with probably my favorite antagonist of any story. Ever. \\n\\n\r\nNo part of the show feels under realized, the setting the characters, the ramifications of any action in the show or any of the references to real world history. While My Hero Academia sits at the throne for my favorite anime, Hunter x Hunter is eagerly waiting to take that spot away from it.",

            "content": "--- BEWARE THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS ---\r\nLemme just say that this series : Hunter X Hunter (2011) was a heck of a roller coaster ride!\r\nAt first I thought this was gonna be a childish show so for months this was sitting in my \"plan to watch\" pile, until one day I decided to give it a go. It started off slow but pretty soon started to give me a tingle of excitingafter a couple of episodes. Pretty soon, I was hooked onto this series and gave it my full attention almost every day. This series produced some of the most likable characters I've have ever seen on screen, like you could easily grow attached to some characters right away on their \"first appearance\" episode in the series. Even a lot of the background characters are remembered by me. If you think this series is childish because the main protagonist is a 12-year old then you are sadly mistaken. Throughout this series, Gon has shown great bravely and talent, quickly going up in the ranks and even standing tall and straight against strong and fearful opponents in fights (both ally, and enemy). But also this series may not be as bright as you think because things can get pretty dark in this anime. The fights were pretty good in this series, I could sometimes find myself so excited for the next episode just to see a fight finish. I try to keep this review as low on spoilers as possible so it is your decision to watch this series and get the bigger details such as the characters, fights, and etc. I hope you guys will choose to watch this series and enjoy it just as much or more than I did. Sayonara!\\n\\n\\n\r\nWatch this series if you are :\\n\r\n1.) Too lazy to watch those 300+ anime (I felt the amount of episodes for this series was perfect\\n\r\n2.) A person who like main character(s) who are not at the top of the pyramid (the strongest).\\n\r\n3.) A person who absolutely hates filler and wants pure plot (by the way, there are some recap episodes, which can be skipped if you do not want to watch em).\\n\\n\r\nBut...\\n\r\nBe warned there can be some episodes with lots of narration that makes the series feel slow, and the opening song is the same every epsiode but the EDs will make up for it.",

            "content": "Shounen anime are known power-ups which really makes no sense, the story behind it feels very weak and illogical, even going by the anime in questions; worlds physics and rules. It's just there to hype you up, make you excited and that in of itself is not a bad thing so to say. However, the build-up to this point, through the world, the character's is very important. This is something I would say Hunter x Hunter accomplishes very well and is one of the few who really managed to hit the right notes for this and so much more.\r\nStory\r\nIt starts out with centering around ayoung boy, named Gon who sets out on a journey to find his father. Sounds simple enough, but it's the journey to get there and how it does it, is what makes HxH quite special and amazing. For starters, the battles are interesting and fascinating which reflects the rules set up by this world and it does a great job of showing it to us. It's not as simple as he is the main character and he will win every battle without any real effort or trouble. Since it can, in fact, affect us emotionally.\\n\\n\r\nAt one point, you will be glued to the screen watching this young boy hunting his prey for his own goals and while he is doing so, you get to see and hear everything that is going through his head at the time, and it leaves you with his feeling of how dangerous this situation really is and how dire the consequences could become if he where to be detected by his prey. This is just one segment among many which are directed and told so well that you can't help but be glued to your screen watching this all unfold. However, there is more.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes it even more fascinating, is the fact that Gon is terrified while doing so, he is very aware that he could die if he were to mess this up and how his character portrays this, through his actions and emotions, is a job well done. He doesn't directly attack the enemy with a one-track mind, he actually strategies on how to hunt his prey. He learns all the ingredients necessary trough mother nature and other hunters he managed to catch a glimpse of doing his own thing.\\n\\n\r\nA big factor in most shounen anime is power, and Gon is not someone anyone normal would want to mess with, even adults. For his age of 12 years old, he is quite strong and fast, and you would rather avoid getting on his bad side if you know what's best for you. Though, being honest, if brute force was the only thing HxH had going for it, the popularity of it would make no sense. \\n\\n\r\nWe actually have another type of power and what makes it stand out from most of the others, is how complex and interesting it is. It's not as simple like just getting stronger, unlocking your potential, to mention some. It has its own categories which reflect the user's personality and depending on where you have lived, spent your times most, all of this is important in figuring out your type and which category it falls in. Gon is one you would list under Enhancer, these types tend to be simple and straightforward in their demeanour. \\n\\n\r\nThis focuses on the physical aspect of the user, his life energy and how to use it to achieve stronger and greater power. However, it's not that easy, if you were to mess it up, you could put your entire life in danger, you need to know how much to put in each of your attacks and this is not easy and puts our character's through gruelling and intense training segments to make them able to control this power more efficiently and figure out how you would want to use it. \\n\\n\r\nThere is more to this power, but if I were to delve further into it, this entire review would mostly just be focused around that. What I can say, is that at one point, the anime had a one-hour explanation for this power which was one of the most exciting and mesmerizing dialogue I heard in my all time watching anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nAs for sound, effects, music, it nails all those parts and gives you a great list of many amazing tracks you can't help but get addicted to, at least I was. It feels spot-on and does a great job of reflecting the overall atmosphere and feel of the anime. Like, it would make sense to get bored of listening to the same opening song, over and over, but the things are you don't and I can't describe properly \"why?\". First, you might start out disliking the opening (why would you, though?), yet after few times of listening to it, most persons would be addicted and can't stop listening. It also hits those nostalgia notes well if you are re-watching the anime. The same could also be said for the ending songs. \\n\\n\r\nThe effects are another thing which feels spot-on, not only is Madhouse great at using it, but also manipulating to give you the sense if a character is one assassin, you can barely hear his footsteps, when he runs you can't see sand blowing upward from the steps he takes. Action segments are no exception either, the hits or slashes among other things are done extremely well. Madhouse seriously outdid itself and deserves all the praise they get.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation is another big deal aspect to an anime and HxH, is one of the best and most consistent. I don't think there was even a moment when I was watching this anime I taught it looked terrible. Especially, during the fight scenes, it looks and feels amazing and you can't help but be drawn toward it. It's so fluid with some of the greatest sakuga I have seen. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, depending on the situations, Madhouse does a great job of adapting to it, like the facial expression at comedic or serious moments. Lightning, shading and colours adjustments, determined by the mood or tone of the situations or even the arc in question.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters \\n\\n\r\nJust having a good story or writing is not enough, for me at least. You need to love or hate the characters and I can safely assure you that HxH does an amazing job of executing them. They feel alive, quirky, noisy, and have a likeable personality which really makes it so you don't forget them easily or the individual's own name. HxH has a huge cast of characters and they all feel necessary to progress our main characters. \\n\\n\r\nGon at the start feels simple and straightforward, but as you move forward with the story you start to see flaws in him, I mean he is 12 years old so its logical, it would make sense to have some noteworthy issues which make him stand out, and make him more of interesting or annoying character, depending on which category you fall in. In fact, if he or the other character's where perfect it would be boring to follow such a main character, wouldn't you agree?\\n\\n\r\nMy favourite part about HxH, though, is the villains or antagonists. You start out with hating them when you learn what hell they put one of your main characters through but when you learn more about them, and you just can't help but like them.. and suddenly, you don't want them to be killed off but be incorporated in the story somehow, to maybe get them a main role in the story because they are just that much interesting and lovable and you can't help but be drawn to their silly nature and personality. \\n\\n\r\nIt also features one of my favoured antagonists, I started out with absolutely hating him and his one-track mind nature of being the best of them all. However, he was still just new to the world, and once he learns more and starts to interact with characters, which really challenged his original demeanour. I just couldn't help but really like him and not wishing death upon him. He is easily one of the most complex written antagonists and I seriously hope I can find more character's like him.\\n\\n\r\nYou will cry for them, you will hate them, you will love them.\\n\\n\r\nThe Negative\\n\\n\r\nThis anime deserves all the praise it gets, it's not perfect by any means, but probably close. However, just like any other series, it does come with some flaws which can make the viewer drop it or completely skip over it. For starters, it's very slow paced and takes it's time to build up. This is not an issue for me, but it might be for other persons, and if they were to stop watching. They will be skipping one amazing anime, which I think at one point, every anime watcher should give a try, it's just that worthy for me.\\n\\n\r\nDuring a certain very big arc, the pacing became even slower, the explanations for simple things, which could be shown through the animation and art making it more enjoyable is less visible and you get tons of unnecessary info dumping which could be skipped over or replaced with more interesting events. \\n\\n\r\nThis is my biggest flaw in the anime I don't know how the manga handles this but just in this regard, the anime did fail to satisfy me. However, this is becoming one tiny nitpick that is easily solved if you watch the anime in a binge. I am one of the persons who experience this arc in a weekly airing manner and it was not fun to sit through 20 minutes of an episode of not really seeing any real progression. Thankfully, I almost looked over this when I sat through the same arc for the second time.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\\n\r\nHunter x Hunter 2011 is one of a kind anime with some amazing and intelligent way to tell a good story, boasting some great and likeable characters. Not your typical shounen or anime with some awesome strategizing events and a power that is so complex and difficult to understand but is very fun to learn about, which totals up to my reason why this still stands strong as my favourite anime to this day and I urge everyone to give it a try, at some point in your life.\\n\\n\r\nActual: Overall Scores\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9.5/10 \\n\r\nCharacters: 9.7/10 \\n\r\nArt: 9.5/10\\n\r\nSound: 9/10 \\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10 \\n\r\nOverall: 9.7/10\\n\\n",

            "content": "I think one of the biggest things that keeps people from watching Hunter x Hunter is its length. They hear from everyone that it's great, but 148 episodes is a huge commitment. That was certainly my case before I watched it. However, after finishing it, I've reached the seemingly insane conclusion that Hunter x Hunter's length is not an obstacle.\r\nIts a strength.\r\nIf I were to sum up HxH's presentation in a word, it would be \"confident\". Half the writers in anime or manga wouldn't have the balls to attempt a lot of what happens in this show, especially in regards to how long certain arcsare. But they're never this long just because they can, but because that's how long they NEED to be in order to communicate what needs to get across. The writing in this show is good, and it knows that it's good, so it doesn't shy away from getting crazy.\\n\\n\r\nMy one regret in watching HxH is that I felt like I rushed a lot of it. There were some parts later on that I was pretty sure I was going to like, so I tried to get through earlier parts faster. In reality, all of HxH is excellent, just in different ways. The first arc in particular is seriously underrated. Which isn't to diminish how mind-blowingly fantastic the later arcs are, of course. Just don't forget, sometimes the journey along the way is more valuable that what lies at the end.\\n\\n\r\nWhat earns Hunter x Hunter its 10 out of 10, other than the aforementioned confidence, is that it has a variety of tones and knows how to use them. Earlier arcs are very light but have a sense of pure adventure with some of the best action beats in anime, while constantly throwing curveballs that keep it from getting even slightly predictable. Later arcs, particularly the Chimera Ant arc, lean far darker, becoming a compelling dive into the chaotic nature of conflict and how fundamentally an experience can change someone after just a brief period of time.\\n\\n\r\nMy preferred stories have always been ones that start with a distinct ending in mind and never lose sight of it, but Hunter x Hunter taught me to love the journey.",

            "content": "Trying not to spoil!!!\r\nStory 10/10\r\nCharacters 10/10\r\nHunter x hunter is anime that on  first look (especially the first episodes) looks as a typical shounen and even rather childish. We have our main hero, Gon who wants to find his father, is exceptional and gather friends along the way. However as the story progresses and I mean with the end of the first arc we start to notice that all the common shounen tropes get reversed. There is no nakama power, the reason the characters succeed is because of loses, hard work and friendship is not the only the reason for success. The main character, Gonis not anymore a typical shounen MC with great ideals and nature that tells him to save everybody. As the story progresses, it is revealed his hypocrisy and selfishness which makes him more human and relatable. The other two main characters, Leorio and Kurapika, have their own lives and goals, and do not follow Gon wherever he goes. The last main character aka Gon's new bff Killua is as complex as Gon himself. His development as human and the change of his ideals is one of the most exceptionable in the series. Even the villains are not typical. Most of the time they have nothing in common with the supposed MC's Gon  and Killua. The goals of the villains, especially in Kurapika's character development arc, are disturbed by the MC solely because they want to help Kurapika not because these villains may kill hundreds of people. The other antagonist, that can be considered MC since they appear in almost every arc, is driven by their personal desires for fighting and often is extremely contrasting with themselves. In this way the border between good and bad gets smudged and even the main characters can't be considered good people especially Gon. \\n\\n\r\nArt 9.5/10\\n\r\nThe art is not so outstanding but still amazing. Since the anime was started 2011 we could not expect the animation to be something out of this planet. However till its finish in 2014, the animation gets better and better. The last fights were so greatly animated that I had to watch them at least twice just because it was so flawless. The characters' feelings and thoughts can be tell just by looking at their eyes and body language. In overall in the beginning for me the art is 9/10 just because Madhouse thought that after so many years it wouldn't be so popular and they started with lower budged  and 10/10 for the progress in the animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\r\nThe OST of hunter x hunter is one of the greatest I have listened to. It is diverse and epic but also sad and evoking memories.  Also it was used to provoke emotions according to the scene. It cannot be described by words, it just have to be listened too.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10 or more\\n\r\nTill I watched it I have already abandoned the shounen genre because of the cliches and the overuse of everything. However hunter x hunter made me love every character even if they are \"bad\" or \"good\", all the characters had their own stories aside from the main story line and these stories were not abandoned. The shounen tropes got reversed and the story just became more, and more interesting. Also the feelings I felt and the feelings of the characters during the happy and sad moments were build up throughout the course of the story and were never without a reason or out of place. It was one of the few anime that made me cry like a baby and make me sweat with tension. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, without spoiling, hunter x hunter is one fresh anime in the shounen genre. With its complex relatable characters, with bad/good being smudged together, interesting storyline, great ost and mostly outstanding animation, hunter x hunter is one enjoyable emotional rollercoaster which will keep you entertained till the end.  \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "This anime. THIS. ANIME. \r\nStory: (9) \r\nThe story starts off lighthearted, jovial, and almost with a Pok\u00e9mon-ish vibe to it. Like Gon, our main character, the story starts off na\u00efve and hopeful. Don't let the beginning fool you. \r\nAn aspect I really enjoyed about the story was how easily and smoothly the show could shift from light to dark and then suddenly back to light. It was almost eerie in a way. Like how babies or dolls sometimes seem scary in all their happy cuteness. \r\nGoing into this show, I wasn't very impressed. Frankly, I was expecting more because of all the praise surrounding it.Overall, however, as I began to watch more, I realized the anime definitely lived up to its praise. Two wonderfully crafted arcs include the Yorknew City Arc and the Chimera Ant Arc (particularly the Chimera Ant Arc; if you've done some research into the show, you've likely heard of it). \\n\\n\r\nThe complexity and sheer masterful writing in the arcs I mentioned were so brilliant, both contrasting and complementing the more training-oriented, lighter arcs which I definitely enjoyed. \\n\\n\r\nSound: (9)\\n\\n\r\nI love anime openings and unfortunately, the opening song does not change. Ever (though the animation for the openings do) However, this almost works for the anime in a way, acting almost as an identity associated with the anime (so when you watch the last episode, you'll be feeling nostalgia and likely singing along to the all-too familiar song). \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack itself, however, is amazing. I love the Zoldyck family theme, and I adored the endings in particular. They suited the anime well and were composed beautifully. \\n\\n\r\nThere's quite a bit of controversy surrounding this topic, but I'll bring it up anyway: I do believe the character theme soundtracks are better suited to the characters now than in the 1999 version. I adored Killua's theme, which effectively summarized his internal emotions, his upbringing as a puppet of darkness, and his desire to be freed from his family and the burden of being heir to an assassin family. It was melancholic, thought-provoking, and eerie. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: (10)\\n\\n\r\nThis is the key factor that resulted in such a high rating for the anime. The sheer complexity of the characters baffle me, especially in regards to Gon and Killua, and their relationship. I can tell you now that if you go into the anime expecting Gon to be a typical shounen hero (i.e. Natsu, Naruto, Luffy), you'll be surprised. I love the multi-dimensions of the main characters and their backstories, their unpredictability and uniqueness. \\n\\n\r\nThe side characters are also memorable and intriguing (the intrigue of the Zoldyck family, the Chimera Ant King and his Royal Guard), and there is intensely well-done development on part of Killua and some others. \\n\\n\r\nMost importantly, the deconstruction of a typical shounen hero was my favourite part of the main character, Gon. He starts off as a seemingly typical shounen hero, happy, optimistic, and stubborn, with a set goal in mind and a relentless desire to get stronger. When tragedy strikes, however, we get to see a darkness in him that I haven't seen in other shounen heroes before, and it has you questioning who's really the villain or hero of the story. I adored that complexity. There are other aspects that deconstruct typical shounen protagonists as well, such as the instances where Gon's selfishness shows out as a result of his stubbornness and set goals. \\n\\n\r\nKillua, who I'd classify as the deuteragonist (or even another protagonist), is such a contrast to Gon that it's riveting. Since he's my favourite character, I could talk about his development all day. But I'll save you the long and tedious read for perhaps another time. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall: (10)",

Though whenever I tried to recommend this anime to my friends, I have to start with saying ''basically it is about a kid looking for his dad and the journey starts, first he attends the hunter exam....'' and BANG, people started to ask me shut up at this point. Alright I know the plot of HXH sounds so childish, but just wait a second and give it a try. I am certain it will amaze you in less than 10 episodes, at least before the hunter exam is finished. The relationships (mainly friendship) between the main characters, the setting ofthe hunter world, the battle of wits during Greed Island and the kidnap. This is the ONLY anime I can never put of feelings into words. You've got to watch it, feel it by yourself, and I can assure you the enjoyment at the hunter world is unique compared to other anime. \\n\r\nHXH - details more stunning than the plot itself. Believe it. I loved it when I was 13, and I am still watching the manga and re watching the anime now (I am currently 28).",

We are introduced to new characters throughout the entire show and none of their stories are fully flushed out. There are often times when the main story line has something interesting happening, but then for 3-4 episodes we are stuck watching random side charactersover think minor details. By the time we get back to the main story all the tension that kept you on the edge of your seat is gone and the resolution is often anti-climatic. \\n\\n\r\nYou know a show is poorly written when they have to waste minutes and sometimes even entire episodes to actually explain why a certain action would have the consequence that it does. A good show would set up the conditions for its \"magic\" and then through action show what happens.\\n\\n\r\nExample: Death Note. We are told about the rules of the notebook and then through out the show we see it put to action. The narration doesn't have to literally tell us that killing certain people will result in the protagonist being discovered as a murders. We are trusted as an audience to just know that.  In Hunter X Hunter we are held by the hands and literally told what the consequences of an action would be, nothing is left for the viewer to figure out.",

            "content": "NO SPOILER!!!\r\nThe first word that comes to mind when I think about Hunter x Hunter is undoubtedly: VARIETY. With everything from insane, heart-raising action to comedy so ridiculous that I laugh alone in my room on numerous occasions; Hunter x Hunter is an anime that quickly shot to my number 1 favorite and only secures it's place more determinedly with every episode.\r\nAt this point, although still ongoing, I'm roughly halfway through HxH and I've loved every single minute of it. That's because in this show, every minute matters. You can't look away without missing something crucial, hilarious or just generally entertaining. I was a latecomer to the HxH bandwagon and after around 10 episodes, I was sorely angered with myself for leaving it this late. All I can say now is thank heavens I finally gave this anime a shot. NEWCOMERS. DO NOT BE PUT OFF BY THE LENGTH. WHEN YOU START WATCHING; IT DOESN'T EVEN MATTER ANYMORE. Where I first found myself concerned as to whether I'd have the time or motivation to catch up with this anime, I now find myself worried about catching up and having to wait a week for each episode! And man, do those episodes fly by. The best anime are the ones that make it impossible to say 'okay, that's enough for now'. \\n\\n\r\nThe array of interesting and unique characters is what really makes this series. HxH is not afraid to go with the cliche, make fun of the cliche, experiment with the dark and creepy, the light and fluffy, and everything in between. With 2 adorable yet terrifyingly powerful protagonists and their ever-changing company, you're guaranteed to come across multiple characters that you love, hate or just plain can't get your head around. But even without the constantly growing cast, Gon and Killua really do make this a special anime. Watching the two grow (albeit quite quickly with the pace of the anime) and experiencing all the WONDERS OF FRIENDSHIP AND SELF DISCOVERY is easily the main reason for my love of this anime. Not forgetting, of course, creepy-ass perv Hisoka on the side is just the cherry on the cake.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime is just plain fun. It's addictive, interesting, varied and entertaining in every sense of the word. It really is an anime that has something for everyone. WATCH IT.",

But the main question is... why? Can an anime whose main character is a kid wearing green clothes with childish aspect be a masterpiece? Oh yes.\r\nThe best point about Hunter x Hunter is the fact that this anime avoids all the typical shonen cliches. In this anime you\u2019ll find unexpected deaths, realistic fights, an amazing character development and, the best of all: it never gets boring.\r\nI\u2019m not even joking, one of themain arcs is about president elections... and it\u2019s fun and entertaining! \\n\\n\r\nTalking about the fight scenes, I can\u2019t say anything but awesome. In my opinion, Hunter x Hunter has the best fights in all the anime (the fight between Netero and Meruem is simply spectacular) and the animation helps a lot this anime to be epic and dynamic. \\n\\n\r\nAnother incredible aspect, is the OST, being childish and innocent at the beginning and dark and mature at the end. \\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion, HxH is now one of the main pillars in the anime industry, an absolute masterpiece that you can\u2019t miss.\\n\\n\r\n10/10\\n",

            "content": "Hunter x Hunter.\r\nHonestly i think that this is the one of the most enjoyment i have had watching an anime from the past few years. i will start off this review with a 'no spoiler mark'.\r\nWith that out of the way i can confidently say that if you gonna watch an anime that had come out in the last few year, add Hunter X Hunter on that list.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nHunter x Hunter's story is very simple. It Start off with our main character out on a quest to become a hunter and looking for his father. As with most action - shounen, the story is splitin to arcs, avg at about 21 episode each, tho some are more lengthy then others, for the most part the pacing is great when compare to most action - shounen. You are not going to see a mind bending twist in this anime, but the story is great and serve its purpose, it give the characters a goals and a sense of progression.\\n\\n\r\nArt : 8/10\\n\r\nThe art looks great in HxH Madhouse did a fantastic job (as always) with this one, everything from the world to the characters themselves. the only knocks i had with the art is ( and its not entirely the studio's fault ) it then to drive out people that are not use to see this type of art style after the 90's away. a lot of my friends simply just turn away from the show after the first few episode just because they can't stand the art style.  \\n\\n\r\nSound : 9/10\\n\r\nThe sound in HxH was great. the voice actors did a superb job at most scenes and they did a good job at getting out the emotion of their characters. the tracks are great but with the exception of the intro and ending songs, it can get repetitive for some, altho i don't mind them. Even tho the intro song ''Departure!'' by ''Ono Masatoshi'' it the only intro song throughout 148 episode it did not get repetitive because they did a great job at changing to different part of the songs and the intro animation for each arcs. All of the endings is quite good as-well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 10/10\\n\r\nNow this is where HxH shine more then most anime, i can not remember the last time i had watched an anime with as good character development as Hunter x Hunter. This show just did it better then any show that i can remember, sure the main cast start off as generic anime prototypes kids, but that is what makes it so good, they are kids, that still have alot to learn about the worlds around them. The characters feel natural, you understand what they are doing and why, you start off knowing almost everything about everyone and under stand their action almost immediately. And as the series progresses so do they, you get to see how they have mature and change. Every action have a consequences, you pick a fight with someone who has been doing noting but battle with the best for his entire life?  you may be lucky if you can escape after a huge humiliation and few broken bones, no cheep power-ups during combat from a legendary demon that lives inside you Bullc***. It made the anime more believable and relate able. you under stand what makes and brakes them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 10/10\\n\r\nWith the simple over arc story light tune art and excellent sound makes this anime very enjoyable to watch. the only nip pick i have with it is later on in the show there was a 4-5 stretch where is was kinda ''meh'' but that is nip picking as its bestest of forms.\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 9/10\\n\r\nThe Characters in this anime is it's main strong point, the main characters, the side characters. have lots of dept. the main cast character development throughout the story is outstanding, and some side characters from this anime is so strong that it may even outclass most of the main characters from some anime in the past years in dept and design. beside the characters this anime add noting new to the table in terms of.. well everything else. But it did them great, it just did not push any boundary. I recommencement you give it a try if you don't mind the art and liked any anime... at all.",

            "content": "I will try not to spoil anything, though it's hard to get my points across without explaining a few things...\r\nStory-There is not one person who has grazed the story of Hunter x Hunter that has watched it and said \"I hate this anime\". This may surprise some of you who have only seen the opening and maybe watched the first episode.\r\nFrom first watch, and after watching the first four episodes, this anime may seem to feel like any other shonen: You've got the main male character who is goofy and underestimated but is really powerful. You've got the adventure and the search to become somethingmore powerful (the \"Gotta Catch em All\" syndrome). And, at first, it seems the main character can do no wrong.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some things we just expect from shonen. And there are some things about Hunter x Hunter that can remind you of other shonens.\\n\\n\r\nBut there are far greater differences between this anime and other shonens. I would even compare it to Seinen if the episodes didn't carry an element of youth (not the kind of youth people would expect though).\\n\\n\r\nIf you are someone that is open to main characters who are kids and you're looking for a happy, light adventure story, stop this anime after episode 4. If you are looking for something deeper, something horrific, and something that jerks your heart strings, KEEP WATCHING.\\n\\n\r\nYou may think I'm saying that Hunter x Hunter offers something for everyone. Really and truly, it doesn't. But it does happen to draw in a few suckers who are looking for something light and who have never watched a horror in their life only to destroy their dreams.\\n\\n\r\nIt is no wonder why this version of the anime doesn't have the strongest fanbase. It doesn't have any fan service (no real love story) and it is very close to the manga in its adaptation. Shouldn't these things make it popular? Well, at first glance, Hunter x Hunter seems like all the others. Closed-minded people will write it off before it even gets past episode 1 because it seems like such a cliche anime, with the upbeat opening and the young kids hopping and skipping everywhere.\\n\\n\r\nBut trust me. It is not what it seems.\\n\\n\r\nFor lovers of shonen, this may not feel as fun for them. It doesn't deliver the same way most shonens do. In most shonens, the main character's goal is to be the master of some sort or to get revenge or avenge someone else. Therefore, fighting is usually a consistent theme in most shonen (Though I'd question Princess Tutu). But in this shonen, the main character's goal was not to become a master in any way. He was only trying to find his father. Thus, fighting was only an asset to achieving what he wanted, but not mandatory. The story was focused on teaching Gon the realities of being a hunter and the truth about the way his father lived, who was also a hunter.\\n\\n\r\n(From the synopsis, you might not know just how deep and scary this story is. This story put me right back into the horror genre I was trying to avoid. It feels like the genre follows me like a plague.)\\n\\n\r\nThe first arc focuses on this Hunter Exam, where Gon meets many of his friends throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the arcs are deeper and more involved. I can't really get into detail about them because I don't want to give too much away. It would be hard to describe them without giving too much away and I want you readers to really enjoy this anime. It's worth it. Trust me, you'll stay up late trying to stuff 90 episodes into one day.\\n\\n\r\nThe arcs include: The Hunter exam arc, the Zoldyc Family arc, the Heavens Arena Arc, Yorknew City Arc, Greed Island Arc, Chimera Ant Arc, and the 13th Hunter Chairman Election Arc. There is supposed to be one more arc but the creator has gone on a hiatus. He goes on hiatus several times throughout the manga and anime runs. The newest arc is supposedly called the Dark Continent Arc. \\n\\n\r\nEvery arc is different which makes it anything but repetitive, unlike most shonen.\\n\\n\r\nThe lightest arc is obviously the Heavens Arena arc. The deepest and darkest is the Chimera Ant arc, though I found Yorknew City to be a close second.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is a mixture of Dragonball Z and Attack on Titan as far as story goes. I really didn't come in expecting much of anything in particular, but I was told to expect the anime to get darker. But I did not expect it to get as dark as it got.\\n\\n\r\nBut you know, I've seen worse. Shonen anime isn't on the level of other horror  genres. The themes of friendship and the feeling that the main character will save the day somehow makes this anime one step away from being a like horror genres I've watched, especially in Seinen. (Sometimes they can be so horrific for just no reason. La Chavelier D'Eon did it for me. That completely took me out of the horror genre.)\\n\\n\r\nFor an anime that is 148 episodes long, not one episode feels out of place, unnecessary, or dragging. In fact, the pacing of this anime is smooth and even throughout, surprisingly. I found myself wanting more, feeling like the anime was too short! 148 episodes really isn't enough! This anime has a way of making the viewer want to know what happens next because most of us know we will get the answers we want in the next episode. It doesn't waste time getting to the juicy stuff. The story is engaging throughout, covering many different emotions from the viewer: anger, sadness, happiness, fear, platonic love, and overall contentment.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes this anime different from other shonen is that it doesn't have any fan service or any episodes that are non-cannon. In other words, no \"filler\" episodes. Surprising for an 148 episode anime, right?\\n\\n\r\nThe story takes place in many places according to the arc. This is an adventure story, so obviously the main character never stays in one place. The main character is from Whale Island, a small island with a humble village. But it is not the only place we see more than once, so it makes the adventure refreshing and puts the animation to good use.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters-The main character is Gon, a rustic but flexible boy who is determined to be a hunter and find his father who abandoned him shortly after he was born. Though this character is the main character, he is not always the main focus throughout every arc. That makes him different from other shonen anime characters.\\n\\n\r\nThere are four other main supporting characters: Killua, his best friend from a family of assassins, Kurapika, his friend from the Kurta Clan, a clan of people with violet eyes, and Leorio, a young man who looks way too old and has a desire to be a doctor.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are nothing particularly special. They are the typical characters you'd find in anime. Gon is the over-optimistic, honest boy who is super strong. Killua and Kurapika carry on Tsundere traits and make up for where the other is absent. Leorio is the character that provides comic relief (he reminds me of Kogoro Mouri from Detective Conan).\\n\\n\r\nHowever, all characters show evolution, even if the evolution is small. Though they may be typical, things happen to them that test their personalities. Despite the fact that Gon is typical of most shonen, for example, his simple personality often has serious consequences throughout the anime. He is not as perfect as other shonen anime characters. Gon has moments where he loses and there is nothing he can do about it. He has moments where he is not strong enough to fight, where someone else wins where he fails. There are those in this anime that ARE stronger than him. And that is what makes his character so unbelievably tolerable for viewers who would normally despise such characters. It is that little slice of life that brings a wide range of fans to the anime.\\n\\n\r\n(This anime has a way of making up for the weaknesses in most shonen anime.)\\n\\n\r\nMany characters are introduced throughout every arc. Many of them become very important throughout the adventure. But just because they are friends of the main character, super strong, or important to the story doesn't mean they won't die. That's right. It doesn't mean they won't die...for good, too. Often times, things happen to characters in this anime that Gon, the main character, can never save.\\n\\n\r\nIt's best for the viewers not to become too attached to characters in this anime. You never know which cool character will be killed next, and sometimes in the most gruesome way. At the end of this anime, you will never smile again.\\n\\n\r\nStill, it's so hard NOT to become attached, and that brings me to this anime's greatest let-downs: character background development and the usage of characters.\\n\\n\r\nSome of the characters are treated as if they are expendable. Some characters are designed to show off awesome abilities and yet they fail to deliver, or some are put out there to be more important than they end up being. Two examples would be Baise and Pokkle. The female characters, as usual, showed the least evolution.\\n\\n\r\nStill, at least the female characters were actually powerful and cool...That's more than I can say about other shonen anime.\\n\\n\r\nLeorio, who is supposed to be considered one of the main characters, showed the least evolution, and ended up being a one-dimensional character. His evolution was worse than the characters who showed no relation to the main character.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I understand this story is about Gon's father, but they copped out when it came to revealing information about Gon's mother, which could've been useful to his overall development.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, let me get down to the villains. Oooh, the juicy villains. Generally, there was a new antagonist every arc. The main antagonist, who seems to show up in most arcs, is Hisoka. Yea, he's a creep. Some of you might even think of him as a fruitcake, but I think that only adds to the fact that his overall presence is taboo. There is a lot more given to him than the Hunter Exam arc, however, his overall backstory wasn't developed enough. He is another character that I wished was elaborated on.\\n\\n\r\nThe most well-developed villain was the Chimera Ant King. He was from the most intense arc in the whole series and really his presence is unseen in shonen anime. Still, I wanted to know a little about his life \"before\" he was born, which could've been useful in the arc. You'd need to watch the series to know what I really mean.\\n\\n\r\nThen there is the Phantom Troupe which inspired a Hunter x Hunter movie outside of the series. The troupe consists of a collection of merciless thieves. Really cool characters with awesome powers, but again, no real emphasis on their backgrounds.\\n\\n\r\nDespite all of the things I wished were elaborated on, the characters were developed enough. It's hard not to understand or connect with the characters. Each character served their purpose in each arc, which was all that was needed to keep the story flowing. The story had a power all its own. The viewers are left valuing characters even stronger because so many could be lost within one episode, even characters that were amazing. Any character that was unimportant didn't last too long. Even some of the lead characters often had moments where they were excluded from the entirety of an arc if they were not considered important. But there wasn't one character that was just garbage. Still, some characters would've been a lot more interesting had their pasts been elaborated on.\\n\\n\r\nThe fact some characters weren't elaborated on within this series doesn't take away from the anime at all. In fact, it just adds to the anime's appeal. The anime has plenty of room to elaborate on characters that it didn't so far. The rumor is that the manga artist is just on a temporary hiatus. Who knows what the next couple of arcs or episodes will reveal. There is so much that can be worked into Hunter x Hunter without it ever really feeling like it's dragging on. It just has that feeling. It feels like the adventure can never truly end. The way the story is set up makes it feel like the main character will always have an adventure and will always meet people. And I'm okay with that, unlike with animes like Pokemon, Detective Conan, DragonBall Z, and even Naruto. This anime truly can never get old, really. I guess because no arc is the same as the last. There is nothing repetitive about this anime. There is just so much to explore with the hunters, there is no possible way it can truly run out of ammunition.So, I'm not too disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nStill, there are some characters I really hope to learn more about in the future.\\n\\n\r\nThe 1999 version was better at developing the characters, but it's not as close to the manga. And that is a must for me.\\n\\n\r\nMusic-The musical scores are epic. Much of the instrumentals really capture the sense of adventure you might feel in the anime. However, the opening song, which is consistent throughout the series, is so upbeat it seems to hide the darkness of the story. But actually, that is exactly why this opening is the best.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending songs vary according to the arc and better fits with the arc it ends to.\\n\\n\r\nCreator and Inspiration-The writer and illustrator of Hunter x Hunter, Yoshihiro Togashi, also wrote and illustrated YuYu Hakusho (for those of you who remember that anime; it's good, too) and Level E (also really good, but underrated). He's married to the woman who created Sailor Moon.\\n\\n\r\nHunter x Hunter, the original manga and anime, were released in 1998.\\n\\n\r\nThe artist had a hobby of collecting all sorts of objects and so wanted to make an anime that involved collecting. The name \"Hunter x Hunter\" was inspired from the Japanese show Downtown where the hosts of the popular variety show often repeated words for comedy.\\n\\n\r\nThe birth of the artist's first son influenced much of his work regarding Gon.\\n\\n\r\nThe writer/author of the series is very hard on his work, often apologizing for his \"poor artwork.\". Because he doesn't hardly have any assistance with his work, he doesn't have anyone to finish for him when things come up in his life. He goes on several hiatuses for long extended periods of time. He went on hiatus in 2012, came back in 2014, and then went on hiatus two months after returning.\\n\\n\r\nDragonball Z was actually one of the inspirations behind much of the elements in Hunter x Hunter. It was the popular anime at the time.\\n\\n\r\nOne obvious character that is inspired from a creature in DBZ is the Chimera Ant King. The Chimera Ant King was inspired from Cell from Dragonball Z. He has the stinger on his tail, the green-ish body, and the black finger-nail polish. He also has an affinity for games, just like Cell did (remember the Cell games?). The King is also some higher cellular form that was meant to be invincible, just like Cell.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation-The animation is well-drawn. The details, like the forests, bodies of water, and creatures, all show lushness. The coloring captures the tone of the anime well, from the lighter moments to the darkest moments. Everything is felt, unlike in the 1999 version where everything felt colorless and lifeless.\\n\\n\r\nAdaptations-There are two anime adaptations of the Hunter x hunter manga. There is a 1999 version and a 2011 version of this anime. Of the two, most fans say the 1999 version was darker, but it was not as true to the manga as the 2011 anime was. I feel that the 2011 version is darker in content, even though the coloring is brighter. I advise you watch the 2011 version first and if you feel like you just can't get enough, head on over to the 1999 version. Of the two, I prefer the 2011 version. I like adaptations that are closer to the original story. Then we can see the true artist's intentions.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I haven't seen all of the 1999 version, but this review is mostly for the 2011 version. But so far based on what I've seen, there are significant differences:\\n\\n\r\n1) The 1999 version drags on more than the 2011 version. The 2011 version has a quicker pace and jumps right into the action each arc.\\n\\n\r\n2) The 2011 version follows the manga closer than the 1999 version.\\n\\n\r\n3) The animation in the 2011 version is obviously more up-to-date but the 1999 version gives a feeling of nostalgia.\\n\\n\r\n4) The 1999 version is darker. I suppose it's because the visuals are not as lush as they are in the 2011 version. The 1999 version also has darker themes that come from the fillers and the humor is edgier. But in content, the 2011 version is actually less censored despite what fans say. It also is less humorous than the 1999 version, believe it or not, and is sadder and more sentimental, making it feel more serious. Some feel like they can take the 1999 version more seriously because the main character isn't as righteous, but he is more of a comedian than in the 2011 version\\n\\n\r\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/HunterXHunter/comments/1rxhwh/censorship_in_the_1999_anime_vs_censorship_in_the/\\n\\n\r\n5) The 2011 version actually covers all the arcs that have currently been created, whereas the 1999 version ended after the Yorknew City arc and then there are some OVAs about Greed Island. It is missing one of the deepest arcs in the series, the Chimera Ant arc.\\n\\n\r\n6) The 1999 version has stronger character development than the 2011 version.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I think this anime was fantastic. I recommend this anime to all anime lovers, though I know many who are interested in the Shoujo or Shonen genre may not be able to handle all of the gore and atypical endings. Still, it has a really good story and the characters are interesting. I doubt this anime could disappoint any viewers...Unless, you're a Negative Nancy about everything.\\n\\n\r\nI give this anime a 9.5/10. It actually may deserve a 10 out of 10, but the simplicity of the characters don't make the characters stand out the best out of other shonen anime. I was also disturbed about the abandonment of many characters. It left me feeling a bit empty, like there were holes left untouched in the story. I really hope they clean this up in future arcs. I would like many characters, especially the ones considered important, to be touched on a little more.",

            "content": "Hunter \u00d7 Hunter (Which will hereafter be referred to as H\u00d7H) is an action/adventure series produced by Studio Madhouse and adapted from the manga of the same name by Yoshihiro Togashi. This is the second anime adaptation of H\u00d7H, the first being done by Nippon Animation, which was divided into multiple contiguous parts by OVA (Original Video Animation) that continued the story from where the original series ended. This was done because the manga is still ongoing and the studio needed to wait for the author to publish more chapters to continue adapting the material. This new series, coming much later than the original, startsfrom the very beginning of the manga and discards everything about the original anime, and as such it doesn't have any issues the original had. They both cover the same material, but this adaption manages to go much further in the story. I haven\u2019t seen the original series and thus cannot comment on the quality of it, but I can tell you this newer adaptation is easily one of the best manga to anime adaptations I have ever seen, and any fan of ongoing series aimed at the younger male demographic will find a lot to enjoy here.\\n\\n\r\nH\u00d7H stars Gon, a gifted young boy living on Whale Island. Gon was left on Whale Island by his father, Ging, to live with his Aunt Mito. This is because Ging is what is known as a Hunter, a special rank that allows him to travel the world and use the resources of the Hunter Organization to aid his \u201chunt.\u201d There are many different kinds of Hunters which you\u2019ll see throughout the show, and the first part of the series focuses on Gon\u2019s quest to become a Hunter himself. To do this, he must obtain a Hunter\u2019s License, but doing so won\u2019t be easy. Early on, he\u2019s joined by a few friends. Leorio, a tall young man who is always seen in a business suit and wishes to become a Hunter for monetary gain. Kurapika, a young man from the Kurta tribe who wishes to avenge his people. And finally Killua, a boy the same age as Gon who also seems to be incredibly gifted. All four of them are trying to become Hunters for their own reasons, and the focus on each of them shifts throughout the entire 148 episodes. Side characters also occasionally get a piece of the limelight, but this is always a temporary situation that changes from arc to arc. The series also has somewhat of a main antagonist that is present in almost every arc, but this character isn't purely evil and his role isn't even entirely antagonizing Gon and his friends. All of the characters are enjoyable for the most part, although some of the side characters can be a bit bland, notably the main villain in an arc during the middle of the series. This is an uncommon problem though, and for the most part you\u2019ll enjoy the characters populating the screen whether they be good or bad.\\n\\n\r\nThe music and animation in H\u00d7H is excellent as well. The soundtrack is composed mostly of orchestral music, and it has a very exciting and fun feeling to it. During the more serious scenes, it also manages to set the mood right, although many pieces end up being used quite a bit due to the long length of the show. This extends to the opening which only features changes in animation and occasionally the lyrics of the song being different. It\u2019s still the same song throughout, however, so you may end up getting sick of it by the end and wish to skip it. The animation amazingly manages to stay consistent over all 148 episodes. For a series of this length, it looks surprisingly good, and Madhouse should be lauded for managing to keep the animation and art quality so high over such a long run. The actions scenes in the show are blazing fast and look fantastic, and the slower parts look equally as good with little motion going on. Although I found there are very few points where the animation manages to overly impress, the standard set through the entire run is impressive and should be very pleasing for the viewers watching.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, there are a few areas where H\u00d7H falters. My biggest gripe with the series was the inconsistent tone between the first and second half. The first 70 or so episodes are all fairly light-hearted, barring the occasional violent moment, but the second half pulls out all the stops and becomes brutal both with its themes and the violence depicted. The change in tone is very sudden and will either be a breath of fresh air from the previous arcs, or a huge disappointment if you really enjoyed everything from before and didn't want it to change. I personally enjoyed the mature shift in tone, but I also wasn't the biggest fan of the first 70 episodes. They were enjoyable for me, but not to the point that I really loved the series. The last half really did it for me, but your mileage may vary. Unfortunately, the final arc also has some pacing issues. There is an all-out battle where several characters are fighting separately towards a common goal, and during this portion, the pacing is very grating. Certain minor characters end up overstaying their welcome, which really dampened my enjoyment of these episodes. The events that happen are still interesting, I just wish they could have condensed this part so it didn't go on for as long, but I was otherwise pleased with how everything else went. Another thing that may hamper your enjoyment is that the manga H\u00d7H is still ongoing, and as such this anime adaption does not cover the entire story. Luckily though, Madhouse still managed to end things on a satisfying note, so even if you never see more H\u00d7H after this, you will still get a sense of finality, albeit with a few loose ends not tied up. Another point that may turn you off to H\u00d7H is the various plot holes and bizarre story elements. The story for H\u00d7H is unfortunately a bit of a weak point, and at times the author employs narrative devices that feel cheap and don\u2019t really make sense in the context of what\u2019s going on. I found this to be a relatively minor problem until the final arc where a certain character is introduced that is completely broken in terms of what they are capable of. Again, it\u2019s a pretty minor problem, but not one I can ignore.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, H\u00d7H is an enjoyable experience marred by a few problems. It\u2019s definitely worth watching if it interests you, but the experience is not perfect. A show of this quality definitely deserves attention, so give it a shot if it seem up your alley.",

            "content": "I have started rewatching anime a several months ago , since a fairly long break ; since the good ol childhood days. Meanwhile scrolling through shows to watch i have discovered a nostalgia re-run vaguely obvious in front of me which was the reboot of the highly acclaimed Hunter X Hunter series , and got involved into it for the sake of reliving those innocent days in a new purely wrapped version which made me discover it even further because of the scale of events it covered in its source material manga.\r\nThe story as far as we notice is a formidable competently written piece ofliterature that starts with the enormous world full of wonders and unique humans called HUNTERS , our main protagonist Gon is our viewpoint of the entirety of this world until he achieves his only goal in life which is to meet his father which is a Hunter who left Gon in his earlier days. \\n\r\nHowever Gon's goal to meet his father is filled with adventures and thrills of different sorts meshed together in a very appealing manner along with the lovable mysterious characters along the road.\\n\\n\r\nThe main standouts of the story is the constant pace variation and intellectual potential of arc arrangement and the build up of events and characters , the show has acclaimed a high standard of mentality while dealing with events and battles that seem basic but truly has a deep reasonable eccentric credibility compared to any other shounen anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIll sum up the art and sound in one go..\\n\r\nThe sounds in HxH are completley vague and each character has his own Vibe and backround music that fits perfectly. And the idea of a constant Opening song with different animations is a true wonder that makes you attached to it and gives you sincere motivation of some sort.\\n\r\nThe art is just Gorgeous and bright-fully colored compared to the original series which was darker.\\n\\n\r\nHunta X Hunta !! summed up is a action based comedic gray show that has no particular goal but focuses on the journey itself , mind me on this -- the show has no goal but the characters do or try to acclaim one atleast , which gives the show an enormous ambiguity and a fantastic potential to expand the story in all different directions and deviations due to the unexplored universe and hidden character potentials and the most intellectual 100+ shounen out there. Hit it up and you wont be dissapointed :)\\n\\n\r\nP.S : Get well soon Togashi , we need more of this.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading this rushed review :P \\n",

            "content": "-Ayumey Spoiler Free Review-\r\nIF YOU THINK THAT THIS IS A KID SHOW OR IF YOU HAVE ANY DOUBTS WHETER IF YOU SHOULD WATCH HUNTER X HUNTER READ BELOW, OTHERWISE READ ANYWAYS.\r\nIf you for some weird reason want the review in Swedish here it is:\r\nhttp://imgur(dot)com/a/RrxDL\r\nFirst, let me begin by saying that I was very surprised that I convinced myself to watch the first episode. It all started a year ago, when my fellow Swedish buddy told me about Hunter x Hunter and recommended me to watch it.\r\nMy response was something like this.\r\n-It doesn\u2019t look good.\r\n-It won\u2019t fit me.\r\n-I\u2019ll put it into my plan to watch list(with a mindset that I\u2019d never actually watch it).\\n\\n\r\nIt wasn\u2019t until November 29th this year on a regular boring Tuesday that I realized that I was wrong all along. It\u2019s at times like these that you realize how easily you misjudge things instead of looking and trying it out and to be honest I felt a bit embarrassed with myself. I can wholeheartedly say that Hunter x Hunter is one of the best shows that I\u2019ve ever watched, whether if it\u2019s an anime or whatever. So, what I\u2019m trying to accomplish here is to open the eyes of those who thought just like I did and to give this anime a review that it truly deserves.\\n\\n\r\nStory: I\u2019ll go through this somewhat quick since most of you probably already knows this from the synopsis or perhaps reading someone else\u2019s review. Anyways, after being abandoned by his father as a young boy, our main character Gon goes on an adventure to find him as well as becoming a Hunter to understand what made it more appealing for his father to become a hunter instead of raising and be there for his own son.\\n\r\n However, Gon is not alone on this adventure as he meets a lot of new friends as well as enemies on his journey. The show builds up a lot on friendship and becoming stronger overtime. It\u2019s not a show where the main character deals with every problem unhurt, it\u2019s quite the opposite since Gon fails more than he succeeds. After being such a long anime I don\u2019t think it damages the story at all and there aren\u2019t really any filler episodes. I can agree with some people that the Chimera Ant arc is relatively slow from time to time, however I don\u2019t think that there is too much to complain about as it\u2019s more of a minor issue, the beginning looks very promising and you get some real kickass episodes toward the end.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Hunter x Hunter consists of a bunch of different characters and in my opinion they managed to create them almost perfectly, it\u2019s one of the stronger sides to this anime. Although that the spotlight is on Gon and Killua, I feel that they really succeeded to create unique and promising characters with strong personalities. Holy !#?% they develop so well throughout the story.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I don\u2019t have too much to say about the intro / outro, I feel like it fits the show well. The intro catch onto you quickly and before you know it you\u2019ll stand in the shower humming to it. When it comes to the voice acting all I must say is that it was amazing and it fits the characters so well as they could capture their emotions remarkably well.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Here comes the tough part to decide since the characters\u2019 design was the big reason to why I was rejecting this show in the first place. But I\u2019d say the more I was watching, the more I accepted it and then I started looking at the big picture instead. However, Gon for example could have easily looked so much cooler, instead he kind of resembles a garden gnome in my opinion. You\u2019ll most likely get impressed by the art style sooner or later, just like I did, there were a lot of amazing episodes. *cough* episode 131 *cough*\\n\\n\r\nNegatives: The beginning of Hunter x Hunter felt a bit slow (still good), it could have been a lot better and way more engaging to capture the viewer from the start. Chimera Ant arc was slow from time to time, but it was way far from being bad, could have been better though, but hey nothing is perfect.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: One of the best shows I\u2019ve ever watched. Although I was quick to judge I don\u2019t regret a second that I chose to watch this amazing anime. Incredibly unique, well planned with a fantastic story. Well-made none generic characters, with good voice acting and great character development. Plus plus and plus from my side. Thank you, Madhouse, for this wonderful anime called Hunter x Hunter.\\n\\n\r\nTLDR: For those of you who immediately jumped down here, don\u2019t take this personally but you are a lazy person and with that being said here is the TLDR version.\\n\\n\r\n-Don\u2019t judge the show, if you feel unsure whether if you should watch Hunter x Hunter, just take a few episodes and make your own judgement. It\u2019s not meant for everybody, but at least makes sure if it\u2019s for you before you just leave it.\\n\r\n-Story: Amazing, marathon friendly (even though it\u2019s 148 episodes long).\\n\r\n-Characters: Likeable, none-generic and well developed.\\n\r\n-Art: The big reason why I rejected this anime in the first place was because I thought that the main character Gon looked like Garden Gnome. Yes, I just said it. But believe me you\u2019ll most likely be surprised if you start watching this.\\n\r\n-Sound: Fits well, intro will get stuck in your head and the voice acting fits the characters well.\\n\\n\r\nThat was it for my review, thank you for reading it!\\n\r\n-Ayumey\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "(Simple, to-the-point, anime review for Hunter X Hunter 2011 Subbed)\r\nI feel like the most important aspect of anime is the enjoyment factor. Did I enjoy Hunter X Hunter? YES! My overall rating for this show is 10/10, but that does not mean it doesn't have flaws, because all shows have flaws. The pros of HXH completely overshadow the cons. I highly recommend this show.\r\nSome answers questions about the show to see if it's a show you'd like to watch. \r\nDoes the MC (Gon) make stupid decisions? Yes, but he often makes more good decisions than bad ones. Killua is the character you are looking forif you like consistently smart and fast decision making. \\n\\n\r\nDid this series make me cry or tear up? It did not make me ball my eyes out, but it did make me tear up countless times. \\n\\n\r\nAre the main characters so strong that they never see defeat? Actually, the main characters are EXTREMELY weak and always are weak especially when in comparison to other characters. They often see defeat more than victory. \\n\\n\r\nAre there fillers? In my opinion, no. \\n\\n\r\nAre the villians actually good villians? Yes. HXH has the best, most likable villians I have ever seen in any anime, show, or move. \\n\\n\r\nAre the fights dragged out along many episodes? No. Fights can be from 1 second to 2 episodes tops. The show is more about the progression, interaction, and dialogue than the fights itself. \\n\\n\r\nIs this anime for kids that the first episodes shows? No. I would never recommend this show to a kid. There is murder, death, slight mentions of sex and masturbation, gambling, suicide, cannibalism, blackmail, and so much more. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI have watched all 148 episodes 2 times in a 2 year span, and I still want to rewatch it all over again! There are low points, but there are so many high points. It's not a rollarcoaster ride, because the ride keeps going higher and higher even if there are one or two drops along the way. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters [Hisoka and Killua make this show beyond enjoyable]: Character designs for the MCs and even side characters are pretty normal. Character back stories in general are above average. Voice acting is the best I have ever seen in an anime series. The person who plays Gon deserves many rewards! Gon, Killua, Kurapika, and Leorio are perfect together. Though we do not get to see much of Kurapika and Leorio compared to Gon and Killua, there is a pe factory good explanation why. This show is NOT your average shounen. It is not about \"friendship is power.\" Leorio and Kurapika have their own lives (making them a separate item from the MC). You will see in so many shows where the MC meets new friends along the way and they will stick to the MC like glue until the end of the series. Leorio and Kurapika are friends with Gon, but they are not stupid to throw their lives away by sticking with a 12 y.o kid they just met. \\n\\n\r\nMusic/Soundtrack/Sound/OP/ED [The best part of the show]: OP \"never\" changes. EDs do. The music is above average. I can listen to the whole soundtrack and never get bored. The OST for the third half of the show is where it truly shines. You can feel the emotion in every track. The music for HXH is my FAV part of the show. I believe good music ties a show together. This show with below average music would be a totally different show, BUT the music takes this anime to a whole new level. \\n\\n\r\nStory [Typical Adventure Story]:The story is about a young boy who wants to become a Hunter to find his father who is also a Hunter; that is the reason why he wants to become a Hunter in the first place. 2011 version has no fillers (in comparison to the 1999 version), in my opinion; EVERYTHING is shown for a reason. If something seems not important, trust me, it will be important later. THE SHOW IS NOT ABOUT THE DESTINATION, IT IS ABOUT THE SMALL DETOURS ALONG THE WAY. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation/Art: The animation never dips below a certain point that makes it hard to watch; the animation only gets better especially in the fight scenes. I just wish they didn't censored the show. The censorship is disappointing. I make it sound like there is a lot of censorship; there really isn't, but I'd like none if possible. \\n\r\nDo you want to see people eaten to death by fish? Check. \\n\r\nDo you want to see heads chopped off and necks snapped? Check. \\n\r\nDo you want to see broken body parts and cut off limbs? Check. \\n\r\nDo you want to see a severed heart? Sorry, you won't get to see that here due to censorship... \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10",

            "content": "Hunter x Hunter is a my favourite anime by far so it\u2019s impossible for me to remain unbiased. This won\u2019t be so much of a review as it is a why \u201cI think Hunter x Hunter is one of the greatest best anime and one of the best stories ever told.\u201d Without further ado I shall get right into it.\r\nPlot:\r\nHxH has a fairly straightforward, typical shounen plot. Gon wants to become a hunter and find his dad, so he sets out on an adventure. What is so engaging about the plot is how well paced and fluid it is. Everything feels to flow naturally throughout the plot and in all 148 episodes there isn\u2019t a single dull moment, with scenes that are upbeat and adventurous to scenes brimming with tension and darkness. Hunter x Hunter is a show lulls that you into false comfort and the plot completely shifts or takes an unexpected turn when you least expect it. Believe me when I say you can never know what turn the show is gonna take. HxH also has one of the most natural and gradual tone shifts. At the beginning it was a fun and lighthearted (albeit extremely violent) adventure, and by the time you realise how dark things have gone it\u2019ll be too late. Another thing that\u2019s so good about the HxH plot is that all the arcs change in genre, tone, and length. Each arc takes the shounen formula and shakes up it. From a tournament arc, to a crime drama, and a inside-game-world arc, and all of them are done to the highest standard possible. If you are a fan of shounen anime and you\u2019re looking for a unique experience, then Hunter x Hunter fits the bill.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\r\nHxH has some of the most well written and deep characters in all of fiction. The main character, Gon Freecs, is a deceptively simple, happy go lucky shounen protagonist. However, the interesting thing about Gon is that he\u2019s still just a kid, and that he\u2019s completely naive and immature. This immaturity has an extremely dark side to him, one that is only shown in glimpses until all of Gon\u2019s pain and rage boils up to it\u2019s breaking point, which is quite honestly one of the heart wrenching moments in all of anime, and one of the few times I\u2019ve ever cried from a story. I\u2019m not going to go too in depth into Gon, but the genius of his character is only rivalled (and surpassed) by the writing of other Hunter x Hunter characters. The supporting cast, even some of the most minor characters, have more depth to them than some main protagonists of other stories. There aren\u2019t any characters that are pure evil (even the villains) and no characters that are pure good, they\u2019re all just people that have their own goals and problems, which all collide together.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: \\n\r\nIn all 148 episodes of there isn\u2019t a single drop in animation quality. No corners are cut, no cheap tricks and the show consistently looks beautiful. In fact, strangely enough the quality of animation seems to increase as the anime progresses. It\u2019s almost as if the budget of the show is infinite. When the show looks the best is during its fight scenes, which are surprisingly scarce and yet always so high in quality. Some particular instances when the animation really shines is during the Meruem and Netero fight, the Hisoka and Gon fight, and in general the Chimera Ant arc. Watching the show in 60 fps is especially a fantastic experience, making the animation look even more impressive. The show also varies in colour scheme from arc to arc, with bright, green colours during the greed island and hunter exam arc, and the darker, sharper colours of chimera ant and phantom troupe.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack:\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of Hunter x Hunter is one of the most diverse and best that I have ever had the pleasure of hearing. Pretty much every track was memorable and catchy, with a richness and vibrancy that I rarely ever hear in anime. Like I said before the music is extremely diverse, with some epic, operatic tracks, dark atmospheric tracks, and during emotional songs. All of these are not only effective in the moment, they are also damn good songs to listen to in spare time. The opening is a great fun song, extremely catchy and filled with vigour. The ending songs are really amazing too, with Hunting for your Dream and Hyori Ittai being some of the best songs that have been used in anime ever. I\u2019m not gonna talk about the first ending song, as that song is just bad.\\n\\n\r\nGon and Killua friendship:\\n\r\nOne thing that I couldn\u2019t fit into any of the other paragraphs but felt like I had to include is the friendship dynamic between Gon and Killua. Over many many epsiodes their friendship is developed and it is one of the most heartwarming friendships in all of anime. They emotionally grow and mature, learning from one another and always being crutches for one another. Killua usually takes leadership and is the brains of the two, but without Gon he would be completely lost and doomed to a life of servitude to his family. Killua wants to be the best friend to Gon possible, and feels like he owes him, while Gon just likes being friends with Killua. It's not like fairy tail with \"the power of friendship\", it's a fantastically built up relationship between two young and immature boys, relying on each other and travelling the world together. If you are able to invest in their friendship then oh boy are some emotional moments that are definitely worth a tear (for me too).\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion Hunter x Hunter is one of the greatest stories ever told, and phenomenal in every single aspect. If you haven\u2019t seen this anime, make it a priority to watch it a soon as possible. It is show that truly lives up to it\u2019s status.",

            "content": "I finished Hunter x Hunter in around two weeks, maybe less.  It was so enjoyable on every level that I just kept burning through the episodes.  When describing it to a friend, I compared it to eating candy; highly enjoyable and easy to consume in mass amounts.\r\nThe story was engaging. The main characters were easy to root for (honest, likable, true to their convictions, strong but not invincible). I couldn't wait to see what would happen next. It was action packed, funny when it wanted to be, while still addressing dark themes with serious consequences.\r\nInitially I was hesitant to start it because ofthe large amount of episodes and a cover picture that made it look like it was directed at children.  But with the score being as high as it was, and also since it was completed, I relented and gave it a shot. That was a great decision because it ended up being one of the best/favorite anime I've ever seen. So much so, that I'm scared that it's ruined other shounen anime for me. I've started a few other series since then (D.Gray-man, Fairy Tail) and while I'm sure these series are good, they haven't been able to draw me in the way Hunter did.\\n\\n\r\nI only wish there was more. There were a few side stories and character arcs that were left open ended. I know the manga is still ongoing (aside from some extended hiatuses) so maybe someday we'll get some more. \\n\\n\r\nI loved this anime.",

I've seen these famous shonen like One Piece, Naruto but I've never been interested in watching Hunter x Hunter. I don't know why.\r\nI thought that characters looked uninteresting, in fact it was because Gon, Kirua and  Kurapika looked too young. But yeah it was not very smart because Naruto is young too, i think it was the way the character were made.\r\nBut I finally decided to watch HxH and I got surprised. I mean, i personnaly likedKurapika, it happened that he was not that young and he was really cautious and smart. The innocence and the kindness of Gon marked me, it was special.\\n\\n\r\nThe art of the anime also marked me, it feels like old Naruto or old One Piece and it was also a reason why I loved. It reminds me the time when I started to watch One Piece and I think that it will be one of my favourite anime by far. \\n\\n\r\nLet's put 10/10 !",

            "content": "I'm re-watching this anime for the third time now and it really never loses its charm. Easily my all time favourite anime, and here's why.\r\nStory -- 10 /10\r\nthe one thing the story of this anime does so well is starting off simple without overwhelming us but leaving so much room to develop into something complex, morally conflicting, emotional, and deeply intense. The pacing is great considering the length of the anime. although the smaller infrequent arcs do feel a little slower, they're still entertaining and meaningful nonetheless. This show really doesn't wast any time but also doesn't shove everything at you a once. the comedyfeels more endearing than anything and mostly comes out when the characters' bonds develop. it isn't just there for no reason, they really feel like moments the characters will remember.\\n\r\nfrom the get go the anime feels like one huge adventure. young Gon sets out to become a hunter in his overall goal to find the father that abandoned him at birth. Every arc feels a step closer to that goal, which in itself becomes more and more weighted as we learn more about the characters involved\\n\\n\r\nCharacters -- 10 /10\\n\r\nGon is an excellent protagonist. He often feigns being simple minded but is quick thinking, charming, thoughtful, and actually strong. he also doesn't start out as a loser or someone with no talent like most, which most protagonists do to give room for growth. Yet this anime reminds us that there is so much more to a person than just \"am i strong?\" and \"am i persistnent?\".  he's highly gifted from the start which is usual and refreshing for this genre, but his young age really balances him out. he learns to become maturer and more considerate as the show goes on and he only really gets more loveable. \\n\r\nThe friendship between Gon and the eventual best friend he makes during the Hunter Exam, Killua, feels so real, innocent, and genuine, it really contrasts with how dark the show can be at times but doesn't feel over done and cheesy at all. It's clear how well the two's differences and similarities compliment one another, and the moments they look out for the other feel very real and motivated. Not only that but there's a layer of rivalry between them as they try to develop their skills at the same rate despite Killua's years worth of experience ahead of Gon. The writers keep all of this in mind and you can see these smaller things take relevance and build up.\\n\r\nThese main two characters aside, there are far too many memorable characters to count, and none of them ever feel like just \"the good guy\" or \"the bad guy\". someone who was a villain in the first arc comes back three arcs later aligned with our protagonist, while at some point you'll question to what extent the good guys really are doing the right thing. Characters don't get forgotten in this show, each one counts and many have compelling stories behind them who sometimes feel like the main characters of certain arcs.\\n\\n\r\nart --  9/10\\n\r\ni was incredibly stupid at first in that i put off watching this anime for over a year just because Gon's hair annoyed me at first and made the anime seem childish. WROnG. Msot character designs are memorable and creative, very fitting of each of their personalities at the very least, and they do actually change outfits from time to time which is a much appreciated touch. \\n\r\ni have no complaints on the animation, but like with most it does have room for improvement. However the show really will not let you down when it comes to fight scenes. They're brilliantly and fluidly animated, a really pleasure to witness. \\n\\n\r\nsound -- 9 /10 \\n\r\npersonally i loved the soundtrack, it was really memorable and rarely felt out of place, although i must admit that some of it sounds a little odd and jarring which is my only complaint. Some of the OSTs are really intense and create such a strong sense of atmosphere, and are never misused. The opening song remains throughout the whole show and it becomes a great way to get you fired up for each episode, and quickly you'll find yourself knowing the lyrics for for word. the ending songs weren't my thing though, but they were never bad.\\n\r\nmusic aside, the voice acting is what really makes this show. each actor does a superb job of filling characters with life and personality, no complaints at all. The casting was just spot on.\\n\\n\r\noverall + enjoyment -- 1000 /10\\n\r\ni mean it should be clear a this point how much i enjoyed this show. it'll keep you wanting to watch more and more and is good to watch either over time or to binge away (i've done both..). \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "If it was optional to rate this the highest number in the world, I would. \r\nThis anime is an absolute shonen masterpiece. Never have I been so thrilled and  engrossed in an anime before. The story, the animation, the characters are all so equally unique and diverse. For example, one character wants to avenge his clan, one wants to find his long-lost Father, one of the characters is a psychopathic paedophile who occasionally get's boners yet manages to be one of the best characters in the anime. \r\nSTORY (10/10): The story revolves around Gon Freecs, a passionate 12 year old with the desire offinding his Father and becoming a hunter. Now it may sound like a simple-non complex story, it is. The thing that makes it amazing his how the story is told and how it plays out.  In order to become a hunter, you must go through multiple exams (if you've seen Naruto, it's similar to the chunin exams) whilst striving through the path, Gon meets three other people that he becomes great friends with. Kurapika, Leorio and Killua. When I say the characters are diverse, they really are. Killua is a former-assassin who is the same age as Gon and throughout the anime he really turns into a different character and secretly loves Gon. Kurapika is a blond-haired female-looking character who is my personal favourite character. Honestly, there are certain moments where Kurapika just flips shit and goes bat crazy *cough* Episode 47 *cough*. His clan was massacred by the Phantom Troupe for their eyes, who are also bat shit crazy and are some of the most badass characters ever. Leorio may seem like an asshole but in reality he's the most nicest guy's out there and secretly likes everyone despite him not showing it. Madhouse, the creators of the anime left the anime at the perfect moment and I'm glad they didn't continue the part in the manga otherwise it would just leave it on a cliffhanger.\\n\\n\r\nART (10/10): The animation for this anime is actually beautifully done. To be honest, Hunter x Hunter (2011) is one of the best adaptations of the manga ever. There are various fights throughout the anime that are perfectly animated, most noticeably episodes 126 and 131.  Episode 131 has this black and white animation near the end of the fight with an amazing soundtrack playing in the background and it's just eye-candy.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (10/10): The soundtrack of this anime is beautiful. If you've watched the anime, you know how good it is. 'Hyori Ittai (Lamento for Piano)' is one of the most heart-wrenching pieces of music I've ever listened to, it happens in a very saddening moment in the anime and if you ever listen to it after you've watched the anime, the feels will flood your room, honestly. Other amazing pieces are The Legend of the Martial Artists, The Emperors Time, Kage and Rasetsu, Riot and Kingdom of Predators. These all equally represent pivotal moments in the shows and is just pleasure to your ears.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER (10/10): Okay, as I previously stated the characters in this anime are so diverse and great in their own way. Hisoka (the boner guy) is the biggest creep in the show and in one of the scenes in the anime he gets a massive hard-on for Gon, he's one of the strongest and most badass chraacters in the show and has a bromance with Illumi. Meruem, King of the Ants who looks similar to Cell from DBZ is a powerful smart villain who also develops throughout the anime after meeting Komugi. The game Gungi which Meruem and Komugi plays actually reflects what happens in the story and the meaning behind is very deep. My favourite villains in the shows, the Phantom Troupe are some of the most badass characters ever. There's one quote that the leader says that always gets me...\"Go absolutely crazy\" and they do, the leader stands on a high story building and starts waving his arms like a crazy bastard and does a requiem for a member of the troupe.\"The calendar looses a precious component, the remaining months gather to mourn, the mourners play a melody, while the eleventh moon quietly rises\" - after he says these words, your jaw is going to drop 9 metres.  Feitan, Phinks, Franklin, Machi and Shizuku literally go crazy and literally murder everyone, no one can touch them, even Hisoka (the boner guy) just stands there and finds it hard to comprehend the madness. Kurapika in the Yorknew Arc turns into a complete badass, he gets this chain ability and his eyes turn scarlet when he's angry and when that happens you know you're actually fucked, when his eyes turns scarlet it allows him to turn into a specialist and has 100% efficiency over all aspects of Nen. Also, Nen is one of the most contextualized powers I've personally seen in an anime.  \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT (10/10): I enjoyed this anime through and through and managed to finish it within a week and a bit, that's how engrossed I was in it. It's not all doom and gloom though, there are a lot of funny parts in it (mostly Hisoka) and will make you laugh various times. Another reason why it's so good is that it has no fillers at all.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, if you haven't seen this anime then seriously watch it, you will not regret it at all. \\n\\n\r\nP.S: Togashi if you are reading this, please hurry the fuck up. I'll be dead by the time the Dark Continent arc is finished.",

            "content": "Hunter X Hunter has always been a favorite anime of mine. Ever since it used to air the old series on TV, I used to watch it every day after coming back home from school. I would never have imagined that a series like this could ever need a reboot and that it could actually surpass it. The quality of the anime is way better than the original series, but as far as character designs go, I have to say I  prefer the older version compared to this one.\r\nI actually dropped this a couple of years ago as it was airing and I recentlydecided to pick it up again.\\n\\n\r\nStory - The story is pretty interesting. Sometimes it can be light-hearted and cheerful, and sometimes it can get pretty dark and tragic. Characters die in this anime. Gon wants to become a hunter and finally meet his dad, sounds pretty simple right? Well it isn't really as one has to put his life on the line to become a hunter and even after becoming one. That might sound very interesting, but the most interesting aspect I found in this anime is actually in other characters like Kurapika. The best arc for me was definitely the Phantom Troupe arc, and I feel it was kinda short-lived compared to the long Chimera Ants arc. What bothers me is that despite the anime is over, the story is not. There are a lot more things that have yet to be explored and resolved, which the anime leaves open. Sometimes I felt like there isn't much action going on an a lot of dialogue and narration especially during the Chimera Ants arc. The narration kept going on for a good 4-5 episodes without much happening, but that didn't stop me from enjoying the episodes. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters / Art - Gon isn't a bad main character, but I felt he is over-shadowed by other superior characters, like Kurapika, Hisoka and Killua. My favorite character was definitely Kurapika as I said even his arc stood out more than the other arcs for me. Revenge is always an interesting subject, and even his past intrigues me. I also like how Gon and Killua don't end up being the strongest characters in the series like most other shounen anime after an arc or two. There are actually a lot stronger characters in the series, way beyond their level sometimes. As for the quality of the animation and character desgins, I think the quality is top-notch and very smooth animation, but as character desgins go, I prefer the older version because I think they are more \"mature-looking\" and fits more with the series. It might also be my nostalgia goggles talking here, but that's the way I feel.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - I enjoyed the series, I would recommend it not to just any specific anime fan, but to all anime fans. It's not perfect by far, it might not be everyone's cup of tea, but it's definitely worth a try. I would definitely like to see more of this, but we might have to wait a little while because of the constant hiatus regarding the original creator of Hunter X Hunter. I might try reading the manga where the anime left off sometime in the future.",

            "content": "i will start with the negative ones, because the rest of it is me saying how epic this anime is. PLUS, before you watch this anime, you really need to watch the 1st episode of the original HXH, because it will be needed later on.\r\nNEGATIVES: slow and kinda childish beginning. every arc is above \"good\" but if you compare the 2 best arcs with the 2 worst youll see the difference. even tho it ended in a satisfying way, its still bothersome that we know the manga is ongoing but it will never finish. one scene in the beginning wasnt added, which made some plotholes, so you need to watch the 1st episode of the original series\\n\\n\r\nSTORY  9 / 10 : its impossible to review the story when it completely changes throughout the arcs. so i will review each arc with NO SPOILERS\\n\r\n1st arc  (7/10): slow and childish (at first), good fights, simple plot. main genres/themes: action, adventure\\n\r\n2nd-3rd  (7/10): quite a lot of character development, we get to know more characters, great fights. simple plot/story. main genres/themes: action\\n\r\n4th arc (9/10): its one of the best. theres so much suspense, the fights are amazing, strategy is needed bc \"power\" is irrelevant compared to strategy in this anime. it starts to get dark themed. main genres/themes: action, crime thriller.\\n\r\n5th arc (7/10): this arc was made to develop the main characters' power so that the next arcs can have even more wonderful fights. main genre/theme : action, real life videogame (sao type, but better).\\n\r\n6TH ARC ( 10/10 ) : THE BEST. NOT GONNA SPOIL, BUT GETS DARK AS FUCK. main genres/ themes : war, drama, action, politics\\n\r\n7th arc (7/10): a nice arc to end the journey. main genres/themes: action, politics\\n\\n\r\nART/ANIMATION 10/10 : the art style is simple and kinda cute. but the animation is the best ive seen. the viewpoint constantly changes throughout the fights, the emotions are shown in the best way possible. the art seems light and cheerful at first, but the use dark colours and creepy facial expressions really often\\n\\n\r\nSOUND  10 / 10: the best soundtracks ive even heard in my life, no joking. at first they are happy cute ost's. but the ost's used in the 6th arc are amazing. main instruments are piano and violin. in one episode they used mozarts lacrimosa and one of the soundtracks is inspired by prokofievs dance of knights. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS  10 ++++ / 10 : the best character development ive ever seen. its like FMA and FMAB combined together x 100. the 1st mc (gon) at first is really simple without too many things said about his past, tho after ep. 80 he changes dramatically. all the characters are unique and the majority is amazingly developed, however 3 character in my opinion change dramatically throughout the series, gon killua and meruem.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT  10 ++++++++++++++/ 10 : even tho i mentioned some flaws, they really did not affect me during watching this show, its my favourite anime and i love it to death!!!\\n\\n\r\nVOICE ACTING 10/10: AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i have to say, megumi han started pretty uneven but her performance got developed along with her character. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL : ... youre still reading? shh, go watch it. now. oh youve seen it? go rewatch it . now! 10 / 10",

            "content": "HxH 2011 is truly a top-tier anime. So far, out of any other anime, it is literally the best one I've watched. Period.\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nIt may be tough for newcomers to get interested in HxH starting from episode one, simply because it begins somewhat childish. The anime starts off very \"happy happy\" and takes quite a bit for it to get dark and violent, which is what most anime fans wanna see. If you're patient enough, you'll begin to see things change. From Killua killing people left and right and Gon getting his ass kicked left and right, that's when the story picks up. HxH producesand amazing plot with many shocking twists, leaving it unpredictable and flat-out entertaining. Probably my favorite arc in the entire series is the Phantom Troupe arc. The villains were incredibly lovable and I loved Kurapika's role in the arc. The ending to the arc is insanely mind-blowing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAnother strong point that HxH has is its cast of characters. From primary to secondary, there is literally not a single bland character in the entire series. You can hate a character, but the fact that all of the characters are so well-done, you can't help but like them at least a little bit. The main protagonist, Gon Freecss, is a very unlikely underaged hero, who's powerful, but naiive, hot-tempered, and very simple-minded. His personality is rather realistic, especially for a kid, as he's well-known to have his emotions get the best of him whenever an innocent is harmed. His best friend and probably the most popular character next to Hisoka, is Killua, an undeniably badass and intellectual 14-year-old. His friendship with Gon is incredibly deep. Killua's determination in protecting and controlling Gon shows that he can be somewhat a father figure to Gon. Gon and Killua drive most of the story, but the show would be nothing without the other characters such as Kurapika, Leorio, Hisoka, the Phantom Troupe, and pretty much anyone else in HxH. You'll love every character, or you may even hate them but what's important is whether the characters give you any opinions at all. The diversity of the characters is rather amusing as well. I love how the developers of HxH were creative with different designs, making some characters generic human beings, to making others incredibly imaginative, silly, or even wacky \"beings\".\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nIt won't win any awards, but the animation of HxH is still pleasing to the eye, as all new anime should be anyways. I do enjoy watching the detail the animators put in action sequences, such as the impact of a punch or the exploding aura from a Nen ability, which are all like Hajime no Ippo style.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nAnother aspect of HxH that won't win any prizes, since 90% of the background music is just reused, but I did find some tracks to be rather interesting such as some of the hybrid action music or epic orchestral songs. Some other songs are more One-Piece-type heroic or \"we did it\" music, which really isn't my taste.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI love the hell out of HxH 2011, simply because of its incredibly maintained plot and amazing character development. Screw Naruto, Bleach, DBZ (not showing hate towards fans. I used to watch a bit of DBZ and Naruto myself) or any of that other overpowered shounen crap; you simply cannot call yourself an anime fan without seeing this.",

            "content": "God. Hunter x Hunter 2011. The story is constantly changing. And nearly every arc is amazing (only exception would be the second one in the tournament tower). I believe the best arc to be the Yorknew City arc, but that's a matter of opinion. But the overall story, Gon is looking for his dad and he gets mixed up in all sorts of madness along the way, meeting many great friends as well, including his best friend, Killua who's ACTUALLY the same age as him. The 17-year-old (but acts like he's in his late 20s) Kurapika, and the somehow 19-year-old Leorio. Every character feels realand flushed out. They're consistent and each one gets surprisingly good development despite not all of them having consistent roles. The supporting characters also get a surprising amount of development (one of the advantages of such a large episode count). \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is quite spectacular, though some tiny details can be slightly annoying, but the overall style is ver Mad House. When I first started the show and I saw the first shot of Gon, I actually shouted out \"VASH JUNIOR!\" Though Trigun's art was quite spectacular and they're from the same studio, so similar styles isn't a problem. The animation is very polished and fluid, especially later on. For example, during the final arc, there's a very emotional moment where Killua is crying, the animation of his eyes the moment his eyes well up is absolutely stunningly animated. The fluidity is also outstanding (especially in the Chimera Ant arc and the sixth arc) (The reason I keep saying 'sixth arc' is that the name of the arc is kinda a spoiler). Some of the fight scenes from the later part of the Chimera Ant arc are SO GOOD that you swear your watching something from Mad House with a film budget (which they didn't have for this show). \\n\\n\r\nThe music is pretty good. The actual background music does a good job of setting the tone and filling the silence. The opening song is spectacular. It never changes throughout the entire show, but it is still spectacular and I listen to it on its own constantly. The various endings have different levels of quality. Ed 1: 10/10 Ed 2: 3/10 Ed 3: 9/10 Ed 4: 1/10 Ed 5: 7/10 Ed 6: 8/10. \\n\\n\r\nOverall this show is completely worth all the time it takes to watch it. This show is so much fun and so surprising that it will feel like half of the actual run length. WATCH THIS SPECTACULAR SHOW!",

            "content": "Hunter x Hunter is the longest anime I've watched at 148 episodes. That's about 2.5x the length of my second longest show, Avatar the Last Airbender.\r\nI went for it because it was highly recommended by friends and highly rated. The show has a lot of strengths, but its length and pacing are huge problems that ruined it for me.\r\nCharacters: 9\r\nThroughout the show, the majority of the characters are very well rounded.\r\nThe main characters are very good, but where the show really shines is with the villains. Their motives, their plotting, their interactions with the MCs. Every move they make draws you in. Each of thevillains is fresh and interesting, a big plus for this show.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nThis show usually implements a character-driven plot, and it turns out very well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter driven writing is widely considered the most realistic and entertaining, albeit difficult, method. This means that the situations the characters find themselves in are not put there because they sound cool, but are the natural falling out of the characters' interactions and motives.\\n\\n\r\nSince the show has strong characters, this makes for a series of very good story arcs.\\n\\n\\n\r\nLength: 2\\n\r\nWell, at least the arcs' synopses would sound great, but in reality it's a hyperextended pile of disappointment.\\n\\n\r\nThis is where the Hunter x Hunter's biggest flaw comes into play. The creators seem to have had an episode quota to meet. Rather than tight, action-packed episodes that take you for an immersive ride, you end up slogging through solid episodes of exposition, or realizing that the 20 minute episode you just watched could have been handled in 5 or 10 minutes and been more entertaining. This results in the big impact scenes being too isolated to have the intended impact. You feel excited, or sad, or whatever, but you're left with the impression that it should have been so much more.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, you can't just skip episodes, because each one has some important content and a lot of wasted time. Thinking back over the amount of plot and character that happens in Hunter x Hunter, it's very comparable to Avatar: The Last Airbender. Thus, I think I would have had a much better time with this show if it had been a more appropriate 60 to 70 episodes.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation: 9\\n\r\nThe animation is great, nothing much to say here.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nThe sound was a bit of a weak point in two ways: lack of music variety, and everyone's \"intense\" voice.\\n\\n\r\nI won't hate on the music too much. The songs themselves were great, especially the themes for the different villains. The songs just get old if you binge the show, which I did for part of it.\\n\\n\r\nThe intense voices are a bit worse though. Whenever anyone gets upset they have a super-typical yelling voice that they all do. It gets really old, and they do it in a lot of situations where a normal voice would have been better. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\r\nThere were a lot of good moments, but not enough for 148 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nLooking back, there were a lot of really good moments in this show, which makes me question my low score here. However, the incredible number of \"normal\" episodes where nothing remarkable happens were not very enjoyable. It seems like they thought that the most important ingredient in a  good finale is a 12-episode long fight.\\n\\n\r\n(I set Enjoyment at 3 on the rating scale to take my Length critique into account.)\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\r\nsix is an average score, but this isn't an average show. It is a show that should have been exceptional but decided to drag on forever and kill the excitement. I really loved the good moments in this show. I actually almost cried a couple times. The thing is that I should have been weeping at those scenes but they got the pacing so wrong.\\n\\n\r\nI would not take the time to watch this show again, and I cannot, sadly recommend it for a first time.",

            "content": "Overall I would rate this anime at 9/10.\r\nStory (8/10) - I found the overall story to be really enjoyable. For the most part, the story moved quite well from start to finish, showcasing many great climatic highlights and the odd unexpected twist which really kept you on your toes throughout the series. In my opinion though, I found the ending episodes of the anime to be really lacking and I would have liked to have seen perhaps an alternative ending, but, it is what it is.  \r\nArt (7/10) - The art was good and the character designs were pretty good too. I would stillsay though, that I have seen better artwork and animations compared with this anime. I found the art of Hisoka to be very good and the lighting and shading surrounding this character was at a really high standard compared to the other characters.\\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10) - The soundtrack of this anime was really exceptional! It really draws you in and completes the whole scene. I'd consider the sound of the anime to be the true soul of it all. The character voice acting was really superb also. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10/10) - The character development is what I enjoyed most of all in the duration of this anime series. Gon's development through the anime as the main protagonist was often surprising as you don't expect him (the face of happy-go-lucky) to be overly intense, however, he was clearly a force to be reckoned with at times and really held the series together. My favourite character development would have to be Hisoka as he's one of those character that you really don't know how you should feel about; he shows both moments of being Mr. nice guy but can easily flip to being a true psychopath. It's amazing!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10) -  I found this anime to be extremely enjoyable and would definitely revisit this series in the future. You will not feel let down by this anime and will feel like your a part of the story, growing right alongside the characters. I would most certainly recommend this anime to those who enjoy anime where the main character progresses and become stronger through the series.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading!",

            "content": "I started watching this anime after the encouragement of two of my friends. I took my time and finished it under 2 weeks. That happened a month ago and I developed ideas about anime, the good ones and the bad ones, then decided to write a review about it. Lemme say it right away, it is a good anime. Why not great? It kind of feels like a wavy sea, with ups and downs. HxH is filled with lots of anime clich\u00e9s, like holy sh*t! \r\n\tPS. This is not a spoiler-free review. If you are a fan of the series, it won\u2019t be a problemfor you. Also, if you are a fan and want to hate me, you are welcome to read the review. Because I\u2019ll do an arc-by-arc review and it\u2019ll be quite critical about it.\\n\\n\r\nIt starts introducing the main characters and the setting and defining the word \u201chunter\u201d. My biggest problem with the anime is the first three arcs. You see, when I watch something, I\u2019m willing see something new. I\u2019m dying for it! And with the first arcs nothing new was brought on the table. It\u2019s all about training and competing with people\u2026 then training again. Hear me, the ones who watched know that they are going to train in almost every arc. Why put 30 episodes of training? You could\u2019ve ended it with 10 episodes or something. It\u2019s not like training is something ground-breaking new thing in anime. We\u2019ve seen it in lots of other animes. It\u2019s already a used technique and something that became a clich\u00e9 long time ago. Why return to it? Taking the idea of training and raping our minds with it did not please me much. We want to see something new! Show us something like Hisoka vs Gon duel in Heavens Arena arc. That fight was the turning point for me. I\u2019m not into mindless action but that scene was so intense and well made. However, sadly we don\u2019t get this kind of action really much in HxH. Mostly are slow fights that blended with fighters\u2019 thoughts and plans. Again something that we have seen before. It is an action scene right? So act, don\u2019t talk. I almost gave it up somewhere between episodes 15-20, because it was slow, but\u2026 well my patience paid it off.  First arc 6/10. Second arc 7/10. Third arc\u2026 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\nYes, as you see it got better for me and the fourth arc was the pest part of the whole anime. I realised that those 30 something episodes were a build-up (an alright one) to this. This arc was badass, mysterious overall awesome. Introduction of new characters and the relation of the characters we already knew with them was excellent. Kurapika was awesome. At first Kurapika\u2019s story was kind of bland just like the character itself, but when Kurapika acted, I realised that he was not kidding. His technique was also really interesting. I did not care much about any other character that was doing unrelated things meanwhile Kurapika and her team was clashing with Phantom Troupe. Whatever Gon and Killua did prior the reunion with Kurapika was not that interesting. The arc had a set of awesome characters, lots of new some returned, great story of double-sided revenge, PT song (hack yeah!), good action scenes and twists and turns. I\u2019ll go high, Fourth act 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nGreed Island arc had lots of\u2026 TRAININGS! Nice exactly what I was looking for. It also had a mindless (and intelligent), motiveless villain. The twist about the Greed Island\u2019s existence was quite nice. They could\u2019ve added something to villain\u2019s personality about that twist. But no, we like villains with no motives, right? Gon\u2019s motive was to find his father, Killua\u2019s motive was to help gon. Even the old guy who sent other hunter team into the game had his own motives. Let me give you an example. Digimon season 2, first villain we meet, a kid who loved clashing digital monsters with each other and keeping them in prison cells. A total douche. When he realised that Digital world is not a computer game he went almost mad and redeemed himself becoming a good guy. Yes, Greed Island was actually a real landscape, with real human players. I was expecting a twist in villain\u2019s personality, but no, did not happen. Other than that I did not really have any problems with this arc. Troupe\u2019s return was good, the ball throwing game was good. Lots of good stuff, however villain was a total let-down. 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\nProbably the most talked arc in the whole anime, Chimera Ant Arc. Interesting new characters, great build up, excellent motives to both sides, heroes and villains, and a\u2026 a narrator that almost ruined everything. Nice, we have a superb first and second act with interesting characters like Kite, Knuckles, the pipe dude (he was badass), smoking guy and the other side, King, Pouf, Yupi and that b*tch Pito. Hey look they even added some cool characters like Ikalgo and the chameleon guy. Now that\u2019s a real build up. How\u2019s gonna be our pay off? How? Good? Kind of\u2026 If narrator was not narrating another 20 episodes. If those 20 episodes could\u2019ve ended with 5 episodes instead. It was a lazy decision to add some stupid narrator. I\u2019m not against narrating the story, but explaining things that are clear as a flash light and trying to extend almost finishing story\u2026 nah, not my taste. Characters motives was already flushed out in a build-up part. There were some good action and lots of talks in first two acts. Instead of getting some more action scenes and a few talks, we get totally opposite of it. Lots of talk, less action. I liked the way it ended, mostly because that narrator shut up. That son of a b*tch! It was exactly like chitchatting people in a cinema saloon. Whatever. I get extra angry at these issues, because I am a writer too, and when you do a payoff you gotta do it correctly. I loved how FMAB\u2019s payoff went and I was expecting something similar. Liked the whole arc, despite it had huge problem at the end. 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe last arc. Finally we get to meet the guy we were searching for and he is a F*CKING ASSHOLE! I told you that I\u2019ll be quite critical about the anime. So Gon was searching for his father and we finally meet him. His son is in a f*cked up situation, no one can find the cure. What do you do? Nothing, you don\u2019t even visit him. I remember the voice letter from Gon\u2019s father, about hunters being reckless creatures. But this is not how to be reckless, this is how to be a total f*cking douche. I did not like Gon\u2019s enthusiasm towards his father either. Ed (FMAB) f*cking kicked his father, hated him. But what Gon does? \u201cYaaay I finally met my father!!!\u201d Nope, that\u2019s not how you develop your characters. The other thing that also bugged me was the usage of various characters from previous arcs. They did not have any dialogs, they were just there for the sake of being there. Probably for fan service. Being said that, I loved Leorio\u2019s part (note that I did not like Leorio at first arcs). Killua\u2019s part was damn good too. Overall it was an above average arc. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThere are still some things to be said before conclusion. Never ending stories like this one and like One Piece are not for my stomach. You could say that I despise them. Why? You see the word art is defined as a finished and brief product. You look at them and you pass by in search of something similar. Cowboy Bebop is an art, hell it is a masterpiece. Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is a piece of art too. I don\u2019t and I can\u2019t see this as a piece of art. This anime is not finished (just like its manga) and from what I know it was not going to anytime soon. The only reason why I did not like Berserk anime as much as I liked Samurai Champloo. Go on and hate me, It\u2019s free, but that\u2019s just my honest opinion on this subject. It also affects my overall experience with this anime. I can\u2019t fully like it. Even if the inconsistencies I counted were not there and even if the anime did not have any clich\u00e9s, I would not still go with 10/10. \\n\\n\r\nYeah, about those clich\u00e9s, the best female character in anime was Kite. Yeah, F*CKING KITE. I can\u2019t accept that. I think we needed more Olivier Mira Armstrongs and Riza Hawkeyes (YES! FMAB AGAIN). I\u2019m not a feminist or something, I\u2019m just another writer who f*cking loves well written characters. The anime is full of kawaii bullsh*t young looking girls that are actually 20-40 year old and are plain dumb. However, I liked the girl who transformed into a big masculine woman, despite being cute, because she was not quite one dimensional.\\n\\n\r\nBy far the most interesting character was Hisoka. Why? Have you ever seen a pedophile-like nasty villain who almost sexually enjoyed good fights? I bet your answer is no. Killua was damn good too. He started off too over powered then showed his weak, humanly spots especially for his younger sister.  Now let\u2019s talk about Gon. Or let\u2019s don\u2019t. Again, he was kind of a character that we all have seen in animes tens of times. Extremely enthusiastic, happy, reckless, straightforward guy. \u201cI\u2019m gonna do it!!!\u201d kind of a guy. Not that different from Ash from Pok\u00e9mon, or that main guy from Beyblade. He had his moments, like that final fight with Pito, but overall he was a little bit disappointing for a lead role. They could\u2019ve as well focused story on Killua or even Kurapika. \\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m a weird person but, this anime was really weird. By weird I mean, lots of weird things left being weird and did not get an explanation. How and why Killua\u2019s sister became \u201cKay\u201d guy? How in the world Gon transformed himself to older version of him? However, the biggest how goes to one particular dialog between Gon and Killua. The dialog about Gon\u2019s dates with older women and\u2026 things that those OLDER WOMEN taught to Gon. Killua is like \u201cHe is already a grown man!\u201d\u2026 What? Dude that\u2019s not right. Nope\u2026 nope\u2026 I don\u2019t even want the answer. Let it be unexplained. \\n\\n\r\nHuge plus comes from soundtrack. Don\u2019t really remember exact names of the songs, but almost every single song that played during, before and after episodes were excellent. \\n\\n\r\nDid I like the anime? Yeah I did, it was good and I had a lot of fun time with it. It might be a great anime, but not a masterpiece. HxH is filled with too much clich\u00e9s to be called a masterpiece. HxH\u2019s best parts are SOME of its story arcs, SOME damn good characters, SOME action scenes. The only thing that can be used without \u201csome\u201d were soundtracks. They were awesome. HxH is an unfinished story and a good one even at that. \\n\\n\r\n7.5 out of 10 FMAB (Yes I F*CKING LOVE FMAB)\\n",

            "content": "* * *Spoiler free* * *\r\nI can't deny that I knew I was going to love this show from the get-go. I grew up watching Yuu Yuu Hakusho when Adult Swim was first airing it in the early 2000's, and I used to wish I could be as slick as fourteen year old Yusuke Urameshi. My brother and I would pretend we were the protagonists and he'd beat the absolute shit out of me (as strange as it sounds those were defining childhood memories for me). In addition, it was my first exposure to anime (aside from Pok\u00e9mon, but let's just slide that under therug for now), so naturally I have a soft spot for Togashi's works.\\n\\n\r\nHunter x Hunter is the spiritual successor to YYH, and having watched both, I would certainly say that HxH is a vast improvement in Togashi's authorship. It's not a masterpiece, but it's damn good. If you are choosing between watching the '99 and '11 adaptations... without a doubt, choose this version. The '99 version dropped the ball, but fortunately Madhouse nailed it the second time around. I was brought to tears, I laughed, I felt the immense tension, and I admired the characters. I loved it all.\\n\\n\r\nStory- 8/10\\n\r\nAdventure, action, mystery, suspense, a dash of romance here and there- the whole shebang. As I mentioned before it's not perfect, but it certainly exceeds expectations. The lore and plot are fairly solid. There are few plot holes, (nothing goes unexplained, and the explanations never made me feel like the writers thought I was a retard *cough cough DATTEBOYO*) and everything culminates coherently/satisfyingly in the ending.\\n\\n\r\nI'm aware that the manga is ongoing, but I felt that the final episode was a perfect ending to the adventures of Gon and his unlikely best friend Killua, so I'm fine with the show being put on hiatus. Admittedly, I don't wish for the series to continue because it could lose momentum and lessen the story we've already been given.\\n\\n\r\nArt- 10/10\\n\r\nGorgeous. Just gorgeous. The world of HxH is fleshed out very well and has various haunting, beautiful, and dangerous settings. The animation is unique and flows smoothly. The fights grow increasingly intense as the story progresses, and they are some of the fastest paced/ well choreographed fights I've ever seen in anime. Extremely visually pleasing.\\n\\n\r\nSound- 9/10\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is great. Some of the tracks that are thrown into the mix are absolutely perfect (in particular, a few of the tracks that are used in the tail-end of the series). SFX of the fights and powers all sound superb as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- 10/10\\n\r\nThis category is where Hunter x Hunter shines. The characters and their developments are extremely well thought out and often impressed me. There are so many characters to love and to hate. It's rare that a series can present defining characters AND develop them with careful planning and meaningful conflict. I could go on and on for hours about why I hated or loved the characters that stood out. I'm not one to lose sleep over what happens to characters I don't like/care about, but I found myself immediately invested in many HxH characters; right from the beginning there were quite a few characters that I hoped would/wouldn't die. *Clap clap*\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 9/10\\n\r\nI enjoyed all aspects. I thoroughly enjoyed the story that unfolded between our protagonists Gon and Killua. Some would say that Gon is the \"main character\", but I disagree with that. I believe that the core of this series is about the relationship between the two. Gon, a simple minded yet strong willed child, becomes a hunter to track down his runaway father, meeting Killua at the start of this quest. The prodigal Killua wants to escape the life his father has laid out for him as successor of the 'family business'. So, the two team up and set out on their respective mission, forming an unbreakable bond along the way.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- 10/10\\n\r\nIt's a really well rounded show and I'd absolutely recommend it. If anything, at least add it to your plan to watch list; it's certainly worth a try. The power scaling is decent and the events that unfold seem believable within the bounds of the inexplicable world of Hunter x Hunter. I know that I sound like a raging fan boy but I didn't expect to like this show as much as I did.",

            "content": "\u201cHuman life is too long to devote to reproduction, yet too short to devote to learning in the helix of time\u201d- Ming Jol-Ik, Episode 135.\r\nWhen I watch something what I generally look for is something that can both entertain me and make me care about what\u2019s going on. It usually does this by exceeding in a few certain areas: compelling characters, good pacing, an interesting conflict etc. Rarely does something come along that not only ticks all the basic boxes for being a solid piece of entertainment but manages to rise above that and become something truly breathtaking. This is especially true in the realmsof long running series, either in Japan or over here in the west. They generally conform to certain cliches and ground rules that they are reluctant to step outside, and while they may be highly entertaining and engaging for a few hundred episodes, they seldom offer much in the way of innovation or depth. So what does it take for a series to be everything one desires out of a work of fiction? To be fun, engaging, consistent, balanced, upbeat and entertaining but also deep, thought provoking, intense, genius, powerful and heartbreaking?\\n\\n\r\nWell, it just has to be Hunter x Hunter, that\u2019s what.\\n\\n\r\nHunter x Hunter 2011 is the second adaptation of the classic manga series by Yoshihiro Togashi, which started running in 1998 and has been running ever since(though with many hiatuses). Now, to clear my position I must clarify that I have no great bias against long running shounen series, they are actually pretty fun and often quite engaging. That being said, I also must clarify that this show is in a totally different league to all its competition but that is purely a testament to how absolutely amazing it is and not an attack on other long running shows. Merely by glancing at the score for this show on MAL\u2019s top anime section you can guess that a whole lot of people love this series, in fact most people who have seen it love it. Despite this, I still think that people have not properly expressed why its so good as most of the reviews just tell people how different it is from other long running shounen without expanding on its merits independent of that fact. But that seems like enough rambling for now, lets get down to business!\\n\\n\r\nStory-\\n\\n\r\nHunter x Hunter\u2019s initial premise may be the aspect that puts the most people off because it has a supposedly cheesy shounen vibe to it. Now while I can partially see this it just seems like a silly complaint. Judging a book by its cover is something I vehemently dislike, though elitist anime fans are guilty of it all the time as are closed minded fanboys. So there\u2019s a 12 year old kid called Gon Freecs who wants to find his father by taking an exam to become a hunter. This sounds kind of typical of an adventure show. However, the moment Gon sets foot into the hunter exam, we see the kind of world he lives in, and trust me its not a very pleasant one. The exam is gruelling, candidates try to trick others and even sabotage their chances of passing, murderers are allowed to participate and all kinds of other unpleasantries. Now instead of getting some OP power up or plowing through exam with the power of friendship Gon struggles through affair with perseverance, determination and just plain luck. This is very reflective of HxH as a whole. The main characters set themselves very simple goals but often end up being totally outclassed, being bit players in bigger schemes or having to settle for much less than perfect victory. The way it is written allows our protagonists to participate in an engaging scenario and have to deal with that scenario and grow as characters without them being the central players in all the conflict. \\n\\n\r\nThe series\u2019 fighting system, Nen, is a very complicated one but is balanced enough to provide the viewer with interesting fights and strategies without seeming like a convoluted mess of a power system. It also serves to balance our protagonists with some of the more powerful enemies in the series and provide methods in which they can have an advantage over their enemies by virtue of their creative use of their powers. Another great thing is how aside from strategy, the most important thing about fights in this series is experience. Hunters in the series don\u2019t just suddenly become powerful, they have to spend years honing their skills on various missions and jobs that give them the experience and knowledge they need to be formidable combatants. \\n\\n\r\nThe best way to describe the ins and outs of the plot would be to discuss the structure which, like many long running shounen, is divided into arcs. There are 6 arcs in the whole show(if you discount the 4 episode Zoldyck family mini arc which I don\u2019t see as a full arc, just an extension of the first one). All of these arcs focus on our main characters reaching a goal they have set themselves while revealing more and more about Hunter x Hunter\u2019s fascinating world. They all vary in tone, length and style but all still feel like different parts of the same journey. Each one is written with extreme detail and care, paying close attention to structuring the individual arc\u2019s story in such a way that it feels complete by the end but there is always still room for the journey to continue. They also all conjure up different moods and themes. The hunter exam arc is an engaging underdog story that introduces the diverse cast of characters, the Phantom troupe arc is a dark, urban thriller that focuses on the thematic idea of a cycle of revenge and the chimera ant arc is a very long, dense war arc that brilliantly explores the ideas of evolution, human nature and morality. \\n\\n\r\nThe sense of pacing in each arc is excellent and the writing is flexible enough to change the pacing depending on the scenario. For example, during the palace invasion section of the chimera ant arc the pacing slows down to immensely slow speed in order to capture the brutal intensity of the situation and the sheer amount of things happening at once. These changes in pace irk many viewers though to me I can\u2019t see how the series would work without them as they are necessary for squeezing the full dramatic impact out of every moment. The tension in every arc is also unparalleled in its intensity. A combination of the pacing, the characterization and the scenarios make some moments in this series almost heart stopping in how tense they are. This combined with the very clever dialogue and battle strategies that HxH employs mean that its a very polar opposite watching experience than most shounen in that you really have to be paying attention to soak up the full effect of everything. A thing I see a lot of people complaining about is the lack of a big climax in every arc. In many shounen series there would be a big epic battle to end each arc where all the villains die and all the heroes nearly die. HxH arcs don\u2019t have this no but they do have emotional and thematic payoffs that to me anyway feel just as satisfying as  as a big battle would. \\n\\n\r\nMy favorite and what I consider to be the best arc would definitely have to be the chimera ant arc. Its based around the idea of another species evolving to a point where their intelligence and numbers rival that of humans and a long and bloody war breaks out between them and the human race, led by the hunter association. This arc is where the previously mentioned tension is used to full effect and all the intelligence of the writing is used to construct a truly breathtaking 60 episode experience, its one of those stories that can\u2019t really be explained and just has to be experienced. \\n\\n\r\nNow to talk about about weaknesses. While there certainly aren\u2019t many major weaknesses, for the sake of being a fair critic I do have to mention them. Of all the arcs, the Greed Island arc would have to be labelled as the weak point of the series. Now, don\u2019t get me wrong, the arc is still solidly written and entertaining enough but I feel it has a fair share of problems. Firstly it takes place inside a virtual reality game and it feels like a bit of a tonal shift from the rest of the series. It distracts from the very interesting world of HxH to kind of do its own thing for 20 episodes. I also think the villain in this arc is pretty weak and cliche which is surprising as this show generally has really brilliant villains. I just feel that the arc feels less like it takes place inside the gritty world of HxH, full of assassins and thieves and more like its from a different show.\\n\\n\r\n Other weaknesses are minor ones such as a few minor plot holes here and there and some questionable character decisions but considering the ambition of the show, this is somewhat to be expected. Other people point out pacing issues, an inconsistent first few episodes and other perceived problems but I honestly can\u2019t see these let alone think they are major issues. Overall, the weaknesses, of which there are few, do little to harm the impact of the series in any meaningful way and doesn\u2019t stop HxH stand out for having one of the most complex, unique, varied and engaging stories in all of shounen.\\n\\n\r\nScore- 9.2/10 Very solid arcs, great tension, brilliant pacing, genius writing and full of intriguing ideas\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters-\\n\\n\r\nYou thought the story was the best thing about this show? Well think again because the characterization may be even better. Firstly I should mention that this show has an absolutely humongous cast. There must be at least 200 named characters by the end of the show and most of them serve some kind of purpose within the narrative. For this section though I am just going to discuss the main characters, the villains and some of the other standouts. \\n\\n\r\nGon Freecs is our hero and from the offset he may seem like a rather typical shounen protagonist. He\u2019s upbeat, determined and stubborn. However, over time we learn that Gon is not a simple individual nor is he driven by any typical goals. He searches for the lifestyle of a hunter to see why his father decided to become a hunter and hopefully one day to meet him. But, Gon is an underdog throughout most of the story and many of his traits end up causing him to lose more than he wins. His determination and stubborn nature cause him to suffer great physical and mental damage over the course of the series. His determination and naive nature lead him to have a lack of critical thinking ability and a warped sense of morality. Despite this, we understand Gon\u2019s emotions and drive enough to want him to overcome the obstacles in his way and we don\u2019t connect with him just because he\u2019s the good guy but because he is a very understandable character.\\n\\n\r\nKillua Zoldyck is Gon\u2019s polar opposite in many ways but also shares some traits with him. Cold and logical, Killua was raised to be a professional assassin but abandoned his family and that destiny to take the hunter exam. He hides his trouble childhood and family problems behind the facade of a normal kid. His friendship with Gon is one of his main reasons for not wanting to go back to his life as an assassin and the relationship dynamic between the two continuously evolves in each arc. \\n\\n\r\nKurapika is a revenge driven exam candidate who Gon meets on the way. Also cold and calculating like Killua he has dedicated his life to finding the thieves who killed his tribe and harvested their scarlet eyes(Still think this is a kids show?). He claims he doesn\u2019t need friends as they only distract him from his goal of vengeance which he is aware will lead him to dark places. His character may seem to be simple and closed minded but his motives and choices become increasingly complex as events play out especially during the Phantom troupe arc where he becomes the main character for 20 or so episodes.\\n\\n\r\nLeorio is the oldest of the main characters and is taking the exam so he can train to be a doctor in order to help his poverty stricken hometown. He may appear to be the token comic relief character but he has a lot of depth to him and proves to be a useful ally to the other main characters even though he is not particularly useful in battle. \\n\\n\r\nThese main characters all have great dialogue and chemistry with each other and the interactions between them form the initial charm of the series. However the show would not be half as interesting if it weren\u2019t for the villains. The villains are equally as interesting if not more so than the protagonists. For example the morally ambiguous psychopathic clown Hisoka casts a great sense of threat in the early episodes but his motivations are arguably more sinister and bizarre than they initially appear. Then there\u2019s the Phantom troupe who, even though they are ruthless thieves, have a definite sense of camaraderie and enough personality to help you see them in a different light than just being bloodthirsty killers. Even the non-human villains have a lot of depth to them. I am of course referring to the chimera ants, whose characterization both as a species and as individuals is absolutely fascinating. The standouts among the ants include the ant king Meruem whose journey throughout the arc is equal parts emotionally shattering, thought provoking and unforgettable, his royal guards Shaiapouf and Neferpitou who receive a lot of visible depth and development and also some of the other normal ants like Welfin, Ikalgo and Colt. \\n\\n\r\nEven the background characters and characters who only show up for a brief role in the story can leave quite an impact, that\u2019s how great this show is at packing personality and detail into every aspect of its narrative. No, not every character is given focus(that would be impossible!) but the show is pretty impressive with how it measures everything out carefully to provide you with enough information to be satisfied while still keeping you wanting to come back for more. \\n\\n\r\nScore- 9.5/10 A whole lot of them but somehow it manages!\\n\\n\r\nArt-\\n\\n\r\nHunter x Hunter was animated by Madhouse who are revered for many high quality TV anime productions over the years such as Death Note, Black lagoon and Monster. They are generally known for their high quality animation and this show is definitely no exception. To keep up a show looking this good for 148 episodes is just staggering. The art style itself is initially quite colourful which is probably another reason why people dismiss this anime as a kids show. Though as you make your way through the series you realize that the art style is actually very flexible. Its incredibly detailed and crisp use of colour and texture is able to create a variety of different environments and atmospheres. From the lush paradise of Gon\u2019s home of whale island to the urban fuzz of Yorknew city everywhere in the show feels distinct and detailed which adds to the overall tone of each arc. The same can be said for the character designs. The great thing about them is that they are all unique just like all the characters themselves and no two designs look the same. While the designs themselves are wildly creative they have been criticized by some for being a little too bizarre and at times cheesy. This I can agree with but I don\u2019t see exactly what the problem is here, its a lot better than having a cast of indistinguishable muscular psychos who beat each other up for episode after episode. HxH\u2019s designs may be rather quirky but the show still manages to come across as much more mature than many shows with more realistic designs. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is pretty solid for the most part though at times it is clear that Madhouse are on a budget of some sort as there are occasionally skimps and still frames in some of the fights so this is a thing that occurs a lot in shounen due to what I assume is an absurd amount of money required to keep animation quality consistent for hundreds of episodes. Though when the fights look good they REALLY look good. The intensity and breakneck speed of the fights is captured perfectly and adds to the already sky high tension of these scenarios. This is a pretty solid effort for such an ambitious series animation wise and a few hiccups here and there can certainly be forgiven. \\n\\n\r\nScore- 8.8/10 Beautiful landscapes, mostly great animation and unique character designs \\n\\n\r\nSound-\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the OST goes its wide and incredibly varied. There are many tracks, some that play throughout and some that are restricted to specific arcs. Most of the music is orchestral but it incorporates other genres and elements too such as electronic beats, distorted guitars and piano ballads. The soundtrack also evolves to match the tone each arc and each scenario. Early in the series songs like \u2018The world of adventures\u2019 with its circus like mood signify the initial adventurous tone of HxH. Later on in the Phantom troupe arc we get more dramatic and operatic pieces like \u2018Riot\u2019 which reflect the chaos of the events happening in that arc. Then there are specific character themes like Hisoka\u2019s flamenco influenced character theme which sums up his insanity and unpredictability so well and the Zoldyck family theme which sounds fittingly foreboding for such a dysfunctional family. But, by far the best of the music comes from the chimera ant arc where it really helps to add to the tension and mood of everything that happens. The haunting and frantic violin piece \u2018In the palace\u2019 forms a great backdrop for a lot of the tension in this arc. Then there\u2019s the battle theme \u2018Hegemony of the food chain\u2019 which starts reservedly before erupting into a storm of distorted guitars that adds to the frantic nature of a lot of the fights that occur in the arc. Finally you have the heart crushingly beautiful \u2018Understanding\u2019 and \u2018Elegy of the dynast\u2019 which greatly enhance some of the most solemn moments in this arc. I\u2019m not going to lie, i\u2019ve spent many a time since I finished this series curled up in my chair listening to these pieces reflecting on the brilliance of this arc. This is a massive soundtrack. Its fitting, impactful, beautifully composed and greatly complementary to the HxH experience.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as OP and ED\u2019s go, there\u2019s not a whole lot to say. Throughout the series it maintains 1 opening and i\u2019m not going to lie, this probably wasn\u2019t the best idea. Don\u2019t get me wrong the song itself \u2018Departure\u2019 is infectiously catchy and good to introduce the series but with how dark everything gets as it goes on it feels a little redundant and unfitting. Thankfully the 6 ED\u2019s are much more varied. They match the tone of their respective arcs and parts of the show very well. My favorites would have to be \u2018Hunting for your dream\u2019, an upbeat power metal song which got me so pumped to watch the next episode during the Phantom troupe arc and \u2018Hyori ittai\u2019, a more solemn acoustic song that always made me reflect on the episode I had just watched during the latter stages of the chimera ant arc where it played.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to voice acting I have to give a fair amount of credit to the seiyuu for doing a pretty damn good job with such a large and varied cast. The voices fit the characters and are more than competent at pulling off all the comedic, dramatic and emotional scenes when the show needs them to. Megumi Han and Mariya Ise play the parts of Gon and Killua very well, sounding very convincingly like 12 year old boys and perfectly capturing the personalities of each character with extraordinary flair. If I had to choose other standouts I would go with Daisuke Namikawa as Hisoka who sounds so delightfully insane its legitimately frightening at times. Next would be Miyuki Sawashiro as Kurapika who sounds convincingly like a person severely haunted by their past but strong enough to endure it. Finally my last standout would be Koki Uchiyama as the chimera ant king Meruem who really gives life to the king\u2019s journey throughout the arc though saying anymore would be spoiling. \\n\\n\r\nScore- 9.4/10 Beautiful OST, great voice acting, could have done with more openings\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-\\n\\n\r\nDo I really have to tell you that HxH is an enjoyable show? Well it damn well is, one of the most enjoyable i\u2019ve ever watched. Though i\u2019ve been mentioning all the little details and nitty gritties that make HxH completely genius these are all things I picked up after contemplation, the show itself gives you almost no time to think about those things! Every episode, every moment, every event is utterly thrilling or engaging in a different way. Even episodes that are mostly talking or contemplating are still highly entertaining due to the wealth of things each character and the show itself has to say. You will marathon this show, it is inevitable, you just won\u2019t be able to stop yourself. But, at the same time, you\u2019ll also be tempted to take systematic breaks to prevent your heart stopping and to savour the experience of watching such a fantastic show. The tension is, as I previously mentioned, unparalleled and that is a great factor to the enjoyment. Also, the series has an absolutely brilliant handle on cliffhangers that almost unfairly tease you into clicking the next episode button. So yes, this is an entertaining show, from beginning to end it never feels like a slog despite its length and in fact will probably leave you wanting more.\\n\\n\r\nScore- 9.6/10 Tension through the roof, cliffhangers everywhere, not a slog in any way \\n\\n\r\nConclusion- What else am I to say? This is without a doubt a show of the highest caliber, it deserves to stand up there with FMA as one of the greatest adventures anime has to offer. If there was more of this show, i wouldn\u2019t hesitate to get on it. I know the writer takes many hiatuses but can you blame him? Do you really expect him to write stuff this good consistently? This is one of the greatest anime, scratch that, one of the greatest TV series I have ever watched to completion. I\u2019m sorry for being redundant, I know everyone and their mother loves this series and has articulated how much they adore it on this very site. My cries of love for it may very well be drowned in the veritable cascade of fans that have taken the same emotions to the slate but I tell you, there is no anime more worthy of that treatment than this one.\\n\\n\r\nFinal scores\\n\\n\r\nONS(Overall narrative score, Story+Characters+Enjoyment/2)=9.4/10\\n\r\nOAS(Overall aesthetic score, Art+Sound/2)=9.1/10\\n\r\nOFS(Overall final score, average of all categories)= 9.3/10\\n",

            "content": "In a world with magic, steampunk, and select modern technology, twelve-year-old Gon and his friends are determined to achieve various goals by becoming Hunters, for which they need to pass the fiendishly difficult and incredibly dangerous Hunter Exam.\r\nThis series is compulsively watchable and addicting, even at its length of 148 episodes, and it\u2019s all in the characters: the idealistic but practical Gon, the wryly playful Killua, the scholarly and thoughtful Kurapika, and the impetuous Leorio. Side characters are given similar consideration and depth, like Hisoka the creepy \u201cJoker\u201d character and a ton of other \u201cenemy\u201d characters (like the Phantom Troupe, other Hunters, and even theChimera Ants). Just finding out about characters\u2019 specialized fighting abilities (through a power called \u201cNen\u201d) is totally fascinating.\\n\\n\r\nAt first, you think this is a really happy series, full of fun and silly things where fights are easily won without any sacrifice on the protagonist\u2019s part. And then little by little, some really seriously dark material starts to creep in, and you see how messed up this anime can get, with torture, murder, hypnotism, child abuse, insanity, imprisonment, genocide, and gladiatorial fights to the death. The art lulls you into a false sense of security that hides the dark themes to come.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the dark events are a double-edge sword for this anime, and my main complaint is that the anime does not treat the often devastating collateral damage to civilians or bystanders with as much gravitas and angst as it treats damage to the heroes and their loved ones. I never thought I\u2019d be requesting characters to feel more overwhelming angst or guilt in my entertainment, but parts of this anime feel so strangely unreal without it. As I said before, the anime is chock-full of random acts of shocking violence, but they are only occasionally treated as such by any of the main characters.\\n\\n\r\nMinor unnamed characters are constantly dying or being tortured in horrific ways. In one scene, an extra suddenly and without warning becomes a double-amputee for a minor infraction (he bumped against someone without apologizing), and not only is he never seen from again, none of the other characters present do anything more than basically shrug blithely and go back to their conversation. I found myself wondering, \u201cDid that just happen?!\u201d\\n\\n\r\nI would compare this anime\u2019s world-building to Fullmetal Alchemist, but I find it impossible to imagine FMA\u2019s characters dealing with something like that in such a bland way\u2014if Ed Elric saw an event like that, he\u2019d be shocked to the core and angsting about it for months! So while Hunter x Hunter has the potential to really explore the depths of the human psyche, it too often squanders great opportunities in favor of simply moving the plot along.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, even with the darkness, the anime does have plenty of heart, with its main theme being the power of friendship and determination. Beware: the first few episodes are not great, so definitely give this one time to get going. Because it will. By the end of the last arc, I was stunned at the incredible journey I had just taken with these characters.",

            "content": "Best Combination. Gon and Killua.\r\nHunterxHunter is one of the greatest anime series I have watched if not the best. The story is very compelling in a way that almost all of the events happening during the anime are unexpected. It also gives relation to the status quo of the world. Like the isolation of North Korea to the whole world, and different reactions of people towards domination, torture, and culture. You will understand what I'm saying when you watch it. Matching it with a good way of storytelling, the story is told properly and very understandable. It leaves me craving for more of the excitementand surprises that I experienced upon watching the anime. I certainly hope that the anime would continue as soon as possible. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of HunterxHunter is outstanding. If you've watched the first HunterxHunter series(1999), its opening soundtrack is as great as this one. A very memorable and catchy opening song and appropriate for the mood of the anime. I even listened to all of the ending soundtracks, which i usually do not do, because it really matches with what is happening on the anime.\\n\\n\r\nWhat i really appreciate from this series is that they've given new ambiance to the parts that were covered by the first series. Although it lacks the emotions portrayed by the first series, it gave new mood to those first parts of the anime so I still watched it even though I've already watched the first series. When the anime gets to the part of the ants, it proves itself that is can be considered as one of masterpieces of animes.\\n\\n\r\nEach character are well introduced and are all unique. The development of characters throughout the story is very visible and very convincing. I also really liked how they conveyed the different dilemmas encountered by each of the major characters. Especially on the part of Killua. Even information for minor characters are well detailed.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, HunterxHunter is very unique and enjoyable experience. Especially if you have watched the first series(the 1999 series). A very good anime that deserves to be on one of the best. Take time in watching this anime. I learned many things because of this anime.",

            "content": "English Version\r\nI will talk only about the errors of the series .. Arc by Arc\r\n1)Hunter Exam.\r\nAlthough the beginning paints well and forms the friendship relations of which the main cast will be everything that consists of the examination itself is badly planned, to start all the characters do not seem to have empathic emotions with respect to everything that is happening in the same exam, nobody is unfazed or feels some fear corresponding to death, if I compare it with the whole cast that was raised and the situations in the Chunnin exam in Naruto this part HxH is too short, I could also talkabout the end of the exam the hunter is hypocritical in the sense that they had raised this idea \"No matter what happens we will continue with the exam until the end\" but when they reach the tournament part in the end they complement it with \"You can not kill the opponent\" here everything goes relatively \"Good\" but when Killua kills the opponent they send everything to take for ass and approve the others in such a simple way, all the effort of the people who died to love complete the exam they sent him to take for ass for that detail.\\n\\n\r\n2) Tower of Heaven\\n\r\nA whole arc where Killua and Gon go in search of skills, their premise is their problem, because it is basically that, a focused arc only to start making \"Complex\" the fights and make the show \"Deep\", the arc entirely dense, not passable or entertaining, simply dense and tedious, the fights of that arc are worth nothing because Gon and Killua are entirely protected by the plot armor of the moment so you know that they will not lose or die, therefore there is NO RISK, that means \"boring\". The arc is entirely bad\\n\\n\r\n3)York City\\n\r\nDecerebrate action with a protagonist Gary stu to summarize things ... Kurapika skips the rules of the Nen that were established a back arc, you can increase the powers as he wants, He has unlimited access to the whole bar of powers of Nen, does not have any reflection after killing Uvogin because he had previously established that from his point of view everything he does is correct, Togashi fills Kurapika with unlimited weapons and powers after taking all one to create such a complex system of powers ... Shit\\n\\n\r\n4) Greed Island\\n\r\nThe tower of heaven made worse; This arc is basically canon filler, you can skip it and it will not change anything, just take care to know that \"Gon and Killua train their powers in a world of video games\" because from then on the villain is the worst of the series in general , the bomber is forced into this arc only to create \"drama and tension\" .. All this arc is the worst shit\\n\\n\r\n5) Quimera ants\\n\r\nVery good the arc entirely, the whole series was prepared for this moment and it is excellent, it has its criticable things as the Asspull of the nuclear bomb of Netero or that eliminated all the development of Meruem giving it \"Amnesia\" only to lengthen the arc still more in a more insufferable way ..\\n\\n\r\n6)The elections\\n\r\nThe arc totally shits the consequences of the chimera ants (Revive Gon), the idea of \u200b\u200bAlukka was not so bad since it had rules but AGAIN togashi loves to fuck his own rules and makes Killua know the only way to get the wishes WITHOUT CONSEQUENCES ... To end the arc with Gon looking for his father in the world tree, Gin tells him the message of the work in general \"That what matters is the trip, not the final destination\" the message would have meaning if Gon had learned something in his trip through the whole series, but you know what? GON NEVER LEARNS ANYTHING, IS THE SAME START TO THE END ... With this proposed you can imply that everything that happened the series is a nonsense that even in its last moments can unite its history with coherence to the message of the work\\n\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion..\\n\r\nThe work is anticlimactic, it breaks all its proposed ideas, the protagonist never learns anything, the work is worth only in a single arch of 6 principals, the direction and the music make the series mediocre even if the script entirely becomes bad ..\\n\\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nVersion en Espa\u00f1ol\\n\\n\r\nHablare \u00fanicamente de los errores de la serie.. Arco por arco\\n\\n\r\n1) Arco del examen del cazador.\\n\r\nSi bien el inicio pinta bien y se forman las relaciones de amistad del que ser\u00e1 el cast principal todo lo que consiste al examen mismo est\u00e1 mal planteado, para empezar todos los personajes ni parecen tener emociones emp\u00e1ticas con respecto a todo lo que est\u00e1 pasando en el mismo examen, nadie se inmuta o siente alg\u00fan miedo correspondiente a la muerte, si lo comparo con el cast entero que se plante\u00f3 y las situaciones en el examen Chunnin en Naruto se queda muy corto esta parte HxH, tambien podr\u00eda hablar que el final del examen del cazador es hip\u00f3crita en el sentido de que ellos hab\u00edan planteado esta idea \u201cNo importa lo que pase seguiremos con el examen hasta el final\u201d pero cuando llegan a la parte del torneo en el final lo complementan con \u201cNo se puede matar al oponente\u201d aqu\u00ed va todo relativamente \u201cBien\u201d pero cuando Killua mata al oponente mandan todo a tomar por culo y aprueban a los dem\u00e1s de forma tan sencilla, todo el esfuerzo de la gente que muri\u00f3 para querer a completar el examen lo mandaron a tomar por culo por ese detalle.\\n\\n\r\n2) Torre del Cielo\\n\r\nTodo un arco donde Killua y Gon van en busca de conseguir habilidades, su premisa es su problema, porque es b\u00e1sicamente eso, un arco \u00fanicamente enfocado solo para empezar hacer \u201cComplejas\u201d las peleas y hacer que el show sea \u201cProfundo\u201d, el arco enteramente es denso, no es pasable ni entretenido, simplemente denso y tedioso, las peleas de ese arco no valen nada la pena por que Gon y Killua est\u00e1n enteramente protegidos por el plot armor del momento asi que sabes que ni van a perder o morir, por lo tanto NO HAY RIESGO, eso significa que \u201cAburrido\u201d. El arco enteramente es malo\\n\\n\r\n3) York City\\n\r\nAccion descerebrada con un protagonista Gary stu para resumir las cosas\u2026 Kurapika se salta las reglas del Nen que se establecieron un arco atr\u00e1s, se puede aumentar los poderes como \u00e9l quiera, Tiene acceso ilimitado a toda la barra de poderes de Nen, no tiene alguna reflexi\u00f3n luego de matar a Uvogin porque desde antes se hab\u00eda establecido que desde su punto de vista todo lo que hace es correcto, Togashi llena a Kurapika de armas y poderes ilimitados luego de tardar todo un para crear un sistema tan complejo de poderes... Mierda\\n\\n\r\n4) Greed Island\\n\r\nLa torre del cielo hecho peor; Este arco es b\u00e1sicamente relleno canon, te lo puedes saltar y no va a cambiar nada, solo ocupas saber que \u201cGon y Killua entrenan sus poderes en un mundo de videojuegos\u201d porque de ah\u00ed en mas el villano es lo peor de la serie en general, el bombardero esta metido forzadamente en este arco solo para crear \u201cdrama y tension\u201d.. Todo este arco es mierda de la peor\\n\\n\r\n5) Hormigas Quimera\\n\r\nMuy bueno el arco enteramente, toda la serie se preparo para este momento y quedo excelente,  tiene sus cosas criticable como el Asspull de la bomba nuclear de Netero o de que eliminaron todo el desarrollo de Meruem d\u00e1ndole \u201cAmnesia\u201d solo para alargar el arco aun mas de forma mas insufrible.. \\n\\n\r\n6) Las elecciones\\n\r\nEl arco caga totalmente las consecuencias de las hormigas quimera (Revivir a Gon), la idea de Alukka no estaba tan mal ya que tenia reglas pero OTRA VEZ togashi le encanta mandar a la mierda sus propias reglas y hace que Killua conozca la \u00fanica forma de conseguir los deseos SIN CONSECUENCIAS... Para finalizar el arco con Gon buscando a su padre en el \u00e1rbol mundial, Gin le comenta el mensaje de la obra en general \u201cQue lo que importa es el viaje, no el destino final\u201d el mensaje tendr\u00eda sentido si Gon hubiera aprendido algo en su viaje por toda la serie \u00bfPero saben que? GON NUNCA APRENDE NADA, ES EL MISMO DE INICIO HASTA EL FINAL\u2026Con esto propuesto puedes dar a entender que todo lo que paso la serie es un sin sentido que ni siquiera en sus \u00faltimos momentos puede unir su historia con coherencia para el mensaje de la obra\\n\\n\r\nEn conclusi\u00f3n..\\n\r\nLa obra es anticlim\u00e1tica, rompe todas sus ideas propuestas, el protagonista jamas aprende nada, la obra solo vale la pena en un \u00fanico arco de 6 principales, la direcci\u00f3n y la m\u00fasica hacen a la serie mediocre aun cuando el guion enteramente llega a ser mala..\\n",

That's why let's say that I gave it 10.9999.../10.\r\nOkay, I'll try to keep this as much as I can abstract and spoiler-free. Story in HxH is very unpredictable and extraordinary. It's kind of like Game of Thrones, nobody issafe. It means that even if you have been training all your entire life and other people consider your being one of the strongest, there might be chance that somewhere, sometime, someone is born with talents that already surpass your abilities. Or you may be super-strong and break stones with your head, but somebody can outsmart you and, for example, blow you to pieces. That means that there's no such state as being 100% invulnerable one-punch man, you can only struggle for life in this world. And that looks damn fair, doesn't it?\\n\\n\r\nAnd what's the story about? Well, I could say that it's about love and hate. And crime and punishment. Also loyalty and betrayal. Life and death. Religion and human spirit. Cruelty and forgiveness. Happiness and sorrow. Recklessness and forethought. Humanity and nature. Parents love. And all these things are not hidden behind some obscurity and understatements. It's literally being thrown at you face, you just have to listen. All the emotions are in their extreme forms, not at some half-assed extent. Remember that feeling from Attack on Titan that titans give: the fear of something unbeatable and inevitable. And this show gives it in much, much greater extent. If you haven't seen this show, all this paragraph may look non-sense to you, but after watching I believe you can find examples of all my words.\\n\\n\r\nArt is great, it looks and feels new and polished, but with original characters designs that may look childish. Don't be fooled but that, that doesn't affect storytelling in any way.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack in HxH is simply outstanding. OPs and EDs are catchy songs, while BGM is mostly classical orchestra of very high quality. Oh, and there's Mozart. If he's not good enough then I don't know.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and there's character development. Yes, really. I won't say anything more, because, you know, spoilers. Avoid spoilers about this show at any cost. Don't even read reviews, close this tab and don't return until you've seen it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the show is easy to watch and good for marathon. Starting as happy adventure, it evolves into intellectual and tense drama. Even considering not-finished state of manga, anime finale left me satisfied and the show feels complete. Made with love and care, it's really one the best shows ever.\\n\\n\r\nP.S. I wanted to have some good quote as an epigraph, but was afraid of giving a spoiler. And, after having some thought, I remembered this song that can make some associations for those who have seen the series, but doesn't say anything to others. That's it.",

I jumped into the show with really high expectations and was expecting a decent anime with too much over-hype.  BOY WAS I WRONG!\r\nWhen you first start watching this show, it will seem sort of childish, or your typical Shounen animu.  However, you will begin to receive little hints throughout the series that there is more than what meets the eye.  This is definitely NOT a children's show.  Thereare many subtle twists that nudge you along the way and then suddenly when you begin the Chimera Ant Arc from episodes 76-136, the show starts turning all of those twists and nudges into jabs and the show hits you like a Mack truck.\\n\\n\r\nI am not saying that the show is not good until episodes 76-136, I'm just saying that that is the arc that no one can shut up about.  The entire series is beautiful and is very very well paced with only 2 episodes of filler.  The SUB voice acting is stunning and the art style stays consistent and is gorgeous throughout.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would not only recommend this anime, but I would go so far to say that it is a show that everyone should watch at least once before they die.",

            "content": "Why you should watch HxH? What things made me love this anime? Why is so great?...\r\nHunter x Hunter 2011 is not flawless, it has boring moments, \"meh\" episodes and arcs. The animation is not surprisingly outstanding all the way trough, and (in more than one occasion) you just want some of the characters to die due to how annoying they are. So... why?  Why is so good even after all this things? Well, lets view some aspects of the series...\r\nSTORY: \r\n  Gon wants to find he's dad, that's the story. Boring, no? Well that's because that is not the story. Hunter x Hunteris about a world, a world full of different scenarios, dramas, inner problems & people, and those people are alive in HxH (keep that in mind till we start talking about the characters).\\n\r\n  Gon is just a tiny tiny grain of sand in a gigantic desert. Defining the \"story\" of Hunter Hunter in a few words is nearly impossible, so long story short, Hunter x Hunter 2011 is a huge world ready to be discovered.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART & SOUND:\\n\r\n  The art in HxH is great, colourful & picturesque scenarios, diverse and complex character designs, well achieved immersive effects, ej: the \"nen auras\" of some blood lust characters, the sensation of fear, panic and sadness. \\n\r\n  But the thing that i like the most in the art of this series, are the elements of the real world that the author bring into his work. There are tons and tons of references, events and things of our world in the anime, for example the references towards Kim Jong-Un, Christianity, Buddhism, the atomic bombs of Hiroshima & Nagasaki, and more...\\n\\n\r\n  Sadness, overwhelming fear, happiness & joy, rage and epicness... You will not want the themes to end. The soundtracks of this series are not just complements, but emotions in its pure state and irreplaceable elements of the experience that is HxH. Pieces like \"Theme of Kage & Rasetsu\", \"Netero's Theme/ Restriction and Pledge\" and Shaiapouf playing the f*cking violin man! Those are things that make Hunter Hunter so characteristic.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCAST:\\n\r\n  You see, the problem with other series is that, sometimes, the characters don't make synergy, sometimes they don't work out because they're not feel alive, the goals that they fought for doesn't convince us and when they form part of a group it feels like they're joined by convenience of the plot rather than by realistic true bound.\\n\r\n  Togashi makes an outstanding work with his main cast and supporting characters, all of 'em are real personas, even the worst villains are full of hopes, aspirations and mindsets...\\n\\n\r\n  The Phantom Troupe or Gen'ei Ryodan are probably one of the best organisations in the entire anime, manga, and literary history at bound/ relationship level. They're a group of merciless dreadful bandits, but before all, they are a family. Each and all of the members truly cares about the rest (or at least the former ones) like they were a real bloodline family. You can feel the camaraderie between them and how the fight, tease, respect and love each other. Their bonds are so close that even if they are cold blooded assassins they will cry rivers and won't forgive anyone that hurts the other members of the Ryodan.\\n\r\n  Besides their goal is not the cliche \"We are *** and we will rule over the world\" nah, their aspiration is to live free and do whatever they want, like a big family. And that's what makes them feel like proper people, they could be breaking in a art gallery and robbing all the art pieces, and just then go to their base to play card games and joke each other. The Phantom Troupe is not just a plot device, they are actual feeling people full of drives and emotions.\\n\\n\r\n  The Royal Guard, formed by Neferpitou/ Shaiapouf and Menthuthuyoupi are also a fascinating example of deep realistic characters.",

Because that\u2019s where you\u2019ll find the things more important than what you want\u201d.  - Ging\r\nI don't have anything else to say other than this is a masterpiece. As such, I'm highly recommending it. I personally liked the fast-paced manner on how they remade the Hunter Exam and the York New City Arc. \r\nThe Chimera arc  was brilliant. Story wise, Hunter X Hunter is one of those on top of its league. Brilliant. \r\nThe art has improved, adding more vibrant palette compared to the 1999 version. It's also quite notable how the Gon and Killuaof this version look younger compared to how they started on the original version.  Nevertheless, the slight change didn't affect the story delivery as a whole so I think it's fine.\\n\\n",
