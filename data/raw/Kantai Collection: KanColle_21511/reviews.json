            "content": "Ever wondered why Touhou doesn't have an anime? This is why.\r\nThere are two perspectives you can watch this show from: Either you played the game, or you haven't. This show is clearly designed to appeal to the former, and does a great job at failing in everything because of that. The thing about making an animated series of something like Kancolle is  that, aside from having the fans seeing their favorite characters being animated, it also gives a chance for them to see the characters develop beyond their limited personality trait in the game. \r\nWhat happens in this 12-episode odyssey is the complete oppositeof that idea.\\n\\n\r\nBefore going any further into this series' embarrassing writing that makes Boku no Pico Shakespearean in comparison, there are several other notable aspects of this show that warrant mentioning: Music, for the most part, is pretty decent. Apparently there seems to be an unspoken rule that terrible shows must have a decent/good soundtrack. Though, having claimed that, it's actually pretty difficult to hear most of the soundtrack because the battle scenes barely last more than a single minute. And yes, I'm being pretty lenient with the term \"battle scenes\" because the visuals are legitimately worse than something from a Toei show. It's not even like YYY where 3DCG scenes were hardly noticeable- It's just literally everywhere in every battle scene in this show, and they're all so incredibly poorly choreographed that it makes you wonder whether a properly functioning human being was responsible for them. \\n\\n\r\n-Spoilers below-\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned previously, this show is something that tries too hard to appeal to the existing fanbase with the smallest effort possible that it fails at its job completely- First, the characters. There are way too fucking many. How did Diomedea manage to include all these 50+ characters in this 12-episode show? The answer is, they didn't. None of them end up being actual characters, and all they get for lines is repetition of the same throwaway line they babble in the game ad infinitum. See, this is the difference between a game and an animated series that tells a story- In games like Kancolle, it's pretty difficult to actually express characters' personality aside from their throwaway lines, so to keep the game interesting, more characters are added to compensate for the lack of further development from the existing characters. But when you're trying to tell a story, that no longer applies- The more characters there are, the harder it is to focus on a certain character(s), and thus, it makes them as bland as they would be in the game when the point of telling a story is the complete opposite: Developing them beyond what would've been feasible in a simple click-and-win game.  \\n\\n\r\nThese characters' gimmicks are also influenced by the fanon- Such as Akagi being a big eater in the show due to her consuming lots of resources in-game. Completely necessary addition, I'm sure. Fubuki, the MC, is incredibly boring and breaks personality several times in-series just to create unnecessary drama, which makes you wonder why the Admiral favors this particular character in the first place outside of her status as the main character. Everyone else can be summed up with a single sentence: Shimakaze likes going fast. Kongou likes speaking in broken English. Hibiki says one Russian word every chance she gets. Yuudaichi likes -poi more than -desu. Sendai really loves night battles. Naka won't shut the fuck up. Calling these protagonists cardboard cutouts would be an insult to cardboard cutouts from Akame ga Kill, so I'm not sure what to call them. \\n\\n\r\nWhat about the antagonists, though? If you expected anything other than \"incompetent mute cyborg zombies,\" then god damn is this show happy to disappoint. I'm not sure what the trend is with all these silent villains that have no real motives, but I guess writing any form of conflict outside of badly animated/choreographed battle scenes was beyond Diomedea's capability. And if that wasn't enough, the Abyssals are pretty pathetic at their job and manage to be as threatening as moving dartboards. I guess they manage to finally sink a character who had a total screen time of less than a minute, who happens to be a friend of a boring friend of the boring MC with a last-second sneak attack. Oh, the horror. It's especially hilarious when the show cuts to Abyssals looking ominous and evil with spooky music playing in the background when they're a complete non-threat.\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally, the Admiral. It's pretty obvious that this Admiral character was designed to represent the viewer/player, which is why this character is never truly shown on the screen. Therefore, the character's motives/personality/appearance are all completely unknown because it's supposed to be \u201cyou.\u201d I'm not sure why this is even necessary considering this character plays a very little role, but apparently it was- Which is why Diomedea decides to fuck that up too by giving this character an identity. Apparently the reason why the Admiral favors Fubuki (the boring MC) so much is that he has a boner for this character. Well, that's great. Now everyone knows that the Admiral is this guy who has a boner for Fubuki, who is the most boring character in a show full of characters solely identified by throwaway lines. What happened to ambiguity, again? Honestly, Wo-class is a much better representation of the viewer- Looking bored and stoned as fuck throughout the entire fucking show pretty much sums up my experience. \\n\\n\r\nAside from the poorly written characters with no effort put into them, there are two other things Diomedea decided to do to \u201cappeal\u201d to the existing fanbase of this series. One is tying in in-game mechanics like repair docks, buckets, upgrades, and etc. Not exactly necessary or hindering, but I'd think that alone should have been enough for references from the game instead of making every character what they are in this show. The second thing is \"historical reenactment\"- Since all the characters are based off of real life ships, the idea is that they would meet the same fate at the same time at the same place. This is sort of \"foreshadowed\" in the opening sequence where you can briefly see the real Akagi ship sinking and is a \u201cmajor\u201d plot point in the latter part of the series. I'm not exactly sure how this is supposed to be an appeal, however. Knowing what's going to happen in the show based on real life events seems completely uninteresting especially considering the flat characters and setting, and if it was any more focused by the series, it would just be yet another cliche'd \"fighting against fate\" plot line that's been done million times over, so I really don't get it. I guess it makes some people feel smug for knowing that this one character that may have been in the background in one episode will sink before other people do.\\n\\n\r\nSo outside of Diomedea's blatantly embarrassing fanservice, what else is there? I guess there's supposed to be a plot somewhere, but the pacing is so horrendous that it's actually difficult to remember what actually happened in this show. That being said, this show does few things that could be considered two of the worst things one can do when writing a story. The first is lack of focus- Just like several other shows, this show cannot decide what kind of a show it wants to be. It could be either a fun show about wacky hijinx, or a serious show with drama that may or may not be forced. If it stuck with one, and did just that, then it would have been fine. Unfortunately, Kancolle attempts to do both, and fails at both- I'm not sure why so many shows do this when both drama and comedy hinder each other most of the time, thus making their simultaaneous inclusion counter productive. I'd assume it probably sounded good on that used toilet paper they used for the storyboard for this show. The amount of sudden mood shifts in this show is transcendent, and this is made even worse with piss-poor pacing. For example, there would be a forced drama scene with Fubuki and her friends. Then it would immediately cut to Ooi and Kitakami doing their usual comedy routine. Then immediately cut back to the drama scene. Flawless.\\n\\n\r\nThe second problem ties into the first- Even the drama is completely forced. And even then, these supposedly sad scenes aren't even relevant or impactful. Because by the end of the episode, it turns out everything was fine all along, which makes the characters seem idiotic for worrying about it in the first place. This problem is especially notable with Fubuki breaking character and doing something reckless against the enemy because suddenly she decided that she wanted to feel important and have a personality. She obviously fails at everything noted above, but this scene itself has also failed at having any lasting impact. No one ends up getting hurt in the end, and everything was daijobu. Then she goes to train with moving targets, which really are as threatening as Abyssals considering how much damage Fubuki came out of it in the end. What a joke. \\n\\n\r\nBut wait, there's more. In the last episode, where everything seems \"hopeless\" because that one mean Abyssal just won't die despite it being only able to shoot out nearly harmless white balls in the protagonists' general direction as its masterful strategy, Nagato suddenly shows up to the rescue- It was all according to plan, apparently. Then when it doesn't work, a new shipgirl appears out of nowhere that got a brief \"foreshadowing\" (using this term extremely loosely) in the previous episode and comes to save the day- Then the Admiral literally uses repair buckets out of nowhere to get more shipgirls in the battle, and the show doesn't even try to hide its Deus ex Machina garbage writing at this point. Then Black Rock Shooter and Fubuki stare at each other before the former realizes this writing is fucking retarded and goes back down the ocean. \\n\\n\r\nBasically, every single episode in this show can be summed down to this: 20 minutes of filler that may or may not include poorly written drama that ends up resolving itself the same god damn episode, and 2 minutes of poorly choreographed battle scene where victory is solely decided by shooting at things a lot with no strategy involved. \\n\\n\r\nIt's incredibly ironic that this show tried so hard to appeal to the existing fanbase that it only alienated them as a result, and ended up appealing to an entirely different group of people who watches shows based on anything but quality. Now, I think it's pretty notable to mention that some people seem to defend this show with claims like \"What did you expect?\" But that sort of claim would only be valid if someone criticized something like Hamtaro for its lack of drama. It's completely invalid here because it doesn't do either drama or comedy because it tries to do both and fails at both. Most criticisms for this show do not come from complaining about what this show doesn't have- It comes from what this show does have and that is fucking awful. Some might also claim \"It's a game advertisement show so it obviously wouldn't be good!\" What about Rage of Bahamut: Genesis? That was a show based on a Mobage, and it was one of the best shows of its season, so that excuse isn't valid either. Any show, no matter what it's based on or which studio's doing it, can have actual effort put into it, and that alone would make any show significantly better than this garbage. The fact is, this show is just a lazy, half-assed attempt to make money off a popular franchise while putting as little effort as possible. And just to emphasize on the point of \"striking while the iron is hot,\" a second season is immediately announced by the end of the last episode. Subtle.\\n\\n\r\nThe best way to describe Kancolle would be that it's basically anti-Touhou. It's everything that Touhou isn't- Kadokawa also apparently decided that it didn't want to put any effort into their \u201cgame,\u201d so they decided to forbid any Kancolle doujin game whatsoever because having to make anything that's more than a clicking simulator would be far beyond their talents. And then they get this show made just to make sure they can rake in as much money as possible before the popularity wears off. Considering how this show turned out, and how many of its existing fans reacted to it, I think it's pretty safe to say that ZUN made the proper decision. And I think it's pretty worrisome if all this makes a drunken man who can't even get human anatomy correct after nearly a decade seem like Albert fucking Einstein.",

            "content": "You know what's great? Cute girls. You know what's even better? Playing a game filled with them. Even better? The fact that they all have good artists and VAs. The best part? The diversity of girls makes it so anyone can find a favorite. You'd think it wouldn't be difficult to make a Kancolle anime considering there are anime with similar kinds of situations such as Strike Witches and Girls und Panzer, but instead of having a healthy balance of slice of life and battles, Kancolle just jumps around everywhere, making for a jarring experience.\r\nThe story is heavily divided, with multiple parts with their ownplot. The parts are segmented into episodes 1-4, 5+7, 6 , 8-9, and 10-12. It winds up being all over the place, tending to be a repeating pattern of slice of life, preparations for sortie, sortie, miracle, and end sortie. Kancolle also tends to tunnel vision on whatever the current episode's plot is and forces the issue. The only overarching drive in Kancolle is Fubuki striving to become one of Akagi's escorts. Honestly, it's how the slice of life elements and combat elements are thrown into the pot together that really inhibit the anime as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nFortunately, the lead designer is great. He really brings to life the ships of so many different artists in one cohesive style. The best part is that the faces are drawn similarly enough to where you can look at both the anime and game styles and see how they correlate. The music is also solid and features a wonderful op and ed. The battle music doesn't quite pack a punch, but still fits thematically.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest issue with the Kancolle anime is how the characters are handled. For some reason the writers decided that having all of the characters keep saying in game lines and slightly modified versions of in game lines was a good idea when it actually destroyed life from the characters. Look, I understand that the lines were probably put in because they wanted an easy way to convey the character's personalities, but it's possible to do it without resorting to such an uninspired method. I don't want to continually hear Hibiki's Russian one liners all the time. I want her to speak full sentences, and if Russian words want to be added in at that point, that's fine. Also, the fact that the admiral is never seen and never talks bothers me a lot. It just makes it feel like it's that way for self-inserting purposes, which just saps any joy from interactions with the admiral.\\n\\n\r\nEven with all of its problems, I did enjoy watching Kancolle; however, I wouldn't recommend it to everyone. It is definitely something that you have to enjoy from the start, otherwise you would just be bored. If anything, episode 6 was the most consistent episode thematically and consequently the most enjoyable. As someone who has loved playing the game for almost a year and counting, this was definitely a disappointing experience. If you are curious about the anime, give it a shot, as you might enjoy it still.",

            "content": "Kantai Collection: KanColle is an Action, Comedy, Slice of life, Military, Sci-fi anime based of the web browser game created by Kadokawa Games. The anime was created by Diomed\u00e9a Studio and was aired on January 8, 2015 to March 26, 2015 and lasting for 12 episodes. \r\nPlot\r\nThe plot follows Special Type Destroyer Fubuki, a young girl who is a Kanmusu, girls who possess a spirit of a naval vessel within themselves and use these spirits to fight the Abyssal fleet who are threatening humanity from the sea. These girls live at naval bases, where they are taught to fight the Abyssal. Fubuki is a newrecruit at one of these naval bases upon her arrival she joins the Third Torpedo Squadron and is sent into battle despite having very limited combat training. While in battle, she is saved by Akagi, An Aircraft Carrier, and afterwards Fubuki decides that she needs to become stronger so she can fight at Akagi\u2019s side.\\n\r\nThe Show does a good job of explaining its story to the viewer by explaining the different kinds of Kanmusu and what the job in the fleet are. While the fighting is keep at a minimal, the focus of the show is based on Fubuki and her comrades while they train at the naval base which is interesting and funny at the same time. Now, because of the anime having so many character and character building, I going to only give the names of girls and what type of Kanmusu they are:\\n\r\nFubuki, Voiced by Sumire Uesaka \u2013 Special Type Destroyer, a part of the Third Torpedo Squadron\\n\r\nMutsuki, Voiced by Rina Hidaka \u2013 Destroyer, a part of the Third Torpedo Squadron \\n\r\nY\u016bdachi, Voiced by Yumi Tanibe \u2013 Destroyer, a part of the Third Torpedo Squadron \\n\r\nSendai, Jints\u016b and Naka, Voiced by Ayane Sakura \u2013 Light Cruisers, a part of the Third Torpedo Squadron with Jints\u016b as Flagship.\\n\r\nAkagi, Voiced by Saki Fujita \u2013 Aircraft carrier, a part of the First Carrier Division\\n\r\nKong\u014d, Hiei, Haruna and Kirishima, Voiced by Nao T\u014dyama \u2013 Battleships, a part of the Second Fleet\\n\r\nNagato and Mutsu, Voiced by Ayane Sakura \u2013 Battleships, Secretaries of the fleet.\\n\r\nKitakami and \u014ci, Voiced by Yuka \u014ctsubo \u2013 Torpedo Cruisers\\n\\n\r\nPresentation\\n\r\nKanColle art style uses a bright blend of colors to breathe life into the show for the viewer. Each of the characters have been given a unique personality, making them stand out compared to one another and easily recognizable to the viewer. The show uses two different animation styles: one for the action scenes and the characters every day life. The use of a different style for the action scenes helps making them more beautiful and interesting to the viewer, thus making them some of the best parts of the show. The voice acting in this is very impressive because of some voice actresses doing multiple characters especially Ayane Sakura, as some of her characters have conversations with each other and the viewer is able to tell which character is talking by their voice. \\n\\n\\n\r\nMy Opinion \\n\r\nKanColle is an anime where I did not know much about before watching, that has made me interested in the Kantai Collection game series. The story, while it not one of the best I've seen was still enjoyable. The characters have been designed with a lot of care in terms of looks and personality, and because of this care the art style over all was appealing to me. The message I got from KanColle is that as long you keep trying your hardest, you can achieve anything you put your mind and heart to. Finally, I love the character development of Fubuki over the course of the show as she always tries her best and doesn't give up. \\n\\n\r\nVerdict \\n\r\nKanColle is one of the anime that while looking at each part separately, like basic story or characters, is nothing special; however, when combined together makes a very interesting show. Anyone, both fans of Kantai Collection or newcomers, can enjoy its characters, art style and story. While there is better stories out there, I still recommend people to give KanColle a go as it takes a common idea and makes it something unique and new to people watching.",

            "content": "Finally, we get to see our shipfus animated.\r\nKantai Collection, or kancolle, is a browser game on DMM where you play as an admiral in charge of a number of ship girls based on WWII ships. You send the ships on sorties and expeditions in your campaign against the abyssals who has taken over Earth's ocean, all while praying to RNGesus that your construction or sortie reward yields the ship you want. Its a nice timesink and appeals a lot to its target audience, with a strong fanbase that rivals that of Touhou. With such a large and dedicated fanbase, its extremely tempting to create ananime adaptation to not only provide fanservice, but to also make a quick buck on its popularity. So they yielded and produced this anime. And how does it fare?\\n\\n\r\nCondensed version:\\n\r\nWhy you may pick this up:\\n\r\n-Plenty of fanservice (ero and non-ero) for those who have played the game\\n\r\n-Poi\\n\r\n-Kongou\\n\r\n-Shimakaze\\n\r\n-Nagamon\\n\r\n-Ship waifus are now animated\\n\r\n-OP and ED (though to be fair, if you only want the OP and ED you can just search on YT or hikari no  akari)\\n\\n\r\nWhy you may skip this:\\n\r\n-Anime does a poor job of introducing game to newcomers or to people who never played kancolle.\\n\r\n-Newcomers and people who never played kancolle will not get the references and fanservice\\n\r\n-Poor plot direction and pacing\\n\r\n-Insufferable CG\\n\\n\r\nLong version: \\n\r\nStory-5: This is the weakest part of the anime. The story is best described as going through an existential crisis; it does not know its purpose for existing. Does it want to tell a gripping tale about a young maiden's perilous journey through Earth's Ocean with her fellow shipgirls, or does it want to be a Madoka clone, or a SOL comedy, or to introduce newcomers to the game, or to provide fanservice for current players? It has the distinction of being all of the above, and yet somehow being none of the above at the same time. It constantly switches between those identities, like at one point the anime is trying to push the fact that a shipgirl has sunk, and at the next the Akatsuki sisters are entering a curry competition, as if that sinking never happened. It should pick an identity and stick to it. We would have been fine with the anime if all 12 episodes were just the shipgirls seating around the Teitoku's office drinking tea and eating cake, and maybe have cameos from the abyssals as well. They may as well call themselves Headquarters Tea-Time.  It\u2019s simple, cheap, fun, provides fanservice for current players, while having many opportunities to introduce the game to newcomers.\\n\\n\r\nArt-7: The art is decent during the non-combat scenes. The managed to make most of the shipgirls look moe enough to keep you going. Artillery designs are all based on art from the game and WWII ships, while all the girls themselves look cute enough, unlike some of their in-game counterparts. The main problem is the CG used during the combat scenes, or when they are water skating. It is extremely jarring to watch. The framerate does not make the animation smooth, and this makes the combat scenes very hard to digest, which in turn, makes admiring the shipgirls difficult. The Character designs somehow gets downgraded as they move in a 3D plane, and ruins the entire experience. Fortunately, these scenes are not prolonged, and we quickly return to the moe 2D girls.\\n\\n\r\nSound-8: One reason you may pick up this anime. Both OP and ED are enjoyable, and the ED is one of my personal favourite ED. The soundtrack used are enjoyable to hear when used during the scene is meant for, but are ultimately forgettable. Artillery firing packs a nice explosive punch to them, and all the VAs do their jobs well enough. The VAs in this anime deserve special mention, as they actually voiced multiple ship sisters, each with their own distinct pitch and tone you could\u2019ve sworn were completely different voice actors. Honorable mention goes to Nao Touyama, who voiced the Kongou sisters, Atago and Takao. Her voices can be extremely different from each other, from Kongou\u2019s  Engrish to Atago\u2019s playfulness, and yet she manages to do make all 6 characters sound like they have 6 different VAs.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters-8: Probably the main reason one might pick up this anime. Fans of the game should ALL have a ship they are extremely fond of, and Kadokawa has recognised this, even giving players the ability to marry the ships that they like. To see them animated, with their VAs saying new unique lines and interacting with other shipgirls, is like a wet dream come true to the player base. The story follows Fubuki, one of the special-class destroyers and a starter ship in the game, as she joins fellow destroyers Yuudachi (poi) and Mutsuki in taking the Ocean back for humanity, one abyssal at a time. The character development in this show suffers because of this, as these three are the only characters that receive any development, the rest being there to provide the viewers a chance to see their shipfus animated. While the other characters are lively and fun to watch on screen, they receive little to no character development. Backstories are left in history books since these shipgirls' history are based on their WWII counterparts, like Sendai's love for night battles since she fought most of her battles at night in WWII, or how Yamato's aversion to the word 'hotel' is based on her being used mostly as a hotel in WWII and barely used for combat. Enjoyable, but unless you have played the game, they are not memorable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-8: As a huge fan of the game, my enjoyment of this anime is, of course, biased, since I understand all the jokes, fanservice, and references made in this anime. To see the shipgirls that I often used in the game animated is glorious eye candy, but was shattered when they transitioned to the CG. I also found that I enjoyed the SoL moments more that the action ones. Just 2 episodes of them making curry and looking for Shimakaze are better than 10 episodes of them fighting the abyssals.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-7: If you are a fan of the game the anime is based on, feel free to watch this. While the CG is painful to watch, one can get over it through the love for their shipfus. For newcomers who wants to know more about the kancolle craze or wants to know more about the game, the English Kancolle wiki the kancolle forums, Himeuta, has FAQs and general information about the game. IF you are a newcomer, play the game and fall in love with the game or a shipfu first before watching, or else most of the jokes, references and cameos will lose its appeal. For people not interested in Kancolle but is a huge anime fan, do not bother with this. A poor story focus and lack of character development in a large cast of characters brings down the anime, with an ending not worth your time. If you want to investigate what the kancolle craze is about, himeuta or the kancolle wiki is more than enough. If not, you are better off spending your precious time watching other anime.\\n",

            "content": "I feel compelled to write a review about this show since it was one of those shows that was fairly hyped during this season and has a unusually high average score for a show this mediocre. As a fan of the game and the general media craze of Kancolle, this show as a whole falls short of being good from any perspective.\r\nFirstly, I'd like to note that unlike a lot of people who like to rate similar to how IGN likes to rate things (i.e. anything below a 7-8 is \"meh\"), and because of it, I generally dislike number ratings, especially ones as bloated asa 1-10 scale, but I will follow the guidelines and base my \"average\" at a 5/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nSpoilers ahead.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nThe premise of the show is the same as the game: some alien beings called Abyssal (a.k.a American forces) have invaded the waters near Japan and conventional weaponry does not work on them, so they do the next best thing: get adolescent girls to bond with the spirit of old Japanese warships, adopting their names in order to fight this new enemy. The fleet are stationed at a naval base where the admiral (who doesn't make an appearance, but is implied that you, the audience, is the admiral) helps shape them into the war machines they need to be. The premise is over the top and makes the show impossible to take seriously, which is the point. It's meant to tease the WW2 and moeblob demographics and provide a general 23~ minutes of pandering each week, which is fine, I enjoyed Strike Witches for doing practically the same thing.\\n\\n\r\nWhere Kancolle differs, and suffers because of it, from Strike Witches, is that the show can't decide if it wants to go full-out fanservice mode and pander to the viewers or make a show with genuine hype and passable writing. A show can do both, but Kantai Collection is not one of those shows. The story starts off giving a really good showcase of the show, with nice action scenes, introductions to the popular ship girls of the game, with some delivering their one-liners and real-life-ship-mirroring personalities, but it never moves forward from that point. From one episode to the next, they keep introducing new ships, sometimes to introduce a new story arc, but most of the time it's just to have them there to cater to anyone who is a fan of that ship.\\n\\n\r\nThere was a moment in one of the earlier episodes where they \"re-enact\" the Battle of Wake Island, which is the battle where the Kisaragi gets scuttled. The episodes ends rather dramatically, building up tension going into the next episode, maybe giving the show a sense of tension and direction, only to have the next episode be a showcase of Kongou and Shimakaze's shenanigans. It was incredibly jarring going from what could have been a moderately emotional story development to a 4-koma esque episode catering to fans of Kongou and Shimakaze, and then going back to conclude Mutsuki's and Kisaragi's arc at the end of that same episode. To put it simply, there were a lot of ideas thrown around in those 2 episodes, but no direction to coherently deliver it.\\n\\n\r\nAfter that point, the show switches into slice-of-life mode, where, you guessed it, they keep introducing more ship girls for one-off arcs that provides very little to any semblance of a story.\\n\\n\r\nThe last third of the show goes back to being a bit more dramatic with the Battle of Midway, the famous battle in which Japan suffered a major loss in the Pacific theatre, and was the battle where one of show's more prominent characters, Akagi, gets sunken. I will say the sinking of Kisaragi did do a good job of baiting the audience into thinking they aren't afraid to stick to historical accuracy, and the episodes leading up to Operation MI did foreshadow Akagi's death, but in true anime fashion, the entire cast comes in to save the day. The final episode also had this theme of \"defying fate\" which basically translates into \"changing real-life history\", but the way it was delivered makes the writers of the show come off as being a little salty about WW2, with a little pinch of nationalism.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: Story is basically Strike Witches but on water instead of air, but with no actual direction and execution, and any sort of potential that the story did have was wasted to pander to fans of the game (which did not work).\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe show started off strong. Like, really strong. In the first episode, when the girls deploy for the first time, we're treated to a rather eye-catching magical girl-esque transformation sequence as they equip their guns and armor. This is a good example of CGI being used moderately well. However, the art quality goes south rather quickly.\\n\\n\r\nThe show mixes the use of 2D drawn and 3D CGI for normal, day to day scenes, and high-movement battle scenes, respectively. The problem comes in when there's any sort of dialogue during the latter scenes. The scenes like to cut from 2D to CGI and back for very little reason, even when there's no actual, high-budget action going on. It becomes even more jarring when there are visual inaccuracies swapping between the two types of animation within the same scene.\\n\\n\r\nBy the end of the show, the budget was obviously running dry with shots like (https://38.media.tumblr.com/5d0dfa0739f4f665b7f76faf19446530/tumblr_nlt5vtpQg11r3fop8o1_500.gif) where assets pop in (and aren't composed properly, as you can tell from the gun barrels cutting off near the edge of the screen after popping in) or shots like this (http://i.4cdn.org/a/1427391382586.jpg) where apparently the girls have 6 fingers on each hand.\\n\\n\r\nThere's also the point that many of the characters suffer from same-face syndrome, and as a result, look nothing like their game-art renditions.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR - Art budget was used mostly in the opening episodes and the girls all look the same, unlike the source game.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending themes were rather enjoyable to listen to and the cast is the same as game, which is a really high point of praise considering the skill of some of the seiyuus. I think one seiyuu voiced 6-7 characters in this show, none of which sound the same, and a few of which interact with each other in the same scenes. It's also a nice touch that the characters have lines directly or draw from their lines in the game.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/10\\n\r\nSpeaking of characters drawing their lines from the game, that's pretty much 90% of the characters outside of the 3-4 main characters. One of the more popular ship girls, Kongou, pretty much serves as a mouthpiece for pandering. Her entire presence can be boiled down to \"Hey, look at me! Look at how historically accurate I am! Look at me deliver the same quotes as in the game every time I'm on screen! Buurniing loooove~~~!!!\".\\n\\n\r\nAs far as development goes, none of the characters actually grow, except for maybe Fubuki, the main character, and even then it takes a horrendously awkward development arc, and it never made care about her throughout the show (apparently, she was chosen to be a part of the admiral's fleet because he had a dream about her in a wedding dress? I get that marrying a ship girl is a part of the game, but did they really have to make a plot point?). And with the supporting cast being so bloated (with new ships being introduced as far as the second half of the last episode), there wouldn't be enough time to make the audience care about them even if the writers wanted to.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nI was really hyped for this show when it first aired. The first few episodes were enjoyable, and I went in knowing this show is just pandering to fans of moe and Kancolle, the game. However, as the show went on, it kept getting more and more boring to sit through the 20 minutes of content, as the fanservice kept being recycled and the end of an episode didn't leave me feeling any better about the franchise than when I started.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThe show would have received a much lower score for its shoddy production quality alone, but being a fan of the game and the general franchise, I'll give it a generous 4/10 as there is some slight enjoyment to be had from the show if you're a fan of the game or the media craze of kancolle.",

            "content": "Where am I? Oh yeah I have a review to do for Winter 2015. \r\nSTORY (4):\r\nKanColle is based on a game adaptation by Kadokawa Games. KanColle is about a group of girls who have the spirit of battleships are on a mission to protect humanity form the abyssal fleet. I mean why can't you call it any other name rather than the generic abyssal fleet?  \r\nIn fact, just like Glasslip. I can understand why people didn't like the anime.\r\nThe story has so many events going on that I barely keep track on anything. I know the concept about the WWII ships are interesting butcome on, please focus on one plot alone. The only later episodes then we see the climactic showdown between the abyssal fleet. The rest of the episodes are the girls do their own thing. Just like Glasslip where characters just do their own thing without any consequence. I thought that if there is conflict in this anime, I thought that could work.\\n\\n\r\nThe concept is interesting however, they fail to expand that idea beyond. They just play the easy way out by throwing in random events like the curry contest. They never explore how curry contest is part of their training programme in order to defeat the abyssal fleet.\\n\\n\r\nART (3):\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is dull. I was like watching a nearly dim show.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (5):\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending are nothing special.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER (4):\\n\\n\r\nThe characters suffer from \"Basic Economics\". When I say that, I mean there are too many characters. Although I did like their determination, this anime introduces too many characters that I lost track on what I saw. Nobody is special if too many people are special. \\n\\n\r\nIn Economics, if there is more supply of something, the demand is less. Just like in KanColle, if there are too many characters, the value of the character development diminishes. Some anime suffered from the same problem as the characters from KanColle like for example Brothers Conflict, Kamigami no Asobi & Strike the Blood.\\n\\n\r\nNot to mention the characters design, they were barely discrete.\\n\\n\r\nI barely see the abyssal fleet. They only appear on the later episodes.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION (4):\\n\\n\r\nAs I have said, if the story and characters have better execution, I thought this anime would be entertaining. However, this anime throws in too many characters, that the enjoyment level decreases. You might say \"Oh! You don't like cute girls\". Not true, I like cute girls. However, if you throw in too many characters, the character value will diminish. I am serious when I say this.\\n\\n\r\nDiomedea took the script, shredded it up, put it in the shotgun, add a lot of characters inside it and shot it at the wall. Then we are asked to connect the dots.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has few good moments, however those good moments are weighed down by the problems of this show. So sadly I have to give this anime a 4 out of 10. If you want better experience, just play the games.\\n\\n\r\nThank you, Winter 2015 for giving me another wonderful anime to review. After reviewing this anime, I will be like \"What was that anime again?\"",

            "content": "The \"Mecha musume\" genre of anime (Which turns WWII weaponry and vehicles into cute girls because why not) has been becoming increasingly popular within the last half-decade or so. With that being said, the idea of turning naval combat ships into adorable fap-mater...I mean waifu-material...seemed like an idea that could not possible go wrong. And so one fateful day, Kadokawa Games created a free-to-play browser game featuring over 9000 (Give or take around 8900) different ship-girls that would go on to live in the dreams of otaku everywhere. Following this explosion of moeboats, Diomedea quickly grabbed the premise of Kantai Collection and set sail towardcreating an anime adaptation, knowing that the fans of the game would be immediately \"On board\" for seeing their favorites ships fully animated.\\n\\n\r\nKeizo Kusakawa (Dog Days/Asura Cryin') came on to direct the series which would immediately receive an influx of mixed reviews. Some viewers hated the anime because it was nothing but cute girls doing cute things. But, on the other hand, that was the exact reason that so many other viewers were praising it. So now, critics are split down the middle in deciding whether or not KanColle is worth watching. And the answer to that really depends on what you are looking to get out of it. If you came for a story, go somewhere else -- this show is most definitely not for you. BUT, if you want to watch adorable boat girls just doing their thing, then get the hell on deck.\\n\\n\r\nThe first episode of KanColle introduces you to Fubuki, a destroyer class ship-girl who will go on the be the main character of the series. Fubuki, unlike the other ships, is incredibly clumsy and has zero combat experience whatsoever. Tired of being the weakest of them all, Fubuki goes on to practice day and night in an attempt to not weigh down her fellow boats. After a solid mix of naval combat and fan-service scenarios, Fubuki gains many new friends who will go on to shape the experience of what Kantai Collection really is -- a fun show. But are fun and good interchangeable? That's something you must decide for yourself. But I'm sure you'll get a grip of how I feel about it after I break it up over the next few paragraphs and weigh in on each aspect of the show.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 7/10\\n\r\nThe music of KanColle is actually pretty good. The soundtrack blends traditional Japanese styles with fast-paced and dramatic rock music riddled with miniature guitar solos. The music becomes essential for expanding the atmosphere of the fight-scenes (Which there are a handful of in the show). And the music in KanColle doesn't function the same way that a lot of soundtracks do, meaning it doesn't really blend in. You can always tell that it's there, the impact is not subtle at all. This is both good and bad, considering it can also work as a distraction. One other thing though, is that when the music ISN'T playing, something seems amiss. Like the scenes are too bland without it. And unfortunately, this happens more often than you would think.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\r\nThe sheer amount of characters you come across in Kantai Collection is extravagant. But that is to be expected when the game has a total of 156 playable girls (That number is still rising, by the way). Obviously, not all 156 of the girls get screen-time in the anime. But even without that, it will still be easy to choose a favorite considering how different they all are from one another. However, if you don't choose Kongou as your favorite, you obviously don't know what you're doing. Character development really isn't a factor for anyone other than Fubuki. But the thing with Fubuki is that her development seems a little rushed. Her transition from \"Insanely weak and useless\" to \"Overpowered and unbalanced\" comes along rather quickly. And even though this is a problem, it does not overshadow how delightful and varied the boatgirls in KanColle are.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nI think it's safe to say that Diomedea has outdone themselves with the artwork in Kantai Collection. Out of all of the series they've done that I have had the chance to watch, this one is far superior. Character design is great and stays loyal to the source material. The enemies are dark and gloomy which contrast with the bright and vivid atmosphere of the rest of the show in a way that is basically impossible to ignore. Frankly, I was extremely impressed. When I got myself into this show I wasn't expecting anything phenomenal in the art department, but I quickly retracted those thoughts as the show progressed. HOWEVER, the one thing I really disliked as far as art went was when 3DCG was brought into the mixture. Adding dimension to the girls during floating (Or swimming? Sailing? I don't know what to call it) really took away the detail of their character just seconds prior. It created an inconsistent situation where I could love the image of a character in one scene and then go on to hate it in the next. In my opinion, the art should have just stayed 2D through the entire show.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 4/10\\n\r\nI wouldn't go as far as saying there is no story in KanColle. I would, however, say that literally no one cares about it. Not even the writers. Everyone was just more concerned with watching all the moeboats interact with each other. And those scenes of interaction were great. But every once and a while, KanColle tried to slip some naval battle you didn't care about under the radar in an excuse to further develop Fubuki. I get what the writers were going for, but it really just didn't work. KanColle was unsuccessful in creating a story line that viewers cared about. When that happens, there really isn't much hope for its progression. The story starts to \"sink\" in a way. Ha. Ha ha. Anyway, like I said earlier on in the review -- if you came here for a story, you might as well go watch something else. But if you want to watch different groups of girls act all cute and funny, register for a Crunchyroll account and go check this out. You won't be let down.\\n\\n\r\nThe one thing I wan't to add before I finish up this review is the amount of enjoyment I got out of this show. We can sit here all day and talk about \"What makes a show good\". But as far as I'm concerned, enjoyment has a harder impact on that than anything else. KanColle looks great, sounds great, and a ton of laughs for anyone that is just looking to have a good time. I highly recommend it for anyone that has room left in their \"Favorite characters\" column on MyAnimeList.",

            "content": "When the anime for Kantai Collection was announced and a trailer was released, a milestone was placed for a million fans already set in place. While most were happy and excited for the adaption of the most popular casual game in Japan, people who were already familiar with anime and the tropes associated with the media were worried. This was because the production company was a relatively unknown studio, the art was vastly different from the pixiv artists that make the original character pictures, the ever infamous CGI was going to be used, and with all things that attempt to cater to too many people,artistic liberties were likely to be protracted for a generic anime. Unfortunately, generic is exactly what Kantai Collection is and even as an original fan of the game who went in with little expectations I felt disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nFor those unfamiliar with the series, Kantai Collection (Or Kancolle short) is an online game about ship girls that take their designs based on World War 2 Japanese naval war vessels. Destroyers, battleships, aircraft carriers, you name it. Heavily reliant on moe and the popular concept of girls with war machines (Like Strike Witches and Girls und Panzer), it has become arguably the most popular game in Japan and even parts of Asia not only for otakus but for the casual people as well. The girls fight monstrous demons that rise from the ocean... And well, that's about it for the plot and setting. Not much information on the world is really given and the different sources like the manga and light novels are not official.\\n\\n\r\nThis is perhaps the biggest problem with the Kancolle anime. Perhaps in order to stay faithful to the game, no real world exploration, setting, or story is set in place. It isn't exaggeration to say the plot of Kancolle is literally just naval fleet girls fighting against monsters with added slice of life in the mix. There is no explanation for how the girls \u201cinherit\u201d the souls of World War 2 ships, no exposition on the current state of the world, no details on what humanity is doing and why they have to rely on the girls, no details on how the Abyssals work. The show blatantly just puts out \u201cit's just how it is\u201d and ends the plotline there. And sadly all of this lacking information makes the Kancolle anime feel that it is devoid of substance and leaves many questions unanswered not only for the fans of the original game but for newcomers as well. \\n\\n\r\nThis may have not been so bad if the presentation of the show was well done (As sometimes leaving the audience to their imaginations can be entertaining) but the show simply isn\u2019t. It starts off with the inexperienced girl Fubuki who joins a naval base and slowly pushes herself to become better and be accepted as a regular fleet girl. She makes comrades, goes through training montages, and becomes one of the top fleet girls through hard work and determination. Sound familiar already? It should be as this type of story has been done an exuberant amount times before in anime (especially shounen) and any other type of media really. The plot and script follows a terribly formulaic procedure that is it almost insultingly lazy. And sadly as the episodes drag on they become more and more predictable for any anime veteran that has seen the tired recycled tropes that Kancolle constantly uses.  \\n\\n\r\nWith respect to spoilers, there is a particular early episode in the series that attempts a terrible gimmick to grab the interest of the audience (You will know when you see it). It is perhaps one of the worst written, predictable, and incredibly asinine things to have been done in anime and even the most hardcore fans are likely to be put off by it. Sadly, most of the episodes fail to improve where a chunk of the time is spent on low-tier generic dialogue, fan joke \u201cinside\u201d comedy memes, and then a few terrible build-up of melodrama that\u2019s more cringey than B- movies.\\n\\n\r\nI do by no means hate slice of life, Kancolle just does a terrible job at it as it is filled with a main cast of girls who are uninteresting, boring, and unappealing, arguably even for the fans of the game, and the interactions they have with one another are incredibly bland. When the girls aren\u2019t spouting lines from the online game, they are droning on endlessly about the food they just ate, how nice looking someone\u2019s room is, or regurgitating repeatedly and unnecessarily about the mission they are undertaking. The writing feels as though the script maker and director wanted to waste time and fulfill their 20-minute-a-episode quota rather than try to make enjoyable interactions. The main cast is dull, the side characters are dull, the script is dull, and the anime constantly reuses the same jokes over and over again as cumbersome service to the game fans. The sad part is that the anime should be a platform to better develop the girls from the game and give a wider outlook to the depth of characters, but you would find more characterization and details in to personalities looking at a fleet girl\u2019s Wikipedia page than the entirety of this anime. \\n\\n\r\nIn regards to other production values, the battles are all done in CGI which for the most part look fairly fine and is actually done well, at least when you can ignore the awkward looking faces and the strangely placed transition between drawn scenes and CGI that happen from time to time. When the girls are fighting the CGI is acceptable, but tends to look horrible when the girls are talking and out of the battle transitions. Those who detest CGI in their anime best stay away. While the first few episodes are interesting to see exactly how the water-skating fleet girls fight, especially the first episode that shows a beautiful amount of details and work, the future battles are sadly not the same. Do not be misled by the first episode\u2019s battle; past the opening episode the battles become mundane with generic looking enemies and lazily-made shooting sequences that fail to make full potential naval warfare can have.\\n\\n\r\nThe art itself is mediocre at best and fans may notice a rather drop in quality of their favorite girls (Which may not be entirely blamed on the production company as the online game pictures use various different pixiv artists). There is a number of musical scores within the anime that are soundly produced and pleasing to the ears, and some of the pieces do well to convey the emotions of a scene where the bad script of Kancolle fail. There is a plethora of good voice actors like Nao Touyama and Yuka Iguchi as those who are familiar with the game may know. Unfortunately, the musical ensemble and voices are the best praise this show can receive.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Kantai Collection is everything that is to be expected for good or bad. It's a below average generic show with mediocre writing mostly due to the fact that the producers and director of the show have to cater to an existing fanbas. It is a show that refuses, or is forced not to break out of the mold for any bit of artistic integrity and originality. There are a number of definite fanservice that only the game fans may appreciate; but they are so awkwardly placed within the frame of the anime they feel asinine rather than anything clever and certainly fail to aid new people to the franchise understand Kancolle. With gimmicky writing and no sound source to draw from besides the game which already lacks information on the setting, Kantai Collection simply cannot pass that line to be exceptional or anything ground breaking. It's not a show that I could recommend to someone who isn't a fan of the game or for those that have already watched a lot of anime and can easily predict how the show will proceed. For those who are fans I can only say keep your standards low and expect the expected. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "TL;DR: At face value, it's a cute girls doing cute things show that combines Japanese otaku's two favourite fetishes: high school girls & military hardware. However, as the series progresses, it seems that Kancolle is not only meant as harmless fetish porn, but is in fact an attempt to deal with Japan's demons over their defeat in World War Two by having cute girls dress up as boats & literally blowing those demons up. For all its ham-fisted handling of the subject matter, it's good for a laugh, albeit in a \u201cif you can't laugh, what can you do?\u201d kind of way.\r\nAnyone who follows internationalnews may have seen Japan put its foot in it, so to speak, when it comes to its approach to remembering World War Two. Be it angering South Korea when government figures call for the retraction of Japan's recognition of \u201ccomfort women\u201d as being sex slaves, or Prime Minister Abe angering everyone when he very publicly paid his respects at Yakasumi shrine, it seems that Japan, or at least a sizeable proportion of its population, continues to struggle with how to conceptualise & remember this period in history, or how the echoes of it continue to reverberate in South-East Asian & world politics today.\\n\\n\r\nThis might seem an odd way to start a review of Kancolle (not to mention being simplistic to the point of offensive), an adaptation of a popular pay2win game where cute girls dress up as warships from the Imperial Japanese Navy to fight demons. Well, strictly speaking they posses the spirits of said warships, but it amounts to the same thing. Our protagonist, Fubuki, is the new girl at the all girls scho...navel base where they train to fight the mysterious demons from across the seas. As you'd expect, Fubuki is high on determination & resolve but low on talent or skill, the bulk of the series being about her gradual rise from being barely able to float to becoming the most important battle boat in the babefleet. In addition to her, we have a vast ensemble of other girls whose one dimensional character types loosely match with the ships they represent (the pirate lolis are destroyers, the elegant seniors are carriers etc etc). Much like Girlfriend BETA, the cast is so large that really you can't even try to remember who they all are, or why what they're doing is supposed to matter. (note that from this point things will be discussed that may be considered spoilers)\\n\\n\r\nA lot of Kancolle looks & feels cobbled together from other cute girls shows. There are girls who make animal noises because moe. There's a girl with random mascot creature companions because every show has to have mascots. The bigger ship girls love eating mountains of food because otaku love busty girls with big appetites. There's a random cooking episode in the middle of the series because why wouldn't there be (no points for guessing that they cook curry). There's yuri undertones all over the place & Fubuki has a serious \u201cnotice me, senpai\u201d girl crush on fleet carrier Akagi because of course she does. Even the more serious sides to Kancolle feel like they're just going through the motions. A mentor character dies in episode three because a mentor character always dies/disappears to mark the end of Act 1, only in this case you'd only really know her to be that type of character if you know the history of the ship, since her on screen time is negligible. Even the ending, which is ultimately a we'll fight to change our fate showdown, feels like it could have been taken from almost any other action based anime out there. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, draped around all this generic storytelling & characters is something that becomes increasingly uncomfortable viewing as the show moves towards its climax. As already said, all the girls in the babefleet posses the spirit of an actual IJN warship from World War Two. Indeed, while the plot progresses in a pretty standard way, Kancolle does make an effort to ensure that when things happen to specific girls, it mirrors in some way the actual events their warship counterpart were involved in. Why is this problematic? Well once you see Kancolle as in effect a re-enactment of the Pacific War with cute girls, their demonic enemies can only been seen as the US navy (& possibly also the Royal navy, though less explicitly). Indeed, the final battle is an unapologetic re-imagining of the Battle of Midway, complete with a demon carrier that is easily interpreted as a stand in for the USS Yorktown, where the Japanese win. It's made even more questionable by the preceding event having been a surprise attack by the demons on their main navel base, as though it's not enough to imagine winning at Midway but they had to be the victims of Pearl Harbour too. \\n\\n\r\nIf this had been a German movie re-imagining the Battle of Stalingrad as a glorious Nazi victory, or an American one re-imagining Gettysburg as a heroic victory for the Confederacy, one might imagine it would piss people off a bit. Yes, you can say it's only fiction, & Kancolle is certainly making sure to look as fantasy as possible. But the moment you combine fiction with real events you are in effect expressing a view on those events, & Kancolle's seems to be that its audience should not only be proud of their wartime military but in fact celebrate the military aggression it was involved in, presenting the whole thing as in fact a defensive war against a demonic foreign power that couldn't be reasoned or negotiated with. \\n\\n\r\nWhen looked at in it's current day context, Kancolle ties in with both pressure from the Japanese right on the government (including from some of its own members) to revise what they see as a defeatist & emasculating view of Japan's wartime past & the increasingly bellicose calls for re-militarisation of the Japanese armed forces, including the right to expand the Japanese navy, under the mantra of \u201ccollective self-defence.\u201d Yes, you can say it's just a niche late night fanservice anime that hardly anyone watches & seeing it as anything more is just over thinking, but I disagree. For one, cultural products are not created in a vacuum, & at the very least Kancolle depicts the views the creators &, one assumes, their target audience hold. There are no neutral observers of history & Kancolle choosing to depict its version of history in the way that it does is no accident. It might hide its ideas behind more obvious fan service, but they're still there & they're clearly not meant to be ignored by the audience, even though you can always choose to do so.\\n\\n\r\nOn the subject of fan service, Kancolle is, as you'd probably expect, riddled with it (I'm aware this is a rather awkward tonal shift, from discussing history to boob grabs, but bare with me). When I first heard of Kancolle, I thought it would be more like Girlz und Panzer, in that it would be about actual warships crewed by high school girls. The reality is something much more laughable, as the girls instead transform into weaponised versions of themselves Nobunagun style. I don't know why it was considered good character design, but what this amounts to is girls in high school uniforms, on jet skis, with scale model parts of their ship class stuck to their clothes. It does work to a degree with the carriers, which are depicted as archers whose arrows turn into aircraft upon firing, but for all the others it just looks stupid. Of course, it allows for the girls to strike lots of clich\u00e9 & titillating body poses while firing, so I guess if your fetish is girls wearing bits of boat, it's got you covered.\\n\\n\r\nIt's ultimate form of fan service, however, comes in the shape of the mysterious admiral. In case you were wondering if there are any male characters in Kancolle, there is one. You never see more than his shadow, but he is always there, always with the right plan for victory. All the girls worship him & Fubuki outright loves him, with one out of nowhere dream sequence involving her in a white dress, confessing while looking straight into the camera. Who is this mysterious, genius Lothario, you ask? Well that's simple: he's you*. You, the (presumed male) viewer &/or player who fantasise as is always assumed in cute girl shows that everything the cast do, they do for & because of you. You're awesome, guy watching a cartoon about 13-18 year old girls in revealing clothes, striking sexy poses while playing with phallic military hardware when they're not playing with each other. Shine on you crazy diamond. (at this point the reviewer caught his reflection in the monitor & cried)\\n\\n\r\n*One could also read the faceless admiral as Kancolle's way of getting around depicting Admiral Yamamoto, the actual mastermind behind the Battle of Midway & someone whose actual depiction in a otaku pandering show like Kancolle would have probably caused the producers far more of a headache than it would be worth.\\n\\n\r\nKancolle, then, is a fairly standard action anime with cute girls that does manage to distinguish itself, but ultimately in all the wrong ways. Viewed purely as a TV show, stripped of all context or implication behind its subject, it's not bad but at the same time it makes it very obvious that it is doing everything it can to pander to it's intended audience to the point of obnoxiousness. In a broader context, it is an uncomfortable example of Japan's continued struggle to come to terms with it's role in World War Two or how that role continues to shape the opinions of Japan held by other countries. Hayao Miyazaki said of making \u201cThe Wind Rises\u201d that he felt torn between viewing Japan's military aggression as having been foolish but taking pride in the Zero as a machine & the bravery of the pilots that flew it. Kancolle lacks such a conflicted view, & either by intention or an accidental by-product of poor writing presents a counter-factual version of history where Japan was both victim & victor. It'll take more than a wide eyed girl in a short skirt to make me agree with that.",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nIn an anime like KanColle, with all of its ships, all of its \"moe,\" and all of its torpedoes, there actually exists something that the audience can relate to. And that is the idea of support. Everyone needs help, from the student looking to get tutored for the next exam to the adult wanting to learn how to use the computer. We almost can't get through our daily lives without someone, in some form, providing some kind of aid in our direction. And receiving such support can often times be both a rewarding and eye-opening experience.\r\nSTORY\r\nKanCollefollows young Fubuki, an up-and-coming Destroyer Class ship looking to do what she can in a war that involves her, her friends, and her beloved Admiral.\\n\\n\r\nKanColle is a show that only anime could tackle; essentially, all of the girls from Kaga to Naka are anthropomorphized navy vessels, having turned from venerable war machines into really cute girls. While technically a \"Military\" genre anime, the show is mostly a slice-of-life offering, aiming to showcase the girls at various points in their training, lives, and careers as battle cruisers. And for the most part, the anime is able to pull this off. One tactic used to accomplish this goal is by divvying up the screen time for the majority of its cast. While Fubuki garners the most limelight, the show often times splits characters into respective groups, and even occasionally changing said groups up. In this way, the anime gives the audience the chance to watch their favorite ship do everyday things, from bathing, to eating, and even cooking. Another tactic is in the very nature of a militarized zone: each girl is relegated to specific tasks. While the majority of the girls are designed for battle -- Akagi, Kongou, and Yuudachi come to mind -- some are designed for other, more nuanced tasks. For example, Nagato is the overall leader, Yamato has her own \"hotel,\" and Hibiki is used for collection. By separating the ships into further, more specific roles, when the anime naturally transitions from one location to the next, so do the characters involved.\\n\\n\r\nThe slice-of-life antics only make up about half of the anime; the other half moves into the aforementioned military facet. Here, the various girls actually start to be the very war vessels they actually are. It's at this point the show really begins to suffer. KanColle would like these battles to have any significant meaning attached to them, but sadly there isn't any to be had. While a wide range of girls receive attention, the amount isn't enough to constitute a connection deep enough to warrant their predicaments worthy of drama. Instead, it feels lacking, forced even, that the girls are placed within these situations. And such a feeling also comes from the purpose of the battles themselves; the victory never does anything. They may fight for an island or protect a strategic location, but the outcomes of the fights are always the same: win, go back to base, and wait for the next skirmish.\\n\\n\r\nAmong the cuteness and firepower, KanColle does at least attempt to have some sort of thematic presence throughout its run. \"Attempt\" is the operative word, because the show somewhat fails at doing so. It sticks to the general and tired themes that most cute anime strive for: dealing with hardship, learning to accept others, and fighting against destiny. Nice little motifs, and certainly insights that one can take to heart, but none are looked at extremely seriously and only there for the structure of the anime. Think of the themes as a stack of paper; one piece is pulled from the stack and used to hold the show up. But since it's just one piece of paper, it breaks under the weight it is holding. Yet before it falls, it is held up by the next piece of paper -- the next theme -- only for the process to continue repeating indefinitely. It's not until the entire stack is placed underneath that the anime is prevented from falling. This interconnected support is literally just that: a theme of support. For while each individual, fun message is fine, what they all have in common is this idea of supporting one another, no matter the circumstance. And that's something that is not only consistent throughout the anime, but makes sense in context; whatever kind of military it is, supporting each other is the number one goal.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nKanColle is a mixed bag when it comes to its art and its animation.\\n\\n\r\nThe art for the show can actually be quite nice at times, but it largely depends on location. When the girls are at home base, the track field, mess hall, and dorms may not be detailed exquisitely but it still looks rather pretty. Yet, just like the move from slice-of-life to military, when the girls move onto the water, all of that art disappears. It's replaced with a lot of sky and ocean, with such a replacement losing any flair the show may have generated.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs for each of the ships are nicely done. The girls are given unique outfits depending on the character -- Yamato has her umbrella, Shimikaze has her bunny ears, and Atago has her blue pilot's outfit, to name a few. Furthermore, they each have their own, specialized weaponry to go along with their persons. Depending on the class and the size of the girl, their cannons match accordingly.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to actual animation, it's a bit of a toss-up. When the girls are on their missions, the use of CG isn't too jarring, but the use of their weapons and the maneuvers they pull off aren't anything extraneous. It's usually them standing still, one arm out, and a bunch of smoke that covers the screen. When they're not out on the water, their casual conversations and simple motions are still of the same complexity; quite average.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nKanColle contains quite the large cast. The majority of the characters don't see significant progress, but here it's prudent to take a look at three of the most important from the show: Fubuki, Yamato, and Mutsuki.\\n\\n\r\nTaking the lead, Fubuki is the average main character. She's kind and intelligent, but it's obvious that her skills are far lower than the others in the troupe. She struggles and fights to earn her place among their ranks, wanting to prove to herself and to everyone that she is capable of being the Destroyer that she is. This drive, this incessant need to be more than she is, is what the Admiral sees in her that the rest cannot. It's not so much that she has the largest guns, or can fire the biggest torpedoes, or has the greatest accuracy. What she provides is something intangible, something that not a lot of people immediately have. And that's courage. The courage to train from morning to night without rest. The courage to face your faults, to fix your mistakes. The courage to take a chance rather than holding back. And in this way, her fortitude gives her not only the ability to lead those around her but also support the very ships she calls friends. So while she may be the stereotypical hero, her exemplification of the underlying theme of the anime marks her as at least being slightly more than generic.\\n\\n\r\nIn a stranger position is Yamato. Her enormous firepower makes her the fleet's secret weapon. But because of this, she's kept hidden away, unused in battle and forced to toil on an island that rarely gets visitors. She feels both lonely and worthless for these reasons, which, in a rather interesting way, makes her Fubuki's previous self. For Fubuki was in the exact same position; on the outside looking in and not being able to work with the girls she had come to respect. And so Yamato learns from Fubuki. She sees her determination, drive, and dedication at doing whatever it takes to fix the situation at hand. This instills in Yamato her own sense of purpose; that while she may be constrained to a more unique role, that doesn't mean she isn't valuable in some form. Thus Yamato gains her own kind of courage, showing up when the going got tough and proving to the girls and to the audience that everyone has a purpose.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the strangest of the ships, though, is Mutsuki. She's overtly sweet, always shouting niceties and aiding the friends around her. What's interesting is that she is rarely seen in battle; she makes a few appearances, but her prominence is her location outside of it. And that is usually in a flower field, near a shrine, or at the pier, where she is most often found believing in the aptitude of the ships at sea. She's not particularly noteworthy for her battle prowess, nor is she famous for being one of the cuter girls. In a way, she acts the most human, praying, wishing, and wanting the girls to perform to the best of their abilities, cheering from the sidelines rather than being the very vessel she is known to be. She experiences difficult times -- the loss of the girl she looks up to -- which tests her will, but, in true Fubuki fashion, Fubuki gives Mutsuki the courage necessary to continue believing in the ships around her. For nobody goes through life without problems, thus making how you deal with those issues to be the most important lesson.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe OP contains quite the strong singer, whose vocal power carries the entire track from start to finish. The hard guitar and drum beat work nicely in unison, and help to support the vocalist throughout. The lyrics and tune can be catchy at certain points, though it is still an overall alright piece.\\n\\n\r\nOnce again, the singer takes center stage in the ED. Although here, it features something weird: fast, catchy lyrics. The song is at first not that good of a listen, but after hearing it a few times, one gets used to the guitar, chimes, and quick singing, making the piece the stronger of the two.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack often fits the mood for the show, depending on whether it is partaking in the slice-of-life or military genres it falls under. The former usually uses piano and violins for those everyday sounds, and a single-drum for that training feel. The military aspects, in contrast, incorporate orchestral music for a more resounding vibe. Trumpets and violins work overtime during these scenarios, making the fights gain a heightened feeling of importance. Also of note are the cannon, gunfire, and ocean sound effects that give the battles further realism.\\n\\n\r\nAs for voice acting, those involved give above-average performances. Special shout-outs are in order for Ayane Sakura for voicing what seems to be half of the cast and Yuni Tanibe for her signature \"Poi!\"\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to anime, I'm a fan of cuteness. And while not all of the girls were fun to watch on screen, some were quite entertaining to see. My favorites from the show were Yamato and Nagato for their attractiveness, while Oochi and Kitakami's relationship nearly always got me to laugh or smile. On the other hand, though, I despised Mutsuki. Just the combination of her voice and her extreme sweetness had me wanting her to leave the screen as quickly as she appeared.\\n\\n\r\nThat's pretty much it in terms of enjoyment. The rest of the girls are alright, and there can be some cute moments here and there, but there is nothing entirely memorable. The actual battles, watching the girls at sea fighting against the enemy, were where the anime really began to lag. Instead of seeing the \"cute girls being cute,\" I was instead treated to warfare that wasn't all that impressive or fun to watch. A lot of screaming, a lot of explosions, but zero adorableness.\\n\\n\r\nAs an anime, KanColle does what it set out to do. Its average story and characters are backed by a good amount of cuteness and some interesting sound work, making the whole package an alright experience. At the end of the day, though, there isn't much more to it than that.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fine, interesting slice-of-life, meaningless battles, and individually weak yet collectively strong themes\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Fine, mix of good and bad art, nice character designs, average actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Fine, Fubuki is good, Yamato and Mutsuki are okay, with the rest not seeing significant progress\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fine, okay OP, okay ED, okay soundtrack, nice sound effects, above-average VA work\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Fine, some of the girls are fun to watch, some are not, with the actual ship aspect being rather boring\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 5/10",

            "content": "Kantai Collection or KanColle is an anime adaptation of a hit web browser game. I haven't played the game or seen it. But what I did see before this anime came were pictures, lots and lots of pictures of girls with guns. Not just any guns, torpedoes, missiles, cannons and what not. And of course, I was intrigued as to whether this game would ever become an anime. When the anime was announced, I put it at the top of my list since I wanted to see what awesome action we would get.\r\nThe series started off good, it didn't give as much action as Ithought but the animation and art was splendid except for the CGI part (no one likes CGI). But still, this anime was really good and as a slice of life, military, action style anime, it does a good job.\\n\\n\r\nStory 7/10:\\n\r\nLow score because there isn't much of a story. It's just girls who are ships fighting abyssals or enemy ships/girls. The whole anime surrounds Fubuki, a Destroyer ship who joins the Naval District. She makes friends, trains to become stronger and has senpai's she looks up to. That's the slice of life part. For those who think this is gonna be a dark type war with blood, gore, deaths and some psychological stuff, don't be mistaken. The war barely puts a dent in the happy atmosphere that surrounds the series. Yeah, they do go fighting but that's all there is. The effects of the battle wear off as soon as they return and live like normal girls going to class etcetera etcetera.\\n\\n\r\nThough near the end of the series, stuff gets a bit serious and the war takes a higher importance than the slice of life.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10:\\n\r\nAside from the CGI, the artwork was pretty amazing. Each and every character is awesomely designed. I've seen artworks all over the internet but I think this anime did a pretty good job in the art department. I couldn't find a single character that I can say has a bad design. As for the abyssals, only some have a humanish figure whereas the others are just fish type things with cannons.\\n\r\nThe backgrounds are also really pleasing. So don't worry about the animation in this anime. But you'll have to make it through the battles which mostly take place with CGI   which I do not understand why they did. \\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10:\\n\r\nThe opening \"Miiro\"  is epic. Loved this song. Good enough to download and listen to all the time.\\n\r\nThe ending \"Fubuki\" is also good. Rarely have I seen anime having great opening and endings. The sound gets a 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10:\\n\r\nThere are different types of ship in the navy. Each having it's own abilities, arsenal and tasks. The same is with KanColle. Each girl has a different ship to her. Some are Destroyers, carriers, battleships etc. But they are not alone. In the Naval District, there are tons of Destroyers, carriers and other ships. Each having her own duty. Some are teachers, some manage the district while others study, train and go into battle.\\n\r\nAside from their roles as ships, they are like any other character from an anime. Just think of the girls as from a school slice of life anime. Friends, rivals, senpais and teachers. That's how the characters are. And each has her own unique personality to contribute to the show.\\n\r\nOur main lead, Fubuki is a hardworking girl who doesn't know much at first, but trains to become stronger. Alongside her, are her friends who also take part in training and who worry for her when she gets in trouble or gets injured. Fubuki and her friends are sort of like the first years of a school.\\n\r\nThen come the seniors. Veterans in warfare and having amazing skills, they are the senpais everyone looks up to. Of course, rivalries exist and some grudges too but not so much to spoil the warm atmosphere the Naval District has.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10:\\n\r\nI don't know how can one not enjoy this series (aside from the CGI parts). You've got some fillers to lighten up the mood and your average slice of life just to give this military anime a warm feeling. When the battles start, stuff gets intense, with planes flying around, cannons firing, ships sinking. But like any other slice of life anime, KanColle tends not to kill off many girls even though it is a war.\\n\r\nThe mechanics of the anime are figured out as it progresses. As I didn't play the game, it took some time for me to know how these girls are ships and why the rest or eat as they do.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a good anime. A really good anime for this season. If you've seen pics of any KanColle characters on the net, I'm sure you would want to see this anime too and go ahead, it's worth it. And the best thing is that it's getting a sequel. So many new characters yet to see in action.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Don't take my score rating at face value. Kancolle (the anime) is a mesh of conflicts which makes it difficult to rate, also because of its target audience.\r\nThe anime, before it aired, was announced to be crafted to exhibit a slice-of-life/battle ratio of 70%/30%, and that is where the problem lies. The anime basically hands you a platter of samples from the Kancolle universe but doesn't quite put in the effort to ensure that each sample is well crafted and fully developed.\r\nLet us start with the slice-of-life part first. Here's a warning to those who don't play the game: You won't get much of itat all. Most of the slice-of-life humour and interesting points stem from puns (like the Curry Operation) from the game and real history, to the characters' personalities which are well-exhibited in the game. Even for people who play the game, unless you know your waifus well (i.e. you understand the Japanese lines they say), you will also not be able to catch much. The scripts have the game's lines well weaved in in most parts, and almost every other line you hear will be either an exact or slightly modified line from the game. To fans, this is probably the most appealing part, because it brings out the personalities of each shipgirl and makes them come alive. Some people might dislike the overuse of in-game lines, but I'd say it's most of the time done quite appropriately, and is likely the best way to show the character's personality that we're familiar with.\\n\\n\r\nBonuses are included as well. \"Unexpected\" character behaviours like Nagato (aka Nagamon) and Zui-Kaga are included too, which are based off the fanfics. Good effort! Apart from that, the slice-of-life plot, is typical: entertaining, relaxing, and nothing much happens. Well done!\\n\\n\r\nThe battle scenes are on the whole not too bad, apart from the awkward CGI here and there (and my friend spotted a single frame render error as well). Problem is, it's split as well. About half the battles, mostly at the beginning of the anime, are pretty exciting and nice to watch (they feature the fairies in the planes too!), but then after that it falls stale towards the later part of the anime. By the time you get to the end, it's really nothing new, apart from just more and more ships getting involved and starts to feel cheesy. The battle scenes are the part of the anime which doesn't really require you to know the game since the game battles are not very similar, but it doesn't impress both audiences, which is a shame.\\n\\n\r\nDrama in the show is also very awkward. There are some heartfelt scenes, and I must say I thought the anime (hint of a very slight spoiler here) was going to build up nicely from about ep 3 and ep 4, but it doesn't. The drama doesn't flow from one episode to another well, if any at all. While that's not a problem for slice-of-life, the writers decided to (try to) inject lots of seriousness in certain places, and because it just fizzles out by the next episode without a hint to its previous existence, the whole thing feels contrived.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development is practically zilch, except for the main character, Fubuki, who gets a bit. But I can understand that because it wants to stay true to the game, the characters can't change much. Also, some personalities (like Kongou) are based off the history of the ship itself, and so can't be changed much. With such a wide cast of characters, you'd be hard pressed to find enough time (for the slice-of-life segments) or impact (for battle and drama scenes) to develop any character in particular.\\n\\n\r\nSo on the whole, the anime is just very awkward because all the elements cancel each other out. You get heavy scenes of drama and battles only to be totally forgotten by light-hearted ones later as though none of that happened. They are not particularly well executed either.\\n\\n\r\nOP and ED of the anime is great, and I think, if it was more focused on battles, these songs would fit it very well.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, you'd have to be in to this show for the characters to enjoy it, I'd say, and thus, you'd need to know the characters WELL either by seeing lots of fanfic or playing the game (or both!), otherwise the good parts will just fly past you leaving you with only the bad parts, which is likely why there's a whole lot of people bashing the show. Please be aware of that if you're taking up this series!\\n\\n\r\nPS: I gave it a 7/10 because the 70% slice-of-life part was basically done right.",

            "content": "What\u2019s the best way to describe Kantai Collection? A series based on a browser game with cute fleet girls doing badass things? Or perhaps a series about military warfare with a taste of delicious curry? Regardless of how Kantai Collection should be, the series should be viewed forefront about fleet girls. In essence, Kantai Collection crafts its premise based on a set of characters in a fictional world with historical references. But unfortunately, this show runs like an engine with crude oil and it\u2019s not very impressive to say the least. \r\nIt\u2019s not always easy to adapt an anime based off a game. There arecertain set of principles to follow and not everyone will usually be satisfied to get what they want. Luckily, Kantai Collection is pretty straightforward with a rather non-linear storyline. That\u2019s right. The series may seem complicated with all these characters but the story itself is fairly simple. We follow the footsteps of Fubuki as she enlists herself as a naval destroyer at a naval base. With limited combat experience, she is assigned to the Third Torpedo Squadron. We also quickly learn that the series details events related to warfare pitting the fleet girls against a mysterious enemy known as the \u201cAbyss\u201d. Taken for granted, the series should feel less refreshing but more so to adapt with what it has to offer. Any fan of military fiction may feel at home with this premise.\\n\\n\r\nBut to start from the beginning, one should realize that the original source is a browser game made by developed by Kadokawa Games and hosted at DMM. With fairly simple gameplay mechanics and appeal, the series quickly gained popularity that now has over 2 million registered accounts in Japan. In fact, numerous adaptations of the game has been spawned that includes light novels, manga, and of course anime. So starting from here, one could say that taking on the footsteps of Fubuki is like becoming a new kid at school. The first day isn\u2019t easy as we quickly find out that she lacks military experience. This is evidenced by her lack of ability to glide on water as a fleet girl. Fortunately enough, she receives plenty of support from her friends and in no time becomes accustomed to fighting. The first few episodes show the general premise and style of the show. We are introduced to prominent characters such as Fubuki\u2019s friends \u2013 Mutsuki and Yudachi. Then, there are others from various squads including Kongou, Yayoi, Akatsuki with her Sixth Destroyer Division, Shimakaze, Akagi, Kaga, Nagato, among others. Then, there\u2019s also the mysterious admiral who operates behind the scenes to direct these girls to fight in war. Director Keizo Kusakawa puts his skills at work and to say the least, his resume doesn\u2019t look too impressive in terms of content. His most recent work includes directing another series from the Winter Season (Unlimited Fafnir) also with fictional war-like themes. The funny thing is that both of these shows are made of up a large female cast while his previous involvement follows a similar pattern. \\n\\n\r\nWar itself can be a hard word to swallow. What that means is that pain and death is inevitable. Kantai Collection is no exception when it comes to fleet girls being destroyed. Earlier on in the show, one of them is lost against the Abyss that strikes a painful scar in Fubuki\u2019s heart as she realizes the grim reality. And this shouldn\u2019t be a surprise either given the historical content. Anyone who is knowledgeable about historical reference should already be familiar with the context of the show and the ships. After all, the fleet girls are based off of these ships such as destroyers, carriers, battleships, light and heavy cruisers. In retrospect, Kantai Collection crafts elements of surprises on occasions when we realize that not everyone will survive the war for newer fans. \\n\\n\r\nA show like this also has an over-sized cast. It\u2019s noticeable that not everyone will get enough screen time. However, the show does present a lot of chemistry with the characters. The key word perhaps here is personality because every character in the show has one.  None of them behave like robots as part of some army. In fact, there are even feuds that builds up from little quirks with certain members of a squadron. On an individual basis though, each character portrays themselves on a unique scale. Take Fubuki for example. She comes off as a timid girl but builds confidence as the series progresses and fights alongside her friends. Kongou can be easily seen as the happy outgoing girl who has a heart of gold. Then, there\u2019s Akagi who seems to play an older sister type of character and role model for the younger fleet girls. With a variety of these personalities, you can familiarize yourself to see how they work with the show. Take for granted, each character is assigned with a role as well but teamwork always play a key part to a mission\u2019s success. While it is cleverly crafted, there are also some grim moments to heighten the awareness of the story. Unfortunately, the show also reassigns itself on many episodes with a slice of life tone. What weathers down the show is the balance of the pacing when we sometimes get episodes that just features \u2018cute fleet girls doing cute things\u2019. Part of that includes curry contests, beach episodes, and bath scenes. (which serves more purpose than just pure fan service) Combine that with some diehard comedy and you\u2019ll Kantai Collection served with unconventional fun. In retrospect, it\u2019ll take patience to adapt with shows like this and if the style isn\u2019t your type of thing, then satisfaction will not likely be guaranteed for you.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation can also be a mixed bag at first. The usage of CGI and modifications of the character designs serves as a pivotal factor to craft the basis of this series\u2019 artwork. There\u2019s a variety of characters so each of them must be well designed to fit with their personality. I can say with confidence that the character design did its job to portray the personalities and traits of each fleet girl. But the main course of the artwork comes with the action. The choreography has a charismatic thrill to it but only shines when you appreciate what it\u2019s trying to do. In general, the battles has high caliber amount of action with a genuine attempt to adapt the reality of war. However, be aware that the action itself will feel repetitive as every battle has more or less of the amphibian nature of naval warfare. To cap it off, there\u2019s also bits of fan service. What did you expect? The show is entirely made of female characters so a bit of skin here and there shouldn\u2019t be a surprise; even with some subtle yuri-undertone on occasions. Yes, I\u2019m looking at you Mochizuki.\\n\\n\r\nAs for soundtrack, it\u2019s mildly entertaining. The attractive OP and ED songs gives off a graceful feeling of energy. In particular, the ED theme song has tune that resembles a naval-like anthem for Fubuki and the others. But on a lesser appeal, the show\u2019s OST is hardly noticeable. The only time they truly shine is perhaps during emotional scenes and the action sequences. Their purpose is to draw out the attention that get the audience to feel how it\u2019s like being part of story. Unfortunately, this doesn\u2019t always work and in most cases can be easily forgotten.  Another main noticeable part is the voice mannerism. Each one of them must fit well to bring the fleet girls to life. I do give credit to that being adapted with efficiency in regards to the majority of the cast. In particular, Kongou brings lots of energy into the show with her hyper activeness and broken English. Yudachi and her signature \u201cPoi\u201d can also be noticeable too. The long story short version is that every character has a matching voice to meet their needs.\\n\\n\r\nThe roots of Kantai Collection may intimidating to realize but the show itself is actually more of mindless fun anime than anything else. Despite the amount of military context portrayed, there\u2019s a balance of slice of life indulged with the comedy of each episode. The large cast of characters will be hard to get used to and honestly, it should be painfully obvious to accept that not all of them will get enough screen time. To accept this show though, I think that keeping a keen interest in what it has to offer may be the best way to go. A problem can develop when the show\u2019s story squanders around and behaves wildly at times and then running like gentle air the next. Kantai Collection runs its engines to deliver fun entertainment so you\u2019ll have to accept it or not.",

            "content": "Kantai freaking Collection. How does it feel trying to find your best ship in the anime? How does it feel to be sucked in a world with moe anthropomorphic boat characters doing boat stuff? Well, I hope you managed to enjoy yourself watching the anime. However, there have been mixed opinions about this anime throughout and after its airing. Although many, whether they played the game or not, have actually enjoyed the anime, others are disappointed over the story\u2019s direction. Indeed, there are a number of flaws in the story which I feel that need to be addressed.\r\nFubuki is the protagonist of the anime whobrought herself to the naval district. There was not any clear goal she had until she tried out her first battle with her fleet that she wanted to be stronger and be with Akagi\u2019s fleet. Yes, this is all in the first episode of KanColle. From then on, we see not only the progress of Fubuki\u2019s goal but as well as a ton of ships interacting one another and living their normal lives in the naval district. But danger looms in these girls\u2019 eyes and they have to face their worst.\\n\\n\r\nFirstly, I feel that this anime is unfortunately not geared towards a group of audience who do not play the game. The anime contained humour mostly known for those who played game and knew more about the ships through many sources, whether official or not. To be honest, having watched the anime, I learnt a lot of such humour, and I was amazed by how the fans reacted to them through Twitter. I do not know if many who never played the game will understand the humour, but I think they will just pass it off. Speaking of humour, most of the time they are funny and cute. At least you are given some moe time in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe major problem of the anime is the lack of setting details. I know that there are two sides fighting each other, the Kanmusu and the Abyssal, but what are they fighting for? Land? Resources? What are Abyssal? The story basically lacked about what the girls are fighting against. Also, the timeline can be confusing. I think that the timeline is based on a modern year, however the fighting between the two sides are loosely based on the sea battles during World War II, which the Imperial Japanese Navy fought against the United States Navy. I really hoped the writers can expand this whole event in detail so it can be a lot more understanding. The anime has a lot of potential throughout then which blew all away.\\n\\n\r\nInconsistent pacing can be another problem in the story. Many complained for rushed scenes, especially towards the ending. Sometimes the battles felt rushed because something terrible happened, and things need to be taken cared of. Also, I do not really like how the composition plays within the story. At one moment, you see girls having a lot of fun, then later enemies fly past and a few them might have gotten themselves in trouble. The mood gets ruined and there is just too much emotions running at once.\\n\\n\r\nMany have tried predicting the story through major events in World War II, however the writers pretty much \u2018baited\u2019 a lot of people into seeing who dies in the anime. Many passed it off as a one-time thing, but another bunch think otherwise. Anyway, the whole World War II was just a loose adaptation. Strategic plans in the anime are okay, although the faults lie on the ships\u2019 decision.\\n\\n\r\nAdaptation-wise, I would say it did not work out well. However because of the limitations the game has, it cannot be helped but to break them. It\u2019s not really a big issue but it can certainly be frustrating for some people who watched the anime and tries the game afterwards only to know that they can\u2019t do certain functions.\\n\\n\r\nYou should know that Kantai Collection has a massive collection of ships that takes their names and abilities from past-time Japanese warships. Hence, the anime has a very huge cast of ships. Apart from Fubuki, there are focal characters as well from episode to episode. Of course, with a large cast, this means it is hard to know all the ships, especially for people who never played the game yet. I know most of them, which is a relief.\\n\\n\r\nFubuki, being the protagonist of the story, has a nice steady character development that managed to get the goal she wanted. Throughout her stay in the naval district, she learns a lot from various ships who support her into becoming strong. Despite being moody at times, as well as saving whoever\u2019s life on stake and getting herself in trouble instead, I think she is a nice character to watch. Indeed, she has grown stronger from start to end.\\n\\n\r\nNot much character development I see in all ships but Fubuki. Some of them drive Fubuki\u2019s development, while the rest are just for the character interactions. I feel that some of the characters should have a more detailed background story which probably make the story more interesting. Also, there are a very few characters that just show up for something without any depth.\\n\\n\r\nI have to be honest here but I really do not like the admiral (many fans call him teitoku) in this anime. He does not get a physical appearance and also his actions are just merely bad or confusing. It is just bland.\\n\\n\r\nBeing one of four Diomedea\u2019s anime that aired this season, budget can be a main concern. But looking at this anime, I must say that I am impressed by how it looks as compared to its other anime. But this does not mean the animation is outstanding. As per normal, there are nice sceneries to look at. I like to see how the sceneries matches the mood of the scenes, for example during most of the battles, there is a stormy atmosphere on top. The character designs follow mostly as how it looked like in the game, since the game have different designers working on different cards, at least this anime is standard. It is cool how they don their own equipments, although one can complain these equipments are too heavy for a girl.\\n\\n\r\nThe action scenes are awesome to look at. A lot of CGI is used in many action scenes and I think it is great since it gives the animations nice and smooth. However there are times when CGI should not be used, such as interactions of characters during battles. I like the visual effects that they made as well.\\n\\n\r\nI really love the opening and ending songs a lot and they are one of my favourite songs of this season. AKINO came back after AmaBuri\u2019s Extra Magic Hour with Miiro, a very energetic song which is great to rock at. A newcomer, Nishizawa Shiena, performs Fubuki which I find it really emotional to hear. At first I was not fond by hearing it but after a while, it just clicks to me. I shall be expecting more of her voice in the future!\\n\\n\r\nThe background music is okay, not too outstanding as well. I like some of the battle tracks that makes the battles more interesting to hear. Basically the background music has a wide variety of tracks from battle music, to slice of life music, to emotional music. Finally, I really want to give praise to all the voice actresses, especially Sakura Ayane and Touyama Nao, for voicing a lot of roles in the anime. The voice actress roles in the anime are as identical as the game, so there should not be any worry.\\n\\n\r\nSo, did Kantai Collection live up to my expectations? Not really, but I\u2019m just disappointed with the story as I wish it can get better at some point. Meaningless to say, I also enjoyed most of the anime, mostly being comedy and cute ships doing cute things. I have also been shipping quite a number of ships lately, and I know Ooi and Kitakami is one of the best shippings ever.\\n\\n\r\nA sequel was announced after the final episode ended, and I\u2019m not surprised to see that. It\u2019s obvious that Diomedea and Kadokawa wants to milk more money from us viewers. I really hope the sequel gets better. And certainly, with this season, there can just be more KanColle players in the game, so I really hope they are enjoying themselves.",

            "content": "Even taking into consideration the genre and source material this anime utilizes, this show in particular has been (upon reflection) one of the most over-hyped, predictable and bland products I've ever watched. Paper-thin plot, cardboard cut-out characters, and dialogue that made me cringe with embarrassment at what I was listening to. The game at least has the possibility of death which brings a weird quasi-darkness to it considering your cute \"waifu\" can end up at the bottom of the sea. Besides 2 supporting girls sinking so far, we've had nothing but predictable battles with hilariously bad CG effects, and SoL in-betweens with moe forced onyou so hard it kills the atmosphere and makes you wonder if there's actually a war going on. I know it's fucking moe yadda-yadda and is adapting the browser game to milk the fanbase even more with cuteness but sorry, knowing that DOES NOT excuse this show from being a bland and cliche' as fuck mess. SW and GuP share some of the same problems, but they're a bit more subdued and certainly smarter in the way they are handled so I like them quite a bit. I probably wouldn't be as mad if I wasn't greeted every episode with OP and ED sequences that try so god damn hard to be Epic. They could really add some meaningful drama if the girls had to cope with the fact that they couldn't escape the fates of their past namesakes... but no, we all know Fubuki is going save the day with friendship, break all the laws with love, and change history with compassion... This show had promise in the beginning to not just be another cliche' moe wank machine, but that is exactly what it turned into. It saddens me greatly to know that this kind of crap will almost certainly get a second season, wheras other more thought provoking shows, and even better moe shows, will fall to the wayside. I guess that's the anime world we live... it may be fruitless to try and fight it, but god dammit if I can save one other human soul from watching this junk then that's what I'll do. I won't be a mindless zombie attaching myself to this just because of the moe, hype, or bandwagon. For a better World War 2 themed military-moe, do yourself a favor and look up Strike Witches.",

Includes light spoilers, may or may not be properly done.\r\nKantai Collection is obviously, about the game of ship girls or fleet girls, whatever. It's enjoyable.\r\nAight, soooo let's start.\r\n========\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nThe story here is pretty much similar to some anime series out there. Things happen where MC was weak and then they get experience from the things they do blablabla. There's also the 'sudden problems that appear' trope I just made up for this review. The anime also contains some cheesy dramatic stuff on some parts which made me, uh, cringe a little. I wonder how I got pastsuch cringey drama when I watched (now to bring an unrelated anime here) Love Live back then. Damn, that show was great but the drama on some parts were, ugh. There's also the 'sudden rescue' trope I also just made up, in this show.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: Story is the same shiet you can get from OK shows, drama is kek.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nHere's where it gets real; The art is amazing, the water animation is so smooth, CG is great. I like the battle scenes in 3D. tbh the only show I've seen having CG shown for over 30 seconds is  Love Live. I like the art style here. The game art is, well, diverse (you may interpret this in a good or bad way, up to you :P).\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: Nice art style, CG, bla.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nAyy. Miiro is one of the best OPs I've heard this season. Along with Flyers from Death Parade. I like how they kept the VAs from the game. Also some sound effects. It's all good. I never wanted to listen to the ED though. topkek.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: Great sounds, voices, etc. yeah.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\r\nThose who don't play the game would probably hate this.\\n\\n\r\nNot much character development, understandable due to the large cast, and the time given for the show (1-cour). Hopefully S2 does better here.\\n\r\nAnyhow, the personalities of the characters from the game are retained (yay) and how they say the same stuff from the game too >Atago, Tama, etc. etc.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: Not enough character dev. But it's all good.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nI'd say I really liked this show despite some problems and how the system of the game is not similar. (I wish I could send multiple fleets to a mission at once :P). I believe the fanservice here is a-okay, could've been too much, but eh.  Plot is mediocre.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: It's good. LOL.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nYes it's an average. Here's the TL;DR of the whole review, including the TL;DRs for each section:\\n\\n\r\nIt's great, if you know the game. If you don't, it could be okay.\\n\r\nIt's enjoyable, to say the least. Could've been better. :D\\n\\n\r\n11/10 Would watch season 2. Needs more Shimakaze lolz.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nOverall: 41/50 = 82%\\n\\n\r\nAight, that's how I score stuff. Hopefully this review helps. :D\\n\\n\r\nwww\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Hooray! Kantai is finally over, and damn it is getting a second season! So here is a bird to Diomedea and DMM, for continuing to cash cow this work. Anyway a review on the show, Kantai is a cashgrab, made by money hungry fags for its fan base. It is not a anime you would watch unless you are a fan (or a moe zombie, in which case a bird to you too).\r\nFlame bait aside, time to get serious. There are two results when one adapt a game into an anime, one is when you create a watchable show by actually adapting, the other iswhen you create garbage by tossing in a bunch of references to the game. Here is the thing, most of the people who watch the show is not going to play the fricking game, when you make an anime you should be trying to appeal to the faction that isn't already in the fan-base. But who am I kidding, most anime writers are idiots anyway.\\n\\n\r\nstory - 3\\n\r\nShip Waifu wacky hijink, some people say it is something about girls being reincarnation of ships and etc. But don't be fooled, it is ship Waifu wacky hijinks. I don't care how many references you make to WWII, or how accurate some of the details are, it is all dressing, if the meat of the show is wacky hijinks with ship waifu, then the details means nothing. It is all just fanservice for military otakus, and boring details for anyone who isn't a military otaku. \\n\\n\r\nThe show try to have a couple serious moment, but let's be honest here, I'm not going to care that a cardboard cut out was sunk. You don't take the scenario serious from the start, neither will I, SHOCK FACTOR is a really cheap trick.\\n\\n\r\nEven the setting doesn't make much sense, but this was originally a browser game, so I'll let that pass. But I was still disappointed since I was expecting anthropomorphic ships, not girls with the souls of ships.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8\\n\r\nJarring CG transitions during some of the combat scene, even though the cg isn't utter shit, it looks like f**king MMD so much that I question whether they really used MMD to make those scenes. Everything else was decent.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7\\n\r\nTracks okay, not much to say.\\n\\n\r\ncharacter - 3\\n\r\nPOIPOIPOIPOIPOIPOIPOI, oh god I hate that sound. The characters are cardboard cutouts, and that is totally expected when you have so much character and so few episodes. A smart man would focus on a couple characters to flesh them out, but since Kantai exist only to rob the wallets of idiots who bought the BDs to see their ship Waifu, it shoves a bunch of them into the show. The result was that instead of characters, we have cardboard cutout with shiticks. And it gets insufferable, when you realize at the end of the day, you just want to see them all sunk, screw moe, I want a character not a bunch of cardboards.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 4\\n\r\nSome may ask, if you hate it why you watch it, the response would be, if you don't watch it you wouldn't know how to hate it and how it could have been better. Plus the major reason would be, to see how the current biggest doujin series turned out since it is a bit more popular than Touhou right now. Such a big doujin giant getting an official anime, I wanted to see how it would turn out, and god I am disappointed. When your anime is worse than your doujin manga, you know you f**ked up big time, in fact it made me doubt Kantai even deserve to have so many doujin artists, since a lot of Touhou artists jumped ship (pun intended) to try to flesh out Kantai. It is really disappointing to see that the actual people who made the thing cared so little about the show, turning it into a soulless cash-grab.\\n\\n\r\nWe could have gotten a emotional story about anthropomorphic ships in a war, with losses and philosophy, showing the cruelty of war while referencing WWII. But instead we got, fricking cute girls doing cute things #ILostCount with ship references throw in. So once again, screw you Modern Anime, this is why we can't have good things.",

            "content": "KanColle has an even dumber concept than Strike Witches. As if pantsless lolis with boot propellers wasn't stupid enough, here we have Fleet Girls\u2122 which are basically qt 3.14s with assorted ship apparatuses that magically summon from the ethos (or variously must be equipped) and transform the grills into some vague reference to WW2 Japanese ships while they maintain their qt-ness. \r\nAnd yet it works. It works really well.\r\nEach ship (or grill) has a distinct personality. Some, like the Yamato, are hilariously tied to the IRL circumstances of their namesakes, but others are just...silly. We have lesbian ship sisters, the boisterous Kongo quartet, wizened fleetcarriers, and naturally there are loli torpedo boats with the gamut of anime tropes. Fubuki is the star of the series, a Fleet Grill\u2122 who starts as a clumsy good-for-nothing but grows into a hero who saves everyone (not really a spoiler, since this is an anime and that happens in literally every single anime ever).\\n\\n\r\nAll that's fine, but it's the details that made KanColle so good for me. The carriers use bows to fire arrows that poof into planes piloted by doll things (???), destroyers fire groups of torpedoes from their legs like some caricature of a boy doing the humping motion, and battleships make a grand gesture of giving the enemy a full salvo. The ship/grills heal from damage by soaking in a hot spring, when a ship is ready to be refitted they start glowing, the carriers and battleships eat about 400 tons of food per day. Even the seaplane tender girls have fantastic details with their setups. The best part is that it's presented with a nod for magic realism: nothing is explained, it just *is* and that's that. I know this is based on some vidya, and that's super obvious, but even though I haven't played said vidya I still appreciated the entire package.\\n\\n\r\nI know I'm a sucker for all things naval (except the soul-draining leech that is WoWS....ugh) and that definitely predisposed me to enjoy this, but I absolutely recommend KanColle for anyone searching out a great time.",

            "content": "I really wanted to like this show. I really did. Being the fan of Kancolle I am,\r\nI just cannot hate it completely, but this show was a disappointment.\r\nIt is a huge potential wasted, thus a frustration to those familiar with he game and fandom.\r\n-What potential?\r\nKancolle is a browser game that came out in 2013. It gained popularity far beyond the expected level, so much that the servers can't handle the demand and new players are allowed into the game via a lottery system, japanese and non-japanese alike.\r\nWhat made the game this popular, was the doujin market around it.\r\nThe game had a vast amount of characters,interestingcharacter art, very good voice acting and music. The effort (and love) put into it was beyond the level of what one would expect from a free to play browser game. Thus, soon the fandom started expanding beyond the game. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters were given unofficial traits based on their lines or behaviour in the game, -Akagi having a huge apetite due to consuming high amounts of resources in the game, Nagato being into cute things, Murakumo becoming the badass for no reason I know of- theories were built around the enemies -such as them being the malice of war,sunken vessels, zombie ships so to say- which gave birth to many comics that are unique in their own way, fun or serious, action-packed or laidback. \\n\\n\r\nThe reason Kancolle keeps getting compared to Touhou isn't simply because its doujin market caught up to it in numbers, but because the way both their fanworks are: They hugely expand the concepts of the source they are feeding from. \\n\\n\r\nKancolle as a game, does not have a story. It also does not need one.\\n\r\nBut when you're making a show, a scenario is needed. What the writers had to do was to do a throught research on the fanworks, and realize what Kancolle had been made into by the majority. But they failed this task.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-Characters: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nEven this score may be biased because I simply cannot unlearn what I have from the fandom. But the anime does a terrible job on the characters. First of all, they tried to\\n\r\ninclude too many charcters into a very short airing time. There is a \"let's show as many characters as we can so that we please every fan out there\" mentality going on. Yes, I said every \"fan\" out there. Because if you are not familiar with the character already, it's not possible to actually get attached to any of them. The reason for this is the ridiculously short screen time supporting everyone but Fubuki (MC) gets, and their dialouges mostly consisting of their lines from the game. So to anybody who is not already familiar with them, what the characters say, the way they think and react will make little to no sense. Even for those who know, portrayal of the characters are super weak.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-Story: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nAh, yes, the story. The first 3 episodes had one going, so I give one point for each. After that, it just becomes a mess of events. It feels like the studio gathered 12 people for each of the episodes, then they had a meeting on the basic storyline. \"Alright gentlemen, we are going to start from point A, then stop by B, and conclude with C.\"\\n\r\nThen, eveybody starts writing their own episode without knowing what the person before them wrote in their script. After the first 3 episodes we just have a major battle that keeps being postponed without seeing any real preperations for it, events that literally cancel each other out,(To keep it spoiler free,think of a character painting a wall blue for 3 episodes, then \\n\r\npainting it red for next 2), things just coming out of the blue and even a filler that doesn't even manage to fill anything. And then a VERY anti-climatic ending. Yeah, even if you were to collect random doujin plots and brought them together, it would probably make this much sense, if not more.\\n\\n\r\n-Art: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nDespite the 3d CGI, the rest of the show was pretty good I think. And 3D CGI looking bad isn't a problem unique to this series, I've yet to see 3D that doesn't stick out except Rebuild of Evangelion series. While the models look like slightly advanced MMD models, the animating of them were pretty good I think. The battle scenes were quite dynamic and in a series like this where combat is a major part, unfortunately this is inevitable. Other than the 3dCGI, everything was decent and enjoyable. We had very nice backgrounds, distinct changes in atmoshpere between different places of the Naval District. I enjoyed both the battlefield and recreation facilites. Character art was also pretty good, I think they handles Mutsuki's gradient hair pretty well.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-Sound: 11/10\\n\\n\r\nYes,if there's one part of the series that is perfect,it's the sound department. Both the voice actors and OST. Looking at the seiyuu list, you might think the developers were tight on budget, but this is a brilliant \"tech demo\" of the voice actors. Many charcaters are voiced by the same people, yet it's not noticable in the slightest. I watched a scene where 4 charcters talked to eachother, and was shocked to find out it was literally one person talking behind the scenes. My respects to each VA taking part in this show, that's incredible. I mean, being able to change their tone might be a crucial ability for the VAs, but it's impressive to be exposed to it in a single show and a single episode. The OST does a real good job too, was kinda disappointed that the show didn't have any OST from the game at first, but now I am glad it added to the already wonderful soundtrack of the franchise. Opening and ending are great as well.\\n\\n\r\nMight be a disappointment in terms of a show overall, but I nominate it for the best OST of the year already, as there aren't many anime that manage to stand out in this context.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-Overall: 4-6/10\\n\r\n-If you are a regular person simply looking for a new anime to watch, unfortunately I cannot recommend it. 4/10\\n\r\n-If you are a person who wants to get into Kancolle, this is definately not the point to start. stayaway/10 \\n\r\n-If you are a fan of Kancolle, it's likely you will enjoy it more than regular peeps, but cringe at the potential it's wasting. 6/10\\n\r\n-If you are a fan of military stuff, give it a try I say. You're here for torpedoes and planes anyway, and you will get it. 7/10",

            "content": "Ever wondered why Touhou doesn't have an anime? This is why.\r\nThere are two perspectives you can watch this show from: Either you played the game, or you haven't. This show is clearly designed to appeal to the former, and does a great job at failing in everything because of that. The thing about making an animated series of something like Kancolle is  that, aside from having the fans seeing their favorite characters being animated, it also gives a chance for them to see the characters develop beyond their limited personality trait in the game. \r\nWhat happens in this 12-episode odyssey is the complete oppositeof that idea.\\n\\n\r\nBefore going any further into this series' embarrassing writing that makes Boku no Pico Shakespearean in comparison, there are several other notable aspects of this show that warrant mentioning: Music, for the most part, is pretty decent. Apparently there seems to be an unspoken rule that terrible shows must have a decent/good soundtrack. Though, having claimed that, it's actually pretty difficult to hear most of the soundtrack because the battle scenes barely last more than a single minute. And yes, I'm being pretty lenient with the term \"battle scenes\" because the visuals are legitimately worse than something from a Toei show. It's not even like YYY where 3DCG scenes were hardly noticeable- It's just literally everywhere in every battle scene in this show, and they're all so incredibly poorly choreographed that it makes you wonder whether a properly functioning human being was responsible for them. \\n\\n\r\n-Spoilers below-\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned previously, this show is something that tries too hard to appeal to the existing fanbase with the smallest effort possible that it fails at its job completely- First, the characters. There are way too fucking many. How did Diomedea manage to include all these 50+ characters in this 12-episode show? The answer is, they didn't. None of them end up being actual characters, and all they get for lines is repetition of the same throwaway line they babble in the game ad infinitum. See, this is the difference between a game and an animated series that tells a story- In games like Kancolle, it's pretty difficult to actually express characters' personality aside from their throwaway lines, so to keep the game interesting, more characters are added to compensate for the lack of further development from the existing characters. But when you're trying to tell a story, that no longer applies- The more characters there are, the harder it is to focus on a certain character(s), and thus, it makes them as bland as they would be in the game when the point of telling a story is the complete opposite: Developing them beyond what would've been feasible in a simple click-and-win game.  \\n\\n\r\nThese characters' gimmicks are also influenced by the fanon- Such as Akagi being a big eater in the show due to her consuming lots of resources in-game. Completely necessary addition, I'm sure. Fubuki, the MC, is incredibly boring and breaks personality several times in-series just to create unnecessary drama, which makes you wonder why the Admiral favors this particular character in the first place outside of her status as the main character. Everyone else can be summed up with a single sentence: Shimakaze likes going fast. Kongou likes speaking in broken English. Hibiki says one Russian word every chance she gets. Yuudaichi likes -poi more than -desu. Sendai really loves night battles. Naka won't shut the fuck up. Calling these protagonists cardboard cutouts would be an insult to cardboard cutouts from Akame ga Kill, so I'm not sure what to call them. \\n\\n\r\nWhat about the antagonists, though? If you expected anything other than \"incompetent mute cyborg zombies,\" then god damn is this show happy to disappoint. I'm not sure what the trend is with all these silent villains that have no real motives, but I guess writing any form of conflict outside of badly animated/choreographed battle scenes was beyond Diomedea's capability. And if that wasn't enough, the Abyssals are pretty pathetic at their job and manage to be as threatening as moving dartboards. I guess they manage to finally sink a character who had a total screen time of less than a minute, who happens to be a friend of a boring friend of the boring MC with a last-second sneak attack. Oh, the horror. It's especially hilarious when the show cuts to Abyssals looking ominous and evil with spooky music playing in the background when they're a complete non-threat.\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally, the Admiral. It's pretty obvious that this Admiral character was designed to represent the viewer/player, which is why this character is never truly shown on the screen. Therefore, the character's motives/personality/appearance are all completely unknown because it's supposed to be \u201cyou.\u201d I'm not sure why this is even necessary considering this character plays a very little role, but apparently it was- Which is why Diomedea decides to fuck that up too by giving this character an identity. Apparently the reason why the Admiral favors Fubuki (the boring MC) so much is that he has a boner for this character. Well, that's great. Now everyone knows that the Admiral is this guy who has a boner for Fubuki, who is the most boring character in a show full of characters solely identified by throwaway lines. What happened to ambiguity, again? Honestly, Wo-class is a much better representation of the viewer- Looking bored and stoned as fuck throughout the entire fucking show pretty much sums up my experience. \\n\\n\r\nAside from the poorly written characters with no effort put into them, there are two other things Diomedea decided to do to \u201cappeal\u201d to the existing fanbase of this series. One is tying in in-game mechanics like repair docks, buckets, upgrades, and etc. Not exactly necessary or hindering, but I'd think that alone should have been enough for references from the game instead of making every character what they are in this show. The second thing is \"historical reenactment\"- Since all the characters are based off of real life ships, the idea is that they would meet the same fate at the same time at the same place. This is sort of \"foreshadowed\" in the opening sequence where you can briefly see the real Akagi ship sinking and is a \u201cmajor\u201d plot point in the latter part of the series. I'm not exactly sure how this is supposed to be an appeal, however. Knowing what's going to happen in the show based on real life events seems completely uninteresting especially considering the flat characters and setting, and if it was any more focused by the series, it would just be yet another cliche'd \"fighting against fate\" plot line that's been done million times over, so I really don't get it. I guess it makes some people feel smug for knowing that this one character that may have been in the background in one episode will sink before other people do.\\n\\n\r\nSo outside of Diomedea's blatantly embarrassing fanservice, what else is there? I guess there's supposed to be a plot somewhere, but the pacing is so horrendous that it's actually difficult to remember what actually happened in this show. That being said, this show does few things that could be considered two of the worst things one can do when writing a story. The first is lack of focus- Just like several other shows, this show cannot decide what kind of a show it wants to be. It could be either a fun show about wacky hijinx, or a serious show with drama that may or may not be forced. If it stuck with one, and did just that, then it would have been fine. Unfortunately, Kancolle attempts to do both, and fails at both- I'm not sure why so many shows do this when both drama and comedy hinder each other most of the time, thus making their simultaaneous inclusion counter productive. I'd assume it probably sounded good on that used toilet paper they used for the storyboard for this show. The amount of sudden mood shifts in this show is transcendent, and this is made even worse with piss-poor pacing. For example, there would be a forced drama scene with Fubuki and her friends. Then it would immediately cut to Ooi and Kitakami doing their usual comedy routine. Then immediately cut back to the drama scene. Flawless.\\n\\n\r\nThe second problem ties into the first- Even the drama is completely forced. And even then, these supposedly sad scenes aren't even relevant or impactful. Because by the end of the episode, it turns out everything was fine all along, which makes the characters seem idiotic for worrying about it in the first place. This problem is especially notable with Fubuki breaking character and doing something reckless against the enemy because suddenly she decided that she wanted to feel important and have a personality. She obviously fails at everything noted above, but this scene itself has also failed at having any lasting impact. No one ends up getting hurt in the end, and everything was daijobu. Then she goes to train with moving targets, which really are as threatening as Abyssals considering how much damage Fubuki came out of it in the end. What a joke. \\n\\n\r\nBut wait, there's more. In the last episode, where everything seems \"hopeless\" because that one mean Abyssal just won't die despite it being only able to shoot out nearly harmless white balls in the protagonists' general direction as its masterful strategy, Nagato suddenly shows up to the rescue- It was all according to plan, apparently. Then when it doesn't work, a new shipgirl appears out of nowhere that got a brief \"foreshadowing\" (using this term extremely loosely) in the previous episode and comes to save the day- Then the Admiral literally uses repair buckets out of nowhere to get more shipgirls in the battle, and the show doesn't even try to hide its Deus ex Machina garbage writing at this point. Then Black Rock Shooter and Fubuki stare at each other before the former realizes this writing is fucking retarded and goes back down the ocean. \\n\\n\r\nBasically, every single episode in this show can be summed down to this: 20 minutes of filler that may or may not include poorly written drama that ends up resolving itself the same god damn episode, and 2 minutes of poorly choreographed battle scene where victory is solely decided by shooting at things a lot with no strategy involved. \\n\\n\r\nIt's incredibly ironic that this show tried so hard to appeal to the existing fanbase that it only alienated them as a result, and ended up appealing to an entirely different group of people who watches shows based on anything but quality. Now, I think it's pretty notable to mention that some people seem to defend this show with claims like \"What did you expect?\" But that sort of claim would only be valid if someone criticized something like Hamtaro for its lack of drama. It's completely invalid here because it doesn't do either drama or comedy because it tries to do both and fails at both. Most criticisms for this show do not come from complaining about what this show doesn't have- It comes from what this show does have and that is fucking awful. Some might also claim \"It's a game advertisement show so it obviously wouldn't be good!\" What about Rage of Bahamut: Genesis? That was a show based on a Mobage, and it was one of the best shows of its season, so that excuse isn't valid either. Any show, no matter what it's based on or which studio's doing it, can have actual effort put into it, and that alone would make any show significantly better than this garbage. The fact is, this show is just a lazy, half-assed attempt to make money off a popular franchise while putting as little effort as possible. And just to emphasize on the point of \"striking while the iron is hot,\" a second season is immediately announced by the end of the last episode. Subtle.\\n\\n\r\nThe best way to describe Kancolle would be that it's basically anti-Touhou. It's everything that Touhou isn't- Kadokawa also apparently decided that it didn't want to put any effort into their \u201cgame,\u201d so they decided to forbid any Kancolle doujin game whatsoever because having to make anything that's more than a clicking simulator would be far beyond their talents. And then they get this show made just to make sure they can rake in as much money as possible before the popularity wears off. Considering how this show turned out, and how many of its existing fans reacted to it, I think it's pretty safe to say that ZUN made the proper decision. And I think it's pretty worrisome if all this makes a drunken man who can't even get human anatomy correct after nearly a decade seem like Albert fucking Einstein.",

            "content": "You know what's great? Cute girls. You know what's even better? Playing a game filled with them. Even better? The fact that they all have good artists and VAs. The best part? The diversity of girls makes it so anyone can find a favorite. You'd think it wouldn't be difficult to make a Kancolle anime considering there are anime with similar kinds of situations such as Strike Witches and Girls und Panzer, but instead of having a healthy balance of slice of life and battles, Kancolle just jumps around everywhere, making for a jarring experience.\r\nThe story is heavily divided, with multiple parts with their ownplot. The parts are segmented into episodes 1-4, 5+7, 6 , 8-9, and 10-12. It winds up being all over the place, tending to be a repeating pattern of slice of life, preparations for sortie, sortie, miracle, and end sortie. Kancolle also tends to tunnel vision on whatever the current episode's plot is and forces the issue. The only overarching drive in Kancolle is Fubuki striving to become one of Akagi's escorts. Honestly, it's how the slice of life elements and combat elements are thrown into the pot together that really inhibit the anime as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nFortunately, the lead designer is great. He really brings to life the ships of so many different artists in one cohesive style. The best part is that the faces are drawn similarly enough to where you can look at both the anime and game styles and see how they correlate. The music is also solid and features a wonderful op and ed. The battle music doesn't quite pack a punch, but still fits thematically.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest issue with the Kancolle anime is how the characters are handled. For some reason the writers decided that having all of the characters keep saying in game lines and slightly modified versions of in game lines was a good idea when it actually destroyed life from the characters. Look, I understand that the lines were probably put in because they wanted an easy way to convey the character's personalities, but it's possible to do it without resorting to such an uninspired method. I don't want to continually hear Hibiki's Russian one liners all the time. I want her to speak full sentences, and if Russian words want to be added in at that point, that's fine. Also, the fact that the admiral is never seen and never talks bothers me a lot. It just makes it feel like it's that way for self-inserting purposes, which just saps any joy from interactions with the admiral.\\n\\n\r\nEven with all of its problems, I did enjoy watching Kancolle; however, I wouldn't recommend it to everyone. It is definitely something that you have to enjoy from the start, otherwise you would just be bored. If anything, episode 6 was the most consistent episode thematically and consequently the most enjoyable. As someone who has loved playing the game for almost a year and counting, this was definitely a disappointing experience. If you are curious about the anime, give it a shot, as you might enjoy it still.",

            "content": "Kantai Collection: KanColle is an Action, Comedy, Slice of life, Military, Sci-fi anime based of the web browser game created by Kadokawa Games. The anime was created by Diomed\u00e9a Studio and was aired on January 8, 2015 to March 26, 2015 and lasting for 12 episodes. \r\nPlot\r\nThe plot follows Special Type Destroyer Fubuki, a young girl who is a Kanmusu, girls who possess a spirit of a naval vessel within themselves and use these spirits to fight the Abyssal fleet who are threatening humanity from the sea. These girls live at naval bases, where they are taught to fight the Abyssal. Fubuki is a newrecruit at one of these naval bases upon her arrival she joins the Third Torpedo Squadron and is sent into battle despite having very limited combat training. While in battle, she is saved by Akagi, An Aircraft Carrier, and afterwards Fubuki decides that she needs to become stronger so she can fight at Akagi\u2019s side.\\n\r\nThe Show does a good job of explaining its story to the viewer by explaining the different kinds of Kanmusu and what the job in the fleet are. While the fighting is keep at a minimal, the focus of the show is based on Fubuki and her comrades while they train at the naval base which is interesting and funny at the same time. Now, because of the anime having so many character and character building, I going to only give the names of girls and what type of Kanmusu they are:\\n\r\nFubuki, Voiced by Sumire Uesaka \u2013 Special Type Destroyer, a part of the Third Torpedo Squadron\\n\r\nMutsuki, Voiced by Rina Hidaka \u2013 Destroyer, a part of the Third Torpedo Squadron \\n\r\nY\u016bdachi, Voiced by Yumi Tanibe \u2013 Destroyer, a part of the Third Torpedo Squadron \\n\r\nSendai, Jints\u016b and Naka, Voiced by Ayane Sakura \u2013 Light Cruisers, a part of the Third Torpedo Squadron with Jints\u016b as Flagship.\\n\r\nAkagi, Voiced by Saki Fujita \u2013 Aircraft carrier, a part of the First Carrier Division\\n\r\nKong\u014d, Hiei, Haruna and Kirishima, Voiced by Nao T\u014dyama \u2013 Battleships, a part of the Second Fleet\\n\r\nNagato and Mutsu, Voiced by Ayane Sakura \u2013 Battleships, Secretaries of the fleet.\\n\r\nKitakami and \u014ci, Voiced by Yuka \u014ctsubo \u2013 Torpedo Cruisers\\n\\n\r\nPresentation\\n\r\nKanColle art style uses a bright blend of colors to breathe life into the show for the viewer. Each of the characters have been given a unique personality, making them stand out compared to one another and easily recognizable to the viewer. The show uses two different animation styles: one for the action scenes and the characters every day life. The use of a different style for the action scenes helps making them more beautiful and interesting to the viewer, thus making them some of the best parts of the show. The voice acting in this is very impressive because of some voice actresses doing multiple characters especially Ayane Sakura, as some of her characters have conversations with each other and the viewer is able to tell which character is talking by their voice. \\n\\n\\n\r\nMy Opinion \\n\r\nKanColle is an anime where I did not know much about before watching, that has made me interested in the Kantai Collection game series. The story, while it not one of the best I've seen was still enjoyable. The characters have been designed with a lot of care in terms of looks and personality, and because of this care the art style over all was appealing to me. The message I got from KanColle is that as long you keep trying your hardest, you can achieve anything you put your mind and heart to. Finally, I love the character development of Fubuki over the course of the show as she always tries her best and doesn't give up. \\n\\n\r\nVerdict \\n\r\nKanColle is one of the anime that while looking at each part separately, like basic story or characters, is nothing special; however, when combined together makes a very interesting show. Anyone, both fans of Kantai Collection or newcomers, can enjoy its characters, art style and story. While there is better stories out there, I still recommend people to give KanColle a go as it takes a common idea and makes it something unique and new to people watching.",

            "content": "Finally, we get to see our shipfus animated.\r\nKantai Collection, or kancolle, is a browser game on DMM where you play as an admiral in charge of a number of ship girls based on WWII ships. You send the ships on sorties and expeditions in your campaign against the abyssals who has taken over Earth's ocean, all while praying to RNGesus that your construction or sortie reward yields the ship you want. Its a nice timesink and appeals a lot to its target audience, with a strong fanbase that rivals that of Touhou. With such a large and dedicated fanbase, its extremely tempting to create ananime adaptation to not only provide fanservice, but to also make a quick buck on its popularity. So they yielded and produced this anime. And how does it fare?\\n\\n\r\nCondensed version:\\n\r\nWhy you may pick this up:\\n\r\n-Plenty of fanservice (ero and non-ero) for those who have played the game\\n\r\n-Poi\\n\r\n-Kongou\\n\r\n-Shimakaze\\n\r\n-Nagamon\\n\r\n-Ship waifus are now animated\\n\r\n-OP and ED (though to be fair, if you only want the OP and ED you can just search on YT or hikari no  akari)\\n\\n\r\nWhy you may skip this:\\n\r\n-Anime does a poor job of introducing game to newcomers or to people who never played kancolle.\\n\r\n-Newcomers and people who never played kancolle will not get the references and fanservice\\n\r\n-Poor plot direction and pacing\\n\r\n-Insufferable CG\\n\\n\r\nLong version: \\n\r\nStory-5: This is the weakest part of the anime. The story is best described as going through an existential crisis; it does not know its purpose for existing. Does it want to tell a gripping tale about a young maiden's perilous journey through Earth's Ocean with her fellow shipgirls, or does it want to be a Madoka clone, or a SOL comedy, or to introduce newcomers to the game, or to provide fanservice for current players? It has the distinction of being all of the above, and yet somehow being none of the above at the same time. It constantly switches between those identities, like at one point the anime is trying to push the fact that a shipgirl has sunk, and at the next the Akatsuki sisters are entering a curry competition, as if that sinking never happened. It should pick an identity and stick to it. We would have been fine with the anime if all 12 episodes were just the shipgirls seating around the Teitoku's office drinking tea and eating cake, and maybe have cameos from the abyssals as well. They may as well call themselves Headquarters Tea-Time.  It\u2019s simple, cheap, fun, provides fanservice for current players, while having many opportunities to introduce the game to newcomers.\\n\\n\r\nArt-7: The art is decent during the non-combat scenes. The managed to make most of the shipgirls look moe enough to keep you going. Artillery designs are all based on art from the game and WWII ships, while all the girls themselves look cute enough, unlike some of their in-game counterparts. The main problem is the CG used during the combat scenes, or when they are water skating. It is extremely jarring to watch. The framerate does not make the animation smooth, and this makes the combat scenes very hard to digest, which in turn, makes admiring the shipgirls difficult. The Character designs somehow gets downgraded as they move in a 3D plane, and ruins the entire experience. Fortunately, these scenes are not prolonged, and we quickly return to the moe 2D girls.\\n\\n\r\nSound-8: One reason you may pick up this anime. Both OP and ED are enjoyable, and the ED is one of my personal favourite ED. The soundtrack used are enjoyable to hear when used during the scene is meant for, but are ultimately forgettable. Artillery firing packs a nice explosive punch to them, and all the VAs do their jobs well enough. The VAs in this anime deserve special mention, as they actually voiced multiple ship sisters, each with their own distinct pitch and tone you could\u2019ve sworn were completely different voice actors. Honorable mention goes to Nao Touyama, who voiced the Kongou sisters, Atago and Takao. Her voices can be extremely different from each other, from Kongou\u2019s  Engrish to Atago\u2019s playfulness, and yet she manages to do make all 6 characters sound like they have 6 different VAs.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters-8: Probably the main reason one might pick up this anime. Fans of the game should ALL have a ship they are extremely fond of, and Kadokawa has recognised this, even giving players the ability to marry the ships that they like. To see them animated, with their VAs saying new unique lines and interacting with other shipgirls, is like a wet dream come true to the player base. The story follows Fubuki, one of the special-class destroyers and a starter ship in the game, as she joins fellow destroyers Yuudachi (poi) and Mutsuki in taking the Ocean back for humanity, one abyssal at a time. The character development in this show suffers because of this, as these three are the only characters that receive any development, the rest being there to provide the viewers a chance to see their shipfus animated. While the other characters are lively and fun to watch on screen, they receive little to no character development. Backstories are left in history books since these shipgirls' history are based on their WWII counterparts, like Sendai's love for night battles since she fought most of her battles at night in WWII, or how Yamato's aversion to the word 'hotel' is based on her being used mostly as a hotel in WWII and barely used for combat. Enjoyable, but unless you have played the game, they are not memorable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-8: As a huge fan of the game, my enjoyment of this anime is, of course, biased, since I understand all the jokes, fanservice, and references made in this anime. To see the shipgirls that I often used in the game animated is glorious eye candy, but was shattered when they transitioned to the CG. I also found that I enjoyed the SoL moments more that the action ones. Just 2 episodes of them making curry and looking for Shimakaze are better than 10 episodes of them fighting the abyssals.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-7: If you are a fan of the game the anime is based on, feel free to watch this. While the CG is painful to watch, one can get over it through the love for their shipfus. For newcomers who wants to know more about the kancolle craze or wants to know more about the game, the English Kancolle wiki the kancolle forums, Himeuta, has FAQs and general information about the game. IF you are a newcomer, play the game and fall in love with the game or a shipfu first before watching, or else most of the jokes, references and cameos will lose its appeal. For people not interested in Kancolle but is a huge anime fan, do not bother with this. A poor story focus and lack of character development in a large cast of characters brings down the anime, with an ending not worth your time. If you want to investigate what the kancolle craze is about, himeuta or the kancolle wiki is more than enough. If not, you are better off spending your precious time watching other anime.\\n",

            "content": "I feel compelled to write a review about this show since it was one of those shows that was fairly hyped during this season and has a unusually high average score for a show this mediocre. As a fan of the game and the general media craze of Kancolle, this show as a whole falls short of being good from any perspective.\r\nFirstly, I'd like to note that unlike a lot of people who like to rate similar to how IGN likes to rate things (i.e. anything below a 7-8 is \"meh\"), and because of it, I generally dislike number ratings, especially ones as bloated asa 1-10 scale, but I will follow the guidelines and base my \"average\" at a 5/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nSpoilers ahead.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nThe premise of the show is the same as the game: some alien beings called Abyssal (a.k.a American forces) have invaded the waters near Japan and conventional weaponry does not work on them, so they do the next best thing: get adolescent girls to bond with the spirit of old Japanese warships, adopting their names in order to fight this new enemy. The fleet are stationed at a naval base where the admiral (who doesn't make an appearance, but is implied that you, the audience, is the admiral) helps shape them into the war machines they need to be. The premise is over the top and makes the show impossible to take seriously, which is the point. It's meant to tease the WW2 and moeblob demographics and provide a general 23~ minutes of pandering each week, which is fine, I enjoyed Strike Witches for doing practically the same thing.\\n\\n\r\nWhere Kancolle differs, and suffers because of it, from Strike Witches, is that the show can't decide if it wants to go full-out fanservice mode and pander to the viewers or make a show with genuine hype and passable writing. A show can do both, but Kantai Collection is not one of those shows. The story starts off giving a really good showcase of the show, with nice action scenes, introductions to the popular ship girls of the game, with some delivering their one-liners and real-life-ship-mirroring personalities, but it never moves forward from that point. From one episode to the next, they keep introducing new ships, sometimes to introduce a new story arc, but most of the time it's just to have them there to cater to anyone who is a fan of that ship.\\n\\n\r\nThere was a moment in one of the earlier episodes where they \"re-enact\" the Battle of Wake Island, which is the battle where the Kisaragi gets scuttled. The episodes ends rather dramatically, building up tension going into the next episode, maybe giving the show a sense of tension and direction, only to have the next episode be a showcase of Kongou and Shimakaze's shenanigans. It was incredibly jarring going from what could have been a moderately emotional story development to a 4-koma esque episode catering to fans of Kongou and Shimakaze, and then going back to conclude Mutsuki's and Kisaragi's arc at the end of that same episode. To put it simply, there were a lot of ideas thrown around in those 2 episodes, but no direction to coherently deliver it.\\n\\n\r\nAfter that point, the show switches into slice-of-life mode, where, you guessed it, they keep introducing more ship girls for one-off arcs that provides very little to any semblance of a story.\\n\\n\r\nThe last third of the show goes back to being a bit more dramatic with the Battle of Midway, the famous battle in which Japan suffered a major loss in the Pacific theatre, and was the battle where one of show's more prominent characters, Akagi, gets sunken. I will say the sinking of Kisaragi did do a good job of baiting the audience into thinking they aren't afraid to stick to historical accuracy, and the episodes leading up to Operation MI did foreshadow Akagi's death, but in true anime fashion, the entire cast comes in to save the day. The final episode also had this theme of \"defying fate\" which basically translates into \"changing real-life history\", but the way it was delivered makes the writers of the show come off as being a little salty about WW2, with a little pinch of nationalism.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: Story is basically Strike Witches but on water instead of air, but with no actual direction and execution, and any sort of potential that the story did have was wasted to pander to fans of the game (which did not work).\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe show started off strong. Like, really strong. In the first episode, when the girls deploy for the first time, we're treated to a rather eye-catching magical girl-esque transformation sequence as they equip their guns and armor. This is a good example of CGI being used moderately well. However, the art quality goes south rather quickly.\\n\\n\r\nThe show mixes the use of 2D drawn and 3D CGI for normal, day to day scenes, and high-movement battle scenes, respectively. The problem comes in when there's any sort of dialogue during the latter scenes. The scenes like to cut from 2D to CGI and back for very little reason, even when there's no actual, high-budget action going on. It becomes even more jarring when there are visual inaccuracies swapping between the two types of animation within the same scene.\\n\\n\r\nBy the end of the show, the budget was obviously running dry with shots like (https://38.media.tumblr.com/5d0dfa0739f4f665b7f76faf19446530/tumblr_nlt5vtpQg11r3fop8o1_500.gif) where assets pop in (and aren't composed properly, as you can tell from the gun barrels cutting off near the edge of the screen after popping in) or shots like this (http://i.4cdn.org/a/1427391382586.jpg) where apparently the girls have 6 fingers on each hand.\\n\\n\r\nThere's also the point that many of the characters suffer from same-face syndrome, and as a result, look nothing like their game-art renditions.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR - Art budget was used mostly in the opening episodes and the girls all look the same, unlike the source game.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending themes were rather enjoyable to listen to and the cast is the same as game, which is a really high point of praise considering the skill of some of the seiyuus. I think one seiyuu voiced 6-7 characters in this show, none of which sound the same, and a few of which interact with each other in the same scenes. It's also a nice touch that the characters have lines directly or draw from their lines in the game.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/10\\n\r\nSpeaking of characters drawing their lines from the game, that's pretty much 90% of the characters outside of the 3-4 main characters. One of the more popular ship girls, Kongou, pretty much serves as a mouthpiece for pandering. Her entire presence can be boiled down to \"Hey, look at me! Look at how historically accurate I am! Look at me deliver the same quotes as in the game every time I'm on screen! Buurniing loooove~~~!!!\".\\n\\n\r\nAs far as development goes, none of the characters actually grow, except for maybe Fubuki, the main character, and even then it takes a horrendously awkward development arc, and it never made care about her throughout the show (apparently, she was chosen to be a part of the admiral's fleet because he had a dream about her in a wedding dress? I get that marrying a ship girl is a part of the game, but did they really have to make a plot point?). And with the supporting cast being so bloated (with new ships being introduced as far as the second half of the last episode), there wouldn't be enough time to make the audience care about them even if the writers wanted to.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nI was really hyped for this show when it first aired. The first few episodes were enjoyable, and I went in knowing this show is just pandering to fans of moe and Kancolle, the game. However, as the show went on, it kept getting more and more boring to sit through the 20 minutes of content, as the fanservice kept being recycled and the end of an episode didn't leave me feeling any better about the franchise than when I started.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThe show would have received a much lower score for its shoddy production quality alone, but being a fan of the game and the general franchise, I'll give it a generous 4/10 as there is some slight enjoyment to be had from the show if you're a fan of the game or the media craze of kancolle.",

            "content": "Where am I? Oh yeah I have a review to do for Winter 2015. \r\nSTORY (4):\r\nKanColle is based on a game adaptation by Kadokawa Games. KanColle is about a group of girls who have the spirit of battleships are on a mission to protect humanity form the abyssal fleet. I mean why can't you call it any other name rather than the generic abyssal fleet?  \r\nIn fact, just like Glasslip. I can understand why people didn't like the anime.\r\nThe story has so many events going on that I barely keep track on anything. I know the concept about the WWII ships are interesting butcome on, please focus on one plot alone. The only later episodes then we see the climactic showdown between the abyssal fleet. The rest of the episodes are the girls do their own thing. Just like Glasslip where characters just do their own thing without any consequence. I thought that if there is conflict in this anime, I thought that could work.\\n\\n\r\nThe concept is interesting however, they fail to expand that idea beyond. They just play the easy way out by throwing in random events like the curry contest. They never explore how curry contest is part of their training programme in order to defeat the abyssal fleet.\\n\\n\r\nART (3):\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is dull. I was like watching a nearly dim show.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (5):\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending are nothing special.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER (4):\\n\\n\r\nThe characters suffer from \"Basic Economics\". When I say that, I mean there are too many characters. Although I did like their determination, this anime introduces too many characters that I lost track on what I saw. Nobody is special if too many people are special. \\n\\n\r\nIn Economics, if there is more supply of something, the demand is less. Just like in KanColle, if there are too many characters, the value of the character development diminishes. Some anime suffered from the same problem as the characters from KanColle like for example Brothers Conflict, Kamigami no Asobi & Strike the Blood.\\n\\n\r\nNot to mention the characters design, they were barely discrete.\\n\\n\r\nI barely see the abyssal fleet. They only appear on the later episodes.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION (4):\\n\\n\r\nAs I have said, if the story and characters have better execution, I thought this anime would be entertaining. However, this anime throws in too many characters, that the enjoyment level decreases. You might say \"Oh! You don't like cute girls\". Not true, I like cute girls. However, if you throw in too many characters, the character value will diminish. I am serious when I say this.\\n\\n\r\nDiomedea took the script, shredded it up, put it in the shotgun, add a lot of characters inside it and shot it at the wall. Then we are asked to connect the dots.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has few good moments, however those good moments are weighed down by the problems of this show. So sadly I have to give this anime a 4 out of 10. If you want better experience, just play the games.\\n\\n\r\nThank you, Winter 2015 for giving me another wonderful anime to review. After reviewing this anime, I will be like \"What was that anime again?\"",

            "content": "The \"Mecha musume\" genre of anime (Which turns WWII weaponry and vehicles into cute girls because why not) has been becoming increasingly popular within the last half-decade or so. With that being said, the idea of turning naval combat ships into adorable fap-mater...I mean waifu-material...seemed like an idea that could not possible go wrong. And so one fateful day, Kadokawa Games created a free-to-play browser game featuring over 9000 (Give or take around 8900) different ship-girls that would go on to live in the dreams of otaku everywhere. Following this explosion of moeboats, Diomedea quickly grabbed the premise of Kantai Collection and set sail towardcreating an anime adaptation, knowing that the fans of the game would be immediately \"On board\" for seeing their favorites ships fully animated.\\n\\n\r\nKeizo Kusakawa (Dog Days/Asura Cryin') came on to direct the series which would immediately receive an influx of mixed reviews. Some viewers hated the anime because it was nothing but cute girls doing cute things. But, on the other hand, that was the exact reason that so many other viewers were praising it. So now, critics are split down the middle in deciding whether or not KanColle is worth watching. And the answer to that really depends on what you are looking to get out of it. If you came for a story, go somewhere else -- this show is most definitely not for you. BUT, if you want to watch adorable boat girls just doing their thing, then get the hell on deck.\\n\\n\r\nThe first episode of KanColle introduces you to Fubuki, a destroyer class ship-girl who will go on the be the main character of the series. Fubuki, unlike the other ships, is incredibly clumsy and has zero combat experience whatsoever. Tired of being the weakest of them all, Fubuki goes on to practice day and night in an attempt to not weigh down her fellow boats. After a solid mix of naval combat and fan-service scenarios, Fubuki gains many new friends who will go on to shape the experience of what Kantai Collection really is -- a fun show. But are fun and good interchangeable? That's something you must decide for yourself. But I'm sure you'll get a grip of how I feel about it after I break it up over the next few paragraphs and weigh in on each aspect of the show.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 7/10\\n\r\nThe music of KanColle is actually pretty good. The soundtrack blends traditional Japanese styles with fast-paced and dramatic rock music riddled with miniature guitar solos. The music becomes essential for expanding the atmosphere of the fight-scenes (Which there are a handful of in the show). And the music in KanColle doesn't function the same way that a lot of soundtracks do, meaning it doesn't really blend in. You can always tell that it's there, the impact is not subtle at all. This is both good and bad, considering it can also work as a distraction. One other thing though, is that when the music ISN'T playing, something seems amiss. Like the scenes are too bland without it. And unfortunately, this happens more often than you would think.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\r\nThe sheer amount of characters you come across in Kantai Collection is extravagant. But that is to be expected when the game has a total of 156 playable girls (That number is still rising, by the way). Obviously, not all 156 of the girls get screen-time in the anime. But even without that, it will still be easy to choose a favorite considering how different they all are from one another. However, if you don't choose Kongou as your favorite, you obviously don't know what you're doing. Character development really isn't a factor for anyone other than Fubuki. But the thing with Fubuki is that her development seems a little rushed. Her transition from \"Insanely weak and useless\" to \"Overpowered and unbalanced\" comes along rather quickly. And even though this is a problem, it does not overshadow how delightful and varied the boatgirls in KanColle are.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nI think it's safe to say that Diomedea has outdone themselves with the artwork in Kantai Collection. Out of all of the series they've done that I have had the chance to watch, this one is far superior. Character design is great and stays loyal to the source material. The enemies are dark and gloomy which contrast with the bright and vivid atmosphere of the rest of the show in a way that is basically impossible to ignore. Frankly, I was extremely impressed. When I got myself into this show I wasn't expecting anything phenomenal in the art department, but I quickly retracted those thoughts as the show progressed. HOWEVER, the one thing I really disliked as far as art went was when 3DCG was brought into the mixture. Adding dimension to the girls during floating (Or swimming? Sailing? I don't know what to call it) really took away the detail of their character just seconds prior. It created an inconsistent situation where I could love the image of a character in one scene and then go on to hate it in the next. In my opinion, the art should have just stayed 2D through the entire show.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 4/10\\n\r\nI wouldn't go as far as saying there is no story in KanColle. I would, however, say that literally no one cares about it. Not even the writers. Everyone was just more concerned with watching all the moeboats interact with each other. And those scenes of interaction were great. But every once and a while, KanColle tried to slip some naval battle you didn't care about under the radar in an excuse to further develop Fubuki. I get what the writers were going for, but it really just didn't work. KanColle was unsuccessful in creating a story line that viewers cared about. When that happens, there really isn't much hope for its progression. The story starts to \"sink\" in a way. Ha. Ha ha. Anyway, like I said earlier on in the review -- if you came here for a story, you might as well go watch something else. But if you want to watch different groups of girls act all cute and funny, register for a Crunchyroll account and go check this out. You won't be let down.\\n\\n\r\nThe one thing I wan't to add before I finish up this review is the amount of enjoyment I got out of this show. We can sit here all day and talk about \"What makes a show good\". But as far as I'm concerned, enjoyment has a harder impact on that than anything else. KanColle looks great, sounds great, and a ton of laughs for anyone that is just looking to have a good time. I highly recommend it for anyone that has room left in their \"Favorite characters\" column on MyAnimeList.",

            "content": "When the anime for Kantai Collection was announced and a trailer was released, a milestone was placed for a million fans already set in place. While most were happy and excited for the adaption of the most popular casual game in Japan, people who were already familiar with anime and the tropes associated with the media were worried. This was because the production company was a relatively unknown studio, the art was vastly different from the pixiv artists that make the original character pictures, the ever infamous CGI was going to be used, and with all things that attempt to cater to too many people,artistic liberties were likely to be protracted for a generic anime. Unfortunately, generic is exactly what Kantai Collection is and even as an original fan of the game who went in with little expectations I felt disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nFor those unfamiliar with the series, Kantai Collection (Or Kancolle short) is an online game about ship girls that take their designs based on World War 2 Japanese naval war vessels. Destroyers, battleships, aircraft carriers, you name it. Heavily reliant on moe and the popular concept of girls with war machines (Like Strike Witches and Girls und Panzer), it has become arguably the most popular game in Japan and even parts of Asia not only for otakus but for the casual people as well. The girls fight monstrous demons that rise from the ocean... And well, that's about it for the plot and setting. Not much information on the world is really given and the different sources like the manga and light novels are not official.\\n\\n\r\nThis is perhaps the biggest problem with the Kancolle anime. Perhaps in order to stay faithful to the game, no real world exploration, setting, or story is set in place. It isn't exaggeration to say the plot of Kancolle is literally just naval fleet girls fighting against monsters with added slice of life in the mix. There is no explanation for how the girls \u201cinherit\u201d the souls of World War 2 ships, no exposition on the current state of the world, no details on what humanity is doing and why they have to rely on the girls, no details on how the Abyssals work. The show blatantly just puts out \u201cit's just how it is\u201d and ends the plotline there. And sadly all of this lacking information makes the Kancolle anime feel that it is devoid of substance and leaves many questions unanswered not only for the fans of the original game but for newcomers as well. \\n\\n\r\nThis may have not been so bad if the presentation of the show was well done (As sometimes leaving the audience to their imaginations can be entertaining) but the show simply isn\u2019t. It starts off with the inexperienced girl Fubuki who joins a naval base and slowly pushes herself to become better and be accepted as a regular fleet girl. She makes comrades, goes through training montages, and becomes one of the top fleet girls through hard work and determination. Sound familiar already? It should be as this type of story has been done an exuberant amount times before in anime (especially shounen) and any other type of media really. The plot and script follows a terribly formulaic procedure that is it almost insultingly lazy. And sadly as the episodes drag on they become more and more predictable for any anime veteran that has seen the tired recycled tropes that Kancolle constantly uses.  \\n\\n\r\nWith respect to spoilers, there is a particular early episode in the series that attempts a terrible gimmick to grab the interest of the audience (You will know when you see it). It is perhaps one of the worst written, predictable, and incredibly asinine things to have been done in anime and even the most hardcore fans are likely to be put off by it. Sadly, most of the episodes fail to improve where a chunk of the time is spent on low-tier generic dialogue, fan joke \u201cinside\u201d comedy memes, and then a few terrible build-up of melodrama that\u2019s more cringey than B- movies.\\n\\n\r\nI do by no means hate slice of life, Kancolle just does a terrible job at it as it is filled with a main cast of girls who are uninteresting, boring, and unappealing, arguably even for the fans of the game, and the interactions they have with one another are incredibly bland. When the girls aren\u2019t spouting lines from the online game, they are droning on endlessly about the food they just ate, how nice looking someone\u2019s room is, or regurgitating repeatedly and unnecessarily about the mission they are undertaking. The writing feels as though the script maker and director wanted to waste time and fulfill their 20-minute-a-episode quota rather than try to make enjoyable interactions. The main cast is dull, the side characters are dull, the script is dull, and the anime constantly reuses the same jokes over and over again as cumbersome service to the game fans. The sad part is that the anime should be a platform to better develop the girls from the game and give a wider outlook to the depth of characters, but you would find more characterization and details in to personalities looking at a fleet girl\u2019s Wikipedia page than the entirety of this anime. \\n\\n\r\nIn regards to other production values, the battles are all done in CGI which for the most part look fairly fine and is actually done well, at least when you can ignore the awkward looking faces and the strangely placed transition between drawn scenes and CGI that happen from time to time. When the girls are fighting the CGI is acceptable, but tends to look horrible when the girls are talking and out of the battle transitions. Those who detest CGI in their anime best stay away. While the first few episodes are interesting to see exactly how the water-skating fleet girls fight, especially the first episode that shows a beautiful amount of details and work, the future battles are sadly not the same. Do not be misled by the first episode\u2019s battle; past the opening episode the battles become mundane with generic looking enemies and lazily-made shooting sequences that fail to make full potential naval warfare can have.\\n\\n\r\nThe art itself is mediocre at best and fans may notice a rather drop in quality of their favorite girls (Which may not be entirely blamed on the production company as the online game pictures use various different pixiv artists). There is a number of musical scores within the anime that are soundly produced and pleasing to the ears, and some of the pieces do well to convey the emotions of a scene where the bad script of Kancolle fail. There is a plethora of good voice actors like Nao Touyama and Yuka Iguchi as those who are familiar with the game may know. Unfortunately, the musical ensemble and voices are the best praise this show can receive.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Kantai Collection is everything that is to be expected for good or bad. It's a below average generic show with mediocre writing mostly due to the fact that the producers and director of the show have to cater to an existing fanbas. It is a show that refuses, or is forced not to break out of the mold for any bit of artistic integrity and originality. There are a number of definite fanservice that only the game fans may appreciate; but they are so awkwardly placed within the frame of the anime they feel asinine rather than anything clever and certainly fail to aid new people to the franchise understand Kancolle. With gimmicky writing and no sound source to draw from besides the game which already lacks information on the setting, Kantai Collection simply cannot pass that line to be exceptional or anything ground breaking. It's not a show that I could recommend to someone who isn't a fan of the game or for those that have already watched a lot of anime and can easily predict how the show will proceed. For those who are fans I can only say keep your standards low and expect the expected. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "TL;DR: At face value, it's a cute girls doing cute things show that combines Japanese otaku's two favourite fetishes: high school girls & military hardware. However, as the series progresses, it seems that Kancolle is not only meant as harmless fetish porn, but is in fact an attempt to deal with Japan's demons over their defeat in World War Two by having cute girls dress up as boats & literally blowing those demons up. For all its ham-fisted handling of the subject matter, it's good for a laugh, albeit in a \u201cif you can't laugh, what can you do?\u201d kind of way.\r\nAnyone who follows internationalnews may have seen Japan put its foot in it, so to speak, when it comes to its approach to remembering World War Two. Be it angering South Korea when government figures call for the retraction of Japan's recognition of \u201ccomfort women\u201d as being sex slaves, or Prime Minister Abe angering everyone when he very publicly paid his respects at Yakasumi shrine, it seems that Japan, or at least a sizeable proportion of its population, continues to struggle with how to conceptualise & remember this period in history, or how the echoes of it continue to reverberate in South-East Asian & world politics today.\\n\\n\r\nThis might seem an odd way to start a review of Kancolle (not to mention being simplistic to the point of offensive), an adaptation of a popular pay2win game where cute girls dress up as warships from the Imperial Japanese Navy to fight demons. Well, strictly speaking they posses the spirits of said warships, but it amounts to the same thing. Our protagonist, Fubuki, is the new girl at the all girls scho...navel base where they train to fight the mysterious demons from across the seas. As you'd expect, Fubuki is high on determination & resolve but low on talent or skill, the bulk of the series being about her gradual rise from being barely able to float to becoming the most important battle boat in the babefleet. In addition to her, we have a vast ensemble of other girls whose one dimensional character types loosely match with the ships they represent (the pirate lolis are destroyers, the elegant seniors are carriers etc etc). Much like Girlfriend BETA, the cast is so large that really you can't even try to remember who they all are, or why what they're doing is supposed to matter. (note that from this point things will be discussed that may be considered spoilers)\\n\\n\r\nA lot of Kancolle looks & feels cobbled together from other cute girls shows. There are girls who make animal noises because moe. There's a girl with random mascot creature companions because every show has to have mascots. The bigger ship girls love eating mountains of food because otaku love busty girls with big appetites. There's a random cooking episode in the middle of the series because why wouldn't there be (no points for guessing that they cook curry). There's yuri undertones all over the place & Fubuki has a serious \u201cnotice me, senpai\u201d girl crush on fleet carrier Akagi because of course she does. Even the more serious sides to Kancolle feel like they're just going through the motions. A mentor character dies in episode three because a mentor character always dies/disappears to mark the end of Act 1, only in this case you'd only really know her to be that type of character if you know the history of the ship, since her on screen time is negligible. Even the ending, which is ultimately a we'll fight to change our fate showdown, feels like it could have been taken from almost any other action based anime out there. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, draped around all this generic storytelling & characters is something that becomes increasingly uncomfortable viewing as the show moves towards its climax. As already said, all the girls in the babefleet posses the spirit of an actual IJN warship from World War Two. Indeed, while the plot progresses in a pretty standard way, Kancolle does make an effort to ensure that when things happen to specific girls, it mirrors in some way the actual events their warship counterpart were involved in. Why is this problematic? Well once you see Kancolle as in effect a re-enactment of the Pacific War with cute girls, their demonic enemies can only been seen as the US navy (& possibly also the Royal navy, though less explicitly). Indeed, the final battle is an unapologetic re-imagining of the Battle of Midway, complete with a demon carrier that is easily interpreted as a stand in for the USS Yorktown, where the Japanese win. It's made even more questionable by the preceding event having been a surprise attack by the demons on their main navel base, as though it's not enough to imagine winning at Midway but they had to be the victims of Pearl Harbour too. \\n\\n\r\nIf this had been a German movie re-imagining the Battle of Stalingrad as a glorious Nazi victory, or an American one re-imagining Gettysburg as a heroic victory for the Confederacy, one might imagine it would piss people off a bit. Yes, you can say it's only fiction, & Kancolle is certainly making sure to look as fantasy as possible. But the moment you combine fiction with real events you are in effect expressing a view on those events, & Kancolle's seems to be that its audience should not only be proud of their wartime military but in fact celebrate the military aggression it was involved in, presenting the whole thing as in fact a defensive war against a demonic foreign power that couldn't be reasoned or negotiated with. \\n\\n\r\nWhen looked at in it's current day context, Kancolle ties in with both pressure from the Japanese right on the government (including from some of its own members) to revise what they see as a defeatist & emasculating view of Japan's wartime past & the increasingly bellicose calls for re-militarisation of the Japanese armed forces, including the right to expand the Japanese navy, under the mantra of \u201ccollective self-defence.\u201d Yes, you can say it's just a niche late night fanservice anime that hardly anyone watches & seeing it as anything more is just over thinking, but I disagree. For one, cultural products are not created in a vacuum, & at the very least Kancolle depicts the views the creators &, one assumes, their target audience hold. There are no neutral observers of history & Kancolle choosing to depict its version of history in the way that it does is no accident. It might hide its ideas behind more obvious fan service, but they're still there & they're clearly not meant to be ignored by the audience, even though you can always choose to do so.\\n\\n\r\nOn the subject of fan service, Kancolle is, as you'd probably expect, riddled with it (I'm aware this is a rather awkward tonal shift, from discussing history to boob grabs, but bare with me). When I first heard of Kancolle, I thought it would be more like Girlz und Panzer, in that it would be about actual warships crewed by high school girls. The reality is something much more laughable, as the girls instead transform into weaponised versions of themselves Nobunagun style. I don't know why it was considered good character design, but what this amounts to is girls in high school uniforms, on jet skis, with scale model parts of their ship class stuck to their clothes. It does work to a degree with the carriers, which are depicted as archers whose arrows turn into aircraft upon firing, but for all the others it just looks stupid. Of course, it allows for the girls to strike lots of clich\u00e9 & titillating body poses while firing, so I guess if your fetish is girls wearing bits of boat, it's got you covered.\\n\\n\r\nIt's ultimate form of fan service, however, comes in the shape of the mysterious admiral. In case you were wondering if there are any male characters in Kancolle, there is one. You never see more than his shadow, but he is always there, always with the right plan for victory. All the girls worship him & Fubuki outright loves him, with one out of nowhere dream sequence involving her in a white dress, confessing while looking straight into the camera. Who is this mysterious, genius Lothario, you ask? Well that's simple: he's you*. You, the (presumed male) viewer &/or player who fantasise as is always assumed in cute girl shows that everything the cast do, they do for & because of you. You're awesome, guy watching a cartoon about 13-18 year old girls in revealing clothes, striking sexy poses while playing with phallic military hardware when they're not playing with each other. Shine on you crazy diamond. (at this point the reviewer caught his reflection in the monitor & cried)\\n\\n\r\n*One could also read the faceless admiral as Kancolle's way of getting around depicting Admiral Yamamoto, the actual mastermind behind the Battle of Midway & someone whose actual depiction in a otaku pandering show like Kancolle would have probably caused the producers far more of a headache than it would be worth.\\n\\n\r\nKancolle, then, is a fairly standard action anime with cute girls that does manage to distinguish itself, but ultimately in all the wrong ways. Viewed purely as a TV show, stripped of all context or implication behind its subject, it's not bad but at the same time it makes it very obvious that it is doing everything it can to pander to it's intended audience to the point of obnoxiousness. In a broader context, it is an uncomfortable example of Japan's continued struggle to come to terms with it's role in World War Two or how that role continues to shape the opinions of Japan held by other countries. Hayao Miyazaki said of making \u201cThe Wind Rises\u201d that he felt torn between viewing Japan's military aggression as having been foolish but taking pride in the Zero as a machine & the bravery of the pilots that flew it. Kancolle lacks such a conflicted view, & either by intention or an accidental by-product of poor writing presents a counter-factual version of history where Japan was both victim & victor. It'll take more than a wide eyed girl in a short skirt to make me agree with that.",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nIn an anime like KanColle, with all of its ships, all of its \"moe,\" and all of its torpedoes, there actually exists something that the audience can relate to. And that is the idea of support. Everyone needs help, from the student looking to get tutored for the next exam to the adult wanting to learn how to use the computer. We almost can't get through our daily lives without someone, in some form, providing some kind of aid in our direction. And receiving such support can often times be both a rewarding and eye-opening experience.\r\nSTORY\r\nKanCollefollows young Fubuki, an up-and-coming Destroyer Class ship looking to do what she can in a war that involves her, her friends, and her beloved Admiral.\\n\\n\r\nKanColle is a show that only anime could tackle; essentially, all of the girls from Kaga to Naka are anthropomorphized navy vessels, having turned from venerable war machines into really cute girls. While technically a \"Military\" genre anime, the show is mostly a slice-of-life offering, aiming to showcase the girls at various points in their training, lives, and careers as battle cruisers. And for the most part, the anime is able to pull this off. One tactic used to accomplish this goal is by divvying up the screen time for the majority of its cast. While Fubuki garners the most limelight, the show often times splits characters into respective groups, and even occasionally changing said groups up. In this way, the anime gives the audience the chance to watch their favorite ship do everyday things, from bathing, to eating, and even cooking. Another tactic is in the very nature of a militarized zone: each girl is relegated to specific tasks. While the majority of the girls are designed for battle -- Akagi, Kongou, and Yuudachi come to mind -- some are designed for other, more nuanced tasks. For example, Nagato is the overall leader, Yamato has her own \"hotel,\" and Hibiki is used for collection. By separating the ships into further, more specific roles, when the anime naturally transitions from one location to the next, so do the characters involved.\\n\\n\r\nThe slice-of-life antics only make up about half of the anime; the other half moves into the aforementioned military facet. Here, the various girls actually start to be the very war vessels they actually are. It's at this point the show really begins to suffer. KanColle would like these battles to have any significant meaning attached to them, but sadly there isn't any to be had. While a wide range of girls receive attention, the amount isn't enough to constitute a connection deep enough to warrant their predicaments worthy of drama. Instead, it feels lacking, forced even, that the girls are placed within these situations. And such a feeling also comes from the purpose of the battles themselves; the victory never does anything. They may fight for an island or protect a strategic location, but the outcomes of the fights are always the same: win, go back to base, and wait for the next skirmish.\\n\\n\r\nAmong the cuteness and firepower, KanColle does at least attempt to have some sort of thematic presence throughout its run. \"Attempt\" is the operative word, because the show somewhat fails at doing so. It sticks to the general and tired themes that most cute anime strive for: dealing with hardship, learning to accept others, and fighting against destiny. Nice little motifs, and certainly insights that one can take to heart, but none are looked at extremely seriously and only there for the structure of the anime. Think of the themes as a stack of paper; one piece is pulled from the stack and used to hold the show up. But since it's just one piece of paper, it breaks under the weight it is holding. Yet before it falls, it is held up by the next piece of paper -- the next theme -- only for the process to continue repeating indefinitely. It's not until the entire stack is placed underneath that the anime is prevented from falling. This interconnected support is literally just that: a theme of support. For while each individual, fun message is fine, what they all have in common is this idea of supporting one another, no matter the circumstance. And that's something that is not only consistent throughout the anime, but makes sense in context; whatever kind of military it is, supporting each other is the number one goal.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nKanColle is a mixed bag when it comes to its art and its animation.\\n\\n\r\nThe art for the show can actually be quite nice at times, but it largely depends on location. When the girls are at home base, the track field, mess hall, and dorms may not be detailed exquisitely but it still looks rather pretty. Yet, just like the move from slice-of-life to military, when the girls move onto the water, all of that art disappears. It's replaced with a lot of sky and ocean, with such a replacement losing any flair the show may have generated.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs for each of the ships are nicely done. The girls are given unique outfits depending on the character -- Yamato has her umbrella, Shimikaze has her bunny ears, and Atago has her blue pilot's outfit, to name a few. Furthermore, they each have their own, specialized weaponry to go along with their persons. Depending on the class and the size of the girl, their cannons match accordingly.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to actual animation, it's a bit of a toss-up. When the girls are on their missions, the use of CG isn't too jarring, but the use of their weapons and the maneuvers they pull off aren't anything extraneous. It's usually them standing still, one arm out, and a bunch of smoke that covers the screen. When they're not out on the water, their casual conversations and simple motions are still of the same complexity; quite average.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nKanColle contains quite the large cast. The majority of the characters don't see significant progress, but here it's prudent to take a look at three of the most important from the show: Fubuki, Yamato, and Mutsuki.\\n\\n\r\nTaking the lead, Fubuki is the average main character. She's kind and intelligent, but it's obvious that her skills are far lower than the others in the troupe. She struggles and fights to earn her place among their ranks, wanting to prove to herself and to everyone that she is capable of being the Destroyer that she is. This drive, this incessant need to be more than she is, is what the Admiral sees in her that the rest cannot. It's not so much that she has the largest guns, or can fire the biggest torpedoes, or has the greatest accuracy. What she provides is something intangible, something that not a lot of people immediately have. And that's courage. The courage to train from morning to night without rest. The courage to face your faults, to fix your mistakes. The courage to take a chance rather than holding back. And in this way, her fortitude gives her not only the ability to lead those around her but also support the very ships she calls friends. So while she may be the stereotypical hero, her exemplification of the underlying theme of the anime marks her as at least being slightly more than generic.\\n\\n\r\nIn a stranger position is Yamato. Her enormous firepower makes her the fleet's secret weapon. But because of this, she's kept hidden away, unused in battle and forced to toil on an island that rarely gets visitors. She feels both lonely and worthless for these reasons, which, in a rather interesting way, makes her Fubuki's previous self. For Fubuki was in the exact same position; on the outside looking in and not being able to work with the girls she had come to respect. And so Yamato learns from Fubuki. She sees her determination, drive, and dedication at doing whatever it takes to fix the situation at hand. This instills in Yamato her own sense of purpose; that while she may be constrained to a more unique role, that doesn't mean she isn't valuable in some form. Thus Yamato gains her own kind of courage, showing up when the going got tough and proving to the girls and to the audience that everyone has a purpose.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the strangest of the ships, though, is Mutsuki. She's overtly sweet, always shouting niceties and aiding the friends around her. What's interesting is that she is rarely seen in battle; she makes a few appearances, but her prominence is her location outside of it. And that is usually in a flower field, near a shrine, or at the pier, where she is most often found believing in the aptitude of the ships at sea. She's not particularly noteworthy for her battle prowess, nor is she famous for being one of the cuter girls. In a way, she acts the most human, praying, wishing, and wanting the girls to perform to the best of their abilities, cheering from the sidelines rather than being the very vessel she is known to be. She experiences difficult times -- the loss of the girl she looks up to -- which tests her will, but, in true Fubuki fashion, Fubuki gives Mutsuki the courage necessary to continue believing in the ships around her. For nobody goes through life without problems, thus making how you deal with those issues to be the most important lesson.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe OP contains quite the strong singer, whose vocal power carries the entire track from start to finish. The hard guitar and drum beat work nicely in unison, and help to support the vocalist throughout. The lyrics and tune can be catchy at certain points, though it is still an overall alright piece.\\n\\n\r\nOnce again, the singer takes center stage in the ED. Although here, it features something weird: fast, catchy lyrics. The song is at first not that good of a listen, but after hearing it a few times, one gets used to the guitar, chimes, and quick singing, making the piece the stronger of the two.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack often fits the mood for the show, depending on whether it is partaking in the slice-of-life or military genres it falls under. The former usually uses piano and violins for those everyday sounds, and a single-drum for that training feel. The military aspects, in contrast, incorporate orchestral music for a more resounding vibe. Trumpets and violins work overtime during these scenarios, making the fights gain a heightened feeling of importance. Also of note are the cannon, gunfire, and ocean sound effects that give the battles further realism.\\n\\n\r\nAs for voice acting, those involved give above-average performances. Special shout-outs are in order for Ayane Sakura for voicing what seems to be half of the cast and Yuni Tanibe for her signature \"Poi!\"\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to anime, I'm a fan of cuteness. And while not all of the girls were fun to watch on screen, some were quite entertaining to see. My favorites from the show were Yamato and Nagato for their attractiveness, while Oochi and Kitakami's relationship nearly always got me to laugh or smile. On the other hand, though, I despised Mutsuki. Just the combination of her voice and her extreme sweetness had me wanting her to leave the screen as quickly as she appeared.\\n\\n\r\nThat's pretty much it in terms of enjoyment. The rest of the girls are alright, and there can be some cute moments here and there, but there is nothing entirely memorable. The actual battles, watching the girls at sea fighting against the enemy, were where the anime really began to lag. Instead of seeing the \"cute girls being cute,\" I was instead treated to warfare that wasn't all that impressive or fun to watch. A lot of screaming, a lot of explosions, but zero adorableness.\\n\\n\r\nAs an anime, KanColle does what it set out to do. Its average story and characters are backed by a good amount of cuteness and some interesting sound work, making the whole package an alright experience. At the end of the day, though, there isn't much more to it than that.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fine, interesting slice-of-life, meaningless battles, and individually weak yet collectively strong themes\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Fine, mix of good and bad art, nice character designs, average actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Fine, Fubuki is good, Yamato and Mutsuki are okay, with the rest not seeing significant progress\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fine, okay OP, okay ED, okay soundtrack, nice sound effects, above-average VA work\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Fine, some of the girls are fun to watch, some are not, with the actual ship aspect being rather boring\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 5/10",

            "content": "Kantai Collection or KanColle is an anime adaptation of a hit web browser game. I haven't played the game or seen it. But what I did see before this anime came were pictures, lots and lots of pictures of girls with guns. Not just any guns, torpedoes, missiles, cannons and what not. And of course, I was intrigued as to whether this game would ever become an anime. When the anime was announced, I put it at the top of my list since I wanted to see what awesome action we would get.\r\nThe series started off good, it didn't give as much action as Ithought but the animation and art was splendid except for the CGI part (no one likes CGI). But still, this anime was really good and as a slice of life, military, action style anime, it does a good job.\\n\\n\r\nStory 7/10:\\n\r\nLow score because there isn't much of a story. It's just girls who are ships fighting abyssals or enemy ships/girls. The whole anime surrounds Fubuki, a Destroyer ship who joins the Naval District. She makes friends, trains to become stronger and has senpai's she looks up to. That's the slice of life part. For those who think this is gonna be a dark type war with blood, gore, deaths and some psychological stuff, don't be mistaken. The war barely puts a dent in the happy atmosphere that surrounds the series. Yeah, they do go fighting but that's all there is. The effects of the battle wear off as soon as they return and live like normal girls going to class etcetera etcetera.\\n\\n\r\nThough near the end of the series, stuff gets a bit serious and the war takes a higher importance than the slice of life.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10:\\n\r\nAside from the CGI, the artwork was pretty amazing. Each and every character is awesomely designed. I've seen artworks all over the internet but I think this anime did a pretty good job in the art department. I couldn't find a single character that I can say has a bad design. As for the abyssals, only some have a humanish figure whereas the others are just fish type things with cannons.\\n\r\nThe backgrounds are also really pleasing. So don't worry about the animation in this anime. But you'll have to make it through the battles which mostly take place with CGI   which I do not understand why they did. \\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10:\\n\r\nThe opening \"Miiro\"  is epic. Loved this song. Good enough to download and listen to all the time.\\n\r\nThe ending \"Fubuki\" is also good. Rarely have I seen anime having great opening and endings. The sound gets a 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10:\\n\r\nThere are different types of ship in the navy. Each having it's own abilities, arsenal and tasks. The same is with KanColle. Each girl has a different ship to her. Some are Destroyers, carriers, battleships etc. But they are not alone. In the Naval District, there are tons of Destroyers, carriers and other ships. Each having her own duty. Some are teachers, some manage the district while others study, train and go into battle.\\n\r\nAside from their roles as ships, they are like any other character from an anime. Just think of the girls as from a school slice of life anime. Friends, rivals, senpais and teachers. That's how the characters are. And each has her own unique personality to contribute to the show.\\n\r\nOur main lead, Fubuki is a hardworking girl who doesn't know much at first, but trains to become stronger. Alongside her, are her friends who also take part in training and who worry for her when she gets in trouble or gets injured. Fubuki and her friends are sort of like the first years of a school.\\n\r\nThen come the seniors. Veterans in warfare and having amazing skills, they are the senpais everyone looks up to. Of course, rivalries exist and some grudges too but not so much to spoil the warm atmosphere the Naval District has.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10:\\n\r\nI don't know how can one not enjoy this series (aside from the CGI parts). You've got some fillers to lighten up the mood and your average slice of life just to give this military anime a warm feeling. When the battles start, stuff gets intense, with planes flying around, cannons firing, ships sinking. But like any other slice of life anime, KanColle tends not to kill off many girls even though it is a war.\\n\r\nThe mechanics of the anime are figured out as it progresses. As I didn't play the game, it took some time for me to know how these girls are ships and why the rest or eat as they do.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a good anime. A really good anime for this season. If you've seen pics of any KanColle characters on the net, I'm sure you would want to see this anime too and go ahead, it's worth it. And the best thing is that it's getting a sequel. So many new characters yet to see in action.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Don't take my score rating at face value. Kancolle (the anime) is a mesh of conflicts which makes it difficult to rate, also because of its target audience.\r\nThe anime, before it aired, was announced to be crafted to exhibit a slice-of-life/battle ratio of 70%/30%, and that is where the problem lies. The anime basically hands you a platter of samples from the Kancolle universe but doesn't quite put in the effort to ensure that each sample is well crafted and fully developed.\r\nLet us start with the slice-of-life part first. Here's a warning to those who don't play the game: You won't get much of itat all. Most of the slice-of-life humour and interesting points stem from puns (like the Curry Operation) from the game and real history, to the characters' personalities which are well-exhibited in the game. Even for people who play the game, unless you know your waifus well (i.e. you understand the Japanese lines they say), you will also not be able to catch much. The scripts have the game's lines well weaved in in most parts, and almost every other line you hear will be either an exact or slightly modified line from the game. To fans, this is probably the most appealing part, because it brings out the personalities of each shipgirl and makes them come alive. Some people might dislike the overuse of in-game lines, but I'd say it's most of the time done quite appropriately, and is likely the best way to show the character's personality that we're familiar with.\\n\\n\r\nBonuses are included as well. \"Unexpected\" character behaviours like Nagato (aka Nagamon) and Zui-Kaga are included too, which are based off the fanfics. Good effort! Apart from that, the slice-of-life plot, is typical: entertaining, relaxing, and nothing much happens. Well done!\\n\\n\r\nThe battle scenes are on the whole not too bad, apart from the awkward CGI here and there (and my friend spotted a single frame render error as well). Problem is, it's split as well. About half the battles, mostly at the beginning of the anime, are pretty exciting and nice to watch (they feature the fairies in the planes too!), but then after that it falls stale towards the later part of the anime. By the time you get to the end, it's really nothing new, apart from just more and more ships getting involved and starts to feel cheesy. The battle scenes are the part of the anime which doesn't really require you to know the game since the game battles are not very similar, but it doesn't impress both audiences, which is a shame.\\n\\n\r\nDrama in the show is also very awkward. There are some heartfelt scenes, and I must say I thought the anime (hint of a very slight spoiler here) was going to build up nicely from about ep 3 and ep 4, but it doesn't. The drama doesn't flow from one episode to another well, if any at all. While that's not a problem for slice-of-life, the writers decided to (try to) inject lots of seriousness in certain places, and because it just fizzles out by the next episode without a hint to its previous existence, the whole thing feels contrived.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development is practically zilch, except for the main character, Fubuki, who gets a bit. But I can understand that because it wants to stay true to the game, the characters can't change much. Also, some personalities (like Kongou) are based off the history of the ship itself, and so can't be changed much. With such a wide cast of characters, you'd be hard pressed to find enough time (for the slice-of-life segments) or impact (for battle and drama scenes) to develop any character in particular.\\n\\n\r\nSo on the whole, the anime is just very awkward because all the elements cancel each other out. You get heavy scenes of drama and battles only to be totally forgotten by light-hearted ones later as though none of that happened. They are not particularly well executed either.\\n\\n\r\nOP and ED of the anime is great, and I think, if it was more focused on battles, these songs would fit it very well.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, you'd have to be in to this show for the characters to enjoy it, I'd say, and thus, you'd need to know the characters WELL either by seeing lots of fanfic or playing the game (or both!), otherwise the good parts will just fly past you leaving you with only the bad parts, which is likely why there's a whole lot of people bashing the show. Please be aware of that if you're taking up this series!\\n\\n\r\nPS: I gave it a 7/10 because the 70% slice-of-life part was basically done right.",

            "content": "What\u2019s the best way to describe Kantai Collection? A series based on a browser game with cute fleet girls doing badass things? Or perhaps a series about military warfare with a taste of delicious curry? Regardless of how Kantai Collection should be, the series should be viewed forefront about fleet girls. In essence, Kantai Collection crafts its premise based on a set of characters in a fictional world with historical references. But unfortunately, this show runs like an engine with crude oil and it\u2019s not very impressive to say the least. \r\nIt\u2019s not always easy to adapt an anime based off a game. There arecertain set of principles to follow and not everyone will usually be satisfied to get what they want. Luckily, Kantai Collection is pretty straightforward with a rather non-linear storyline. That\u2019s right. The series may seem complicated with all these characters but the story itself is fairly simple. We follow the footsteps of Fubuki as she enlists herself as a naval destroyer at a naval base. With limited combat experience, she is assigned to the Third Torpedo Squadron. We also quickly learn that the series details events related to warfare pitting the fleet girls against a mysterious enemy known as the \u201cAbyss\u201d. Taken for granted, the series should feel less refreshing but more so to adapt with what it has to offer. Any fan of military fiction may feel at home with this premise.\\n\\n\r\nBut to start from the beginning, one should realize that the original source is a browser game made by developed by Kadokawa Games and hosted at DMM. With fairly simple gameplay mechanics and appeal, the series quickly gained popularity that now has over 2 million registered accounts in Japan. In fact, numerous adaptations of the game has been spawned that includes light novels, manga, and of course anime. So starting from here, one could say that taking on the footsteps of Fubuki is like becoming a new kid at school. The first day isn\u2019t easy as we quickly find out that she lacks military experience. This is evidenced by her lack of ability to glide on water as a fleet girl. Fortunately enough, she receives plenty of support from her friends and in no time becomes accustomed to fighting. The first few episodes show the general premise and style of the show. We are introduced to prominent characters such as Fubuki\u2019s friends \u2013 Mutsuki and Yudachi. Then, there are others from various squads including Kongou, Yayoi, Akatsuki with her Sixth Destroyer Division, Shimakaze, Akagi, Kaga, Nagato, among others. Then, there\u2019s also the mysterious admiral who operates behind the scenes to direct these girls to fight in war. Director Keizo Kusakawa puts his skills at work and to say the least, his resume doesn\u2019t look too impressive in terms of content. His most recent work includes directing another series from the Winter Season (Unlimited Fafnir) also with fictional war-like themes. The funny thing is that both of these shows are made of up a large female cast while his previous involvement follows a similar pattern. \\n\\n\r\nWar itself can be a hard word to swallow. What that means is that pain and death is inevitable. Kantai Collection is no exception when it comes to fleet girls being destroyed. Earlier on in the show, one of them is lost against the Abyss that strikes a painful scar in Fubuki\u2019s heart as she realizes the grim reality. And this shouldn\u2019t be a surprise either given the historical content. Anyone who is knowledgeable about historical reference should already be familiar with the context of the show and the ships. After all, the fleet girls are based off of these ships such as destroyers, carriers, battleships, light and heavy cruisers. In retrospect, Kantai Collection crafts elements of surprises on occasions when we realize that not everyone will survive the war for newer fans. \\n\\n\r\nA show like this also has an over-sized cast. It\u2019s noticeable that not everyone will get enough screen time. However, the show does present a lot of chemistry with the characters. The key word perhaps here is personality because every character in the show has one.  None of them behave like robots as part of some army. In fact, there are even feuds that builds up from little quirks with certain members of a squadron. On an individual basis though, each character portrays themselves on a unique scale. Take Fubuki for example. She comes off as a timid girl but builds confidence as the series progresses and fights alongside her friends. Kongou can be easily seen as the happy outgoing girl who has a heart of gold. Then, there\u2019s Akagi who seems to play an older sister type of character and role model for the younger fleet girls. With a variety of these personalities, you can familiarize yourself to see how they work with the show. Take for granted, each character is assigned with a role as well but teamwork always play a key part to a mission\u2019s success. While it is cleverly crafted, there are also some grim moments to heighten the awareness of the story. Unfortunately, the show also reassigns itself on many episodes with a slice of life tone. What weathers down the show is the balance of the pacing when we sometimes get episodes that just features \u2018cute fleet girls doing cute things\u2019. Part of that includes curry contests, beach episodes, and bath scenes. (which serves more purpose than just pure fan service) Combine that with some diehard comedy and you\u2019ll Kantai Collection served with unconventional fun. In retrospect, it\u2019ll take patience to adapt with shows like this and if the style isn\u2019t your type of thing, then satisfaction will not likely be guaranteed for you.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation can also be a mixed bag at first. The usage of CGI and modifications of the character designs serves as a pivotal factor to craft the basis of this series\u2019 artwork. There\u2019s a variety of characters so each of them must be well designed to fit with their personality. I can say with confidence that the character design did its job to portray the personalities and traits of each fleet girl. But the main course of the artwork comes with the action. The choreography has a charismatic thrill to it but only shines when you appreciate what it\u2019s trying to do. In general, the battles has high caliber amount of action with a genuine attempt to adapt the reality of war. However, be aware that the action itself will feel repetitive as every battle has more or less of the amphibian nature of naval warfare. To cap it off, there\u2019s also bits of fan service. What did you expect? The show is entirely made of female characters so a bit of skin here and there shouldn\u2019t be a surprise; even with some subtle yuri-undertone on occasions. Yes, I\u2019m looking at you Mochizuki.\\n\\n\r\nAs for soundtrack, it\u2019s mildly entertaining. The attractive OP and ED songs gives off a graceful feeling of energy. In particular, the ED theme song has tune that resembles a naval-like anthem for Fubuki and the others. But on a lesser appeal, the show\u2019s OST is hardly noticeable. The only time they truly shine is perhaps during emotional scenes and the action sequences. Their purpose is to draw out the attention that get the audience to feel how it\u2019s like being part of story. Unfortunately, this doesn\u2019t always work and in most cases can be easily forgotten.  Another main noticeable part is the voice mannerism. Each one of them must fit well to bring the fleet girls to life. I do give credit to that being adapted with efficiency in regards to the majority of the cast. In particular, Kongou brings lots of energy into the show with her hyper activeness and broken English. Yudachi and her signature \u201cPoi\u201d can also be noticeable too. The long story short version is that every character has a matching voice to meet their needs.\\n\\n\r\nThe roots of Kantai Collection may intimidating to realize but the show itself is actually more of mindless fun anime than anything else. Despite the amount of military context portrayed, there\u2019s a balance of slice of life indulged with the comedy of each episode. The large cast of characters will be hard to get used to and honestly, it should be painfully obvious to accept that not all of them will get enough screen time. To accept this show though, I think that keeping a keen interest in what it has to offer may be the best way to go. A problem can develop when the show\u2019s story squanders around and behaves wildly at times and then running like gentle air the next. Kantai Collection runs its engines to deliver fun entertainment so you\u2019ll have to accept it or not.",

            "content": "Kantai freaking Collection. How does it feel trying to find your best ship in the anime? How does it feel to be sucked in a world with moe anthropomorphic boat characters doing boat stuff? Well, I hope you managed to enjoy yourself watching the anime. However, there have been mixed opinions about this anime throughout and after its airing. Although many, whether they played the game or not, have actually enjoyed the anime, others are disappointed over the story\u2019s direction. Indeed, there are a number of flaws in the story which I feel that need to be addressed.\r\nFubuki is the protagonist of the anime whobrought herself to the naval district. There was not any clear goal she had until she tried out her first battle with her fleet that she wanted to be stronger and be with Akagi\u2019s fleet. Yes, this is all in the first episode of KanColle. From then on, we see not only the progress of Fubuki\u2019s goal but as well as a ton of ships interacting one another and living their normal lives in the naval district. But danger looms in these girls\u2019 eyes and they have to face their worst.\\n\\n\r\nFirstly, I feel that this anime is unfortunately not geared towards a group of audience who do not play the game. The anime contained humour mostly known for those who played game and knew more about the ships through many sources, whether official or not. To be honest, having watched the anime, I learnt a lot of such humour, and I was amazed by how the fans reacted to them through Twitter. I do not know if many who never played the game will understand the humour, but I think they will just pass it off. Speaking of humour, most of the time they are funny and cute. At least you are given some moe time in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe major problem of the anime is the lack of setting details. I know that there are two sides fighting each other, the Kanmusu and the Abyssal, but what are they fighting for? Land? Resources? What are Abyssal? The story basically lacked about what the girls are fighting against. Also, the timeline can be confusing. I think that the timeline is based on a modern year, however the fighting between the two sides are loosely based on the sea battles during World War II, which the Imperial Japanese Navy fought against the United States Navy. I really hoped the writers can expand this whole event in detail so it can be a lot more understanding. The anime has a lot of potential throughout then which blew all away.\\n\\n\r\nInconsistent pacing can be another problem in the story. Many complained for rushed scenes, especially towards the ending. Sometimes the battles felt rushed because something terrible happened, and things need to be taken cared of. Also, I do not really like how the composition plays within the story. At one moment, you see girls having a lot of fun, then later enemies fly past and a few them might have gotten themselves in trouble. The mood gets ruined and there is just too much emotions running at once.\\n\\n\r\nMany have tried predicting the story through major events in World War II, however the writers pretty much \u2018baited\u2019 a lot of people into seeing who dies in the anime. Many passed it off as a one-time thing, but another bunch think otherwise. Anyway, the whole World War II was just a loose adaptation. Strategic plans in the anime are okay, although the faults lie on the ships\u2019 decision.\\n\\n\r\nAdaptation-wise, I would say it did not work out well. However because of the limitations the game has, it cannot be helped but to break them. It\u2019s not really a big issue but it can certainly be frustrating for some people who watched the anime and tries the game afterwards only to know that they can\u2019t do certain functions.\\n\\n\r\nYou should know that Kantai Collection has a massive collection of ships that takes their names and abilities from past-time Japanese warships. Hence, the anime has a very huge cast of ships. Apart from Fubuki, there are focal characters as well from episode to episode. Of course, with a large cast, this means it is hard to know all the ships, especially for people who never played the game yet. I know most of them, which is a relief.\\n\\n\r\nFubuki, being the protagonist of the story, has a nice steady character development that managed to get the goal she wanted. Throughout her stay in the naval district, she learns a lot from various ships who support her into becoming strong. Despite being moody at times, as well as saving whoever\u2019s life on stake and getting herself in trouble instead, I think she is a nice character to watch. Indeed, she has grown stronger from start to end.\\n\\n\r\nNot much character development I see in all ships but Fubuki. Some of them drive Fubuki\u2019s development, while the rest are just for the character interactions. I feel that some of the characters should have a more detailed background story which probably make the story more interesting. Also, there are a very few characters that just show up for something without any depth.\\n\\n\r\nI have to be honest here but I really do not like the admiral (many fans call him teitoku) in this anime. He does not get a physical appearance and also his actions are just merely bad or confusing. It is just bland.\\n\\n\r\nBeing one of four Diomedea\u2019s anime that aired this season, budget can be a main concern. But looking at this anime, I must say that I am impressed by how it looks as compared to its other anime. But this does not mean the animation is outstanding. As per normal, there are nice sceneries to look at. I like to see how the sceneries matches the mood of the scenes, for example during most of the battles, there is a stormy atmosphere on top. The character designs follow mostly as how it looked like in the game, since the game have different designers working on different cards, at least this anime is standard. It is cool how they don their own equipments, although one can complain these equipments are too heavy for a girl.\\n\\n\r\nThe action scenes are awesome to look at. A lot of CGI is used in many action scenes and I think it is great since it gives the animations nice and smooth. However there are times when CGI should not be used, such as interactions of characters during battles. I like the visual effects that they made as well.\\n\\n\r\nI really love the opening and ending songs a lot and they are one of my favourite songs of this season. AKINO came back after AmaBuri\u2019s Extra Magic Hour with Miiro, a very energetic song which is great to rock at. A newcomer, Nishizawa Shiena, performs Fubuki which I find it really emotional to hear. At first I was not fond by hearing it but after a while, it just clicks to me. I shall be expecting more of her voice in the future!\\n\\n\r\nThe background music is okay, not too outstanding as well. I like some of the battle tracks that makes the battles more interesting to hear. Basically the background music has a wide variety of tracks from battle music, to slice of life music, to emotional music. Finally, I really want to give praise to all the voice actresses, especially Sakura Ayane and Touyama Nao, for voicing a lot of roles in the anime. The voice actress roles in the anime are as identical as the game, so there should not be any worry.\\n\\n\r\nSo, did Kantai Collection live up to my expectations? Not really, but I\u2019m just disappointed with the story as I wish it can get better at some point. Meaningless to say, I also enjoyed most of the anime, mostly being comedy and cute ships doing cute things. I have also been shipping quite a number of ships lately, and I know Ooi and Kitakami is one of the best shippings ever.\\n\\n\r\nA sequel was announced after the final episode ended, and I\u2019m not surprised to see that. It\u2019s obvious that Diomedea and Kadokawa wants to milk more money from us viewers. I really hope the sequel gets better. And certainly, with this season, there can just be more KanColle players in the game, so I really hope they are enjoying themselves.",

            "content": "Even taking into consideration the genre and source material this anime utilizes, this show in particular has been (upon reflection) one of the most over-hyped, predictable and bland products I've ever watched. Paper-thin plot, cardboard cut-out characters, and dialogue that made me cringe with embarrassment at what I was listening to. The game at least has the possibility of death which brings a weird quasi-darkness to it considering your cute \"waifu\" can end up at the bottom of the sea. Besides 2 supporting girls sinking so far, we've had nothing but predictable battles with hilariously bad CG effects, and SoL in-betweens with moe forced onyou so hard it kills the atmosphere and makes you wonder if there's actually a war going on. I know it's fucking moe yadda-yadda and is adapting the browser game to milk the fanbase even more with cuteness but sorry, knowing that DOES NOT excuse this show from being a bland and cliche' as fuck mess. SW and GuP share some of the same problems, but they're a bit more subdued and certainly smarter in the way they are handled so I like them quite a bit. I probably wouldn't be as mad if I wasn't greeted every episode with OP and ED sequences that try so god damn hard to be Epic. They could really add some meaningful drama if the girls had to cope with the fact that they couldn't escape the fates of their past namesakes... but no, we all know Fubuki is going save the day with friendship, break all the laws with love, and change history with compassion... This show had promise in the beginning to not just be another cliche' moe wank machine, but that is exactly what it turned into. It saddens me greatly to know that this kind of crap will almost certainly get a second season, wheras other more thought provoking shows, and even better moe shows, will fall to the wayside. I guess that's the anime world we live... it may be fruitless to try and fight it, but god dammit if I can save one other human soul from watching this junk then that's what I'll do. I won't be a mindless zombie attaching myself to this just because of the moe, hype, or bandwagon. For a better World War 2 themed military-moe, do yourself a favor and look up Strike Witches.",

There is a lot of yuri subtext ( I was surprised, though its not unusual since all the characters are girls besides the admiral). The show is pretty enjoyable.",

            "content": "Hi, this will be my second review.  Includes light spoilers, may or may not be properly done.\r\nKantai Collection is obviously, about the game of ship girls or fleet girls, whatever. It's enjoyable.\r\nAight, soooo let's start.\r\n========\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nThe story here is pretty much similar to some anime series out there. Things happen where MC was weak and then they get experience from the things they do blablabla. There's also the 'sudden problems that appear' trope I just made up for this review. The anime also contains some cheesy dramatic stuff on some parts which made me, uh, cringe a little. I wonder how I got pastsuch cringey drama when I watched (now to bring an unrelated anime here) Love Live back then. Damn, that show was great but the drama on some parts were, ugh. There's also the 'sudden rescue' trope I also just made up, in this show.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: Story is the same shiet you can get from OK shows, drama is kek.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nHere's where it gets real; The art is amazing, the water animation is so smooth, CG is great. I like the battle scenes in 3D. tbh the only show I've seen having CG shown for over 30 seconds is  Love Live. I like the art style here. The game art is, well, diverse (you may interpret this in a good or bad way, up to you :P).\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: Nice art style, CG, bla.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nAyy. Miiro is one of the best OPs I've heard this season. Along with Flyers from Death Parade. I like how they kept the VAs from the game. Also some sound effects. It's all good. I never wanted to listen to the ED though. topkek.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: Great sounds, voices, etc. yeah.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\r\nThose who don't play the game would probably hate this.\\n\\n\r\nNot much character development, understandable due to the large cast, and the time given for the show (1-cour). Hopefully S2 does better here.\\n\r\nAnyhow, the personalities of the characters from the game are retained (yay) and how they say the same stuff from the game too >Atago, Tama, etc. etc.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: Not enough character dev. But it's all good.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nI'd say I really liked this show despite some problems and how the system of the game is not similar. (I wish I could send multiple fleets to a mission at once :P). I believe the fanservice here is a-okay, could've been too much, but eh.  Plot is mediocre.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: It's good. LOL.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nYes it's an average. Here's the TL;DR of the whole review, including the TL;DRs for each section:\\n\\n\r\nIt's great, if you know the game. If you don't, it could be okay.\\n\r\nIt's enjoyable, to say the least. Could've been better. :D\\n\\n\r\n11/10 Would watch season 2. Needs more Shimakaze lolz.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nOverall: 41/50 = 82%\\n\\n\r\nAight, that's how I score stuff. Hopefully this review helps. :D\\n\\n\r\nwww\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Hooray! Kantai is finally over, and damn it is getting a second season! So here is a bird to Diomedea and DMM, for continuing to cash cow this work. Anyway a review on the show, Kantai is a cashgrab, made by money hungry fags for its fan base. It is not a anime you would watch unless you are a fan (or a moe zombie, in which case a bird to you too).\r\nFlame bait aside, time to get serious. There are two results when one adapt a game into an anime, one is when you create a watchable show by actually adapting, the other iswhen you create garbage by tossing in a bunch of references to the game. Here is the thing, most of the people who watch the show is not going to play the fricking game, when you make an anime you should be trying to appeal to the faction that isn't already in the fan-base. But who am I kidding, most anime writers are idiots anyway.\\n\\n\r\nstory - 3\\n\r\nShip Waifu wacky hijink, some people say it is something about girls being reincarnation of ships and etc. But don't be fooled, it is ship Waifu wacky hijinks. I don't care how many references you make to WWII, or how accurate some of the details are, it is all dressing, if the meat of the show is wacky hijinks with ship waifu, then the details means nothing. It is all just fanservice for military otakus, and boring details for anyone who isn't a military otaku. \\n\\n\r\nThe show try to have a couple serious moment, but let's be honest here, I'm not going to care that a cardboard cut out was sunk. You don't take the scenario serious from the start, neither will I, SHOCK FACTOR is a really cheap trick.\\n\\n\r\nEven the setting doesn't make much sense, but this was originally a browser game, so I'll let that pass. But I was still disappointed since I was expecting anthropomorphic ships, not girls with the souls of ships.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8\\n\r\nJarring CG transitions during some of the combat scene, even though the cg isn't utter shit, it looks like f**king MMD so much that I question whether they really used MMD to make those scenes. Everything else was decent.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7\\n\r\nTracks okay, not much to say.\\n\\n\r\ncharacter - 3\\n\r\nPOIPOIPOIPOIPOIPOIPOI, oh god I hate that sound. The characters are cardboard cutouts, and that is totally expected when you have so much character and so few episodes. A smart man would focus on a couple characters to flesh them out, but since Kantai exist only to rob the wallets of idiots who bought the BDs to see their ship Waifu, it shoves a bunch of them into the show. The result was that instead of characters, we have cardboard cutout with shiticks. And it gets insufferable, when you realize at the end of the day, you just want to see them all sunk, screw moe, I want a character not a bunch of cardboards.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 4\\n\r\nSome may ask, if you hate it why you watch it, the response would be, if you don't watch it you wouldn't know how to hate it and how it could have been better. Plus the major reason would be, to see how the current biggest doujin series turned out since it is a bit more popular than Touhou right now. Such a big doujin giant getting an official anime, I wanted to see how it would turn out, and god I am disappointed. When your anime is worse than your doujin manga, you know you f**ked up big time, in fact it made me doubt Kantai even deserve to have so many doujin artists, since a lot of Touhou artists jumped ship (pun intended) to try to flesh out Kantai. It is really disappointing to see that the actual people who made the thing cared so little about the show, turning it into a soulless cash-grab.\\n\\n\r\nWe could have gotten a emotional story about anthropomorphic ships in a war, with losses and philosophy, showing the cruelty of war while referencing WWII. But instead we got, fricking cute girls doing cute things #ILostCount with ship references throw in. So once again, screw you Modern Anime, this is why we can't have good things.",

            "content": "KanColle has an even dumber concept than Strike Witches. As if pantsless lolis with boot propellers wasn't stupid enough, here we have Fleet Girls\u2122 which are basically qt 3.14s with assorted ship apparatuses that magically summon from the ethos (or variously must be equipped) and transform the grills into some vague reference to WW2 Japanese ships while they maintain their qt-ness. \r\nAnd yet it works. It works really well.\r\nEach ship (or grill) has a distinct personality. Some, like the Yamato, are hilariously tied to the IRL circumstances of their namesakes, but others are just...silly. We have lesbian ship sisters, the boisterous Kongo quartet, wizened fleetcarriers, and naturally there are loli torpedo boats with the gamut of anime tropes. Fubuki is the star of the series, a Fleet Grill\u2122 who starts as a clumsy good-for-nothing but grows into a hero who saves everyone (not really a spoiler, since this is an anime and that happens in literally every single anime ever).\\n\\n\r\nAll that's fine, but it's the details that made KanColle so good for me. The carriers use bows to fire arrows that poof into planes piloted by doll things (???), destroyers fire groups of torpedoes from their legs like some caricature of a boy doing the humping motion, and battleships make a grand gesture of giving the enemy a full salvo. The ship/grills heal from damage by soaking in a hot spring, when a ship is ready to be refitted they start glowing, the carriers and battleships eat about 400 tons of food per day. Even the seaplane tender girls have fantastic details with their setups. The best part is that it's presented with a nod for magic realism: nothing is explained, it just *is* and that's that. I know this is based on some vidya, and that's super obvious, but even though I haven't played said vidya I still appreciated the entire package.\\n\\n\r\nI know I'm a sucker for all things naval (except the soul-draining leech that is WoWS....ugh) and that definitely predisposed me to enjoy this, but I absolutely recommend KanColle for anyone searching out a great time.",

            "content": "I really wanted to like this show. I really did. Being the fan of Kancolle I am,\r\nI just cannot hate it completely, but this show was a disappointment.\r\nIt is a huge potential wasted, thus a frustration to those familiar with he game and fandom.\r\n-What potential?\r\nKancolle is a browser game that came out in 2013. It gained popularity far beyond the expected level, so much that the servers can't handle the demand and new players are allowed into the game via a lottery system, japanese and non-japanese alike.\r\nWhat made the game this popular, was the doujin market around it.\r\nThe game had a vast amount of characters,interestingcharacter art, very good voice acting and music. The effort (and love) put into it was beyond the level of what one would expect from a free to play browser game. Thus, soon the fandom started expanding beyond the game. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters were given unofficial traits based on their lines or behaviour in the game, -Akagi having a huge apetite due to consuming high amounts of resources in the game, Nagato being into cute things, Murakumo becoming the badass for no reason I know of- theories were built around the enemies -such as them being the malice of war,sunken vessels, zombie ships so to say- which gave birth to many comics that are unique in their own way, fun or serious, action-packed or laidback. \\n\\n\r\nThe reason Kancolle keeps getting compared to Touhou isn't simply because its doujin market caught up to it in numbers, but because the way both their fanworks are: They hugely expand the concepts of the source they are feeding from. \\n\\n\r\nKancolle as a game, does not have a story. It also does not need one.\\n\r\nBut when you're making a show, a scenario is needed. What the writers had to do was to do a throught research on the fanworks, and realize what Kancolle had been made into by the majority. But they failed this task.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-Characters: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nEven this score may be biased because I simply cannot unlearn what I have from the fandom. But the anime does a terrible job on the characters. First of all, they tried to\\n\r\ninclude too many charcters into a very short airing time. There is a \"let's show as many characters as we can so that we please every fan out there\" mentality going on. Yes, I said every \"fan\" out there. Because if you are not familiar with the character already, it's not possible to actually get attached to any of them. The reason for this is the ridiculously short screen time supporting everyone but Fubuki (MC) gets, and their dialouges mostly consisting of their lines from the game. So to anybody who is not already familiar with them, what the characters say, the way they think and react will make little to no sense. Even for those who know, portrayal of the characters are super weak.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-Story: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nAh, yes, the story. The first 3 episodes had one going, so I give one point for each. After that, it just becomes a mess of events. It feels like the studio gathered 12 people for each of the episodes, then they had a meeting on the basic storyline. \"Alright gentlemen, we are going to start from point A, then stop by B, and conclude with C.\"\\n\r\nThen, eveybody starts writing their own episode without knowing what the person before them wrote in their script. After the first 3 episodes we just have a major battle that keeps being postponed without seeing any real preperations for it, events that literally cancel each other out,(To keep it spoiler free,think of a character painting a wall blue for 3 episodes, then \\n\r\npainting it red for next 2), things just coming out of the blue and even a filler that doesn't even manage to fill anything. And then a VERY anti-climatic ending. Yeah, even if you were to collect random doujin plots and brought them together, it would probably make this much sense, if not more.\\n\\n\r\n-Art: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nDespite the 3d CGI, the rest of the show was pretty good I think. And 3D CGI looking bad isn't a problem unique to this series, I've yet to see 3D that doesn't stick out except Rebuild of Evangelion series. While the models look like slightly advanced MMD models, the animating of them were pretty good I think. The battle scenes were quite dynamic and in a series like this where combat is a major part, unfortunately this is inevitable. Other than the 3dCGI, everything was decent and enjoyable. We had very nice backgrounds, distinct changes in atmoshpere between different places of the Naval District. I enjoyed both the battlefield and recreation facilites. Character art was also pretty good, I think they handles Mutsuki's gradient hair pretty well.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-Sound: 11/10\\n\\n\r\nYes,if there's one part of the series that is perfect,it's the sound department. Both the voice actors and OST. Looking at the seiyuu list, you might think the developers were tight on budget, but this is a brilliant \"tech demo\" of the voice actors. Many charcaters are voiced by the same people, yet it's not noticable in the slightest. I watched a scene where 4 charcters talked to eachother, and was shocked to find out it was literally one person talking behind the scenes. My respects to each VA taking part in this show, that's incredible. I mean, being able to change their tone might be a crucial ability for the VAs, but it's impressive to be exposed to it in a single show and a single episode. The OST does a real good job too, was kinda disappointed that the show didn't have any OST from the game at first, but now I am glad it added to the already wonderful soundtrack of the franchise. Opening and ending are great as well.\\n\\n\r\nMight be a disappointment in terms of a show overall, but I nominate it for the best OST of the year already, as there aren't many anime that manage to stand out in this context.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-Overall: 4-6/10\\n\r\n-If you are a regular person simply looking for a new anime to watch, unfortunately I cannot recommend it. 4/10\\n\r\n-If you are a person who wants to get into Kancolle, this is definately not the point to start. stayaway/10 \\n\r\n-If you are a fan of Kancolle, it's likely you will enjoy it more than regular peeps, but cringe at the potential it's wasting. 6/10\\n\r\n-If you are a fan of military stuff, give it a try I say. You're here for torpedoes and planes anyway, and you will get it. 7/10",

            "content": "Kantai Collection -KanColle- is an anime that tell us a story about how the humans lost the control over the sea because a new enemy known as the Abyssal Fleet conquered it... \r\nThe story of KanColle begins with a short battle showing what are de \"Kanmusu\" or Shipgirls, that are girls with the power of ancient ships of the Japanese Navy (It's based on a Browser Game where there're ships from USA, Italia, German... too but in the anime only appears the Japanese, for the moment I hope)\r\nAnd then the plot begins, the first that we saw after this it's a plane flying by thesky and a girl, Fubuki, seeing the plane. The anime will be narrated by the point of view of Fubuki. The first episode is the typical episode that introduce you the anime.  The problem is the lack of development of Fubuki, she has development but it's null... I mean, we will know that in so moments she is a brilliant person who could know what it's going on only because a warning that the secretary ship gave to her.  But this fall it's forgotten because the anime doesn't care about her. The anime only care about HER GOALS. Or this is how I interpreted it. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters... well in this anime we have a lot of cute shipgirls, like Akagi, Kaga, Kongou... they're very interesting characters, the relationships in this anime are so important, for example Kaga has a kind of senpai over the 5th Division of Aircraft, we're Shoukaku and Zuikaku, and it's based on historical references. The First Division have jokes over the Fifth Division. And Kaga always has some dialogues like \"I don't want to be near the fifth division\" but in the end it show that Kaga feel like the first division must have a senpai role over the Fifth. Other relationships are in more \"romance\" tone, probably because the historical counterpart fights along or because the historical counterpart was worried abount her in the last battle...  This \"romance\" are ok, because you can see that they're humans. There're a moment where the Secretary Ship, Nagato blushes because Mutsu (Her sister ship) says that NAGATO it's important to her. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound well... I can only remember the Opening and the Ending... and a few parts of the OST...\\n\\n\r\nThe Art it's... well there're part very well animated but others have a weird CGI that could make to close the episode, because in some points it's a very annoying CGI.\\n\\n\r\nBut in the end this could be one of my top 10 favorites animes. It's because KanColle was the first anime what made me interested the characters instead the battles.\\n",

            "content": "In spite of  what people say about not seeing this if you haven't played the game, I would recommend this anime for the non players. I haven't played the game, and I probably won't and I haver really enjoyed Kantai Collection. In any case, as this anime is based on a game of WWII ships it won't make any harm knowing a bit of history and the kind of ships that were used. A bit of Wikipedia will help you understanding certain things and enjoying the anime. \r\nStory (4/10)\r\nThis is one of the main weak points of the anime, the lack of story. Iwouldn't say that there is no plot, but is too ambiguous and bad connected. Most of the things are not explained at all, so you'll have to deal with it and imagine things on your own or checking them in Wiki's. I give it a 4 just because at least they didn't invented a complex story and if you take it as a some kind of slice of life it isn't so bad.\\n\\n\r\nArt (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nI can only thing of the art as superb. It's difficult to review it just because everything in this regard is just perfect. Character design, animation, light, color... all of them are of the highest level. This anime uses a lot of CG, even on the characters, but in a such a good way that enhances the animation without making the characters look bad. I specially liked how the planes were animated. I love WWII planes (more than ships, I'm sorry) and I want to marry the people that animated them for this anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nSame goes here. I don't usually like the opening and ending songs of animes. I know there are people that like them but I don't. But in this case the opening was, in my opinion, even good, which is a lot to say coming from me. Apart from that the voice acting is really impressive and the sound of the battles just amazing. I would recommend to see this anime with a nice sound system (or good headphones) so you can fully enjoy the battles.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (5/10)\\n\\n\r\nThere are a lot of characters. Really, a lot. I find this both good and bad. On the one hand you won't get bored of the same characters all the time, mainly because they are to plain, but on the other hand is impossible, at least for me, to know all of them.There were times when they were talking about somebody and I didn't know who. In any case there is almost no development on the personalities, and I give them a 5 because most of them are funny and different.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoy seeing this anime. It is very funny with a lot of jokes, a lot of stupid characters... It made me laugh plenty of times. The battles are really well made and I also enjoyed them. There is even a bit (or more than a bit, but nothing hardcore) of yuri which is always well received in my case.\\n\\n\r\nSummary\\n\\n\r\nMy overall mark is 8/10. The lack of plot and the simplicity of the characters contrast with the outstanding art and sound. From a technical point of view this anime is just amazing but it won't change your life in the slightest. In any case is funny so if you have some free time it's a nice idea to give it a try.",

And there are stories about the bloody inter-Asian conflicts (even before WWII); the non-aggression pacts with Jew-murdering Nazi Germany and Italy; fake states like Manchuria; slaughter; cannibalism; and the Imperial Japan's eventual downfall because of the ticking off ofAmericans, Russia, and China (because they were having their own civil war).\\n\\n\r\nYou will find little in terms of \"historical accuracy\" in Kantai Collection; an anime based on a web-browser game that's basically \"Strike Witches on a boat.\" Some upskirt panty shots while in \"part-time computer-generated\" action and all.\\n\\n\r\nNo, I'm wrong. It's not \"Strike Witches on a boat.\" Strike Witches featured more characters from around the world sorta.\\n\\n\r\nI mainly disliked the series because it's basically \"Cute Girls Doing Cute Things.\" And, outside of the sinking of Kisarage; there was no effort from the people behind this animu to show the shipgirls as anything but victorious and invincible.\\n\\n\r\nI also disliked it because there's no effort to delve further into the enemy; the Abyssmals. Who are they? Where do they come from? Why is it so important for the Japanese shipgirls to \"take the sea back\" from them? Why is it not the job of everyone else around that general area? How can we non-KanColle-players NOT know that the Abyssmals are the placeholders for the \"evil Americans?\" who came and kicked their their racist imperialist butts?

            "content": "Why am I writing another review for a series that already has like 30? This review will be different for 2 reasons: first, because of the direct contrast with the last anime I reviewed; and second, because I'm going to be focusing on thematic elements a lot more than previous reviews do. I'm not going to complain about the CGI (eh, it's better than Initial D) and I won't say anything more about the music after noting that the OP/ED are totally awesome. That said, there are going to be some SPOILERS in here, at least in a general sense, because I'm going to betalking about this show's thematic weight, and about how it works as rewritten history.\\n\\n\r\nFirst, the contrast. Superficially this show ought to share a lot with my last review, the miserable Valkyrie Drive: Mermaid. I mean, it's action girls up the wazoo, right? And fan-service? And pick-your-favorite-waifu as though it were a harem show? But if you look past those superficial similarities, this show really shines by comparison. First, while I'm not going to deny the obvious shout-outs to people who've played the games or are interested in the historical in-jokes, there's surprisingly little sexy-type fanservice. I recall maybe 2 panty shots, and they're really quick flashes during action sequences, plus some obligatory breast size jokes (but fairly limited ones).\\n\\n\r\nEven more importantly, this is a show that (despite its underlying concept being, well, kind of stupid) actually manages to earn the thematic weight of the occasional serious moments. There's an event maybe 1/3 of the way into the show that really comes out of nowhere--but is not glossed over like the uncounted attempted (not to mention the completed) rapes in Valkyrie. It's shocking in its tonal shift, but the show has the wisdom to stay with this event and devote serious screen time to showing the reactions of other characters over a fairly long course of time. Unlike Valkyrie, where this feels like a cheap, repulsive gimmick, here it adds a lot of weight to what the characters are dealing with. And it comes in a way that raises the stakes for the rest of the show. The show designers and writers had the guts to do this once: are we really going to be able to sit back and enjoy the Cutest Little Child Soldiers hanging around ganbatteing in class and eating ice cream afterward? Or are we going to think, wait, what'll happen in the next mission, is anybody really safe? Yeah, you're going to get a curry episode in the middle. You know what that's called? It's called tension relief. Even Evangelion had comic moments, you gotta spot the show an ep to let the audience relax before the next big arc.\\n\\n\r\nOn that note--we actually get serious arcs, with missions that span several episodes, and are clearly building toward something. Missions with goals and stuff. We have both progress and setbacks. During the course of the anime, it is not at all clear what the ultimate outcome of the war will be. (I mean, there's sequels, so you can probably guess that Our Heroes don't outright lose. Yet. But who knows what S2 will bring? And if the season ends with them on the ropes, the story isn't *over*, it'll encourage everybody to go out and fight harder in the game, right?)\\n\\n\r\nOf course, the show does suffer from Cast of Thousands. I always take notes when I watch anime or read manga, because I want to remember everybody's names for later, and you usually don't have a lot to go on to tell them apart... well, these episodes took me over half an hour each because I was typing so much in my note file. I think I have a hundred lines of character summary and relationship mappings. Phew. Of course, that's because we're basically listing every freaking boat that ever showed up in the Japanese navy, which all have to be included so you can... buy the merch? Get more hype about the game? Spot your favorite shippuwaifu? Idk. But they're all in there, and if you aren't writing it down or already familiar, you're going to lose track.\\n\\n\r\nThe second angle I want to cover is history. This is both the biggest fanservice element (imo), but also where it gets a little... awkward. Particularly for the American audience. The conceit of the show is that our Cutest Little Child Soldiers are somehow karmically linked to the souls of battleships... of the Japanese Navy. Of World War II. Now you might pause a minute, and scratch your head, and recall that exactly one Japanese capital ship actually *survived* the War... and think maybe that doesn't bode so well for Our Heroes. This feeling will get even stronger when you realize that the missions in the arcs of this anime actually map shockingly closely to historical engagements and events. The last third of the anime is a really amazingly close retelling of the Battle of Midway (go read the Wikipedia page and then watch episode 11 and just try to disagree). That's when it dawns on you that the Abyssals--they really are basically the American navy, fulfilling many of the same roles... we even have a creepy demonic USS Yorktown as an antagonist. So my grandmother was in this navy, and now I'm emotionally invested in seeing their dark doppelgangers get whupped? Surreal.\\n\\n\r\nThis is also where it should get weird or awkward for the Japanese audience. Because to tell this story, moreover to tell a victorious story, or most of all an *uncomplicated* story, with this history, you need to make some pretty radical changes. Here the USN analogue is actually just a mysterious force that arose from the depths and are clearly the aggressors. And to square that circle of \"IRL these girls all wound up dead lols\" we throw in a different element in the form of our main character, Fubuki, who is pretty much the poster girl for Yamato-damashii (see http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JapaneseSpirit). She's gonna try super hard and believe super strong and motivate the whole fleet with the Power of Friendship, and by Nimitz that's actually going to change things! This is a *simplification* that actually *makes things complex*, because those are obviously very admirable qualities and make her, and all of them, likeable and relatable characters; but in the process they create a historical narrative in which just a little more Japanese Fighting Spirit (and a little more strategic flexibility and anti-aircraft gunnery) would've saved the day. This winds up being uncomfortably nationalist: Japan the aggrieved victim; the eventual triumph of a particular Japanese national spirit and character; the sanitization and justification of Imperial Japan's role in the war--this is straight out of any Uyoku Dantai group. Decomplicating the original conflict complicates the work.\\n\\n\r\nComplicates because, the political implications aside, it's a formula that works. Everybody loves to cheer for the underdog; we like our heroes to be obviously heroic and lovable and not have to carry the weight of the atrocities that go with real war on any side; the best baddies are of course the arbitrarily hostile alien force that Shot First. And it's a kind of intriguing reworking of history, too, because with a little more strategic flexibility and anti-aircraft gunnery, things really could've been quite different. At the end of the day, this show won me over, from the characters (even if I ran out of fingers and toes) to the historical what-ifs. It's just tough to keep an eye on the line between alternate history and emotional support for actual revisionism.\\n\\n\r\nIn any event, if you watch the show (as you should!), you may find it quite interesting to read Wikipedia along with. I know I did.",

            "content": "I shall preface this review by stating the fact that I have not played KanColle, and have extremely poor knowledge of World War II era planes, as well as events during the Pacific Theatre of that war, and this may have potentially detracted from my experience, but I digress.\r\nKanColle is a SoL about the browser game of the same name, involving a group of anthropomorphised Japanese WWII-era warships who must fight against some alien creatures. The story for the most part takes place from the perspective of Fubuki, who is not as skilled as her comrades, but is determined to improve herself, largely out ofadmiration for Akagi. However, here lays one of KanColle's predominant shortcomings - there is a very large cast of characters and it is safe to assume a player of the game would like to see their favourite ship in action, but this is the problem. When you've got 12 episodes, and a very large cast of characters, the end result is a small amount of characters who retain a large amount of screentime, whereas the rest see next to none, and this is quite problematic due to the fact it often becomes a bit of a jumbled mess of characters, none of which the viewer comes to particularly care about. Additionally, the characters that are given significant screentime aren't the most in-depth either, with the show often relying on simple catchphrases and uninteresting formulaic quirks, rather than anything particularly substantial. I can't really think of anything major about any of the characters, beyond Kongou speaking in Engrish a lot and Yuudachi ending all her sentences with 'poi'.\\n\\n\r\nBut this isn't all KanColle rests on, it's a story of two halves - the moe and character interactions, but also the action, so how does the action fare? All things considered, I'd say quite well. The show does make considerable usage of CGI (which I found less intrusive than I normally do, I theorise due to the fact all the fighting takes place in water, so it doesn't look as out of place). The action isn't anything to write home about, it's serviceable, but also a bit forgettable, and I'd say this could apply to the entirety of KanColle. It's not bad by any means, but it's just all too average to really keep you excited or emotionally invested or anything. Oddly enough, the finale, which should be expected to be the strongest episode, I'd wager to be the weakest. Climaxing with a recreation of the Battle of Midway, no doubt the most important battle for the IJN or Japan as a whole during the war, it was all a bit underwhelming. You really don't get a strong feel for the huge scale of the battle, and I'm not going to critique the lack of historical accuracy, as ultimately the only thing KanColle has in common with actual naval battles of WW2 are the names of the ships, but it just seemed an awfully poor missed opportunity. It's just so commonplace for any action series to have a huge battle at the end, wherein the main character(s) emerge victorious and celebrate, but it hardly felt any different to the minor skirmishes they'd engaged in beforehand.\\n\\n\r\nThe film, titled KanColle: The Movie, is unfortunately more of the same. Perhaps a little more organised than the anime in terms of usage of characters (i.e. who gets placed in, and when) and more action-oriented than the original, but it too isn't anything special. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, KanColle's just average. I'd say that whatever it is you want to see, you've probably got a stronger alternative, but if it does look as though it appeals to you, then you'll most likely get what it is you expect, if you are who I presume the main target audience for this to be, and players of the game, and just want to see your favourite ship in animated form, then I think it's good enough, you'll get what you want. But for everyone else, it's not got much of a saving grace.",

            "content": "My first ever review on MAL goes to my favorite fandom to be a part of. This is not just a review of the Kancolle anime, but Kantai Collection as a franchise, because in order to understand why the anime is good, you must understand Kancolle in its entirety. Don't worry- Ill be sure to explain everything and how it pertains to the anime. I hope to those who read this it will allow you to look over all the hate this anime receives and understand why it can be a good show.\r\nFirst, a preliminary. If you don't know, Kantai Collection (Kancolle) is based offof a Japanese web browser game of the same name where anthropomorphic WWll era warship girls (called Kanmusu) are the main cast. The game was launched in 2013, and has had an extremely large following since then, growing to over 3 million players. The game is solely based on micromanagement of your fleet in attacking bots, PVP, and going on expeditions. The game has no strategic gameplay, and focuses heavily on RNG.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason why this anime receives so much unwanted hate is simple: it is a show for the fans and playerbase of Kantai Collection. \\n\\n\r\nKancolle is only available to play in Japan and it would make sense why almost no one in any other part of the world likes the anime. There are some like me who have done the necessary requirements to be able to play the game outside of Japan, and as an avid player and follower of the fanbase I realize this anime would look like something that was haphazardly thrown together. It is extremely surprising that they would actually do a dub for the show, as most of Kancolle's players are situated in Japan. To a dedicated Kantai Collection player however, this anime is a godsend to the fanbase in so many areas. \\n\\n\r\nLets begin with the game, and why it makes the anime so good. As stated before, there is almost no gameplay in Kancolle. The majority of the fun comes from collecting the over 150 fleet girls.  As an admiral, the best part of the game is collecting my ship girls and getting to know each and every one of them. Yes- each ship girl has their own personality. Though some are generic anime stereotypes, it is still fun and exciting to meet the many girls and witness their characteristics and varying personalities. Every admiral grows attached to their shipgirls, and the game even allows marriage to them. When watching the anime, we are finally able to see our favorite shipgirls and theyre personalities in action, from Naka's mini concert to Kongou's burning love, and even to Sendai's spastic love for night battles. After interacting with the girls for so long on a computer screen, it would make sense that longtime fans would be in an uproar over seeing their favorite characters and how they act on TV.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the best things I commend Kancolle for is the fact that they gave all the original shipgirls in the game a cameo in the anime. Whether it be as a main character, a character in a battle, or someone in the background, every original shipgirl was in the anime. It is very nice to see that Diomedea was able to give the luxury of seeing all the characters the players have grown attached to in the show.\\n\\n\r\nNext is the artstyle. Kancolle's artstyle varies heavily due to the many artists employed. Some of the characters who were released at the start of the game have VERY low quality artstyles compared to characters that come later on. Fubuki, Akagi, and Kaga are prime examples of this. They're artstyle is amazing in the anime compared to how they look in the game. Much more detailed hair, eyes and features are much more clearer than on the game, making the characters really appeal to those who care very much for their ship girls. Even characters whose artstyles aren't that bad look amazing in the anime, such as Nagato and Mutsu. \\n\\n\r\nThe story of this anime can be seen to most people as quite lacking, though this is far from the case. The anime puts context to the game. When beginning the game, you are literally thrown in without having any context of what is happening AT ALL. I believe without a doubt almost all of the people who have scored low for this anime and given it bad reviews are regarding it solely as a military anime. This is not true. As Kancolle grew, it became widespread in many areas, including manga, light novels, and such. Though the game focuses solely on combat, most other media like the manga make the franchise out to look like a slice of life. This is the missing part that most people forget. Kancolle should be regarded as both a Military AND a Slice of Life. The manga and other media tell the tales of the girls at the naval base- doing their own things, interacting with each other and the admiral, playing, and having fun. Those who say that the anime \"doesn't have enough battle scenes\" don't recognize that Kancolle is not just a mecha musume anymore, but a slice of life about the naval base as well. For example, the Fubuki Ganbarimasu! manga tells of the training the new shipgirls undergo when they reach the naval base. This is the plot of the beginning of the story for her, a part that many find boring.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the anime caters to the player fan base with many small nuances. Almost everything from the game is present in the anime, from one time use items, to character poses resembling their damage states, to the formations. Its the small things that the players notice that make the anime enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nSo in retrospect, this anime does not deserve the hate it has been receiving. If you get the chance, look at game play, read the manga, get invested into the Kantai Collection franchise for a couple of days before diving in, because instead of falling in love with the characters and such during the anime, being to like them beforehand, so you can really see how the game and manga influenced everything that happens in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem is that everyone is judging the show because they have no idea what is happening.\\n\\n",

            "content": "First the whole show will likely be of little value to anyone who is not already a fan of the game.  The level on which the show is most effective is fanservice, and I thought it did work rather well in that regard the world and characters were true to the game.  The question is whether it needs to function on any other level and if it matters that other aspects suffered for the sake of fanservice.  I don't think so.\r\ntl;dr: For Fans.\r\nSo there is a story.  It's there, but it hardly matters.  I suppose there are nods to battlesin WW2, if that gets you going, but the characters tend to be more important than the overarching plot, and there are problems there, too, but I'll address that later.  I think the final resolution to the plot works, for the most part, but the worst moments in the show are probably attempts to advance the plot, create drama, or build stakes.  The show works best as a slice-of-life where sometimes the boats shoot somethings, and I think the episodes that worked best did not have a ton to do with the main plot.  The curry episode, or maybe even Kongou and Yamato's episodes are examples of this.\\n\r\ntl;dr: barely matters\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are probably one of the show's strongest aspects, but there isn't really anything done with them that we haven't seen before.  Perhaps the biggest problem with the character is that the show throws a lot of them at you, more than could possibly matter and more than the show could have time to really flesh out.  Even some of the characters that do matter, like Kongou and Shimakaze, don't receive much development.  If you're a fan of the game maybe that won't matter.  The portrayals of the characters are true to the game.  That said there are characters that do develop over the course of the series.  The pairs of carriers have a relationship that develops a bit over the course of the show.  Fubuki is all about that ganbaru thing that we're so used to seeing in anime.  Nagato and Mutsu's relationship is in the background, but I enjoy the way it develops, and the ultimate pay off was one of the most satisfying parts of the show.    On the other hand there are characters that just don't work.  Mostly Mutsuki.  Mutsuki was the worst.  \\n\r\ntl;dr: Mostly fine, but maybe only if you already know the girls.\\n\\n\r\nSome slightly awkward CG aside Art was good.  Some of the girls, like Fubuki, looked better in the anime art style.  I don't think I ever thought a girl just looked worst.\\n\\n\r\nSound was fine.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, as a fan of the game, it was a fun show.  The characters and setting were right.  I got to see some of my favorite girls do things.  Mutsu did Mutsu things and it was great.  I think it succeeds where it matters most, and where it was intended to work, which is fanservice.  If you're looking for anything deeper you probably won't find it, but ultimately I don't think it needs to be anything more.  I'm satisfied with what it is and I'm looking forward to seeing more of my favorite girls, Jun'you, in the next season.",

In this crazy show, each character has the fire power of a battle ship, and they go to seas and battle enemy ships. Along with that it also has funny moments in between the battling. This show is based of of a video game, but even if you have never played the game the show can still be fun to watch. The show as designed to be silly and fun, and in no way supposed to be taken as a serious series. The beginning of theshow was just as silly as I'd hoped it to be, it made me laugh and enjoy the characters. As the show continues the jokes begin to be a tad bit more serious, making it so you can enjoy a character for what they are. The music and the sounds were outstanding, the music really brought out the naval combat, as well as the sounds bringing out the action. Lastly, the show was entertaining all throughout the twelve episodes, I was never bored at any moment of the show. In the end, I enjoyed every bit of the show for what it was. I would highly suggest going into the show with the mind set that this show should not be taken seriously.",

            "content": "I came to know the existence of this anime for the famous ~poi ~poi craze going on. Of course I was also drawn to the girls fleet and was wondering what the hell is this KanColle all about.\r\nWell, to be honest, I did not have these pre-requisites:\r\n(1) knowledge on WW2 Japanese warships-hence, I don't understand most of the significance of the names of the battleships until later on. I thought I would be just fine not knowing them but I guess it kind of defeats the purpose for the writer to go ahead and name the girls based on the Japanese warships.\r\n(2) I don't playthe KanColle game-the KanColle game so far is only in Japanese. Otherwise, I would be interested to play it. Hence, it's hard to understand at first what's going on as you see people shooting arrows and shooting aeroplanes appear or even how the guns got attached to the girls, I mean I just don't get it.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, I hate all the characters except for the poi girl(Yuudachi). As for Fubuki, I can't say I enjoyed her character development that much. I don't know why but she just doesn't click with me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you are like me, feel free to skip this anime. It's a bother to actually want to know more about this anime if the publishers themselves make a lackluster effort in introducing this genre to new viewers like myself. However, if you have been following KanColle closely, I do believe you will enjoy this series. Otherwise, this anime is one to forget and ignore. only come and watch when you do have the time.\\n\\n\r\nPS: The art and sound(voice acting) was the only highlight of the series. There will be a sequel and I will be watching it only because I want to watch more of poi~",

I honestly think that 12 episodes  were a bit too short due to the large amount of shipgirls that are in the game and the plot rushed a bit. It was great that they gave a spinoff on episode 6 to give a break on all the drama and action. This is the reason that made me into this game and one year, still enjoying the game along with the anime.\r\nStill can't wait for season 2and the movie :)",

            "content": "Before I start the review, I'd just like to state that I have no previous knowledge of Kantai Collection, so this review is going to be based solely upon the anime TV series with no background knowledge of its universe.\r\nPresentation: The anime presents itself exclusively with moe girls. At first, making wonder about the existence of males.\r\nAs the anime progresses, we come to find that these girls and women are based on ships. Although they look like ordinary human beings, these moe girls ultimately possess battleship properties such as resting, sinking & etc (to sink means death).\r\nThe characters for the most part are one-dimensional besidesour main protagonist. They don't develop much even though it is fun to watch them interact with one another.\\n\r\nThrough interacting with different people, hints of development occur for main protagonist Fubuki. We get to watch this character through her experiences. The show attempts to show us her motivation to keep us interested in who she will become. The other characters.. although is a joy to watch, don't go through any development.\\n\r\nMutsuki, the girl with redish hair and squeeky voice, is one of the more important supporting characters whom has significant interactions with Fubuki. Sometimes Mutsuki feels lost when Fubuki is caught up in herself. But for Fubuki, it's as though she can't help it; she's weak and all she can do is to work hard, always thinking that she's not enough.\\n\\n\r\nI guess I could say that the story in KanColle is basically this sequence of events that has little strings attached. It doesn't have a main plot that is spread out throughout the entire show. Each episode seems to have its own plot. So what does that mean? It means that the anime is unpredicatable; which is a good thing in its part since its a Slice of Life. But what it also means is that there isn't a concrete goal in what the anime wants to achieve by the end of the series plot-wise. For example: I would have liked to see more into who the enemy are and what was the story behind why our characters are fighting their enemies. This is never touched upon.\\n\r\nHowever, all in all, I realize that that was not the goal of the story. The drive of the plot is focused towards allowing viewers to see the world of KanColle from the eyes of our protagonist Fubuki. And I have to say, I quite enjoyed her journey much.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is superb and very beautiful. I could just kiss it. Everything from the beaches that they're on to the ocean and the environment felt organized and understandable. Even the food looks delicious, poi.\\n\r\nThis part comes to preference: the animation switches to CGI/3D-ish when our girls are on water or have their gear on. I was a bit surprised at first since switching between the two on the go was new to me. After a while however, it felt like a nice little gimmick.\\n\r\nPersonally, this anime's art is so beautiful.. it could partly be the reason why I enjoyed this series so much. In other anime, concrete is so saturated. Here... you can just breathe with all the vivid colors and scenery. KanColle is a very colorful anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe music can be pleasant. Often times, it attempts to fit the moods in the anime, and manages to do this well whether the tone in the episodes are meant to be sad, happy, or serious. I also liked how some OST's are oriental inspired. Sound in this anime is complimentary, but not memorable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: The amazing art and sound knows how to tone in coordination with the scenes; you really get a nice feel of night and day or how Fubuki feels.\\n\r\nThe show is really good in what it does. It's very organized in its moments and it makes sure not to mix these moments. You can really relate with Fubuki. How she's new to the whole world is a nice introduction to anyone who wants to delve into the world of KanColle. Because seeing the world from her perspective is like seeing it from your own.\\n\\n\r\nScore Variations:\\n\r\n4 and less (not recommended viewing) for those who are disinterested in the world of KanColle\\n\r\n5 or 6 (possibly recommended viewing) for those who are interested in the world of KanColle",

The game lines reference is overused and everything seems to be so out of place and has no flow. \r\nThey obviously set out to make this anime aimed at those who played the game which they just did that. So if you aren't a fan of kancolle this anime is not for you, simply because the anime is targeted at those who are interested/ playing the game and not for casual anime viewers.\r\nNow should you watch Kancolle? The answer is simple,if you are one ofthe people who are playing the game, this might be for you. However If you are here looking for some good anime, with good plot, good character development and awesome story. Unfortunately, this is not for you. Simply because the story literally has no plot, just like in the game, where the girls keeps on going to do operations after one another and capture new islands. \\n\r\nAs the story goes on there will probably be alot of new ships being introduced to us, now if you haven't played the game at all you will probably have no clue who those Kanmusus are. there won't be any major character development since the game itself has over a hundred ships, with a variety of classes etc.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is based on real life WW2 ships, with some ships involved in warcrimes during WW2. This time Japan and Germany (Germany is in the game) are like the good guys who fight against the Aliens to protect humanity. Now where did the Americans go? Perhaps they all end up being the abyssal fleet since all the battle that took place especially events are based on IJN vs USN. Don't take it too offensive though.\\n\\n\r\nthe anime could have been better unfortunately it did not meet many people's expectation therefore as a result is a failure in many people's eyes.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: I would not recommend this anime to those who have never played the game before/ have no interest",

            "content": "One anime that has been a hype for the Winter Season has been Kantai Collection, usually shortened to KanColle.  The anime is based on a game of the same name which involves using battleships that are given the female gender targeting the \"moe\" aspect of anime in my opinion.  This review would be based solely on the anime experience without knowledge of the mechanics and the storyline of the game itself.  \r\nStory - 6\r\nYou could say that the story was less interesting compared to the art, animation, and sound of the anime.  \r\nIt follows the storyline of \"Main character meets senpaiwhom she tries to catch up to, trains hard and suddenly gets noticed by senpai, joins senpai on a final mission, and they succeed.\"  What's so different about the plot is that by the last few episodes of the anime, there was this forced idea injected into the characters that was nowhere to be seen during the first half.  Although it is implied that there are many mysterious things that are happening.  Overall, the story was average without real plot twists and a hell lot of Yuri moments.  \\n\\n\r\nLooking at the flow of the episodes, one filler episode could be seen halfway that sorta shifted the momentum into a slower state but prepared the introduction of a thrilling arc.  \\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation- 9\\n\r\nDiomedea has been a studio that produced very fluid animation effects.  Now, given the complexity of the idea of the anime, I can say that they delivered pretty well.  There is no mistake that the characters are all beautifully drawn.  All of them have their own appeal and have typical aspects that a moe character should contain.  The involvement of planes, cannons, bullets, and torpedoes still continued my amazement with the anime's art.  I can say that KanColle has one of the most amazing art and animation for the Winter lineup.\\n\\n\r\nSound- 9\\n\r\nOpening and ending themes have always been an integral part of the anime.  And I can say that KanColle has an amazing soundtrack.  Bullet sounds and torpedo sounds are as close to the real deal as they can get and I have no complaints with the sound quality.   Given the nice art of the anime, the sound did not fail me as well.  One of the best opening and ending themes for the season.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- 7\\n\r\nThe characters of course are a major part of the anime.  And this anime has given the characters specific attributes that make it hard to forget them.  I have never seen an anime that put together a lot of individually based speech disorders and mannerisms in different characters.  Well, they  really aren't speech disorders but I like to call it that.  There may be appeal in that but it sort of annoyed me halfway.  A few of those were Yuudachi who always ended with \"Poi\", Naka who is the self-proclaimed idol of the fleet, Akatsuki who is obsessed with becoming a lady, Kongou who gives the Japanese language slang due to her British vibe.  I swear, each of them has this unforgettable attribute that could either annoy you or make them cute in your positive.  Props to their voice actresses for their skill and talent to create personas that are hard to forget.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 8\\n\r\nI can say that I enjoyed the anime despite it giving me a bad impression halfway due to the lack of its content.  But then again, this isn't one of those anime that you hope to have a very deep plot.  You can't deny the fact that the anime delivered well in terms of action, suspense, and a little bit of drama.  I'm not a particular fan of historical and military themed anime but I have enjoyed this.  I am not aware whether the game has a similar plot or what, but this delivered a statement on how the game may be engaging as I suspect it to be.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- 8\\n\r\nPersonally,  I don't think that this would be an anime that you would really want to finish in an all-nighter due to the lack of a well-defined plot.  Given the fact that all the characters are very attractive girls, I guess it can capture the male audience easily.  \\n",

            "content": "Being original doesn't necessarily mean its noteworthy. Such is Kantai Collection.  It's premise may seem absurd but that hasn't stop millions of fans of playing its game. Due to this popularity, it was adapted into an anime a lot of hype was placed on it. Here I am to see if that hype was worth it.\r\nSTORY:\r\nThere's really nothing much to say about the story, since it's not meant to be taken seriously in the first place. Despite the theme surrounding the show being all war-like, the story usually leans to the slice-of-life genre and therefore, all the drama, all the friendship, all the funand enjoyment going on and not giving shit about the war that's plaguing their seas. Anyway, what I do like about the story is how the naval battle scenes are referenced to real-life events such as the Battle at Midway, if I recall correctly. Also, the story has some dark-theme to it and I was surprised to see one of the fleet girls actually die and how it affects the other characters.\\n\\n\r\nAnywho, if you are familiar with the game this show is based on, you probably already have the gist of what's to unfold here. If not, you'll probably get lost. The producers did throw in some originality of their own in regards to the storyline but they seem mostly to appeal to the moe-ness of the characters. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\r\nIf you can name any famous World War 2 IJN battleship, expect them to be present in the show, cutesy and battle-ready and all. By and large, KanColle has a huge roster of characters in the video game, but in a show consisting of only 12 episodes, only handful made the cut to be animated and given character. \\n\\n\r\nThe main character is a destroyer named Fubuki. Despite the show trying to make her as interesting and lovable as possible, in the end I don't see Fubuki as an interesting main character. Her personality is generic and while there is a sense of character development, in the end it all falls flat. That said, the side-characters seem to have more personality than the MC. My personal favorite, and probably some as well, Kungou, a hyper-active, tea-loving, Engrish speaking battleship; her strong personality even matches her raw power as a war machine. There also exists Yuudachi, who always ends her sentences with a \"poi\", and that's it. \\n\\n\r\nAside from all these, these characters were carefully made to match that of their real-life counterparts. For example: battleships and air-craft carriers are personified as more mature women, in contrast to the loli destroyers and dreadnoughts. To give them some variety, some characters have their own special personality while others just seem to fade in the background.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, it goes without saying that the clothing of most of the characters seemed skimpy and impractical for battle and even everyday interactions. This is mostly for the fan-servicing and while that surprised me, in my eyes it's not really a welcoming sight for the most part. \\n\\n\r\nAESTHETICS & AUDIO\\n\r\nBefore it started airing, the visuals is where most of my worries lie for the show. Diomedia is in charge of the animation and by basing to their previous shows, I was rather skeptical about the resulting quality of KanColle. Fortunately, I was rather surprised and impressed of how the studio kept everything consistent for the most part. Overall the visuals were decent and the characters designs were faithful to their in-game counterparts. The fast-paced scenes were exchanged for CGI ones and while some scenes may make it look quite out of place and awkward, for the most part it did it job decently. \\n\\n\r\nThe outlying soundtrack is also good, fairly complementing every scene. The opening and ending themes were good, despite sounding quite generic. \\n\\n\r\nFINAL VERDICT\\n\r\nWhile KanColle's appeal mostly apply to that of those who have invested into the video game, I for one, think that KanColle is an interesting concept. One thing it has going for is its huge roster of colorful characters, if some of them are not as interesting as others. While presentation is quite mediocre and predictable, I can see some direction going for it. I also applaud it for having a second season in production already and I'll be glad too see how it presents itself once more.\\n",

            "content": "Should you watch Kantai Collection?\r\nWell, do you like ships? Do you like all girl casts? Do you like WHAP? Do you like shipping girls (pun not intended)? And do you like selecting waifus? \r\nIf you answered yes to these questions, KanColle is the Anime for you. But let's go deeper.\r\nSo Waifu Collection, I mean Kantai Collection, was based off a free to play brower game by the same name. The game followed the WW2 Japanese pacific naval campaign and the female analogues of the ships, with the player in charge of maintaining and managing the fleet. In the anime however, the pacific war against theallied powers was dropped in favor of a war against unexplained Davy Jones abortions. In KanColle, there is an abundance of unexplained or questionable adaptiation choices of the source material. Another example is how in the game, the admiral is never shown for the purpose of having the player better picture themselves as the admiral. However, in the anime, the admiral is kept hidden even though there is no reason to project yourself as the admiral (unless Kongou is your waifu).\\n\\n\r\nFor plot, I give it a 2/10. The best word I can use to describe the story is unfocused. This anime has so many different plots and themes, that the show has a hard time expressing any of them fully and ends up with a very forgettable storyline. In it's 12 episode series, it manages to include themes of death, survivor's guilt, maturing as a woman, determinism, and friendship, while managing to not go farther than introducing each concept. When watching this, I didnt know what to want or expect from this anime. Was is supposed to be just about Fubuki just becoming a better person? Is it about fitting in? Are the Abyssals going to be significant in any way? Is the Navy sexist for only enlisting girls? We don't know. Without a central plot, it lacks that feeling of satisfaction that the climax is supposed to give you. In most anime, when you see the protagonists finally reach their goal or complete their journey, the definite and conclusive ending is probably the most satisfying moment in the story, being able to either make or break a series. It felt like I was reading a book where I can't tell the difference between the protagonist and antagonist. I couldn't feel committed to any of the characters as the story was so unfocused. While there are shows that handle multiple plots fine, this anime fails as there is no central arc or theme that ties all the subplots together. Shows like Assassination Classroom is an example of how a story can follow the unique plots of multiple characters well by having them all work towards a common goal. Bakemonogatari is an example of how theme can tie plots together, where all the different arcs were unified by the common theme of trying to escape or fix events in your past. KanColle had no way of showing how each episode adds to each other, making the show easily forgettable. \\n\\n\r\nFor Art, I give it a 8/10. If thought the 3D animated scenes were well blended into the regular art style of the anime and I liked the visual execution of the aircrafts.\\n\\n\r\nFor Sound, I give it a 7/10. The music was pretty mediocre and didn't stand out as particularly poor or particularly good. Poi.\\n\\n\r\nFor the Characters, I give it a 4/10. Like the story, it seems as if the anime is more interested in seeing how many characters it can introduce rather than how well they can develop them. Basically the Batman V Superman cameo feeling.\\n\\n\r\nSo, should you watch KanColle?\\n\\n\r\nNo. Honestly, High School Fleet does a way better job with executing the Naval fleet girl premise.",

Isn't perfect but, is very well done, excellent drawing, nice characters, and is not pretending to be something else, simply is a good slice of life with adrenaline and shoujo ai, you're gonna enjoy with Akagi and Buki and all it takes be a little hero in the seas, battles between ships witha brilliant variety, so much fire, good funny scenes and not lame at all. Is almost like a perfect balance between Strike Witches and Girls und  Panzer, is really worth to take a look.",

            "content": "Alright, this is gonna be a hell of a longgg ride. Beware for spoilers.\r\nNow, I have known KanColle for about a year now. I started when the Shimakaze hype is on its peak. I was just like, 'who the hell is this exhibitionist?' and got myself into KanColle.\r\nSo if you're not familiar with the game, it's a card game made by DMM and Kadokawa Games. It has a record-breaking amount of players when it has just been released. I, unfortunately, only got the chance to play it late 2014. But I have quite the experience in the large and immersive fandom. It has a wholeLOAD of merchandise; from the Weiss Schwarz deck, to the figures, to the gachas and MILLIONS, wait no, BILLIONS of doujin merchandise. \\n\\n\r\n[Story - 5/10]\\n\\n\r\nAs an avid fan myself, I was disappointed by the anime's story. It has a lot of fillers and it was just, I don't know? Inconsistent is the word I guess. I can't even begin to explain. It started well and action-packed. I was dazzled by episodes one until five, but that's where it went downhill. After the fifth episode, it's just inside jokes and stupid fillers and pure fanservice. The pace wasn't balanced, and I have to rewatch it about three times to get the whole thing. The eleventh episode was a letdown, since it feels like a rushed episode that didn't even make the climax more exciting. The 12th episode? Oh come on. That was the WORST. Starting from the nonsensical abyssal evolution to the really bad animation (exclude that Nagato fighting scene) it was the epitome of how badly made it was. Plus SPOILER ALERT! the story felt as if Kisaragi sunk for nothing. \\n\\n\r\n[Art - 6]\\n\\n\r\nThe art wasn't really that enjoyable to me. The characters are fine and all but the 3D CG and the explosions really bug me.\\n\\n\r\nSeriously, that 3DCG sea was horrible. And don't even start with the 3D character animations. //shivers\\n\\n\r\n[Sound - 9]\\n\\n\r\nThis is probably the most enjoyable part of the anime. From the adrenaline pumping opening theme Miiro to the exciting Fubuki, it can be easily said that the music was quite a masterpiece. The ending made us excited about the next episode, and the opening is just plain awesomeness. Don't get me started on the orchestral BGMs. The music is probably the only reason you would want to watch this show.\\n\\n\r\n[Character - 8]\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were quite memorable. But, some were out of their original concepts. Like, Nagato, a caring girl in the game with passion for leading the  fleet, the perfect lady. In the anime, she is shown very strict. Way to go Diomedea, you just ruined my favorite girl. Other than that, Yuudachi and Kongou was just memorable! Ooi and Kitakami's lesbian scene were also something.\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment - 7] \\n\\n\r\nI can't say a lot about this topic. It was good and all, but it doesn't really etch into my memory like Death Parade or Binan Koukou Chikyuu Boeibu LOVE!\\n\\n\r\n[Overall - 6]\\n\\n\r\nBad story, inconsistent pace, lazy animation but godly music and memorable characters. It's not quite worth your time, except if you want to waste your life watching cute girls making curry and being gay to each other.",

No humanly interaction with the enemy and not much information about them either.\r\nIt's one of those 100% girls anime, and because of that,it doesn't make a clear contrast between being rude and nice.\\n\\n\r\nI think the whole idea behind this series is funny.

            "content": "As a fan of the games of Kantai Collection I was actually very excited for this anime series, and yeah, this review is coming after the anime ended. And yes I finished the anime in winter. In fact, I will say that I did a review on YouTube episodically. I thought about writing a review on the series to give a full insight of it. Not in a positive mode but not in the negative mode. Of course yes I enjoyed the series, but it doesn't equal a great show overall. \r\n*SPOILERS AS WELL (maybe) RIGHT DOWN IN THIS ANIME REVIEW, DO NOT READ FURTHERFOR INFORMATION IF YOU HAVE NOT WATCHED IT*\\n\\n\r\nStory: To start off, I'll be completely honest with the story wise of the series. I would be biased but I like the story of the series as it did not went very well. Yes, the art seems very weak in my personal eye because it felt like a lack of execution or at least a lack of presence for the first 3 episodes of the cast of characters. The series tries to make you also feel bad for someone in the series but it lacks a lot of presence, making the story of the anime seem lack luster and moreso a little bit forced at the start. The second issue I had with this anime was the first person perspective of the series. If you do not know what I mean, a first person perspective its more like Sleeping with Hinako. The game pretty much is that. You are the admiral and your job is to make new ships, new equipment, heal, etc. But in the anime series however You are supposedly the admiral, yet you're not doing anything. That doesn't work in anime format because #1 you're not ordering anyone, #2 its very annoying when its referring to you when you're the viewer. You're watching the show. You're not pushing the buttons like a Fire Emblem Game. That was the biggest pain in the butt for the series because for me as a viewer it feels underwhelming. The third issue is that at points they lack to explain the stuff related to the series itself, like for example their materials, the Kai Ni (they don't explain that much, they show it though). Thats not a big issue but the other two were the only issues with the anime story line. Now lets get to the pros of the story line. As I said from the start, it had a weak and poorly executed start. Then after a little bit of time it did actually become a big stronger because due to special episode to characterized some of the cast of characters and their bondings. Along how they work together as a whole. The show works well with that. Unfortunately though... the characters are the problem with the series. But in the end the story wise of the anime is decent. Its not terrible however its not great or fantastic looking.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: This is the weakest part of the anime. Why? There's a big reason why am I saying the anime's issue is the characters themselves. There are over more than 200 girls in the actual game! From them, many made a lack of relevance to the story, and many felt like useless. Only the cast that took the most roles here in the series were at least relevant to the series. Which honestly I will say thats my only issue with this series. But other than that the girls got characterization, and a few of them got character development. Does that make the cast terrible? I don't think so to be honest. I mean many got what I have stated in the story wise category and also part of the characters category, but its very jarring to even include the other characters to make no relevance at all to my eyes.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: This is one of the strongest areas at least to a degree from the anime series. This anime was made by Studio Diomedea, and to be honest they made over 3 other shows from what I know in the winter. They made Fafnir, World Break and Cute High. By comparing the quality of the art between the other three this was the highest budget used from them from the winter season. It looks very nicely done and I love they kept the anime designs from their respective or the game designs. The animation is done very smooth and nicely, but behind that I have an issue. The CGI girls. Alright. Im not saying that the CGIs are terrible, they look decent enough, but when you use CGI with 2D designs in a fight or in a middle of a battle, that looks ridiculous. Its stupid enough to at least make CGI but come on. You could have made 2D on all! But overall, the art/animation is good enough by the standings.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: The part that makes the show very entertaining would be the music itself. Its not memorable to be honest aside from the Opening and Ending, but its very catchy and well done for the series since it does fit rather well with each single scenario. That was done very well done. From OP and ED, they're great as well, they're catchy as hell and yet I can't stop listening to them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Even though with the flaws of the show, I personally think that it was very fun to watch. The slice of life moments worked well for me and yes, I did had fun with it. I can't deny that I enjoyed the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 6.6/10 (Overall it gets a 7)\\n\r\nIts a decent show that its would be for fun and games, entertaining and very nice to have at least a feel of action too. But if you don't like moe girls, slice of life combined with military, I wouldn't recommend it But if you like these, give it a shot.",

The art-style is really well done and I gotta say, the fight scenes with 3D animation are incredible, It's rare to see such a good CGI in an anime. The characters are super charming and most of them are great, even tho they left out lots of awesome ships from the game. The music in it is priceless, from the epic opening to the background music during the fight scenes. And the way they fight, holy shit those cannons dude.\r\nEven if you don't like warships or military shit, check KanColle out, It's fucking rad as allhell, plus, It has a lot of waifu material.",

            "content": "I'd like to first say, getting to see my fav KC waifu animated isn't exactly the most thrilling experiences of my life so to say. It was a more, cringe-y, excited feeling and I was more or less like 'WTF IS HAPPENING XD'. \r\nI will be referring to the game a lot, since I am a player of KC. I am though, a bit passive on it tbh. Much like CoC players. (Waiting Simulator; 2015)\r\nThose who are like \"Eh, TL:DR\", please, ctrl+f the following for the TL:DR review:\r\n- TL:DR Story\r\n- TL:DR Art\r\n- TL:DR Sound\r\n- TL:DR Characters\r\nAnyways, Kantai Collection. Those who know and play Kantai Collection(KC) should know what the characters are like in the game. Each 'ship', so to say, have their own set of lines that they utter during for example, combat, or idling as your secretary. My problem is, how hard the animators tried to incorporate said lines from the game, into the anime. I love it when Kongo screams \"Burning Love!!\" when firing shells at enemies, IN THE GAME. In the anime however, it feels so horribly out of place. Not to mention how the Kongo class battleships were portrayed in the anime. Gehh. \\n\\n\r\nJumping ahead, the story. It only really deserves a 6 in my opinion. They try really hard to make the anime as much like the animated game as possible. Those who again, play the game will also wonder how the admiral has certain ships that are a b**** to get in the game. Not to mention, the game once in a while, hosts events that are correlated to actual events that occurred during WW2. TL:DR Story - The anime pulled one of the bigger events from the actual game and animated it. How it looks and feels to those who don't play the game, I'm not sure. But, those who play the game like I do, will probably make little sense of it. \\n\\n\r\nThe art gets a nice 7 here. Again, referring back to the game, the characters that portray the different warships are often done by different artists. Even some characters that receive their Kai-ni (Upgrade), sometimes or rather, most of the time get their in-game art changed rather drastically. For example, Hibiki kai receiving her kai-ni to become Verniy. Her art changes. (Not an anime spoiler, chill). Back to the art, it's a refresher for me, to be honest. Coming back to the game to play day after day and seeing the small amount of progress and then comparing it to the mountain of exp you need to remodel them is a pain in the a** really. So getting to watch this anime and see what they did with the characters is a nice breather. TL:DR Art - It's a nice change of pace to players, and personally, I don't have much against it even if I weren't so used to the in-game art. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound also gets a 7. The in-game sounds are so repetitive that I just mute it because f*** me if I'm gonna sit through 3-2 grinding with it. Also, in-game music is the same. For the anime though, there are multitudes of different sounds and music that -kind of- bring the anime across to the audience. There are few, if no times where the anime wasn't moving forward. The music enriches and enhances the anime and really helps it move along. At the same time though, there are one or two times where the music didn't help create the atmosphere needed to for example, present a big, bad guy. A lot of cheery bits, really. A LOT, of cheery bits. TL:DR Sound - The anime's music and sounds are a massive change of pace for players of the game, at least that's what I think. If you don't play the game though, it's still really good. One thing I wish they'd add though, the groaning of metal once in a while would be nice, for example, when they're evading, or getting hit. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters in this anime, I have to give a 9. It's my biased point of view, and I refuse to change my scoring of it for any reason at all. My reason for giving this anime's characters a 9 is, simply, because I finally get to see the KC girls become animated. I was pretty hyped when they announced the anime was finally going into making. If I were unbiased, and watched this from a point-of-view of someone who hasn't played the game, there really is very little character development at all. The primary characters, sure, get a bit of development but it doesn't really go far at all. I get a sense that this anime was made to satisfy the hunger of KC players who wanted to see their premium ship waifus become animated. I am, sadly, a part of that group. TL:DR Characters - Fantastic to see them become animated, really. My only wish would have to be to give them each a better background and development. Really, some pretty important ships in the game become background characters in the anime. It sucks. (Here's to wishing your favourite waifu is animated.)\\n\\n\r\nI didn't enjoy the anime as much as I wish I could've, so I give it a 7. I'm not exactly saying that it was s*** either. It was fantastic fun to get to watch the girls become animated but at the same time, I was bummed that they didn't have their original art from the game. I understand that it'd be pretty out-of-place if their art styles differed from each other, so I'll leave it at that. One final thing that really kind of gets me in the nerve. The planes that the carriers, aviation cruisers, etc, are piloted by 'fairies'. Google 'Kantai Collection Fairies' for a preview. Their little chibi characters with slits for eyes and are about only as tall as your hand. Back to the fairies. They are the ones that fly the aircraft presumably, because even the PV of the anime showed so. Right about now, you're probably thinking, 'Oh, what a cute little addition they added!'. Then, you see the aerial combat of the anime and watch as the Zeroes and Torpedo Bombers get shot down by those alien things, THEN the realization hits you. I'll leave it to you to imagine what's happening inside those cockpits. TL:DR Enjoyment - Pretty fun, though the anime does sometimes slap you in the face with hidden brutalities the animators stealthily hid this 'cheerful' game adaptation. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, 7. Really. I've not much else to say about it. My point of view on this anime would really differ from those who didn't watch it but then again, there are people who play the game like I do and just give it a straight 10 because it's an adaptation of their 'assumable', favourite game. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Kan colle, this anime was interesting, it literally felt like a Pok\u00e9mon episode sure it was enjoyable if you look at it from a general standpoint but if you look closely its flawed and at best at average (from someone who really enjoyed it but knows to put unbiased opinions on here) \r\nthis anime on the one hand it\u2019s one of the few anime that I have recently decided not to be a slice of life moe school life comedy, personally I found this anime to be fairly good because moe battle ship girls and that one voice actor that plays Karen from Kirkino nomosaic is there. But that is being very very very biased, and my raw score on the actual quality of this anime is a teacher grade of 76/100 (US schools) taking out all my personal feelings about this anime and putting it raw, from a plot standpoint this was quite a average anime it feels for the most part like a Pok\u00e9mon episodes\\n\\n\r\n-Story 5/10, or 50/100 (F)\\n\r\n the story/plot revolves around well there is not much cute moe battleship girls and lets just throw in some abyssal demon girls as the antagonist and no such thing as backstory just here is why they are fighting because they are fighting something. Now the main idea or moral of the story is basically something out of Pok\u00e9mon, something along the lines of a Pok\u00e9mon wanting to evolve into a stronger form to be the very best, and not losing sight of your friends. Actual storyline is basically nonexistent however this was kinda meant to be a casual anime. But it still has quite the handful of feels.\\n\\n\r\n-art 8/10\\n\r\nThe artwork of kan coll appears to be heavily influenced by its roots to its internet game, because yes cute moe battleship girls that get stripped of clothing as they get damaged because JAPAN, anyways the artwork from it is decent nothing too amazing it doesn\u2019t suck however the effects appear to be some crafty work along with all the turrets that the battleship girls have seem decent.\\n\\n\r\n-sound 8/10\\n\r\nIm not really sure but it seemed alright, the battle girl ships use the same weapons over and over again so I guess having that as a constant is nice, voice acting was decent average all around.\\n\\n\r\n-Characters 6/10\\n\r\nWell the characters get very well defined into their general character categories, from determined im gona do my best and never give up naurto attitudes, to territorial yuri girl, as well as the just there for someone to be sad (that one girl from DRRR that is in the hospital\u2026) nothing real special going on here. \\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment 8/10\\n\r\nSure this was a average anime that was on the borderline of being terrible, but deep down I wanted to watch this because of moe battleship girls, sure sometimes I was talking to the screen saying don\u2019t do it why are you about to throw away your life for a stupid upgrade, and other times he JUST DO IT shia labeouf speech could be herd in the background of my mind as I criticized the anime but I did not waver from my task of seeing this to the end because I kinda wanted to know a little.\\n\\n\r\n-Overall 6/10 if you put it all together\u2026\\n\r\nThe only thing holding you is the pre season hype about battleship girls, and personal intrest if you have no intrest in the thought of battleship impersonations as anime girls then there is almost nothing in this anime for you \\n",

The only bad art is the abyssal enemy ship girls that look like fish girls that have cannons on them. The CGI is noticeable but its only during the battles but its not to terrible. \r\nSound 10: Music is amazing \r\nCharacters 8: Each girl is different and has their own personalities. Each onehas their own responsibility at the district such as being a teacher, training for battle and managing the girls and the district. They also have their own special abilities in battle because each one is a different ship such as Fubuki being a destroyer, Akagi being an aircraft carrier, Kongo being a battleship, Atago being a heavy cruiser, and Kuma being a light cruiser just to name a few of them. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8: Everything about this is enjoyable besides the CGI effects. Its a really good slice of life anime with a military theme to say, but even though there's a war they didn't try to kill of any of the girls.\\n\\n\r\n Its a watch in my book",

It can be so dark, but overall this anime serve better as slice of life story than act as action anime. You have many unique character, and it can give audience more interest.

            "content": "I'll start this review off by saying I'm not really breaking new ground here telling people what they already know, that this show isn't that good. So to somewhat be a contrarian for the sake of making myself seem more important, I'll state that I think there are more problems with the show than it just being a bad adaption of a browser game story or being too literal of an adaption of said story and thus displeasing \"mainstream\" anime audience goers in favor of diehard players of the game. I actually think the problems with this show runs much deeper than that. Well... Asdeep as a show about animu girl warships can be, which is about the depth of a bowl of ramen, but still I think this is worth examining because I have literally nothing else to do with my time. \\n\\n\r\nFor those who don't know Kantai Collection or Kancolle is a browser game that got adapted into an anime. The incredibly deep story of the show is that warships which are represented by human girls are fighting an unknown threat called \"Abyssals\" that come from somewhere deep at sea and start attacking coastal cities or something like that. The abyssals are also animu girl warships but they're made to look just evil enough to make your brain connect the association between evil and this \"character,\" but not enough that you would find them unattractive. I mean let's not get crazy here. The cliche nature of the story becomes apparent really quick, but even that isn't why this show ends up being bad either. Before I get into why I think it ends up being bad though I want you to imagine for a second what a show like this could do to milk content for it's story, and by that I mean a story aiming for mediocrity and not something even aiming for anything close to being good let alone greatness. The way I see it there are about four easy ways this show could have milked some easy content out of it's initial premise:\\n\\n\r\n1. It could focus on the relationships between the characters and/or their own internal(self) conflicts.\\n\r\n2. It could focus it's content around the cuteness of the girl warships and layercake the fanservice. \\n\r\n3. It could focus it's content on the strategy of the ship battles or more generically on the action therein.\\n\r\n4. It could aim especially low and go for common tropes in similar anime shows and genres.\\n\\n\r\nWell to a certain extent you can say it attempts some of each of these easy ways to milk content, but what I think the true failure of this show is and what makes it bad regardless of it being a game adaption is it fails to really live up to any of these four easy ways of making a show like this work. So lets examine each one and see how it didn't quite live up to it's premise in these ways, I mean if you want to I guess. \\n\\n\r\nTake most basic writing courses any where and one of the first things you'll learn about writing a fictional story is that characterization is key and by that, if you want your story to feel real you have to have your character's doing believable and relatable things within the context of the story they're in and on top of that they have to have personality's with traits and quirks that also make sense within the context of a story. There are other aspects to writing a story sure, but generally the characters desires and their actions are what drive a story, so this is a pretty important thing to get right. If I had to say it tried to live up to any of the four things I listed above it would be this one and by that I mean they tried to make the shows main drive the characters and their conflicts between each other, rather than rely on most of the other aspects of this premise. The problem with the characters in this show though is that none of them act or behave the way they should given the situation that they're in but it's actually worse than just getting things wrong because I would say another major problem is that despite their clear leaning on character conflict to drive the story is the sheer amount of character and character buildup they omit and leave undeveloped. \\n\r\n\tLet me give a minor spoiler as what I'm about to say happens in the first episode, a character dies. As expected other characters respond to this characters death with sadness, but the sadness of her death doesn't really make sense in a lot of ways. The show like a lot of badly written anime has a tendency for being overly dramatic and it is never quite as well illustrated as it is with this early death. One of the characters is almost catatonically in denial about the other girls death for over three or four episodes. Now maybe the two characters are really close... But we're never shown that. This is another problem I have with this early death in this show and a trope I have noticed in a lot of eastern media I call \"Tragedy in an instant\" we're expected to feel the weight and emotional seriousness of a tragedy with people we have no real connection with yet and don't really know about the connections of to really feel anything about. Now it's possible I'm just not empathic enough and everyone else on earth feels intense sadness over random instantaneous fictional deaths of characters, I'm admitting there is some subjectivity here to say the least, but I think that even if you want an abrupt early death in a show there are ways of building up emotional weight and a feeling of loss for that character and I simply think this show failed to utilize any kind of emotional depth in trying to get us to care. I don't know why this character should matter to me other than in the most abstract ways possible. The bigger problem though is that it doesn't really make sense for the characters in universe to care as much as they do either. Now keep in mind my stating of the initial premise these girls are warships fighting a supposed large mysterious existential threat that might very well be the end of their civilization and yet they seem not to be familiar with death or it's consequences in this universe. The problem with this shows character's then is that it required more gritty and battle hardened people than it had, but it didn't want to go that route because grittiness and realism has a tendency to nerf the \"sexy\" cliches they're trying to paint by numbers into this plot like naive and happy go lucky girls. People that are constantly being attacked by a threat tend to not be very happy go lucky or naive, they tend to be filled with trauma, anxiety and are more settled into being \"prepared\" for a threat then they're trying to live a regular every day life. They also have a coldness towards the death of those around them, because they have seen it happen before, so they know to stay just caring and detached enough not to mourn everyone like it's the first time. Consider the denizens of other shows with a similar premise to this like Evangelion or Attack on Titan, in both shows a mysterious threat has started attacking people from some unknown point of origin and the attacks are constant and vicious and whatever else you or I might have to say about those shows in the positive and negative, the one thing I think they both did right was the characters personalities reflect the harsh circumstances they're in and by extension the whole of the shows societies and world seems geared towards surviving these threats. This is one of the major ways in which Kantai fails big time. There is an \"abyssal\" sized divide between their personalities of the characters and the way their society is structured and the seriousness of the threat they're supposed to be facing. \\n\r\nA person defending this show might say \"Well of course it isn't like those shows, it's not trying to be that serious!\" I can agree to an extent that not every show with this type of premise has to be extremely serious or gritty and the scenario I outlined above is not the only one an anime or fiction in general has to take. In fact I can think of a lot of Anime shows that manage to balance a similarly serious premise with light hearted tones and comedy rather well. Hunter X Hunter, Gurren Lagann and Detective Conan come to mind for me and I can list a lot of others, the problem with Kantai isn't just that the serious moments aren't taken seriously enough. It's that there isn't enough (good) comedy and the light hearted moments are bland or nonsensical given the characters and the situations they're in. One of the only episodes that isn't just about the ships doing lame ship and game related things is about a curry contest... Now taken by itself it's not the worst premise for a random episode of a Nihon cartoon to have. The problem is this is about the only thing we ever see them do aside from swimming for no reason before a battle and swimming for no reason before a battle and feeling slightly sad, swimming for no reason before a battle and trying to get an unused powerful battleship to swim with you and then swimming for no reason before a battle and asking questions about the \"admiral.\" I can imagine humanoid ship women doing a lot of things, I can even justify some of the overuse of swimming and ocean related scenes with no purpose given their ship nature, but the \"curry\" episode being the only only odd episode out where we see them doing anything else just illustrates the absurdity of the whole premise to an absolute boiling point. Either make it consistently about these ship women and their struggles in this \"war\" or use everyday tasks like a curry episode to illustrate differences between their personalities and push the war much further into the background. Make the show much more light hearted and less centered around the games threat and mechanics. If they wanted the show to be more about the girls personalities, more anime trope like episodes like a curry contest should have been employed here to illustrate these things. Instead what we get in lieu of that is pointless bickering, snobby and tsundere ship women denying the obvious usefulness of other girls in the fleet and not an interesting personality or arc of development among them. Instead of using the curry episode to develop the characters more it's yet another opportunity for this. In an even slightly better show an episode like that might show that one girl is a perfectionist in her cooking, maybe to an absurd point where she takes instruction so literally it still ends up tasting bad. Maybe by contrast another girl is a heavy improviser and the making her curry shows she's a heavy experimenter and less regimented in her ways. Maybe another girl is sloppy, maybe another girl is like me and she is just notoriously bad at cooking no matter what she tries. Maybe the food, spices and compositions of the curry can be reflective of the girls personalities.  What I'm trying to get at here was even this stupid premise could be utilized to show some of the personalities of characters and move the plot forward here, the problem with this show as this episode especially illustrates, is that it likes to accomplish nothing at light speed. We learn nothing more about the characters that we didn't already know from this change of pace and setting that we didn't from all of the other more ship oriented task episodes.\\n\r\nEvery time I think I have hit upon what truly makes this show bad we reach another bedrock of a lack of quality here, but I think now we reached the final depths of the bad writing and that's that the characters aren't developed enough in general. You could ignore the rest of what I said in the paragraphs above if the characters on their own were well developed and interesting despite their lack of consistency with the setting, the lack of consistent tone and strong establishment of emotions, despite the poor utilization of the situations given etc. The problem is even if we put all that aside, the characters and their core motivations just aren't strong enough to carry a show. So we have a main character named Fubuki, a character who to the shows credit is new to this world and they try to make her a lens by which we come to understand the world of Kantai or at least this was what they could have done with this character and I think they were mildly attempting to do so. The problem is she just reacts so stupidly and haphazardly to everything around her that I can't really imagine this is what I would be like in this situation. So right off the bat we can't identify with the main character of a show... Her personality is also not markedly differently enough from the other girls to warrant her being a POV character for the audience. Most of the girls have the same'ish bland slightly happy personality. We meet one or two tsunderes and even they aren't extreme enough to play off most of the shows poor characters. People complain that the show has too many characters and I think that could be the reason for some of the shows problems but the real problem is that we don't have a cohesive few characters we follow and see developing character arcs and traits develop for over the course of the show. There are other shows with a gigantic cast of characters that still make you care at least a little bit by showing how they relate to the main characters. All the characters in this show relate to Fubuki by virtue of the fact that they're another ship and their personalities aren't developed much or utilized to tell us anything about her or themselves in any way other than that. So the number of characters isn't the problem, it is the poor execution in using them that is. \\n\\n\r\nA lot of blood and ink is spilt around the idea of \"fanservice\" and whether it is moral or not and whether it is good content or not, regardless of it's moral character. Whatever you may personally think about that, in a browser game and in an anime show centered around girls like this the appeal of fanservice to a large part of the audience is undeniable. I mean let's get real here folks, You either really like warships to watch a show like this or because the majority of the audience is not military enthusiasts I'm guessing you like women in skimpy outfits. I'll be flat out honest and say what drew me initially to this show was seeing pictures of the characters and I wasn't admiring their battleship parts, well maybe just a little, I mean those guns... That embarrassing bit of trivia aside, unless you happen to be a  dead serious military strategist who can somehow get over the fact that the ships are animu girls facing each other, the appeal of them being cute girls is going to have more to do with you wanting to watch this for most people, and I have to say on this front the show is a disappointment. I've seen shows with much better stories, that don't need the filler content of women tripping over their own shoe so they can show a pantsu shot that still had more fanservice than this show. So in the most rudimentary way a show like this could give you even the most basest of pleasures and filler content it manages to not really do much. There are a few basic scenes of them in bathing suits, a bath area where they repair themselves and a few random excuses for extravagant outfits, but I think a person would reasonably expect a lot more than what you end up with concerning this if you have watched any similar anime and know absolutely anything about the culture of it. I'll have more to say about the lack of variety concerning this show and outfits and changes of setting later, but the main point you should note here is, is that even the most basic clich\u00e9d worthless and lazy slice of life/school club type of show does more with that than this show does.\\n\r\nThere is a somewhat bizarre scene where one of the ships is being tickled by some invisible hands that I'm assuming is a thing that happens in the game, but the way it's shown it just ends up looking more weird and contextless than funny, sexy or whatever tone they were trying to convey with it. Which is another problem with this anime in general, the attempt to make the girls look sexy sometimes but they don't actually do anything that would constitute being \"sexy.\" Now I guess there is a subjective threshold here and some things that might be intended to be a specific tone or way just might not resonate with me for whatever reason. For example I really like the show Cowboy Beebop and despite really liking the character and them doing rather obvious scenes with her that were intended to be fan servicey for their time I never really found Faye Valentine all that sexy or sexually appealing for some reason. I'm not exactly sure why nor do I think going on this tangent would be very fruitful or important, but what I know about Beebop that I didn't necessarily get any vibes or intentional nods to from Kantai was whether they're even trying to entice people with their fanservice. At the very least with Faye her writing and characterization was clear enough that I could tell what they were intending to do that with her and not intending it with other characters even if their intentions didn't work with me in this particular way. As I said in the first section the characterization and the animation in Kantai don't really convey an intentional tone or idea of what we're supposed to think of these characters and the situations they're in most of the time and this broader problem is the best illustrated by their lack of an attempt to even appeal to us in the easiest way possible and when I think they were trying they still failed.\\n\r\n\tWhile I'm loosely talking about aesthetics, I'll say that the animation is pretty average, it doesn't do anything really bad and it' doesn't do anything extremely good. I'll say in it's slight favor that unlike a lot of crap anime shows it never starts getting confusing with it's editing and it's action scenes. Conversely though nothing is very visually exciting and basically no risks are taken. I will say to the shows slight credit that the characters are represented well from what I know of their illustrated versions in game and there aren't any obvious messups like some animes do with weird disjointed spike hair, eyes too big or small for a face or tube leg/arm syndrome. \\n\r\nI can also say that I honestly don't remember the music on this show at all, if it had a soundtrack it had no impact on me what so ever. A sure sign that anime show is bad is that when people go to praise the characters they instead start praising the voice actresses non-stop and forget about the characters themselves. Well fair enough to them ladies eastern and western they tried their best but this writing like a sinking ship was unsalvageable. \\n\r\n\tBefore we move on I'll just say you can condense and formulate my whole brilliant argument of this particular section and possibly my dislike of the whole anime down to one simple complaint, THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY HAMAKAZE, WTF? I MEAN WERE YOU EVEN TRYING? SHE IS A SILVER HAIRED ANGEL SENT DOWN BY THE WAIFU GODDESSES TO SINK MY DISGUSTING BATTLESHIP OF A LIFE. JUST ONE SCENE WITH HER WOULD HAVE SAVED THIS, I WATCHED THIS WHOLE DAMN SHOW AND SHE COULDN'T EVEN SHOW UP ONCE? COME ON... Alright back to our regularly scheduled programming. \\n\\n\r\nLets talk about the third way in which this show could have been good, which was focusing on the strategy aspects of the ships and or more generically the combat. You do see some combat in the show but as I already stated they aren't very visually interesting battles but that kind of underlies a broader point that the action in the show is just kind of bland and not very immersive. I think the blandness is easy enough to explain, there are many anime action shows and many with better drawn and more carefully orchestrated battle scenes than this show. The ships are just mostly depicted moving fast and every once in a while they scream things or an explosion occurs. A lot of battles end with crappy deus ex machina situations where a new squadron of ships or one previously unknown or unused powerful ship comes and saves the day relieving all tension the \"threat\" might have had otherwise. Repeat this ad infinitum and we have ourselves every action scene in the show. The lack of immersion comes into play because the threat never feels like a real threat and the battles never feel like a real battle because they lack real action and what they really lack in this department is strategy.\\n\r\nThere aren't scenes of the ships really strategizing or talking about naval strategies, it's easy to forget they're in a war in this show about ship girls being in a war. The best we get is a few \"practice\" scenes scattered throughout the episodes that don't really show them doing anything other than splashing around in water here and there. The ships sometimes talk about \"group composition\" and things like that but during a battle none of this is really utilized well or a elaborated on. I haven't played the game, but based off the show I'm assuming it's either a really rudimentary strategy game or a \"card\" game that plays out like a strategy game anyway. So what this show needed was scenes where we see the ships doing serious formations and step by step attacks against the enemy. Like having the fast ships and submarines scouting in the front and long range but slow attackers in the back, carriers and midsized ships in the middle. Basic stuff like that to establish that are protagonists aren't complete morons and have some basic knowledge of their capabilities and an idea of what they need to do to \"win.\" Girls und Panzer is a show very similar to this one structurally in a lot of ways and while I also didn't think that show was that good in strategy and action regard at the very least we see them talking about tank strategies, formations and the use of their specific tanks and abilities in battle. They understood how to utilize the absurd premise of their show at least a little bit better in this regard. We never really get that with Kantai most of the show is again about dumb luck or zerg rushing your opponent. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Girls und Panzer(GuP) another thing this show could have done that I would argue that GuP did was utilize the tropes in it's genre to help manufacture an obvious plot and trajectory for the shows story. GuP was about a school tanking club and by tanks I mean military tanks. \"School club\" is a well worn path in anime and GuP manages to use it to create a structure of competition and some of the obvious drama that can bring. Like sibling rivalry, the rivaling schools international compositions and personalities, the nature of things school clubs do for their school and their own sake ETC. Have an episode where they go on vacation for no reason and where they have to raise money to keep the school club in existence and congratulations you made yourself school club anime number 11473456 slated to release next fall. Kantai doesn't really have a similar obvious structure to appeal to, it's an action show but it's not really about action so it doesn't aim for those tropes much. It's about girls doing things, but they don't really do the typical things done in an anime like this, which might be good in a well written anime because that could mean it's bucking trends and stereotypes, the problem is it's not really replaced with anything here, it's just a lack of any kind of content at all. It doesn't really have a typical school or office setting you can milk material from either, the back drop is just kind of scant in general. I'm not sure exactly what the world is like outside of these girl ships on an island. For all I know the rest of civilization is doing fine and the abyssals are only attacking this one crazy rich admirals island. Alternatively these ship women might be the only humans left, making this one of the bleakest dystopias ever penned to paper... The problem is we just don't really know what the hell is going on with this universes premise and doesn't even aim for lazy tropes and cliche elements as filler and structure, it's just a big pile of nothing folks and I'm stepping in it. \\n\r\nThe animators of this show really seemed to want these girls to swim, so how about a few \"beach\" related episodes? They could play volleyball, they could have a swimming competition, they could have a swimsuit competition, they could go fishing, they could swim with cute sea creatures, they could have an episode where they find coconuts and two of the girls drink from them and talk about their lives and the nature of the universe. The point is even if we take the most obvious tacts and cues ever from just what's on this island we can imagine at least some rudimentary things for them to do other than the nothing that they end up doing. I think this is the single biggest factor in this shows failure, a lot of bad anime shows can still be liked by at least a few people by coasting on cliches alone, but truly bad anime like this don't even attempt that. This is a really special failure in that regard. I don't even like most of the school club/slice of life type anime I have seen but even most of those have better filler content than this. Or at least more effort was put into their lazy premises than this. \\n\r\nThe one cliche this show did rely on quite a bit was the \"love and team work conquer all\" nonsense. It just further illustrates the laziness of the show and how it failed especially hard for reasons 1, 3 and 4 on my list. It deflated the need for strategy, the girls having personalities or real relationships with one another and destroyed the need for us to care at all about the battles and the broader conflict the show was trying to convey. Guess what they win in the end, happily ever after, thank you and good night. \\n\\n\r\nThe problem is, the problem is... ThE pRoBlEm Is. THE PROBLEM IS. I got as sick of writing this sentence as you probably did reading it. I mean I apologize with the repetitive nature of saying it so many times, but... The problem is so much just went so wrong with the show that I felt compelled to say it ad nausea. I thought it was starting to become a nervous tic and had to slap my hands and face a few times from pointing out even more problems.\\n\r\nYou want to know something I don't know a whole a lot about? Anime. I mean that in the sense that I probably know more about it than the vague idea of an average person in the west, but in the grand scheme of anime fans my knowledge is small pettanko's and I still have a lot to see and learn about. Two things I do know a lot about though or at the very least I have much more knowledge about in comparison to anime are video games and films. I have played an ungodly number of games and reviewed far more of them than I have shows here and I have watched almost 2400+ films according to a site where I track the obsessions that fuel my mental illnesses not unlike this very website we happen to be on. So in a Venn diagram between these two subjects we have film adaptions of video games and games based off films, in both cases we have a long history of tragedies and sadness. It isn't easy to adapt something from one media to the next, not every story is translatable. On the other hand I think people are too quick to assume the \"obvious truth\" that a book, comic or manga are superior to their \"dumber\" counterparts. There's a kind of elitism to media that something on the written page is more legitimate because it spells things out more and has more opportunities to expound upon things than the budgets of most shows, anime, movies and games do. There is a similar elitism about games being inferior to film and television. I don't always assume these things and I can think of specific examples where I definitely think an adaption improved upon it's original written source material. I'm saying all this to reiterate what I said at the start of this review, that I don't think this being a \"game\" necessitated this anime being bad. Just because something often happens to be the case, doesn't mean it necessarily had to be true here. The Persona and DanganRonpa anime while not particularly shining examples of the broader media of animation were still pretty good adaptions of their respective games stories and in some ways made more sense and laid things out in a way that were more understandable than the games themselves. I can also imagine someone who has no familiarity with their games enjoying those shows. I at the very least after watching them didn't feel like they wasted my time. What Kantai should have ultimately done was establish the girl warships as real people in their setting and expound upon their personalities and their ship nature in the ocean battlefields and in a few typical anime situations. Aim for mediocre and that's what we could have had here. The problem is it couldn't even rise to that meager level of an adaption improving on the source material on a browser game. So the problem is... It's just not good. I still love Hami though. \\n",

            "content": "(DEWAYNE\u2019S NOTES: JUST A QUICK AND KINDA BAD REVIEW BECAUSE THIS SHOW DOESN\u2019T GIVE ME MUCH TO SAY. I JUST HAD TO WRITE BECAUSE WRITING IS ALL I DO AT COLLEGE AND NOT EXPRESSING MY OPINION DRIVES ME INSANE. ALSO I HAVE NOT PLAYED THE GAME, SO DON\u2019T HASSLE ABOUT THAT.)\r\nWe all know that cute girls doing cute things has pretty much been consistently popular in anime since Kyoto Animation made it their selling point back in the mid 2000\u2019s. Now I shall shamelessly admit that I love this genre as much as the next guy, but there has been a longstanding sentiment that peopleare starting to get tired of it. So that\u2019s why it seems like there has emerged a reactionary subgenre of cute girls doing decidedly uncute things. Whether it Gen Urobuchi mercilessly killing magical girls in Madoka magica or moeblobs in MUTHAFUCKIN TANKS in Girls und panzer, it seems the optimal way to refresh the formula was to take it to the EXTREME for all the jaded otaku tired of seeing girls drinking tea and/or crying with planet sized eyes. \\n\\n\r\nI imagine it is such a subgenre that led to the creation of today\u2019s subject, Kantai Collection(or Kancolle). Adapted from a game that was apparently very popular and produced by an animation studio only really known for the highly controversial Kodomo no Jikan, Kancolle tells the story of cute girls\u2026. who are also ancient Japanese warships! The show tells us that \u2018Fleet girls\u2019 are girls who have been born with the souls of ancient warships, and that they are needed to fight a mysterious race of sea demons called \u2018Abyssals\u2019. We follow Fubuki, a destroyer that has recently arrived at a naval base ready to fight. \\n\\n\r\nYeah.. that is actually the premise. This may be where the first problem lies, a game doesn\u2019t really need a believable or even consistent premise, but an anime series does a lot more. Then again, Kancolle, with its mixture of cool fights and comedy, perhaps doesn\u2019t want you to take it that seriously, which is acceptable. The main plot is a mixture of naval action and slice of life elements. This is a combination that I personally adore in a show but I have to question whether it was pulled off effectively here. \\n\\n\r\nIt moves slowly at first, letting us get to know the characters and mechanics, and following Fubuki as she learns more about her mission and attempts to grow stronger. However, just once it gets up to speed, the show throws filler episodes in the mix, which while entertaining, did not bode well for a 12 episode series. The mix of slice of life and action has to feel natural and not like the creators decided to suddenly switch gears because they thought you were getting bored. This harms the pacing and makes it harder to care about what it going on in the long run. Another thing is that in the show\u2019s downtime, the comedy and character interaction isn\u2019t all up to snuff, meaning you\u2019ll often be wishing for something to happen. \\n\\n\r\nWhen the action scenes do kick into gear, they can be pretty tense, and the stakes are clearly shown, with little plot armor or deus ex machinas being used to cheat their way out of a fight. Despite the fact that we never really learn anything about the abyssals, they are pretty menacing and make for some good fights. When it comes to the drama, the show does make a good effort in attempting to get me to care, but these elements were too lightly spiced onto the mix to be effective. Things like Mutsuki\u2019s arc from episodes 3 and 4 and Akagi\u2019s arc near the end are able to shed some light on the characters and give us some reasons to care about how they fare in their fight against the abyssals, but not enough focus was given to this for it to be a prominent part of the show, as it was diluted by mediocre comedy and boring character interactions. Overall, this leads to a show which is entertaining, but lacks the tools to be truly engaging.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are many, and as such I forgot who many of them were. There is Fubuki\u2019s squad, the other squads, the carriers, the higher ups and many more. I will give the show credit in managing to cram so many distinct characters into a measly 12 episodes, but they pay a heavy price for doing so. If you can keep track of these characters, you will pick up a surface level understanding of who they are, but that is exactly ALL you get, never does the show have time to dig any deeper into these ship girls. When the show uses its characters for some good drama(like in episodes 3+4 as I previously mentioned) it can be fairly competent but most of the time it doesn\u2019t bother. This leads to many of the characters being pretty one note and bland. Fubuki is the spunky but shy protagonist who will keep training until senpai notices her, Mutsuki and Yuudachi are just ditzy best friends, Akagi is a wise mentor with a troubled past and Kongou is completely insane. If the show had more time or less characters, maybe this wouldn\u2019t be a problem, but it is as it stands, and a fairly damning one too. \\n\\n\r\nThe character designs and setting are mostly pretty dull, you can sometimes get confused which characters are which because of the multitude of them present, but the show at least tries to give unique designs to each girl. But hey it's what you expect, long flowing hair, school uniforms(for some reason?) and big moe eyes, but lacking in the originality or distinctness that make good moe designs. The animation is unsurprisingly kept to a minimum for the most part and movement is pretty limited(this is moe, who needs movement?). The exception to this is pretty obviously when the show wants to wow you with its gun porn.. I mean fight scenes. Here they pull out all the smooth water animations, gun animations, torpedo animations and EXTREME WIND BLOWY HAIR MOVEMENT. But this is to be expected from a show of this nature, and its not like it looks Ufotable or Madhouse levels of extreme sakuga usage. \\n\\n\r\nMusic is pretty chill, but it doesn\u2019t really have anything to compliment apart from the fight scenes. The music for most of the SOL aspects is just your usual light sounding tonky lounge music that usually is meant to compliment the comedy and light tone, which doesn\u2019t work here on account of how boring these scenes are. The music in the fight scenes is of the \u201clet's use an orchestra to be all dramatic\u201d variety which is a shame because the game has face melting guitar as its battle theme from what I have heard, so why couldn\u2019t we get some of that? The opening is also a fairly dull song, apart from the hilarious misheard lyric of \u201cWANKERRRRRRRRRR\u201d and I don\u2019t even remember the ending so it can\u2019t have been great. \\n\\n\r\nOne thing I will say is that the voice acting is pretty impressive, mainly because many of the seiyus portray multiple characters, and manage to give them all distinct tones, which in moe is no easy task. They appear to be really TRYING to make the show more funny or dramatic, but sometimes it is the tools, not the workman at fault. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion this show is either a heavily botched game adaptation or just a really boring moe show, it's dull and predictable but I honestly can\u2019t say anything worse about it. You can tell it attempts to be something but ultimately cannot save itself from being nothing, the curse of bad moe shows if you will. Come to think of it, why did I even review this? they say mediocrities are the worst thing for a critic, then I guess that makes me some kind of intellectual masochist.",

In fact, the opening is one of the best things about this show.\r\n     The references and story within really add to the emotional impact it leaves on the audience. Good Originality is hard to find these days, but it is great in thiscase, and for this reason it is rated 8/10. Oh, and the actual anime is okay, too, I guess. 3/10.",

I wrote this review for those who basically not play the game and newcomer who want to know what moefication is.\r\nThis anime performing ship girls (kanmusu) that fight against their enemy called Abbysal fleet. Ship girls are moefication character that adapted from World War II warships, especially form Imperial Japanese Navy. When first time I watched this anime, I didnt even understand what kind of anime is this. Some girls fight against monster onthe sea. But then I realize that this is a slice of life anime that focus on a new special type destroyer(moefication version of course) that join on a naval base, while she is never join a battle.\\n\\n\r\nThe character development is some kind of point of interest here, where an unskilled ship girl what to become just like her friends. She kept training every day, hoping some day she can fight in the same fleet with her admired seniors. So you can enjoy a lot of motivative quotes from this anime, then change your view, maybe.\\n\\n\r\nOne that I didnt understand when first time watched this anime is... WHO THE HELL WAS THE ADMIRAL? \\n\r\nIn this anime the admiral's face not shown and we wont know if the admiral is male or female. Then after I played the game, I know the admiral was WE. Yes, we whom organized the naval base in the game. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime used 2 kind of animation, 2D and 3D animation. 3D animation used for the battle scenes, and the other just like anime in general. \\n\\n\r\nI belive many people love the opening song and so do I. MIIRO by Akino from bless4 was very macth the concept of this anime, the the ending song, Fubuki by Shiena Nishizawa, if you search for the lyrics you'll find that its contain the names of Fubuki-class destroyer.\\n\\n\r\nThe story wasnt highlighted here.\\n\\n\r\nOverall maybe for those who have played the game before they would be upset. But for who not play the game yet, you will learn many kind of motive for your life that maybe good for you",

            "content": "Creating a story out of nothing is never easy, but that isn't an excuse to try everything at once. \r\nKantai Collection tries to do too many things at once and ended up with nothing. It's like the idiom, Jack of all trade but master of none. Kancolle tried to tackle multiple genre but succeeded in none.\r\n[[Note: Spoilers might be included]]\r\nPersonal rant below\r\nKantai Collection, or Kancolle for short, is an attempt by a company to create an anime out of a game just like Hollywood creating Dragonball Z out of Dragonball. An attempt to make something that is \"original\" yet \"fun\" but ended up failing atboth. The problem is that Kantai Collection tried too hard to do everything.\\n\\n\r\nI am speaking this from someone who plays the game, this anime is horrible if it is trying to teach a person about a game. This isn't like Pokemon, where the earlier episodes managed to tell you what the Pokemon is along with its mechanics.  If they are trying to explain about the game, they'll need to make the anime more \"militaristic\" as that's what Kancolle is: A spreadsheet simulation with naval battle theme. Or at least try and explain, even if it's crazy (e.g. Bucket bath), some mechanics in the game. Kancolle didn't do any.\\n\\n\r\nThe story clearly shows that the directors don't know what path they want the anime to go with. It's like watching an indecisive kid.  It has a mix between slice-of-life and comedy with an underlying \"seriousness\" smashed into each episode somewhere near the end just to try and remind the viewers that the story is still serious. \\n\\n\r\nNow comes the part that is probably the reason why they continue watching Kancolle: CHARACTERS. Oh boy! Look at all these waifus you can get. But jokes aside, these characters and set-up are a mess. You have the main character that seems to always get the center-of-attention and get out of trouble (Fubuki), the comic relief (Yuudachi), and the try-to-be-serious-but-isn't (Mutsuk). Kitakami and Ooi are only there for daily lesbian service and all other characters are forgettable. How forgettable you might ask? Enough that they added another character at the end and you don't even know who.\\n",

At least they kept green buckets.\r\nCharacters details: In anime tkanmusu don't carry thier gear on surface, but in game kanmusu do. Though Anime Admiral is typical KanColle weeb.

            "content": "I began to watch KanColle when it was airing, and then dropped it until it was fully released.  I decided to do a review of the anime as a stand-alone media type, or rather a perspective from a first time viewer with very little knowledge of the game.  \r\nAs a standalone anime it is fairly mediocre but still entertaining, like Strike Witches, Girls und Panzer, and Sky Girls, this anime attempts to mix moe girls with machines drawing fairly niche audiences and rampant skepticism from onlookers.  \r\nIt has several major downsides however, which makes this anime more niche than usual and directedtoward players of the game.  \\n\r\nFirstly the large cast of characters can be difficult to follow, especially since there is no singular naval uniform or main cast (aside from Fubuki and her roomies).   I feel the scenes with the main character interacting with most of the fleet were a little unnecessary, or at least should have had cute introductory captions for each character introduced to Fubuki (see the Negima anime by Shaft).  Over the show you come to grow attached to characters, so it doesn't feel lacking in main character development, but certain groups of ship girls are recurring on-screen without proper introduction or screen time (like the Heavy Cruisers, you know that one blonde one with enormous... guns..). \\n\r\nThe second major problem lies in the 3D graphics as well as the visual inconsistencies in the anime.  Let's be real here, the 3D looks atrocious next to the hand-drawn anime, and was much less noticeable in Girls und Panzer, and was completely accepted in Expelled from Paradise (which is all 3D so you just gotta suck it up) but in KanColle it's easily noticed and looks like it was made in MMD.  They could have easily come out with an OVA with amazing battle graphics, but instead went for the 12 episode with okay graphics.                \\n\r\nMy final complaint is a nitpicky one about the anime continuity, which could probably be easily explained in the game, but again this review is from the viewpoint of the anime as standalone content.  This part contains --spoilers-- \\n\r\nThe equipping of the ships is seen as purely mechanical, except for the few times when it's not?  Example, when Akagi equips and then her arrows magically appear in her quiver.  Or when Fubuki is trying to get Yamato in the water and all of a sudden she is wearing her  rigging.  Or, when Nagato joins the battle in her rigging only and suddenly she has her full guns?  Small things like these just don't make sense when they make a big point of the girls getting ready with the assistance of machines.  Strike Witches also had the magical and mechanical element, but it was very clear what both elements could do.  --end spoilers-- \\n\\n\r\nOn the whole, this is another mediocre anime that is still entertaining enough to watch the whole way through, but if they wanted to make it more open to non-game players they should have reduced the cast and clarified the world better.  If they only wanted it for the niche players, they really should have just gone all out and done the beach training episodes and justify to themselves moe ships.",
