            "content": "Please note that this review is intended to be read by those that have finished watching Comic Girls and while care has been taken to minimize story related spoilers there may still be spoilers within character analysis. You have been warned. \r\nCute Girls learning to overcome their problems and flourish as true manga artists by bonding, having fun and living the life of a high school girl as they confront their struggles together as friends and fellow professionals. \r\nBased off a popular 4 panel manga of the same name Comic Girls is a comedy and slice of life anime that gives us the rare opportunityto see what the life of an aspiring manga artist is like and the kind of struggles that they have to face as they try to balance their personal lives with their professional careers. The first episode of the series made a pretty good impression on me and did a great job of hooking me as I was curious to see whether Kao\u2019s would be able to fit in a dorm and live alongside fellow manga artists her age and learn from them to save her career as a manga artist over a period of just one year. I'm glad that I decided to watch the series right to the end as it was a series that I really enjoyed watching.\\n\\n\r\nTaking place in modern day Japan the overall story of Comic Girls follows the life of Kaoruko Moeta a shy and timid high school girl and aspiring manga artist that thanks to a series of disastrous manga sales is forced to attend a well-known manga dorm for female manga artists in an effort to improve her manga drawing skills. At the dorm, she meets a number of fellow manga artists who while working in different genres of manga all share a passion for manga that Kao\u2019s can relate too. These include the kind and older sister like Ruki, the energetic and positive Koyume, the tomboyish but confident Tsubasa and the quiet and eccentric but surprisingly understanding Fura. As Kaoruko lives and interacts with this colourful cast at the dorm and at school Kaoruko would soon learn that being a manga artist is not just about trying to imagine an idea that you have never encountered or experienced before but rather its about drawing in ideas that you yourself have enjoyed doing with the friends that you have befriended and bonded with. One cannot draw a manga until they have experienced the scenes that they want to draw with their friends. \\n\\n\r\nKaoruko \\n\\n\r\nKaoruko played by new seiyuu Hikaru Akao in her first main role as a seiyuu is one of the main characters of the series and is the series main protagonist. A high school girl and an aspiring manga artist at the beginning of the series Kaoruko better known as her pen name Kaos was a nervous and mentally fragile girl that had very low self-esteem and was very weak to any form of pressure. While passionate towards manga and a relatively hard worker Kaos was hampered greatly by the fact that she has yet to experience the scenes that she draws in her manga panels which ended up causing quite the negative feedback from her readers as to them her scenes were unrealistic. As a result of this Kaos was given the opportunity to move to a female dorm designed specifically to allow female manga artists to focus and improve their skills. As a result of her low self-esteem and nervousness, Kaos at the beginning of the series had some trouble fitting in at the dorm and had great trouble in befriending her fellow manga artists who were the same age as she was due to the fact that until now few people had been nice to her. In line with this fear is Kao\u2019s belief that she is merely a background character when compared to the results that have been secured by others the same age as her. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series goes on, however, Kao's personality gradually changes as a result of her new-found friendships and bonds with her fellow manga artists and dorm mates. As a result of being able to not just form friendships but also experience the very actions that she will need to draw within her manga panels Kaos was able to realise that no manga artist is ever alone and that the best way to improve your skills as a manga artist is to first improve yourself and secondly experience the very events that you are drawing into your manga by living a life as an actual high school girl. While still nervous and timid to a degree Kaos becomes determined to change herself and live the life that she had been missing and draw what she experiences into her manga. While Kaos in the beginning of the series was hesitant about helping her seniors within the dorm as a result of her determination to improve herself this fear of the unknown gradually vanishes and she becomes more earnest and willing to help others as well as developing an interest into finding out why someone is acting the way that they are with this latter one being more prevalent in her interactions with the dorms resident horror manga artist Fura. The character of Kaos I felt was an interesting character that was both well designed and developed. Seeing Kaos transform from a quiet and meek girl that knew nothing about what an actual high school girl\u2019s life is like to one that was determined to live the life of one and use the memories that she makes with her friends to improve her skills as a manga artist I thought was one of the best things about her character. I felt that her seiyuu Hikaru Akao really did an excellent job of portraying the character of Kaos. \\n\\n\r\nRuki \\n\\n\r\nRuki voiced by veteran seiyuu Saori Oonishi of Food wars and Clockwork planet fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Kao\u2019s fellow dorm mates. A high school freshman and classmate of Kaos Ruki, unlike Kaos, is an established manga artist with her genre being teens love. A confident, imaginative and positive young woman Ruki is someone that easily fits the image of an older sister being not just kind and considerate towards her juniors but also perceptive enough to notice when something is bothering them. As an experienced manga artist Ruki knows very well the types of challenges that aspiring manga artists face as they try to break into the industry and make their mark on it and as a result while hardworking and earnest tries hard to create the perfect balance between her personal life and her pro career all the while watching over and encouraging her kohai\u2019s. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series goes on and as Ruki\u2019s character gets expanded upon it can be seen that Ruki also has a fair share of struggles that she has to deal with. While an experienced manga artist that has already established her place within the manga industry it can be seen that Ruki has mixed feelings about this. While happy that she has managed to establish a career in a field that she is interested in it can be seen that Ruki is somewhat embarrassed about the way people see her due to the fact that she\u2019s an ero manga artist which isn\u2019t helped by the fact that for whatever reason people often see her actions as being of the lewd nature even if she did not mean it to be so. A fact that I felt was hilarious as it contrasted with Ruki\u2019s usually composed attitude. In line with this is Ruki\u2019s complex in that she is conscious of the fact that her fans would imagine her as someone that is sexy and mature when she herself is not. As a result of this fear Ruki is shown to be wary of meeting new people and would go to great lengths to stop people from seeing her work on her manga due to both her embarrassment at having others see her work and at seeing the doubts that she has regarding whether this genre is really the one that she wants to be known for. As a result of these fears Ruki was shown to have a very deep fear of book signings as she was conscious of the reactions of her fans to her actual physical appearance an aspect of her that I really liked as it showed that no matter how skilled one was at writing and drawing the person behind that can be someone that\u2019s far from what one can imagine their favourite author to be. As a character, I felt that Ruki was one that was well designed and developed with her many fears and embarrassments contrasting well with her usual calm and mature self. The older sister like personality that she exhibited I felt helped greatly in allowing her juniors to overcome the fear and struggles that they faced in making their first marks on their careers. I felt that her seiyuu Saori Oonishi really did an excellent job at portraying the character of Ruki. \\n\\n\r\nTsubasa \\n\\n\r\nTsubasa voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Rie Takahashi of Re Zero and Konosuba fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Kao\u2019s fellow dorm mates. A high school freshman and a classmate of Kaos Tsubasa is unlike Kaos and Koyume an established manga artist with her speciality being a Shonen manga artist. A hardworking, positive and kind person by nature Tsubasa is someone that while quiet is someone that is friendly and kind to everyone that she meets whether they are juniors or adults. A confident and steadfast person by nature Tsubasa on initial appearance can easily be mistaken for a boy due to the fact that she insists on adapting the guise of a tomboy to hide her true identity from her friends and schoolmates. As a result of this Tsubasa is seen by many of her fellow schoolmates as someone that is cool, focused and calm something that she really appreciates as she feels that her normal self does not fit the image of her chosen speciality. While being less skilled with words than her fellow manga artist Ruki Tsubasa is shown to be someone that doesn\u2019t mince words and is someone that can be quite direct with her praise and is always willing to offer her honest opinion on something when asked for advice by others. Despite being only a high school girl Tsubasa is shown to be someone that\u2019s mature for her age and can easily take control of situations easily someone that I really like about her character. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series goes on Tsubasa\u2019s personality and character starts to gradually change as she interacts with her friends and fellow manga artists. While a quiet person by nature as the series goes on it can be seen that Tsubasa is someone that can get really focused into her work to the point where she can actually transform into the main character of her manga via the use of cosplay a fact that I found to be really hilarious. While having a well known and popular series can often make people arrogant this is not true for Tsubasa who seems to be fine with just being able to draw manga to her heart's content showing how humble she is regarding her profession. This aspect of her goes well with Tsubasa\u2019s core belief that only by drawing the best you can, can you get closer to the idea that you want. A prominent trait of Tsubasa\u2019s character is her insistence on adopting a tomboy persona that stems from the belief that her true appearance and the one that she adapts when going back home is unsuitable and not fitting the image of her speciality. While very determined to maintain her cool and mature tomboyish side to her fans and friends this feeling gradually changes as a result of Koyume\u2019s actions that cause her to regain some of her girly spirit.  The character of Tsubasa I felt was an interesting one that was both well designed and developed with the constant transformation into her manga\u2019s main character via the use of cosplay and the hilarity that this ensures being one of the best aspects of her character. Additionally, the struggle that Tsubasa has with her family and the decision to adopt an entirely new persona to allow her to better fit in her manga speciality I felt was well done and showed how determined Tsubasa was to make a name for herself in the manga world with or without her family\u2019s support. I felt that her seiyuu Rie Takahashi really did an excellent job at portraying the character of Tsubasa.\\n\\n\r\nKoyume \\n\\n\r\nKoyume voiced by veteran seiyuu Kaede Hondo of Battle Girls High school and Girlish Number fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Kao\u2019s fellow dorm mates. A high school freshman and schoolmate of Kaos Koyume like Kaos is an aspiring manga artist that while new already has a lot of experience in the industry due to her willingness to learn. A carefree, confident and positive girl by nature Koyume is someone that can freely fit into any environment that she enters whether it\u2019s a new school or a new dorm due to her positive, friendly and caring nature. An intelligent and fast thinking person by nature Koyume though still a new artist approaches her work as a shojo manga artist with both determination and passion aspiring to be a successful manga artist within the field like her fellow dorm mates. While having a vivid imagination Koyume at the beginning of the series had great trouble drawing material for her manga due to a lack of knowledge on romance matters. As a result of this at the beginning of the series, she like Kaos were in a state where they were forced to find new inspiration to improve their skills. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series goes on and Koyume\u2019s character and personality gets expanded upon it can be seen that while confident and positive Koyume is someone that can easily get embarrassed and lose her normal composure which is best shown when discussing matters related to romance and her relationship and admiration of her fellow manga artist and friend Tsubasa. This latter interest in Tsubasa as a romantic partner is also used as a running gag within the series as Koyume has a habit of picturing her as the male in her manga stories to her embarrassment and the amusement of her friends. While possessing boundless optimism and faith in her skills as a manga artist Koyume can become discouraged if people don\u2019t like her work but this latter part is offset by the fact that her happy and go lucky attitude always enables her to return back from the brink more energised and determined than before. The character of Koyume I felt was an interesting character that was both well designed and developed with her ability to stay positive and energetic at all times to offset Kao's sudden mood swings being the best aspects of her character. Additionally, her ability to come up with random ideas and expand them into crazy scenarios I thought was something that matched well with her personality. Her romantic interest into Tsubasa was also an aspect that I liked as it allowed us to see Koyume in a rare sight of panicking in embarrassment of having a secret found out. I felt that her seiyuu Kaede Hondo did an excellent job at portraying the character of Koyume. \\n\\n\r\nSuzu Fura\\n\\n\r\nSuzu Fura voiced by veteran seiyuu Reina Ueda of Relife fame is one of the main support characters of the series. A fellow manga artist and dorm mate of the girls Suzu Fura who is often called Fura sensei by the girls due to her experience is a quiet, isolated and awkward person by nature that seemingly prefers to stay within her room instead of socialising with her fellow dorm mates. A horror manga artist by trade Fura due to her awkwardness and lack of social skills is someone that has few friends in her life due to her scary nature that causes people to avoid her. As a result of this Fura often spends long periods of time in isolation creating material for her manga. As a result of this isolation, her first meeting with Kaos was about as much as a shock for her as it was for Kaos. In line with her isolation and her speciality as a horror manga artist Fura adapts a very distinctive physical appearance of white clothing that contrasts well with her dark hair that covers her eyes. An outfit that I thought suits both her chosen field and her personality of loving to hear others scream in terror really well. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series goes on and Fura\u2019s personality and character gets expanded upon it can be seen that Fura while a scary and somewhat unsettling person to be near is actually someone that is incredibly lonely due to her lack of friends. As a result of this loneliness Fura often compensates by acting overly friendly with people that she knows trying hard to savour the warmth that comes from being near people that she\u2019s familiar with which is best shown in the strong bonds that she manages to establish with Kaos despite the latter\u2019s initial fear of her. As a result of her awkwardness around people, it can be seen that Fura has a great deal of difficulty interacting with people that she\u2019s not familiar with and as a result can easily misunderstand their actions. Because of this personality, Fura is someone that is unused to people being kind to her and as a result, she holds people that do so in very high regard counting them as one of her dear friends. When relaxed and in an environment that suits her though it can be seen that Fura reverts back to her normal personality that she keeps hidden behind her scary one a personality that contrasts a great deal with her usual one. Instead of being scary and awkward around people in this personality Fura is instead a kind, attentive and patient person that can be surprisingly talkative and is a very capable teacher that uses both jokes and scares to allow her students to concentrate more on their work a far cry from her default persona. As a character, I felt that the character of Fura was an interesting one that was both well designed and developed with the contrast between her two personalities and her gradual opening of her heart to others as she bonds with and befriends her fellow manga artists and dorm mates being the best aspects of her character. I felt that her seiyuu Reina Ueda really did a fantastic job of portraying the character of Fura.  \\n\\n\r\nAMV \\n\\n\r\nAnimation wise I thought that the dorm that the main cast live and work at and the school that they attend as students were very well designed and did a great job of showing that a manga artist is able to work from anywhere as long as they have the creative resources that they need to create their work. The character designs for the characters whether for the main cast or the supporting cast I felt was well designed and matched well with the personalities of each character. The inclusion of manga setting scenes to illustrate individual scenes within the anime I thought was also well designed and matched well with the theme of manga creation. In terms of music, I really liked the series OST as it matched well with the many different emotions and feelings that the cast experience in each scene. The opening and ending themes for the series which was Memories and Namida wa Misenai which was sung by the series main cast I felt was pretty good with both conveying a cheerful and positive mood to the listener and matching well with the series main theme. In terms of voice acting, I felt that each member of the voice cast was able to do an excellent job of portraying their assigned characters. In particular, I feel that Hikaru Akao, Saori Oonishi, Rie Takahashi, Kaede Hondo and Reina Ueda who portrayed the characters of Kaos, Ruki, Tsubasa, Koyume and Fura all deserve special praise as I felt that they all did a fantastic job at portraying their assigned characters. In addition, though I didn\u2019t cover the members of the supporting cast I also felt that Aya Endo, Minami Tsuda and Ayaka Nanase who portrayed the characters of Ririka the dorms matron, Mayu Kao's editor and Miharu who was the homeroom teacher of Kao's class all deserve special mention as I felt that they did an excellent job of supporting the main cast in this series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall conclusion \\n\r\nOverall Comic girls was a series that I really enjoyed watching and had among its strong points an interesting premise, an excellent story, interesting and well-developed characters, strong voice acting and its inclusion of real-world issues into the professional lives of the girls. \\n\\n\r\nThe premise of the show I felt was an interesting one as unlike seiyuu\u2019s and the making of anime the creation of manga and what the life of a manga artist actually is like is something that is largely unknown to us. Unlike anime and seiyuu\u2019s the age of a manga artist is hard to ascertain because as human beings our skills and our innate talents at a particular action manifest at different times and as a result it\u2019s perhaps not unusual to have talented manga artists to actually be high school freshman instead of say young adults that had just entered society. However, as a result of this unique premise of having the main cast as high school girls, we are also presented with an opportunity to see the types of problems that both manga artists and teenagers such as the members of the main cast face. This combination of having the main cast experience not just the problems that they face in their professional lives such as the dreaded slump that many a manga artist and light novel author has felt as well as more personal problems like being afraid of attending book signings for your work due to being afraid of what your fans would feel at seeing your actual physical appearance I felt was well done as it allowed us to see the kind of problems both personal and professional that manga artists can feel as they both start and maintain their careers in the field of manga. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall story of the show I felt was also a strong point of the series as not only did it allow us to see the members of the main cast develop both as individuals and as manga artists but also allow us to see them doing so as they work alongside each other, bond with each other, have fun together and overcome problems together while at the same time not forgetting that at the end of the day they while professionals in their own right are still high school girls that are just at the beginning of their lives. Paired with this story is the strong chemistry that is established between Kaos and not just with her fellow manga artists but also with the many support staff that helps them in their everyday lives whether as high school students or as manga professionals. This chemistry when paired with the story is what really makes the story stand out as this allows us to see Kaos and the girls gradually mature as the series goes on both as individuals and as manga artists as they incorporate what they had learned from bonding with their friends into their work and improve not only themselves but also the work that they so cherish. One of the main themes of the series is, of course, the act of overcoming doubts and improving yourself to break your limits a theme that I felt was really appropriate for the series and handled really well within the series through the evolution of Kaos and the girls not just as manga artists but as individuals as well. Overall Comic girls was a series that I really enjoyed with its premise, story and the chemistry between its cast being the highlight of the series. As a final score, I would say that Comic girls would easily deserve a final score of 10/10 and is easily one of the best animes i seen this season. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "A few years ago, I asked myself if we\u2019ll ever get another series about characters making manga. Series like Bakuman and Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun are among some of the most entertaining anime I\u2019ve seen that explored such ideas. In recent years, we had series about cute girls making games like New Game! or even characters working in the anime industry like Shirobako. Now it\u2019s 2018 and we got Comic Girls. \r\nI\u2019ll say right off the bat that the series is about as simple as it sounds. It\u2019s an anime that explores the daily life misadventures of a group of female mangaka. For a series thatdeals with such a simple premise, the way it executes its storytelling is just as effective. At its core, the show uses its character cast to do the storytelling. Every day is an adventure of its own as we see how these characters interact and behave. In essence, the series provides the opportunity to showcase manga making in a very casual, everyday life environment.\\n\\n\r\nOur main characters consists of a group of young girls of similar age. They have nicknames and all have them different preferences in their manga tastes. For instance, Koyume prefer shoujo manga compared to other genres. Ruki loves ecchi and fan service in her work. Tsubasa\u2019s passion for shounen manga is also reflected in personality. Then, there\u2019s Kaoruko Moeta (Kaos) who just wants to improve herself as a manga artist after having her work met with overwhelming negative reception. The main selling point is how these characters are motivated to do what they love through their connections with each other. \\n\\n\r\nAs a fan of the manga, the adaptation is relatively faithful and brings the mood of the series to life. The lighthearted tone of every episode is what you can expect from most \u201ccute girls doing cute things\u201d shows. Now I\u2019ll be honest with you. If this type of show isn\u2019t what you\u2019re familiar with or a fan of, then it may be hard to enjoy this. There\u2019s not much character development despite the series exploring a life journey of these young mangaka. Storytelling on most parts is very simple and doesn\u2019t get any complicated as time goes on. Every episode has a repetitive nature and it feels like if you\u2019ve seen one, you\u2019ve seen them all. There are some characters the series brings in that occasionally spark more popcorn entertainment such as horror mangaka Suzu Fuura, Tsubasa\u2019s shounen style cosplays, and various misunderstandings. However, don\u2019t expect this series to be one that\u2019s dramatic or even competitive. In fact, the show is hardly about competition when it comes to manga craft but instead about characters working to improve themselves. The comedy is presented through reactions, character interactions, characters\u2019 behaviors. There\u2019s not much characterization although we do see some of the family backgrounds of the cast. In retrospect, these characters are pretty easy to understand along with the show itself.\\n\\n\r\nNexus is a studio that\u2019s probably known for its 2015\u2019s anime adaptation, Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry. While this series is nowhere near on that level of fan service, it still contains fan service and skinship. It\u2019s mainly mild and nothing too distracting. In some places, it\u2019s necessary as one of the mangaka wants to improve her skill of making \u201cteenage love\u201d manga. On a technical level, the series looks crisp with colorful quality and cute character designs. The series never hides Kao\u2019s shyness or Tsubasa\u2019s tomboy tendencies. Suzu Fuura and her mischievous personality is also animated with such intention. The series\u2019 character designs may also be misleading at times as such characters look older than they seem. Luckily, it doesn\u2019t hold them back as every characters\u2019 voice fits well with their persona. The theme songs for the show overall also contains the style of what slice of life should be with mangaka theatrics. \\n\\n\r\nComic Girls, the series about mangaka striving to improve their craft did what it needed to do and I didn\u2019t expect anything more. It\u2019s a simple series that capitalized on the chance to explore mangaka lifestyle. It succeeds doing that through the storytelling and can even occasionally surprise you. But if you\u2019re not a fan of this type of series, then it may be hard to look back and enjoy what it is. Still, give the show a chance and see what awaits you on the other side.\\n",

            "content": "The cute girls genre recieves a fantastic addition with Comic Girls, an anime I definitely didn't expect to be as good as it ended up being.\r\nThis story is focused on a group of girls who love manga and either draw one professionally, or are trying to get a series published. This proves to be difficult for our lovable protagonist, Kaos, who honestly is just awful at it, and goes to live in a dormitory for female manga artists where she meets the other main characters of the series, hopefully getting inspiration from them.\r\nComic Girls uses the setting really well to provide a fantastic comedy bothvia the characters and the use of the manga elements. This anime doesn't focus on the profession like series as Bakuman or Shirobako do, but it's still quite informative and, most importantly, succeeds at using it for the comedic value it wants.\\n\\n\r\nThere are four main characters in this story: our protagonist, Kaoruko Moeta (pen-name Kaos), who is an absurdly likeable and quite relatable girl who seems to be in constant state of panic, but is also a hard worker that you will want to adopt and protect, Tsubasa, a tomboyish girl who draws shounen manga and puts herself really seriously in the mind of the characters she creates, Ruki, who loves drawing cute things but ended up discovering her true skills at drawing lewd stuff instead to her embarassment, and Koyume, a cheerful shoujo manga artist and doughnut devourer who can't draw guys. Their personalities balance well and make for a lot of entertaining situations, and together with fantastic (and also quite touching at times) episodes focused on each character I ended up very attached to them. The number of secondary characters is pretty short but they do well when they appear and add to the fun that comes from this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style and character designs of the series are very visually appealing, with lots of nice character reactions and well done use of the camera angles, studio Nexus hasn't done many things yet but I would be totally in for them doing more series in the future because they never fail to deliver in terms of quality. The music on the other side is nothing memorable but fits well for the tone of the scenes, the opening and ending themes are two good songs by the VAs of the four protagonists, with the later having some really nice transitions into it at the end of some episodes.\\n\\n\r\nComic Girls is a fantastic series I enjoyed a lot and I really recommend to watch to any fan of the cute girls genre, or for anyone looking for a comedy series to watch, because this one delivers hard.\\n",

            "content": "Comic Girls fits in an interesting spot for CGDCT shows. While there is an abundance of CGDCT that manage to have nice light fluffy interactions but with little depth, it s rare to see a show like Comic Girls where the depth of the show is the highlight. With Comic Girls there is a lot of depth given to the characters, who they are, what they're aiming for, and the growth that they have as comic artists. While the characters do have their gimmicks and can seem a bit cliche at the start. There is much more to them than that. One thing I appreciateis that they all seem to be modeled off the genre of manga that they are writing. Koyume acts like a shoujo protagonist. Tsubasa acts like a shounen protagonist. Moeta acts like a combination between the typical CGDCT protagonist and its audience. While it does lead them to be more prototypical than they could be it also creates and interesting and humorous meta joke.\\n\\n\r\nBy itself that is nice but nothing special, but what is great is how it's used for their development and how their depth gets explored due to that. With Koyume, the shoujo mangaka, an empathsis on love is brought into her character arc, including her learning how it feels to actually be in love and the feelings that she has. With Ruki, a josei ecchi mangaka, she learns how to love herself and what she does even those it may seem shameful or something not to be proud of. With Moeta, the CGDCT mangaka, she learns how to have friends and be accepted by them as well as how to deal with all of her self-esteem issues. They all have issues that bring them to be more than just the meta archetypes that they start with. It makes them compelling as characters and their successes that much more satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nAnother interesting point in Comic Girls' depth is its yuri. While a lot of CGDCT like to do hints at yuri and make soft yuri ships, Comic Girls goes beyond that. There are explicit statements of love towards other girls as well as focus on those feelings. They aren't treated as a joke but rather with power and focus. Not only that but they're not content to just show it and have the fandom supply the rest. Comic Girls actually shows reasons why the two characters would fit together well, why they like each other, and how each other improves each other's lives. With a lot of romances it often feels like the main point is a statement of the characters being in love with each other rather than a focus on what makes them so good together. Comic Girls' eschews that by showing how the two help each other, and why they like each other. It makes for a very satisfying romance, when many other CGDCT only teased at one.\\n\\n\r\nInterestingly while Comic Girls manages to handle its depth well it does have an issue with it's more SOL moments. While these are usually the bread and butter of CGDCT shows, and is the easier parts for a show to do Comic Girls' SOL moments are pretty generic and standard. While the chemistry that the cast has goes a long way, the gimmicks are relied on a lot, and in general the jokes are nothing special, especially when compared to the large library of CGDCT works. Too often overused jokes are made, or the same material is riffed on over and over again.\\n\\n\r\nThat said I feel like the characters, and the great depthful moments more than make up for that. The art is also quite nice and the general finished product is a good one although not a spectacular one. \\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day I'd say Comic Girls is a really good CGDCT and one that any fan of CGDCT should happily pick up. It may not have the strongest jokes or fluff, but the overall combination of material is great.",

            "content": "Comic Girls was a pleasant surprise. I was a bit worried at the beginning of episode one when the show cut between a manga author and editor. I assumed it would be similar to Bakuman, a show I wasn't very fond of. Luckily, the show takes a unique turn in showing the daily lives of well-known manga author roommates instead of aspiring manga authors still living with their parents. The show is well designed, with care put into the backgrounds as well as the character designs. Each girl has a unique and rounded personality, separating them from tropes associated with the slice of life genre.Situations these characters are put into for humor are far different from most comedy anime, making for great some jokes. These girls also love their jobs more than anything, and are as much fans of the manga medium as they authors and artists. You can see the characters bond over this common interest, despite each girl's writing style being completely different and being at different stages in their careers. My only real gripe with this show other than the start of the first episode is putting all of these girls in school. Fortunately, the characters don't stay there long and both the girl's preparation for school and the school's design are very creative. I'm just a bit frustrated that this show couldn't just be about the lives of adults working creative jobs. Other than those very minor problems, this show was surprisingly entertaining. I'd recommend this to any manga fan or anyone looking for a slice of life comedy to fill their time.",

            "content": "To be honest, I really enjoy Shoujo manga/anime. And yes this anime very enjoyable. The story is telling us about shoujo mangakas (girls making manga) daily live. For someone loves shoujo manga can already imagine core of this anime, girl's life.\r\nStory 7/10\r\nI know shoujo manga/anime sometime can be so bored cuz many of them only focus on 'moe-moe' and do any plot to make character more 'moe-moe'. In this anime, yes still moe is important dishes, but the story, shoujo mangaka is a good one. Not so tasteless, but there's some crisp on it.\r\nArt 8/10\r\nYes, this about moe. Shoujo anime must be moe! Definitely! Andthe background effect is pretty good I think. Animation just soso, no battle scene, nothing must be noticeable.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10)\\n\r\nMoe voice? Yes please! Some of seiyuu (voice actor) already popular. But one of the main characters is a fresh one. But still, very nice.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (8/10)\\n\r\nUnique personality for each character is very good! And it makes a daily life joke which very enjoyable and crisp.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10)\\n\r\nActually I want to give it 10/10. But I'm a big fan of shoujo manga/anime, so let's just minus one it. If you love moe character, scene full of woman, just dive in! If you want some lite story and enjoyable, just put your ass down and start watching.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10)\\n\r\nIt's a good anime to relax with. If you still consider it, just imagine a world of moe where you can watch all of moe interact with each other with a different moe personality. It's about MOE!",

            "content": "I feel this anime really appeals to me as an artist. As an artist in high school myself, I feel I have some girls to relate to. I've wanted to try making my own manga, and now this anime seems to be teaching me some techniques that I will use.\r\nStory 6/10:\r\n The story overall isn't fantastic, but that kind of is the point! Kaoroku Moeta (or Kaos-chan) is a high school student who is a struggling artist. She moves into a dormitory for other female mangaka to get inspiration and learn new techniques and get a serialized manga. The anime follows Kaos and her newfriends Konome (a shoujo artist who can't draw male characters), Tsubasa (a shonen mangaka who got her first series published and has a bit of a tendency to imitate her characters), and Rukki (a hentai artist who wants to draw kids manga) on their daily lives juggling school, serialized manga, fans, self-esteem issues, and improving drawing skills. It's meant to focus on the little things, as this is also a comedy anime. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThe art is important in a show on this topic, and Comic Girls delivers in that. Characters look distinct, have various facial expressions, and personality shown in their movements. Some side characters like animals even have this established (Nyaos is a prime example). All drawings shown that are created by the girls are well done (even the intentionally bad ones, as they are used for comedy making them good for their job), and some of the techniques used can easily be replicated. (DM me with some tips as I am trying to make my own manga too lol)\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nAll characters have fitting voices. The actors all do a really good job. Shoutouts to Takahashi Rie, the actor of Tsubasa, as this tone she uses is different to how I last heard her voice in a anime (Takagi San). The OPs and EDs also have good musical composition. Every time a character appears on screen in the OP or ED, their voice is heard singing (I'm imagining this with JOJO as Ono Daisuke tried to sing the OP and failed hilariously.) All these actresses are amazing at their job in singing and acting. It is so weird tho hearing Takahashi sing in character as she usually doesn't sing in the more monotone voice. Also the action music that plays with Tsubasa's impersonations is hilarious.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\r\nThese characters are so relatable to me.\\n\\n\r\nKaos: Young struggling mangaka who can't draw well. She is also shy and easily scared. Also she openly is a bit homosexual lmao. (Reminds me of a younger me)\\n\\n\r\nKonome: Kaos' best friend. She is energetic and this bounces off well with Kaos. A sort of Ryuji-Akira sort of vibe, in where they are so different but they like each other and support each other type of thing. Konome draws shoujo manga, but can't draw male characters. (Tbh i have a similar problem due to my art style). Her bubbly personality reminds me of myself.\\n\\n\r\nTsubasa: MY WAIFU. SHE IS MINE! (second to Sheska) Tsubasa is a shonen mangaka (hmmmm that's what I'm doing) who impersonates characters (kinda like I DO), and is a bit cold but loving (like when i had crippling depression). Tsubasa is more experienced than Kaos and Konome, and is willing to help them out and teach them new techniques, and even help out with finances (^o^). 10/10 waifu for me! Just need her to Jojo pose once and then she'd be number 1.\\n\\n\r\nRukki \"Big Boobies\u2665Himeko Chan\": The master of hentai herself. Rukki is really perverted (she draws hardcore porno), imagines her friends doing it, and ends up looking like she is having sex on multiple occasions. She claims to have big titties as a mangaka, but she is depressed that she is actually flat. She also writes teen romances, but mostly P O R N.  Rukki wants to draw a kids manga, but is too perverse to do so. (TBH she reminds me of my addiction with this pervy stuff) She is a nice girl and is understanding and a bit of a mentor to Kaos. KaoRukki I ship it! Her pen name is Big Boobies\u2665Himeko Chan.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall I am enjoying this series a lot! After the anime finishes, I will read the manga, and pray for season 2, and a dub so I can get a Blu Ray release in my local tech store. I'm going to also take the tips I've learned and build up the courage to release my own manga. I'm hoping I can be successful like these girls are (and trying to surpass themselves), and as an artist, this anime is a must watch. Also its fucking hilarious. \\n\\n\\n\r\n(This review will be updated once any announcements are made, and once I complete the current season. The score won't change much, but some minor details in the review may be tweaked)\\n\\n",

            "content": "Comic Girls is one of the most overlooked shows of the Spring 2018 season. At the time of this writing, it ranks in as the #16 new TV series of the season on MAL based on the number of members attached to it. I\u2019m sure that a large part of this is due to many \u201cserious\u201d anime fans dismissing moe, slice of life, cute girls doing cute things (CGDCT) shows on reflex. But I feel that this show deserves much more recognition than its getting, not just from slice of life fans, but from anime fans in general.\r\nComic Girls is part of the \u201ccute girls+ activity\u201d sub-genre of CGDCT shows which K-ON! largely brought into style. In this show, the activity that these cute girls are taking part in is creating manga. While the series doesn\u2019t go as deep into manga production as a series like Bakuman, drawing manga is definitely a more significant part of the story than the music in K-ON! and the activities of many other shows of this type. If you are interested in how manga is made but felt that Bakuman was a little too dry (and if you think it could be improved by cute girls), then this might be a great alternative for you.\\n\\n\r\nSo let\u2019s go ahead and get into my category breakouts:\\n\\n\r\n-----Story - 9 out of 10-----\\n\r\nThe story centers around four girls as they work on their respective (individual) manga careers in a dormitory specifically set up for young manga artists. The story mainly focuses on Kaos-sensei, a very small high school girl who gets sent to the dorm by her editor when she\u2019s having trouble producing anything good. She had a debut one-shot manga published which wasn\u2019t particularly well received. She joins two established manga artists who both have ongoing series in serialization as well as a fellow newcomer. Being that this is largely a true slice of life series in form, not much in the way of actual \u201cplot\u201d goes on. Most of the story revolves around Kaos sucking, the other girls working and dealing with their production schedules, or just regular old everyday life stuff. However, in the context of the kind of story that is being told, it\u2019s all rather well done. The comedy is well-paced with tight delivery and there is a steady stream of heartfelt moments. There are a few spots that are a little slower than they really needed to be (the final episode or two comes to mind), but the payoff was almost always worth it.\\n\\n\r\n-----Art - 9 out of 10-----\\n\r\nTrue slice of life shows tend to be some of the least demanding in the art department. There are usually no grand landscapes or crazy effects or action sequences. However, Comic Girls still does a rather exceptional job in this regard. To go along with the manga theme, the art direction of the series tends to have a heavily manga-inspired look with cool cuts and panel-windows inserted on the screen. It works very well and the overall look of the series is fun and clean. They also don\u2019t cut any corners when it comes to the presentation of the different girls\u2019 manga art as they all have their own distinct styles. The animation of their manga production is also very good, showing both traditional and digital production in natural and believable ways. The cuts to drawing manga never looks bad and never breaks immersion.\\n\\n\r\n-----Sound - 9 out of 10-----\\n\r\nThe sound direction for Comic Girls is rather solid. The opening and ending theme songs are good and the score is nice. But where these kinds of shows really need to shine is in the voice acting and Comic Girls does not disappoint. All of the characters are voiced with feeling and they all seem to fit the characters well. You really sense the excitement when the girls are talking about their passions as well as how down they feel when something isn\u2019t going quite right. It is all just very well done.\\n\\n\r\n-----Characters - 10 out of 10-----\\n\r\nThe success of slice of life and especially CGDCT shows absolutely hinges on their characters. Luckily, the characters in this series and their interactions with each other are all just wonderful! From the moment that we see Kaos, her weird small cuteness is evident, emphasized with her almost comical ability to attract animals. Koyume\u2019s peppy airheaded nature is a lot of fun to watch as is her love for another character.... Tsubasa\u2019s passion for her long-running shounen manga is exciting and funny to watch at the same time and it makes her sparse moments of distress all the more amusing. Then Ruki\u2019s concern over making a series in a genre that she is embarrassed by (smut) and not really fitting the image of someone you\u2019d expect to write such things (being an inexperienced high school girl with an unimpressive figure) causes her much more stress than it should while she is still able to maintain the status of being the most mature and well-put-together of the main four. The series also has a great supporting cast with very fun adults and a fifth girl who is one year older than the rest and not seen much because of \u201creasons\u201d. The characters are truly all great fun and if you connect with them, it will make the series for you.\\n\\n\r\n-----Enjoyment - 10 out of 10-----\\n\r\nI loved this series. Despite some minor pacing issues and maybe not going into enough detail with some of the story elements than it could have, everything just worked for me in the end. As I score based purely on enjoyment, this did end up getting a 10 from me on my personal list. Other than just getting immersed in the lives of these girls, I was also able to relate to a lot of the art elements as someone who did draw regularly in the past (especially in high school). While they don\u2019t go particularly deep into the production of manga, I feel that there is enough here for anyone who has ever attempted to draw in any serious or semi-serious fashion to relate to. Early on the girls talk about things that they are just not very good at drawing and there are also instances of procrastination and just not knowing what to draw. While there are a lot of funny moments in the series, it also feels genuine, coming from a place of love and not just being some cash-in or purely an advertisement for the source manga.\\n\\n\r\n-----Overall - 9 out of 10 (Conclusion)-----\\n\r\nWell, in case it isn\u2019t clear already, I think this series is great. While it does stumble at times, I feel that everything else in the series makes up for it. If you enjoy this kind of show, it is definitely worth seeing. Let yourself get taken in by the characters and laugh and cry and smile ear-to-ear like an idiot. Now, would this be enough to convert the \u201cserious\u201d anime fans to the joys of CGDCT? Eh, probably not; they\u2019ll most likely have their minds made up going in and not be able to see this as anything but the pointless moe dribble that is RUINING ANIME!! But for anyone else who can just let themselves watch something nice without any kind of earth-shattering plot, keep an open mind, and enjoy the lives of some cute girls, then you shouldn\u2019t be disappointed, especially if you\u2019ve ever enjoyed creating art of your own.",

            "content": "Remember the archetype forms that we have come to know and love or hate all these years? More recently, the \"Cute Girls Doing Cute Things\" genre has set off recent classics such as Madhouse's amazing \"A Place Further Than The Universe\" last season and much earlier, to Passione's \"Hinako Note\" in the same season last year. This season introduces us to Comic Girls, which tells us the tales of 4 mangaka girls, each with their own aspirations to make it big in the comic zone (and potentially get their hard work paid out in the process).\r\nThe series core is as simple as it can comeclose to, but don't dismiss it as bad, because it is wholesomely good and holds well on its own. And who doesn't mid a simple premise yet the storytelling does the rest of its job maintaining the direction of the series? I'll take that any day than some convoluted storylines which only make sense towards the ending of some series (*cough* Dances of the Dragons \"cough*). At the very core, this series teaches us the ups and downs of life being mangaka, because in real-life Japan, while replicating as faithful as the manga adaptation was, it is a direct but not perfect exact situation. HOWEVER, what Comic Girls was able to slap with was some moments of literally comical-drawn scenes and some yuri (but thankfully not too much) scenes but what I loved is how everything comes together to form a single imperfect but pretty representation overall.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters (Kaos, Tsubasa, Ruki, Koyume plus the illusive Fuura) all are really likeable on their own AND as a whole. Kaos being the childlike newcomer, learning the ropes from experienced mangaka, Tsubasa with her action sequences, earning her the name \"V-Wing Senpai\", Ruki with her calm, composed yet flushed expressions, Koyume whose mindfulness rests on her health (bulging stomach) but still focuses on yuri manga (light-hearted) and the ghost-like Fuura which scares the heck of the cast every now and then. Overall, they mesh well together and as one, they overcome the extremes of being mangaka and are able to have quality time together regardless of the circumstances and that's pretty satisfying to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation is comical-like (you see the relation?), bringing the title to relation. For one, studio Nexus is a newly founded studio in recent years, whose reputation lies in the OK-made Wakaba Girl back in 2015 and the excellent \"Calvary of a Failed Knight\" (also in 2015). So you could discount this as a new studio...BUT! For another, their work on this series IS impressive to boot, bringing their prowess from Calvary over to here, and I've gotta say, the art and animation is what hooked me into this series in the first place. It's just so beautiful and well-made, even the comical-drawn-esque scenes were well done with the classical character model faces made to replicate as mangaka would draw on comic grid paper. Another point that's seeing the effort of the people behind this series, absolutely marvelous.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is something else too. For one, I absolutely have a love-hate relationship on the OST being handled by the cast and/or crew of series gone by, probably because they sound mediocre but decent at the same time, and this series broke my convention and having the OST delivered nicely is something I appreciate so much about this series. Yes, it's THE cast of the Comic Girls, but I love the OST here so much so that's it's energetic and calming respectively (for OP and ED).\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the elephant in the room? I'm really quite sad that this series is underrated and underappreciated, just by the initial looks of it that people cast of as an generic anime and forgot about it. So take my word, try this series out and see how much it can surprise you by having less characters, a simple story and pretty good OST, and how everything combined forms a picture of a thousand words. Yet another CGDCT, BUT it's a well done CDGCT, a blast to watch and time well spent.",

            "content": "Usually, I don't watch shows with cute girls doing cute stuff but this one was an exception. Comic Girls is my absolute favourite of Slice of Life cute girls. \r\nStory 9/10:\r\nThe story revolves around Kaoruko Moeta - a mangaka who has just begun her manga creator life. Sadly, all of her storyboards are rejected and she can't get her chapter into a magazine. Then, she got to know about the dorm for female manga artists, who wants to work together. Moeta decides to go there, and then she meets her dorm friends - Tsu-chan, Rukki, Koyume and later, Fuura-san. All of the girls work togetherto get their mangas serialized and when they don't have the deadline, they're just doing silly stuff.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10:\\n\r\nAs i said at the beggining of this review, i don't watch those types of show, because the art style usually is slowly going into chibi but the art from this show was really great! I liked everything about it, the anatomy was on point and the characters weren't lifeless.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10:\\n\r\nThere weren't many soundtracks in this anime but the opening, ending and some soundtracks were really great.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10:\\n\r\nThey were absolutly briliant and amazing. Let me introduce you to them:\\n\\n\r\nKaoruko Moeta - the main protagonist. She's a typical moe, she apologies for everything and she works really hard to have her manga in the magazine. She's cheerful, happy but her motivation is really low and she's emotionaly unstable. Her type of manga is shojo, slice of life and chibi and 4-koma. Her pen name is Chaos.\\n\\n\r\nTsubasa ,,Tsu-chan'' Katsuki - She's usually quiet, don't express emotions that much, but when she goes to her cosplay time... She literally turns herself to a typical shounen-character.Her manga is on-going and the type of it is shounen. Her pen name is Wing-V.\\n\\n\r\nRuki ,,Rukki' Irokawa - the most mature girl in the dorm. She's calm, nice and loves to help others. Her pen name is Big Boobies\u2665Himeko even tho her breasts aren't big. At first, she wanted to draw cute, animal mangas for children but her manager said that her ability to draw characters with big breasts was really good and now she draws erotic manga.\\n\\n\r\nKoyume Koizuka - a typical deredere. Always happy, cheerful and loves sweets. She really adores Tsu-chan and she doesn't know if it's love or not. Her type of manga is shojo and romance. Her pen name is Koisuru Koyume.\\n\\n\r\nSuzu Fuura - she appear out of nowhere, really. Her manga type is horror so she's stylizing herself to be like a ghost. She loves screams of the other dorm girls and likes to scare them, but it just means that she really loves her friends and admires them, she's kind of a yandere. She really loves to help others. Even tho she loves scary stuff, she's scared of thunder.  It is said that she lives in the same area as Moeta lives. She's not very popular and her pen name wasn't revealed.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10:\\n\r\nI really loved watching this show. The jokes were good, the characters wasn't emotionless and they were just having fun. Also it was really great to watch the work of the mangakas and their usual problems (deadlines, not having motivation etc.). It never been boring to me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10:\\n\r\nI really reccomend this show for people who are interested on how the mangakas works, who are interested in cute girls doing cute stuff, highschool life (even tho most of the action takes place in the dorm). This was one of the best slice of life series that i've ever watched! \\n\\n",

            "content": "I started watching this from the very first episode. But due to me starting to read LN, I got more interested in reading than watching. Now that I've mostly caught up. I've come back and finished this gem.\r\nThis is honestly, My favorite show of the season. With only one other show I found interest in. It's not that surprising.\r\nThe characters in this I really like. I ended up associating their hair-color more to their names than their actual names. For example. \r\nI call characters \r\nPurple-Hair-Girl > Ruki\r\nBlonde-Hair-Girl ( Also could be Yellow-Hair-Girl )> Koyume \r\nBlue-Hair-Girl > Katsuki\r\nBlack-Hair-girl > Fuura\r\nPink-Hair-Girl < Kaos \r\nThe names besides Kaos'sname weren't really that rememberable. So I ended up usually calling them by their most unique characteristic\\n\\n\r\nI like Kaos. She is probably the MC of the MC's. Although she usually isn't as focused on. I like her really pervy side while also being really innocent. She will always be filled with joy when being hugged by the other girls. I do end up feeling kind of bad for her that she is so small. I like imagining that off-screen she has a massive growth spurt and at least becomes as tall as the other girls. I'd love if they went away for summer and when they come back, Kaos Is a giant girl with big boobs and what not, Just so I could see their reaction, I'd imagine that Ruki would get a ton of... Material for her manga work.\\n\\n\r\nRuki Is probably my favorite if not then 2nd favorite right next to Kaos. I like her character and personality. I also love how she only really exceeds in drawing Porn even though she's more of what you'd call the level-headed one. There are plenty of Yuri themes in this. But I do think both Ruki and Kaos are the best together.\\n\\n\r\nKoyume Isn't a bad character. But I have seen her character before in other anime. So I don't have too much to say. She's the airhead of the group and has a crush on Katsuki.  She also loves food, That's mostly her character. She's still fun to have on screen. But boiled down and she seems kind of basic.\\n\\n\r\nFuura Is probably my 3rd favorite even with her having the least amount of screen time. Her character fits her genre of music (Horror) I'd say that both her and Ruki are probably the most attractive of the group. I do think both Ruki and Fuura would also be a good couple tbh. I have trouble deciding if I like Ruki and Kaos more or if I like Furra and Ruki more. So I decided to just settle it and say fuck it, We're going the Harem route.\\n\\n\r\nKatsuki Is probably my least favorite of the group. I do find things I like about her. But she didn't interest me from the start. So with the story focusing so much on her tell around episode 7. My dislike seems to have grown more. When I look back, She's bad. She has funny moments. It's just during the time with having stuff shoved down my throat. I eventually got annoyed. I always like Tomboy characters. But she just doesn't do it well. I think her character would be more interesting If she was a very girlish girl but she tries to act like a Tomboy for her stories or whatever. When she was acting girly, I think she was actually pretty interesting.\\n\\n\r\nI noticed from around episode 10 or 11 tell the end, That the creators got really creative with the animation. It was honestly a nice sudden change from the usual calm animation you'd expect from a show of this genre. \\n\\n\r\nI do find episode 11 and 12 to be kind of depressing with them moving out and them seeing all the other Manga artist that have already grown up. I felt that was a little down but then we got to the very end of episode 12.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, This show is pretty good and much more then what I'd expect with such a premise.\\n",

The story is simple and easy to follow. The characters are loveable and well designed, even has one of my favourite supporting characters of all time. The art is beautiful and pretty cute at times. Sound is also prettygood, for reasons I can not really say without spoiling a bit.\\n\\n\r\nThis Anime made me cry, it made me laugh and fall in love. And that is really all that matters.

I found myself enveloped in the anime and it's world filled with colourful characters and scenery as it enabled me to sit down and relax, absorbing the cheerful, light-hearted atmosphere of it's medium. \r\nThe storyline wasn't boring in any sense, although, a bit cliche at times perhaps, but interesting to the level that i'd stayed hooked to the anime's various characters, all with their different niches and internal struggles. After a while, I had found myself subconsciously becoming attached to thefour main characters of the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe art style seemed quite appropriate for the setting and the demeanour of the show, light; yet not overly simplistic. The soundtrack followed a similar path, enjoyable, but nothing overly substantial for the quality of Comic Girls.

My personal opinions I think this anime overrated.\r\nStory is simple, about four girl in manga's dormitory. If you expect this anime will be like bakuman or about manga's industry, I said nope. This anime will be like generic cute girl do cute things with content there can find in other that in same genres. For short this anime is only about 4 girls manga writer's life in dormitory. \r\nArt and Music is good. I'm enjoy with them.\r\nEvery characters in this anime will be different stereotype live together, If thiscan make charm from these stereotype will be okay, but result is every character is very annoying. Like they hired to make every action to match their stereotype. So much is Moeta and Katsuki. Moeta is one character is same since episode 1 to episode 12, I know she has develop in the end and that is very slowwwwwwww I think I will be annoy her for first, She should be like in the end episode since episode 5 or 6. But thing this anime make well is distributing characters' story. If I'm not interested in personality I think they have interesting background's story. Unfortunately If this anime more emphasize with this, I think I will like this anime.\\n\r\nThing I feel annoying from this anime is drama that swtich with comedy in every episode in level make tone in watching broken. For Example.\\n\r\n(Every Character do something and make we laugh)\\n\r\nOne Character: Oh I have bad past bla bla ba\\n\r\n(Sad Music come)\\n\r\nOverall, This anime are not too bad, If you like cute girl do cute things or kira kira girls you may be like this anime. But It's bad and boring for me.\\n\r\nScore:3 two from art/music and one from background stroy of every character.",

            "content": "Adapted from a manga series,Comic Girls surely tries to bring the pain and struggle of the manga Industry into an anime,together with its own style.Although keeping its own style is important,they should also consider whether it'd be a great idea from a general anime perspective.By now,it somehow shows its uniqueness,but doesn't feature Comic Girls really well.\r\n+good opening and ending song\r\n+diversified characters' personalities \r\n+Hilarious and crazy characters' actions\r\n+nice character reactions\r\n+Ending summed up the story\r\n-it feels episodic \r\n-Bad story premise\r\n-story feels shattered because characters work on their own\r\n-repetitive or overused ideas \r\n-undeveloped characters\r\n-poor transitions\r\nAt my first glance,I was really excited about Comic Girls,I saw cute girls,beautiful visualswith characters with different personalities,I also received servals laughters too.With such a great start,Comic Girls could be potential.However,it starts to get lame and boring later on,which I couldn't grow on the characters or the story anymore.\\n\\n\r\nThe main problem of Comic Girls is its presentation.At first,I was supposed that the characters in Comic Girls are working together,but in fact,they're just working on their own.Although sometimes they managed to help each other,at the end the main focus would be just onto one or two characters.Therefore,there're not much remarkable character interactions.Moreover,The story feels extremely inconsistent.It feels episodic,each episode doesn't have any sort of relationship towards others,many weird transitions all over the place.Sometimes,it has comedy moments,but then it suddenly jumps to emotional moments.In other time,it seems to be concentrated on one character,but then it talks about another character,which seems the story is going to nowhere and I don't know what exactly Comic Girls wants to express through each episode.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition,the character development doesn't seem to be good.Although each girl has their own personality,they feel pretty unrealistic and undeveloped.The setting that a bunch of highschool girls that are manga authors as well is a poor story premise for a slice of life anime,as this would be very unlikely happened in reality from a general perspective.In addition,there are also several unrealistic moments in Comic Girls as well.For example,teacher suddenly drags a student out of the classroom and said to him,I like your drawing.It feels very weird and abnormal.Apart from the characters just working on their own,the main storyline is just Kaos improving on her work.Other time,other main characters are just supporting cast,while only a few moments focusing on them.At the end,I just grew on a little on Kaos,but not for the others.\\n\\n\r\nI find that the comedy delivered to me is kinda funny and boring at the same time.At first,I get a lot of laughters because of the hilarious and crazy characters' reactions.Unfortunately,by the more episodes you have watched,it will become lame and flat,as ideas are becoming repetitive and overused.Characters feel jealous about other characters' boob size,scared of things and being sleepy during classes,it feels cliche,repetitive and boring,so overall the comedy offered in this show is unsatisfactory.If the comedy and ideas used in the show are refreshing and new,it'll be more interesting.Sadly,it doesn't happen in Comic Girls.\\n\\n\r\nAfter a long and rough ride,I finally come to the ending.The good news is that Comic Girls somehow manages to summarise the story events and the story ending is quite fine for a slice of life anime.\\n\\n\r\nFinally,let's talk about the animation and the sound in this show.I'm kind of impressed with the animation in this show. Colourful visuals are used and cute moments in a comic style,looks original and nice,together with different cute character reactions.It is kinda nice,but if more visuals are used on the background would be better.Voice actors are trying to play their roles well,opening and ending are nice and interesting with its own style.I noticed some background music and soundtracks in this show,but if there're more of them used in the show,it'll be greater.\\n\\n\r\nUnless you're in a similar position as the character,you probably won't able to get much enjoyment from this show.Although Comic Girls tries to attempt a great story with hilarious moments,it feels like a total mess and a failed work at the end,except for the ending.Therefore,many improvements and efforts are needed in order to develop a better and an amusing slice of life,comedy anime.\\n\\n\r\nI used to love slice of life and comedy anime,but not this one apparently.\\n\\n\r\nStory:5/10 (D) (35%)\\n\r\nAnimation:8/10 (A) (10%)\\n\r\nSound:7/10 (B) (10%)\\n\r\nCharacters:4/10 (E) (25%)\\n\r\nEnjoyment:5/10 (D) (20%)\\n\r\nOverall:5/10 (D) (Fair)",

            "content": "Now this was a surprising anime. I went in expecting your typical \u201ccute girls doing cute things\u201d moe slice of life comedy that we seem to get at least every season. And it was in fact a \u201ccute girls doing cute things\u201d moe slice of life comedy. I\u2019m already extremely partial to these type of shows and it\u2019s really hard to make them not enjoyable (With the exception Hinako Note. I\u2019m falling asleep just thinking about that one.) Comic Girls follows 4 manga artists who all move into a dormitory to work on their original stories and attend school. Surprisingly, the whole school aspect ofComic Girls isn\u2019t really embraced that much. There are a few scenes to be had in this environment, but most of the fun happens in the dorms or out in the city. From the get go, Comic Girls lets you know that you will love each and every character in this anime. All four of them manage to be so lovable and fun to see interact with one another. Kaos (The definite main character) should be protected and kept happy at all costs because she deserves to be loved and cherished. She\u2019s a 4-koma manga artist who struggles being... Well, good at manga. Tsubasa is an athletic tomboy who really only cares about her popular Shounen manga series. When she gets into writing, she dons the outfit of the hero of her manga to hype herself up. Ruki is s rather innocent and serious manga artist who despite wanting to stick with children stories, somehow ended up writing more erotic ones, much to her disappointment. Koyume is another up and coming manga artist who\u2019s always energized, peppy, and writes romance manga (She also has a crush on Tsubasa, so that\u2019s a plus.)\\n\r\nAll the characters have different methods when it comes to writing their stories, how they prepare, how they relax, and how they help one another. All four look out for one another and become genuine friends quickly. \\n\r\nThe comedy always hits its mark. There\u2019s never a joke that goes by that isn\u2019t at least worth an inner laugh. Yet the anime also manages to add in very touching moments. It finds the perfect balance of when to be funny and when to get emotional. While the animation isn\u2019t anything too special, Comic Girls does this thing where it\u2019ll suddenly appear like a manga panel on screen which can add to the charm and humor in some cases.\\n\r\nWhile it doesn\u2019t have the biggest focus on what goes into making a manga itself, it still shows how time consuming and stressful it can be, especially since the c at are all high schoolers. By the end of the anime, they all have grown in their own way in order to make their manga better than ever. You get to see how they improve and the strides they make as manga artists. It was filled with lovable characters, had great humor, great chemistry among the cast, and surprisingly touching moments. This is an anime I will genuinely miss seeing each week. I haven\u2019t heard much about the source material, but if there\u2019s enough to work with, I would be so damn happy to see Comic Girls make a return someday. We need more Adventures of Kaos-chan.",

            "content": "I might spoil the show when analyzing the characters. So don't read if you haven't watched the show! Unless you don't care...\r\nI am an artist. It may seem like I'm bragging, sorry if it does, but it is pretty important to my enjoyment for this show. Cause even though every artist doesn't have the same experiences, there are things that many artists do feel. \r\nBeing ashamed of oneself work, not feeling deserving of food and other self-destructive thoughts. \r\nI have never really seen an anime about art that shows this side of how artists feel. There are probably other shows that do this. Maybe evenshows I have seen that do this. But this is the show that has made me remember that part the most. Cause the artist part in many anime characters is irrelevant in most cases. The character might be memorable, but the fact that they're an artist isn't. It isn't important for the character that they are an artist.\\n\r\nI'm not saying that a character should change because of a hobby they have. But that's kind of what it is. To most artist characters I have seen, it is just a hobby. Again, this is fine. But for me to really resonate with an artist character, the art part should be their personality. They're hobby effects them as a person. That might sound weird. But it is the one thing that makes me like Comic girls so much.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIn the show, Moeta moves into a dorm with exclusively artist. This was a way for her to gain experience from these artists. To find inspiration. But as I see it, I wouldn't say that living there was particularly good for her. Yes, she finds very good friends and the ending might have been different if she didn't live there. But, Moeta doesn't really feel good living there, even though the friend she makes, makes her happy. Cause as I said before, there are things that artist do when they're not happy with their work. And living with two artists that already have serialized works, this feeling is only amplified. As Moeta lives in the dorm, she does a lot of self-destructive things. She stays up all night to finish her comic ideas, that she knows will inevitably be trashed. She rejects food since she doesn't feel deserving of it. Of course, she doesn't even have a serialized comic yet. \\n\\n\r\nAnd as an artist, I resonated with her a lot. All of the feelings she gets around her art is something me and a lot of artists feel. I can tell that an artist wrote the story. \\n\\n\r\nAnd she wasn't the only artist that was written so well. We also have Ruki and Tsubasa. While they weren't as relatable, they were still really good. While Tsubasa doesn't have any particularly bad feelings against her art (At least from what we know), her parents do. They are very much against her drawing. That's why she moves to the dorm so that her parents wouldn't shame her. \\n\r\nRuki also experiences something a lot of artists do. When becoming an artist, her agent sees how attractive her art style. She advises her to draw more attractive manga since her art style compliments this genre. This leads to her being successful as a hentai artist. And while she tries to implement a romance aspect into the comics, that doesn't help her self-image. The fact that she's a hentai artist kills her. It's only when she meets her fans and she sees how much they care for her story that her self-respect gets better. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSadly, this was only how I felt in the beginning When we stopped learning about their insecurities, the story gets a lot more boring. We keep seeing Moeta's self-destructive nature from time to time. But it wasn't as interesting as before. \\n\\n\\n\r\nBut because of my bias, I will give this show an 8. I would have given it a 7 before. But the very accurate depiction of artists was just so interesting to see. \\n\\n\r\nWeak 8/10",

            "content": "**** SHORT REVIEW (Kind of)****\r\nAs an casual anime watcher who usually despises Moe based anime , I didn't really expect anything good from this series when i started watching but this series proved me wrong and completely surprised me !! \r\nComic girls is a light-hearted comedy/ slice of life anime where the story revolves around the daily lives of female mangakas and tries to explains the effort behind creating a successful manga/comic series. \r\nFeel free to scroll down to the \"overall \" and \"pros and cons\" section.\r\nNow, lets cut right to chase shall we?\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nA simple yet interesting story which revolves around a girl namedKaoruko Moeta who moves into a dormitory to improve her manga where she meets other female mangaka of the same age. The story takes you on a road trip around the daily lives of the mangakas with perfectly timed comedy and beautifully portrayed and well timed emotional scenes. Overall, I really loved the story but I felt as a slice of life anime it should have been more realistic (the amount of kindness shown towards main character is absurd and unrealistic!! but of-course this is just my opinions :P). But other than that its a well deserved 9/10 for the story.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nThis is by far the most captivating part of the anime,the art style is moe with bright and delicately colored backgrounds which perfectly blends with the anime itself. The animation is smooth,colorful and realistic which makes you feel like you right beside the characters experiencing the moment. After a very long time I got the thought :- \"the art can't get any better than this.\". Easily a 10/10 for me.\\n\r\n(Studio Nexus nailed it here)\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThe opening and ending themes perfectly match the feels from the anime. And the ost and voices of the characters were splendidly done and well placed. 9/10 here.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nI never thought I would say this but the character were well developed and well portrayed for a 12-episode anime ,even the support characters were used exceptionally well. Each character had their own individual traits and very interesting backgrounds.\\n\r\nA very well deserved 9/10 here.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nAt no point of the episodes was i bored or even looked away from the screen. I was completely immersed into the show so again 10/10 here.(The fresh art style,story and character completely immersed me into the show)\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 9/10\\n\r\nIf you have ever felt you needed to take a break/escape from common psychological,horror,...etc genre of anime, I recommend you watch this series because it will leave you with a refreshed and calm mindset with a warm and cozy feeling in your heart. But I felt that it follows the usual high school girl path which disappointed a little since I wanted an adult perspective of being a mangaka but other than that the anime nailed it and hence the score.\\n\\n\r\n*(By the way if you are interested in knowing how a manga is made and what type of dedication it requires i highly recommend you watch this anime)*\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is definitely on my \"recommended\" list.\\n\\n\\n\r\nPROS:\\n\r\n1) Interesting story\\n\r\n2) Well-timed comedy moments\\n\r\n3) Characters were well voiced and portrayed\\n\r\n4) Art/Animation is beautiful\\n\r\n5) Ending was satisfactory\\n\r\n6) Moe\\n\\n\r\nCONS:\\n\r\n1) Moe (Yes, both negative and positive of the show)\\n\r\n2) Same old High Schooler's perspective (though we do get adult-perspectives of being a mangaka at the end)\\n\\n\r\nP.S  (\"May contain a lot of grammatical errors and still a beginner at reviews\")\\n\r\n*****************************************************************************\\n",

            "content": "Please note that this review is intended to be read by those that have finished watching Comic Girls and while care has been taken to minimize story related spoilers there may still be spoilers within character analysis. You have been warned. \r\nCute Girls learning to overcome their problems and flourish as true manga artists by bonding, having fun and living the life of a high school girl as they confront their struggles together as friends and fellow professionals. \r\nBased off a popular 4 panel manga of the same name Comic Girls is a comedy and slice of life anime that gives us the rare opportunityto see what the life of an aspiring manga artist is like and the kind of struggles that they have to face as they try to balance their personal lives with their professional careers. The first episode of the series made a pretty good impression on me and did a great job of hooking me as I was curious to see whether Kao\u2019s would be able to fit in a dorm and live alongside fellow manga artists her age and learn from them to save her career as a manga artist over a period of just one year. I'm glad that I decided to watch the series right to the end as it was a series that I really enjoyed watching.\\n\\n\r\nTaking place in modern day Japan the overall story of Comic Girls follows the life of Kaoruko Moeta a shy and timid high school girl and aspiring manga artist that thanks to a series of disastrous manga sales is forced to attend a well-known manga dorm for female manga artists in an effort to improve her manga drawing skills. At the dorm, she meets a number of fellow manga artists who while working in different genres of manga all share a passion for manga that Kao\u2019s can relate too. These include the kind and older sister like Ruki, the energetic and positive Koyume, the tomboyish but confident Tsubasa and the quiet and eccentric but surprisingly understanding Fura. As Kaoruko lives and interacts with this colourful cast at the dorm and at school Kaoruko would soon learn that being a manga artist is not just about trying to imagine an idea that you have never encountered or experienced before but rather its about drawing in ideas that you yourself have enjoyed doing with the friends that you have befriended and bonded with. One cannot draw a manga until they have experienced the scenes that they want to draw with their friends. \\n\\n\r\nKaoruko \\n\\n\r\nKaoruko played by new seiyuu Hikaru Akao in her first main role as a seiyuu is one of the main characters of the series and is the series main protagonist. A high school girl and an aspiring manga artist at the beginning of the series Kaoruko better known as her pen name Kaos was a nervous and mentally fragile girl that had very low self-esteem and was very weak to any form of pressure. While passionate towards manga and a relatively hard worker Kaos was hampered greatly by the fact that she has yet to experience the scenes that she draws in her manga panels which ended up causing quite the negative feedback from her readers as to them her scenes were unrealistic. As a result of this Kaos was given the opportunity to move to a female dorm designed specifically to allow female manga artists to focus and improve their skills. As a result of her low self-esteem and nervousness, Kaos at the beginning of the series had some trouble fitting in at the dorm and had great trouble in befriending her fellow manga artists who were the same age as she was due to the fact that until now few people had been nice to her. In line with this fear is Kao\u2019s belief that she is merely a background character when compared to the results that have been secured by others the same age as her. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series goes on, however, Kao's personality gradually changes as a result of her new-found friendships and bonds with her fellow manga artists and dorm mates. As a result of being able to not just form friendships but also experience the very actions that she will need to draw within her manga panels Kaos was able to realise that no manga artist is ever alone and that the best way to improve your skills as a manga artist is to first improve yourself and secondly experience the very events that you are drawing into your manga by living a life as an actual high school girl. While still nervous and timid to a degree Kaos becomes determined to change herself and live the life that she had been missing and draw what she experiences into her manga. While Kaos in the beginning of the series was hesitant about helping her seniors within the dorm as a result of her determination to improve herself this fear of the unknown gradually vanishes and she becomes more earnest and willing to help others as well as developing an interest into finding out why someone is acting the way that they are with this latter one being more prevalent in her interactions with the dorms resident horror manga artist Fura. The character of Kaos I felt was an interesting character that was both well designed and developed. Seeing Kaos transform from a quiet and meek girl that knew nothing about what an actual high school girl\u2019s life is like to one that was determined to live the life of one and use the memories that she makes with her friends to improve her skills as a manga artist I thought was one of the best things about her character. I felt that her seiyuu Hikaru Akao really did an excellent job of portraying the character of Kaos. \\n\\n\r\nRuki \\n\\n\r\nRuki voiced by veteran seiyuu Saori Oonishi of Food wars and Clockwork planet fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Kao\u2019s fellow dorm mates. A high school freshman and classmate of Kaos Ruki, unlike Kaos, is an established manga artist with her genre being teens love. A confident, imaginative and positive young woman Ruki is someone that easily fits the image of an older sister being not just kind and considerate towards her juniors but also perceptive enough to notice when something is bothering them. As an experienced manga artist Ruki knows very well the types of challenges that aspiring manga artists face as they try to break into the industry and make their mark on it and as a result while hardworking and earnest tries hard to create the perfect balance between her personal life and her pro career all the while watching over and encouraging her kohai\u2019s. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series goes on and as Ruki\u2019s character gets expanded upon it can be seen that Ruki also has a fair share of struggles that she has to deal with. While an experienced manga artist that has already established her place within the manga industry it can be seen that Ruki has mixed feelings about this. While happy that she has managed to establish a career in a field that she is interested in it can be seen that Ruki is somewhat embarrassed about the way people see her due to the fact that she\u2019s an ero manga artist which isn\u2019t helped by the fact that for whatever reason people often see her actions as being of the lewd nature even if she did not mean it to be so. A fact that I felt was hilarious as it contrasted with Ruki\u2019s usually composed attitude. In line with this is Ruki\u2019s complex in that she is conscious of the fact that her fans would imagine her as someone that is sexy and mature when she herself is not. As a result of this fear Ruki is shown to be wary of meeting new people and would go to great lengths to stop people from seeing her work on her manga due to both her embarrassment at having others see her work and at seeing the doubts that she has regarding whether this genre is really the one that she wants to be known for. As a result of these fears Ruki was shown to have a very deep fear of book signings as she was conscious of the reactions of her fans to her actual physical appearance an aspect of her that I really liked as it showed that no matter how skilled one was at writing and drawing the person behind that can be someone that\u2019s far from what one can imagine their favourite author to be. As a character, I felt that Ruki was one that was well designed and developed with her many fears and embarrassments contrasting well with her usual calm and mature self. The older sister like personality that she exhibited I felt helped greatly in allowing her juniors to overcome the fear and struggles that they faced in making their first marks on their careers. I felt that her seiyuu Saori Oonishi really did an excellent job at portraying the character of Ruki. \\n\\n\r\nTsubasa \\n\\n\r\nTsubasa voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Rie Takahashi of Re Zero and Konosuba fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Kao\u2019s fellow dorm mates. A high school freshman and a classmate of Kaos Tsubasa is unlike Kaos and Koyume an established manga artist with her speciality being a Shonen manga artist. A hardworking, positive and kind person by nature Tsubasa is someone that while quiet is someone that is friendly and kind to everyone that she meets whether they are juniors or adults. A confident and steadfast person by nature Tsubasa on initial appearance can easily be mistaken for a boy due to the fact that she insists on adapting the guise of a tomboy to hide her true identity from her friends and schoolmates. As a result of this Tsubasa is seen by many of her fellow schoolmates as someone that is cool, focused and calm something that she really appreciates as she feels that her normal self does not fit the image of her chosen speciality. While being less skilled with words than her fellow manga artist Ruki Tsubasa is shown to be someone that doesn\u2019t mince words and is someone that can be quite direct with her praise and is always willing to offer her honest opinion on something when asked for advice by others. Despite being only a high school girl Tsubasa is shown to be someone that\u2019s mature for her age and can easily take control of situations easily someone that I really like about her character. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series goes on Tsubasa\u2019s personality and character starts to gradually change as she interacts with her friends and fellow manga artists. While a quiet person by nature as the series goes on it can be seen that Tsubasa is someone that can get really focused into her work to the point where she can actually transform into the main character of her manga via the use of cosplay a fact that I found to be really hilarious. While having a well known and popular series can often make people arrogant this is not true for Tsubasa who seems to be fine with just being able to draw manga to her heart's content showing how humble she is regarding her profession. This aspect of her goes well with Tsubasa\u2019s core belief that only by drawing the best you can, can you get closer to the idea that you want. A prominent trait of Tsubasa\u2019s character is her insistence on adopting a tomboy persona that stems from the belief that her true appearance and the one that she adapts when going back home is unsuitable and not fitting the image of her speciality. While very determined to maintain her cool and mature tomboyish side to her fans and friends this feeling gradually changes as a result of Koyume\u2019s actions that cause her to regain some of her girly spirit.  The character of Tsubasa I felt was an interesting one that was both well designed and developed with the constant transformation into her manga\u2019s main character via the use of cosplay and the hilarity that this ensures being one of the best aspects of her character. Additionally, the struggle that Tsubasa has with her family and the decision to adopt an entirely new persona to allow her to better fit in her manga speciality I felt was well done and showed how determined Tsubasa was to make a name for herself in the manga world with or without her family\u2019s support. I felt that her seiyuu Rie Takahashi really did an excellent job at portraying the character of Tsubasa.\\n\\n\r\nKoyume \\n\\n\r\nKoyume voiced by veteran seiyuu Kaede Hondo of Battle Girls High school and Girlish Number fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Kao\u2019s fellow dorm mates. A high school freshman and schoolmate of Kaos Koyume like Kaos is an aspiring manga artist that while new already has a lot of experience in the industry due to her willingness to learn. A carefree, confident and positive girl by nature Koyume is someone that can freely fit into any environment that she enters whether it\u2019s a new school or a new dorm due to her positive, friendly and caring nature. An intelligent and fast thinking person by nature Koyume though still a new artist approaches her work as a shojo manga artist with both determination and passion aspiring to be a successful manga artist within the field like her fellow dorm mates. While having a vivid imagination Koyume at the beginning of the series had great trouble drawing material for her manga due to a lack of knowledge on romance matters. As a result of this at the beginning of the series, she like Kaos were in a state where they were forced to find new inspiration to improve their skills. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series goes on and Koyume\u2019s character and personality gets expanded upon it can be seen that while confident and positive Koyume is someone that can easily get embarrassed and lose her normal composure which is best shown when discussing matters related to romance and her relationship and admiration of her fellow manga artist and friend Tsubasa. This latter interest in Tsubasa as a romantic partner is also used as a running gag within the series as Koyume has a habit of picturing her as the male in her manga stories to her embarrassment and the amusement of her friends. While possessing boundless optimism and faith in her skills as a manga artist Koyume can become discouraged if people don\u2019t like her work but this latter part is offset by the fact that her happy and go lucky attitude always enables her to return back from the brink more energised and determined than before. The character of Koyume I felt was an interesting character that was both well designed and developed with her ability to stay positive and energetic at all times to offset Kao's sudden mood swings being the best aspects of her character. Additionally, her ability to come up with random ideas and expand them into crazy scenarios I thought was something that matched well with her personality. Her romantic interest into Tsubasa was also an aspect that I liked as it allowed us to see Koyume in a rare sight of panicking in embarrassment of having a secret found out. I felt that her seiyuu Kaede Hondo did an excellent job at portraying the character of Koyume. \\n\\n\r\nSuzu Fura\\n\\n\r\nSuzu Fura voiced by veteran seiyuu Reina Ueda of Relife fame is one of the main support characters of the series. A fellow manga artist and dorm mate of the girls Suzu Fura who is often called Fura sensei by the girls due to her experience is a quiet, isolated and awkward person by nature that seemingly prefers to stay within her room instead of socialising with her fellow dorm mates. A horror manga artist by trade Fura due to her awkwardness and lack of social skills is someone that has few friends in her life due to her scary nature that causes people to avoid her. As a result of this Fura often spends long periods of time in isolation creating material for her manga. As a result of this isolation, her first meeting with Kaos was about as much as a shock for her as it was for Kaos. In line with her isolation and her speciality as a horror manga artist Fura adapts a very distinctive physical appearance of white clothing that contrasts well with her dark hair that covers her eyes. An outfit that I thought suits both her chosen field and her personality of loving to hear others scream in terror really well. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series goes on and Fura\u2019s personality and character gets expanded upon it can be seen that Fura while a scary and somewhat unsettling person to be near is actually someone that is incredibly lonely due to her lack of friends. As a result of this loneliness Fura often compensates by acting overly friendly with people that she knows trying hard to savour the warmth that comes from being near people that she\u2019s familiar with which is best shown in the strong bonds that she manages to establish with Kaos despite the latter\u2019s initial fear of her. As a result of her awkwardness around people, it can be seen that Fura has a great deal of difficulty interacting with people that she\u2019s not familiar with and as a result can easily misunderstand their actions. Because of this personality, Fura is someone that is unused to people being kind to her and as a result, she holds people that do so in very high regard counting them as one of her dear friends. When relaxed and in an environment that suits her though it can be seen that Fura reverts back to her normal personality that she keeps hidden behind her scary one a personality that contrasts a great deal with her usual one. Instead of being scary and awkward around people in this personality Fura is instead a kind, attentive and patient person that can be surprisingly talkative and is a very capable teacher that uses both jokes and scares to allow her students to concentrate more on their work a far cry from her default persona. As a character, I felt that the character of Fura was an interesting one that was both well designed and developed with the contrast between her two personalities and her gradual opening of her heart to others as she bonds with and befriends her fellow manga artists and dorm mates being the best aspects of her character. I felt that her seiyuu Reina Ueda really did a fantastic job of portraying the character of Fura.  \\n\\n\r\nAMV \\n\\n\r\nAnimation wise I thought that the dorm that the main cast live and work at and the school that they attend as students were very well designed and did a great job of showing that a manga artist is able to work from anywhere as long as they have the creative resources that they need to create their work. The character designs for the characters whether for the main cast or the supporting cast I felt was well designed and matched well with the personalities of each character. The inclusion of manga setting scenes to illustrate individual scenes within the anime I thought was also well designed and matched well with the theme of manga creation. In terms of music, I really liked the series OST as it matched well with the many different emotions and feelings that the cast experience in each scene. The opening and ending themes for the series which was Memories and Namida wa Misenai which was sung by the series main cast I felt was pretty good with both conveying a cheerful and positive mood to the listener and matching well with the series main theme. In terms of voice acting, I felt that each member of the voice cast was able to do an excellent job of portraying their assigned characters. In particular, I feel that Hikaru Akao, Saori Oonishi, Rie Takahashi, Kaede Hondo and Reina Ueda who portrayed the characters of Kaos, Ruki, Tsubasa, Koyume and Fura all deserve special praise as I felt that they all did a fantastic job at portraying their assigned characters. In addition, though I didn\u2019t cover the members of the supporting cast I also felt that Aya Endo, Minami Tsuda and Ayaka Nanase who portrayed the characters of Ririka the dorms matron, Mayu Kao's editor and Miharu who was the homeroom teacher of Kao's class all deserve special mention as I felt that they did an excellent job of supporting the main cast in this series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall conclusion \\n\r\nOverall Comic girls was a series that I really enjoyed watching and had among its strong points an interesting premise, an excellent story, interesting and well-developed characters, strong voice acting and its inclusion of real-world issues into the professional lives of the girls. \\n\\n\r\nThe premise of the show I felt was an interesting one as unlike seiyuu\u2019s and the making of anime the creation of manga and what the life of a manga artist actually is like is something that is largely unknown to us. Unlike anime and seiyuu\u2019s the age of a manga artist is hard to ascertain because as human beings our skills and our innate talents at a particular action manifest at different times and as a result it\u2019s perhaps not unusual to have talented manga artists to actually be high school freshman instead of say young adults that had just entered society. However, as a result of this unique premise of having the main cast as high school girls, we are also presented with an opportunity to see the types of problems that both manga artists and teenagers such as the members of the main cast face. This combination of having the main cast experience not just the problems that they face in their professional lives such as the dreaded slump that many a manga artist and light novel author has felt as well as more personal problems like being afraid of attending book signings for your work due to being afraid of what your fans would feel at seeing your actual physical appearance I felt was well done as it allowed us to see the kind of problems both personal and professional that manga artists can feel as they both start and maintain their careers in the field of manga. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall story of the show I felt was also a strong point of the series as not only did it allow us to see the members of the main cast develop both as individuals and as manga artists but also allow us to see them doing so as they work alongside each other, bond with each other, have fun together and overcome problems together while at the same time not forgetting that at the end of the day they while professionals in their own right are still high school girls that are just at the beginning of their lives. Paired with this story is the strong chemistry that is established between Kaos and not just with her fellow manga artists but also with the many support staff that helps them in their everyday lives whether as high school students or as manga professionals. This chemistry when paired with the story is what really makes the story stand out as this allows us to see Kaos and the girls gradually mature as the series goes on both as individuals and as manga artists as they incorporate what they had learned from bonding with their friends into their work and improve not only themselves but also the work that they so cherish. One of the main themes of the series is, of course, the act of overcoming doubts and improving yourself to break your limits a theme that I felt was really appropriate for the series and handled really well within the series through the evolution of Kaos and the girls not just as manga artists but as individuals as well. Overall Comic girls was a series that I really enjoyed with its premise, story and the chemistry between its cast being the highlight of the series. As a final score, I would say that Comic girls would easily deserve a final score of 10/10 and is easily one of the best animes i seen this season. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "A few years ago, I asked myself if we\u2019ll ever get another series about characters making manga. Series like Bakuman and Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun are among some of the most entertaining anime I\u2019ve seen that explored such ideas. In recent years, we had series about cute girls making games like New Game! or even characters working in the anime industry like Shirobako. Now it\u2019s 2018 and we got Comic Girls. \r\nI\u2019ll say right off the bat that the series is about as simple as it sounds. It\u2019s an anime that explores the daily life misadventures of a group of female mangaka. For a series thatdeals with such a simple premise, the way it executes its storytelling is just as effective. At its core, the show uses its character cast to do the storytelling. Every day is an adventure of its own as we see how these characters interact and behave. In essence, the series provides the opportunity to showcase manga making in a very casual, everyday life environment.\\n\\n\r\nOur main characters consists of a group of young girls of similar age. They have nicknames and all have them different preferences in their manga tastes. For instance, Koyume prefer shoujo manga compared to other genres. Ruki loves ecchi and fan service in her work. Tsubasa\u2019s passion for shounen manga is also reflected in personality. Then, there\u2019s Kaoruko Moeta (Kaos) who just wants to improve herself as a manga artist after having her work met with overwhelming negative reception. The main selling point is how these characters are motivated to do what they love through their connections with each other. \\n\\n\r\nAs a fan of the manga, the adaptation is relatively faithful and brings the mood of the series to life. The lighthearted tone of every episode is what you can expect from most \u201ccute girls doing cute things\u201d shows. Now I\u2019ll be honest with you. If this type of show isn\u2019t what you\u2019re familiar with or a fan of, then it may be hard to enjoy this. There\u2019s not much character development despite the series exploring a life journey of these young mangaka. Storytelling on most parts is very simple and doesn\u2019t get any complicated as time goes on. Every episode has a repetitive nature and it feels like if you\u2019ve seen one, you\u2019ve seen them all. There are some characters the series brings in that occasionally spark more popcorn entertainment such as horror mangaka Suzu Fuura, Tsubasa\u2019s shounen style cosplays, and various misunderstandings. However, don\u2019t expect this series to be one that\u2019s dramatic or even competitive. In fact, the show is hardly about competition when it comes to manga craft but instead about characters working to improve themselves. The comedy is presented through reactions, character interactions, characters\u2019 behaviors. There\u2019s not much characterization although we do see some of the family backgrounds of the cast. In retrospect, these characters are pretty easy to understand along with the show itself.\\n\\n\r\nNexus is a studio that\u2019s probably known for its 2015\u2019s anime adaptation, Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry. While this series is nowhere near on that level of fan service, it still contains fan service and skinship. It\u2019s mainly mild and nothing too distracting. In some places, it\u2019s necessary as one of the mangaka wants to improve her skill of making \u201cteenage love\u201d manga. On a technical level, the series looks crisp with colorful quality and cute character designs. The series never hides Kao\u2019s shyness or Tsubasa\u2019s tomboy tendencies. Suzu Fuura and her mischievous personality is also animated with such intention. The series\u2019 character designs may also be misleading at times as such characters look older than they seem. Luckily, it doesn\u2019t hold them back as every characters\u2019 voice fits well with their persona. The theme songs for the show overall also contains the style of what slice of life should be with mangaka theatrics. \\n\\n\r\nComic Girls, the series about mangaka striving to improve their craft did what it needed to do and I didn\u2019t expect anything more. It\u2019s a simple series that capitalized on the chance to explore mangaka lifestyle. It succeeds doing that through the storytelling and can even occasionally surprise you. But if you\u2019re not a fan of this type of series, then it may be hard to look back and enjoy what it is. Still, give the show a chance and see what awaits you on the other side.\\n",

            "content": "The cute girls genre recieves a fantastic addition with Comic Girls, an anime I definitely didn't expect to be as good as it ended up being.\r\nThis story is focused on a group of girls who love manga and either draw one professionally, or are trying to get a series published. This proves to be difficult for our lovable protagonist, Kaos, who honestly is just awful at it, and goes to live in a dormitory for female manga artists where she meets the other main characters of the series, hopefully getting inspiration from them.\r\nComic Girls uses the setting really well to provide a fantastic comedy bothvia the characters and the use of the manga elements. This anime doesn't focus on the profession like series as Bakuman or Shirobako do, but it's still quite informative and, most importantly, succeeds at using it for the comedic value it wants.\\n\\n\r\nThere are four main characters in this story: our protagonist, Kaoruko Moeta (pen-name Kaos), who is an absurdly likeable and quite relatable girl who seems to be in constant state of panic, but is also a hard worker that you will want to adopt and protect, Tsubasa, a tomboyish girl who draws shounen manga and puts herself really seriously in the mind of the characters she creates, Ruki, who loves drawing cute things but ended up discovering her true skills at drawing lewd stuff instead to her embarassment, and Koyume, a cheerful shoujo manga artist and doughnut devourer who can't draw guys. Their personalities balance well and make for a lot of entertaining situations, and together with fantastic (and also quite touching at times) episodes focused on each character I ended up very attached to them. The number of secondary characters is pretty short but they do well when they appear and add to the fun that comes from this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style and character designs of the series are very visually appealing, with lots of nice character reactions and well done use of the camera angles, studio Nexus hasn't done many things yet but I would be totally in for them doing more series in the future because they never fail to deliver in terms of quality. The music on the other side is nothing memorable but fits well for the tone of the scenes, the opening and ending themes are two good songs by the VAs of the four protagonists, with the later having some really nice transitions into it at the end of some episodes.\\n\\n\r\nComic Girls is a fantastic series I enjoyed a lot and I really recommend to watch to any fan of the cute girls genre, or for anyone looking for a comedy series to watch, because this one delivers hard.\\n",

            "content": "Comic Girls fits in an interesting spot for CGDCT shows. While there is an abundance of CGDCT that manage to have nice light fluffy interactions but with little depth, it s rare to see a show like Comic Girls where the depth of the show is the highlight. With Comic Girls there is a lot of depth given to the characters, who they are, what they're aiming for, and the growth that they have as comic artists. While the characters do have their gimmicks and can seem a bit cliche at the start. There is much more to them than that. One thing I appreciateis that they all seem to be modeled off the genre of manga that they are writing. Koyume acts like a shoujo protagonist. Tsubasa acts like a shounen protagonist. Moeta acts like a combination between the typical CGDCT protagonist and its audience. While it does lead them to be more prototypical than they could be it also creates and interesting and humorous meta joke.\\n\\n\r\nBy itself that is nice but nothing special, but what is great is how it's used for their development and how their depth gets explored due to that. With Koyume, the shoujo mangaka, an empathsis on love is brought into her character arc, including her learning how it feels to actually be in love and the feelings that she has. With Ruki, a josei ecchi mangaka, she learns how to love herself and what she does even those it may seem shameful or something not to be proud of. With Moeta, the CGDCT mangaka, she learns how to have friends and be accepted by them as well as how to deal with all of her self-esteem issues. They all have issues that bring them to be more than just the meta archetypes that they start with. It makes them compelling as characters and their successes that much more satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nAnother interesting point in Comic Girls' depth is its yuri. While a lot of CGDCT like to do hints at yuri and make soft yuri ships, Comic Girls goes beyond that. There are explicit statements of love towards other girls as well as focus on those feelings. They aren't treated as a joke but rather with power and focus. Not only that but they're not content to just show it and have the fandom supply the rest. Comic Girls actually shows reasons why the two characters would fit together well, why they like each other, and how each other improves each other's lives. With a lot of romances it often feels like the main point is a statement of the characters being in love with each other rather than a focus on what makes them so good together. Comic Girls' eschews that by showing how the two help each other, and why they like each other. It makes for a very satisfying romance, when many other CGDCT only teased at one.\\n\\n\r\nInterestingly while Comic Girls manages to handle its depth well it does have an issue with it's more SOL moments. While these are usually the bread and butter of CGDCT shows, and is the easier parts for a show to do Comic Girls' SOL moments are pretty generic and standard. While the chemistry that the cast has goes a long way, the gimmicks are relied on a lot, and in general the jokes are nothing special, especially when compared to the large library of CGDCT works. Too often overused jokes are made, or the same material is riffed on over and over again.\\n\\n\r\nThat said I feel like the characters, and the great depthful moments more than make up for that. The art is also quite nice and the general finished product is a good one although not a spectacular one. \\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day I'd say Comic Girls is a really good CGDCT and one that any fan of CGDCT should happily pick up. It may not have the strongest jokes or fluff, but the overall combination of material is great.",

            "content": "Comic Girls was a pleasant surprise. I was a bit worried at the beginning of episode one when the show cut between a manga author and editor. I assumed it would be similar to Bakuman, a show I wasn't very fond of. Luckily, the show takes a unique turn in showing the daily lives of well-known manga author roommates instead of aspiring manga authors still living with their parents. The show is well designed, with care put into the backgrounds as well as the character designs. Each girl has a unique and rounded personality, separating them from tropes associated with the slice of life genre.Situations these characters are put into for humor are far different from most comedy anime, making for great some jokes. These girls also love their jobs more than anything, and are as much fans of the manga medium as they authors and artists. You can see the characters bond over this common interest, despite each girl's writing style being completely different and being at different stages in their careers. My only real gripe with this show other than the start of the first episode is putting all of these girls in school. Fortunately, the characters don't stay there long and both the girl's preparation for school and the school's design are very creative. I'm just a bit frustrated that this show couldn't just be about the lives of adults working creative jobs. Other than those very minor problems, this show was surprisingly entertaining. I'd recommend this to any manga fan or anyone looking for a slice of life comedy to fill their time.",

            "content": "To be honest, I really enjoy Shoujo manga/anime. And yes this anime very enjoyable. The story is telling us about shoujo mangakas (girls making manga) daily live. For someone loves shoujo manga can already imagine core of this anime, girl's life.\r\nStory 7/10\r\nI know shoujo manga/anime sometime can be so bored cuz many of them only focus on 'moe-moe' and do any plot to make character more 'moe-moe'. In this anime, yes still moe is important dishes, but the story, shoujo mangaka is a good one. Not so tasteless, but there's some crisp on it.\r\nArt 8/10\r\nYes, this about moe. Shoujo anime must be moe! Definitely! Andthe background effect is pretty good I think. Animation just soso, no battle scene, nothing must be noticeable.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10)\\n\r\nMoe voice? Yes please! Some of seiyuu (voice actor) already popular. But one of the main characters is a fresh one. But still, very nice.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (8/10)\\n\r\nUnique personality for each character is very good! And it makes a daily life joke which very enjoyable and crisp.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10)\\n\r\nActually I want to give it 10/10. But I'm a big fan of shoujo manga/anime, so let's just minus one it. If you love moe character, scene full of woman, just dive in! If you want some lite story and enjoyable, just put your ass down and start watching.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10)\\n\r\nIt's a good anime to relax with. If you still consider it, just imagine a world of moe where you can watch all of moe interact with each other with a different moe personality. It's about MOE!",

            "content": "I feel this anime really appeals to me as an artist. As an artist in high school myself, I feel I have some girls to relate to. I've wanted to try making my own manga, and now this anime seems to be teaching me some techniques that I will use.\r\nStory 6/10:\r\n The story overall isn't fantastic, but that kind of is the point! Kaoroku Moeta (or Kaos-chan) is a high school student who is a struggling artist. She moves into a dormitory for other female mangaka to get inspiration and learn new techniques and get a serialized manga. The anime follows Kaos and her newfriends Konome (a shoujo artist who can't draw male characters), Tsubasa (a shonen mangaka who got her first series published and has a bit of a tendency to imitate her characters), and Rukki (a hentai artist who wants to draw kids manga) on their daily lives juggling school, serialized manga, fans, self-esteem issues, and improving drawing skills. It's meant to focus on the little things, as this is also a comedy anime. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThe art is important in a show on this topic, and Comic Girls delivers in that. Characters look distinct, have various facial expressions, and personality shown in their movements. Some side characters like animals even have this established (Nyaos is a prime example). All drawings shown that are created by the girls are well done (even the intentionally bad ones, as they are used for comedy making them good for their job), and some of the techniques used can easily be replicated. (DM me with some tips as I am trying to make my own manga too lol)\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nAll characters have fitting voices. The actors all do a really good job. Shoutouts to Takahashi Rie, the actor of Tsubasa, as this tone she uses is different to how I last heard her voice in a anime (Takagi San). The OPs and EDs also have good musical composition. Every time a character appears on screen in the OP or ED, their voice is heard singing (I'm imagining this with JOJO as Ono Daisuke tried to sing the OP and failed hilariously.) All these actresses are amazing at their job in singing and acting. It is so weird tho hearing Takahashi sing in character as she usually doesn't sing in the more monotone voice. Also the action music that plays with Tsubasa's impersonations is hilarious.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\r\nThese characters are so relatable to me.\\n\\n\r\nKaos: Young struggling mangaka who can't draw well. She is also shy and easily scared. Also she openly is a bit homosexual lmao. (Reminds me of a younger me)\\n\\n\r\nKonome: Kaos' best friend. She is energetic and this bounces off well with Kaos. A sort of Ryuji-Akira sort of vibe, in where they are so different but they like each other and support each other type of thing. Konome draws shoujo manga, but can't draw male characters. (Tbh i have a similar problem due to my art style). Her bubbly personality reminds me of myself.\\n\\n\r\nTsubasa: MY WAIFU. SHE IS MINE! (second to Sheska) Tsubasa is a shonen mangaka (hmmmm that's what I'm doing) who impersonates characters (kinda like I DO), and is a bit cold but loving (like when i had crippling depression). Tsubasa is more experienced than Kaos and Konome, and is willing to help them out and teach them new techniques, and even help out with finances (^o^). 10/10 waifu for me! Just need her to Jojo pose once and then she'd be number 1.\\n\\n\r\nRukki \"Big Boobies\u2665Himeko Chan\": The master of hentai herself. Rukki is really perverted (she draws hardcore porno), imagines her friends doing it, and ends up looking like she is having sex on multiple occasions. She claims to have big titties as a mangaka, but she is depressed that she is actually flat. She also writes teen romances, but mostly P O R N.  Rukki wants to draw a kids manga, but is too perverse to do so. (TBH she reminds me of my addiction with this pervy stuff) She is a nice girl and is understanding and a bit of a mentor to Kaos. KaoRukki I ship it! Her pen name is Big Boobies\u2665Himeko Chan.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall I am enjoying this series a lot! After the anime finishes, I will read the manga, and pray for season 2, and a dub so I can get a Blu Ray release in my local tech store. I'm going to also take the tips I've learned and build up the courage to release my own manga. I'm hoping I can be successful like these girls are (and trying to surpass themselves), and as an artist, this anime is a must watch. Also its fucking hilarious. \\n\\n\\n\r\n(This review will be updated once any announcements are made, and once I complete the current season. The score won't change much, but some minor details in the review may be tweaked)\\n\\n",

            "content": "Comic Girls is one of the most overlooked shows of the Spring 2018 season. At the time of this writing, it ranks in as the #16 new TV series of the season on MAL based on the number of members attached to it. I\u2019m sure that a large part of this is due to many \u201cserious\u201d anime fans dismissing moe, slice of life, cute girls doing cute things (CGDCT) shows on reflex. But I feel that this show deserves much more recognition than its getting, not just from slice of life fans, but from anime fans in general.\r\nComic Girls is part of the \u201ccute girls+ activity\u201d sub-genre of CGDCT shows which K-ON! largely brought into style. In this show, the activity that these cute girls are taking part in is creating manga. While the series doesn\u2019t go as deep into manga production as a series like Bakuman, drawing manga is definitely a more significant part of the story than the music in K-ON! and the activities of many other shows of this type. If you are interested in how manga is made but felt that Bakuman was a little too dry (and if you think it could be improved by cute girls), then this might be a great alternative for you.\\n\\n\r\nSo let\u2019s go ahead and get into my category breakouts:\\n\\n\r\n-----Story - 9 out of 10-----\\n\r\nThe story centers around four girls as they work on their respective (individual) manga careers in a dormitory specifically set up for young manga artists. The story mainly focuses on Kaos-sensei, a very small high school girl who gets sent to the dorm by her editor when she\u2019s having trouble producing anything good. She had a debut one-shot manga published which wasn\u2019t particularly well received. She joins two established manga artists who both have ongoing series in serialization as well as a fellow newcomer. Being that this is largely a true slice of life series in form, not much in the way of actual \u201cplot\u201d goes on. Most of the story revolves around Kaos sucking, the other girls working and dealing with their production schedules, or just regular old everyday life stuff. However, in the context of the kind of story that is being told, it\u2019s all rather well done. The comedy is well-paced with tight delivery and there is a steady stream of heartfelt moments. There are a few spots that are a little slower than they really needed to be (the final episode or two comes to mind), but the payoff was almost always worth it.\\n\\n\r\n-----Art - 9 out of 10-----\\n\r\nTrue slice of life shows tend to be some of the least demanding in the art department. There are usually no grand landscapes or crazy effects or action sequences. However, Comic Girls still does a rather exceptional job in this regard. To go along with the manga theme, the art direction of the series tends to have a heavily manga-inspired look with cool cuts and panel-windows inserted on the screen. It works very well and the overall look of the series is fun and clean. They also don\u2019t cut any corners when it comes to the presentation of the different girls\u2019 manga art as they all have their own distinct styles. The animation of their manga production is also very good, showing both traditional and digital production in natural and believable ways. The cuts to drawing manga never looks bad and never breaks immersion.\\n\\n\r\n-----Sound - 9 out of 10-----\\n\r\nThe sound direction for Comic Girls is rather solid. The opening and ending theme songs are good and the score is nice. But where these kinds of shows really need to shine is in the voice acting and Comic Girls does not disappoint. All of the characters are voiced with feeling and they all seem to fit the characters well. You really sense the excitement when the girls are talking about their passions as well as how down they feel when something isn\u2019t going quite right. It is all just very well done.\\n\\n\r\n-----Characters - 10 out of 10-----\\n\r\nThe success of slice of life and especially CGDCT shows absolutely hinges on their characters. Luckily, the characters in this series and their interactions with each other are all just wonderful! From the moment that we see Kaos, her weird small cuteness is evident, emphasized with her almost comical ability to attract animals. Koyume\u2019s peppy airheaded nature is a lot of fun to watch as is her love for another character.... Tsubasa\u2019s passion for her long-running shounen manga is exciting and funny to watch at the same time and it makes her sparse moments of distress all the more amusing. Then Ruki\u2019s concern over making a series in a genre that she is embarrassed by (smut) and not really fitting the image of someone you\u2019d expect to write such things (being an inexperienced high school girl with an unimpressive figure) causes her much more stress than it should while she is still able to maintain the status of being the most mature and well-put-together of the main four. The series also has a great supporting cast with very fun adults and a fifth girl who is one year older than the rest and not seen much because of \u201creasons\u201d. The characters are truly all great fun and if you connect with them, it will make the series for you.\\n\\n\r\n-----Enjoyment - 10 out of 10-----\\n\r\nI loved this series. Despite some minor pacing issues and maybe not going into enough detail with some of the story elements than it could have, everything just worked for me in the end. As I score based purely on enjoyment, this did end up getting a 10 from me on my personal list. Other than just getting immersed in the lives of these girls, I was also able to relate to a lot of the art elements as someone who did draw regularly in the past (especially in high school). While they don\u2019t go particularly deep into the production of manga, I feel that there is enough here for anyone who has ever attempted to draw in any serious or semi-serious fashion to relate to. Early on the girls talk about things that they are just not very good at drawing and there are also instances of procrastination and just not knowing what to draw. While there are a lot of funny moments in the series, it also feels genuine, coming from a place of love and not just being some cash-in or purely an advertisement for the source manga.\\n\\n\r\n-----Overall - 9 out of 10 (Conclusion)-----\\n\r\nWell, in case it isn\u2019t clear already, I think this series is great. While it does stumble at times, I feel that everything else in the series makes up for it. If you enjoy this kind of show, it is definitely worth seeing. Let yourself get taken in by the characters and laugh and cry and smile ear-to-ear like an idiot. Now, would this be enough to convert the \u201cserious\u201d anime fans to the joys of CGDCT? Eh, probably not; they\u2019ll most likely have their minds made up going in and not be able to see this as anything but the pointless moe dribble that is RUINING ANIME!! But for anyone else who can just let themselves watch something nice without any kind of earth-shattering plot, keep an open mind, and enjoy the lives of some cute girls, then you shouldn\u2019t be disappointed, especially if you\u2019ve ever enjoyed creating art of your own.",

            "content": "Remember the archetype forms that we have come to know and love or hate all these years? More recently, the \"Cute Girls Doing Cute Things\" genre has set off recent classics such as Madhouse's amazing \"A Place Further Than The Universe\" last season and much earlier, to Passione's \"Hinako Note\" in the same season last year. This season introduces us to Comic Girls, which tells us the tales of 4 mangaka girls, each with their own aspirations to make it big in the comic zone (and potentially get their hard work paid out in the process).\r\nThe series core is as simple as it can comeclose to, but don't dismiss it as bad, because it is wholesomely good and holds well on its own. And who doesn't mid a simple premise yet the storytelling does the rest of its job maintaining the direction of the series? I'll take that any day than some convoluted storylines which only make sense towards the ending of some series (*cough* Dances of the Dragons \"cough*). At the very core, this series teaches us the ups and downs of life being mangaka, because in real-life Japan, while replicating as faithful as the manga adaptation was, it is a direct but not perfect exact situation. HOWEVER, what Comic Girls was able to slap with was some moments of literally comical-drawn scenes and some yuri (but thankfully not too much) scenes but what I loved is how everything comes together to form a single imperfect but pretty representation overall.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters (Kaos, Tsubasa, Ruki, Koyume plus the illusive Fuura) all are really likeable on their own AND as a whole. Kaos being the childlike newcomer, learning the ropes from experienced mangaka, Tsubasa with her action sequences, earning her the name \"V-Wing Senpai\", Ruki with her calm, composed yet flushed expressions, Koyume whose mindfulness rests on her health (bulging stomach) but still focuses on yuri manga (light-hearted) and the ghost-like Fuura which scares the heck of the cast every now and then. Overall, they mesh well together and as one, they overcome the extremes of being mangaka and are able to have quality time together regardless of the circumstances and that's pretty satisfying to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation is comical-like (you see the relation?), bringing the title to relation. For one, studio Nexus is a newly founded studio in recent years, whose reputation lies in the OK-made Wakaba Girl back in 2015 and the excellent \"Calvary of a Failed Knight\" (also in 2015). So you could discount this as a new studio...BUT! For another, their work on this series IS impressive to boot, bringing their prowess from Calvary over to here, and I've gotta say, the art and animation is what hooked me into this series in the first place. It's just so beautiful and well-made, even the comical-drawn-esque scenes were well done with the classical character model faces made to replicate as mangaka would draw on comic grid paper. Another point that's seeing the effort of the people behind this series, absolutely marvelous.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is something else too. For one, I absolutely have a love-hate relationship on the OST being handled by the cast and/or crew of series gone by, probably because they sound mediocre but decent at the same time, and this series broke my convention and having the OST delivered nicely is something I appreciate so much about this series. Yes, it's THE cast of the Comic Girls, but I love the OST here so much so that's it's energetic and calming respectively (for OP and ED).\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the elephant in the room? I'm really quite sad that this series is underrated and underappreciated, just by the initial looks of it that people cast of as an generic anime and forgot about it. So take my word, try this series out and see how much it can surprise you by having less characters, a simple story and pretty good OST, and how everything combined forms a picture of a thousand words. Yet another CGDCT, BUT it's a well done CDGCT, a blast to watch and time well spent.",

Sadly, all of her storyboards are rejected and she can't get her chapter into a magazine. Then, she got to know about the dorm for female manga artists, who wants to work together. Moeta decides to go there, and then she meets her dorm friends - Tsu-chan, Rukki, Koyume and later, Fuura-san.

I liked everything about it, the anatomy was on point and the characters weren't lifeless.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10:\\n\r\nThere weren't many soundtracks in this anime but the opening, ending and some soundtracks were really great.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10:\\n\r\nThey were absolutly briliant and amazing. Let me introduce you to them:\\n\\n\r\nKaoruko Moeta - the main protagonist. She's a typical moe, she apologies for everything and she works really hard to have her manga in the magazine. She's cheerful, happy but her motivation is really low and she's emotionaly unstable. Her type of manga is shojo, slice of life and chibi and 4-koma. Her pen name is Chaos.\\n\\n\r\nTsubasa ,,Tsu-chan'' Katsuki - She's usually quiet, don't express emotions that much, but when she goes to her cosplay time... She literally turns herself to a typical shounen-character.Her manga is on-going and the type of it is shounen. Her pen name is Wing-V.\\n\\n\r\nRuki ,,Rukki' Irokawa - the most mature girl in the dorm. She's calm, nice and loves to help others. Her pen name is Big Boobies\u2665Himeko even tho her breasts aren't big. At first, she wanted to draw cute, animal mangas for children but her manager said that her ability to draw characters with big breasts was really good and now she draws erotic manga.\\n\\n\r\nKoyume Koizuka - a typical deredere. Always happy, cheerful and loves sweets. She really adores Tsu-chan and she doesn't know if it's love or not. Her type of manga is shojo and romance. Her pen name is Koisuru Koyume.\\n\\n\r\nSuzu Fuura - she appear out of nowhere, really. Her manga type is horror so she's stylizing herself to be like a ghost. She loves screams of the other dorm girls and likes to scare them, but it just means that she really loves her friends and admires them, she's kind of a yandere. She really loves to help others. Even tho she loves scary stuff, she's scared of thunder.  It is said that she lives in the same area as Moeta lives. She's not very popular and her pen name wasn't revealed.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10:\\n\r\nI really loved watching this show. The jokes were good, the characters wasn't emotionless and they were just having fun. Also it was really great to watch the work of the mangakas and their usual problems (deadlines, not having motivation etc.). It never been boring to me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10:\\n\r\nI really reccomend this show for people who are interested on how the mangakas works, who are interested in cute girls doing cute stuff, highschool life (even tho most of the action takes place in the dorm). This was one of the best slice of life series that i've ever watched! \\n\\n",

            "content": "I started watching this from the very first episode. But due to me starting to read LN, I got more interested in reading than watching. Now that I've mostly caught up. I've come back and finished this gem.\r\nThis is honestly, My favorite show of the season. With only one other show I found interest in. It's not that surprising.\r\nThe characters in this I really like. I ended up associating their hair-color more to their names than their actual names. For example. \r\nI call characters \r\nPurple-Hair-Girl > Ruki\r\nBlonde-Hair-Girl ( Also could be Yellow-Hair-Girl )> Koyume \r\nBlue-Hair-Girl > Katsuki\r\nBlack-Hair-girl > Fuura\r\nPink-Hair-Girl < Kaos \r\nThe names besides Kaos'sname weren't really that rememberable. So I ended up usually calling them by their most unique characteristic\\n\\n\r\nI like Kaos. She is probably the MC of the MC's. Although she usually isn't as focused on. I like her really pervy side while also being really innocent. She will always be filled with joy when being hugged by the other girls. I do end up feeling kind of bad for her that she is so small. I like imagining that off-screen she has a massive growth spurt and at least becomes as tall as the other girls. I'd love if they went away for summer and when they come back, Kaos Is a giant girl with big boobs and what not, Just so I could see their reaction, I'd imagine that Ruki would get a ton of... Material for her manga work.\\n\\n\r\nRuki Is probably my favorite if not then 2nd favorite right next to Kaos. I like her character and personality. I also love how she only really exceeds in drawing Porn even though she's more of what you'd call the level-headed one. There are plenty of Yuri themes in this. But I do think both Ruki and Kaos are the best together.\\n\\n\r\nKoyume Isn't a bad character. But I have seen her character before in other anime. So I don't have too much to say. She's the airhead of the group and has a crush on Katsuki.  She also loves food, That's mostly her character. She's still fun to have on screen. But boiled down and she seems kind of basic.\\n\\n\r\nFuura Is probably my 3rd favorite even with her having the least amount of screen time. Her character fits her genre of music (Horror) I'd say that both her and Ruki are probably the most attractive of the group. I do think both Ruki and Fuura would also be a good couple tbh. I have trouble deciding if I like Ruki and Kaos more or if I like Furra and Ruki more. So I decided to just settle it and say fuck it, We're going the Harem route.\\n\\n\r\nKatsuki Is probably my least favorite of the group. I do find things I like about her. But she didn't interest me from the start. So with the story focusing so much on her tell around episode 7. My dislike seems to have grown more. When I look back, She's bad. She has funny moments. It's just during the time with having stuff shoved down my throat. I eventually got annoyed. I always like Tomboy characters. But she just doesn't do it well. I think her character would be more interesting If she was a very girlish girl but she tries to act like a Tomboy for her stories or whatever. When she was acting girly, I think she was actually pretty interesting.\\n\\n\r\nI noticed from around episode 10 or 11 tell the end, That the creators got really creative with the animation. It was honestly a nice sudden change from the usual calm animation you'd expect from a show of this genre. \\n\\n\r\nI do find episode 11 and 12 to be kind of depressing with them moving out and them seeing all the other Manga artist that have already grown up. I felt that was a little down but then we got to the very end of episode 12.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, This show is pretty good and much more then what I'd expect with such a premise.\\n",

The story is simple and easy to follow. The characters are loveable and well designed, even has one of my favourite supporting characters of all time. The art is beautiful and pretty cute at times. Sound is also prettygood, for reasons I can not really say without spoiling a bit.\\n\\n\r\nThis Anime made me cry, it made me laugh and fall in love. And that is really all that matters. Would 100% recommend to give this a watch.",

I found myself enveloped in the anime and it's world filled with colourful characters and scenery as it enabled me to sit down and relax, absorbing the cheerful, light-hearted atmosphere of it's medium. \r\nThe storyline wasn't boring in any sense, although, a bit cliche at times perhaps, but interesting to the level that i'd stayed hooked to the anime's various characters, all with their different niches and internal struggles. After a while, I had found myself subconsciously becoming attached to thefour main characters of the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe art style seemed quite appropriate for the setting and the demeanour of the show, light; yet not overly simplistic. The soundtrack followed a similar path, enjoyable, but nothing overly substantial for the quality of Comic Girls. I did not expect to enjoy this anime to the level that I did, and I recommend it to everyone who wants a light and interesting slice of life watch.",

            "content": "*Sorry for my bad english\r\nI doubt why this anime's reviews have people give so much score? My personal opinions I think this anime overrated.\r\nStory is simple, about four girl in manga's dormitory. If you expect this anime will be like bakuman or about manga's industry, I said nope. This anime will be like generic cute girl do cute things with content there can find in other that in same genres. For short this anime is only about 4 girls manga writer's life in dormitory. \r\nArt and Music is good. I'm enjoy with them.\r\nEvery characters in this anime will be different stereotype live together, If thiscan make charm from these stereotype will be okay, but result is every character is very annoying. Like they hired to make every action to match their stereotype. So much is Moeta and Katsuki. Moeta is one character is same since episode 1 to episode 12, I know she has develop in the end and that is very slowwwwwwww I think I will be annoy her for first, She should be like in the end episode since episode 5 or 6. But thing this anime make well is distributing characters' story. If I'm not interested in personality I think they have interesting background's story. Unfortunately If this anime more emphasize with this, I think I will like this anime.\\n\r\nThing I feel annoying from this anime is drama that swtich with comedy in every episode in level make tone in watching broken. For Example.\\n\r\n(Every Character do something and make we laugh)\\n\r\nOne Character: Oh I have bad past bla bla ba\\n\r\n(Sad Music come)\\n\r\nOverall, This anime are not too bad, If you like cute girl do cute things or kira kira girls you may be like this anime. But It's bad and boring for me.\\n\r\nScore:3 two from art/music and one from background stroy of every character.",

            "content": "Adapted from a manga series,Comic Girls surely tries to bring the pain and struggle of the manga Industry into an anime,together with its own style.Although keeping its own style is important,they should also consider whether it'd be a great idea from a general anime perspective.By now,it somehow shows its uniqueness,but doesn't feature Comic Girls really well.\r\n+good opening and ending song\r\n+diversified characters' personalities \r\n+Hilarious and crazy characters' actions\r\n+nice character reactions\r\n+Ending summed up the story\r\n-it feels episodic \r\n-Bad story premise\r\n-story feels shattered because characters work on their own\r\n-repetitive or overused ideas \r\n-undeveloped characters\r\n-poor transitions\r\nAt my first glance,I was really excited about Comic Girls,I saw cute girls,beautiful visualswith characters with different personalities,I also received servals laughters too.With such a great start,Comic Girls could be potential.However,it starts to get lame and boring later on,which I couldn't grow on the characters or the story anymore.\\n\\n\r\nThe main problem of Comic Girls is its presentation.At first,I was supposed that the characters in Comic Girls are working together,but in fact,they're just working on their own.Although sometimes they managed to help each other,at the end the main focus would be just onto one or two characters.Therefore,there're not much remarkable character interactions.Moreover,The story feels extremely inconsistent.It feels episodic,each episode doesn't have any sort of relationship towards others,many weird transitions all over the place.Sometimes,it has comedy moments,but then it suddenly jumps to emotional moments.In other time,it seems to be concentrated on one character,but then it talks about another character,which seems the story is going to nowhere and I don't know what exactly Comic Girls wants to express through each episode.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition,the character development doesn't seem to be good.Although each girl has their own personality,they feel pretty unrealistic and undeveloped.The setting that a bunch of highschool girls that are manga authors as well is a poor story premise for a slice of life anime,as this would be very unlikely happened in reality from a general perspective.In addition,there are also several unrealistic moments in Comic Girls as well.For example,teacher suddenly drags a student out of the classroom and said to him,I like your drawing.It feels very weird and abnormal.Apart from the characters just working on their own,the main storyline is just Kaos improving on her work.Other time,other main characters are just supporting cast,while only a few moments focusing on them.At the end,I just grew on a little on Kaos,but not for the others.\\n\\n\r\nI find that the comedy delivered to me is kinda funny and boring at the same time.At first,I get a lot of laughters because of the hilarious and crazy characters' reactions.Unfortunately,by the more episodes you have watched,it will become lame and flat,as ideas are becoming repetitive and overused.Characters feel jealous about other characters' boob size,scared of things and being sleepy during classes,it feels cliche,repetitive and boring,so overall the comedy offered in this show is unsatisfactory.If the comedy and ideas used in the show are refreshing and new,it'll be more interesting.Sadly,it doesn't happen in Comic Girls.\\n\\n\r\nAfter a long and rough ride,I finally come to the ending.The good news is that Comic Girls somehow manages to summarise the story events and the story ending is quite fine for a slice of life anime.\\n\\n\r\nFinally,let's talk about the animation and the sound in this show.I'm kind of impressed with the animation in this show. Colourful visuals are used and cute moments in a comic style,looks original and nice,together with different cute character reactions.It is kinda nice,but if more visuals are used on the background would be better.Voice actors are trying to play their roles well,opening and ending are nice and interesting with its own style.I noticed some background music and soundtracks in this show,but if there're more of them used in the show,it'll be greater.\\n\\n\r\nUnless you're in a similar position as the character,you probably won't able to get much enjoyment from this show.Although Comic Girls tries to attempt a great story with hilarious moments,it feels like a total mess and a failed work at the end,except for the ending.Therefore,many improvements and efforts are needed in order to develop a better and an amusing slice of life,comedy anime.\\n\\n\r\nI used to love slice of life and comedy anime,but not this one apparently.\\n\\n\r\nStory:5/10 (D) (35%)\\n\r\nAnimation:8/10 (A) (10%)\\n\r\nSound:7/10 (B) (10%)\\n\r\nCharacters:4/10 (E) (25%)\\n\r\nEnjoyment:5/10 (D) (20%)\\n\r\nOverall:5/10 (D) (Fair)",

            "content": "Now this was a surprising anime. I went in expecting your typical \u201ccute girls doing cute things\u201d moe slice of life comedy that we seem to get at least every season. And it was in fact a \u201ccute girls doing cute things\u201d moe slice of life comedy. I\u2019m already extremely partial to these type of shows and it\u2019s really hard to make them not enjoyable (With the exception Hinako Note. I\u2019m falling asleep just thinking about that one.) Comic Girls follows 4 manga artists who all move into a dormitory to work on their original stories and attend school. Surprisingly, the whole school aspect ofComic Girls isn\u2019t really embraced that much. There are a few scenes to be had in this environment, but most of the fun happens in the dorms or out in the city. From the get go, Comic Girls lets you know that you will love each and every character in this anime. All four of them manage to be so lovable and fun to see interact with one another. Kaos (The definite main character) should be protected and kept happy at all costs because she deserves to be loved and cherished. She\u2019s a 4-koma manga artist who struggles being... Well, good at manga. Tsubasa is an athletic tomboy who really only cares about her popular Shounen manga series. When she gets into writing, she dons the outfit of the hero of her manga to hype herself up. Ruki is s rather innocent and serious manga artist who despite wanting to stick with children stories, somehow ended up writing more erotic ones, much to her disappointment. Koyume is another up and coming manga artist who\u2019s always energized, peppy, and writes romance manga (She also has a crush on Tsubasa, so that\u2019s a plus.)\\n\r\nAll the characters have different methods when it comes to writing their stories, how they prepare, how they relax, and how they help one another. All four look out for one another and become genuine friends quickly. \\n\r\nThe comedy always hits its mark. There\u2019s never a joke that goes by that isn\u2019t at least worth an inner laugh. Yet the anime also manages to add in very touching moments. It finds the perfect balance of when to be funny and when to get emotional. While the animation isn\u2019t anything too special, Comic Girls does this thing where it\u2019ll suddenly appear like a manga panel on screen which can add to the charm and humor in some cases.\\n\r\nWhile it doesn\u2019t have the biggest focus on what goes into making a manga itself, it still shows how time consuming and stressful it can be, especially since the c at are all high schoolers. By the end of the anime, they all have grown in their own way in order to make their manga better than ever. You get to see how they improve and the strides they make as manga artists. It was filled with lovable characters, had great humor, great chemistry among the cast, and surprisingly touching moments. This is an anime I will genuinely miss seeing each week. I haven\u2019t heard much about the source material, but if there\u2019s enough to work with, I would be so damn happy to see Comic Girls make a return someday. We need more Adventures of Kaos-chan.",

            "content": "I might spoil the show when analyzing the characters. So don't read if you haven't watched the show! Unless you don't care...\r\nI am an artist. It may seem like I'm bragging, sorry if it does, but it is pretty important to my enjoyment for this show. Cause even though every artist doesn't have the same experiences, there are things that many artists do feel. \r\nBeing ashamed of oneself work, not feeling deserving of food and other self-destructive thoughts. \r\nI have never really seen an anime about art that shows this side of how artists feel. There are probably other shows that do this. Maybe evenshows I have seen that do this. But this is the show that has made me remember that part the most. Cause the artist part in many anime characters is irrelevant in most cases. The character might be memorable, but the fact that they're an artist isn't. It isn't important for the character that they are an artist.\\n\r\nI'm not saying that a character should change because of a hobby they have. But that's kind of what it is. To most artist characters I have seen, it is just a hobby. Again, this is fine. But for me to really resonate with an artist character, the art part should be their personality. They're hobby effects them as a person. That might sound weird. But it is the one thing that makes me like Comic girls so much.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIn the show, Moeta moves into a dorm with exclusively artist. This was a way for her to gain experience from these artists. To find inspiration. But as I see it, I wouldn't say that living there was particularly good for her. Yes, she finds very good friends and the ending might have been different if she didn't live there. But, Moeta doesn't really feel good living there, even though the friend she makes, makes her happy. Cause as I said before, there are things that artist do when they're not happy with their work. And living with two artists that already have serialized works, this feeling is only amplified. As Moeta lives in the dorm, she does a lot of self-destructive things. She stays up all night to finish her comic ideas, that she knows will inevitably be trashed. She rejects food since she doesn't feel deserving of it. Of course, she doesn't even have a serialized comic yet. \\n\\n\r\nAnd as an artist, I resonated with her a lot. All of the feelings she gets around her art is something me and a lot of artists feel. I can tell that an artist wrote the story. \\n\\n\r\nAnd she wasn't the only artist that was written so well. We also have Ruki and Tsubasa. While they weren't as relatable, they were still really good. While Tsubasa doesn't have any particularly bad feelings against her art (At least from what we know), her parents do. They are very much against her drawing. That's why she moves to the dorm so that her parents wouldn't shame her. \\n\r\nRuki also experiences something a lot of artists do. When becoming an artist, her agent sees how attractive her art style. She advises her to draw more attractive manga since her art style compliments this genre. This leads to her being successful as a hentai artist. And while she tries to implement a romance aspect into the comics, that doesn't help her self-image. The fact that she's a hentai artist kills her. It's only when she meets her fans and she sees how much they care for her story that her self-respect gets better. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSadly, this was only how I felt in the beginning When we stopped learning about their insecurities, the story gets a lot more boring. We keep seeing Moeta's self-destructive nature from time to time. But it wasn't as interesting as before. \\n\\n\\n\r\nBut because of my bias, I will give this show an 8. I would have given it a 7 before. But the very accurate depiction of artists was just so interesting to see. \\n\\n\r\nWeak 8/10",

            "content": "**** SHORT REVIEW (Kind of)****\r\nAs an casual anime watcher who usually despises Moe based anime , I didn't really expect anything good from this series when i started watching but this series proved me wrong and completely surprised me !! \r\nComic girls is a light-hearted comedy/ slice of life anime where the story revolves around the daily lives of female mangakas and tries to explains the effort behind creating a successful manga/comic series. \r\nFeel free to scroll down to the \"overall \" and \"pros and cons\" section.\r\nNow, lets cut right to chase shall we?\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nA simple yet interesting story which revolves around a girl namedKaoruko Moeta who moves into a dormitory to improve her manga where she meets other female mangaka of the same age. The story takes you on a road trip around the daily lives of the mangakas with perfectly timed comedy and beautifully portrayed and well timed emotional scenes. Overall, I really loved the story but I felt as a slice of life anime it should have been more realistic (the amount of kindness shown towards main character is absurd and unrealistic!! but of-course this is just my opinions :P). But other than that its a well deserved 9/10 for the story.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nThis is by far the most captivating part of the anime,the art style is moe with bright and delicately colored backgrounds which perfectly blends with the anime itself. The animation is smooth,colorful and realistic which makes you feel like you right beside the characters experiencing the moment. After a very long time I got the thought :- \"the art can't get any better than this.\". Easily a 10/10 for me.\\n\r\n(Studio Nexus nailed it here)\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThe opening and ending themes perfectly match the feels from the anime. And the ost and voices of the characters were splendidly done and well placed. 9/10 here.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nI never thought I would say this but the character were well developed and well portrayed for a 12-episode anime ,even the support characters were used exceptionally well. Each character had their own individual traits and very interesting backgrounds.\\n\r\nA very well deserved 9/10 here.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nAt no point of the episodes was i bored or even looked away from the screen. I was completely immersed into the show so again 10/10 here.(The fresh art style,story and character completely immersed me into the show)\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 9/10\\n\r\nIf you have ever felt you needed to take a break/escape from common psychological,horror,...etc genre of anime, I recommend you watch this series because it will leave you with a refreshed and calm mindset with a warm and cozy feeling in your heart. But I felt that it follows the usual high school girl path which disappointed a little since I wanted an adult perspective of being a mangaka but other than that the anime nailed it and hence the score.\\n\\n\r\n*(By the way if you are interested in knowing how a manga is made and what type of dedication it requires i highly recommend you watch this anime)*\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is definitely on my \"recommended\" list.\\n\\n\\n\r\nPROS:\\n\r\n1) Interesting story\\n\r\n2) Well-timed comedy moments\\n\r\n3) Characters were well voiced and portrayed\\n\r\n4) Art/Animation is beautiful\\n\r\n5) Ending was satisfactory\\n\r\n6) Moe\\n\\n\r\nCONS:\\n\r\n1) Moe (Yes, both negative and positive of the show)\\n\r\n2) Same old High Schooler's perspective (though we do get adult-perspectives of being a mangaka at the end)\\n\\n\r\nP.S  (\"May contain a lot of grammatical errors and still a beginner at reviews\")\\n\r\n*****************************************************************************\\n",

            "content": "Bakuman....MOE Edition.\r\nComic Girls is another in the line of \"working girls\" anime but this time in becoming a pro mangaka. The comparisons towards Bakuman is probably just at the surface level of  making manga and all the trials and tribulations\", seeing that Comic Girls is a Manga Kirara Time work, the competition aspect is barely there, instead more about friendship and camaraderie of helping bring manga's to life in this anime.\r\nKaoruko \"Kaos\" Moeta voiced by Hikaru Akae is our resident narrative focus of the anime and we do get a plotline of her growing as a mangaka and learning it from her dorm friends.She is also the typically shy and extremely nervous character of the core cast and has a REAL habit of crying whenever she does something bad (or even a jabby compliment gets to her) though LA can relate to her through her shyness. Koyume Koizuka voiced by Kaede Hondo is a fledging shoujo mangaka and is your genki character of the core cast, she has a crush on Tsubasa that also helps with her shoujo romance manga and even uses this as reference for her manga as a result as well. Tsubasa Katsuki voiced by Rie Takahashi is your tomboyish-chunni character that makes shounen manga and even has her manga in publication already but she has to hide her identity to the public because of it. Lastly and LA's favorite character is Ruki Irokawa voiced by Saori Oonishi an ecchi romance mangaka and is your ojou and the voice of reason out of the main cast. All four of them gets some sort of development, whether it be about their home life, manga woes throughout the anime and mostly the development is spread pretty evenly in LA's eyes.\\n\\n\r\nHeck even the minor characters gets some limelight episodes, like the fifth member of the dorm being Suzu Fuura voiced by Reina Ueda, a horror mangaka, the dorm matron Ririka Hanazono voiced by Aya Endou and Mayu Amisawa voiced by Minami Tsuda, Kaos' editor.\\n\\n\r\nThis being a Manga Time Kirara work, yes, this is moe as hell, the yuri subtexts between the core cast are blatant and mostly a slice of life perspective towards seeing the day to day life of mangaka (and to be precise, a Manga Time Kirara one at that), but coming from the experiences of a once Manga Time Kirara mangaka (Kaori Hanzawa), that would make sense to draw (and write) what you know.\\n\\n\r\nThough this is a moe slice of life anime, typically it'll be all fluff and comedy, but throughout the anime with it's characters, they do go through some form of trials and tribulations as being a mangaka, such as Kaos trying to get her storyboard approved, Koyume needing to experience romance for herself for her romance manga, Ruki and her self-esteem towards her fans and Tsubasa and her family issues. yeah it's light stuff but nonetheless helps the cast grow and see WHY they draw manga in the first place and heck due to the four helping each other with their problems, their friendship and their character chemistry grow and easily makes the experience of watching the anime more enjoyable as you get invested (sure it's small potatoes but nonetheless it has an effect).\\n\\n\r\nThe animation done by Nexus...is REALLY REALLY REALLY MOE, no joke, with it's vibrant and strikingly bloom towards nearly everything, makes the animation really pop. With such moe characters, of course the character designs are really moe yet detailed as well (everything from their irises and the strain of hair are emphasized at times), though this also being a comedy, Comic Girls also goes full chibi during it's more comedic moments for emphasis as well and LA doesn't mind that one bit as it completely helps with it's atmosphere of a slice of life comedy.\\n\\n\r\nAs for voice acting, LA thought LA would get tried of Hikaru Akae's squeaky cadence, yet actually no, it was the right balance of non-squeak and oddly charming especially her \"Ababababa\". Rie Takahashi voicing an eccentric sometimes chunni character...did Megumin turn into a mangaka!?!?. No but seriously, Rie Takahashi did great as Tsubasa and did one of her more niche type roles as well. Saori Oonishi was great as the foil and straight man scthick for the more comedic moments as Ruki. Kaede Hondo was pretty much typecasted as the genki character but nonetheless did well. The rest of the minor cast were great, from Aya Endou as Ririka and Minami Tsuda as Mayu but LA definitely enjoyed Reina Ueda's \"creepy moe\" cadence. If LA did have a favorite voice actor....then it'll be a tie between Rie Takahashi and Saori Oonishi.\\n\\n\r\nComic Girls is no Bakuman, but Comic Girls is to say the least the laxxed and less competitive look at becoming a mangaka. LA knows this will come off cheesy but Comic Girls is if anything but the bonds you make and how they can help you achieve your dream and is manifested easily with the core cast and their love of manga. Comic Girls was a moe and comedic ride in looking at the day to day life of mangaka with a great yet minimal core cast at it's back as you journey with their trials and tribulations along with them.\\n\\n\r\nAbabababa...",

            "content": "Let\u2019s keep this one brief shall we, at least by my standards. Brevity is the soul of of wit, as old Shakey said. Comic Girls manages to carve an identity for itself within the oversaturated market of \u2018CGDCT\u2019 shows by being a very genuine portrayal of what it means to be a struggling creative up and coming in a brutal and unforgiving industry, which will definitely be relatable to many people, myself included. With a unique artstyle and design sense, Comic Girls sets itself apart from the pack by giving weight to it\u2019s characters and environments. Like such past shows as K-on, the locales andbackgrounds of Comic Girls feel like real lived in environs, which only furthers to enhance the atmosphere. The animation is impressive for what it is too, providing excellent comedic timing and some great creative gimmicks like the use of comic panel like cutaways to enhance gags and emotional moments. \\n\\n\r\nA lot of shows like this would push the technical and practical elements of its conceit to the background to focus on cute antics, but Comic Girls faces it head on, deadlines are always looming, improving and getting inspiration is always in the back of the characters\u2019 minds. Even when allowed to relax, the characters\u2019 creatives sensibilities are still at play, because they have to be, and this lead to some of the show\u2019s best moments and gags. At it\u2019s heart, this is a show about drawing manga, and doesn\u2019t let you forget it, while still being able to have funny and cute hijinks along the way.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are definitely not original in concept, but are set apart from the usual cast of this type show by being more down to Earth, understandable people. Kaos is a delicate, self conscious, anxious wreck and I love it because the show is not afraid to show her as kind of pathetic and relatable as opposed to just presenting these traits as adorable quirks, which was refreshing. Tsubasa is a tomboy with trouble connecting emotionally but has her moments of weakness, struggles with upholding the lifestyle that she\u2019s chosen, and has issues with reconciling her current self with how she was raised. Koyume, while seeming like the most simple character, has her own struggles with keeping up and her own self image. All of the residents of the dorm seem like people with real problems despite being professionals, or at least as accurately as you can represent this in a primarily comedic series. The plot progresses as you would expect, with mainly episodic stories of various issues that the girls face in lives as manga artists, with them learning things about themselves in a way that\u2019s not too in your face as to be irritating. \\n\\n\r\nI have to mention the voice acting purely because it\u2019s some of the best i\u2019ve heard in the last few years, with plenty of hilarious nuance in the jokes and in giving each character a unique voice not just in the literal sense, but in the more personal sense, which goes a long way in a character focused series. Music is nice but not worth much discussion, and overall sound design is pretty standard. The show ended in a place that left things fairly open, while still finding a satisfying conclusion enough to leave me in good-ish spirits. Overall an entertaining series and proof that there still is potential left in creating quality shows in this genre. \\n",

            "content": "This series shouldn't work because it's stupid inside and outside, a heir apparent to the abysmal Slow Start from last season. Yet, it does work somehow. There were 3 stellar episodes, 2-3 idiotic ones and 3-4 passables, not a bad ratio considering the sorry state of contemporary anime. Pinkhead protagonist is extremely annoying but the character interactions are interesting and often funny and occasionally scary, despite the overuse of stereotypes. We just look forward to new episodes of Comic Girls every week and can't explain why, the Jappari Park of 2018?\r\nWith a bit more thought given to the script, though that's a contradiction for thiskind of near-zero IQ series, C.G. could have become a truly memorable franchise, especially if the animation budget also got a boost so as not to use blurred photos here and there. Anyhow, C. G., supported by good OP and ED, is still worthy of an \"idle-minded\" colourful and loud marathon watch for the summer.",

            "content": "Spoilers:\t\t        None\r\nRecommendation:\tVery Good\r\nComic Girls is a better show than I thought it would be. In fact, it is one of the better examples of the CGDCT genre I've seen. That it is not the absolute best CGDCT show around is due to the existence of genuinely excellent shows like K-On!, but any fans of the genre should make a point to watch Comic Girls. They will not be disappointed.\r\nThe cute things our cute girls are doing in this case all revolve around manga. All four main characters are young manga artists living and drawing in a dorm together.I'll get to the girls in a second, but it is worth pausing here a moment to make a point. One of the things that sets Comic Girls apart is that it takes this subject matter, the difficulties faced by young aspiring manga artists, seriously. Yes, it gets drowned out most of the time by the moe and the jokes and the incessant emotional outbursts. But it is there, and that is to the show's credit. Sometimes the main character is crying because some comedic trick has been played on her. But just as often it is because she is dealing with imposter syndrome from living with her talented and more accomplished friends, or because she has worked herself to exhaustion on her most recent storyboard, or because that storyboard was subsequently rejected out of hand. This lends Comic Girls a depth that CGDCT shows often lack.\\n\\n\r\nThe girls. As in nearly all CGDCT shows, they are all cute and all fit some identifiable archetype.  Here those archetypes correspond to types of manga. One girl is an extremely feminine social butterfly. She draws shojo. Another is an athletic tomboy who is always ready with advice, a plan of action, and a helping hand. She draws shonen. You get the idea. The girls do a good job embodying their respective types of manga, even down to their flaws. The shonen artist can be overzealous and overly macho. The shojo artist is a bit self-indulgent. The horror artist can't stop trying to scare everyone. \\n\\n\r\nI personally found myself most fond of the tomboy. Maybe one's favorite Comic Girls character serves as a rudimentary Rorschach test of sorts? Shonen is probably my favorite type of manga, after all. I suspect, however, that this idea will be resisted by those whose favorite Comic Girls character is the young girl who draws hentai. \\n\\n\r\nThe overarching plot of the series is the main character Kaos's attempt to break through and get her first story published. This is standard stuff, but done well. The main plot is typically in the background anyway. CGDCT thrives in the everyday incident, and so that is where most episodes of Comic Girls smartly focus. A trip to the art store, a looming deadline, and falling asleep in school after meeting that deadline all furnish enough plot to sustain entire episodes. Those episodes are uniformly good, packed to the brim with cuteness and jokes and the occasional bit of emotional depth. When all these features come together, as they sometimes do, Comic Girls is capable of surprising you with how good it is. It surprised me, at any rate, when a visit to the shonen artist's home provided laughs, a cute new design for the character, and a great deal of depth regarding the inspiration behind her work.  \\n\\n\r\nFor fans of the CGDCT genre, this show is an absolute must-watch. But this is a show that even those less fond of the genre might want to give a look. Yes everyone and everything is cute and unfailingly nice. And I will confess that the screaming and crying of Kaos wore on me quite a bit at times. But still, this is a show that has a lot going for it. \\n",

            "content": "When I first heard about Comic Girls, I was excited because I thought it'd be nice to have an anime about manga artists. It's something that's not very common and it let's you see what it's like for manga artists.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nComic Girls is a slice of life anime, so it doesn't really have a proper story. However, I'm giving the story an 8/10 because it's a unique anime. It's basically an anime about a group of manga artists who live in a house and their day to day lives. It shows them develop and the kinds of manga they write. This has been done beforebut it's rare. It's very nice to have a good anime that's not only cute and funny, but also shows what it's like for manga artists (particularly new ones) and how they write manga.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThe animation was very nice and pleasant to look at. It's not absolutely amazing  but it's pretty good and what I expect to see in a 2018 anime. The characters were very cute too, particularly Kaos-chan.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nThe opening song of the anime was pretty good, although the ending song, while not bad, was forgettable. The background music was nice too.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\r\nThe characters were all funny, very cute and I could even relate a bit with Kaos-chan and Fuura. I was nice to also see a lot of character development too, particularly with Kaos-chan.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nThis anime is another cute, moe, slice of life anime with cute girls doing cute things, but that doesn't mean it's bad. I still found it to be good and i enjoyed watching it. The characters were cute, funny and relatable and it was interesting seeing an anime about manga artists.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nI give this anime a 7/10 rating. While it is another cute girls doing cute things and slice of life anime, it was still fun and nice to watch. The characters were cute and relatable and the story was interesting. It has several funny moments too. If you're looking for an anime about manga artists then I definitely recommend this anime. If you're not bothered and you just want to relax and watch a nice slice of life anime, then I think you should go for it, although if you're new to this genre then I strongly recommend the anime 'New Game'.",

            "content": "It's that time of the season again when the seasonal animes are all ending. It's review time where we get to rate anime based on how good we felt the anime is. And I'm really happy to be reviewing probably one of if not the funniest anime this season, Comic Girls! It's the anime that made me LoL every Friday when I watched it, and the anime whose comedy cures depression after you've watched a depressing episode of another anime. \r\nStory: Pretty straightforward. It's about the MC Kaos-chan wanting to be a Manga artist but always fails her manuscript. However, with the help and supportof her friends, she finally manages to succeed and get her Manga featured! Of course, who can forget the Koyume X Tsubasa moments those are very cute and adorable xD. The story as a whole, is lacking story development. It just skims through very briefly on the important parts which is annoying, but come on, this anime isn't really about the story, it's about the comedic value. And w/o a doubt, the comedic value of this anime is 10/10\\n\r\nRating: 8.2/10\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: The art is pretty decent, I mean you add Manga art to the anime it's ok. \\n\r\nRating: 8.3/10\\n\\n\r\nSound/Music: Nothing much to say. It's on a whole decent\\n\r\nRating: 8.3/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Now for the best scoring category: characters. Surprisingly for a 12 episode anime, the character development is quite detailed. The anime actually makes the effort to develop all of the main characters personality and character. Of course, my favorite character is Kaos-chan, cuz she's so freaking cute!!! From the always happy-go-lucky Koyume, to the caring but serious Ruki to the manga serious Tsubasa, the characters are perfect! \\n\r\nRating: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, funniest Spring anime 10/10. I just watch this for the comedy nothing else. Especially when I need some cheering up after a sad episode of Toji no Miko.\\n\\n\r\nFinal rating: 8.6/10",

            "content": "This review will contain spoilers about the show \"Comic Girls\". So, if you don't want to be spoiled, please watch the anime before proceeding to read further.\r\n\"Comic Girls\" - a show about cute girls doing cute things. Oh, and also drawing manga. Surprisingly, I thought it would be one of those generic cutesy anime that have been flooding the industry as of late but it turned out to be pretty funny and likeable. With that being said, there are certain elements that stood out as being rather weak, which leads me to give this anime a lower score than I want. \r\nStory - 6\r\nA highschool girl joins a mangaka-only dormitory in order to develop further and grow into a fine mangaka. Easier said than done, as this particular high school girl is rather bad at manga, receiving the worst possible reviews and having zero fans. To add salt to injury, her manga skill isn't the only thing that's underdeveloped. Still, she is determined to make it and with the help of her very colorful party of fellow dorm companions, her journey into the world of manga has just begun.\\n\r\nSounds good, right? It would have been even better, had there actually been any significant development/improvement in her skills. Or her character. Or anything for that matter. While the story does include her to a certain degree, it's pretty episodic and I felt that more attention was paid to the issues with the other tenants. In the final episode, she miraculously manages to, seemingly over a short period of time, draw a coherent manga - something she hasn't been able to do in years. Only to fall back down the path of rejected manuscripts during the outro. \\n\r\nIn short, the story starts somewhere and goes nowhere. It was nothing more than a sweet experience of a year in a manga dorm. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 8 \\n\\n\r\nThe art was pretty solid. I think anyone, who's in it for the visuals, will be left satisfied. It is very colorful, very pleasant to watch and it really brings out the characters to life. The choice of color for all the characters - from the cool-looking tomboyish Tsubasa with her dominant blue, to Ruki, with her purple image of a grown-up and mature woman, to Koyume, with her radiant yellow/orange signifying her playful and energetic persona, and Kaos with her pink childish style. I'd say the art nailed the tone of the anime pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7\\n\\n\r\nLet's face it - the soundtrack in most of these cute anime is something not many people would listen to outside the actual anime itself. Still, it's pretty chill and relaxing. It sets the mood quite nicely and works well with the overall tone of the anime. Nothing mind-blowing but nothing bad either.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 6\\n\\n\r\nAnother low score. But hear me out.\\n\r\nAll the characters go through some sort of development. Tsubasa was portrayed as this cool-looking tomboyish girl but she was also shown to have a girly and cute side to her, and also went through a bit of development. Koyume, who was, at first, the filler character for me, quickly got her spot in the show and had a pretty nice episode dedicated to her. Fuura-senpai, the creepy stalker girl also had a bit of spotlight, although only briefly. But, most of all, Ruki was, for me, the character with the most development. Going out from being extremely embarrassed about her *cough* work, to actually taking pride in it due to the support from her fans. It was truly beautiful. \\n\r\nDid I miss someone? I think I mentioned everyone. I' sure I did...\\n\r\nOh, Kaos-chan. Relegated to a side-character for the most of the anime. Truly a pitiful soul. I mean it - the amount of dirt thrown at her throughout the anime made my heart break. It was too much - such a pitiful creature cannot exist (if you don't believe me, just read her 2nd career choice). For me, this was overkill. Extreme overkill. This anime did NOT need to spit so much on poor Kaos-chan. In my mind, this was the worst part of this anime - the over-demoralization of this otherwise extremely pure and kind girl. I barely managed to sit through a few hours of her being shat on (pardon my french) by pretty much life itself, let alone actually being in her shoes. It was.. so sad. Couple that with her lack of development through the majority of the anime and you get the picture.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9 \\n\\n\r\nStill, I enjoyed this anime. Damn, did I enjoy it. It was pretty funny, pretty cute, sad at times, scary at times (Fuura-senpai). It was all. And it could have been even more. If only... IF ONLY!\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7\\n\\n\r\nSadly, the average from the above prohibits me from giving it a higher score. Please forgive me!\\n\\n\r\nFinal words: Do give this anime a shot. It won't win the \"Anime of the Year\" award, nor will it blow your mind. It won't make you cry tears or laughter, nor tears of sadness. It won't leave you full, nor empty inside. But what it will do is give you a couple of hours well-spent, which you won't regret - something that a lot of anime fail at.",

            "content": "Allow me to start with this show is just good. It's a slice of life comedy that explores cute manga girls doing cute manga girl things. It's cute, it's filler, and it doesn't push the envelope. This is not a negative. Some might even call it a positive.\r\nStory:\r\nComic Girls does nothing special with its story. It's a basic plot of girl moves to big city to pursue her dream, meets like minded people, improves skills, etc. There's no grand plot twist that the main character is a murderer, no time travel shenanigans, nothing that would make for the viewer to pause and go \"wait, wut?\"\r\nIt'sa good plot, and sets up conflict on an episode by episode basis, but it isn't innovative. It's not a movie and shaker. It's been done before. I can't recommend it for the story.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe art is beautiful. Plenty of vibrant and bright colors, good character design, and a surprising amount of detail. Personal high lights are Tsubasa's Cosplay outfits as she changes from high school girl to \"Hero\" and completely changes the level of animation.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, a point I'd like to mark in his anime's favor is character outfits. It would've been easy to make the girls stay in cute outfits all the time, but they sometimes go lounging around in outfits I'd probably wear: sweatshirts and sweatpants, long sleeve shirts and pants, jackets and shorts. It's stuff I can actually see human beings wear while lounging around the house and that just put a smile on my face.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThere's nothing amazing about the OP and the ED. They suffice and do well enough. The voice acting, however, is on point. I confess, I'm not familiar with the VA's, but they did an amazing job bringing every character to life. The only one I had a problem with was Kaos, as her screaming, crying, etc. was grating at times, but Tsubasa's mannerisms and the voice behind it more than made up for it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nFinally, time to dig in to the meet of the show.\\n\\n\r\nTsubasa is a tomboy who writes Shonen Manga. She cosplays as her characters while writing to get into the mood, she nerds out over manga, and she's a genuinely good person. She treats her skills as a product of hard work, and doesn't put anyone down for their lack of it. She's always willing to help anyone who needs it, whether it be with drawing, exercise, or, in one instance, a place to stay for a week.\\n\\n\r\nFuura is a later character, and writes Horror. She surrounds herself with the most horrifying images she can, even going so far as to sleep in the haunted attic. Whenever she shows up, it's prefaced by seeing her in a reflection or some other way to creep a character out. She is, by far, the biggest teacher in the group, being the most knowledgeable and best able to teach others how to draw manga.\\n\\n\r\nRukki is Tsubasa's roommate and draws porn. She's shamefaced over her manga, but she puts in genuine romance alongside the actual important bits. A skilled writer who just wants to find love, she is far less professional than Tsubasa in everyday encounters, but is far, far classier when meeting with fans.\\n\\n\r\nKaos is the main character, a pink haired girl with confidence issues and an inability to draw decent manga. She's got a heart of gold, an enthusiasm that just don't quit, and even went so far as to attempt drawing porn. Needless to say, she's a joy to watch, when she's not crying or apologizing.\\n\\n\r\nThe Supporting cast is decently sized, but we don't see much of them. The matron plays a very minor role in every episode, but the one episode that focused on her dealt more with other side characters. To put it simply, you won't have a fun large cast this time around.\\n\\n\r\nIn case you couldn't tell, this was ordered in order of best to worst characters, and there's one character worse than even the supporting cast. Koyume is the worst character in the show, but that's not to say she's bad. She's simply one dimensional in almost every episode. She likes sweets and is a stereotypical high school girl from any anime you've watched, albeit that part's lampshaded. It's just... I don't like her. She's not explored deeply, she doesn't change, except maybe being lesbian.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I wouldn't mind some yuri, but she goes about it in a bad way. Makes me feel bad and a touch creeped out.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed it immensely. It's one of the anime's I'll be recommending for this season.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nA great cast of characters, beautiful animation, and comedy that leaves you entertained if not laughing. A great anime, and a must see for the season.",

In part it was due it falling within a laidback anime style of which I am quite the fan, but the anime in itself should not be discredited as average within that genre. It excelled on what it did, which was making us have some laughs and root for Kaos-sensei on her quest to start her mangaka career. The writing is nothing to marvel at, but it did the job more than well enough. This is a Sliceof Life anime afterall.\\n\\n\r\nAs I think enjoyement is the only score that should ever matter, I give this anime an 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nFirst review ever, might do more of these in the future.",

Bright colours, and the anime as a whole kept it to be a very happy anime.\r\nSound: 7/10\r\nDidn\u2019t really pay too much attention to the music and sound of this anime but the sound was good. Notgreat nor very good just good. The OP was also good. Not much to talk about here.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\r\nKaoruko Moeta, AKA Kaos-sensei, mentioned by other characters in the story is basically a failure, but strives to improve on her manga; \u201cComic Girls\u201d. Koizuka Koyume is a normal typical \u2018perfect\u2019 character of the story. Then there\u2019s Katsuki Tsubasa, who is just basically a Chuunibyou (a character who behaves as if they are a character from a fictional story) and lastly there\u2019s Irokawa Ruki the \u2018I want bigger oppai\u2019 character who draws hentai manga.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nI was actually enjoying this quite a lot unexpectedly but this anime has made a complete 180 to what I expected it to be so props to Nexus for producing this fabulous anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nIt had some minor flaws but it turned out to be a Very Good anime as the title was what I had expected it to be like but it didn\u2019t so I\u2019m glad about that.\\n\\n\r\nIf anyone is looking for an anime that looks for a lil\u2019 comedy and four high school students work their butts off drawing manga and having fun along the way? Then this is an anime you will enjoy.",

I'll be honest, I'm not the biggest fan of \"moe\" anime of any sort, but I have watched some that I thought were not bad, like lucky star (pretty damned outdated I know), and minami ke, not the best examples, and I don't think they're the best either, but for the genre, I think they did pretty well. \r\nThis anime makes you cringe every line the characters act. They are so archetypal and predictable it's laughable. You got the\"shy\" girl protag, \"cool\" shounen artist, and the outgoing best friend girl. I actually definitely find the purple haired girl to actually perhaps have some moments.\\n\r\nI'm not going to write that much, but just know that the plot is bland, characters are boring and cringy, and there isn't much redeeming about it. Just another mediocre \"moe\" anime. I would suggest watching something else",

            "content": "Story: The story is about a bunch of young manga artists living together and bettering their careers. It showed the struggles of being a manga artist at times and the success as well. I liked how they brought a fan aspect into the story with Sensei being a big fan of Tsubasa's. \r\nArt and Animation: Being an anime about making Manga I expected everything to be fantastic. And sure enough the Art and Animation was wonderful. I liked Nexus when they did Calvary and Wakaba Girl so I wasn't worried about how the animation would turn out overall.\r\nSound and Voice Acting: I wasn't a fanof the opening or ending. However I felt like the voice acting was really well done. I love Rie Takahashi and I usually hear her as Megumin in most of her roles but she played Tsubasa really well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: This cast of characters blended really well. Kaos was a surprise to me because while I hated her nervous spats and her calling herself trash constantly she made me laugh the most throughout this anime. Tsubasa though was right up there and she remained my favorite throughout.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I really enjoyed this anime. It was a lot of fun and it was very relatable at time. Just young people trying to work hard at their profession and overcoming specific obstacles.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I would have hoped Comic Girls wouldn't have been a cute girls doing cute things anime, but it slightly was that in the end. There was a lot of progression throughout the anime but it was more of these girls going out and gaining experience and ideas to help them with their works. It still has a lot of cute moments and the characters are awesome. I would recommend Comic Girls if you're looking for a cute show that sort of breaks the moild.",
