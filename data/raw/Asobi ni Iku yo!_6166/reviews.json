            "content": "Unyaaa!!\r\nFor those that don't know what that means, it's apparently cute cat talk and reference to 2010's summer anime Asobi ni Iku Yo. An anime purely dedicated to fan-service enthusiasts who love eye-candy.\r\nWith an abundance of clich\u00e9 anime that provide service in the market, it's pretty hard for people to differentiate whether it's worth watching or passing up(due to having seen its type before.) Whilst I'd normally say the latter for Asobi, I'd be lying if I did as it had definitely caught my attention within the first 2 or so episodes. Asobi is an anime that amalgamates everything a fanboy loves and adds astory for which the most part, does leave you wanting to see what happens next. If only it had kept it's pacing and consistencies to the very end, I might have had better regards for its rating.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 6\\n\r\nAsobi ni Iku Yo is a tale of how an ordinary boy meets an extraordinary alien cat-girl(nekomimi shoujo). Clich\u00e9d? Definitely. So what makes Asobi any better then the rest of what's out there? Simple. Add in a gun wielding childhood friend, an introvert spectacle-wearing classmate with special powers, a teacher belonging to an underground UFO cult, an uncle who seems to be more then he is, a cat worshiping ojou-sama, and an alien dog-woman as the main antagonist and we have a formulated cast that could either make or break the show...\\n\\n\r\n The disadvantage to this though, is the introduction of too many characters that you could easily like, and not leaving much in regards to background.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 6\\n\r\nAs an anime dedicated to fan-service, it was in no doubt that ecchi would play a part in the series. As a hot-blooded male I see nothing wrong with that and considering its targeted audience are probably lonely boys who get off on the harem setting, the series has done well in the visual department as it didn't cater for just one fan of ecchi either. Whilst most guys will agree that bigger breast is best, we cannot out rule that there are a certain few who's preference are palm-sized or have none at all. Asobi provides this.\\n\\n\r\nWatching the series in an upscaled HD format, artwork was passable as it's not mediocre yet I wouldn't class it as a masterpiece either. Everything is drawn well and animation is fluid throughout the series, which I believe should be a standard norm for any anime being produced as of 2010. Hence my rating of 6.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 6\\n\r\nLike its art, OP and ED are not groundbreaking, and at best suits its uplifting theme throughout the series. With Sphere playing their catchy J-pop tune \"Now loading... SKY!!\" on opening credits, one could feel that this is your average type harem or romance/comedy as it's a beat that unconsciously invites fandom into the series. One thing worth mentioning though is the series choice of seiyuu(voice actor). As a fan of Haruka Tomatsu(Rouge from Basquash, the twins from Nyan Koi! and Aoba of Cross Game just to name a few), they have decided to use her talents as the mains childhood friend in a tsundere type role. Now this may be another chance for the director to show more service and if it was, then it's pure win as Haruka is the type of seiyuu I prefer playing a tsundere-type lead over others in the market(eg. Rie Kugimiya).\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 6\\n\r\nWhilst each character on their own may seem clich\u00e9 and lackluster, it's the culmination of having them brought together that I guess makes this anime work. As clich\u00e9s go, we have your main Kio who is the center of the story. An uninspiring lead who nose-bleeds easily, but I really can't fault him as he does fall in your classic harem archetype of being the weak/shy boy who will stand up to anything regardless of fortitude. If only he wasn't as clueless, I might have liked this anime even more. Then we have his harem, Eris(alien cat-girl), Manami(childhood friend) and Aoi(school friend with mysterious powers). Whilst each heroine falls under their own archetype also, they do have redeeming qualities that can out rule you from rolling your eyes each time they go into clich\u00e9-mode. There are others worth mentioning, but I won't so not to spoil it for you, and my only advice in this area is to take each character introduced lightly as this anime pokes fun and may even parody certain archetypes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment & OverAll - 5\\n\r\nUnfortunately what started out as an anime with a lot of promise, due to the series being short and certain inconsistencies, it had left some questions unanswered and felt rushed at the end giving us a mediocre conclusion. There are a lot of flaws to this series from becoming a \"cut-above-the-rest\" type harem, but for an anime that runs at 12 episodes, I guess it's a lot better then some out there I could list out. Whilst the series may not be aiming for top spot in MAL or any other anime review site, what it does aim for is to give viewers 20+ minutes of mindless entertainment per episode, and give lonely boys out there some false hope that it may happen to them.\\n\\n\r\nIf you don't mind service, then this anime is worth the laughs and amusement. \\n\\n\r\nUNYAAA!!",

            "content": "~!~ WARNING: Spoilers ~!~\r\nJeez...I kinda wish I didn't even watch this anime to begin with. Maybe I'm just being harsh, but there wasn't something great about this. It was such a let-down. Something really promising at first and very quickly dropped as soon as you start.\r\n~ Story 2/10 ~\r\nI might be missing some accuracy because of the story being boring and unappealing so forgive me.\r\nThe main character is Kio Kakazu, an easy-going teen who seems to accept his new reality quite easy as his new friend is an alien cat girl, his childhood friend is a special agent, and his other friend is also aspecial agent as well. Essentially, this kid becomes pulled into a terrible situation by being involved with alien cat girls who came down to earth because...of the fish? While his friends work for the government as professional agents who are armed from head to toe.\\n\r\nThe story is quite ridiculous and almost stupid. It's not even really in a funny way. It ruins itself from this style. Sure, it could have been quirky and an interesting to watch if it didn't fail to live up to what it could have been.\\n\r\nThe very first episode is interesting as you watch an awesome fight scene. You find yourself clapping at the animation, even though it's awkward sometimes, and fight scenes. Something seems odd about it but you feel like this anime will be action packed and detailed.\\n\r\nWatching Asobi ni Iku yo is like having this amazing business man come to your door and offering you on an adventure that could save the universe. However, as soon as you accept his request and go to shake is robust, muscular hand, he turns into a wacky and cartoony clown that says \"Just kidding\" and slaps his genitals in your face before riding off into the sky on his own ass.\\n\r\nAfter this fight scene, you see our \"hero\" teen of the story who meets the first cat girl, Eris. Right after that, everything goes down hill.\\n\r\nReasons for why aliens are present on the earth seems silly to the point that you'll find yourself face palming why they take such huge and crucial parts of the story and dismiss them with simple reasons or childish remarks as if it's nothing. The episodes don't even seem to go anywhere or develop. If you even found ONE silver lining in the story, you will be crushed dearly by the ending.\\n\r\nI tried to take in atleast the romance factor of the anime. It's all like a harem, but maybe the anime will come through with a love complex between the two main characters, right?\\n\r\nNo.\\n\r\nYou will find the solution to the complicated love triangle and who out of the handful of girls that love this guy gets to be with them. The solution at the end? Well, why don't they just all marry him? It's not illegal atleast by cat alien standards.\\n\r\nThere is honestly no story. You could watch this and not even pay attention to the details and it would pretty much be the same thing. The only thing that seems to be story is the girls getting into ridiculous situations involving them to dress slutty or find some way to show off fan service.  If you went into the anime without expecting anything at all, you'll be fine. If you want a cool sci-fi about neko girls and a pleasant romance, you might want to turn around.\\n\r\nand run far away and never come back unless you are really bored.\\n\\n\r\n~ Art 9/10 ~\\n\r\nHonestly the only thing I seemed to enjoy was the art of this anime. The animation is very fluid although awkwardly clunky sometimes. The style they chose is quite lovely. The atmosphere is displayed so well as the scenes change from beaches to seas, mornings to afternoons, neighborhoods to malls, etc...\\n\r\nAll are greatly detailed and vibrant. It's colorful and enjoyable. Characters are nicely designed along with it's beautiful scenes and color. It's as if someone put lots of love and care into this factor, and I almost feel really bad for the artist for the fact that he wasn't complimented by the music, writers, or really anyone. If there was anyone who was truly serious about this product, it was the artist.\\n\\n\r\n~ Sound 7/10 ~\\n\r\nThere isn't much to say about the soundtrack. There really isn't anything special about it. The music isn't bad but it isn't memorable either. It's basic and meets the standards but that's all. However, it was nice from time to time. It was a decent soundtrack that was even very fitting sometimes. Voice actors were also skilled. If their scripts were better, I would've been more impressed by them. Although, it seems they were working with limited material and didn't even seem to take it seriously sometimes.\\n\\n\r\n~ Characters 4/10 ~\\n\r\nCardboard cut-outs and and big boobs. That's it.\\n\r\nThe only thing flat in this show is the characters. But atleast their chests aren't.\\n\r\nThe female characters are basic and stereotypical or sometimes have no personality besides boobs. Other characters are interesting. However, there isn't anyone too special or unique. You'd find that sometimes, the robot characters that don't even talk have more personality than the characters who talk.\\n\r\nIt isn't dreadful as the dialogue isn't atrocious and the personalities do have some shape. Overall, though, it's not much and your characters are mostly there because they are important to the \"story\" or they are just sex appeal.\\n\\n\r\n~ Enjoyment 4/10 ~\\n\r\nThere isn't much to enjoy from this anime. What could be good and have excellent potential seem to be held back. The fight scenes would seem serious and well detailed while intense. At the same time, no one is murdered and you'll find enemies taken down easily by cutesy cliche' magical girl styles.\\n\r\nTons of tanks and helicopters and soldiers arrive and they are disarmed by a girl with a hammer, the vehicles disappearing and the soldiers naked and defenseless. The action is so held back. It seems like they want to be serious but can't be.\\n\r\nOne moment you'll have soldiers, and then have toy robot cat drones firing lasers and destroying matter to enter a boat. Whatever happens in the anime, there isn't an explanation. If it happened, that's all there is to it. Any questions will go unanswered unless it's unimportant. Nothing besides the art draws you in and so many things are a let-down. The romance is poor, the action had potential, the characters are poor, and the story is the biggest disappoint. Not even the ending was enjoyable. It's as if nothing happens through the entire thing even though so many things transpire. Why? WHY?!\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nEverything besides the art was lacking greatly. Nothing drew you in. Nothing satisfied you. If you go in with expectations, you leave disappointed unless you only like fan service. Nothing seems to happen really. You can watch the first few episodes and the last episode and it would almost be the same as watching the entire thing.\\n\r\nThere isn't much to watch besides fan service and art. Maybe you could pull out something from this. If you like something funny and sexy scenes, maybe this anime is for you. Who knows, it might be your tastes. Anything else....well you will surely be disappointed.",

            "content": "Warning this review may contain spoilers.  It's the first review I've ever written for this site; therefore you notice it isn't 'quite' in the site's unofficial format.  Which as far as I can tell is almost a checklist of the top five scores and their final overall.\r\nAsobi ni Iku yo!\r\nSurprisingly; good story.  It's a short story format; only three 'arcs' maybe four.  All interconnected and they all had a point.  They constantly fore-shadowed things that would appear in later episodes.\r\nThe echii/harem side of things...  Was almost sidelined by the gun-fire and explosions.  It's a fairly straight up action/adventure/sci-fishow with quite a few parodies and references.\\n\\n\r\nThe 'bounce' factor was 'almost' down-played.  First three episodes they stared; after that Eris's mighty bust is constantly present but hardly an active focus.\\n\\n\r\nIt''s a very soft 'melo melo' 'pure love' sort of echii; they even make reference to this in the op.  They kissed...  Once.  Occasionally there was an accidental infringement scene; especially in the first half.  They ended up in swim suits twice; in one case pantsu was involved due to a tail hole.\\n\\n\r\nI'm sorry; this was far less echii then I expected from all the descriptions and feed back.  The story wasn't focused on it; it existed but as a back drop for the actual story.  \\n\\n\r\nThe lead...  Is Too Dense To Take Seriously.  He also isn't unlucky enough to be considered a plot trigger.  I can't even remember his name despite it being used dozens on dozens of times.  He could have been anyone in that situation; I firmly believe that his only reason for being in the anime was to be the viewers 'avatar'.  His personality is a blank non-descriptive hole.\\n\\n\r\nFor that very reason I'm grateful; for there are moments, songs, and various scenes which where the anime rose far above the general harem feel.  Tora-dora had more sexual tension...  Seriously.  The echi is existant, it is a small part of; however it is not the entirety of this anime...  Not by a long shot.\\n\\n\r\nBe it the lonely spaceman, the various parodies, music, political reactions, and ect.  There was far more to this show then just echi, oppai, and the harem way.\\n\\n\r\nTo lost adventurers, crazy cults, moon gazing, robot independence, political conspiracy, and parodies without end.  Kampai!\\n\\n\r\nI gave this show an 8.  For excellent action, some particularly stirring pieces of sound/music, a solid story line, average voice actors, so-so echii, and because on occasion...  Rare occasion.  Amidst those short twelve episodes...  I found a scene that could touch my soul.\\n\\n\r\nI expected the occasional grin, a guffaw, to stare in awe of the bounce.  I didn't expect to find serious messages buried amidst the comedy.\\n\\n\r\nYou can't take this show seriously; it's a light watch.  However if you can enjoy the genre; then don't hesitate to watch it just because of a few negative comments.  There are some things in this short little gem that are well worth checking out.\\n\\n\r\nThey are hidden and often to the point; much like any good comedians...  There are dark/terrible truths buried beneath the humor.",

Story is weird but fine because of that juicy uncensored ''plot''.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation\\n\r\nThe animation is very good, the ecchi parts were visually pleasant, it was well made, nothing much to say other than censor-kun doesn't appear in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe VA is good, the music is good, in one episode the first living assistroid goes to the earth and in the end she sings a good song which Chihara Minori performs.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThey are good, Aoi is interesting, Eris is naive but likeable and not annoying as you would imagine naive characters are, Manami is good and Kakazu is not a wuss but also not a pervert but the ones that i liked the most were the assistroids specially Chu Yun Fat.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nI really liked the ecchi this has to offer but the comedy is decent and the characters were good, there's also winks at other animes like Hidan no Aria, Kampfer (which was mediocre) and others, i had a good time watching this.",

            "content": "My score follows the MAL word associated with it; hence the 4 is a 'Bad'. However, everyone's tastes are different and encourage you to read the points below rather than just my rating.\r\n-A few Clich\u00e9s.\r\nNow there is not really anything bad with having clich\u00e9s if you like them. You got your cat girl and a few other characters living with the dense and useless lead. If these are your cups of tea they are implemented pretty well. However, if you are looking for something new there is not a lot to offer.\r\n-This is a harem show, \r\nYou will find yourself rooting for Aoi, like me,or the cat girl Eris. However, the show is biased and behind Aoi most of the time, even the childhood friend Manami is giving her assistance regretfully. While the male lead is thick, the interaction between Aoi and Manami made this show enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\n- and it has a Relative solution to the harem.\\n\r\nI am saying this in partly to not to expect a completely open end; It does well to provide some closure so you don't kick and scream when it is over. However, i am not praising it.\\n\\n\r\n-Lots of fighting.\\n\r\nI am surprised that Action is not one of the tags for this show actually. The first two or so episodes are highly enjoyable and give you high expectations for the rest of the series. While the action dies down over time essentially everyone, except Kio, provides us with a lot of enjoyable gun fights. Don't worry though, the bullets later on only destroy non-organic matter!\\n\\n\r\n-This show suffers from little plot in between the start and end.\\n\r\nThe integration of Eris into the cast, the first arc, is enjoyable and fast paced. However, soon it reverts into a episodic style that slowly grows stale, and the only sanction is the development of Aoi. As if the producers noticed this, they slap in an ending arc which results in our lame Kio saving Earth.\\n\r\n In\\n\\n\r\n-Character development is minimal.\\n\r\nThe only two characters focused on are Manami and Aoi. Both Kio and Eris lay out the road to our story, but there is very little focus on them growing in any way. Without spoiling the end, the two girls provide the bulk of the development as they struggle to understand their emotions.\\n\\n\r\n-Low comedic value.\\n\r\nI am not easily amused. While the assistroids are entertaining to watch, i wouldn't claim to have laughed at all during this show.",

            "content": "Hey I just want to start off by saying that this is only a review based off of my own opinion and personal experience watching the show. So for anyone who's seen the show and may be offended or otherwise, I apologize in advance. Cat Planet Cuties, as it is dubbed by Funimation, revolves around a young high schooler named Kio Kakuza, who one day meets a young, beautiful, busty girl with cat ears and a tail, named Eris, claiming to be an alien. Apparently her and other members of her race, came to Earth in order to set up friendly relations with humans. Notsoon after though, Kio and Eris are constantly being pursued by multiple factions with different plans in mind. \\n\\n\r\nStory 4/10: The story was fairly decent at best, but not all that interesting. Now I'm open to all types of different genres, in fact ecchi/harem's are among my favorites, which is what this show classifies as. However I think as a Sci-fi this would be more enjoyable with more action. It's pretty much just a bunch of fan service although I rather enjoy fan service. \\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10: I normally don't have any complaints about the artwork in a show and I'm not going to start now. The art isn't anything unique or new, but it's not horrible either.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10: I thought the soundtrack was pretty good and nothing to really complain about.  I especially found the opening theme rather enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 6/10: The character development is fair at best, nothing all that special. You got your typical girl from another world who for no real reason falls in love with the main protagonist and is normally as ditzy as she is big-boobed. Then you got the child-hood friend who's hot and totally in love with the main character, but just can't admit it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it's an okay anime and it might be worth your time, but hey. \\n\\n\r\nAnyways this is my review and I hoped you enjoyed it. Thanks.",

This partnership will not only enhance the prosperity and trust between us, but, also, to affirm our Goddess and Savior is the one and only Eris. We swear to assist and provide  protection against enemies that endanger the safety and well-being of our Goddess and her fellow Catians. In return, we only ask that the Goddess, herself, graces us with her presences from time to time.\r\nSIX ORDINANCES\r\nIn an effort to build a stronger relationship with our fellow Catians, we have observed 12videos that detail our Goddess\u2019 life and her daily encounters with Earth\u2019s surroundings. We have, therefore, written six ordinances that follow our Goddess\u2019 behavior. All current and future members should follow these ordinances:\\n\\n\r\n1) Thou Shalt Worship Cat Ears and Cat Tails\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2013 Cat ears and cat tail have been adored by hundreds of people around the world. They evoke emotions of cuteness, of softness, and of fluffiness. We have satisfied our love by wearing fake cat ears and cat tails. That is, until the arrival of our Goddess, Eris; her authentic cat ears and cat tails prove that the real ones are far superior to fakes. We can toss aside our fakes, and worship the real ones. Praise those lovely cat ears and cat tails!\\n\\n\r\n2) Thou Shalt Not Kill\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2013 As stated by Catian law, murder is not permitted. As such, bullets and other devices that dissolve inorganic matter, while preserving organic matter was developed. We approve such a respectable law and have adopted it ourselves. The results were impressive! Our Goddess battled against tanks, but they were easily dissolved by the touch of her hammer, leaving behind no vehicle and only naked men. Our Goddess\u2019 friends used magic bullets on assassins, and on Russian soldiers. The results: nothing left behind, but naked individuals. What our Goddess is telling us is to humiliate our enemies by stripping them nude.\\n\\n\r\n3) Enemies of Catia Shall Be Our Enemy\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2013 In the beginning, our enemies were members of the Beautiful Contact led by Maki Itokazu, Aoi from the Immigration Bureau of Japan, and Manami Kinjou from the CIA recruitment program. Their target was to eliminate our Goddess, Eris. However, one person stood by her, his name was Kio Kakazu. This young boy stopped the attacks and managed to recruit and convince Aoi, Manami Kinjou, and Maki Itokazu into saving Eris from a military compound. Then, afterwards, our brilliant Goddess sent a message to her mothership, telling them that the grilled beef was excellent, which prompted them to appear overhead. They signed a treaty with the Japanese Government and, thus, are not considered an enemy. This prevented future attacks from the Beautiful Contact, Immigration Bureau of Japan, and the CIA. Then, a new enemy appeared called Dogisia. They attacked a ship with our Goddess and her friends on board, hoping to sink the ship and take our Goddess with it. They attacked a camp site where our Goddess and her friends were eating. They raided the Catian Embassy (i.e. Kio\u2019s house). And they attacked a Catian ship, which had other catians. In the end, they were annihilated in space. We assisted our Goddess and her friends by providing money, weapons, and fighting maids. Fuck with us! And our maids will kill you!\\n\\n\r\n4) Thou Shalt Wear Skimpy Clothing or None At All\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2013 It would seem our Goddess loves to walk around in bare clothing, wearing, sometimes, only underwear and a long shirt. Most times, she wears her alien cat suit and swimsuit to flaunt her large breast, a very proud thing to display. Her friends, on the other hand, go to more extreme lengths. Members of Catian mothership, wore nothing, but typical Japanese swimsuits to a negotiation, it was very effective. Aoi and Manami sometimes fight in ridiculous clothing, such as a Gundam suit and a playboy suit. They, also, fought with no clothing at all. Based on our Goddess\u2019 and her friends\u2019 behavior, it would seem wearing skimpy clothing is appropriate for any situation, as everyone around them seem completely oblivious to it.\\n\\n\r\n5) Thou Shalt Forgo Traits That Develop One\u2019s Character\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2013 Our Goddess has encountered many people on Earth, and they all share one similarity. They all lack some character traits or backstory. The members of Catian mothership, what is their backstory, why do they want to fly this specific ship and their reasons for exploring the galaxy? Well, to us, members of Underside of Kitten Paw, we have no need to understand this information. Kio Kakazu seems to be a good-natured person, who is kind, caring, and really dense when it comes to love. Aoi is your typical shy girl whose crush just so happens to be near her target person. Manami Kinjou is a gun frantic with a tomboy attitude and personality, who is always complaining. Maki Itokazu is a teacher, the leader of the Beautiful Contact and that\u2019s it, from thereon, she complains that our Goddess, Eris, is not a real alien. The villain, Janes, has a motive for her actions, but her personality is one-dimensional, it never changes. We, as members of this organization, should strive to not have any traits that develop one\u2019s character.\\n\\n\r\n6) Thou Shalt Respect the Catian Customs and Laws\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2013 There were several Catian Laws that we would like to acknowledge: (1) Polyamory \u2013 when a man can have more than one lover, this practice was the solution to Kio\u2019s problem when he was loved by Aoi, Manami, and Eris, our Goddess. This directly resulted in a harem ending. (2) On the 16th birthday, our Goddess went into heat and was having sexual desires, unfortunately, it hindered her fighting abilities and, thus, she had to take a pill to end her mating period. (3) All Catians must own an assist-a-roid, this machine can pretty do anything, except talk, they have no mouths and no emotionally responses.\\n\\n\r\nBy following these six ordinances, we hope that our relationship with Catians rises. We hope that one day, we may obtain a power to grow cat ears and cat tails. We hope that our Goddess continues to grace us with her presences.\\n\\n\r\nAll Hail Our Goddess!\\n\\n\r\nAll Hail Eris!\\n\\n\r\nAll Hail Eris!",

Asobi ni Iku yo! gradually turned into some form of harem story where the indecisive omega male gets the ladies. The series is a love letter  to cat lovers and the technology featured is something to think about. The series is greatly flawed by the holes in its plot. Overall, Asobi ni Iku yo provides light-hearted entertainment that's neither spectacular nor absolutely horrible.",

            "content": "Ok, first of all, this is my first time writing a review, but I felt like I need to after reading the biased, argumentative feelings this anime brought to the table. \r\nI am going to start out with the negatives, just because they are the first things I noticed within the anime, but if you read on, I guarantee positives will come from it. \r\n1) The story had literally no character development whatsoever, everyone just happened to either be part of the CIA, a terrorist organization, or the immigration bureau. and all be centered around this one guy who happens to be who the ecchialien takes a liking to. The story itself is plot-hole city, and the ending is disappointing as hell, with so much unexplained, but I still recommend watching it for yourself.\\n\\n\r\n2) This show literally refused not be be the cliche of the age-old cats vs. dogs scenario, and when I first saw it, I was like, 'This is just stupid.' And it was. Extremely. \\n\\n\r\n3) This story is fan service central, with all the main characters being in positions where they are at least half-naked at least once per episode, and it just got to the point where it was a bit ridiculous. But, being the pervert that I am, I found myself questioning it because 'Why draw so much hentai if you are just going to blur it out? Make a censored and uncensored version, or just pull off a Love Hina (If you know what I mean) and just use the characters hair or the surroundings to hide it, instead of just white clouds of piss-off. \\n\\n\r\n4) The story itself ended somewhat half-heartedly, with an easy to create OVA that could have followed it. Personally, I think they ran out of money in the budget.\\n\\n\r\nOk, now after going through that, let's explain the fun parts of this show.\\n\\n\r\n1) Personally, I loved  the ending, which I can't get into right now, but just know that it was satisfying enough that everyone wins. Its like the show couldn't decide where its fan-base put its faith, but I think they made the right decision. Its what every (at least male) fan wants to see. But like I said in my disappointments, it ended half-heartedly.\\n\\n\r\n2) All the aliens were female, and that is kind of the reason I wanted to watch this anime. It added flavor to my list of anime angels, cosplayers, pokemon, and incest. Sadly, each and every one of those is true.\\n\\n\r\n3) There was lots of action that actually fit the story, and it kind of off-balanced the whole \"stupid\" part of it, and it is something that kept the story going.\\n\\n\r\n4) Lastly, I thought the art of this was beautiful, it was so tropical and colorful, yet fit each and every surrounding that the characters decided to settle down in. I gave art a 9, character and sound an 8, enjoyment a 7 and story a 6. My Overall was 7. I hope you guys found this review helpful!",

            "content": "Nyaa!!!!  Alien kitty goodness.  I just have to say that if an alien who had the form of a hot girl with kitty ears and a tail, I would question if she was real, or just cos-playing.  Wouldn't you?  If memory serves me right everyone just accepted her and was like \"hey we are having a party want to join us?\"   WHAT?!  The main humor is that since she is an alien she doesn't know what is considered normal on earth.  So one of the first books that she reads is a book that was found underKio's bed.  I am just going to let you think about that.\\n\\n\r\nI like how they emphasize the realness of the cat ears and tails.  How they move and twitch.  I thought that it was a nice little touch.  Little details like that are honestly are what make certain anime better than others.  You can't just throw a bunch of big boob girls together and make a good anime...... Well maybe you can, but that is besides the point. the point that I was trying to make.  The point that I wanted to make is that I have watched a fair amount of anime, and when I see things that I can relate to other anime it puts a smile on my face.  ^_^\\n\\n\r\nOpening theme was too easy going sounding.  It should have been a little more fast pace in my opinion.  I say this because the main idea of this anime is the fight for earth, along with the love story on the side.\\n\\n\r\nOkay I mean really?!  Both Manami and Aoi are secret agents?!  I mean how much more farfetched can you get.  Fine I mean we are already taking about aliens why not go all the way.  I may not have not liked the idea personally at first, but the way that both of the them get incorporated into the story line was very interesting. \\n\\n\r\nOMG I love the robots!  It was so funny because at one point they have numbers drawn on their foreheads since nobody can tell them apart.  They can't talk so they communicate using a sign.  All they have to do is turn the sign and the words on it changes.  It's soo cool.  \\n\r\n...But, not as cool as the gun that makes clothes disappear.  I gave this anime a 7 since I thought that the story line was something new for me and I enjoyed it.  New things are always good.\\n\r\nIt may not be new to you but it was a new experience for me.",

            "content": "Well, at first I didn\u2019t know anything about this. I guessed by the name it may be pretty fan service oriented but when I turned on the first episode, it actually looked like it would be serious. Boy, was I wrong with that idea. It turns into a big harem mess. It\u2019s almost just like Please Teacher mixed with other Harem shows. \r\nIt\u2019s all about food, boobs, and very little bit about the Sci-fi stuff. Let me give you an example of how this show doesn\u2019t take itself too seriously. Eris beats a million tanks with hammers, even taking the clothing of the tank guysinside. And just when I thought the show was about to end, the show got even stranger with the cat girls going to a meeting wearing school girl swimsuits with a magical girl transformation showing naked images. The third show even starts out with a version of the Star Trek opening altered for the cat aliens. \\n\\n\r\nI do have a question, where the heck are all the male cat boys? I with I could see more diverse gender to this instead of all the girls\u2026 and this isn\u2019t just because I\u2019m a girl. I do like a lot of designs for anthro girls but I also like the ideas for the men as well. The only male we do see from cat world is an image of his mouth. We see no tail or ears and even his eyes are hidden from us.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a lot of references to Star Trek and a couple other shows that any Trekie would probably fall in love with it. There is a special episode also that isn\u2019t all that funny. Episode 9 talks more about how that catians and earthlings feel the same about a song that played for a special Sci-fi anime. The song is rather beautiful and gives the feeling of loneliness in space. \\n\\n\r\nKio is just like Kei from Please Teacher. His voice, personality, almost everything feels pretty much like a copy of him except for the stand still-thing. He lets people push him around mostly, and is pretty much a guy that acts older then he is. He even stays with a perverted uncle. The girls feel like they were all pushed onto him and it really is too much like they just pushed every type of supernatural or alien idea into one small little area of Japan. The only character with any real since is Aoi. The reason why I say that is she doesn\u2019t get made right away when Kio ends up with cat girls hanging all over him because of reading a magazine.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is standard. Kio even looks like Kei from Please Teacher and Eris looks much like a sexual version of Horo from Spice and Wolf. Most designs feel like they were stolen from other animes. Its standard all the way threw from the character design to the background.\\n\\n\r\nThe English voices are standard too, and yet seem to fit with the style of the show. It\u2019s pretty much standard all the way threw so nothing special but yet I guess I could say that it would be pretty fun to see how it pans out. I would really see this as a watch show.\\n",

Of course.\r\nArt (7/10) - The animation was most likely the best aspect of this show. It was nice, smooth... and to be honest, it is uncanny how much Eris looks like Holo (Spice and Wolf).\r\nSound (5/10) - Simple, nice songs over visuals that ascent theecchi fan-service of the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (5/10) - You have your average MC in a Harem; coupled with an alien girl, girl-next-door, and a crush girl from school.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (6/10) - Typical ecchi-harem anime. Not something you'd hate, but not something you'd love either. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (5.6/10) - This show wasn't the best. I found it hard to get through it about half-way. There are definitely worse ones than this, but there are SO many better ones. As much as I hear people raving about Neko characters, this is my first time actually seeing one in an anime.",

First off lets talk about my favorite character Eris. Eris is a alien cat girl who was sent to earth to learn more about it when she meets Kio who was kind enough to aid her on her mission.  after the first day on earth we learn that she is always kind, always asking questions, has a childlike innocence, cares deeply about her friends, LOVES food, and she is mostly in heat which ifound funny.  My only complaint is that she is equipped with a power suit and has a hammer that can make tanks vanish, but she only has 3 fighting scenes while the other characters got to fight in all of the episodes, but she is still awesome. Another thing i liked about this show was the art. The art in this was amazing, there were colors everywhere and the amount of detail they put in for even the smallest things like the leave, the sidewalk, and the cars were outstanding. And last but not least the atmosphere. This show always had a happy vibe to it. There were no sad back stories, none of the good guys died, and at the end all three girls decided to share Kio together so everything worked out in the end. This anime had such a good vibe that i watched it over and over again, but I cant seem to find another anime like this, making this a one of a kind masterpiece.  I just wished that they kept it on air so we could have seen how this story progressed.",

            "content": "Ok, so this is more like an extraordinary situation were black ops mixed with ET and added with child's play kinda thing, I like the characters the way that they were drawn and the setting, were it is set on the southern part of Japan, in Okinawa. Eris, the lead female character seem to have the combination of Lala from \"To Love Ru\" and  Horo from \"Spice and Wolf,\" but just like any light novel animes it is still a combination of different genre for each episode which by the way I kinda hate the musical part about a space man in ep9. Thenagain that first assistant droid  could  had a longer role within the series. My main criticism is the authors and illustrators idea of arming the 2 girls Minami and Aoi which basically doesn't have the right body mass to weapon recoil ration e.g. when Aoi pull up a 3.57 Colt Python against her chauffeur/ handler I'm surprise that she can handle a gun that weight about 5lbs and has a recoil of baseball batter when fired for a pettit girl like her to handle, if a girl with the body mass and height like that of Aoi were fire that kind of gun, she would also get hurt in the process because the gun's blow back would literally throw itself back  towards her co'z she's unable to control it. For Minami, she was branded by Kio as gun otaku, if she is then why is ep6 she requested for a M134 Minigun that is not mounted in a tripod only to find out that it's just to heavy for her to lift ? As a gun otaku it is important that you know what gun you can handle and what you can't handle, that doesn't seem to be the case with Minami who only has an average IQ for guns, also, Aoi is seen using a Dragunov Sniper rifle  in ep8, black ops usually shy away from that kind of rifle because of it's limited accuracy most would either use an H&K PSG 1 sniper rifle, A1 Arctic Warfare or Remington Bolt Action Rifle. Also there were instances were the girls handled various 9mm pistols but can still prove to much for a petite girl to handle. However I can give credit for the illustrator for making Aoi use the S&W 38 police special for the rest of the series  it is basically a kind of gun which petite teenagers can handle. I also noticed that in ep7 there is a German WW2 MG42  featured, doesn't  the illustrator know that such weapon is no longer being manufactured and the M249 SAW is the most widely used machine gun amongst armed forces like Japan's SDF? \\n\\n\r\nYou know, I think authors and illustrators should not just focus on any gun for the character, it is important that a certain gun should match the character's physique, age and combat role, if we'll look at the more matured characters in the anime we can seen that the guns they possess matched their physique   like Antonia's maid which is understandable that they also functions as her body guards, in fact, it should be Kio's uncle who should be possessing the 3.57 Colt Python and M134 Minigun in the first place, as for the Dragunov Sniper Rifle it kinda looks good for Maki Itokazu (Kio's teacher) to handle it.  So just like that certain guns should be match like jewelry for certain character.\\n\\n\r\nTrivia: It is Illegal in Japan for a citizen to own a gun, do you know that not all law enforcement officers in Japan carry a gun? In fact only the SDF, SAT and those assign for body guard duty were allowed to carry a firearms. Even thought Japan's police were trained to shoot, their standard issue Nambu cal 37 Revolver were always left in the station under lock and key only to be use for very special emergencies.",

            "content": "Unyaaa!!\r\nFor those that don't know what that means, it's apparently cute cat talk and reference to 2010's summer anime Asobi ni Iku Yo. An anime purely dedicated to fan-service enthusiasts who love eye-candy.\r\nWith an abundance of clich\u00e9 anime that provide service in the market, it's pretty hard for people to differentiate whether it's worth watching or passing up(due to having seen its type before.) Whilst I'd normally say the latter for Asobi, I'd be lying if I did as it had definitely caught my attention within the first 2 or so episodes. Asobi is an anime that amalgamates everything a fanboy loves and adds astory for which the most part, does leave you wanting to see what happens next. If only it had kept it's pacing and consistencies to the very end, I might have had better regards for its rating.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 6\\n\r\nAsobi ni Iku Yo is a tale of how an ordinary boy meets an extraordinary alien cat-girl(nekomimi shoujo). Clich\u00e9d? Definitely. So what makes Asobi any better then the rest of what's out there? Simple. Add in a gun wielding childhood friend, an introvert spectacle-wearing classmate with special powers, a teacher belonging to an underground UFO cult, an uncle who seems to be more then he is, a cat worshiping ojou-sama, and an alien dog-woman as the main antagonist and we have a formulated cast that could either make or break the show...\\n\\n\r\n The disadvantage to this though, is the introduction of too many characters that you could easily like, and not leaving much in regards to background.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 6\\n\r\nAs an anime dedicated to fan-service, it was in no doubt that ecchi would play a part in the series. As a hot-blooded male I see nothing wrong with that and considering its targeted audience are probably lonely boys who get off on the harem setting, the series has done well in the visual department as it didn't cater for just one fan of ecchi either. Whilst most guys will agree that bigger breast is best, we cannot out rule that there are a certain few who's preference are palm-sized or have none at all. Asobi provides this.\\n\\n\r\nWatching the series in an upscaled HD format, artwork was passable as it's not mediocre yet I wouldn't class it as a masterpiece either. Everything is drawn well and animation is fluid throughout the series, which I believe should be a standard norm for any anime being produced as of 2010. Hence my rating of 6.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 6\\n\r\nLike its art, OP and ED are not groundbreaking, and at best suits its uplifting theme throughout the series. With Sphere playing their catchy J-pop tune \"Now loading... SKY!!\" on opening credits, one could feel that this is your average type harem or romance/comedy as it's a beat that unconsciously invites fandom into the series. One thing worth mentioning though is the series choice of seiyuu(voice actor). As a fan of Haruka Tomatsu(Rouge from Basquash, the twins from Nyan Koi! and Aoba of Cross Game just to name a few), they have decided to use her talents as the mains childhood friend in a tsundere type role. Now this may be another chance for the director to show more service and if it was, then it's pure win as Haruka is the type of seiyuu I prefer playing a tsundere-type lead over others in the market(eg. Rie Kugimiya).\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 6\\n\r\nWhilst each character on their own may seem clich\u00e9 and lackluster, it's the culmination of having them brought together that I guess makes this anime work. As clich\u00e9s go, we have your main Kio who is the center of the story. An uninspiring lead who nose-bleeds easily, but I really can't fault him as he does fall in your classic harem archetype of being the weak/shy boy who will stand up to anything regardless of fortitude. If only he wasn't as clueless, I might have liked this anime even more. Then we have his harem, Eris(alien cat-girl), Manami(childhood friend) and Aoi(school friend with mysterious powers). Whilst each heroine falls under their own archetype also, they do have redeeming qualities that can out rule you from rolling your eyes each time they go into clich\u00e9-mode. There are others worth mentioning, but I won't so not to spoil it for you, and my only advice in this area is to take each character introduced lightly as this anime pokes fun and may even parody certain archetypes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment & OverAll - 5\\n\r\nUnfortunately what started out as an anime with a lot of promise, due to the series being short and certain inconsistencies, it had left some questions unanswered and felt rushed at the end giving us a mediocre conclusion. There are a lot of flaws to this series from becoming a \"cut-above-the-rest\" type harem, but for an anime that runs at 12 episodes, I guess it's a lot better then some out there I could list out. Whilst the series may not be aiming for top spot in MAL or any other anime review site, what it does aim for is to give viewers 20+ minutes of mindless entertainment per episode, and give lonely boys out there some false hope that it may happen to them.\\n\\n\r\nIf you don't mind service, then this anime is worth the laughs and amusement. \\n\\n\r\nUNYAAA!!",

            "content": "~!~ WARNING: Spoilers ~!~\r\nJeez...I kinda wish I didn't even watch this anime to begin with. Maybe I'm just being harsh, but there wasn't something great about this. It was such a let-down. Something really promising at first and very quickly dropped as soon as you start.\r\n~ Story 2/10 ~\r\nI might be missing some accuracy because of the story being boring and unappealing so forgive me.\r\nThe main character is Kio Kakazu, an easy-going teen who seems to accept his new reality quite easy as his new friend is an alien cat girl, his childhood friend is a special agent, and his other friend is also aspecial agent as well. Essentially, this kid becomes pulled into a terrible situation by being involved with alien cat girls who came down to earth because...of the fish? While his friends work for the government as professional agents who are armed from head to toe.\\n\r\nThe story is quite ridiculous and almost stupid. It's not even really in a funny way. It ruins itself from this style. Sure, it could have been quirky and an interesting to watch if it didn't fail to live up to what it could have been.\\n\r\nThe very first episode is interesting as you watch an awesome fight scene. You find yourself clapping at the animation, even though it's awkward sometimes, and fight scenes. Something seems odd about it but you feel like this anime will be action packed and detailed.\\n\r\nWatching Asobi ni Iku yo is like having this amazing business man come to your door and offering you on an adventure that could save the universe. However, as soon as you accept his request and go to shake is robust, muscular hand, he turns into a wacky and cartoony clown that says \"Just kidding\" and slaps his genitals in your face before riding off into the sky on his own ass.\\n\r\nAfter this fight scene, you see our \"hero\" teen of the story who meets the first cat girl, Eris. Right after that, everything goes down hill.\\n\r\nReasons for why aliens are present on the earth seems silly to the point that you'll find yourself face palming why they take such huge and crucial parts of the story and dismiss them with simple reasons or childish remarks as if it's nothing. The episodes don't even seem to go anywhere or develop. If you even found ONE silver lining in the story, you will be crushed dearly by the ending.\\n\r\nI tried to take in atleast the romance factor of the anime. It's all like a harem, but maybe the anime will come through with a love complex between the two main characters, right?\\n\r\nNo.\\n\r\nYou will find the solution to the complicated love triangle and who out of the handful of girls that love this guy gets to be with them. The solution at the end? Well, why don't they just all marry him? It's not illegal atleast by cat alien standards.\\n\r\nThere is honestly no story. You could watch this and not even pay attention to the details and it would pretty much be the same thing. The only thing that seems to be story is the girls getting into ridiculous situations involving them to dress slutty or find some way to show off fan service.  If you went into the anime without expecting anything at all, you'll be fine. If you want a cool sci-fi about neko girls and a pleasant romance, you might want to turn around.\\n\r\nand run far away and never come back unless you are really bored.\\n\\n\r\n~ Art 9/10 ~\\n\r\nHonestly the only thing I seemed to enjoy was the art of this anime. The animation is very fluid although awkwardly clunky sometimes. The style they chose is quite lovely. The atmosphere is displayed so well as the scenes change from beaches to seas, mornings to afternoons, neighborhoods to malls, etc...\\n\r\nAll are greatly detailed and vibrant. It's colorful and enjoyable. Characters are nicely designed along with it's beautiful scenes and color. It's as if someone put lots of love and care into this factor, and I almost feel really bad for the artist for the fact that he wasn't complimented by the music, writers, or really anyone. If there was anyone who was truly serious about this product, it was the artist.\\n\\n\r\n~ Sound 7/10 ~\\n\r\nThere isn't much to say about the soundtrack. There really isn't anything special about it. The music isn't bad but it isn't memorable either. It's basic and meets the standards but that's all. However, it was nice from time to time. It was a decent soundtrack that was even very fitting sometimes. Voice actors were also skilled. If their scripts were better, I would've been more impressed by them. Although, it seems they were working with limited material and didn't even seem to take it seriously sometimes.\\n\\n\r\n~ Characters 4/10 ~\\n\r\nCardboard cut-outs and and big boobs. That's it.\\n\r\nThe only thing flat in this show is the characters. But atleast their chests aren't.\\n\r\nThe female characters are basic and stereotypical or sometimes have no personality besides boobs. Other characters are interesting. However, there isn't anyone too special or unique. You'd find that sometimes, the robot characters that don't even talk have more personality than the characters who talk.\\n\r\nIt isn't dreadful as the dialogue isn't atrocious and the personalities do have some shape. Overall, though, it's not much and your characters are mostly there because they are important to the \"story\" or they are just sex appeal.\\n\\n\r\n~ Enjoyment 4/10 ~\\n\r\nThere isn't much to enjoy from this anime. What could be good and have excellent potential seem to be held back. The fight scenes would seem serious and well detailed while intense. At the same time, no one is murdered and you'll find enemies taken down easily by cutesy cliche' magical girl styles.\\n\r\nTons of tanks and helicopters and soldiers arrive and they are disarmed by a girl with a hammer, the vehicles disappearing and the soldiers naked and defenseless. The action is so held back. It seems like they want to be serious but can't be.\\n\r\nOne moment you'll have soldiers, and then have toy robot cat drones firing lasers and destroying matter to enter a boat. Whatever happens in the anime, there isn't an explanation. If it happened, that's all there is to it. Any questions will go unanswered unless it's unimportant. Nothing besides the art draws you in and so many things are a let-down. The romance is poor, the action had potential, the characters are poor, and the story is the biggest disappoint. Not even the ending was enjoyable. It's as if nothing happens through the entire thing even though so many things transpire. Why? WHY?!\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nEverything besides the art was lacking greatly. Nothing drew you in. Nothing satisfied you. If you go in with expectations, you leave disappointed unless you only like fan service. Nothing seems to happen really. You can watch the first few episodes and the last episode and it would almost be the same as watching the entire thing.\\n\r\nThere isn't much to watch besides fan service and art. Maybe you could pull out something from this. If you like something funny and sexy scenes, maybe this anime is for you. Who knows, it might be your tastes. Anything else....well you will surely be disappointed.",

            "content": "Warning this review may contain spoilers.  It's the first review I've ever written for this site; therefore you notice it isn't 'quite' in the site's unofficial format.  Which as far as I can tell is almost a checklist of the top five scores and their final overall.\r\nAsobi ni Iku yo!\r\nSurprisingly; good story.  It's a short story format; only three 'arcs' maybe four.  All interconnected and they all had a point.  They constantly fore-shadowed things that would appear in later episodes.\r\nThe echii/harem side of things...  Was almost sidelined by the gun-fire and explosions.  It's a fairly straight up action/adventure/sci-fishow with quite a few parodies and references.\\n\\n\r\nThe 'bounce' factor was 'almost' down-played.  First three episodes they stared; after that Eris's mighty bust is constantly present but hardly an active focus.\\n\\n\r\nIt''s a very soft 'melo melo' 'pure love' sort of echii; they even make reference to this in the op.  They kissed...  Once.  Occasionally there was an accidental infringement scene; especially in the first half.  They ended up in swim suits twice; in one case pantsu was involved due to a tail hole.\\n\\n\r\nI'm sorry; this was far less echii then I expected from all the descriptions and feed back.  The story wasn't focused on it; it existed but as a back drop for the actual story.  \\n\\n\r\nThe lead...  Is Too Dense To Take Seriously.  He also isn't unlucky enough to be considered a plot trigger.  I can't even remember his name despite it being used dozens on dozens of times.  He could have been anyone in that situation; I firmly believe that his only reason for being in the anime was to be the viewers 'avatar'.  His personality is a blank non-descriptive hole.\\n\\n\r\nFor that very reason I'm grateful; for there are moments, songs, and various scenes which where the anime rose far above the general harem feel.  Tora-dora had more sexual tension...  Seriously.  The echi is existant, it is a small part of; however it is not the entirety of this anime...  Not by a long shot.\\n\\n\r\nBe it the lonely spaceman, the various parodies, music, political reactions, and ect.  There was far more to this show then just echi, oppai, and the harem way.\\n\\n\r\nTo lost adventurers, crazy cults, moon gazing, robot independence, political conspiracy, and parodies without end.  Kampai!\\n\\n\r\nI gave this show an 8.  For excellent action, some particularly stirring pieces of sound/music, a solid story line, average voice actors, so-so echii, and because on occasion...  Rare occasion.  Amidst those short twelve episodes...  I found a scene that could touch my soul.\\n\\n\r\nI expected the occasional grin, a guffaw, to stare in awe of the bounce.  I didn't expect to find serious messages buried amidst the comedy.\\n\\n\r\nYou can't take this show seriously; it's a light watch.  However if you can enjoy the genre; then don't hesitate to watch it just because of a few negative comments.  There are some things in this short little gem that are well worth checking out.\\n\\n\r\nThey are hidden and often to the point; much like any good comedians...  There are dark/terrible truths buried beneath the humor.",

            "content": "I saw this anime was ecchi and gave it a try, the story is average, there's no complexity about it but that's not the most important while watching ecchi anime anyway, in a way the story is kinda interesting and is a good ecchi if you're looking just for ''ecchiness'', it has decent comedy, good characters and the assistroids were entertaining.\r\nStory\r\nThe story is simple, a Catgirl named Eris is sent to the earth from the planet Catnia to investigate the earth's culture, she stumbles with Kakazu's uncle and he takes her home because she's a cat not because he's creepy, meanwhile there's commotion from certainsecret groups of who is going to take Eris, and because these organizations keep creating incidents to take her, the Catnia gals make Kakazu's house the first and new Embassy of Catnia on the planet, there was a race of dogs that came before them to earth and mantained themselves in secret, until a dog girl from Dognia wanted to kick out the ''Catnians'' from earth and wants to destroy Catnia and ''Dognians'' will start some conflicts against the ''Catnians'' because Dogs hate Cats. Story is weird but fine because of that juicy uncensored ''plot''.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation\\n\r\nThe animation is very good, the ecchi parts were visually pleasant, it was well made, nothing much to say other than censor-kun doesn't appear in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe VA is good, the music is good, in one episode the first living assistroid goes to the earth and in the end she sings a good song which Chihara Minori performs.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThey are good, Aoi is interesting, Eris is naive but likeable and not annoying as you would imagine naive characters are, Manami is good and Kakazu is not a wuss but also not a pervert but the ones that i liked the most were the assistroids specially Chu Yun Fat.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nI really liked the ecchi this has to offer but the comedy is decent and the characters were good, there's also winks at other animes like Hidan no Aria, Kampfer (which was mediocre) and others, i had a good time watching this.",

            "content": "My score follows the MAL word associated with it; hence the 4 is a 'Bad'. However, everyone's tastes are different and encourage you to read the points below rather than just my rating.\r\n-A few Clich\u00e9s.\r\nNow there is not really anything bad with having clich\u00e9s if you like them. You got your cat girl and a few other characters living with the dense and useless lead. If these are your cups of tea they are implemented pretty well. However, if you are looking for something new there is not a lot to offer.\r\n-This is a harem show, \r\nYou will find yourself rooting for Aoi, like me,or the cat girl Eris. However, the show is biased and behind Aoi most of the time, even the childhood friend Manami is giving her assistance regretfully. While the male lead is thick, the interaction between Aoi and Manami made this show enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\n- and it has a Relative solution to the harem.\\n\r\nI am saying this in partly to not to expect a completely open end; It does well to provide some closure so you don't kick and scream when it is over. However, i am not praising it.\\n\\n\r\n-Lots of fighting.\\n\r\nI am surprised that Action is not one of the tags for this show actually. The first two or so episodes are highly enjoyable and give you high expectations for the rest of the series. While the action dies down over time essentially everyone, except Kio, provides us with a lot of enjoyable gun fights. Don't worry though, the bullets later on only destroy non-organic matter!\\n\\n\r\n-This show suffers from little plot in between the start and end.\\n\r\nThe integration of Eris into the cast, the first arc, is enjoyable and fast paced. However, soon it reverts into a episodic style that slowly grows stale, and the only sanction is the development of Aoi. As if the producers noticed this, they slap in an ending arc which results in our lame Kio saving Earth.\\n\r\n In\\n\\n\r\n-Character development is minimal.\\n\r\nThe only two characters focused on are Manami and Aoi. Both Kio and Eris lay out the road to our story, but there is very little focus on them growing in any way. Without spoiling the end, the two girls provide the bulk of the development as they struggle to understand their emotions.\\n\\n\r\n-Low comedic value.\\n\r\nI am not easily amused. While the assistroids are entertaining to watch, i wouldn't claim to have laughed at all during this show.",

            "content": "Hey I just want to start off by saying that this is only a review based off of my own opinion and personal experience watching the show. So for anyone who's seen the show and may be offended or otherwise, I apologize in advance. Cat Planet Cuties, as it is dubbed by Funimation, revolves around a young high schooler named Kio Kakuza, who one day meets a young, beautiful, busty girl with cat ears and a tail, named Eris, claiming to be an alien. Apparently her and other members of her race, came to Earth in order to set up friendly relations with humans. Notsoon after though, Kio and Eris are constantly being pursued by multiple factions with different plans in mind. \\n\\n\r\nStory 4/10: The story was fairly decent at best, but not all that interesting. Now I'm open to all types of different genres, in fact ecchi/harem's are among my favorites, which is what this show classifies as. However I think as a Sci-fi this would be more enjoyable with more action. It's pretty much just a bunch of fan service although I rather enjoy fan service. \\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10: I normally don't have any complaints about the artwork in a show and I'm not going to start now. The art isn't anything unique or new, but it's not horrible either.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10: I thought the soundtrack was pretty good and nothing to really complain about.  I especially found the opening theme rather enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 6/10: The character development is fair at best, nothing all that special. You got your typical girl from another world who for no real reason falls in love with the main protagonist and is normally as ditzy as she is big-boobed. Then you got the child-hood friend who's hot and totally in love with the main character, but just can't admit it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it's an okay anime and it might be worth your time, but hey. \\n\\n\r\nAnyways this is my review and I hoped you enjoyed it. Thanks.",

This partnership will not only enhance the prosperity and trust between us, but, also, to affirm our Goddess and Savior is the one and only Eris. We swear to assist and provide  protection against enemies that endanger the safety and well-being of our Goddess and her fellow Catians. In return, we only ask that the Goddess, herself, graces us with her presences from time to time.\r\nSIX ORDINANCES\r\nIn an effort to build a stronger relationship with our fellow Catians, we have observed 12videos that detail our Goddess\u2019 life and her daily encounters with Earth\u2019s surroundings. We have, therefore, written six ordinances that follow our Goddess\u2019 behavior. All current and future members should follow these ordinances:\\n\\n\r\n1) Thou Shalt Worship Cat Ears and Cat Tails\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2013 Cat ears and cat tail have been adored by hundreds of people around the world. They evoke emotions of cuteness, of softness, and of fluffiness. We have satisfied our love by wearing fake cat ears and cat tails. That is, until the arrival of our Goddess, Eris; her authentic cat ears and cat tails prove that the real ones are far superior to fakes. We can toss aside our fakes, and worship the real ones. Praise those lovely cat ears and cat tails!\\n\\n\r\n2) Thou Shalt Not Kill\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2013 As stated by Catian law, murder is not permitted. As such, bullets and other devices that dissolve inorganic matter, while preserving organic matter was developed. We approve such a respectable law and have adopted it ourselves. The results were impressive! Our Goddess battled against tanks, but they were easily dissolved by the touch of her hammer, leaving behind no vehicle and only naked men. Our Goddess\u2019 friends used magic bullets on assassins, and on Russian soldiers. The results: nothing left behind, but naked individuals. What our Goddess is telling us is to humiliate our enemies by stripping them nude.\\n\\n\r\n3) Enemies of Catia Shall Be Our Enemy\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2013 In the beginning, our enemies were members of the Beautiful Contact led by Maki Itokazu, Aoi from the Immigration Bureau of Japan, and Manami Kinjou from the CIA recruitment program. Their target was to eliminate our Goddess, Eris. However, one person stood by her, his name was Kio Kakazu. This young boy stopped the attacks and managed to recruit and convince Aoi, Manami Kinjou, and Maki Itokazu into saving Eris from a military compound. Then, afterwards, our brilliant Goddess sent a message to her mothership, telling them that the grilled beef was excellent, which prompted them to appear overhead. They signed a treaty with the Japanese Government and, thus, are not considered an enemy. This prevented future attacks from the Beautiful Contact, Immigration Bureau of Japan, and the CIA. Then, a new enemy appeared called Dogisia. They attacked a ship with our Goddess and her friends on board, hoping to sink the ship and take our Goddess with it. They attacked a camp site where our Goddess and her friends were eating. They raided the Catian Embassy (i.e. Kio\u2019s house). And they attacked a Catian ship, which had other catians. In the end, they were annihilated in space. We assisted our Goddess and her friends by providing money, weapons, and fighting maids. Fuck with us! And our maids will kill you!\\n\\n\r\n4) Thou Shalt Wear Skimpy Clothing or None At All\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2013 It would seem our Goddess loves to walk around in bare clothing, wearing, sometimes, only underwear and a long shirt. Most times, she wears her alien cat suit and swimsuit to flaunt her large breast, a very proud thing to display. Her friends, on the other hand, go to more extreme lengths. Members of Catian mothership, wore nothing, but typical Japanese swimsuits to a negotiation, it was very effective. Aoi and Manami sometimes fight in ridiculous clothing, such as a Gundam suit and a playboy suit. They, also, fought with no clothing at all. Based on our Goddess\u2019 and her friends\u2019 behavior, it would seem wearing skimpy clothing is appropriate for any situation, as everyone around them seem completely oblivious to it.\\n\\n\r\n5) Thou Shalt Forgo Traits That Develop One\u2019s Character\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2013 Our Goddess has encountered many people on Earth, and they all share one similarity. They all lack some character traits or backstory. The members of Catian mothership, what is their backstory, why do they want to fly this specific ship and their reasons for exploring the galaxy? Well, to us, members of Underside of Kitten Paw, we have no need to understand this information. Kio Kakazu seems to be a good-natured person, who is kind, caring, and really dense when it comes to love. Aoi is your typical shy girl whose crush just so happens to be near her target person. Manami Kinjou is a gun frantic with a tomboy attitude and personality, who is always complaining. Maki Itokazu is a teacher, the leader of the Beautiful Contact and that\u2019s it, from thereon, she complains that our Goddess, Eris, is not a real alien. The villain, Janes, has a motive for her actions, but her personality is one-dimensional, it never changes. We, as members of this organization, should strive to not have any traits that develop one\u2019s character.\\n\\n\r\n6) Thou Shalt Respect the Catian Customs and Laws\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2013 There were several Catian Laws that we would like to acknowledge: (1) Polyamory \u2013 when a man can have more than one lover, this practice was the solution to Kio\u2019s problem when he was loved by Aoi, Manami, and Eris, our Goddess. This directly resulted in a harem ending. (2) On the 16th birthday, our Goddess went into heat and was having sexual desires, unfortunately, it hindered her fighting abilities and, thus, she had to take a pill to end her mating period. (3) All Catians must own an assist-a-roid, this machine can pretty do anything, except talk, they have no mouths and no emotionally responses.\\n\\n\r\nBy following these six ordinances, we hope that our relationship with Catians rises. We hope that one day, we may obtain a power to grow cat ears and cat tails. We hope that our Goddess continues to grace us with her presences.\\n\\n\r\nAll Hail Our Goddess!\\n\\n\r\nAll Hail Eris!\\n\\n\r\nAll Hail Eris!",

Asobi ni Iku yo! gradually turned into some form of harem story where the indecisive omega male gets the ladies. The series is a love letter  to cat lovers and the technology featured is something to think about. The series is greatly flawed by the holes in its plot. Overall, Asobi ni Iku yo provides light-hearted entertainment that's neither spectacular nor absolutely horrible.",

            "content": "Ok, first of all, this is my first time writing a review, but I felt like I need to after reading the biased, argumentative feelings this anime brought to the table. \r\nI am going to start out with the negatives, just because they are the first things I noticed within the anime, but if you read on, I guarantee positives will come from it. \r\n1) The story had literally no character development whatsoever, everyone just happened to either be part of the CIA, a terrorist organization, or the immigration bureau. and all be centered around this one guy who happens to be who the ecchialien takes a liking to. The story itself is plot-hole city, and the ending is disappointing as hell, with so much unexplained, but I still recommend watching it for yourself.\\n\\n\r\n2) This show literally refused not be be the cliche of the age-old cats vs. dogs scenario, and when I first saw it, I was like, 'This is just stupid.' And it was. Extremely. \\n\\n\r\n3) This story is fan service central, with all the main characters being in positions where they are at least half-naked at least once per episode, and it just got to the point where it was a bit ridiculous. But, being the pervert that I am, I found myself questioning it because 'Why draw so much hentai if you are just going to blur it out? Make a censored and uncensored version, or just pull off a Love Hina (If you know what I mean) and just use the characters hair or the surroundings to hide it, instead of just white clouds of piss-off. \\n\\n\r\n4) The story itself ended somewhat half-heartedly, with an easy to create OVA that could have followed it. Personally, I think they ran out of money in the budget.\\n\\n\r\nOk, now after going through that, let's explain the fun parts of this show.\\n\\n\r\n1) Personally, I loved  the ending, which I can't get into right now, but just know that it was satisfying enough that everyone wins. Its like the show couldn't decide where its fan-base put its faith, but I think they made the right decision. Its what every (at least male) fan wants to see. But like I said in my disappointments, it ended half-heartedly.\\n\\n\r\n2) All the aliens were female, and that is kind of the reason I wanted to watch this anime. It added flavor to my list of anime angels, cosplayers, pokemon, and incest. Sadly, each and every one of those is true.\\n\\n\r\n3) There was lots of action that actually fit the story, and it kind of off-balanced the whole \"stupid\" part of it, and it is something that kept the story going.\\n\\n\r\n4) Lastly, I thought the art of this was beautiful, it was so tropical and colorful, yet fit each and every surrounding that the characters decided to settle down in. I gave art a 9, character and sound an 8, enjoyment a 7 and story a 6. My Overall was 7. I hope you guys found this review helpful!",

            "content": "Nyaa!!!!  Alien kitty goodness.  I just have to say that if an alien who had the form of a hot girl with kitty ears and a tail, I would question if she was real, or just cos-playing.  Wouldn't you?  If memory serves me right everyone just accepted her and was like \"hey we are having a party want to join us?\"   WHAT?!  The main humor is that since she is an alien she doesn't know what is considered normal on earth.  So one of the first books that she reads is a book that was found underKio's bed.  I am just going to let you think about that.\\n\\n\r\nI like how they emphasize the realness of the cat ears and tails.  How they move and twitch.  I thought that it was a nice little touch.  Little details like that are honestly are what make certain anime better than others.  You can't just throw a bunch of big boob girls together and make a good anime...... Well maybe you can, but that is besides the point. the point that I was trying to make.  The point that I wanted to make is that I have watched a fair amount of anime, and when I see things that I can relate to other anime it puts a smile on my face.  ^_^\\n\\n\r\nOpening theme was too easy going sounding.  It should have been a little more fast pace in my opinion.  I say this because the main idea of this anime is the fight for earth, along with the love story on the side.\\n\\n\r\nOkay I mean really?!  Both Manami and Aoi are secret agents?!  I mean how much more farfetched can you get.  Fine I mean we are already taking about aliens why not go all the way.  I may not have not liked the idea personally at first, but the way that both of the them get incorporated into the story line was very interesting. \\n\\n\r\nOMG I love the robots!  It was so funny because at one point they have numbers drawn on their foreheads since nobody can tell them apart.  They can't talk so they communicate using a sign.  All they have to do is turn the sign and the words on it changes.  It's soo cool.  \\n\r\n...But, not as cool as the gun that makes clothes disappear.  I gave this anime a 7 since I thought that the story line was something new for me and I enjoyed it.  New things are always good.\\n\r\nIt may not be new to you but it was a new experience for me.",

            "content": "Well, at first I didn\u2019t know anything about this. I guessed by the name it may be pretty fan service oriented but when I turned on the first episode, it actually looked like it would be serious. Boy, was I wrong with that idea. It turns into a big harem mess. It\u2019s almost just like Please Teacher mixed with other Harem shows. \r\nIt\u2019s all about food, boobs, and very little bit about the Sci-fi stuff. Let me give you an example of how this show doesn\u2019t take itself too seriously. Eris beats a million tanks with hammers, even taking the clothing of the tank guysinside. And just when I thought the show was about to end, the show got even stranger with the cat girls going to a meeting wearing school girl swimsuits with a magical girl transformation showing naked images. The third show even starts out with a version of the Star Trek opening altered for the cat aliens. \\n\\n\r\nI do have a question, where the heck are all the male cat boys? I with I could see more diverse gender to this instead of all the girls\u2026 and this isn\u2019t just because I\u2019m a girl. I do like a lot of designs for anthro girls but I also like the ideas for the men as well. The only male we do see from cat world is an image of his mouth. We see no tail or ears and even his eyes are hidden from us.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a lot of references to Star Trek and a couple other shows that any Trekie would probably fall in love with it. There is a special episode also that isn\u2019t all that funny. Episode 9 talks more about how that catians and earthlings feel the same about a song that played for a special Sci-fi anime. The song is rather beautiful and gives the feeling of loneliness in space. \\n\\n\r\nKio is just like Kei from Please Teacher. His voice, personality, almost everything feels pretty much like a copy of him except for the stand still-thing. He lets people push him around mostly, and is pretty much a guy that acts older then he is. He even stays with a perverted uncle. The girls feel like they were all pushed onto him and it really is too much like they just pushed every type of supernatural or alien idea into one small little area of Japan. The only character with any real since is Aoi. The reason why I say that is she doesn\u2019t get made right away when Kio ends up with cat girls hanging all over him because of reading a magazine.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is standard. Kio even looks like Kei from Please Teacher and Eris looks much like a sexual version of Horo from Spice and Wolf. Most designs feel like they were stolen from other animes. Its standard all the way threw from the character design to the background.\\n\\n\r\nThe English voices are standard too, and yet seem to fit with the style of the show. It\u2019s pretty much standard all the way threw so nothing special but yet I guess I could say that it would be pretty fun to see how it pans out. I would really see this as a watch show.\\n",

Of course.\r\nArt (7/10) - The animation was most likely the best aspect of this show. It was nice, smooth... and to be honest, it is uncanny how much Eris looks like Holo (Spice and Wolf).\r\nSound (5/10) - Simple, nice songs over visuals that ascent theecchi fan-service of the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (5/10) - You have your average MC in a Harem; coupled with an alien girl, girl-next-door, and a crush girl from school.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (6/10) - Typical ecchi-harem anime. Not something you'd hate, but not something you'd love either. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (5.6/10) - This show wasn't the best. I found it hard to get through it about half-way. There are definitely worse ones than this, but there are SO many better ones. As much as I hear people raving about Neko characters, this is my first time actually seeing one in an anime.",

            "content": "I just don't understand why people don't like this and found it boring because I for one loved it. The characters, the art, the music, and the overall funny/happy atmosphere. First off lets talk about my favorite character Eris. Eris is a alien cat girl who was sent to earth to learn more about it when she meets Kio who was kind enough to aid her on her mission.  after the first day on earth we learn that she is always kind, always asking questions, has a childlike innocence, cares deeply about her friends, LOVES food, and she is mostly in heat which ifound funny.  My only complaint is that she is equipped with a power suit and has a hammer that can make tanks vanish, but she only has 3 fighting scenes while the other characters got to fight in all of the episodes, but she is still awesome. Another thing i liked about this show was the art. The art in this was amazing, there were colors everywhere and the amount of detail they put in for even the smallest things like the leave, the sidewalk, and the cars were outstanding. And last but not least the atmosphere. This show always had a happy vibe to it. There were no sad back stories, none of the good guys died, and at the end all three girls decided to share Kio together so everything worked out in the end. This anime had such a good vibe that i watched it over and over again, but I cant seem to find another anime like this, making this a one of a kind masterpiece.  I just wished that they kept it on air so we could have seen how this story progressed.",

            "content": "Ok, so this is more like an extraordinary situation were black ops mixed with ET and added with child's play kinda thing, I like the characters the way that they were drawn and the setting, were it is set on the southern part of Japan, in Okinawa. Eris, the lead female character seem to have the combination of Lala from \"To Love Ru\" and  Horo from \"Spice and Wolf,\" but just like any light novel animes it is still a combination of different genre for each episode which by the way I kinda hate the musical part about a space man in ep9. Thenagain that first assistant droid  could  had a longer role within the series. My main criticism is the authors and illustrators idea of arming the 2 girls Minami and Aoi which basically doesn't have the right body mass to weapon recoil ration e.g. when Aoi pull up a 3.57 Colt Python against her chauffeur/ handler I'm surprise that she can handle a gun that weight about 5lbs and has a recoil of baseball batter when fired for a pettit girl like her to handle, if a girl with the body mass and height like that of Aoi were fire that kind of gun, she would also get hurt in the process because the gun's blow back would literally throw itself back  towards her co'z she's unable to control it. For Minami, she was branded by Kio as gun otaku, if she is then why is ep6 she requested for a M134 Minigun that is not mounted in a tripod only to find out that it's just to heavy for her to lift ? As a gun otaku it is important that you know what gun you can handle and what you can't handle, that doesn't seem to be the case with Minami who only has an average IQ for guns, also, Aoi is seen using a Dragunov Sniper rifle  in ep8, black ops usually shy away from that kind of rifle because of it's limited accuracy most would either use an H&K PSG 1 sniper rifle, A1 Arctic Warfare or Remington Bolt Action Rifle. Also there were instances were the girls handled various 9mm pistols but can still prove to much for a petite girl to handle. However I can give credit for the illustrator for making Aoi use the S&W 38 police special for the rest of the series  it is basically a kind of gun which petite teenagers can handle. I also noticed that in ep7 there is a German WW2 MG42  featured, doesn't  the illustrator know that such weapon is no longer being manufactured and the M249 SAW is the most widely used machine gun amongst armed forces like Japan's SDF? \\n\\n\r\nYou know, I think authors and illustrators should not just focus on any gun for the character, it is important that a certain gun should match the character's physique, age and combat role, if we'll look at the more matured characters in the anime we can seen that the guns they possess matched their physique   like Antonia's maid which is understandable that they also functions as her body guards, in fact, it should be Kio's uncle who should be possessing the 3.57 Colt Python and M134 Minigun in the first place, as for the Dragunov Sniper Rifle it kinda looks good for Maki Itokazu (Kio's teacher) to handle it.  So just like that certain guns should be match like jewelry for certain character.\\n\\n\r\nTrivia: It is Illegal in Japan for a citizen to own a gun, do you know that not all law enforcement officers in Japan carry a gun? In fact only the SDF, SAT and those assign for body guard duty were allowed to carry a firearms. Even thought Japan's police were trained to shoot, their standard issue Nambu cal 37 Revolver were always left in the station under lock and key only to be use for very special emergencies.",

In the very first 2 episodes they probably fit like 5 episodes worth of information which made me feel really confused to the point where I was just like \"WTF?! How comes she's doing that?! Wh-What the heck is wrong with him?! Why is she that if she's that andthat being that... why is this that?!\".

            "content": "Overview: Asobi Ni Kyuo is a fun light hearted tale about an alien cat girl from space.  This quickly turns into a light ecchi anime with more steriotypical charecters than you can paw  at.\r\nStory: Giving the story a 4 is being kind.  This show does two things that should never be mixed in the same show.  It tries to take itself seriously, when the plot is \"CAT GIRLS FROM SPACE\", by attempting to explain the technology in detail.  If your going to go with something that is overtop and just plain fun stick with that, dont try to explain it.As for the actual plot its more about the relationships between the 3 main charecters than anything else.\\n\\n\r\nArt:  This is a pretty show.  Most anime now a days are fun to look at if nothing else, and this one is no exception.  That said there is nothing hear that is new or revolutionary. (not that there has to be).\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound is good, but I can think of several shows that are more efficient in there use of sound combined with visuals.  The show has the right visuals, but not a good synthesis from the two of them.  I find the sound to be the weaker element.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: All the bad, or annoying things about this show aside.  Things blow up, charecters get into fights and make up, this is a good example of keeping some ones attention while not really saying anything while doing so.  For some reason this show IS fun to watch even if its all rather pointless and completely riddled with plot holes.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Note:  I pick on Asobi no Kyuo because I think its a show that had a lot of potential, but with all the stereotypes, and the show taking itself to seriously in some aspects, while being completely crazy and nutty in other aspects makes for a some what disconcerting sensation, most noticeable at the end when the show realizes something needs to explode and they stretch the climax into 3 episodes whtn the problem could have been resolved in 5 minutes.",

            "content": "THIS IS A SPOILER FREE REVIEW (minus some detail from the first episode).\r\nFrom the tags alone, you know this is a little ecchi and a harem show. As such, you have some standard tropes such as the very deliberate buffet of girls of varying ages and breast sizes. You have the super-trope character types such as the loli, the childhood friend, the school friend, and the magical/space/angel girlfriend from nowhere who instantly falls in love with the boring, bespectacled main character who's too nice and stupidly oblivious to:\r\n* Notice or care about any of the sexiness around him\r\n* Stand up for himself when one ofhis girls beats him and throws things at him for things that totally aren't his fault.\\n\\n\r\n* Ever become anything more than a piece of the background. He's really only there to give the girls something to fight over.\\n\\n\r\nThere are harem shows that are pretty damned decent or uniquely entertaining, but this isn't it. It's watchable, but only barely (especially if you've seen enough anime to get pretty sick of this formulaic nonsense). Just about every episode and every plot device is tired, overdone, and low-effort. It gets progressively worse throughout the series such that my score for the show dipped an entire point based only on the last episode. \\n\\n\r\nWith a renewed level of suspension of disbelief that I wasn't willing to provide, the show goes whole-hog on stupid with every character engaging in actions that make no sense and drama that's so fast-forward that it's impossible to have any emotional investment.\\n\\n\r\nThis is really a show that's only worth picking up if you have nothing better to watch or have a particular love for harem shows... just don't expect much. This is about as typical as they come.",

Cat Planet Cuties delivers a fun anime, with great art(bouncy boobs).  I was originally expecting an anime that I would hate thestory line (as I usually do) but the plot has enough original plot twists that I didn't drop it. The characters are pretty flat and predictable, but just like the story there is enough of a change to keep it interesting.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are in between animes and you want something with good art(bouncy boobs) to watch, by all means give Cat Plant Cuties a shot.",

            "content": "About the Ecchi\r\nWell, after I watch the hole anime (with a lot of difficulty, because the story wasn't very good) I saw something cool. Everyone may say this is a bit close of To Love Ru, and I actually would say that too. That's because some of the ecchi and sexy scenes are close to To Love Ru, and they are very good. But there are almost none of them.\r\nAbout the Story\r\nJust don't watch it. What the story focus is to keep showing the difficulty for some girls to show their love to a boy. You may think about some lots of ecchi scenes, boobsand everything, but no. All you see is \"Oh, I like that boy\" and \"Oh, you like him too? You should confess your love to him!\" AND THAT'S ALL.\\n\\n\r\nAt the same time the story that's written upside is happening (what a interesting story), it tells about a little fight between planets. I can't tell not much about this, because I didn't focus a lot in this anime. But what I can say is that this isn't interesting too.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nBoooooooooring. Like I sad, when one of them is the coordinator of the ecchi scenes, the others are just like \"should or i should I say that I love him? The other girl is so much beautiful than me, so I have no chance.\" I just like a bit the alien one, Eris. The protagonist is boring too, he is just like... Yuuki Rito, but with no perverted scenes, no comedy and no cool.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound\\n\\n\r\nThose are acceptable. I don't have too much to comment about it, but at least it is better than Dragon Ball Super. (hehehehehe)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nOk, maybe I should play Guitar Hero, GTA, Minecraft, I should clean the  house, study while watching this anime. You won't concentrate it even if you try, because you won't like. I'll just give a bit highter grade on this because I played videogames while watching this, so it wasn't soo boring. But i wouldn't like watch this anime with all my concentration in it.\\n\\n\r\nObservations\\n\\n\r\nWell, I would say that's an anime to you to watch at the same time you keep playing video games, or doing something. It is one that you think. \"Oh, I will watch this anime to increase my animelist\". That's All.\\n\r\nSorry for the bad english, I don't live in an english speaking country.\\n\\n",

This show was basically \u201chow much stuff from other anime can we jam-pack into our anime to make it seem cool?\u201d the anime. Sure I could point out some \u201cplot points\u201d like how an alien race who look like humans but have catears and tails with advanced technology have come to earth to make peace but another enemy of the cats is already on earth and they are bad because\u2026 They are? Also 3 girls who have either \u201cinsert new girl here syndrome\u201d, a SUPER SECRET job or have CrAzY carrier ideas, all seem to like some random guy who seems to be always ok with everything regardless of what circumstances he\u2019s in but ultimately he will do anything to protect a girl he knows jack shit about. If you would like to think this show has a story, go ahead, be my guest.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Considering most of the characters don\u2019t get much screen time, come out of nowhere, or just have generic tropes for character architypes I\u2019d give them a 6/10. It\u2019s not like I dislike the characters, but ultimately most of them are unimportant. The only true characters are the main 3 girls and semi generic boy wonder, and besides maybe the main girl the other 2 highly embrace their stereotypes to a tee. \\n\\n\r\nArt: In no way was the art terrible I\u2019d say 8/10 because it\u2019s not unique or anything. I\u2019d say that the animators had some fun with a show that didn\u2019t have much of a plot to follow so props to them for making everything look good. Not much else to say about the art.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I can\u2019t really give much of a rating one way or the other; the upside to the sound was we got to hear an English rendition of \u201cLonely Spaceman\u201d, other then that I\u2019d say the rating is 7/10 just because of that English rendition.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Because of the lack of plot it was hard to say it was anything special, but there were a few comedic scenes and I wasn\u2019t straining myself to watch the show really, I had to leave and come back to it a few time though so I\u2019d say 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Overall rating 6/10-watch once or buy it. Why watch it once? Because it has some good content but wasn\u2019t something to write home about, something to watch when you\u2019re bored. Why buy it? It\u2019s cheap as hell and you can add an anime to your collection. Why 6/10? Because I can\u2019t say it\u2019s worth anything higher but it was enjoyable enough to not be 5/10.\\n\\n\r\nLet me tell others 2 things, 1: I will not tell you or encourage you to give the same rating, this is just my personal opinion on this show and 2: honestly I\u2019m doing this review and other reviews as a hobby and for my own \u201canime records\u201d so to speak, so if you see this and don\u2019t like it just ignore it honestly because its more for me then to help others in the long run.\\n",

            "content": "Anime: Cat Planet Cuties\r\nGenre: Action, Romantic Comedy, Harem, Science fiction\r\nAge Rating: Teen+\r\nStudio: AIC+\r\nMusic: Tomoki Kikuya\r\nAuthor: Okina Kamino\r\nDub/Sub: Dub\r\nEcchi Level: Nosebleed (Boobs everywhere)\r\nOoOoO\r\nHonestly, I have no idea what to say about this one. I found this one on a whim and watched it...because I haven't seen a catgirl anime in a while I guess? Alright, so let's get this started.\r\nThe story follows Kio Kakazu, your typical anime teenager who goes to highschool, has trouble with girls, yada yada. He goes to a party near the beach and ends up meeting a girl with startlingly realistic cat ears and tail. She also has more curves than theAbsolute Towers in Canada, so that's a bonus I guess. Due to anime circumstances, she ends up in his bed at home, and when he wakes up, he finds out that she's actually an alien who came to Earth to visit and collect knowledge on the planet.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I'm trying to figure out who this was marketed towards. They have a catgirl cult in the damn anime, but it seems like those kinds of people are the only ones who would watch this more than once. Each episode was about as aimless as an anime can get. I didn't feel like anything was accomplished...ever. One moment they're on the beach, then they're under attack, then a new character comes in, then magic is involved? Like, I have really bad ADD but even I saw how insane the direction of this anime went.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, it can all be summed up by saying that it's a fight of cats vs. dogs over who gets to partner with Earth. Everything in between is inconsequential and really has no effect on the rest of the story. To be honest, this anime seemed more like the fantasy of a gun-loving otaku who isn't that great of a story teller. The detail on the weapons was awesome, granted, but did little to help add anything to the story.\\n\\n\r\nAnd because I'm a sucker for romance, we have to talk about this part. Kio, is fucking boring. If he walked up to an automatic door, I doubt it would open for him. That's how non-present he is. I get that most harem anime portray the main protagonist as an average guy. But typically, the attraction of the females is either drawn in by something out of his control (Highschool DxD and Tenchi Muyo), or the character is not very special, but strong of character (Monster Musume). But Kio is probably the most minuscule presence in the entire anime. Nothing about him is interesting. Even his voice actor, Aaron Dismuke (famed for roles such as Alphonse Elric and Lucifer) couldn't make him more interesting, which sucks because for a good actor like him to have to force himself down to that flat, uninteresting tone is a travesty.\\n\\n\r\nAlright...back on topic, there's really no reason any of the girls should be so madly in love with Kio. Eris, the main catgirl in question was given food. Aoi likes watching movies with him. That's it, no profound moment of clarity where they found their love for him, just he was there and they hadn't seen anyone better I suppose. Manami gets a slide solely because she grew up with Kio, and who knows, maybe he had more personality than a pair of chopsticks when they were younger. That being said, the culmination of the romance (or lack thereof) was actually surprising, and a welcome change to the usual. That will be talked about in the spoiler section.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the other characters, they were...typical anime characters, who happen to also be badasses. I don't really have any complaints about any of them, but the world itself was lackluster at best. The anime introduces us to the technology used by the Cattia Empire, but only barely hints at their history. We get zero depth into their world, their struggle against the Dogishuans, their rise to galactic travel, or ANY OF THE OTHER RACES IN THE GALAXY! That in itself is sacrilege. So much potential for other alien goodness, and we get stuck with ONLY the cat/dog hybrids.\\n\\n\r\nThe assisdroids in the anime were probably one of the best parts. Tiny robots that you can dress how you like, and they assist you in any way they are capable. Now, a complaint on this part as well. I don't know if this is a result of the English translation, or if it was present in the Japanese version as well, because for the life of me I can't find any version other than English. However, to communicate, the assisdroids hold up signs with what they want to say on them (remnant of old Genma Saotome). It's explained later in the story why they can't talk. But I'm not exactly sure if this is just lazy translation work, or if it was meant to be comical, but the English words don't fit on the damn signs. The words stretch off the edges of the sign as if the translator left this as a last minute project and didn't have fucking time to go back and change/arrange the damn font. That has got to be the laziest crap I've seen in a while. It'd have been better to just leave the Japanese characters and put the damn subtitles at the bottom as is usual with translations.\\n\\n\r\nThe music was startlingly uninteresting. It is the \"generic brand anime music\" you'd expect from an anime about a bouncy catgirl. The dub (aside from Kio) was fine. The only time where the dub had any issues was when the different characters were actually singing a song. Instead of showing it from the back of the head like it did for most of them, when it came Kio's turn, it showed him from the front and exposed what was likely the worst anime mouth dubbing since Speed Racer. The song was nice at least. Alright, I'm done complaining now.\\n\\n\r\nOoOoO\\n\\n\r\nTLDR: If you like boobs, you'll be able to tolerate this anime. If you require anything more refined when watching anime, you'll wanna pass. The protagonist is as interesting as a husk of corn, the rest of the characters are on par, but not that memorable. The most memorable characters in the entire show were the assisdroids, and they never spoke a damn word. The story is scatter brained, the music is whatever, but the voice acting was alright. Honestly, unless you're super into this kinda anime, or are just in it for the T&A, then you'd be better off passing. And since for some reason this site deems 5 to be mediocre, and 4 to be decent which should be above mediocre, I'm giving this a 3 for poor.\\n\\n\r\nOoOoO\\n\\n\r\nSPOILER TALK:\\n\\n\r\nBest Girl: Manami, because she had literally the only legit reason for liking Kio. The others were so forced it was painful to watch.\\n\\n\r\nIt's amazing how three girls can be so in love with someone as uninteresting as the protagonist of this anime. It's painful to see. On the upside, the conclusion to the love story was pleasantly surprising. Or...it would be of it were anyone but Kio getting the attention.\\n\\n\r\nTypically in harem anime...if they ever resolve at all, end with the main protagonist getting together with one of the characters. Usually, the main heroine protagonist. This was slightly different however, in that the three girls in question agreed to all share him. That was an eyebrow lifting moment to be sure. That being said, it's like I mentioned. I'd have marked that as evolution in anime, willing to break the trope of \"Harem anime that doesn't resolve romantically,\" except for Kio. Seriously, the guy is a black hole of any kind of character traits.\\n\\n\r\nNothing against the writer or anything, but this whole series looked like a writer's first attempt, rough draft, etc. Either that or an anime advertisement for A&W restaurants, given how many times the damn logo made its way into the anime. I don't know if all of their works are like this, but I certainly hope Okina Kamino does better with their other stuff.\\n\\n\r\nThen again, maybe it's just me, or just the anime itself. Maybe I'm missing something from the manga that the anime left out. Either way, it was a day killer.",

It is only for a few moments though. \r\nI don\u00b4t think this story is quite well, because it is about aliens who try to befriend the human race, but you almost can't see any progress of that. And there are some slice of life episodes, but yeah you will always have that.\r\nThe characters are semi-original. The boy who seems innocent, but has dirty mags under his bed. An innocent looking girl with glasses who is in love with themain character and is actually a secret agent who uses all kinds and a lot of guns. The childhood friend who tries to get work at the CIA and acts like a Tsundere.\\n\\n\r\nIt is quite an older anime now, but it is still good. The art is fine, I have nothing to complain about that. Maybe I do, the art is pretty standard in comparison to other animes around those times of 2010.\\n\\n\r\nI'd recommend it if you would like to watch something short with a bit of action and comedy in it and if you can watch something with lewd moments in it without getting a nosebleed XD.\\n\\n\r\nI hope this was helpful.

            "content": "There will be some spoilers due to how the show wraps itself up being a main sticking point of the review. Fair warning.\r\nIt took me a while to remember I even watched this show several years ago on a whim. But it all came back to me mostly on how simple it was. It was a short binge and there was nothing particularly wrong with the show itself, but there's really nothing to it mostly due to how short it was and a refusal to commit to any particular mood or genre entirely. It's rated as high as is purely because visuals are decent andwhat little plot there is is in one piece despite this.\\n\\n\r\nThe premise is simple. Catgirl aliens have landed and are basically the best thing that's ever happened to humanity. The show tries to also play to the old \"government conspiracy\" trope by having various governments in league with dog aliens that have been trying to hide aliens and all that, but it never comes across as fully threatening to anything in a believeable way. We get a lot of tell not show of both factions and the whole thing just feels like a 'throw it in' gimmick to justify the catgirls. In that respect it fails to be a decent sci-fi show.\\n\\n\r\nMostly this show is billed as a harem comedy but it fails in both those respects as well. The harem consists of three girls with no real memorable qualities to speak of other than \"catgirl lead\", \"tsundere childhood friend\", and \"meek glasses girl.\" There's never any of the shifting dynamics or character development that you would normally get in this sort of genre. It's made clear from the start the girls all get along and even root for each other. The fact that they all just agree to share the generic protagonist in the end surprises nobody. The show also simply isn't all that funny so it's not particularly harem or comedy.\\n\\n\r\nThere's a protagonist. He's as bland as can be imagined. I wish there were more to this but I literally remember nothing about him and frankly the entire rest of the show could have taken place without him were a handful of girls not be in need of someone to kiss at.\\n\\n\r\nI don't even remember why I decided to watch this in the first place looking back. I know it's been a long time and while various scenes and episodes still stick out to me to remind me that I did, in fact, watch it, there was nothing cohesive or decisive about it. Not genuinely bad but otherwise incredibly bland.",

So it's funny in two ways at once.  I've watched it two or three times and it's always charming.

            "content": "To be honest, I almost felt embarassed when I first checked out a series that was called Cat Planet Cuties. I saw the trailer and my initial reaction was \"Seriously? Cat Women?\" As if the usual busty ecchi girls weren't sufficient, they had to add the cat ears and tails. But out of some sense of morbid curiousity, I checked out the first episode and was pleasantly surprised that I actually enjoyed it. And I made it through the full series.\r\nSTORY - 6/10\r\nIt's difficult to accurately gauge a story that is so obviously tongue-in-cheek. Everything about Cat Planet Cuties seems like an effort to nottake itself seriously, and so I think that a review has to take that into consideration. The story is silly and often makes no sense, but that's part of the show's charm - this is a series, after all, that is presenting alien races as cat-people and dog-people, and a pair of high school girls who masquerade as secret agents. It even goes so far as to have Eris proclaim that the cat-people once called their planet Earth, and themselves Earthlings, until they discovered our world and had to change the name of theirs to avoid confusion. \\n\\n\r\nLots of boobs, lots of guns, and lots of laughs are what you're going to get from this series. And if that provides you with any level of enjoyment, then the ludicrous story works. I honestly laughed more at this series than I have at most of the sitcoms that air on American TV these days. I thought that the humour was quite well done, and I found that the fanservice scenes often existed more as an attempt at humour than a real attempt to be sexy - almost as though the fanservice aspect itself was part of the tongue-in-cheek nature of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe only problem that I had was that on a couple of occasions, the show tries to get all serious, and it really doesn't work. It feels out of place with the tone of the overall show. One episode explores the nature of the assistaroids, and how they once looked like real people only to cause people to have unpredictable (and often negative) reactions towards them - leading to their existence in the show's present as silly-looking little robot cats. This could be an extremely interesting theme to explore in a more serious show - but it just feels strange smacked in the middle of this particular show.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe presentation is slick and polished. The series looks very nice aesthetically. The action scenes are well-animated (and there are lots of them). \\n\\n\r\nThere is a lot of fanservice in the show (which I consider to be part of the look/animation of the show). Normally this doesn't bother me at all, because in my experience it usually involves clearly-adult (or late teenage) women (identified by their rather large breasts). But I always feel a little uncomfortable when they show characters who appear to be underage in such poses, or outright nudity. So I took a point off for the show making me feel creepy when certain characters were shown in fanservice scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI watched the English dub and thought the voice acting was excellent (with the possible exception of the lead male). The female actors really brought it, adding another layer to their characters. The music fit really well with the various scenes, often adding to the silly tone, or pumping up the action sequences. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS - 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe male lead of this series, Kio, is just plain boring. I know that it's common in harem-type shows for the male to be a little dim and not react to the affections of the various women who are interested in him. But this show takes it to a whole different level. I'm almost tempted to think that they went so over-the-top on purpose, but whatever the reasoning it was a bit of a turn-off. \\n\\n\r\nThe three female leads proved interesting enough, though. Eris, the cat-woman, was probably the least interesting of the three, but the writers at least made an effort to give her more depth than just being eye candy. They did an excellent job, however, with Aoi and Manami, and they were really the heart of the show. All of the little assistaroids were charming, as well, and Kio's goofy uncle always made me laugh when he popped up. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAs a single male, I enjoy myself some fanservice. That said, I get easily bored if fanservice is all a show has to offer. I still need to be stimulated in some other way, be it with a good story, good humour, good drama - hell, even a decent romance. This show brought a good about of humour, and some solid action. I almost felt like it was being satirical of other fanservice shows, which was kind of intriguing. I have to admit that I enjoyed watching this a lot more than I expected to when I first turned it on.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nIf I was rating this series solely on whether it accomplishes what it sets out to, it would deserve a 9/10. If I was rating it against more serious, intellectual anime, it probably deserves a 5/10. So I just split the middle and gave it a 7.\\n\\n\r\nThe bottom line is that this show is entertaining in it's tongue-in-cheek way, and it kept me wanting to watch the next episode. It was full of laughs and action, and it showed quite a bit of charm. If you enjoy (or can tolerate) fanservice, I would recommend checking this one out. If you're looking for Shakespeare, you should probably pass.",

            "content": "For me, this was quite painful to watch. I powered through because I wanted to see how it ended, but I had to pause more than once to get the cringe out of my system before being able to go on.\r\nThe most painful thing for me is that the tone of the show is serious, but many silly events occur and they are played completely straight. Almost every character has a ridiculous/exotic backstory, with no justification for why so many unusual people happen to be involved. If it were a silly-themed show this would be fine (see: To Love Ru), but the show's serious themedemands some kind of justification for the craziness which just isn't there.\\n\\n\r\nPiled on top of this is a heavy helping of some of the worst puns I've ever heard.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe other major gripe I have with the show is that the writing seems lazy. It pulls lots of Deus Ex Machinas to steer the plot where it wants it to go and conveniently forgets about things when they go against the intended story direction. Some examples:\\n\\n\r\nWhen in the middle of the series they need a reason for a normal human to be able to take on a squad of alien attack robots, a new character shows up out of the blue and gives the human magical power stickers, with no proceeding explanation of who she is or why she's helping or even WHY MAGIC EXISTS IN THE UNIVERSE (it didn't up to that point).\\n\\n\r\nAnother example of this is when they introduce a character with a teleport ability. They have a whole scene where she demonstrates how she can teleport objects up to 50 meters. Then, in the very next scene a bad guy throws a flashbang at her and she just cringes and takes it instead of using the power she just demonstrated to teleport it away, resulting in the bad-guys escaping. If she were caught off-guard and had remorse for her mistake afterwords that would be fine, but she never even notices that teleportation was an option in that situation.\\n\\n\r\nThe leader of the good-guys has a multipurpose transmogrifier/organizer/weapon thing which she makes a big deal of pointing out is a weapon, and then despite it being involved in multiple battles throughout the remainder of the series it's never actually used as a weapon; Chekhov's gun is never fired.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIt's not entirely bad; the character arcs are decent if predictable and unlike many harems the protagonist manages to avoid being a doofus (although he is a bit oblivious). The references to other SciFi and fantasy shows are a nice touch (including Star Trek, Red Dwarf, I Dream of Jeanie, and Bewitched), and the theme song parodies can be fun.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI would advise my past self against starting this series, as the pain of viewing it was not worth the payoff of seeing the ending. If I was going to do it anyway though, I'd let my past self know that the first two episodes are prolog and very different from the rest of the show.",

            "content": "Asobi ni Iku yo is a light-hearted ecchi harem with a bit of an action focus. It involves a lot of craziness including aliens that look like cat girls and dog-girls, and with heroines that are all size d+. Asobi starts off as an instant girlfriend series, with the main, wimpy guy mysteriously attracting more girls as the series progresses. It goes through some wild subplots and eventually settles on the wildest twist of all, which takes you up to the ending of the series. If you're looking for a light (ECCHI) show, then this is your pick. If you're looking for some more seriousdrama.romance or anything remotely believable, look elsewhere.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nThis is pretty standard fare for its time. Colors are a bit saturated and the overall scenery relaxing (Okinawa, wha'd you expect?). The girls are okay but to be honest I don't think it's much of a competition between the 3 primary heroines (CAT GIRL vs. short-haired CIA wanna-be vs. shy but deadly girl with glasses). As is typical in a harem, these not-so average looking girls are attracted to a really plain looking wimp. I'm also not totally sold on the attire of the alien neko-girls, especially towards the end of the series.\\n\\n\r\nFor some reason they decided to make this action based (think sort of Princess Lover like; but not as focused and with a lot more heavy guns), I'm not completely sold on the approach, as it really takes the focus away from the actual characters. This means that there will be plenty of fighting (the series starts with one of these sequences) of okay quality with somewhat annoying CGI at times.\\n\\n\r\nAs a final note, this is an ECCHI series, there WILL be full top nudity and apparently the alien cats are armed with guns that DISINTEGRATE CLOTHES, creating almost an Ikkitousen scenario at times.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe sound is average. The OP and EDs (one per heroine) are all calming and light-pop to fit the atmosphere of a beach in Okinawa. The BGM isn't all that memorable and doesn't always give enough presence during important moments. Itou Kanae does the best job of the VAs here, overall good but not stand-out.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nKio is a rather boring guy who happens to end up stuck in the middle of a fight between anti-alien humans, a secret military organization (think like Mithril in FMP), a young girl with way too much money and a fetish for nekomimi, space cats, and space dogs. He befriends unusually strong heroines along the way as it eventually turns into world vs. the dogs.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the plot line is quite battle-focused near the end, you spend a lot of the early episodes lounging away in Okinawa with an occasional battle or two. The overall plot sequence isn't that bad but it is outrageous and quite unbelievable at times. There are a few tense moments but you never really bond with the characters that much detracts from any significant rising action.\\n\\n\r\nThe story really goes over the top near the climax and really pulls a wtf there. As there is a lot of focus on battles, you don't really get much time to spend with the actual characters as will be described next.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nSo yes, there's a standard guy who is completely dense when it comes to a girl's feelings. He apparently has three girls who really like him, two of which try to conceal this while the third cat-girl is pretty much like Lala in ToLoveRu. Since you know that the girls all harbor feelings for him, it's just a matter of them slowly trying to express this to him. Where as such a thing was so wonderfully executed repeatedly in Amagami SS, it is butchered here (it's never quite explained why the girls even like him- no being NICE is not a valid answer). Not only do you not get a sense of attachment to the characters, but their ridiculous fighting abilities just makes them feel all the more distant. This is one of the series where you just ask, is the guy really worth it?\\n\\n\r\nThe only redemption for this segment is the lively and innocent personality of Eris, especially when she goes into breeding-mode. But sometimes you can only take so much light-heartedness before you want something with a bit more substance.\\n\\n\r\nValue:\\n\r\nThis is a playful series that you can watch without really having to pay attention. Some of the crazy battles and armaments will draw some lols, but you won't be crying over any decisions and won't be dying to load up the next episode. Overall it's a very average harem. The series has come over to play, will you join in?",

Honestly this anime doesn't make a whole lot of sense and I believe the author should have taken it slow rather than rushing into the story and cramming all this stuff together. Anyhow the short version is Iwasn't very impressed,the storyline is confusing and rushed, and  there are a lot of gaps within the story.

            "content": "Asobi ni Iku yo, or in know in english as \"Cat planet cuties\" I will say looks phenomenal, but it immediately failed to disappoint me. The first episode did start off fairly well composed, with good action, and a semi decent plot. So here forth goes my third review.\r\n*There may be spoilers from this point on*\r\nThe first problem I immediately had was that Eris was far too playful and secondly Kio far too weak of a male character. The second I had was the stereotype of dogs vs cats, only that it was reversed this time. I did not see the main goal of thedogs since it isn't clearly defined, or it was so poor that I over saw it as just a cat fan service fest since all but one of the feline aliens is a girl, short of a very vague image from the past in a memory of a character that comes later on. Speaking of that character, it was too short of a plot to relate to her, and I found myself wanting to know more of the travels of her rather than the main adventure that was taking place. Thirdly I found the love square to be relatively annoying as well since it comes to /no/ conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nThose being my chief complaints, the story lacked refinement, and the excessive cuteness was a bit of a drain on some parts that could have had a strong emotional impact on the viewer. They should have spent more time on character development rather than large breasted cats, and small ones alike. They also introduced some characters out of no where with little to know explanation as to how they got there which was a bit odd. This considering how hard they tried to make this anime look like a \"huge\" thing by the credits. \\n\\n\r\nAny who this of course does not mean it was absolutely horrid. It's a good time filler, with good voice acting (dub) and a fairly cute art style that I enjoyed to watch. I would say watch this at your own risk for story, but if you just want to burn time, then go for it.",

There is nothing groundbreaking about it and the story is simple, but it's still a fun little series. The main appeal of the show is it's main character, Eris, who has a cat tail and cat ears. She is undeniably cute, as are Aoi and Manami. The story and development of side characters often plunder, but the three lead females keep the show enjoyable to watch through it's hiccups. They all have distinct personalities and work well off of each other. All of the other characters are prettyforgettable. Kio, the male lead is good enough, but doesn't really stand out in any way. If you enjoy fan service shows that actually show some nudity, then this will be up your alley. If you don't like those types of shows then this really doesn't have much for you. \\n\\n\r\nContent Rating - 17+ Nudity, Some Sexual Situations",

            "content": "Okay Lion Tamers, Here we go again !\r\nFirstly, I want to preface by making the point that this anime series is not meant for everybody. After all, the direct translation of the title \"Asobi ni Iku yo!\" means \"OK, let's play\". That means that there is no serious stuff going on in this show (although there are events that have powerful ramifications, but are never explored with serious intent).\r\nIf you are a hardcore porn/hentai/fetish addict, this anime is not for you.\r\nIf you are person who is knowledgable about this art form, because you know what the word \"ecchi\" and the like meanings, this show isnot for you either. After all, this thing was not only distributed by Funimation, but they contracted this one (as far as I've been able to read about it).\\n\\n\r\nSo who might like this show? \"Cat Planet Cuties\" is meant for the young person in their middle teens, somewhere between 12-18. It is not for young children, as there is some nudity in the show. It is not for the full adult artful person, as this program is not highbrow at any point. It is not meant for the 40-year old degenerate, as there is no sex whatever.\\n\\n\r\nSO what DOES this anime have going for it?\\n\\n\r\nFirstly, it has a very good basic plot, which employs the weaknesses and strengths of young people, to detect problems, assemble and collect data, and then find solutions. They don't always succeed, but trying counts in life, and should also count in anime. Eventually repeat attempts sometimes leads to solutions.\\n\\n\r\nSecond, the artwork, while not highbrow, is exactly what is needed for the eye-candy and sight-gags to work properly. There is even the occasional intermission, with some fairly good 3D film effects, showing water on a beach, or fish swimming in the ocean. \\n\\n\r\nThird, it contains some of the best title and end-title music of any anime I have watched, rivaling any main feature movie anywhere; most are fan-service entries to remind one of TV-Shows and Movies from 20 years ago (yes Virginia, there is even a great disco tune).\\n\\n\r\nFourth, the hero is the every kid, that dreams of saving the world from an interplanetary conflict, and getting the girl(s). While this might seem cliche, if we tell our children something is cliche, before they've even seen it, they won't know the charm of seeing it without the jaded vision of the person who sees cliche in everything.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, this show is for the person who just wants to have some fun watching young teenagers in a partial scifi plot; solve personal relationship problems, become astronauts, and ultimately save the world. It is literally what we all wanted to read or watch in the movies when we were all 15 years old.\\n\\n\r\nI am 60 years old, and I did not find it too corny. I found it fun, relaxing; and just a great fun time for the entire series. And by the way, the DVD of this also contains the OVA as part 13, for those that are watching the series only. Some of us, at the ripe old age of 25, are becoming far too impervious; to the extent that they may never remember what it was like to be young and want to challenge the world.\\n\\n\r\nI, for one, am glad I could remember. I give this anime an 8.",
